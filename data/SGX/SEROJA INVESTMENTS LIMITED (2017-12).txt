MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN 

 

We are pleased to present the first Sustainability Report (the “Report”) of 

Seroja Investments Limited (“Seroja” or the “Group”). This Report aims to 

discuss the challenges and material issues that are important to our 

stakeholders, our strategy in managing these challenges and issues, and how 

we have performed in terms of our key performance indicators. 

 

With growing expectations and importance of stakeholders’ concerns about 

companies’ abilities in tackling global issues, our Board believes that 

embedding sustainability efforts in decision-making is integral to the Group’s 

strategy and operations. 

 

The determination of the Group’s material ESG factors was conducted in the 

context of its business strategy through a structured process under the 

guidance of an independent external consultant.  

 

For our sustainable strategy, PT Pulau Seroja Jaya will continue to provide 

quality transportation services by: 

 



 Focusing on selected customers, prioritizing on long term value 

relationship 



 Renewing existing smaller and older vessels to ensure its vessel fleet is 

managed efficiently and effectively to provide higher returns 



 Providing value to our shareholders and employees 



 Additional major funding requirements only to support long term 

contracts from reliable and reputable customers.  

 

 

Mr Edwin Soeryadjaya 

Chairman

ORGANISATIONAL PROFILE 

Background 

Seroja Investments Limited, an investment holding company, provides marine 

cargo and coal transportation services in Indonesia mainly through its 

subsidiary company, PT Pulau Seroja Jaya in Indonesia. The Group operates 

through Freight Charter and Time Charter segments. The Group offers 

chartering services of tugboats and barges primarily to transport dry bulk 

freight comprising thermal coal, sand, and other quarry materials. As of 

December 31, 2017, it owned and operated a fleet of 68 vessels consisting of 

tugboats and barges, which primarily navigate waters around the Indonesian 

archipelago. The Group primarily serves coal and cement producers. Seroja 

Investments Limited was incorporated in 1983 and is based in Singapore. 

 

Our tugboats and barges are used to transport mainly thermal coal, as well 

as sand and other quarry materials. The thermal coal from coal mines are 

delivered to thermal power stations and cement companies which operate 

their own thermal power plants in Indonesia. Our major customers include PT 

Maritim Barito Perkasa which provides logistic services to PT Adaro Indonesia, 

a leading coal producer in Indonesia, PT Pelayarana Bahtera Adhiguna, a 

subsidary of PLN (national electricity company) and PT Indocement Tunggal 

Perkasa, one of Indonesia’s largest cement producers. We enter into freight 

or time charters which range from spot basis to contractual basis from a 

period of one to five years. Our freight charters typically involve domestic 

routes in Indonesia from Kalimantan to various ports in Java and Sulawesi 

while our time charters involve mainly domestic routes around the Sumatra 

Island. 

 

Our fleet of tugboats and barges is well maintained and in good conditions 

with an average age of less than 16 years. All of our tugboats are installed 

with Global Positioning System (GPS) to assist in deploying our vessels more 

efficiently as the GPS enables us to track and monitor the routes and 

locations of our vessels on real time basis.

ORGANISATIONAL PROFILE  

Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) 

In addition, Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) procedures are in place to 

identify major business risks and management regularly reviews the Group’s 

strategic, 

operational, 

financial 

and 

compliance 

risks 

through 

a 

precautionary approach. The key risks and impacts identified as follows: 

 



 Availability risk due to weather conditions and possible delay on regular 

docking activities and the impact may cause the Group in loss of 

revenue and profitability. 



 Customer/ Market Risk - finding the right customers who can provide 

sufficient volume and timely payments of services, down payments are 

now uncommon due to market conditions and the impact may also 

cause the Group in loss of revenue, profitability and liquidity. 



 Operational Risk- increasing downtime due to repairs and maintenance 

and may cause the Group in loss of revenue and profitability.    



 Reputation Risk due to possible incidents/ accidents with our vessel fleet 

and impact may cause the Group in loss of revenue, profitability and 

business relationship. 

 

 

Mission and Vision Statement 

As a preferred supplier of tugboats and barges chartering business to 

transport dry bulk freight in Indonesia for our selected customers, PT Pulau 

Seroja Jaya will continue to exceed expectations of delivering quality 

transportation service experience with passion and pride; and create value 

to all of our key stakeholders, including our customers, employees, 

shareholders and regulators.

ORGANISATIONAL PROFILE 

Supply Chain Management 

Reporting requirements and guidance for procurement practices and due 

diligence are in place. They include selection of suppliers/ subcontractors for 

non-appointed dealers and non-regular distributors for proper evaluation to 

ensure cost effectiveness and prevention of potential operational disruptions. 

 

External Initiatives 

We are currently reviewing potential activities to continually improve the 

environment and our community. We have contributed on ad-hoc basis to 

the community in our surrounding area where we operate in Banjarmasin 

during the festive season of Ramadhan and Christmas season. We hope to 

develop a sustainable plan in the near future where we want to provide 

contribution to the society in terms of the environment and economy in our 

surrounding area.

GOVERNANCE &amp; SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH 

Continual Commitment to Enhance Corporate 

Governance 

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) is committed to maintaining a high 

standard of corporate governance and transparency within the Group to 

protect the interests of its shareholders and enhance long-term shareholder 

value. This report describes the Company’s corporate governance processes 

and practices which have been adopted in line with the spirit of the Code of 

Corporate Governance 2012 (the “Code”), with specific reference to the 

principles and guidelines of the Code. 

 

The Company adheres largely to the principles and guidelines as set out in 

the Code, and endeavours to specify and explain any deviation from the 

Code. 

 

Whistle Blowing Policy 

As disclosed on page 23 of Seroja Investments Limited’s FY2017 Annual Report 

(under Principle 12 of our Corporate Governance Report), our Group has in place a 

whistle blowing framework for employees and other parties to report in 

confidence, without fear of reprisal, concerns about possible improprieties in 

matters of financial reporting or other matters. This policy is to assist the Audit 

Committee in managing allegations of fraud or other misconduct; disciplinary 

and civil actions that are initiated following the completion of the 

investigations are appropriate and fair; and actions are taken to correct the 

weakness in the existing system of internal processes which allowed the 

perpetration of the fraud and/or misconduct and to prevent recurrence. 

 

Sustainability Approach 

Our Group’s senior management periodically assesses focus areas where our 

Group can have the greatest economic, environmental and social impact, 

as well as the areas that are most important to our stakeholders. Senior 

management is responsible for the on-going communication to the Board of 

Directors. The Board will consider sustainability issues, e.g. environmental and 

social factors, as part of its strategic formulation.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

Financial Highlights 

The Group’s revenue increased by 3% or US$1.0 million from US$34.7 million in 

FY2016 to US$35.7 million in FY2017 due to both higher freight charter revenue 

as well as time charter revenue.  



 

Freight charter revenue increased by US$0.6 million from US$34.6 million 

in FY2016 to US$35.2 million in FY2017 due to higher average freight rate 

for the current financial year which is partly offset by lower shipment 

volume.  



 

Time charter revenue increased by US$0.4 million from US$0.1 million in 

FY2016 to US$0.5 million in FY2017. This was due to time charter contract 

secured with a new customer for the current financial year as 

compared to no significant time charter contract secured for FY2016 as 

customers prefer to charter under spot or per voyage basis due to 

weak freight rates.  

 

The breakdown of freight charter and time charter revenue for FY2017 and 

FY2016 is presented in the diagrams as follows:- 

 

 

Please refer to pages 6 and 33 of Seroja Investments Limited’s FY2017 Annual 

Report for the financial performance of the Group. Targets are set by taking 

into account performance over the past year in order to incentivise 

continuous and sustained improvement.

ENERGY 

Our Group provides marine cargo and coal transportation services in 

Indonesia. The recovery in oil price has partly contributed to the increase in 

demand for coal which is a cheaper source of energy. There is no let-up by 

the Indonesian government to build more coal-fired power plants to fuel its 

economy. These will result in higher coal demand and keep our vessels busy 

as significant coal cargoes need to be transported due to the rivers and seas 

separating the coal mines and coal-fired power plants. 

We are aware of the importance in managing our energy and resources to 

improve our overall operational efficiency. Our continuous concern is to 

manage and control the fuel usage for our fleet of vessels. This is crucial as 

we will be increasing our fleet to focus on longer voyages, where timing and 

overall fuel usage will be the main drivers for our operational efficiency and 

hence profitability. 

Our other energy conserving effort will be to focus on our office and staff. We 

will be informing our staff to develop initiatives on how they can conserve 

energy starting from themselves i.e. switch off lights and air con after office 

hours. We continuously work towards reducing energy consumption and that 

our usage is reduced on a yearly basis.

EMPLOYMENT 

Our Group believes in investing in people as our employees are our most 

valued asset. We focus on providing equal access to opportunities for all our 

employees. With equality and diversity as our ethos, we aim to develop our 

employees in all aspects so they are equipped to address the challenges in 

the ever-changing global landscape. 

 

To underscore our care and commitment towards our employees, we have 

established policies and practices which we put in place to focus on fair 

employment practices by ensuring equal opportunities for recruitment, fair 

compensation, career progression and training opportunities. 

 

We are fully committed to comply with all applicable labour laws where we 

operate and ensure compliance through on-going monitoring. In addition, 

we ensure that we adhere to the maximum overtime hours allowed per staff 

with sufficient rest between work shifts. Where living accommodation is 

provided, the condition and quality of such accommodation provided are 

checked periodically by our Welfare Staff.  

 

Our people 

Identifying, recognising and rewarding quality employees are essential in our 

hiring and retention strategy. We advocate fair employment practices by 

ensuring equal opportunities for recruitment, fair compensation, career 

progression and training opportunities.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH &amp; SAFETY 

The Group is committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for 

employees, contractors, customers and community members. In doing so, 

the company will comply with all laws and regulations, related practice rules 

and standards. This includes ensuring that the environment and work 

equipment are safe. To achieve a good system for both employees’ health 

and work safety, we have in place policies and procedures under the QHSE 

Management System and Resources to provide information and training 

requirements for all employees. The employees are encouraged to 

participate in improving health and safety in the workplace through their 

respective line managers or through communication with or being part of the 

QHSE Community. This committee has an important role in monitoring health 

and safety in the workplace and reduce the incidents rate in accordance 

with the continuous improvement approach under our QHSE System. 

  

We recognize that hazards can pose psychological problems and risks. These 

hazards can arise from the work environment, equipment or interaction with 

people. Management and Staff will participate in identifying systematic 

hazards and risk management. Management and Staff will also ensure health 

and safety by carrying out Inspection through tests and audit procedures. 

Health and safety in the workplace are joint responsibilities of employees and 

management. All employees must give reasonable attention to their own 

health and safety and to the health and safety of their colleagues. Both 

employee and management will cooperate to ensure a safe and healthy 

environment for all to work in.
