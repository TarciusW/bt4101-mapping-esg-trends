SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 



BUILDING A FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESS

Geo’s Journey to Success

We are pleased to present our second 

annual sustainability report, which 

has again been prepared in accordance 

with the Global Reporting Initiative’s 

(GRI) Standards: Core option. Drawing 

on these reporting guidelines, we 

focus on the key material issues for 

our businesses. Further details on the 

approach, boundaries and scope of this 

sustainability report can be found in the 

GRI Content Index from page 50. 

Standard units of measurement are used 

in this report and conversion factors, 

where applicable, are explained in their 

respective sections. 

This sustainability report outlines our 

practices, initiatives and impacts for our 

operations in Indonesia and our offices in 

Singapore and Jakarta during the period 

from 1 January to 31 December, 2018. We 

aim to expand the scope of our reporting 

in the coming years to include all our 

Singapore and overseas operations and 

related data. The financial statements of 

our businesses can be found in our Annual 

Report 2018, which can also be found on 

our company’s website. This sustainability 

report has not been externally verified or 

assured. We will review the need to engage 

an external assurer for our report in the 

coming years. 

We appreciate feedback from our 

stakeholders on our sustainability report 

and any of the topics covered here. Please 

contact us at investor_ relations@geocoal.

CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO’S STATEMENT

“DEFINING THE NEW STANDARDS IN  

SUSTAINABILITY FOR INDONESIAN COAL”

Dear Stakeholders,

 On behalf of the Board of Directors, it is 

my great pleasure to present to you Geo 

Energy’s second Sustainability Report. The 

Group reached a major milestone in 2018 

as Geo Energy began coal production in 

its TBR coal mine in June 2018. By signing 

a life of mine coal offtake agreement with 

Macquarie in November 2018, we ensured 

that TBR will be a key driver of sustainable 

growth for Geo Energy – delivering stable 

returns for our shareholders, and lasting 

prosperity for our local stakeholders.

The agreement includes multi-year 

prepayment facilities and trade finance, 

together with a 5% equity investment in Geo 

Energy.

We are especially pleased to have won the 

support of Macquarie for this important 

expansion of our business activities, as this 

Australian bank is known for its strong 

support of sustainability and its global role 

in the growth of green finance. We see 

Macquarie’s confidence in Geo Energy’s 

performance as validation of our business 

and sustainability strategy – as well as an 

obligation to maintain and further raise the 

standards we apply in the interest of all our 

stakeholders.

As part of the due diligence for this 

transaction, Geo Energy undertook a major 

review of all its operations and governance 

structures – which included the operations 

of our strategic mining partner BUMA. 

In January 2019, this review culminated 

in the development of an overarching 

Environmental and Social Management 

System (ESMS) by a leading global provider 

of environmental, health, safety, risk, and 

social consulting services.

The ESMS covers Geo Energy’s material 

sustainability issues in great detail and 

includes topics such as air quality and soil 

management procedures, waste management 

and disposal, as well as workplace health and 

safety procedures and a detailed Stakeholder 

Engagement Plan with a strong focus on local 

communities. 

Together with BUMA, we are now in the 

process of implementing the various detailed 

measures included in the ESMS. Overseeing 

this process is Mr. Karyono, formerly one of 

Geo Energy’s independent directors, who 

has resigned from that role and became our 

Head of Operation and is now coordinating 

the implementation of the ESMS between 

the operational teams at the two mining 

sites, Geo Energy Group and BUMA. We 

are looking forward to reporting on them in 

greater detail in future sustainability reports.

As our engagement with sustainability 

has thus intensified during the reporting 

period, we are pleased that our review of 

material issues in preparation for this report 

confirmed the solid foundation created by 

our inaugural sustainability report which 

was published last year. In line with the 

benchmark we established last year, this 

report meets SGX reporting requirements 

and is published in accordance with the GRI 

Standards: Core Option.

As a leading Indonesian coal producer, our 

material issues span environmental, social 

and governance issues and you will find this 

report’s structure improved to provide greater 

clarity on the importance Geo Energy is 

placing on each of these sustainability topics.

Protecting Our People

In 2018, Geo Energy continued its strong 

performance with regard to worker health and 

safety. We are extremely pleased to report that 

there were zero fatalities, no serious injuries 

and no man-days lost after the employees of 

Geo Energy and BUMA contributed more 

than 7 million man-hours of their work. While 

this is a very impressive result, we expect that 

the ESMS will lead to even closer collaboration 

between Geo Energy and BUMA, further 

strengthening Geo Energy’s overall health and 

safety efforts and improving the well-being 

of workers across Geo Energy’s entire supply 

chain.

Community Engagement

In 2018, we increased the coordination of 

CSR activities with BUMA, including joint 

budgeting for our community investment 

programmes. Our joint investments 

amounted to approximately IDR 7.9 billion 

and aimed to improve the well-being and 

prosperity of communities in the vicinity of 

our mining sites in lasting, sustainable ways. 

Focusing on core parts of community life, 

we invested in

- Infrastructure, by drilling wells, installing 

water tanks, replacing wooden bridges 

with solid concrete, and stabilising roads 

and pathways;

- Education, through scholarships for 

outstanding students from poor families 

and facilitating training for teachers in 

village schools;

- Health, by providing improved nutrition 

for children and elderly citizens; and

- Art, Culture and Religion, by providing 

musical equipment and art supplies as 

well as helping with the development  

of mosques.

We continue to engage regularly with the 

communities we are part of, to ensure these 

measures have lasting, positive effects and 

that we are providing the best possible 

support.

Protecting the Environment

Minimising the environmental impact of 

our operations has always been one of our 

highest priorities. Still, we are grateful that 

the analysis and review that led to our new 

ESMS has highlighted areas where we can 

further intensify our efforts and improve 

our procedures in line with international 

best practices. Implementing the ESMS over 

the course of 2019 will allow Geo Energy to 

increase its focus on the environment and 

the effectiveness of measures concerning 

all environmental aspects at its mining 

sites, including air quality, protection of 

biodiversity protection, soil management, 

waste and effluents, and the visual impact of 

our mining activities on the landscape. 


GEO ENERGY GROUP

05

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 

As the ESMS is being implemented, we will 

be reporting on all these measures in greater 

detail in our next sustainability reports. We 

are looking forward to your ongoing feedback 

on our performance in this respect and to 

your continued support.

Continued Improvements to Our 

Reporting Practice

This report built on our initial effort in 2017 

and gave us an opportunity to review our 

sustainability strategy and the commitments 

we have made to our broad range of 

stakeholders. While our material issues have 

passed the test and remain representative 

of our most important sustainability 

challenges, we realised that more work 

is needed to close the remaining gaps in 

our ESG-related data. Again, the ESMS 

will provide a valuable tool in this respect, 

especially as it involves measures and 

specific procedures that extend beyond Geo 

Energy’s own operations to include our most 

important supply chain partners.

Please do not hesitate to send us your 

thoughts on this report and our activities. 

Your feedback will help us further optimise 

our sustainability strategy.

We remain committed to being a sustainable 

and responsible low cost Indonesian coal 

producer, and continue to develop our 

sustainability strategy in the best interest 

of all our stakeholders, including investors, 

employees and the communities around 

our mines. As we continue to uphold high 

standards of transparency and corporate 

governance we remain firmly committed 

to sustainably grow our business, while  

constantly improving our processes and 

remaining accountable to our communities, 

stakeholders and shareholders.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 

GEO ENERGY’S APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY

Our Sustainability Framework

Sustainability and corporate social responsibility 

have been key considerations for Geo Energy from 

the very beginning. Geo Energy is committed 

to creating long-term shareholder, consumer 

and employee value by executing a strategy 

aimed at minimising environmental impact and 

considering key social, cultural, environmental 

as well as economic aspects. We established an 

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Working 

Group to devise, implement and maintain our 

ERM framework and to ensure that the Group’s 

sustainability risks and issues are managed 

effectively. And it goes without saying that we 

are committed to complying with the laws and 

regulations of the jurisdiction in which we operate.  

We emphasize the health and safety of our people, 

including our employees, contractors and local 

communities by continually improving the 

health and safety standards for our operations, 

by minimising the risk of accidents, injuries 

and illness. Environmental stewardship and 

management is very important to our relationships 

with local communities, regulators and others.  

We consider environmental management to be a 

part of overall good governance.

How We Manage Sustainability 

We recognise that our commitment to 

sustainability and ESG issues is part of being a 

responsible business. It also helps us mitigate the 

risk in our operations and allows us to maintain 

the social license to operate. 

Our Sustainability Framework

CREATING LONG TERM VALUE BY EXECUTING A STRATEGY AIMED AT MINIMISING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT







by establishing a framework to manage ESG risks 

internally and externally for our business. 

Together with the business and corporate 

executive heads, the ERM Working Group 

identifies our operational, financial and compliance 

risks and sets out the appropriate mitigating 

actions and monitoring mechanisms to respond 

to these risks and changes within the Group and 

the external business environment. In addition, 

Management also engages with internal and 

external auditors to evaluate and perform tests of 

certain controls relevant to improving the Group’s 

internal control system as well as to the preparation 

of the Group’s financial statements. 

We work collaboratively with stakeholders to 

ensure that we keep channels of communication 

open and talk about issues that are important 

to our stakeholders. To ensure the longevity of 

our business, we recognise that communicating 

with our stakeholders is imperative. We ensure 

continual communication with regulators and 

investors, which is central to our ambition to be 

our industry’s trusted partner.

We are aware of the fact that our business 

operations have an impact on the natural 

environment. The risks and impacts associated 

with the industry we operate in are manifold and 

we try our best to identify, evaluate and prevent 

these risks wherever possible. Where this is not 

possible, we mitigate risks as much as possible,

OUR MATERIALITY

This report has been produced in line 

with the GRI principles for defining 

report content, sustainability context, 

materiality, completeness and stakeholder 

inclusiveness. 

Our material issues have been identified 

by referring to the internationally 

recognised GRI Standards and AA1000’s 

Accountability Principles Standard for 

Materiality Assessment, using the GRI 

four-step cyclical process consisting of 

identification of key material ESG issues, 

prioritisation, validation and review. 

The process of identification involved 

working with an independent consultant 

who supported us by conducting research 

on the relative importance of these issues 

for stakeholders, reviewing the relevant 

best practices in the mining industry, 

looking at what our peers are considering 

to be material and evaluating the impacts 

of our operations on the environment. 

Our Materiality

Once we had identified our material issues, 

we conducted two Materiality Assessment 

workshops in 2017, one in Singapore, 

where our corporate office is located, and 

another in Jakarta. These were attended 

by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), 

Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Investment 

Director, other members of the senior 

management team, and business heads from 

human resources, finance, marketing, legal 

and operations.

We asked the attendees to prioritise the

gain perspective on how significant these 

issues are to our internal stakeholders and 

via proxy for our external stakeholders. We 

also conducted a stakeholder engagement 

survey for our external stakeholders after our 

materiality was finalised to get feedback from 

them. See section “Our Engagements” below 

for more detail.

GRI Standards disclosure 102-47

Each material issue was discussed in detail 

and, based on its importance to our business 

and the external environment, was given an 

impact rating of ‘low’, ‘medium’ or ‘high’, from 

both the internal and external perspectives 

in relation to our sustainable development 

performance. These issues were prioritised 

at the workshops and the results collated. 

We then categorised highly material issues 

as top tier issues and high-to-medium issues 

as second tier. Both tiers are covered in our 

sustainability report. 

In preparation for this year’s report, we 

undertook a review of our materiality, 

to ensure that our material issues stay 

relevant. This review entailed a group-wide 

sustainability workshop and self-assessment 

exercise in December 2018 to identify, assess 

and discuss the various material risks that 

the Group currently or potentially faces. 

The Sustainability Committee reviewed 

and approved the results of this assessment, 

which concluded that there was no change 

to our material issues as determined in 

2017.

Through our due diligence process, we have 

determined the boundary for each of our 

material issues. These issues impact all our 

operations in Indonesia and the following 

stakeholders, as listed below: 

OUR MATERIALITY


GEO ENERGY GROUP

We recognise that our operations have 

impacts on our stakeholders. In turn, our 

stakeholders have an impact on how we 

create value for them. Having regular, 

open and honest engagements with our 

stakeholders helps us identify, understand 

and prioritise the sustainability topics 

that matter most to our stakeholders and 

to our business. We identify areas where 

it is imperative to get feedback from 

our stakeholders, for example concerns 

they may have about land reclamation 

procedures post closure of mines and other 

issues which may be sensitive and impact 

our stakeholders’ rights. 

Following our materiality review in 2018, 

we conducted an online survey with 

internal as well as a significantly expanded 

list of external stakeholders to rank our 

material issues and to provide them with 

an opportunity to give their independent 

assessment on how well we are managing 

these issues. Survey participants also had 

the opportunity to suggest additional 

material issues. We are encouraged by the 

Initial results of this survey indicating that 

our stakeholders are in overall agreement 

with our determined material issues and 

approve of the way Geo Energy is managing 

these issues. This survey was conducted in 

the second quarter of 2019 and we will be 

reporting on the results in greater detail in 

next year’s sustainability report.

Meanwhile we are pleased to report that 

in reponse to feedback received by some of 

our stakeholders in last year’s stakeholder 

engagement exercise, we significantly 

increased our community outreach and

For an overview of our regular 

stakeholder engagement channels and 

how we are continuing to integrate 

sustainability related topics in 

conversations with our key stakeholders 

based on our activities planned (at the 

phase of exploration, development and 

operation), please see the following table. 

Compared to our 2017 Sustainability 

Report, you will notice a significant 

increase in the number of stakeholders 

to be engaged. This is a direct result of 

the ESMS that was developed following 

the equity and offtake agreement with 

Macquarie.

The ESMS includes a dedicated 

Stakeholder Engagement Plan and 

Grievance Mechanism which we will 

continue to update as our sustainability 

efforts evolve. We will be reporting on 

the implementation of these measures in 

our future sustainability reports.

As part of our Stakeholder Engagement 

Plan, we have also revised our Grievance 

Mechanism whereby stakeholders 

and interested parties including local 

communities, Geo’s subsidiaries, mining 

operators, third-party sub-contractors

OUR MATERIALITY

We listen with an open

and service provides, may raise their 

complaints, concerns and observations 

associated with the mining activities. It is 

designed so that we can address genuine 

concerns in a timely and agreeable manner. 

Going forward, the Grievance Mechanism 

will apply to Geo Energy’s own operations 

as well as to all sub-contractors on site. It 

was designed to generally comply with the 

IFC Performance Standards and ensures 

that affected stakeholders can provide 

feedback free from external manipulation, 

interference, coercion, or intimidation.

As a listed company, shareholders will 

always be a group of stakeholders that is 

instrumental to Geo Energy’s continued 

success and to the sustainability of our 

business. We recognise that there is a growing 

trend, especially in Asia, for shareholders to 

get more actively involved in the companies 

they are invested in. Demands by so-called 

Shareholder Activists are usually focused 

on key board matters such as Board 

representation and diversity, return on 

capital, as well as mergers and acquisitions.



Geo Energy’s Management and its Board 

of Directors welcome these opportunities 

for greater engagement with this key 

stakeholder group. Through periodic 

meetings with investors our management 

ensures an open line of communication 

to pre-empt emerging concerns including 

in relation to Geo Energy’s executive 

management.

The Company and the Board are regularly 

reviewing Geo Energy’s business portfolio 

and examining it through the lens of 

an investor. Management listens with 

an open mind to shareholder concerns, 

takes criticism of corporate governance 

and strategy very seriously, and responds 

appropriately to this target audience via 

investor engagement roadshows, AGMs 

and public relations campaigns. Thus, we 

ensure that concerns and constructive 

ideas from our shareholders are always 

given appropriate consideration.

OUR MATERIALITY


GEO ENERGY GROUP

14



The Group is committed to a high standard 

of compliance with industry requirements 

and any legislation relating to trading, 

accounting, financial reporting, internal 

controls, corporate governance and auditing.

At Geo Energy, we have established 

governance structures for managing 

sustainability in our operations. Our CEO 

is the most senior person responsible for 

sustainability and has maintained oversight 

of our material issues by personally 

overseeing our groupwide materiality review 

workshop and by verifying the identified 

material issues. As part of regular quarterly 

updates, the CEO is receiving updates on all 

relevant sustainability performance issues. 

To ensure that potential issues are 

identified throughout the organisation and 

addressed in a timely manner, all Heads of 

Departments discuss relevant sustainability 

issues and the impact on our daily 

operations and the Group’s performance in 

monthly management meetings. 

Where such issues are found to have an 

impact on our corporate risk assessment, 

our ERM Committee, comprising our CFO, 

Financial Controller, Investment Director, 

and all Heads of Departments will report on 

these issues to the CEO and subsequently 

to the Board.  No major ESG related issues 

were identified in 2018.

Our CEO is also a member of the Board, 

thus ensuring close interaction between Geo 

Energy’s Board and management and thereby 

satisfying principle 3.1 of SGX-ST Listing 

Rules, Practice Note 7.6, which assigns 

ultimate responsibility for Geo Energy’s 

sustainability reporting to the Board. 

Our Corporate Governance Report 

describes the Group’s corporate governance 

framework and practices in compliance with 

the principles and guidelines of the Code 

of Corporate Governance 2012 (the 2012 

Code). The Group confirms that it adheres 

to the principles and guidelines as set out in 

the 2012 Code where applicable and there 

have been no deviations from the Code. 

Governance

MAINTAINING HIGH STANDARD OF COMPLIANCE

GOVERNANCE

As part of the preparations for the 

agreement with Macquarie, we have 

undertaken a thorough review of our 

ESG related policies. This review, which 

was conducted with the support of 

an international consultancy, led to 

the development of a comprehensive 

Environmental and Social Management 

System (ESMS), which was built on our 

original Safety, Health, and Environment 

(SHE) Policy. The ESMS has far-reaching 

implications for all our operations, and 

redefines the way we are collecting and 

analysing our ESG related data. As we work 

to implement the ESMS, we are thereby 

putting in place the remaining pre-requisites 

for determining the baseline and appropriate 

targets for our sustainability related issues. 

We will be disclosing these targets in our 

next sustainability report. 

Our Board of Directors has established 

high standards for employees, officers 

and directors. The principal function of 

the Board, in addition to carrying out its 

statutory responsibilities, is to oversee the 

formulation of and approve the Group’s 

overall long-term strategic objectives and 

direction. 

In doing so the Board is taking into 

consideration sustainability issues, reviewing 

the management of the Group’s business 

affairs, financial controls, performance, 

resource allocation, and establishing a 

framework of prudent and effective controls 

to assess and manage risks and safeguard 

shareholders’ interests and the Group’s assets. 

For more information on Board matters, 

please refer to the Corporate Governance 

Report in our Annual Report 2018.

The Corporate Governance Report can 

be found on pages 23 to 35 of our Annual 

Report 2018. 

Policies

Mining is a heavily regulated industry with a 

host of laws and regulations the Group is in 

compliance with. To help comply with these 

regulations, we have internal company-wide 

policies and standard operating procedures 

(SOPs) in place to provide us with the 

requisite framework. 

Our Employee Handbooks are written 

in compliance with Singapore’s and 

Indonesia’s employment legislation. The 

policies and procedures contained in the 

handbooks govern the terms and conditions 

of employment for all employees of Geo 

Energy. 

The new ESMS (please see Governance 

section above) is currently being 

implemented and involves Geo Energy’s 

operational units in the SDJ and TBR mines 

working collaboratively with BUMA to 

ensure that all environmental, health and 

safety risks are managed well for the entire 

group. (Please see page 11 for an overview 

of our ESMS governance structure.) We 

believe an effective policy framework should 

include a complementary set of measures 

that guides our organisation by outlining 

our values and principles. The ESMS 

includes a comprehensive set of training 

measures and scheduled as well as ad hoc 

audits to ensure full compliance. We look 

forward to reporting on the successful 

implementation of our ESMS in our next 

Sustainability Report. 

Ethics and Integrity

We are committed to maintaining a high 

standard of corporate governance to ensure 

the sustainability of the Group’s business as

GOVERNANCE

well as safeguard shareholders’ interest and 

create long term value and returns for our 

shareholders. 

We have a strict and firm stance against 

bribery and corruption. Our employees, 

if found in non-compliance with anti-

corruption and anti-bribery principles may 

face disciplinary action or termination. 

For 2018, Geo Energy had zero confirmed 

cases of corruption. Lastly, our CSR 

activities are aligned with the Group’s 

principles of good corporate governance. 

We always strive to ensure a positive impact 

from our operations on all our stakeholders. 

Whistleblowing

Geo Energy’s whistleblowing policy applies 

to all directors and employees, including 

full-time, part-time and contract employees 

of Geo Energy, its subsidiaries (together 

with the Group entities) and external 

parties. The whistleblowing policy aims 

to provide an avenue for employees and 

external parties to raise concerns and offer 

reassurance that they will be protected from 

reprisals or victimisation for whistleblowing 

in good faith. 

Compliance

Geo Energy continues to uphold the highest 

standards as we ensure we comply with 

domestic and local laws and regulations. In 

addition to local regulatory requirements, 

we also work to ensure compliance with 

all relevant environmental and social 

requirements and to uphold international 

good practice standards.

For 2018, Geo Energy has had zero cases of 

non-compliance with social and economic 

laws and regulations.

Human Rights 

Geo Energy respects the basic human rights 

of our employees and contract workers and 

upholds, in spirit, international human 

rights conventions such as the International 

Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions. 

We are working towards improving the 

human rights aspects of our operations. 

However, during the reporting period, there 

were no significant investment agreements 

and contracts that included human rights 

clauses or that underwent human rights 

screening.

Risk Identification and Management 

The Board is responsible for the identification 

and governance of risk. We formed an ERM 

Working Group, in consultation with our 

internal auditor – PricewaterhouseCoopers 

(PwC), to devise and implement an ERM 

framework in 2013. The ERM framework 

is designed to manage the Group’s risks 

and is approved by the Board, taking into 

consideration the nature and extent of the 

significant risks which the Board is willing to 

take in achieving its strategic objectives. The 

ERM Working Group reviews all significant 

control policies and procedures on an 

ongoing basis and highlights all significant 

matters to the Board. 

At the operational level, key management 

personnel of the respective business units 

– the risk owners – identify potential risks. 

This information is then forwarded to the 

ERM Working Group, which conducts an 

annual risk workshop to assist the Group 

in identifying and prioritising the top risks 

affecting the Group as well as to provide 

countermeasures for the risks identified. 

All identified risks are assessed, analysed 

and prioritised by their level of importance. 

The ERM Working Group then outlines a 

course of action to minimise the impact 

from these risks as well as the expected costs 

incurred in relation to the mitigating action. 

Each prioritised risk is then assigned to its 

respective Risk Owner who is responsible 

for monitoring, controlling and reporting 

on the status and effectiveness of each risk 

response action to the ERM Working Group. 

In 2018, the annual risk workshop was held 

on December 4.

Geo Energy has clear and robust 

governance structures in place to ensure 

that relevant risks and issues are managed 

effectively within the organisation. Senior 

Management and the Board of Directors 

are engaged on sustainability issues insofar 

as they constitute operational, financial or 

compliance risks to the Group, such as risks 

that may result from accidents at our mines 

(worker health and safety, environmental 

damage) or from any instances of 

noncompliance with regulations locally or in 

our capacity as a listed entity.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE &amp; PROCUREMENT PRACTICES

Geo Energy’s economic performance 

is important for shareholders and 

employees, government and communities, 

particularly in terms of tax contributions, 

royalties, procurements and our ongoing 

CSR programmes. Economic growth is 

considered a key material issue at Geo 

Energy as driving a profitable energy 

portfolio is the primary way we are able to 

create value for all our stakeholders. The 

Group’s economic performance has had a 

positive impact on the internal and external 

environment of the organisation. 

Geo Energy’s Indonesia-based assets 

contribute to the economy of Indonesia 

by contributing to the prosperity of the 

communities in which we operate through 

job creation and Geo Energy’s extensive 

community investment programmes. 

(Please see section Our Community Impact 

below for details.) They are among the basic 

resources that form the building blocks 

of the Indonesian economy. Our business 

growth and economic performance 

positively impact our employees and 

stakeholders as we generate economic 

value and provide continued employment 

opportunities to our employees. 

Through our SDJ mine we have contributed 

to the creation of more than 2000 jobs, 

mostly mining workers employed directly 

at the SDJ mine. The commencement of 

operations at TBR mine added  

38 new jobs at the mining site and we 

anticipate further growth in 2019. (The 

equity investment and offtake agreement 

with Macquarie that allowed us to start 

operations at TBR was only completed in 

November 2018.) 

Our direct economic value generated and 

distributed in 2018 is outlined on page 7 of 

our 2018 Annual Report. For more detailed 

information on our economic performance 

during 2018, please refer to the Financial 

Statements on pages 49 to 121 of our 

Annual Report 2018. 

Driving a proﬁtable 

energy portfolio is 

the primary way to 

create value for our 

stakeholders

Economic 

Performance

We undertake actions to understand 

the social and economic environment, 

recognise key stakeholders and identify the 

possible social impacts of our operations. 

We also work closely with our business 

partners to understand our collective 

impact and the best approach to work 

together more effectively. Our CSR officer 

extensively engages the community in 

our CSR programmes from inception 

in order to tailor our programmes to 

the community’s needs and preferences. 

Our CSR activities include educational, 

healthcare, economic and social culture 

programmes (please see section ‘Our 

Community Impact’ on page 41 and 42 for 

details). As part of Geo Energy’s broader 

economic contribution, we also invest in 

partnerships, programmes and initiatives 

that help support and improve local 

communities.

Geo Energy has established sound 

processes and solid governance structures 

around its procurement activities. Internal 

policies cover criteria and processes for 

purchases and payables as well as the 

selection and annual evaluation of vendors. 

These policies provide clear guidance on all 

our purchasing activities and are effective 

safeguards against all forms of corruption. 

These policies do not yet explicitly recognise 

other ESG criteria but as part of our ESMS 

(please see section ‘Policies’ above) we are 

now in the process of developing a Local 

Recruitment and Procurement Plan, to enable 

the Group to have clear processes in place 

and to align procurement practices with our 

headquarters’ HR policy. 

We recognise the importance of our 

relationship with local small businesses and 

we endeavour to support them by sourcing 

services locally where possible. 

Our strategy is to create independent and 

strong local communities by focusing 

on social, economic and environmental 

aspects in the areas where we operate, 

such as education, health, environmental 

hygiene, water availability and creating 

the financial conditions that will help local 

communities to improve their standard of 

living.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 

Our 

Employees

At Geo Energy, we employ from the local 

communities in which we operate wherever 

that is possible, thus providing livelihoods to 

local stakeholders. We employ local workers 

and provide them with relevant training and 

opportunities for developing their skills. 

We also seek to support and promote local 

businesses and economic activity by engaging 

members of local communities as suppliers. 

We currently procure food supplies from 

local suppliers around our mine sites. 

Employee Profile

As at 31 December 2018, Geo Energy has 

employed a total of 197 employees, of which 

147 are male (75%) and 50 are female (25%). 

The high ratio of male to female employees 

is mainly due to the nature of our business, 

hence we have more male than female job 

applicants. 

100% of our 197 employees work full-time 

with us. Of the 197 full-time employees, 

12% or 24 of our employees are hired on 

a fixed contract term/temporary basis 

while 88% or 173 employees are hired on 

a permanent basis. The gender breakdown 

of our permanent and fixed contract term/

temporary employees are depicted in the 

charts below. 

Of the total number of 197 employees, 177 

employees are based in Indonesia where our 

mining operations are, and the remaining  

20 employees are based in our Singapore 

office. Activities of Geo Energy’s Singapore 

office are performed by worked who 

are permanent employees. However, in 

Indonesia a sizeable proportion of activities 

are performed by workers who are on fixed 

contract term or temporary basis. They are 

mostly involved in mining activities. 

The hiring of contract workers following 

our standard company procedures complies 

with government regulations. All seasonal 

workers’ contracts respect government 

regulations and we ensure that they 

understand their rights and responsibilities.

In Singapore, the duration of contracts 

depends on the specific requirements of the 

position, while in Jakarta, the duration is 

typically between six months and one year. 

At the mining sites, contract duration ranges 

from six months to three years (which is 

the maximum number of years permissible 

under Indonesian law). In all cases, we 

are open to contract workers becoming 

permanent staff, if that is warranted by the 

contract workers’ performance and our 

Group companies’ requirements.

The breakdown of employees by employment 

contract for our Singapore and Indonesia 

office is shown in the chart below.

Non-Discrimination, Equal Opportunity 

and Diversity in the Workplace

Geo Energy does not discriminate in 

employment opportunities or practices 

because of race, colour, religion, gender, 

national origin, age or disability. We believe 

in gender equality and equal opportunity 

for all team members. Recruitment 

and career progression are based on a 

meritocratic approach. In order to provide 

equal employment and advancement 

opportunities to all individuals, 

employment decisions in the Company are 

based on merit, qualifications, and abilities. 

Our commitment to fair labour practices is 

emphasised in our employee handbook and 

employment practices.

Employees with questions or concerns 

about discrimination in the workplace are 

encouraged to bring these issues to the 

attention of their supervisor. Employees 

can raise concerns and make reports 

without fear of reprisal. No incidents of 

discrimination came to our attention 

during the reporting period. 

In 2018, our governance bodies consisted of 

eight individuals, all of whom are male. 5 are 

between 30-50 years old, while 3 are above  

50 years old.

Talent Attraction and Employee Retention

We recognise that a conducive work 

environment, development opportunities, 

and a fair and competitive remuneration 

package contributes significantly to the 

satisfaction and reputation of a workplace. 

In the labour-intensive mining industry 

in rural Indonesia, we place a strong 

emphasis on building a workplace culture 

where our employees feel safe, cared for, 

and are respected. 

We strive to hire locally where possible to 

enhance the local employment landscape 

and provide opportunities to communities 

where we operate. We support a number of 

local education and training programmes 

with the aim of creating a stronger local 

workforce, which is then better positioned 

to tap into the opportunities that our 

operations create.

Our new hire and turnover data illustrate

In 2018, we hired 35 (2017: 33) new 

employees, with an 18% (2017: 18%) new 

hire rate for the reporting period. As we 

believe that a diverse team will bring 

enriching perspectives to the workplace, 

our new hires are from diverse genders 

and age groups, including new hires above 

age 50. 

During 2018, we recorded a total turnover 

of 24 (2017: 17) resulting in a 12% (2017: 

9%) turnover rate. This is a slight increase 

from 2017. As part of our efforts to 

attract talent and retain employees we 

are providing gym facilities to all our 

employees at the Jakarta office and the site 

offices, as well as a fitness club entitlement 

to all colleagues in our Singapore office.

People Development

Our people form the foundation of our 

organisation and drives the growth of 

our business. It is therefore critical for us 

to develop and maintain the best talent 

pool. We have allocated training budget 

to support the development and career 

aspirations of our employees. 

In 2018, each employee has benefitted 

from an average of 2.56 hours (2017: 6.80 

hours), with a breakdown of 2.64 hours 

for our male employees and 2.32 for our 

female employees. Our employees attend 

training on an ad-hoc basis, as and when 

it is required and relevant to individuals’ 

scope of work. We do not have a fixed 

training scheduled for our people. 

Our directors attended the following 

seminars and training programmes in 2018:

- seminar provided by the external 

auditors, Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP, to 

the Audit Committee on Financial 

Reporting Standards; 

- audit committee seminar organised by 

the Singapore Institute of Directors 

(SID) on “Rebooting Corporate 

Governance” which highlighted the 

latest developments on the SID’s 

Code of Governance, new accounting 

standards and convergence to the

Health and Safety

Health and safety forms the core of our 

business. We are committed to continuous 

improvements in the health and safety 

standards of our operations and the 

communities in which we operate. We are 

constantly working towards minimising 

risk of accidents, injuries and illnesses to 

our employees, contractors and the local 

community in which we operate. As part 

of our Safety Rewards Programme, all 

employees are participating in weekly and 

monthly safety talk programmes. This 

programme has broadened the insight of all 

employees into the importance of health, 

safety, work and environmental concerns and 

helped to achieve greater engagement of all 

employees with safe work procedures and 

our SHE rules. 

We adopt a comprehensive safety 

management system for our mining 

operations, which includes safety and 

environmental management plans, rules, 

codes of practice, manuals and procedures in 

line with international management systems 

OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001, which our 

employees are required to comply with.

To familiarise our workforce with our health 

and safety rules, regular safety drills are 

incorporated into our Group’s fundamental 

safety procedures and are carried out on 

a weekly basis with full participation of 

all onsite employees. We aim to inculcate 

an understanding of safety culture and 

procedures in our workplace. The training 

conducted is focused on developing the 

safety skills of our workforce, including 

contract workers. Internal safety checks are 

conducted weekly to ensure compliance by 

all our contract staff. 

We station safety officers at each of our 

mining sites to monitor work procedures of 

all employees, including those of our strategic 

partner, BUMA, to ensure strict adherence 

HEALTH AND SAFETY FORMS THE CORE OF OUR BUSINESS

HEALTH AND SAFETY



with our safety protocols and to identify 

shortfalls in our health and safety procedures. 

When any such shortfalls are identified, 

we introduce mitigation measures, amend 

our SOPs or introduce new policies and 

work instructions if required, to eliminate 

these risks. Where relevant, we follow 

internationally recognised benchmark 

frameworks, such as OHSAS 18001. 

Our strong emphasis on safety first and the 

health of our workers has resulted in a very 

low occurrence of accidents at our mines. All 

our employees have targets to achieve zero 

injuries and fatalities amongst our workforce. 

Based on our internal safety and health 

records, we are pleased to report that there 

were no major injuries or fatalities in 2018. 

Health and Safety Management Systems 

Our subsidiaries, SDJ and TBR are 

responsible for and committed to the 

sustainable and integrated management of 

health, safety and environment concerns at 

all stages of mining operations to control the 

risks and impacts of mining activities. They 

are committed to the creation of a safe and 

comfortable working environment, where 

all employees can perform their obligations 

without the risk of injury, occupational illness 

and where the impact on the environment is 

reduced to a minimum. Additionally, both 

SDJ and TBR are compliant with government 

legislation and supports the development 

of controls for safety, occupational health 

and the environment as well as post-mining 

rehabilitation to provide safe and productive 

conditions in accordance with prevailing 

laws and regulations. We seek to maintain 

zero injuries, accidents and negative 

environmental impacts. We are pleased to 

report that there were no incidents of serious 

injuries during the reporting period. 

These subsidiaries ensure that the 

Occupational Safety, Health and 

Environment policy is understood and

implemented by all levels of management, 

employees and contractors. Safety training is 

mandatory as prescribed by the government 

and implemented at the manager level at each 

site. Daily rehearsals are conducted to ensure 

that all employees are reminded of our safety 

culture and procedures. 

Our subsidiaries have other important roles 

relating to managing health and safety impacts 

such as the environmental rehabilitation of 

mines at the end of mining. Land is reclaimed 

by depositing the overburden removed as part 

of current mining activities onto mined out 

areas. Rehabilitation of the reclaimed land is 

then carried out by the spreading of topsoil 

onto the surface of the overburden deposition 

and the planting of native plants. Working in 

cooperation with our main mining contractor, 

BUMA, SDJ and TBR oversee the handling of 

land reclamation and rehabilitation by BUMA 

and is then itself responsible for revegetation of 

the reclaimed land. 

Our subsidiaries’ roles also include 

building and maintaining a harmonious 

relationship with the community in the 

process of preparation, execution, control, 

and rehabilitation of mine sites by active 

community engagement. 

We seek to maintain zero 

injuries, accidents and 

negative environmental 

impacts



Our commitment includes the prevention of 

accidents that result in injuries, prevention 

of property damage as a result of an incident, 

‘near-misses’ or poor maintenance. The 

management of Geo Energy is committed 

to providing excellence through strategic 

partnering and community engagement 

delivered by a competent team. To support 

our commitment, we are working closely 

with BUMA in implementing our safety 

management system. Apart from complying 

with all relevant government regulations, 

BUMA’s SHE policy consists of JOSHE (Joint 

Observation Safety Health and Environment), 

ZIAP (Zero Incident Awareness Programme), 

and a daily 5 minutes safety meeting before 

the start of operations (P5M). 

To ensure that the management plans and 

SOPs are implemented, we provide training 

for our entire workforce, including our 

subsidiaries, contractors and employees from 

local communities. 

This includes safety inductions (especially 

for new employees) and education on our 

SOPs and relevant safety and environment 

regulations. 

We carry out safety drills from time to time 

to ensure that procedures are understood, 

implemented and a safety culture is instilled 

in our operations. Regular trainings 

are conducted on basic safety skills and 

procedures for our workforce, including 

those employed from the local community. 

To gauge the effectiveness of our 

management systems, we commission 

internal audits by PwC Singapore and 

conduct joint safety checks with our 

strategic partner, BUMA to ensure 

compliance by our staff and contract 

workers and to confirm that our safety 

management plans are being implemented 

across all our mines and operations.

HEALTH AND SAFETY

mining contractor, we regularly carry out 

fogging activities at the surrounding areas 

of mine site to prevent the breeding of 

mosquitoes which may otherwise cause a 

number of diseases. 

We are pleased to report that during the 

reporting period we did not record any 

cases of occupational disease. There were no 

workers with high incidence or high risk of 

diseases related to their occupation. 

Worker Injury Compensation

Geo Energy provides additional Work 

Injury Compensation coverage for all 

employees, regardless of whether they are 

classified as miners or as otherwise defined 

in the Employment Act. This coverage 

is to compensate workers for the loss of 

earning capacity resulting from injury or 

occupational disease arising out of and 

in the course of working at our mines. 

The coverage does not extend to injuries 

sustained or disease contracted whilst not 

at the mine during a regular work day. 

If the injury or disease results in death, 

compensation is payable to the dependants 

of the worker. 

Any occupational injury sustained at work 

is required to be immediately reported 

to Human Resources, and depending 

upon whether the worker is classified as a 

workman or otherwise, in addition to the 

remedies available for the injury, it may 

fall within the purview of the Work Injury 

Compensation or be considered under 

common regulations, i.e. Indonesian law. 

Health and Safety for the Local 

Community 

Some of the ways in which we ensure the 

health and safety of local communities 

during the dry months includes spraying 

sections of coal haulage roads (which 

are largely dirt roads or earth roads) by 

deploying water trucks located near the 

homes of the local communities in order to 

reduce dust pollution. Face masks are also 

distributed to local residents to help reduce 

their exposure to dust. 



We focus on 

reducing our 

employees’ 

morbidity 

and sickness 

absenteeism rates

Other measures include: 

• Employing local workers and providing 

the workers with relevant training and 

opportunities for skills development. 

• Our community assistance efforts 

include making donations in kind to 

local schools (including providing 

building materials to build/repair school 

premises) as well as supporting any social 

or religious events of the communities. 

• Lastly, we regularly make donations such 

as sarongs for children in local schools 

and orphanages or basic necessities, 

such as rice, eggs, cooking oil and sugar, 

among other things.

OUR COMMUNITY IMPACT

There are altogether ten villages in the 

area around our active mines and good 

community relations are as vital for 

our business success as the effective 

management of our operations. Engaging 

with the communities in which we operate, 

our primary concern is to help the villagers 

around our mining sites with their most 

pressing day-to-day issues. Our local CSR 

teams regularly engage with the village 

heads, enquire with them on what their 

problems are and what we can do to help. 

All of Geo Energy’s operations as well 

as those of our mining partner BUMA 

have implemented local community 

engagement, impact assessments, and/

or development programmes. We believe 

in creating a positive and lasting social 

impact on the communities in the 

areas we operate in. As we continue to 

care for the local communities, we are 

able to develop successful partnerships 

based on mutual understanding, trust 

and respect. Together, we work hand in 

hand to identify and evaluate the needs 

of the community as well as the actual 

and potential social consequences of our 

operations at every stage of the mine’s 

life cycle. This allows us to focus our 

CSR efforts on improving the livelihood 

of these communities, in addition to 

protecting the environment around 

the mining sites, as described in the 

Environment section below. 

We actively engage 

with our stakeholders 

and the communities 

in which we operate to 

identify their needs

Our Community 

Impact

CSR Orgchart: 

SDJ, TBR &amp; BUMA

Community involvement is also the 

cornerstone of our employment policy 

at our mines. We seek to support and 

promote local businesses and economic 

activities by continuously engaging them 

as suppliers. We currently mainly procure 

food from local suppliers around our mine 

sites. We are looking at ways to formalise 

this approach in our employment and 

procurement policies. 

In all our community activities we strive 

to maximise the effects of our CSR efforts 

for the greatest possible number of people, 

and as such will seek to fund projects and 

initiatives that have a large number of 

beneficiaries.

In addition to the economic empowerment 

we are providing through local job 

creation, we are committed to improving 

and raising the overall living standards of 

the local communities. Together with the 

project managers on-site, Geo Energy staff 

tasked with community development invest 

time and effort in building these important 

relationships with local residents. Through 

regular engagements, we are able to identify 

the needs of the local communities and 

partner with them to address those needs 

where feasible. Regular meetings are held 

with representatives of each village to 

discuss the progress and implementation 

of our community assistance plans as 

well as to address any issues, concerns 

or complaints that may have arisen. In 

these conversations, it is very important to 

consider the priorities of the local village 

heads as well as the ‘Bupati’ or regent of the 

district. To ensure a good alignment with 

local requirements and maximum effect of 

our Community Investment Programmes, 

we will usually aim to conclude agreements 

between Geo Energy, BUMA, and the local 

authority  

(if necessary). 

Our close collaboration with BUMA on our 

CSR Programmes is also reflected in our

Community Investment Programmes

Our CSR investment programme in the 

vicinity of our mines rests on  

four pillars:

- Education &amp; Knowledge

- Health &amp; Nutrition

- Social Culture &amp; Religion

- Infrastructure &amp; Development 

During 2018, in close cooperation with 

our mining partner BUMA, our joint 

community investments in Indonesia 

amounted to approximately IDR 7.9 billion, 

(equivalent to approximately US$ 560,000). 

In 2018, we are proud to have made the 

following contributions to the well-being of 

the communities that live in the ten villages 

located in close proximity to mines: 

We are committed to continue our 

community investments for 2019. Together 

with BUMA, we have jointly budgeted 

IDR 7,500,000,000 for various projects 

and are looking forward to reporting 

on our progress in Geo Energy’s next 

Sustainability Report. 

Community Outreach Programmes

Apart from our investment programmes, 

we also engage with local communities in 

other ways. 

Examples of our community outreach 

programmes include: 

• As part of our ongoing CSR efforts, our 

Singapore team and Jakarta colleagues 

participated in the Run for Hope 2018 

and 2019. Geo Energy was a platinum 

sponsor of this charity run which was 

organised by the National Cancer 

Centre in collaboration with various 

organisations to raise awareness and 

support for cancer research. We also 

encouraged our employees’ family 

members to join the run as a bonding 

opportunity.

• In cooperation with the Singapore 

Institute of Technology we have 

established the Geo Energy Bursary to 

provide financial assistance to deserving 

and financially disadvantaged students 

enrolled in the Institute. The financial 

contribution amounts to S$60,000 to 

be disbursed over a period of four years 

commencing from Academic Year 2018.

ENVIRONMENT

Since the commencement of our 

operations, Geo Energy has been 

committed to achieving high standards 

of environmental management at the 

mines where we operate. This encompasses 

meeting local and international standards 

for mining operations, being efficient 

in our use of energy, preventing and 

mitigating water pollution, and managing 

waste properly. Geo Energy recognizes 

that effectively managing environmental 

impacts is imperative in the mining 

industry. We are aware of the fact that our 

operations have environmental impacts 

and it is our responsibility to manage these 

impacts. 

A cornerstone of our environmental 

mitigation strategy is that our coal 

reserves are strategically located 

underneath a palm oil plantation and 

we have entered into an agreement with 

the plantation owner to borrow, use, and 

return the land upon completion of our 

mining activities. Under the terms of 

the agreement, the plantation owner will 

resume use of the land for cultivation of 

palm oil trees. We are thus minimising 

our impact on the natural environment 

while at the same time lowering 

the expected costs required for the 

reforestation of exploited mining sites. 

We focus on avoiding and preventing 

negative impacts where possible, 

otherwise mitigating and remediating 

these environmental effects as much as 

we can. Environmental stewardship and 

management is very important to our 

relationships with local communities, 

regulators and other external stakeholders. 

We consider environmental management 

to be an important part of overall 

good governance. Our environmental 

management strategies and goals include 

effective air and water pollution control 

measures, proper handling and disposal 

of hazardous and poisonous waste, and 

Environment

COMMITTED TO ACHIEVE HIGH STANDARDS OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

continuous improvements of our resource 

efficiency. We work in accordance with 

our SHE policy and aim to improve our 

environmental performance over time. 

Environmental Compliance 

The Environmental Control Agency (Badan 

Lingkungan Hidup Daerah) (BLHD) is 

the government agency responsible for 

implementing environmental regulations 

and policies. BLHD coordinates its 

activities with various government 

agencies, including the Ministry of Energy 

and Mineral Resources. In accordance with 

local regulatory requirements, our mining 

operations undergo periodic internal and 

external environmental audits. The Geo 

Energy environmental team conducts 

internal environmental audits, while BLHD 

conducts external audits. Together we work 

to improve our procedures and ensure 

that our Group adheres to the prescribed 

policies. 

During our mining operations, we review 

the emissions of our operations and 

apply appropriate environmental quality 

standards in accordance with regulatory 

requirements. In addition, we also monitor 

particulate, gas, and vapour exposure in the 

workplace, in line with our occupational 

health standards. 

In 2018, we did not receive any formal 

complaints relating to environmental 

pollution against our Group and Geo 

Energy had zero cases of non-compliance 

with environmental laws and regulations.  

Energy Efficiency and Climate Change

Geo Energy is committed to achieving high 

standards of environmental management at 

the mines where we operate. We recognise 

that our business is energy intensive 

and leads to greenhouse gas (GHG) 

emissions. We are mitigating these impacts 

by reducing our energy usage and our 

greenhouse gas emissions where possible. 

Climate change directly and indirectly 

affects Geo Energy’s business. The biggest 

challenges to our current operations 

caused by climate change so far are 

changing weather patterns, in particular 

precipitation. Unpredictable high 

rainfall makes the roads in our mining 

area slippery and may increase the risk 

of accidents. We actively monitor the 

weather in our operations to ensure that 

our workers do not perform risky work in 

the mining area during heavy rain. 

We are tracking the consumption of 

non-renewable fuel sources and electricity 

within the mining area. We reduce our 

energy consumption by reducing the use of 

lamps, air conditioners and fans whenever 

our workers are not in the room, stopping 

the engines of trucks when parked or 

otherwise using energy saving equipment 

to reduce the fuel consumption of engines. 

Our SDJ and TBR mines used a combined 

50,379,104 litres of diesel and 3,862 kWh of 

electricity in 2018, amounting to a total of 

1,819,707 GJ of energy used5. There were no 

renewable sources of fuel used and no sale 

of energy in 2018.

The energy intensity of our SDJ mine 

decreased by 6.4% from 0.25 GJ/man-hour 

worked in 2017 to 0.24 GJ/man-hour 

worked in 2018, while our TBR mine 

recorded an energy intensity of 0.30 GJ/

man-hour worked in 2018. This includes 

diesel and electricity consumed in both 

mines.

Water 

Water is a vital resource and one that has 

high economic, environmental and social 

value. It represents a basic human right 

for communities. As part of our mining 

operations, we use water (e.g. for the 

watering of roads, to prevent the formation 

of dust clouds). Water from the mine is 

deposited through mine water drainage.

Our SDJ and TBR mines consumed a 

total of 71,591m3 of water in 2018, with a 

breakdown of 40,350m3 from municipal 

water sources and 31,241m3 from 

groundwater. 

The water consumption intensity of our 

SDJ mine increased by 451.6% from 1.82m3/

thousand man-hours worked in 2017 to 10.05 

m3/thousand man-hours worked in 2018. 

Our TBR mine recorded water consumption 

intensity of 10.57 m3/thousand man-hours 

worked in 2018. During 2018, no water 

sources were significantly affected by Geo 

Energy’s withdrawal of water.

Effluents and Waste

At Geo Energy, we strive to ensure that 

all standards, procedures and regulations 

relating to waste are implemented and 

consistently adhered to as this is an 

important issue for us. We take measures 

to ensure all employees are aware of 

all new and revised waste regulations 

via regular training and information 

sharing sessions. All employees in charge 

of hazardous and toxic waste materials 

are made aware of the procedures and 

regulations relating to the waste. We 

ensure the availability of equipment for 

waste management and control. 

Solid Waste 

Waste such as used oil, scrap metal and 

worn tyres are brought to designated 

dump sites at the mines to be collected 

and removed by third party contractors 

periodically. Batteries and solutions are 

collected and stored in sealed containers, in 

accordance with the international Material 

Safety Data Sheet (MSDS).

The appropriate waste disposal method is 

determined by waste disposal contractors 

at their discretion.

Wastewater

Stringent testing and removal of oil and 

other pollutants, testing of acidity levels 

and treatment is carried out before the 

disposal of wastewater. We ensure that 

we conduct adequate wastewater testing. 

Water with a pH below 6 is treated until it 

is in accordance with the standard value 

of quality. 

In 2018, our mines discharged 39,036 m3 

from our settling ponds, with an average 

BOD of 0.016 mg/l, significantly below 

the local government regulation limits 

for BOD. There were no water discharges 

in 2017 as all our wastewater was being 

treated in our settling ponds.

In 2018, we had zero incidences of BOD of 

wastewater exceeding local government 

regulation limits and had no spill incidents 

leading to impacts on human health, land, 

vegetation, water bodies and groundwater. 

Hazardous Waste 

All hazardous wastes are disposed of and 

handled in accordance with applicable laws 

and regulations. 

Some hazardous and toxic waste materials 

that are used are oil, lead, asbestos, 

laboratory waste, fly ash and ash base 

with concentrations above the threshold 

value, solvents and paints, acids / bases, 

batteries, and pesticides. Some of these 

hazardous waste materials can be 

explosive, flammable, toxic, reactive, can 

cause irritation if exposed to the body 

and can be corrosive, carcinogenic or 

mutagenic in nature. Employees who 

are responsible for handling hazardous 

waste are equipped with appropriate and 

adequate personal protective equipment to 

handle hazardous waste. 

Like the different streams of waste, 

ammonium nitrate has a specific sewage 

disposal system and MSDS instructions are 

strictly followed by the personnel handling 

these chemicals. To meet the requirements 

for the disposal of hazardous waste, 

waste is collected by official contractors 

approved by the local Environmental 

Department (Dinas Lingkungan Hidup) 

and Local Government to dispose waste in 

accordance with the established Standard 

Operating Procedures (SOPs). 

We recorded a total of 809.76 tonnes of 

hazardous waste in 2018, with a breakdown 

of 472.20 tonnes and 337.56 tonnes from 

the SDJ and TBR mines respectively. All 

809.76 tonnes of this hazardous waste was 

stored for a maximum of one week at a 

temporary site within our concession and 

near our mines. All our hazardous waste 

are then handled and disposed by our 

appointed authorised contractors.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 

Non-Hazardous Waste 

Waste management is one of the obligations 

outsourced to BUMA. Geo Energy ensures 

that BUMA follows the agreed SHE policy 

at all times. Nonhazardous and non-toxic 

waste that is generated as a product of our 

operations is rubber, plastic, paper, wood, 

wrapping, kitchen waste, glass and other 

light waste which is typically disposed of in 

a landfill by approved waste contractors. 

All waste disposal sites at our mine sites are 

recorded in the mine plan and approved 

in writing by senior management. The 

Chairman of the Keselamatan Kesihatan 

Kerja Lingkungan Hidup (Health &amp; Safety 

Environment Committee, K3LH) and all 

department heads ensure the availability 

of adequate waste bins complete with 

appropriate color codes and labels in all 

work areas under their responsibility. Waste 

rubber, paper, and plastics are separated in 

special waste bins to accommodate different 

plastic, paper and rubber waste, and shipped 

/ resold to companies that can recycle 

these materials. Metal waste (aluminium, 

steel, iron, copper) is not categorised as 

hazardous waste, unless the waste metal is 

contaminated by hazardous materials, and is 

typically sent for recycling. 

We recorded a total of 24.35 tonnes of 

non-hazardous waste in 2018, with a 

breakdown of 13.40 tonnes and 10.95 

tonnes from the SDJ and TBR mines 

respectively. All 24.35 tonnes of our 

non-hazardous waste were sent to landfills. 

Biodiversity 

Biodiversity and its associated ecosystem 

services are fundamental to maintaining 

the provision of food and water for society. 

During 2018, our operations have had 

minor impacts on biodiversity in the areas 

in which we operate. Species of plants in 

the form of scrubs are lost in the mining 

area. The area will be replanted with scrubs 

after mining and reclamation. It will take 

1-2 years to fully restore the area. 

We are pleased to report, however, that 

due to our mine being located within an 

active palm oil plantation, no sites of high 

biodiversity value or protected areas were 

affected by our mining operations during 

the reporting period. We have conducted 

Environmental Impact Assessments 

(‘AMDAL’) for our mining operations and 

have Environmental Monitoring (‘UPL’) 

in place. 

Together with our business partner 

BUMA, we have formulated comprehensive 

post-mining reclamation and rehabilitation 

plans to manage the natural environment 

and our impacts on it while we carry out our 

mining operations. These plans take into 

consideration the geological characteristics 

of our mining sites in order to better manage 

the environment. It is our Group’s plan to 

rehabilitate land as soon as it is no longer 

mined rather than wait until the end of mine 

life. Land reclamation activities involve the 

deposition of the overburden, the material 

that lies above an area such as the rock, soil, 

and plantation ecosystem that lies above a 

coal seam or ore body in mined-out areas. 

While rehabilitation activities involve the 

spreading of topsoil over the surface of the 

overburden deposited and the planting of 

palm tree seedlings to restore the original 

environment of the parts of the palm oil 

plantation that were temporarily displaced 

by our mining operations. 

We are pleased to report that as part of our 

Reclamation Plan for the period from 2016 

to 2020, the total land area returned to 

productive plantation use at our SDJ mine in 

2018 was 50 hectares (2017: 44.95 hectares), 

representing an increase of more than 11% 

from 2017. To protect and enrich the soill, 

a cover crop was planted on the entire 

reclaimed area, thus managing soil erosion 

and soil quality.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 

ABOUT GEO ENERGY RESOURCES LIMITED  

(Bloomberg Ticker: GERL SP)

Geo Energy Resources Limited (collectively with its 

subsidiaries ‘Geo Energy’ or the ‘Group’), established since 

2008, is one of the major coal producers in Indonesia, with 

offices in Singapore and Jakarta, Indonesia and production 

operations in Kalimantan, Indonesia. Geo Energy is listed on 

the Singapore Stock Exchange and is part of the Singapore 

FTSE ST Index. The Group was ranked 17th in the inaugural 

award for Singapore’s Fastest Growing Companies 2019 

presented by The Straits Times and Statista based on the 

strongest revenue growth in recent years, and the Group was 

ranked 35th in the Corporate Governance and Transparency 

Index 2018, placed amongst the top listed companies.

Geo Energy owns four mining concessions through its wholly-

owned subsidiaries with JORC coal reserves1 of over 80 

million tonnes and working in collaboration with world-class 

business partners such as BUMA, ECTP and Macquarie. 

Growing coal reserves through strategic acquisitions is core 

to Geo Energy’s strategy.

The focus of our coal sales remains on Indonesia and China 

as core markets. The Group has also scaled up its presence 

in other markets such as Thailand, India and the Philippines 

and will use this as a strategic vantage point as we ramp 

up coal production in our TBR mine. As part of the strategic 

partnership agreement with Macquarie Bank Limited 

(“Macquarie”), finalised in November 2018, Macquarie made 

a 5% equity investment in Geo Energy. This agreement also 

allowed us to ramp up production at our TBR mine to full 

capacity. Other than that, there were no significant changes to 

our share capital structure, our operations and our locations, 

nor to our supply chain during the reporting period.
