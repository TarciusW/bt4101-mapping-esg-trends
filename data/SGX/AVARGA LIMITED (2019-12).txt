SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019
Message from the Board
Dear Stakeholders.
On behalf of the Board, I am proud to present our third Sustainability Report ("SR") of Avarga
Limited ("Avarga" and together with its subsidiaries, the "Group"), covering the Financial Year
ended 31 December 2019 ("FY 2019"). This report highlights our growth and our effort in
managing the Group's Environmental, Social and Governance ("EsG") performance for
FY 2019.
We believe that our business and action have an impact on our stakeholders and that building
a sustainable business is vital to our continuous growth and success. As we recognise the
importance of sustainability, we thrive to achieve long-term benefits and sustainability in
every aspect of our business operations. At the same time, we continue to contribute to our
community, protect our environment and ensure that sustainable practices are incorporated
into our business operations.
We have business operations that span across Malaysia, Myanmar, Canada and the USA.
Our three core businesses are paper manufacturing, power generation and building materials
distribution. With an employment of more than 700 staff and strong revenue streams from
our core businesses, we believe that Avarga is well-positioned to build a sustainable business
together with the support of our stakeholders.
Our sustainability efforts are led by our senior management and monitored by our Board
As we grow our business, we will continue to enhance our sustainability efforts and work
towards aligning our policies and practices with established economic, environmental and
social standards and initiatives.

Organization Profile
Avarga Limited ("Avarga" and together with its subsidiaries, the "Group") is an established
investment holding company that specialises in the optimisation of return of equities through
building sustainable value to our shareholders. We build business models that are long-term,
focusing on competitive advantages, good management and innovation.
Headquartered in Singapore and listed on the mainboard of the Singapore Exchange ("sGx")
since 1980, we have three core businesses and operate in five countries. These businesses
generate sustainable cash flows, progressively diverting into other investments. Our three
main businesses are as follow:
Paper Manufacturing (Malaysia)
UPP Pulp & Paper (M) Sdn Bhd is an upstream paper mill, producing almost 10%
 of Malaysia's domestic output of brown packaging paper. We produce
industrial grade papers such as testliner, corrugating medium and coreboard,
which are used in the manufacture of corrugated carton boxes. Located in ljok,
Selangor, our paper mill is capable of producting up to 90,000 tonnes of paper
per year. 0ur paper mill was awarded the IS0 90012015 Certification by
ISOQAR Ltd in 2015
Power Generation (Myanmar)
UPP Power (Myanmar) Limited is one of Myanmar's first fully foreign-owned
independent power producers and accounts for almost 2% of the country's
Iocal total power generation. Located in Insein township, Yangon, our 50MW
gas-fired power plant is contracted to sell a minimum of 350 million kilowatt
hours (kWh) per year for a duration of 30 years, until Feb 2044, to the
Myanmar Government.
Building Materials Distribution (Taiga, Canada)
Taiga Building Products Ltd ("Taiga") is Canada's largest wholesale distributor of
building materials, such as lumber, panels, moulding, sidings, engineering wood
flooring and many others. Taiga has wood preservation plants and distribution
centres across Canada, as well as distribution centres and reload stations in the
USA. In 2018, Taiga acquired Exterior Wood Inc, based in Washington, USA,
which enabled it to further extend its reach into the USA. Taiga also undertakes
exports.

Supply Chain Management
We are fully committed to deliver products and services that are of the highest
quality. The Group follows strict procedures in identifying, selecting and
monitoring suppliers. We aim to only source from ethical, responsible and cost-
effective suppliers and minimise potential disruptions in the supply chain.
Machinery parts and scrap materials used for our paper mill in Malaysia are
sourced extensively to ensure they help to boost efficiency in brown paper
production. We also evaluate and monitor our raw material suppliers, to ensure
they provide us quality scrap paper with lower levels of impurities.
Highly energy efficient generators are used in our power plant in Myanmar, to ensure efficient
gas utilisation.
Taiga, our building materials distribution business in Canada and USA, has an extensive
network of suppliers, given the wide range of products we carry and the scale
of our operations. Taiga is relatively resilient in growth and revenue due to our
strategic management planning, which includes growing market share, addition
of more products into our distribution channel, more proactive trading and
expansion of exports.
Moving forward, we will continue to strengthen our network of suppliers and procurement
processes. We will build strong and lasting relationships with our key suppliers, and evaluate
ways to better manage our suppliers, supply chain, logistics and resources.

AVARGA LIMITED
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019
External Initiatives
The Group believes in contributing towards driving positive and sustainable changes for the
benefit of the local communities where we operate, and society as a whole. This is the
underlying vision behind our Corporate Social Responsibility ("csR") activities.
Our CSR efforts are mainly focused in Myanmar, where we see room for improvement in living
and education standards. We have also made CSR contributions in Malaysia and Singapore.
In Myanmar, we have identified a government primary school near our power plant in Yangon,
No. 16 Basic Education Primary School, Ywama, Insein township, where we have continuously
helped to improve the school's condition and provide a more conducive learning environment
for the students.
We started our initiatives in 2015 by
replacing two-thirds of the school's old
furniture with new desks and chairs. This
had helped the school to accommodate
more students. In 2016, we continued our
initiative by spending US$50,000 to
construct a new 900 sq. ft. air-conditioned
multi-media hall, and equipped it with
31 sets of new computers, accessories, desks and chairs. This had helped to equip the pupils
with better computer and literacy skills.
In 2018, we built a school hall and meal area for the students. We also donated a set of
uniform, books and a school bag to each of the 830 students of the school. We are pleased to
report that in 2019, we constructed a new 605 ft. length concrete school perimeter wall
contributed towards the establishment and furnishing of the school library and donated a set
of school uniforms and books for each of the school's 887 students.
Another government school that we identified was No. 149 Basic Education Primary School in
Kanuatgyi Village, Kanma Township, Magway Region. In 2018, we constructed a new
2,700 sq ft school building and donated a set of uniform, books and a school bag to each of
the school's 203 students.
To support and promote Singapore's arts and cultural heritage, we have pledged to donate a
total of S$250,000 to the Singapore National Gallery. This comprises a donation of S$50,000
per year, over five years from 2018 to 2022. To date, S$100,000 was donated in 2018 and
2019, with the balance of S$150,000 due in 2020-2022.
In Malaysia, we donated RM30,000 in 2019 to Persatuan Kebajikan Amal Da Ai Malaysia,
a non-profit charitable childcare centre looking after mentally and physically handicapped
children on a full-time, lived in basis.

Corporate Governance and Sustainability Approach
The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Avarga is committed to
maintaining good corporate governance to enhance and
safeguard the interest of its stakeholders. Avarga has adopted
a framework of corporate governance policies and practices in
line with the principles and guidelines set out in the Code of
Corporate Governance 2018. To effectively implement our
sustainability approach and demonstrate accountability to our
stakeholders, employees of Avarga follow strictly to the Code of
Conduct Policy and the Whistleblowing Policy.
The Code of Conduct Policy sets out the principles and standards of
behaviour to guide employees in carrying out their duties and responsibilities. It also reminds
employees to comply with reporting and disclosure requirements of potential or actual
conflicts of interest. The Group has established procedures to ensure that all transactions
with interested persons are reported in a timely manner to the Audit Committee and that
such transactions are reviewed and approved by senior executives, the Audit Committee
and/or the Board, as the case may be, based on the transaction amount and whether they
had been conducted on an arm's length basis in accordance with prescribed procedures.
When a potential conflict of interest arises, the Director concerned will not participate in
discussions and will abstain from voting on such transaction.
Avarga is committed to a high standard of compliance with
accounting, financial reporting, internal controls, corporate
governance and auditing requirements. The Whistleblowing
Policy was established for employees and external parties to
raise concerns and offer reassurance that they will be
protected from reprisals or victimisation for whistle blowing in
good faith.

Economic Performance
The Group's revenue for FY 2019 was S$1.4 billion, compared to S$1.6 billion in FY 2018, the
decline was mainly due to the lower lumber prices. Overall gross profit increased by S$4.7
million or 3%. The Group's net profit after tax and non-controlling interests increased to
S$32.6 million from S$11.2 million in the corresponding period last year, partly due to a
one-off gain of S$10.9 million from the disposal of our property at Tuas, Singapore.

Economic Performance (Cont'd)
Avarga strives to deliver sustainable earnings and create long-term value for our stakeholders.
We achieve this through maintaining significant positioning in our respective core markets.
As an investment holding company, we also look for investment opportunities where we can
add and create value.
We have invested heavily in our entities in Malaysia, Myanmar, Canada and USA. We make
continuous investments to increase efficiency, product quality, customer experiences and
market reach. This is to ensure we firmly plant ourselves as significant players in our
respective businesses.
At Taiga, we are increasing the use of information technology to track our inventory and
suppliers. We are also actively sourcing for new vendors and product lines for building
materials, to expand our product range and revenue streams.
Taiga acquired US-based Exterior Wood Inc for US$42 million in 2018, which has significantly
expanded our market presence in the USA. Exterior Wood has a wood treatment plant and
distribution centre in Washougal, Washington. Leveraging on Taiga's existing large product
and vendor base, we have since significantly expanded our sales and product offerings in the
US market using Exterior Wood.
 In 2019, we invested substantially in the regularly scheduled major overhauls of our Myanmar
power plant. Ten of the thirteen machines were overhauled and another three were due for
overhaul maintenance by mid-2020. These overhauls took up the bulk of cashflows generated
from the power plant last year and will improve the plant's efficiency going forward.
We also make continuous investments in machinery parts to upgrade our paper
manufacturing plant in Malaysia.
Going forward, we will continue to focus on improving our three core businesses, as well as
seek new opportunities. We aim to generate sustainable earnings and create value for our
shareholders and stakeholders.

Anti-Corruption
To protect the interests of our stakeholders and

We believe that good corporate governance establishes and maintains an ethical
environment within the Group. Our employees observe a strict code of conduct relating to
conflict of interest, insider trading, fraud and proper accounting.
We also have a whistleblowing policy in place which encourages employees and stakeholders
to raise concerns in confidence, about possible irregularities. We have various channels for
both employees and external parties to raise their concerns and issues in good faith, including
to the heads of departments, management, the board of directors and the Audit Committee.
The Head of Audit Committee is also directly accessible via email.
We are pleased to note there were no instance of corruption related activities reported in

Employment
We believe in investing in our employees as they are our most valuable asset. We also believe
that a diversified and merit-based workforce with the right skills and mindsets uplifts the
quality of works, creates a positive working culture and environment, and increases
productivity.
Our Human Resource management policies are established based on fair employment
practices as part of our efforts to attract, develop and retain a motivated workforce. Also,
through the whistleblowing policy, we ensure that our employees work in a fair and just
environment.
We recruit talents using merit-based system and providing them a fair opportunity to
demonstrate their knowledge, skills and experience. We promote a healthy mix of age,
race and gender in the workplace, where possible.
We also foster a strong culture of collaboration and communication within the Group, to
create a healthy organizational culture that promotes transparency, teamwork and team
spirit.
To recognise, retain and develop talent in the workplace, employees go through annual
appraisals. This ensures that we are able to recognise and reward our employees' ability and
their contributions, and we can further develop their skills through trainings, promotions and
workshops.
For our 2019 Sustainability Report, we will be focusing on the employment statistics for UPP
Pulp & Paper (M) Sdn Bhd and Taiga Building Products Ltd. The workforce of our power plant
operations in Myanmar is largely outsourced through a long-term Operations & Maintenance
contract with Myan Shwe Pyi Tractors Ltd, the official dealer for Caterpillar in Myanmar.

existing employees for them to understand the rules and safety regulations to be adhered to.
In addition, the paper mill mandates that proper Personal Protective Equipment are worn by
the staff at all times when handling heavy equipment, operating machinery or chemicals.
We have established standards for reporting on accidents and injuries suffered by our

*Loss Day Rate is calculated as number of lost working days x 200,000 hours over total hours worked.
In FY 2019, there was a total of seven reported injuries for employees of the paper mill,
compared to six reported instances in FY 2018. The lost day rate increased from 54.70 to 95.84
for our Malaysian workers, and from 3.87 to 36.94 for our foreign workers. The increase in
the overall lost day rate was mainly attributed to one Malaysian employee (with a lost day

was unable to return to work for six months during FY 2019.

Environmental Compliance
The Group is sensitive to the environmental impact across our business operations. We are
conscious of the need to fully comply with all environmental rules and regulations by the
relevant authorities.
We constantly look for ways to improve our business processes and operations so as to reduce
negative impact on the environment. We also involve our supply chain partners in sustainable
practices through outlining our expectations in the vendor selection process as well as the
evaluation of their performance.
The paper mill operations are subjected to strict local council and federal environmental laws
particularly in relation to the discharge of waste and sludge. Where possible, we procure scrap
paper with lower levels of impurities from our pool of vendors, to reduce the amount of
excess unusable waste destined for disposal. Wastage and impurities are closely monitored
to determine the quality of supplies and our vendors.
Taiga is committed to operating its facilities in an environmentally responsible manner
Taiga's business activities are subjected to federal, state, provincial and local environmental
and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including requirements relating to
air emissions, storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous substances, wastewater and
storm water discharge, ownership and operation of underground storage tanks and cleanup
of contaminated soil and groundwater.
All three of Taiga's "Envirofor Preservers" treating plants have achieved the highest standard
in Canada by being certified by Wood Preservation Canada. "Taiga Exterior Wood" preserved
wood products are now covered by the Canadian Wood Pallet and Container Association.
Taiga's wood treating operations in the USA, under Exterior Wood Inc, have also complied
with all regulatory requirements.
In FY 2019, there were no significant fines or non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance
with environmental laws and regulations.

Organization Profile
Avarga Limited ("Avarga" and together with its subsidiaries, the "Group") is an established
investment holding company that specialises in the optimisation of return of equities through
building sustainable value to our shareholders. We build business models that are long-term,
focusing on competitive advantages, good management and innovation.
Headquartered in Singapore and listed on the mainboard of the Singapore Exchange ("sGx")
since 1980, we have three core businesses and operate in five countries. These businesses
generate sustainable cash flows, progressively diverting into other investments. Our three
main businesses are as follow:
Paper Manufacturing (Malaysia)
UPP Pulp & Paper (M) Sdn Bhd is an upstream paper mill, producing almost 10%
 of Malaysia's domestic output of brown packaging paper. We produce
industrial grade papers such as testliner, corrugating medium and coreboard,
which are used in the manufacture of corrugated carton boxes. Located in ljok,
Selangor, our paper mill is capable of producting up to 90,000 tonnes of paper
per year. 0ur paper mill was awarded the IS0 90012015 Certification by
ISOQAR Ltd in 2015
Power Generation (Myanmar)
UPP Power (Myanmar) Limited is one of Myanmar's first fully foreign-owned
independent power producers and accounts for almost 2% of the country's
Iocal total power generation. Located in Insein township, Yangon, our 50MW
gas-fired power plant is contracted to sell a minimum of 350 million kilowatt
hours (kWh) per year for a duration of 30 years, until Feb 2044, to the
Myanmar Government.
Building Materials Distribution (Taiga, Canada)
Taiga Building Products Ltd ("Taiga") is Canada's largest wholesale distributor of
building materials, such as lumber, panels, moulding, sidings, engineering wood
flooring and many others. Taiga has wood preservation plants and distribution
centres across Canada, as well as distribution centres and reload stations in the

which enabled it to further extend its reach into the USA. Taiga also undertakes
exports.

Supply Chain Management
We are fully committed to deliver products and services that are of the highest
quality. The Group follows strict procedures in identifying, selecting and
monitoring suppliers. We aim to only source from ethical, responsible and cost-
effective suppliers and minimise potential disruptions in the supply chain.
Machinery parts and scrap materials used for our paper mill in Malaysia are
sourced extensively to ensure they help to boost efficiency in brown paper
production. We also evaluate and monitor our raw material suppliers, to ensure
they provide us quality scrap paper with lower levels of impurities.
Highly energy efficient generators are used in our power plant in Myanmar, to ensure efficient
gas utilisation.
Taiga, our building materials distribution business in Canada and USA, has an extensive
network of suppliers, given the wide range of products we carry and the scale
of our operations. Taiga is relatively resilient in growth and revenue due to our
strategic management planning, which includes growing market share, addition
of more products into our distribution channel, more proactive trading and
expansion of exports.
Moving forward, we will continue to strengthen our network of suppliers and procurement
processes. We will build strong and lasting relationships with our key suppliers, and evaluate
ways to better manage our suppliers, supply chain, logistics and resources.

External Initiatives
The Group believes in contributing towards driving positive and sustainable changes for the
benefit of the local communities where we operate, and society as a whole. This is the
underlying vision behind our Corporate Social Responsibility ("csR") activities.
Our CSR efforts are mainly focused in Myanmar, where we see room for improvement in living
and education standards. We have also made CSR contributions in Malaysia and Singapore.
In Myanmar, we have identified a government primary school near our power plant in Yangon,
No. 16 Basic Education Primary School, Ywama, Insein township, where we have continuously
helped to improve the school's condition and provide a more conducive learning environment
for the students.
We started our initiatives in 2015 by
replacing two-thirds of the school's old
furniture with new desks and chairs. This
had helped the school to accommodate
more students. In 2016, we continued our
initiative by spending US$50,000 to
construct a new 900 sq. ft. air-conditioned
multi-media hall, and equipped it with
31 sets of new computers, accessories, desks and chairs. This had helped to equip the pupils
with better computer and literacy skills.
In 2018, we built a school hall and meal area for the students. We also donated a set of
uniform, books and a school bag to each of the 830 students of the school. We are pleased to
report that in 2019, we constructed a new 605 ft. length concrete school perimeter wall
contributed towards the establishment and furnishing of the school library and donated a set
of school uniforms and books for each of the school's 887 students.
Another government school that we identified was No. 149 Basic Education Primary School in
Kanuatgyi Village, Kanma Township, Magway Region. In 2018, we constructed a new
2,700 sq ft school building and donated a set of uniform, books and a school bag to each of
the school's 203 students.
To support and promote Singapore's arts and cultural heritage, we have pledged to donate a
total of S$250,000 to the Singapore National Gallery. This comprises a donation of S$50,000
per year, over five years from 2018 to 2022. To date, S$100,000 was donated in 2018 and
2019, with the balance of S$150,000 due in 2020-2022.
In Malaysia, we donated RM30,000 in 2019 to Persatuan Kebajikan Amal Da Ai Malaysia,
a non-profit charitable childcare centre looking after mentally and physically handicapped
children on a full-time, lived in basis.

The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Avarga is committed to
maintaining good corporate governance to enhance and
safeguard the interest of its stakeholders. Avarga has adopted
a framework of corporate governance policies and practices in
line with the principles and guidelines set out in the Code of
Corporate Governance 2018. To effectively implement our
sustainability approach and demonstrate accountability to our

Conduct Policy and the Whistleblowing Policy.
The Code of Conduct Policy sets out the principles and standards of
behaviour to guide employees in carrying out their duties and responsibilities. It also reminds
employees to comply with reporting and disclosure requirements of potential or actual
conflicts of interest. The Group has established procedures to ensure that all transactions
with interested persons are reported in a timely manner to the Audit Committee and that
such transactions are reviewed and approved by senior executives, the Audit Committee
and/or the Board, as the case may be, based on the transaction amount and whether they
had been conducted on an arm's length basis in accordance with prescribed procedures.
When a potential conflict of interest arises, the Director concerned will not participate in
discussions and will abstain from voting on such transaction.
Avarga is committed to a high standard of compliance with
accounting, financial reporting, internal controls, corporate
governance and auditing requirements. The Whistleblowing
Policy was established for employees and external parties to
raise concerns and offer reassurance that they will be
protected from reprisals or victimisation for whistle blowing in
good faith.

AVARGA LIMITED
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019
Economic Performance
The Group's revenue for FY 2019 was S$1.4 billion, compared to S$1.6 billion in FY 2018, the
decline was mainly due to the lower lumber prices. Overall gross profit increased by S$4.7
million or 3%. The Group's net profit after tax and non-controlling interests increased to
S$32.6 million from S$11.2 million in the corresponding period last year, partly due to a
one-off gain of S$10.9 million from the disposal of our property at Tuas, Singapore.

AVARGA LIMITED
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019
Economic Performance (Cont'd)
Avarga strives to deliver sustainable earnings and create long-term value for our stakeholders.
We achieve this through maintaining significant positioning in our respective core markets.
As an investment holding company, we also look for investment opportunities where we can
add and create value.
We have invested heavily in our entities in Malaysia, Myanmar, Canada and USA. We make
continuous investments to increase efficiency, product quality, customer experiences and
market reach. This is to ensure we firmly plant ourselves as significant players in our
respective businesses.
At Taiga, we are increasing the use of information technology to track our inventory and
suppliers. We are also actively sourcing for new vendors and product lines for building
materials, to expand our product range and revenue streams.
Taiga acquired US-based Exterior Wood Inc for US$42 million in 2018, which has significantly
expanded our market presence in the USA. Exterior Wood has a wood treatment plant and
distribution centre in Washougal, Washington. Leveraging on Taiga's existing large product
and vendor base, we have since significantly expanded our sales and product offerings in the
US market using Exterior Wood.
 In 2019, we invested substantially in the regularly scheduled major overhauls of our Myanmar
power plant. Ten of the thirteen machines were overhauled and another three were due for
overhaul maintenance by mid-2020. These overhauls took up the bulk of cashflows generated
from the power plant last year and will improve the plant's efficiency going forward.
We also make continuous investments in machinery parts to upgrade our paper
manufacturing plant in Malaysia.
Going forward, we will continue to focus on improving our three core businesses, as well as
seek new opportunities. We aim to generate sustainable earnings and create value for our
shareholders and stakeholders.
