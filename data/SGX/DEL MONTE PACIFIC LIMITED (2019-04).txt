Del Monte Pacific Limited (the Group or DMPL) is pleased to announce that it has 

published its FY2019 Sustainability Report “Sustaining our Future” in line with the 

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework.  

 

The Sustainability Report is DMPL’s commitment to grow the business in a manner 

that sustains a healthy balance amongst diverse interests of all its stakeholders - 

consumers, customers, business partners, host communities, employees, and 

shareholders. 

 

The report captures the targets and performance of the Group’s sustainability priorities 

across six categories -- products, employees, environment, governance, communities 

and economy. The report also includes DMPL’s contribution to the 17 UN Sustainable 

Development Goals.  

 

Sustainability is deeply rooted in the Group’s history. As a leading global food 

company, sustainability is an integral part of DMPL’s long-range strategic plan to 

ensure that it stays on course in its commitment to “Sustaining our Future” in line 

with its vision – Nourishing Families. Enriching Lives. Every Day.
