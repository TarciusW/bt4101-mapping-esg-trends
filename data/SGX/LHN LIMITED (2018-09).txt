LHN LIMITED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018








Dear Stakeholders,

At LHN, we are committed to the long-term development 

of our business in a sustainable manner, with focus placed 

on four main pillars; namely, Protecting our Environment, 

Safeguard Health and Safety, Create A Fair Workplace and 

Cultivating Strong Business Values. 

We seek to embed sustainable practices in the Group’s 

everyday operations and align sustainability goals with the 

Group’s overall strategic direction, which is in the creation 

of productive and innovative spaces, as well as sustainable 

value for our stakeholders. A monitoring system is in place 

to ensure that the business is on track to achieve these goals 

and to continuously improve our performance of the selected 

material ESG factors. 

CREATING A FAIR AND INCLUSIVE WORKPLACE

The Group believes that human capital is the most valuable 

asset to our company. We ensure that our employees have 

access to a fair, collaborative and engaging workplace that is 

built upon a strong foundation – one that wholly embraces 

and celebrates diversity. Also, by investing in talent 

development, LHN is well-placed with a competitive edge in 

the countries we operate in.

ESTABLISHING STRONG CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The crux of a sustainable business begins with having the 

right business values - good corporate governance and risk 

management. The Group is committed to conduct business 

operations in an ethical and responsible manner. We urge 

our employees to act with integrity and accountability for the 

activities that we undertake, even beyond the parameters 

of our organisation. Moreover, we have in place internal 

review processes to ensure that we stay compliant with the 

applicable laws and regulations set out by the competent 

local authorities in the respective countries or jurisdictions 

that we operate in.

TRANSITIONING TO A LOW CARBON FUTURE 

Over the years, we have implemented several initiatives to 

improve energy efficiency across our business segments, 

such as the use of energy-saving LED lightings and water 

saving taps under the Space Optimisation Business. 

As we expand our Logistics Services Business, all new 

prime movers satisfy Euro 4 and 5 Standards to ensure 

optimum fuel-efficiency and low emissions. The Group is 

also proud to share that we have embarked on our journey 

towards renewable energy by conducting feasibility study 

on the installation of solar panels on selected buildings’ 

rooftops. We are excited to share the progress in our 

subsequent sustainability report for the financial year ending 

30 September 2019. 

 

CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE

As a Group, we will continue to sustain our efforts as well 

as to identify areas for further improvements. We ask of your 

continued support in our sustainability journey.

PERFORMANCE AND HIGHLIGHTS

1. Pertains to electricity consumption and water consumption in the common areas that is within the Group’s control.

2. The electricity consumption excludes Greenhub properties and the Headquarter as the energy consumption for those properties was immaterial.

3. While the total electricity consumption includes the usage in common areas for both inside the buildings and outside the buildings (e.g. decorative light fixtures and lamp posts in 

surrounding areas), except for Work+Store which includes the tenanted area. Whereas, our energy intensity is calculated based on common floor areas within the building only because 

the lighting for outside the building is not attributable to any floor area. The energy intensity is therefore more conservative.

4. The fuel intensity is estimated at 2.5 km travelled per liter for GHG emission intensity calculation purpose.

Our Year’s Progress: Energy

2020 Target

In view of the recent occurrences of extreme weather surrounding climate change and water being a precious resource, the 

Group recognises that it needs to do its part as a responsible corporate in reducing its overall GHG footprint and improve its 

water conservation efforts.

• To achieve a 5% reduction in 

electrical consumption intensity 

by 2020 with FY2017 as base 

year.

• Maintain fuel consumption 

intensity with FY2017 as base 

year.

Energy • Space Optimisation Business

In FY2018, our electricity consumption2 was 4,514 MWh. The increase in 

electricity consumption by approximately 16% from FY2017 to FY2018 was 

attributed to the increase in the occupancy rates for Work+Store units. At the 

same time, our gross floor area covered within this report was reduced due to 

the property renewal process carried out this year. As a result, energy intensity3 

of Space Optimisation Business for FY2018 increased by 30% from  

0.10 MWh/m2 in FY2017 to 0.13 MWh/m2 and emission intensity increased by 

25% from 0.04 TCO2e/m2 in FY2017 to 0.05 TCO2e/m2.

Energy • Logistics Services Business

The energy consumed has increased in FY2018; corresponding to the increase 

in distance travelled (FY2018: 2.2 million km; FY2017: 1.9 million km). 

Our emissions are partly mitigated by the high percentage of euro 4 and 5 

standards prime movers within our fleet which are of higher energy efficiency. 

Our fuel consumption intensity4 on the other hand, has remained unchanged at 

0.0011 TCO2e/km in FY2018.

about 48%

of the properties we managed1 

utilised energy-saving LED 

lighting

100%

Investment in renewable energy

In progressing towards a low carbon economy, we have begun our transition 

towards renewable energy generation. In FY2018, we conducted feasibility 

study of installation of solar panels on our rooftop space of buildings with longer 

tenures. We look forward to share more details on the project in our report for 

the financial year ending 2019.

Group wide Environment Policy

Besides various sustainability practices that are currently in place, LHN is 

looking forward to formalising our environmental management system in the 

Group Environment Policy.

In FY2018, the water used5 for common toilet facilities and landscaping purposes 

amounted to 52,415m3, a decrease of approximately 15% from 61,583m3 in 

FY2017. This is largely attributed to the installation of water saving taps for the 

properties we managed, which has increased from 65% in FY2017 to 73% of the 

portfolio in FY2018. We are committed to adopt water saving features for 100% 

of newly acquired properties. We will continue the close monitoring of water 

consumption at existing properties to detect any water leakages and implement 

further water conservation initiatives as necessary to improve our performance. 

We do not have any concerns in sourcing water that is fit for our purposes.

about 73%

of the properties we managed5

Key measures to prevent reoccurrence of work-related incidents include:

Slip and falls within premises 

• Employees are regularly reminded to have appropriate footwear and safety 

shoes, where necessary.

• Walkways are to be kept clear and free of clutter as part of the shared 

responsibility between all employees and buildings’ management team. 

• Checks are performed to ensure lightings and floorings are in good condition 

and signage are strategically placed to caution employees.

Vehicle related accidents

• Email periodic reminders on the importance of taking necessary precautions 

on the road; especially, during rainy season.

• Enforce employees’ attendance for trainings on road safety 

• Ensure that safety cones or signs are put at a good distance or with great 

visibility to warn other drivers of ongoing repair and maintenance works in 

the vicinity

LHN LIMITED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018


PERFORMANCE AND HIGHLIGHTS

We pride ourselves on strong, mutually beneficial relationships formed with our customers. We seek to maintain a track record 

of service quality excellence and in being a trusted business partner for all suppliers, customers and tenants working with us.

Our Year’s Progress: Customer Satisfaction

Annual Targets

Satisfaction result score of:

• Space Optimisation Business: 70%

• Facilities Management Business 

(including security services): 70% 

and above

• Logistics Services Business: 90%

With the positive survey results, it motivates us as a Group to continue 

delivering a high standard of service quality and work across our operations. 

Our Logisitics Services Business team, albeit falling slightly short in meeting 

the internal target of achieving 90% customer satisfaction rating, has done 

better than the expected target of 70% as per ISO9001 quality objectives. 

Furthermore, with the establishment of our Service Excellence Committee 

(“SEC”), all divisions will continue to work closely towards service quality 

improvement by solidifying LHN’s service DNA – HEART value and translate 

these values into better experiences for our customers.

PERFORMANCE AND HIGHLIGHTS

In cascading the HEART values throughout the 

organisation, the SEC developed a four-pronged 

approach:

1. INFORMATION – Spreading awareness on 

HEART values to employees via town halls and 

meetings.

2. TRAINING – Training employees on service 

standards, service vision and service excellence.

3. GOODWILL GESTURES – Strategic discounts 

to be considered for long-term customers and 

sponsorship of customers’ events in building 

relationships.

4. REWARD AND RECOGNITION – Recognising 

and rewarding the best performing service 

employees.

Spreading of HEART values to our blue-collar workers 

This year, the SEC went the extra mile to reach out to our blue-collar employees 

who are often not at LHN’s premises and are typically not accustomed to formal 

corporate town halls and meetings.

The members of SEC travelled to various work sites to hold casual but 

intimate sharing lunches with employees on LHN’s HEART values. At the end 

of these sessions, a short video was produced to encapsulate key messages with 

keen participation from our employees. The video serves as a reminder for all 

employees to deliver genuine and reliable service from the heart. This video was 

subsequently shared to the public on YouTube.

PERFORMANCE AND HIGHLIGHTS

Besides provision of a productive space, LHN GreenHub works closely with 

our tenants to build a thriving entrepreneur community. Greenhub’s biannual 

networking events are good opportunities for the tenants to showcase their 

products and services to other potential buyers. 

Various workshops such as Etiquette Training and Public Speaking are run 

throughout the year for our tenants' benefit.

Our operation officers regularly patrol all of our carpark locations in Singapore to 

mitigate any potential service disruption. They are available 24 hours a day and 

are immediately deployed when technical issues arise on a day-to-day basis. 

The technical issues at car parks are monitored through handheld devices 

of each operation officer. The tracking ensures technical issues are resolved 

on a timely basis. Any recurring problems will be flagged out by the system for 

improvement.

PERFORMANCE AND HIGHLIGHTS

Our Year’s Progress: Security of Information &amp; Corporate Governance

Annual Targets

• Zero substantiated complaints or 

identified leaks, thefts or losses of 

customer data

• Zero confirmed incidents of 

corruption

• Zero non-compliance cases with 

applicable laws and regulations

Security of Information 

In assuring that all personal data entrusted to LHN remains private and is 

properly stored, used and disseminated without being subjected to third party 

abuse, we have since developed a Personal Data Protection (“PDP”) policy 

which abides by the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) in 

overseeing that we meet the necessary requirements.

To implement and monitor compliance with the PDP policy, the Group has 

established a Data Protection Committee (“DPC”) led by a designated Data 

Protection Officer (“DPO”) to oversee matters relating to data protection and 

privacy. The DPC spreads awareness to employees via email on prevalent 

security risks such as malware attacks or phishing emails that may affect the 

organisation.

Anti-Corruption and Compliance

LHN has put in place the appropriate corporate policies and guidelines, 

targeting the improprieties in relation to bribery, extortion, fraud and money 

laundering, which are aligned with Code of Corporate Governance 2012, 

Rules of the Catalist and other applicable laws and regulations in all operating 

countries. This is in line with the Group’s stance to maintain high ethical 

standards which are integral to our corporate identity and business.

Whistle-blowing policy and procedures

Our whistle-blowing policy aims to provide an avenue for employees and any 

external parties to report and raise, in good faith and in confidence, their 

concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or 

other matters and offer re-assurance that they will be protected from reprisals 

or victimisation for whistle-blowing in good faith. All whistle-blowing reports 

are directed to the audit committee chairman via a dedicated email address 

(gary.chan@lhngroup.com.sg).

There were no whistleblowing reports received via our whistleblowing 

channels during this reporting period. We also managed to maintain our 

unblemished records of zero confirmed incidents of corruption. However, there 

was one fine imposed in FY2018 relating to overladen container by our Logistics 

Services Business in Singapore. Since the incident, we have improved on our 

internal procedures in requiring total cargo weight to be confirmed before any 

exports to prevent re-occurrence. 

We will continue to work toward attaining our target of zero non-compliance 

cases with applicable laws and regulations that have a significant impact on the 

financials, business or operations of the Group in the subsequent years to come.

PERFORMANCE AND HIGHLIGHTS

Create A Fair Workplace

As an employer, we believe that a diverse work environment will fuel innovation and ideas which are core to our business. 

Further pledging our commitment to TAFEP, we pride ourselves in being an employer who practices fair employment and 

provides equal opportunities to all.

Our Year’s Progress: Fair Employment Practices

Annual Targets

Employee Profile

• No confirmed cases of 

discriminations 

• Organise town halls for blue-collar 

employees at least once a year 

1. Total number of employees by 

employment type:

FY2017^

FY2018

We strongly believe that allowing our employees to have equal opportunities and 

fair treatment is crucial as it builds the confidence of our employees and their 

respect towards the Company. LHN is committed to the Tripartite Alliance for 

Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP) 5 Principles, which promotes the adoption 

of fair, responsible and progressive employment practices among employers, 

employees and the general public. All LHN’s job applications, internal transfers 

and promotions are merit-based regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, age and 

gender. 

An established Employee Grievance Policy allows employees to raise 

any potential mistreatment or violations of Labour Laws to supervisors and 

management of LHN. We conduct town halls twice a year to receive employee’s 

feedback, and provide employee feedback boxes in office. All feedback are 

reviewed immediately for improvement actions. 

The Group has complied with all relevant Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) 

guidelines for FY2018. We also strictly enforce no child labour or forced labour 

policy, no keeping of passports and no loans provided to foreign workers in 

return to be bonded for a specific time.

In FY2018, our workforce consisted of 445 employees; including 311 

males and 134 females. Our headcount includes more male employees due 

to the physical requirements of our labour-intensive operations; particularly 

in the Facilities Management Business and Logistics Services Business. The 

significant portion of our operations are conducted by our employees; although, 

we engage contractors occasionally for miscellaneous tasks such as compound 

cleaning, transportation of chemical or oil related products, landscaping, lift 

maintenance and fire alarm maintenance works.

Fair Employment Practices • New Hires and Employee Turnover Rates^

In FY2018, there were 315 new hires (FY2017: 171 new hires). The 

recruitment is to mostly replace resignees which amounted to 323 employees 

(FY2017: 139 resignees). Our turnover rate for the year averages at 72.6% 

(FY2017: 30.7%) largely due to the high turnover within the Facilities 

Management Business, in particular security services as well as the termination 

of many inactive part-time staff. The security industry in recent years have 

been plagued with a lack of resources and high turnover. We also appreciate the 

challenge to keep offsite staff engaged due to limited interaction. To address 

this problem, in 2019, we look forward to holding two town halls; specifically 

for blue-collar workers so that they could share any feedback/ comments on 

the work environment. It also provides an opportunity for management to 

communicate the business initiatives to keep the staff informed and engaged.

Fair Employment Practices • Average Training Hours by gender and employee 

category^

At LHN, the investment in learning and development is strongly emphasised as 

it ensures that the Group stays competitive in driving growth. In encouraging 

lifelong learning, LHN’s Training Policy allows for training sponsorship that targets 

at the development needs of our employees. In FY2018, we have achieved total 

training hours of 3,601 hours, which means 8.09 hours on average per employee 

(FY2017: total 5,289 hours, which means 11.68 hours on average per employee). 

The training courses covers a wide range of subjects from business related courses 

such as financial reporting and business analytics to health and safety trainings, 

and other subject matters relevant to our operations. 

In addition, LHN is committed to the practice of meritocracy. Our reward 

and compensation system is based solely on employees’ performance, in which 

the Performance Appraisal Policy sets out clear procedures for the evaluation of 

performance. To ensure a fair and just evaluation, employees are judged not only 

on the results attained, but also on the process which led to the overall outcome. 

Beyond that, LHN dedicates itself to open discussions with employees on their 

development and performance conducted by managerial levels and above.

• In the coming year, we will identify competency requirements and establish 

corresponding training programs for staff in our core business segments. The 

training will aim to cover the necessary technical and soft skillsets, including 

on-the-job training.

• To strengthen our efforts in improving talent retention, we are working 

towards implementing employee engagement programmes to boost staff-

wellness and keep them motivated.

PERFORMANCE AND HIGHLIGHTS

Create A Fair Workplace

Due to the nature of the Group’s business, many of our employees are stationed 

offsite (e.g. our cleaning and security staff) or are continuously on the move 

(e.g. our drivers). LHN’s social events are scheduled around their working 

schedule to ensure the highest participation from all staff.

A separate town hall is held for staff who could not attend the company's 

regular town hall due to their job requirements. The town hall allows the 

management to receive feedback and to keep the staff updated on key 

developments of the Group.
