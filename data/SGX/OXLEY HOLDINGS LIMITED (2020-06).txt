Dear Stakeholders,

I am pleased to present the 

Sustainability Report of Oxley 

Holdings Limited (the “Company”, 

and together with its subsidiaries,  

"Oxley" or the “Group”) for the 

financial year ended 30 June 

2020 (“FY2020”), which provides 

information on the economic, 

environmental and social aspects 

of our sustainability practices 

in 3 major operating segments, 

namely property development, 

hospitality and construction. As 

we expand our footprint overseas, 

we endeavour to continually 

integrate sustainability practices 

into our business operations. The 

Group places strong emphasis on 

the environmental sustainability in 

the design and construction of our 

residential, commercial and hotel 

properties. We aim to achieve eco-

efficiency and prioritise occupants’ 

health and safety in our property 

design and construction. Our 

commitment to workplace health 

and safety is reflected in our strong 

advocacy among contractors and 

suppliers on the importance of 

maintaining safe work practices.

In the hospitality sector, the Group 

has implemented practices to 

safeguard the health and safety of 



our hotel guests and associates. 

We monitor our hotel operation 

closely to ensure  environmental 

sustainability. In line with the 

Group’s philosophy in sustainability, 

we have implemented various 

green initiatives in the major 

operations and partnered with 

different 

organisations 

on 

charitable events, including WWF, 

Free Food for All and treatsure, 

to drive sustainability. Through 

the participation in various social 

campaigns, we strive to contribute 

to our community and promote 

environmental protection. 

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, 

our hotels have signed up to 

provide accommodation to those 

served with Stay Home Notices 

and as isolation and quarantine 

facilities for people with mild 

symptoms. Whilst providing the 

facilities to enable the country to 

contain the virus, the hotels have 

implemented strict measures 

to protect the health and safety 

of the associates working at the 

hotels. The hotels have also signed 

up for programmes to second the 

associates to work places and 

government agencies who need 

the extra pair of hands, strongly 

encouraged the associates to 

attend training courses to improve 

their skills and knowledge, and 

implemented short work week 

and voluntary no pay leave 

programmes. These initiatives have 

enabled the hotels to avoid layoffs 

during this challenging time.  

This year, we have expanded 

our disclosure of the sustainable 

practices undertaken by the 

project development segment. We 

are introducing the sustainable 

business practices which our 

partners on the construction sites 

have implemented in this report. 

The construction sector focuses 

on environmental protection, 

occupational health and safety, 

and employees’ training and 

development. We are committed 

to prioritising the well-being of the 

employees and minimising any 

adverse impact on the environment 

while growing  our business. 

At Oxley, we believe that a diverse 

workforce brings different skill sets 

and experience to the Group. Our 

workforce comprises  employees of 

different genders and nationalities 

from different age groups as well 

as post-retirement employees. We 

value the contributions of all our 

associates and remunerate them 

fairly.

On behalf of the board of directors 

(the “Board”), I would like to express 

my gratitude to our clients, business 

partners and shareholders for their 

unwavering support over the years. 

We look forward to your continuing 

support as we strive to develop a 

more sustainable environment for 

all.

CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE

OXLEY HOLDINGS LIMITED  |  SUSTAINABILITY  REPORT 2020

Oxley  is an international property group incorporated in 

2010 and headquartered in Singapore. Oxley specialises 

in the development of quality residential, commercial, 

industrial and hospitality projects. These developments 

are typically located in choosen areas that are easily 

accessible. Most of its projects incorporate retail elements, 

as well as lifestyle features and facilities.

Oxley is listed on the Main Board of the SGX-ST (SGX: 5UX) 

and has a market capitalisation of approximately $0.9 

billion as at 11 September 2020. Since its incorporation, 

Oxley has launched a portfolio of 48 projects, of which 

33 projects have been completed.

Oxley has a strong reputation in market foresight, 

execution, marketing and sales, which is evident in its 

project track record in Singapore in the past years. The 

Group has launched and sold more than 3,109 residential 

and commercial units in Singapore since April 2018. In the 

hospitality space, the Group owns the 254-room Novotel 

Singapore on Stevens and 518-room Mercure Singapore 

on Stevens which are located in a lush urban paradise just 

minutes away from the iconic Orchard Road shopping 

belt and Botanic Gardens, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Building on this strong foundation, Oxley has also made 

remarkable progress in expanding its footprint overseas. 

Currently the Group has overseas business presence 

across 9 geographical markets namely the United Kingdom 

(the “UK”), Ireland, Cyprus, Cambodia, Malaysia, Myanmar, 

China, Vietnam and Australia. Its overseas flagship projects 

include Royal Wharf, a waterfront township development 

in London, The Peak and The Bridge, two mixed-use 



developments in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and Dublin 

Landings, one of the largest mixed-use developments in 

the business district of Dublin, Ireland. The Group has 

acquired Deanston Wharf, a site adjacent to Royal Wharf, 

which is to be developed into a mixed-use development. 

Additionally, the Group has expanded into Vietnam and is 

going to launch a 270-unit residential development in Ho 

Chi Minh City for sale by the end of 2020. Closer to home, 

Oxley and its partners have entered into a conditional sale 

and purchase agreement to acquire 29 acres of freehold 

land to be developed into a mixed-use development in 

Penang, Malaysia.

In May 2018, an Irish statutory corporation appointed 

Oxley as a partner for the redevelopment of a site at 

the core city centre in Dublin - Connolly Station site. The 

design and planning works for the residential elements 

have been completed while the planning works for the 

commercial elements are currently still in progress and 

expected to be completed by the end of the year. Site 

preparation work has commenced and the residential 

construction works and the sales launch are expected to 

commence in the coming months. The development may 

comprise 680 residential units, a hotel building as well as 

retail and office space.

Oxley holds approximately 10% stake in Aspen (Group) 

Holdings Limited, a Malaysian based property group listed 

on Catalist in Singapore. 

Oxley also holds a 100% stake in Pindan Group Pty Ltd, 

an integrated property group based in Western Australia.

REPORTING PRACTICE


10

OXLEY HOLDINGS LIMITED  |  SUSTAINABILITY  REPORT 2020

Oxley is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen in the communities that we operate in, 

and we endeavour to deliver safe, efficient, environmentally sustainable and high-quality property 

developments. We strive to minimise our impact on the environment by reducing our carbon footprint 

and water consumption.

Sustainable Building

At Oxley, we are committed to designing green and sustainable buildings. All of our properties have/

will receive Green Mark certifications, which is a testament to our commitment to maintaining the 

environmental friendliness and sustainability of our buildings in terms of design, construction and 

operations. We continuously work towards improving the energy and water efficiency of our properties, 

and complying with national environmental standards for property development projects in Singapore 

and overseas.



Featured Story

Kent Ridge Hill 

Residences, Singapore

The development of Kent Ridge Hill 

Residences 

("KRH") 

uses 

sustainable 

building 

products 

such 

as 

laminate, 

plastering, ceiling board, and dry partitions. 

Prefabricated bathroom units (“PBUs”) are 

used to reduce manpower and control 

the material and prefabrication process, 

resulting in higher quality finishes and 

lower wastage.

Energy Efficiency

The development is designed with a minimum number 

of west-facing units to avoid high temperature in 

the apartments during sunny afternoons in tropical 

Singapore to lower the energy usage to cool the 

apartments. The apartment units are equipped with 

4-tick energy-efficient air conditioners and energy-

efficient lift with sleep mode features.

Water Saving

The development uses Excellent and Very Good Water 

Efficiency Labelling Scheme ("WELS") rated water 

fittings to optimise water usage and conserve water 

resources. 

Smart Features

Smart features are incorporated into the apartment including Smart Homehub, Smart air-conditioners, Smart digital 

lock, and WIFI doorbell with a camera, that allow residents to control devices and sensors in one Smart home system.

Sustainable Facilities

The external area is designed with sustainable features. Sheltered bicycle lots are provided to support low carbon 

commuting while recycling bins are provided to encourage recycling and reduce waste in daily lives.

PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT


11

OXLEY HOLDINGS LIMITED  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

1953, Singapore

The development is designed to obtain Green Mark certification when the development is completed. 

Similar to KRH, PBUs are adopted to ensure high quality finishing and low wastage.



PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT

Energy Efficiency

Heat reducing tinted windows are selected while 

minimal jumbo glasses are  used in the project 

to cut down on greenhouse effect. The common 

area of the development  is equipped with motion-

sensor lighting and features that promote a cooling 

and well-ventilated living environment. 

Smart Features

Smart features are incorporated into the apartment 

including Smart Homehub, Smart air-conditioners, 

Smart digital lock, and WIFI doorbell with a camera, 

that  allow residents to control devices and sensors 

in one Smart home system.

Green Environment

The external area is line with shady trees to provide residents with an oasis despite living in the city centre. 

Transportation

To optimise the use of space, the development offers an underground automated mechanised car parking system. To 

encourage vehicles emission reduction, sheltered bicycle lots are provided for the residents to consider using bicycle 

as an alternative mean of transportation.


12

OXLEY HOLDINGS LIMITED  |  SUSTAINABILITY  REPORT 2020

Occupant Safety

In addition to creating sustainable building designs, 

our priority is to ensure our buyers are offered high 

quality and safe properties. 

The Group’s property development projects comply 

with local design and construction requirements 

and guidelines. For example, in compliance with 

BCA Code on Accessibility in the Built Environment, 

we have implemented barrier-free access in our 

properties to ensure our buildings are accessible 

and user-friendly to  persons with disabilities and 

families with young children.

To ensure fire safety, we have implemented the 

Home Fire Alarm Device (“HFAD”) which sounds an 

early warning to alert the occupants of an impending 

fire.

We comply with CONQUAS, an assessment system 

developed by BCA, for the construction of our 

properties. The assessment goes through tests that 

evaluate the properties in consideration of safety, 

comfort and aesthetic defects for the building 

occupants.

In FY2020, there was no incidence of non-compliance 

with health and safety regulations at our properties.

Construction Safety Management

Apart from ensuring construction quality, the 

Group has gone the extra mile to ensure that all 

contractors and subcontractors are notified of their 

worksite health and safety responsibilities during the 

vendor selection process, and are able to meet the 

standards that qualify for International Organisation 

for Standardisation (“ISO”) certifications.

We have also appointed a Design for Safety (“DfS”) 

professional to identify and implement measures 

to eliminate and mitigate the risks inherent in 

the projects during the design, construction and 

completion stages. This reduces the health and 

safety risks in the construction, and ongoing 

maintenance and repair processes.

In FY2020, there was no occupational health and 

safety incident at our project sites.  

Contractor and Supplier Management

We ensure that the practices and policies of our 

contractors and suppliers are in line with ours. All 

contractors and subcontractors are reviewed and 

selected based on performance, workplace health 

and safety, environmental and social criteria, while 

all suppliers are reviewed and selected based on 

their product quality and timeliness of delivery.

We assess new contractors and subcontractors 

based on their track records and worksite health and 

safety practices during the quotation and tendering 

process before awarding the contract. Those who 

do not meet our standards will be delisted from our 

approved list of vendors.

During FY2020, we assessed all construction 

contractors and subcontractors according to our 

quotation and tendering selection criteria. There 

had been no breach of environmental and labour 

laws by our contractors and subcontractors.  

Energy, Emissions and Water Management

Oxley is committed to working closely with 

contractors and subcontractors to manage its 

energy efficiency and carbon footprint. They are 

required to comply with our environmental policies 

and guidelines at all geographical locations where 

we operate.

Apart from implementing energy-efficient features 

such as Light-emitting Diode (“LED”) lights along 

the corridors of our properties and photovoltaics 

where possible to conserve daily energy usage, we 

adopt energy-efficient air-conditioning systems 

and motion-sensor lightings in the toilets to reduce 

energy consumption. Our properties are also 

designed with water-efficient features that adhere 

to local regulations and requirements.

In FY2020, there was no environmental non-

compliance at our project sites.

OXLEY HOLDINGS LIMITED  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

Property Marketing

At Oxley, we strictly comply with Controller of Housing (“COH”) guidelines which require show units to be 

accurately depicted. We also obtain the approval of COH for our building plans before opening our show 

flats for viewing.

Below are the key COH guidelines that we comply with:

Show unit has to be 

built according to the 

approved building 

plan

Floor ceiling height 

and dimensions of the 

unit have to be the 

same as depicted

Display a list of 

materials, finishes, 

fittings and appliances 

which will be provided

the show unit

Prominently display 

written notice on the 

interior design to 

show the differences 

between the actual 

unit and show unit

All floor spaces to be 

built in accordance 

with the approved 

building plan, 

including balcony, 

air-con ledge and any 

other spaces which 

form part of the show 

unit













By complying with COH guidelines, we provide assurance to prospective buyers that our show units 

accurately represent the units for sale and ensure that there is no marketing misrepresentation.

In FY2020, there was zero incidence of non-compliance concerning marketing communication of our 

properties.

Fines and Penalty

laws and regulations.

PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT

OXLEY HOLDINGS LIMITED  |  SUSTAINABILITY  REPORT 2020

Oxley actively manages its hotel operator and 

ensures strict compliance with local environmental 

and social laws and regulations. We aim to provide 

a positive hospitality experience while keeping a 

sustainable operation. We prioritise the health 

and safety of our guests and employees through 

implementing good food and physical safety 

practices.

Guest Health and Safety

Since the outbreak of the COVID-19, the hotels 

have been signed up as facilities to provide 

accommodation for people served with Stay-Home 

notices and/or exhibit mild symptoms that do not 

require hospitalisation. The hotels are highly vigilant 

to the potential impact of health and safety on our 

guests and employees. Apart from strengthening 

the sanitisation in the hotel area, precautionary 

measures such as temperature screening before 

entering the hotels and movement monitoring 

through safe entry check-in applications are 

implemented. The hotels strictly follow the social 

distancing measures and will review the relevant 

policies regularly in order to adhere to government 

work policies and ensure the safety of the employees 

working in the facilities.

Food safety audits are regularly conducted to provide 

hotel guests the transparency and assurance of high 

food safety standards. The hotels achieved “A” grade 

in the most recent food safety certification. 

The hotel operator, Accor, is a reputable international 

hotel management group. The hotel management 

team takes the safety and security of the hotel 

guests seriously and regularly review the safety 

measures. Proper safety measures are put in place 

such as implementing fire safety measures and 

conducting routine fire drills at the hotel premises. 

Security cameras are installed at the hotel premises 

and only hotel guests are able to gain access to their 

hotel rooms with their room cards. During FY2020, 

the hotels obtained the Hotel Security Award 2019, 

issued by Singapore Hotel Association, Singapore 

Police Force and National Crime Prevention Council, 

certifying the effectiveness of our measures and our 

ability to execute the measures. 

The hotel building glass is tinted with blue color to 

create a peaceful and calm environment for the 

guests. The hotels have participated in various 

campaigns such as #SeeItBlue that raise the 

awareness of mental health. 

The hotel operator is required to comply with 

National Environment Agency (“NEA”) and other 

local health and safety regulations. During FY2020, 

there was no incidence of non-compliance with 

guest health and safety regulations.

Occupational Health and Safety

The Group is aware that staff health and safety 

is an important consideration in running  a hotel 

business. During the initial selection of the hotel 

operator, we assessed the safety practices and 

procedures in maintaining employee health and 

safety. We also assess the hotel operator annually 

to ensure that there is no breach of employee 

health and safety regulations and protocols. The 

hotel operator has to train the associates  regularly 

to adhere to safety policies. We periodically review 

safety risks and implement safety measures to 

mitigate these risks.

In FY2020, there was no breach of regulations on 

occupational health and safety.

Sustainable Food Innovations

In order to achieve sustainability through food 

sourcing, the hotels purchase products from 

suppliers who are socially responsible and use 

ingredients that are manufactured with minimum 

carbon footprint wherever possible. In our hotels, 

the use of overfished species of fishes including 

sharks, rays, bluefin tunas, groupers, eels and caviar 

from wild sturgeons are banned. Commonly used 

herbs in the kitchen are grown in the herb garden 

in the hotels so that we can control the process and 

cut-down on the use of pesticides in an effort to 

offer diners tasty and nutritious food. 

With the expanding vegan population brought about 

by growing awareness of the benefits of a vegan diet 

and the positive impact it has on sustainability, the 

restaurants in our hotels have added plant-based 

meat, Beyond Burger and Beyond Meatballs, to the 

menu.

During FY2020, our food and beverage ("F&amp;B")

outlets operated by the hotels, Food Exchange 

and Winestone, were awarded the Singapore’s Top 

Restaurants by Wine &amp; Dine and were included in the 

annual dining guide of SALT Selections 2019/2020. 

The team is honoured to achieve these awards as 

a recognition of the food quality and a motivation 

to continue to innovate and offer high quality and 

good tasting menu to the hotel guests and diners. 

Food Waste Management

Mercure Singapore on Stevens has partnered with 

a local start-up, treatsure, in an effort to reduce 

food waste at our hotel buffets through the power 

of technology and new solutions to repackage 

and redistribute food to those who need them. 

Treatsure offers boxes for guests to takeaway non-

perishable food from the buffet tables. For a small 

fee. Guests are able to savour the gourmet delights 

in the comfort of their home whilst playing their part 

in reducing food waste.

Energy and Emissions Management

Electricity is the major source of the hotels’ 

energy consumption and greenhouse gas ("GHG") 

emissions. To reduce energy usage and emissions 

in the  daily operations, 80% of the lights installed 

at our hotels are energy-efficient LED lights. We 

encourage associates to practise environmentally 

friendly habits such as switching off lights and air-

conditioning in vacant rooms.

For 4 months in FY2020, the hotels were 

functioning under government contracts to provide 

accommodation to those served with Stay-Home 

notices and as Government Quarantine Facilities. 

Services that were usually offered in pre-COVID-19 

environment such as change of linen is significantly 

reduced. As a result, the energy consumption and 

GHG emissions for both hotels have decreased in 

FY2020 as compared to FY2019.

Waste Management

To minimise the risk of pollution and the spread 

of diseases, the hotels implement proper waste 

management procedures in the daily operation. 

The disposal of dry waste such as paper, metal 

and plastic is outsourced to a professional waste 

management company. This ensures that waste is 

disposed of in a proper manner that is in compliance 

with local health codes.

Additionally, the hotels implemented sustainable 

initiatives to reduce overall wastage. The hotels 

have signed the Plastic ACTion initiated by WWF-

Singapore, which aims to eliminate plastic pollution 

and ultimately move towards a circular economy 

on plastics. To support such aims, all plastic straws 

and plastic stirrers are not used in the hotels, and 

all takeaway packaging products are replaced with 

biodegradable options. We have also eradicated 

the use of plastic bottles at events and seminars 

and replaced with reusable water jugs and cups. In 

addition, we endeavour to minimise the change of 

towels and bed linens. Guests have the options to 

reduce the frequency of changing their towels and 

bed linens during their stay at the hotels. We are 

currently in the midst of eradicating plastic cotton 

buds and progressively replacing other disposable 

plastic products  and individually packaged material 

with more ecological options. 

The hotels continuously work with Accor’s global and 

regional procurement teams to identify and adopt 

greener solutions in the hotel operation. The hotels 

have partnered with Soap for Hope to reduce the 

wastage from discarded soap bars. The soap bars 

collected from the rooms are cleaned and pressed 

into new scented soap bars. Natural ingredients, 

such as lemongrass or ginger, are added to the soap 

bars to give the soap bars a new scent and to serve 

multiple purposes such as repelling mosquitoes. To 

date, more than 2,000 migrant workers in Singapore 

have received over 300 kilograms of transformed 

and newly-scented soap bars. 

 

Environmental Awareness

The Group is an active supporter of local charitable 

events. Since January 2019, the Group has 

participated in initiatives to collect, sort, clean and  

donate clothes to less privileged communities in 

Singapore. In April and May 2020, we participated in 

a donation drive to collect clothes and miscellaneous 

items including toothbrush, toothpaste and hand 

sanitiser for the migrant worker community.

In addition, the hotels participated in the Earth Hour 

2020 by encouraging the guests to switch off the 

lights in their rooms and join the commemorative 

event at the F&amp;B outlets to raise awareness of the 

public towards energy conservation. The main 

facade lights and logo lights of the hotels were 

switched off during the Earth Hour, and the lights 

in the lobbies and restaurants were dimmed.

Protecting Customer Privacy and Data

Oxley takes utmost care in protecting the privacy 

and data of hotel guests. The hotels are in strict 

compliance with the PDPA. 

There was no reported breach of data privacy 

regulation in FY2020.

Fines and Penalty

Our selected hotel operator, Accor, ensures strict 

compliance with the local and international legal 

frameworks, including the International Labour 

Organisation’s fundamental conventions and the 

ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact. 

Accor exercises due diligence when assessing their 

suppliers and service providers to ensure there 

are no incidences of child labour and forced or 

compulsory labour.

In FY2020, there was no incidence of non-

compliance with social laws and regulations on non-

discrimination, child labour, forced or compulsory 

labour and infringement of human rights.

OXLEY HOLDINGS LIMITED  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

Occupational Health and Safety

Employees’ safety is regarded as the top priority 

as our service delivery may involve high-risk 

activities such as construction activities at high 

levels. A conducive working environment will boost 

employees’ morale and increase the workforce’s 

productivity and efficiency. The Group is committed 

to providing healthy and safe working environment 

for all employees and contractors, and strives to 

achieve zero tolerance toward hazards, incidents, 

non-compliance and accidents.

To oversee the implementation of the Australian 

group’s safety policy and control the risks in the 

construction projects, the operation has established 

an occupational health and safety management 

system which was audited internally and externally. 

All associates, including those who are not under 

the payroll but whose work is controlled by the 

Australian team, are covered under our occupational 

health and safety management system.

The workers are  equipped with effective personal 

protective equipment such as helmets, safety 

goggles, hearing protectors, fall arrestors and 

full-body safety harnesses. The workers are 

also provided with sufficient training to protect 

themselves against injuries that could be sustained 

on the construction sites. Training is provided on 

proper handling of dangerous equipment such as 

chainsaws, lawn mowers and whipper snippers. 

To prevent the outbreak of COVID-19 among the 

associates, the associates are taught the basics of 

detecting and preventing the virus, controlling the 

spread of the virus and responding immediately to 

the symptoms. 

During FY2020, there were no breach of regulations 

on occupational health and safety and work-related 

fatalities.

Construction is our business segment operating in Australia. We strive to achieve and maintain a high-

quality standard for our construction projects. During FY2020, two projects were granted three Master 

Builders South West Building Excellence Awards in 2020, namely Best Regional Project, Best Health Care 

Building, and Best Education Building.

Training and Education

The Australian team  recognises that staff training 

and development is critical to the smooth day-to-

day operation and future growth of the business. 

Internal and external training courses are made 

available to the associates so that they can keep 

up with the industry development, maintain the 

relevance of their skills and contribute to the long-

term success of the operation. 

In addition to the  health and safety training courses 

mentioned in the “Occupational Health and Safety” 

section, we have established training programmes 

on risk management and emergency management 

for the associates’ professional development.  

To increase the service quality, we provided 

associates with training on service delivery, mobile 

solution and work-related process, including 

asbestos management, vehicles and driving, 

concrete cutting and hydration management.

During FY2020, our Australian workforce received 

approximately 3,000 hours of training.

Management

The management supports employees’ career 

development and discuss their plans through 

regular performance review to assess and provide 

feedback on their performance. During FY2020, 

approximately 83% of male associates and 80% 

of female associates at the Australian operation 

had received a regular performance appraisal. The 

percentage of senior management, management 

and general staff who received regular performance 

appraisals ranged from 60% to 95%. 

Energy and Water Management

For the construction operation, diesel is used as 

vehicle fuel and to power the generator. To reduce 

fuel consumption, the local team adopts eco-friendly 

measures and energy efficient initiatives, and trains 

associates to avoid keeping engines idle and plan 

travelling routes in advance to minimise repetition. 

The vehicles undergo regular maintenance servicing 

to ensure optimal engine performance and fuel 

usage.

Apart from energy conservation, the Australian 

team implements various water-saving initiatives 

and inculcates the workers with water conservation 

habit. 

During FY2020, the local team consumed 

approximately 1.9 million litres of diesel and 

approximately 129 million  litres of ground water 

at the construction sites.

Emissions and Disposal

The Australian operation’s GHG emissions are 

limited to direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions, generated 

from diesel consumption. During FY2020, the Group 

emitted approximately 5,000 tCO2e2.

Note:

2 Data is based on factors provided by The Clean Energy Regulator 

of Australian Government.

The Group does not generate hazardous waste in 

the construction activities. Construction waste is 

the major non-hazardous waste generated in the 

process which is recycled where possible. General 

types of recyclable construction waste include 

timber, concrete, steel, aluminium, and other 

metals. The remaining non-recyclable waste will be 

sent to the landfill. Other recycling effort includes 

recycling of paper and plastic in coordination with 

the local councils in Australia. During FY2020, the 

Australian operation disposed approximately 3,000 

m3 of non-hazardous waste. 

Fines and Penalty

During FY2020, the operation had no incidence 

of non-compliance with environmental and 

socioeconomic laws and regulations.
