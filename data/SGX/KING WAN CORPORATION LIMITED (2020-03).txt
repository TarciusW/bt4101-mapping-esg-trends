ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION 

TO SOCIETY 

The Group provides Mechanical and Electrical (“M&amp;E”) 

engineering services and portable lavatories in 

Singapore. We also have direct investments in vessel 

Ownership and Chartering, Property Development 

and operations in Workers’ Dormitory through 

our network of subsidiaries and associates in 

Singapore, Thailand and China. The Group operates 

our various business segments in accordance to 

the adopted sustainability practices through close 

collaboration with business partners to identify 

arising sustainability opportunities and risks.

The Group’s performance has a direct impact 

on our key stakeholders, including employees, 

customers, suppliers, government and investors. We 

therefore aim to deliver economic benefits through 

effective project management, efficient resource 

management, stable contribution to public finance 

and services, community engagement, bringing 

sustainable growth to our enterprise and ecosystem.

CORPORATE SOCIAL 

RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) 

CORPORATE SOCIAL 

RESPONSIBILITY INITIATIVE 

Corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) has evolved 

over the years to become an integral part of the 

organisation. It has expanded to more dimensions 

such as corporate responsibility to our stakeholders 

– 

our 

shareholders, 

employees, 

customers, 

suppliers, sub-contractors and the wider community. 

We actively seek to play a part to improve the 

environment and contribute to the well-being of the 

communities in which we live and do business.

As part of our community involvement, King Wan 

continues to contribute to  the Muscular Dystrophy 

Association (Singapore) (“MDAS”), an organisation 

that the Group has been actively supporting since 

2014. All corporate funds raised are channelled 

into supporting MDAS’ essential programmes 

and services for beneficiaries such as therapy 

sessions to help slow down muscle deterioration 

and transport subsidies for fetching beneficiaries 

between home and school in specialised vehicles. 

We also continue to promote opportunities for 

young adults with severe muscular dystrophy to 

be meaningfully employed by engaging them for 

print or web-based collaterals, through BizPower 

– a centre-based employment programme run by 

MDAS.

LEGAL COMPLIANCE AND 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

King Wan values corporate governance and legal 

compliance. It is of paramount importance that the 

Group abides by legal and regulatory requirements 

and is in compliance with, including but not limited 

to, the Code of corporate Governance issued by 

Monetary Authority of Singapore and guidelines 

provided by BCA, Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”), 

Singapore Civil Defence Force (”SCDF”), National 

Environmental Agency (”NEA”) and other relevant 

regulators.

For further details on Corporate Governance, please 

refer to pages 17 to 40 of the Annual Report.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY

The Company has set out procedures governing 

all interested persons transactions to ensure that 

they are carried out at arm’s length, on normal 

commercial terms and not be detrimental to the 

interests of the Group and our shareholders.

In FY2020, there was no identified conflict of 

interest between the Group and any interested 

party.

CUSTOMER PRIVACY POLICY

King Wan protects the privacy and confidentiality 

of our customers’ information. We do not divulge 

or sell personal information to third parties 

for marketing or promotional purposes. All 

employees are guided by King Wan’s Code of 

Business Conduct and Ethics. 

In FY2020, there was no identified case regarding 

breach of customer privacy or loss of customer 

data.

ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY

King 

Wan 

takes 

a 

strong 

stand 

against 

corruption and bribery in the Group. We provide 

an accessible platform for employees and third 

parties to raise concerns about any wrongdoing 

and improper conduct within the Group.

New employees are trained on the Code of 

Business Conduct and Ethics and briefed on the 

whistle-blowing policy.

In order to facilitate the reporting of suspected 

cases of fraud, corruption, workplace harassment 

or 

other 

improper 

activities, 

independent 

investigations are carried out in a timely manner. 

Appropriate action will be taken to correct any 

weaknesses in internal controls and policies to 

prevent a recurrence.

In FY2020, there were no incidents of corruption 

and no public legal cases brought against the 

Group or its employees.

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS  

AND REGULATIONS 

The Group has put in place policies and 

procedures to ensure compliance with relevant 

laws and regulations, particularly those relating 

to BCA, MOM, SCDF and NEA. At the corporate 

level, we also ensure that we are in compliance 

with the  SGX-ST Listing Rules, Securities and 

Futures Act and the Singapore Companies Act. 

Through 

constant 

monitoring, 

evaluation, 

and auditing of our ISO 45001:2018 certified 

Occupational 

Health 

and 

Safety 

(”OH&amp;S”) 

management system, King Wan actively ensures 

that all our activities and operations comply with 

existing regulatory requirements. Any changes 

and non-compliance with the relevant laws are 

made known to the management, and actions 

are taken to ensure compliance.

Towards ensuring continued improvement, we 

have reviewed and streamlined our processes 

to improve and tighten the procedures at 

construction sites.  In addition, we have 

implemented 

an 

ISO 

14001:2015 

certified 

Environmental, Health and Safety standard 

(“EHS”) management system.

King Wan Corporation Limited


At King Wan, we strive to carry out our business 

operations in a socially responsible manner and 

are committed to protecting the environment. We 

believe that the efficient use of natural resources 

such as energy and water will contribute positively 

to the Group’s sustainable growth in the long term.

We continue to use more energy-efficient lightings 

and lift in our office building, thereby reducing 

electricity consumption. Additionally, we use water-

efficient fittings and fixtures in our corporate office 

to reduce water consumption, as well as adopt 

environmentally friendly methods of waste disposal 

in our desilting business. 

The management also strongly encourages and 

reinforces the importance of practising the 3Rs (i.e. 

reduce, reuse and recycle) in our daily operations 

– the responsible usage of electricity, water and 

paper by every employee. King Wan believes that 

every small effort counts and goes a long way in 

contributing to the conservation and protection of 

the earth’s natural resources.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY 

As a result of our continuous efforts to reduce energy and water consumption, we recorded a 8.3% reduction 

in electricity consumption and maintained water consumption below the target limit of 35,000M3. This 

improvement allowed us to reduce our carbon footprint and enjoy 8.2% cost savings on our electricity bills.

WORKPLACE 

SAFETY &amp; HEALTH

At King Wan, we are guided by our philosophy “Lead 

the Way – Safety First” in our care for our employees 

and communities. Workplace safety and health 

(“WSH”) is of paramount importance to us. We firmly 

believe that work progress cannot be achieved at 

the expense of safety. Management sets the tone 

by defining and enforcing clear WSH management 

guidelines, fostering a safe and conducive working 

environment. 

We place great emphasis on proper installation 

methods, fire and emergency safety compliance, 

maintenance of equipment and materials integrity. 

Qualified professionals such as engineers and 

technical supervisory staff are engaged to monitor 

construction progress and ensure that developments 

are built in accordance with building regulations 

and codes. All our employees and subcontractors 

are expected to meet King Wan’s high standards of 

quality, safety and sustainability for projects.

HEALTH AND SAFETY POLICIES

Our commitment to WSH is based on the belief that 

a good working environment not only makes our 

employees safer, but also enables them to focus 

better, enjoy high work morale, and increase their 

work productivity and efficiency. 

SAFETY COURSES AND TRAINING HOURS

We ensure that our employees are adequately 

orientated on site safety measures and regulations, 

in addition to being well-trained in WSH standards 

and regulations through WSH courses. Employees 

with designated job scope are also further assessed 

based on specialised requirements and sent for 

training in relevant courses. 

Our endeavour in achieving and maintaining high 

WSH standards sees King Wan putting in place a 

comprehensive Safety and Health management 

system, which has been certified in ISO 45001, 

ISO 9001:2015 and awarded with the bizSAFE Star 

accreditation.  

REGULAR HEALTH AND SAFETY MEETINGS 

During our regular project meetings, latest health 

and safety matters and reports on any related 

issue or incident are prioritised and promptly 

highlighted. Attendees are also constantly reminded 

to follow recommended safety measures and 

regulations. Relevant findings and new policies are 

communicated in a timely manner to the rest of the 

project team.

Our respective Project-in-charge will also carry out 

regular site safety inspections to ensure that WSH 

standards and measures are fully observed at all 

times.

In FY2020, we have achieved zero fatalities both at 

the corporate office and project sites. 

DELIVERING QUALITY AND STANDARDS 

The quality of our project determines how 

well we add value to our customers. It is our 

priority to deliver innovative green designs, high 

standards of workmanship without compromising 

on functionality or price. Established in 1989, 

CONQUAS is the industry benchmark for quality and 

workmanship standards of construction projects 

in Singapore. With an average CONQUAS score of 

97.03, King Wan’s score is significantly above the 

latest industry’s average of 89.2 obtained from BCA 

website.

LABOUR PRACTICES AND 

CONDUCIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT

We recognise our employees as the Group’s most 

important asset, vital to our business sustainability. 

We strongly believe that with fair remuneration, 

the provision of equal opportunities, and a culture 

of nurturing and empowering through training and 

development, our engaged workforce will be able to 

contribute positively to the Group. This process has 

been responsible for building a dynamic culture at 

King Wan. 

We have a Human Resource (“HR”) framework 

with goals and objectives to attract, retain and 

develop a motivated and modernised workforce. 

King Wan has a headcount of over 300 full-time employees for our Singapore operations. Currently, there are 

no part-time or temporary employees.

Our HR policies, which cover our employees from 

recruitment to retirement, are reviewed regularly to 

ensure relevance and effectiveness. We encourage 

our staff to provide feedback to help us align 

expectations and make decisions. 

One of our core values at King Wan is to perform 

our jobs at the highest level of integrity and 

professionalism. As such, we are fully committed 

to comply with all applicable Singapore local 

employment 

laws, 

regulations 

and 

training 

requirements stipulated by various agencies such as

Besides competitive remuneration, we take care 

of our employees through comprehensive welfare 

and benefits schemes, including but not limited to 

insurance coverage, medical and dental benefits for 

our full-time employees in Singapore. 

King Wan’s compensation packages are aligned with 

internal parity and market benchmarks. King Wan 

offers fair and competitive remuneration packages 

based on employees’ performance, and expected 

roles and responsibilities. This is to ensure that we 

remain competitive in attracting talent, which is key 

to our sustained growth. King Wan also has a well-

structured and open annual performance appraisal 

system which is reviewed periodically and enhanced 

to ensure open communication between employees 

and their reporting officers.

COMPETITIVE REMUNERATION

Remuneration 

is 

recommended 

by 

the 

HR 

Department and the respective HODs, and approved

FAIR REMUNERATION

by the Remuneration Committee which consists 

of members from King Wan’s Board of Directors. 

Compensation packages are benchmarked against 

market surveys to ensure relevancy of King Wan’s 

salaries to the industry and overall market. 

CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (“CPF”)  

SCHEME AND CONTRIBUTIONS

The CPF is a comprehensive social security savings 

plan which aims to provide working Singaporeans 

and Permanent Residents with a measure of 

financial security and confidence in their old age. CPF 

contribution is computed based on a percentage of 

the employee’s monthly salary and varies with the 

employee’s age.

PRO-FAMILY BENEFITS

King Wan provides benefits and adopts welfare 

practices in line with the Singapore government’s 

pro-family legislation. Parents whose children are 

Singapore Citizens at birth get to enjoy maternity 

leave of 16 weeks and paternity leave of two weeks 

respectively, as advocated by the government.

PERFORMANCE-BASED APPRAISAL

As an organisation committed to meritocracy, our 

rewards and compensation policies emphasise 

employees’ performance. This is judged not only 

based on what employees have achieved in the 

review period, but also on how it is achieved. 

Annually, our employees will receive performance 

and career development reviews. Our performance 

management process is reviewed periodically to 

incorporate employees’ feedback and enhancements 

to the system.

King Wan believes that in order for the Group 

to grow and stay relevant in this competitive 

business landscape, it is critical that we invest in our 

employees’ learning and development and equip 

them with knowledge and relevant skills to perform 

well in their jobs. The Group strives to develop 

our employees through training, job rotation and 

internal promotion opportunities. Training needs 

are identified and implemented at the start of each 

year. We encourage employees to take up relevant 

job-related skill courses.

Bash a Dash Event

For the third year running, our Recreational 

Committee brought our people together through 

fun activities that helped them see each other in 

a different light, and allowed them to connect in a 

different setting. Through a series of planned team 

bonding events that were fun and motivational, 

our teams developed skills like communication, 

planning, problem-solving and conflict resolution. 

The “Beach Bash-A-Dash’ at Sentosa in July 2019 

was one such event where team members worked 

together to learn how to achieve a unified purpose. 

Other than our teambuilding activities, we also 

incorporated teamwork activities into our daily 

routine. We have assembled mini think tank 

groups and appointed rotational leaders to be 

facilitators in organising an effective meeting. This 

greatly cultivates the team’s functionality and allow 

opportunities for growth both individually and as a 

group.
