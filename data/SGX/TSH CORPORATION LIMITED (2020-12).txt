BOARD STATEMENT 102-14 

Dear Stakeholders,  

On behalf of the board of directors (“Board” or “Directors”) of TSH Corporation Limited 

(“TSH”), I am pleased to present our first sustainability report for the financial year 

ended 31 December 2020 (“FY2020”). 

This Report is set out on a ‘comply or explain’ basis in accordance with Rule 711B and 

Practice Notice 7F of the SGX-ST Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist. It also draws 

on the internationally recognized framework, the Global Reporting Initiative’s (“GRI”) 

Sustainability Reporting Standards. 

The pandemic situation in 2020 has highlighted to us the importance of sustainability. 

The Board has considered sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation, and 

determined the material ESG factors and overseen the management and monitoring 

of the material ESG factors.  

We aim to inform our stakeholders about our sustainability efforts in a transparent and 

accountable manner. The report shares the Group’s strategies, policies, practices and 

performance in relation to material economic, environmental, social and 

governance (“ESG”) issues. We have identified 11 indicators that matter most to our 

business, internal and external stakeholders and will oversee the management and 

monitoring of these material ESG factors.  

These material issues are accounted for through the following five sustainability 

strategies.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

We believe in the creation of long-term economic value and consistent economic 

performance for the Group. 

The Group generates revenue primarily through our offering of premium whiskies and 

cocktails, and operating six outlets covering five distinct concepts, namely, Quaich 

Bar, The Other Room, The Other Roof, Copper and Signature Reserve.   

INTEGRITY 

The Board is committed to maintaining a high standard of corporate governance 

within the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) to achieve greater 

transparency and to protect the interests of its shareholders. 

Good corporate governance establishes and maintains an ethical environment in the 

Group, which strives to enhance the interests of the shareholders of the Company (the 

“Shareholders”). 

SUSTAINABILITY 

It is essential to practice responsible stewardship of the environment to safeguard our 

finite resources. The Group supports global sustainability efforts in building a clean and 

green city for all to live, work and play in. 

We remain conscious of our energy and water footprints and look for ways to reduce 

them while balancing our needs.  

HEALTH AND SAFETY 

We are committed to ensuring the quality and safety of our products. It is important 

to us that the quality of our food and beverage products is maintained from the 

sourcing, manufacturing and delivery.   

Additionally, with the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”), we have 

stepped up our controls and implemented safe management measures at our 

workplace. This is on top of our policies on health and safety that are in place to 

protect all employees.  

HUMAN CAPITAL 

Being in the food and beverage industry, human capital is one of our greatest assets. 

Our team had 54 employees (43 full-time employees, 5 permanent part-time 

employees and 6 hourly rate employees) as at 31 December 2020 and we strive 

towards taking care of and developing them.  

We provide learning opportunities and are constantly strengthening our human 

resource policies to ensure the retention and attraction of employees.

Quaich Bar at Waterfront Plaza was opened in 

2007 as Singapore’s first dedicated whisky 

concept and Quaich Bar at South Beach 

Avenue was opened in 2016.  

Each Quaich Bar stocks more than 200 

different whisky labels with an emphasis on 

boutique single malt Scotch whiskies, and a 

sizeable range of selections of world whiskies 

including American, Irish, Indian and South 

African whiskies. Food, snacks and other 

alcoholic beverages such as beer, wine and 

other spirits are also offered. 

 

The Other Room at Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel, 

opened in 2016, is a speakeasy-style cocktail 

bar with interior design inspired by the 

Prohibition era.  

The outlet offers over 300 in-house cask finished 

products, which is unique in Singapore. The 

outlet also finishes spirits with spices, roots, teas, 

herbs, fruits, barks and coffee to obtain 

uniquely balanced flavour combinations. In 

addition, the outlet also offers food, snacks 

and conventional alcohol. 

 



Our Presence 

 

The Other Roof at Ann Siang Hill, opened in 

2018, is an open-air rooftop café bar for the 

working crowd in the central business district.  

The outlet offers a menu that focuses heavily 

on integrating tea infusions into cocktails with 

over 400 in-house tea-finished spirits and other 

alcoholic beverages including champagne, 

wine, non-alcoholic tea beverages as well as 

food and snacks.  

 

Copper at Lanson Place, opened in 2018, is a 

whisky-themed café bar oriented to a younger 

whisky drinking audience.  

With the tagline “A Whisky Playground” and 

100 whiskies from around the world, the outlet 

is a more casual establishment compared to 

Quaich Bar, and the menu emphasises whisky 

cocktails and carafe serves rather than just 

neat whisky by the glass or bottle.  

 

We import the whiskies from boutique distilleries, independent bottlers and wholesalers as well as 

other spirits, wines and liquors for our own outlets. In addition, we distribute on a wholesale basis 

to those who wish to purchase whiskies in volume. In 2020, we started the online retail sale of 

whiskies.

Reporting Principles 102-46 

 

 

Materiality Review Process 102-46 102-47 

 

 

 

We applied the GRI reporting principles – stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability 

context, materiality and completeness – in defining the report content by considering 

the Group’s activities, impact and substantive expectations and interests of our 

stakeholders. 

 

 

After consulting our external consultants, the relevant topics and indicators that are 

covered in our Report were selected based on our review of the economic, 

environmental, social and governance impacts which were most significant and 

based on our consideration of the topics that our stakeholders are most concerned 

with, after continuous stakeholder engagement. 

The materiality assessment was subsequently endorsed by the Group’s Executive 

Sustainability Committee. 11 topic specific indicators from the GRI’s Sustainability 

Reporting Standards 2016, grouped into three main categories, were identified as 

relevant and material to the operations of the Group.

SOCIAL 

 

Being in the food and beverage industry, human capital plays an integral role in 

building the success of TSH.  

It is essential that our hiring practices are fair, merit-based, and non-discriminatory so 

that we can recruit people with the right knowledge and expertise to contribute to 

the growth of our business. More importantly, we need to build a conducive and 

harmonious working environment so that our employees continue to stay with us.  

We attract and retain our employees through some of the following examples:  

• 

Providing life insurance to all staff  

• 

Staff welfare through birthday celebrations, monthly bonding meals, 

experience tasting, curriculum activities on workdays, overseas trips and 

incentive lunches 

• 

Regular trainings  

• 

Empowerment of authority for each area of expertise (E.g. A bartender can 

recommend his/her speciality drinks to customers) 

The full breakdown of our employees by gender, region and age, retrieved from our 

HR software, is presented on pages 19 – 20.  

 

 

 

 

None of the employees are under the collective bargaining agreements.

Occupational Health and Safety 403-1 

 

 

As the safety of our employees is our top priority, policies and procedures are 

established to protect our employees from accidents.  

Additionally, with the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”), we have 

implemented a set of safe distancing measures to protect our employees and 

customers. This is also done as required by the Ministry of Health (“MOH”) and Ministry 

of Manpower (“MOM”). 

 

Safety Management Measures (COVID-19) 

In view of COVID-19, our priority is the health and safety of our workforce. We have 

stepped up our controls and implemented safe management measures at our 

workplace to ensure our workforce is being well taken care of.  

We aim to act responsibly to do what we can to prevent the further spread of the 

virus.  

These are some of the measures we implemented to provide a safe working 

environment and minimise risks of further outbreaks within the workplace. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



APPOINTMENT OF SAFE MANAGEMENT OFFICER (“SMO”) 

The SMO will assist in the implementation, coordination and monitoring of the system 

of Safe Management Measures at the workplace. 

ENSURE SAFE DISTANCING 

- 

Demarcate queue lines and ensure at least one-metre spacing between 

customers at areas such as entrances and cashier counters (e.g. through floor 

markers).  

- 

One-metre spacing must also be maintained between queues and seated diners. 

CONTACT TRACING 

- 

Ensure all guests scan SafeEntry QR code using a QR code scanner on a 

smartphone, using SingPass Mobile App, using the TraceTogether App or 

presenting the TraceTogether Token for scanning.   

- 

Limit workplace access to only essential employees and authorised visitors. 





OTHER MEASURES 

- 

Ensure that all employees, customers, delivery personnel and other onsite personnel put on 

their masks properly at all times, except when eating and drinking. 

- 

Ensure that common spaces and items, high-touch surfaces, and interactive components 

are frequently cleaned/disinfected.
