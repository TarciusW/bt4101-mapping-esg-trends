1. Corporate Development Update 

 

CIHL (Tianjin) Water Development Limited (“Tianjin Water” or “Company”) is an integrated water supply 

company involved in the processing of raw water and reclaimed water, distribution of treated water for 

industrial and domestic no-drinking uses, and the provision of engineering services to customers in Binhai New 

District in Tianjin City, China. The Company owns its own processing plants and distribution networks. Tianjin 

Water was established in September 2004 as a joint venture and as of 31 December 2020, owns and operates 

the Beitang Water Plant and the Xinhe Water Plant. 

 

The Beitang Water Plant is located near Beitang Reservoir, and takes in raw water from Beitang Reservoir as 

well as Huanggang No. 1 Reservoir and Huanggang No. 2 Reservoir. Beitang Water Plant commenced 

operations in March 2006. The water treated by Beitang Water Plant complies with the standard of 

non-drinking water for urban residential and industrial uses (“城市污水再生利用、城市杂用水水质标准”).  

 

The Xinhe Plant, completed in 2019, is located in the Industrial Development Zone for Tianjin Binhai Hi-tech 

and New-tech, and is designed to treat the water discharged from a third-party-owned sewage treatment plant 

to the standard of Tianjin Municipal Standard Class One A. Part of the treated water is discharged into 

environment and the rest is further treated to the standard of reclaimed water suitable for industrial and 

domestic non-drinking uses, using UF+RO processing technology. The reclaimed water is fed into the network 

of pipelines owned by Tianjin Water and sold to customers. 

 

The Company’s network of pipelines covers the core area of Tianjin Binhai New District (天津滨海新区), which is 

located between Haifang Road in the East and Tangjin Expressway in the West. It covers Beitang Hi-tech Zone, 

Tanggu Ocean Hi-tech Zone, Dongxigu Area, Xiangluowan Business District, Lingang Economic Zone, Tianjin Port 

Bulk Cargo Logistic Centre, Central New Town North District, Tianjin Avenue area, South New Town. It will be 

further developed in accordance with the urban development plans of the service area, which is approximately 

300 square kilometers in size. Since its establishment, the Company through its water treatment services has 

contributed greatly to the development of Tianjin Binhai New District (天津滨海新区). 

 

Xinhe Water Plant 

 

Tianjin Water successfully completed the whole project by the end of 2019. The project comprises two 

processes. The first process is to treat discharged water from a third party sewage treatment plant. This 

treatment is necessary to enable the discharged water to meet the newly implemented Tianjin Municipal 

Standards before discharging. The second process is to further treat the dischargeable water into re-usable 

water so that the treated water can be reused for industrial and domestic uses. The plant occupies an area of 

20,016 square meters. 

 

Beitang Water Plant 

 

During 2018, the Beitang Water Plant has started to take water from the Huanggang No.2 Reservior as the 

Beitang Reservior, the previous source of raw water for the plant, had been reclassified by the government as 

water resources protection zone.  

 

It is noteworthy that, since the commencement of commercial operation of Xinhe Water Plant, the use of raw 

water has decreased dramatically. This is because the reclaimed water from Xinhe Plant uses the treated 

sewage water instead of raw ground water. This switch of source from raw ground water to reclaimed sewage 

water is a great contribution to a better environment.

2. Current Operations 

By the end 2020, Beitang Water Plant has reached daily production capacity of 100,000 cubic meters (m3) per 

day. The Xinhe Water Plant has achieved operational capacity of 70,000 m3 per day for discharging treatment 

and 50,000 m3 per day for reclaimed water. During the year, the network of pipelines increased by 53.6 

kilometers, to reach a total network size of 447.55 kilometers, serving 534 corporate and commercial 

customers. 

 

In 2020, the Group supplied a total of 16,411,500 cubic meters of water to its customers. The total area of 

plants and greenery watered by the water from our network has increased by 0.35 million square meters to 

reach 24.208 million square meters. Water used for watering plants and greenery was about 2.495 million m3, 

accounting for 15.21% of total water supplied by the Company. 

 

In 2020, the total number of residential customers served by the Company increased by 6,605 to about 108,000 

homes. Residential consumption reached 1.451 million m3, and accounting for 8.84% of total water supplied in 

the year. 

 

In 2020, the number of office and commercial users increased by 21, with total consumption of 0.428 million 

cubic meters of water, accounting for 2.61% of total water supplied. 

 

In 2020, the total number of industrial customers remains at 19. Water supplied to industrial users amounted 

to 12.037 million m3, accounting for 73.34%.

7. Impact of Covid-19 

The outbreak of Covid-19 took place in Wuhan, Hubei Province, at the end of 2019. Its impact on the Company 

was only felt around the Chinese New Year in late January 2020. Throughout the whole 2020, the Company has 

maintained continuous supply of water to customers. Water usage has declined in the first half of the year due 

to slower pace of activities of our customers, resulting from the shutdown of many sectors of the local 

economy, but rebounded in the second half. The Company complies with all government regulations for the 

utility industry. After receiving government approval in April, the Company has resumed the engineering and 

construction work throughout the rest of year. The operation of engineering and construction and the 

accommodations of workers are now subject to strict hygienic and social distancing requirements. There has 

been no infection involving our employees and their families.
