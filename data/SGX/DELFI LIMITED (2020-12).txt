GRI DISCLOSURE INDEX 

&lt;102-1&gt; &lt;102-14&gt; &lt;102-29&gt; &lt;102-32&gt;

The Board of Delfi Limited (“Delfi”) is pleased to present Delfi’s fourth Sustainability 

Report. This report provides greater insight into Delfi’s on-going commitment towards 

sustainability.

At Delfi, we firmly support the United Nations’ view that sustainable development is:

‘DEVELOPMENT THAT MEETS 

THE NEEDS OF THE PRESENT 

WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE ABILITY 

OF FUTURE GENERATIONS TO MEET 

THEIR OWN NEEDS1’

The Board of Delfi therefore considers sustainability a core part of the 

Company’s long-term strategy and works closely with Management in shaping 

our policies and practices. Together we have determined what we call our “Four 

Sustainability Pillars”. These represent our holistic approach not only towards 

sustainability but also to encompass our overlapping environmental, social and 

governance (“ESG”) objectives.

The Four Sustainability Pillars are the themes of social, environmental, 

economic and governance issues. The Board of Delfi, through the specially 

constituted Market Sustainability and Strategy Committee (“MSSC”), plays a 

crucial role in overseeing the management and monitoring the Company’s 

work in this regard.

Through the Four Sustainability Pillars we believe that we are able to address 

the needs and sometimes conflicting demands of our various stakeholders: Our 

employees. Our community. Our customers. Our consumers. Our investors.

In creating value for these stakeholders today, Delfi believes in being responsible 

and acting responsibly for the needs and aspirations of future generations 

of stakeholders. Delfi has been creating value for 68 years by creating jobs, 

livelihoods and profits, by producing enjoyable products, and paying taxes. And 

doing all this in a way which respects the communities and environment in 

which we operate.

This year’s Sustainability Report includes an additional section on the 

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”). We have elaborated on our mindset, 

planning, approach and initiatives taken on pages 11 to 14.

Our Sustainability Report complements Delfi’s other customary and regulatory 

financial and corporate governance disclosures in our Annual Report. It focuses 

on the ESG aspects of Delfi’s organisational performance in accordance 

with the Singapore Exchange Limited (“SGX”) Listing Rules 711A and 711B 

for Sustainability Reporting. Sustainability Reporting enables Delfi to provide 

transparency on our business in the context of its potential material impact on 

sustainability, alongside a phased disclosure of our performance with insights 

into the opportunities and challenges ahead.

BOARD STATEMENT

WE CARE AND ARE ALWAYS WITH YOU

At the bedrock of our organisation, are the Four 

Sustainability Pillars which focus on our social, 

environmental, economic and governance objectives. 

Together this provides a framework within which we 

can formulate our approach to sustainability. With the 

conviction of growing with our communities and the 

world, the overarching concept of sustainable value 

creation underpins all that we do. Akin to the cocoa 

tree, sustainable growth can be achieved when both 

our internal and external environments offer an optimal 

condition for us to thrive. Our key stakeholders are the 

identified people and groups that can significantly affect 

or be significantly affected by our organisation. As we 

flourish, our influence and impact on our stakeholders 

widens as well. The challenge therein, is for us to 

consistently propagate the fruits of our labour through 

value creation, meeting their needs and expectations.

Delfi is one of South East Asia’s leading players in branded chocolate confectionery. 

Headquartered in Singapore and listed on the Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange 

Limited (“SGX”) since 2004, our principal activities are marketing and distribution of our 

own brands of chocolate confectionery products in our core markets namely Indonesia, 

the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia. In addition to our own products we also market 

and distribute a broad portfolio of reputable agency brands to leverage on our multi-

layered distribution networks.

Our business is supported by two manufacturing facilities located in Indonesia and 

the Philippines. Our network comprises third-party distributors, sub-distributors and 

wholesalers and extends across a wide range of traditional and modern trade retail 

channels – from corner shops and mini-marts, to supermarkets and hypermarkets. Delfi 

has been in existence for 68 years, and since our humble beginnings in 1952, we have 

been creating value for all our stakeholders by creating jobs, livelihood and income. Value 

creation is our primary responsibility, which we intend to fulfil for many generations to 

come.

OUR BRANDS

&lt;102-2&gt; &lt;102-7&gt;

Our main product categories are moulded chocolate, dragées, enrobed wafers, wafers 

and biscuits. We have a portfolio of over 11 master brands and more than 40 sub-brands 

that extend across a broad spectrum of categories in the chocolate confectionery market.

Our established portfolio of brands in Indonesia includes “SilverQueen”, “Ceres” and 

“Selamat”, which were introduced in the 1950’s and “Delfi” in the 1980’s. In the Philippines, 

our flagship brands are “Goya” and “KnickKnacks”, which were introduced in the 1950’s 

and the 1980’s respectively. With our longstanding presence and legacy in these 

markets, our chocolates have delighted many generations of Indonesians and Filipinos. 

To complement our current portfolio of brands, in 2018, we acquired the exclusive and 

perpetual trademark rights to the “Van Houten” brand name for consumer chocolate 

products for markets in Asia, excluding India, Korea and the Middle East.

BATTLING COVID-19

PROACTIVITY

Delfi has consistently maintained our preparedness for contingencies and “Black Swan” events 

that could potentially threaten our business, by annually updating and ‘mock testing’ our Group’s 

Business Continuity Plan (“BCP”). Having already worked through the challenges of SARS and MERS, 

Management kept a watchful eye on developments on what the world initially described as the ‘Wuhan 

virus’ in December 2019. It soon became clear to us as events unfolded that it was timely to activate our 

BCP and we raised our alert level to Level 1 on 21 January 2020 ahead of governmental or regulatory 

prompting in the region. This was initiated before the virus emerged in South East Asia. 

EARLY RESPONSE – THE GROUP EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE (‘GEMC’)

Our early adoption of the Level 1 alert status helped drive (a) heightened alert levels, and (b) immediate 

implementation of planned and documented measures, such as (i) allowing only controlled or approved 

travel between countries, (ii) safety precautions when travelling, (iii) restricted and/or protective and 

preventive measures in meeting visitors and guests, (iv) monitoring health and travel declarations for 

staff and visitors alike, and (v) self-imposed ‘stay-home’ restriction for staff who returned to their home 

countries after travelling. 

The early response enabled our GEMC to provide weekly and sometimes daily guidance to our 

respective Country Emergency Management Committees (“CEMCs”) in shoring up their resources, 

capabilities and defenses in the fight against COVID-19. It also allowed the respective Country CEMCs 

to provide feedback on their response to the anti-COVID-19 measures, and for our GEMC to provide 

timely advice and direction. 

All staff were promptly advised to avoid any travel to Wuhan, China and/or named Middle East 

countries. If travel to the countries cited was necessary for the business, they were asked to consult 

their immediate superiors before traveling, so that the necessary precautions could be taken both 

before they left and upon their return to work. A 14 or 21 day ‘Stay-Home Notice’ and ‘Work-From-

Home’ option would normally be imposed on staff who travelled as well as those who were in direct 

contact with them. As the virus spread in South East Asia and larger parts of the world internationally, 

we gradually expanded our defensive and protective measures.

CARING THROUGH PROMPT ACTION – (A) SPLIT TEAMS AND (B) 

TELECOMMUTING

As the number of COVID-19 cases started to emerge and climb progressively 

in South East Asia, the GEMC decided that it was time to act swiftly with 

clear and concrete steps to protect our staff and our business. From 19 

March 2020, our GEMC activated split teams across departments within 

Delfi, and where practicable the ‘Work-From-Home’ option was adopted 

by staff. Shortly after that, our GEMC and CEMCs collectively adopted the 

Level 2 alert status, which required stricter measures in observing the split 

team protocol, and most, if not all staff who could work from home were 

required to do so. 

Our Group BCP provided that depending on the extent of a business 

interruption, if any, the alert status could be upgraded immediately so 

that our response may be timely and customised to meet and address the 

threat or potential business interruption. Our objective would be to achieve 

‘business as usual’ insofar as this is reasonably possible and practicable. 

STAFF WELL BEING AND SAFETY – A TOP PRIORITY

Delfi invested more than US$1 million in operational upgrades, medical and 

safety equipment, and personal protection equipment (“PPE”) including 

gloves and hazmat suits for our staff. Our Management’s top priority has 

always been the well-being and safety of staff involved in the production, 

distribution, marketing and sales functions, and the anti-COVID-19 

measures recommended and adopted by our Group are always targeted at 

keeping staff safe and healthy. 

94 Delfi employees had unfortunately contracted COVID-19 in the past year. 

They were detected and immediately isolated through our safety nets and 

processes put in place. We ensure that all affected staff continued to enjoy 

their income and benefits, as they received medical attention to aid in their 

recovery and return to their normal lives. Overall, appropriate measures and 

initiatives have been taken to ensure that our staff well-being is protected 

and operations are carried out safely and with thought to ensure continuity 

of our business.

BATTLING COVID-19

TEAM SAFETY – ENHANCED BY “COMPARTMENTALISATION”

Staff were divided into separate teams at the Delfi headquarters and country subsidiary 

company level. Our confectionery production teams went a step further, to ensure that 

the respective teams were further ‘compartmentalised’. For example, if Team A has 35 

people on a production line, Team A would be further sub-divided into separate sections 

(i.e. compartmentalised), so that even though they belonged to the same team, their 

work flow, systems, processes and supporting physical structures would be separated 

by using materials such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or acrylic panels (in their respective 

work stations) and this would enable them to function and operate as separate and 

independent sections. 

One of the key advantages or benefits of compartmentalisation, was that in our Team 

A example of 35 people, only 7 to 12 members of Team A may be subject to a 14 day 

quarantine or Stay-Home-Notice, in the event that any one of them was infected with 

COVID-19, or if a Team member came into contact with a COVID-19 positive patient, and 

not the whole team of 35. 

QUALITY AND CUSTOMER CARE

All the initiatives taken thus far have allowed Delfi to ensure that our operations, 

production, distribution and sales would be kept safe and protected from COVID-19. 

This has enabled us to continue our promise of providing products of quality and safety 

to our staff, distributors and consumers alike. 

THE DELFI MINDSET AND STRONG SUPPORT FROM MANAGEMENT

Delfi’s tenacity in adopting the mindset and approach towards the fight against COVID-19 

is as important as the actual measures and steps taken. In essence, the courage and 

commitment of our Management and staff in making big decisions early has increased 

the chances of these measures being a success. 

Our Management’s focus and drive has been primarily on, (I) keeping all staff safe 

through a range of activities such as (a) the use of ‘split-team’ arrangements, (b) team 

‘compartmentalisation’, (c) staggered working hours, (d) modified or customised 

schedules to enhance safe distancing, (e) the use of PPE, (f) thermal scanners for early 

detection, and (g) frequent sanitisation as a preventive measure; (II) working in partnership 

with staff to ensure that production is kept running to fulfil market demand in Indonesia, 

Malaysia, and the Philippines, and (III) ensuring that all those who can work from home 

adopted this option.

CONTACT TRACING 

Delfi’s GEMC and the respective CEMCs monitor the use of contact tracing diligently. 

In the event that information emerges that a relative or a close associate (of one of our 

staff) from the same household is suspected of or has contracted COVID-19, the staff 

concerned would be put on an immediate quarantine or ‘stay-home’ notice, and be sent 

for the required COVID-19 test. He or she would only come back to work upon the expiry 

of the quarantine or stay-home notice period and the passing of the COVID-19 test. 

In addition, other employees within our factory or office who have been in close proximity 

to or in close contact with the staff in question would also be placed on a stay-home 

notice for the required period, to ensure that they as well as the respective teams or 

departments in which they belong to are kept reasonably safe. 

PREPARING FOR THE ‘NEW NORMAL’

The initiatives and steps taken have enabled Delfi to prepare for the ‘New Normal’ scenario 

post COVID-19. The operations and processes at our factory, offices, external warehouses 

and marketing and distribution points had to be re-designed to prevent the spread of 

the virus amidst implementing safety measures. Our constant state of preparedness may 

be said to be the ‘New Normal’. Management has continuously looked to improve the 

efficiency of our manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sales operations, as well as 

work on our e-commerce initiatives and platforms which are currently work-in-progress.

BATTLING COVID-19

OUR PARTNERS AND ASSOCIATES 

As we navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges it brought with it, Delfi is 

committed to the safety and well-being of our distributors and associates. Preventing 

the spread of the virus is paramount. We have implemented additional protocols and 

measures for our associates in essential facilities and those who are working at home.

THINKING OF THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE 

Delfi reached over 18,000 people in South East Asia by putting together chocolate, 

confectionery, local delights and other snacks, together with face masks and hand 

sanitizers into what we called “Delfi care-packs”. These were given to healthcare workers 

and frontline staff at various hospitals, medical centres and healthcare institutions in 

Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore, in recognition of those who put 

themselves at risk daily in the fight against the pandemic. 

In our bid to contribute to and render support to the community at large, especially those 

who are in need and those who are likely to be most affected by the adverse financial 

impact and effects of a prolonged pandemic, we contributed S$100,000/- to the Straits 

Times School Pocket Money Fund. We did this in the hope that our modest contribution 

would somehow alleviate some of the potential pain or hardship that any student may 

have to go through if he or she did not have access to the Pocket Money Fund.

PROFILE OF OUR WORKFORCE

&lt;102-7&gt; &lt;102-8&gt;

People are at the heart of our organisation. As of 31 December 

2020, we had a total of 4,012 employees across Singapore, 

Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia, of which 2,688 were hired 

on a permanent contract basis. The average length of service of 

our permanent staff is about 10.8 years. We hire based on merit 

and are committed to upholding fair employment practices. 

No form of discrimination has any place in our organisation 

and we believe strongly in providing our people with equal 

opportunities and benefits for them to reach their full potential. 

We are compliant with all relevant labour laws and regulations 

in the countries in which we operate. Due to the nature of the 

manufacturing industry, a large number of roles tend to be more 

physical, which explains the higher percentage of males within 

our workforce. The semi-seasonal nature of our work also 

accounts for the use of temporary workers.

&amp; TARGETS



At Delfi, we believe that effective human resource policies should encompass all aspects from strong 

hiring practices, employee performance and employee conduct.

Our Hiring &amp; Human Resource (HR) Management policy is in place to ensure that we hire the appropriate 

number of individuals with the right expertise to ensure the smooth operation of the organisation. In 

addition, we strongly adhere to the principle of non-discriminatory hiring. For employees, we conduct 

periodic performance reviews to ensure that every individual has a fair and equitable chance to progress 

within the organisation and is given room for personal development.

Delfi has a strong Business Ethics &amp; Integrity policy that guides employees on their conduct to ensure that 

there is no conflict of interest between the employee and the company. Additionally, Delfi has an anti-

sexual harassment policy and a code of conduct that promotes racial and religious harmony, as well as 

anti-bullying, to ensure that such behaviours are not tolerated at the workplace. 

We comply with all relevant labour laws and regulations.

POLICY

EMPLOYEE WELL-BEING

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT

&lt;103-1&gt;

Having sound human resource policies and practices are critical 

to our organisation. It is important that all our staff are treated well 

and fairly. It also allows Delfi to attract and retain the right talent 

to foster growth, development, creativity and value creation. We 

understand that having the right individual in the right position 

can have a profound impact on the performance of the Group 

and generate value. We acknowledge that our continued 

success is based on the commitment and joint effort of our 

employees. Similarly, we recognise that the provision of equitable 

opportunities for personal development and career advancement 

on top of tailored training to allow our employees to effectively 

discharge their duties in a safe manner are of equal importance 

in ensuring the well-being of our employees and further, helping 

them to fulfil their potential.

New Hires and Turnover2

&lt;401-1&gt;

There was sufficient manpower to meet our core operational 

needs during the year. However, to meet anticipated surges 

in demand during yearly festive periods such as Ramadan 

and Christmas, temporary workers are recruited which 

often include rehiring those familiar with Delfi’s operations 

and those with a preference for such short-term contracts, 

thereby accounting for the overall turnover rate and 

correspondingly, new hire rate of 49.9%. Our permanent 

staff turnover rate was at about 9.5% for 2020.

Employee benefits

&lt;401-2&gt;

Delfi cares about its people. Beyond rewarding employees 

with remuneration that is commensurate with the efforts 

and performance delivered in helping the business achieve 

its goals, Delfi is invested in the well-being and morale of 

our employees. In our belief that happy employees will in 

turn raise productivity and efficiency, Delfi offers a range of 

employment benefits tailored for our full-time employees. 

Apart from the provision of baseline benefits mandated 

by respective local labour regulations, the HR team works 

closely with the country units in reviewing the non-monetary 

performance-based rewards and programs offered. Our 

benefits package may include life insurance, medical care 

benefits, disability coverage, parental leave and retirement 

provisions. We only partner with globally-recognised and 

reputable third party medical and financial organisations, 

with the aim to provide quality healthcare services and a 

holistic coverage for our employees.

3 

The total turnover rate of 45.1% illustrated above per the GRI 

rules, was driven largely by temporary short-term contract 

workers and part-time workers, who prefer not to be bound 

by long-term or permanent contracts.

In COVID-19 times, our top priority has always been the well-being and safety of our 

employees, and the anti-COVID-19 measures recommended and adopted by our Group 

are aimed at keeping our staff safe and healthy. As far as possible, we ensure that employees 

who can work from home are adopting the telecommute option. Other strategies 

implemented include the use of ‘split-team’ arrangements, ‘compartmentalisation’, 

staggered working hours and modified or customised schedules to enhance safe distancing. Further, initiatives and steps 

such as re-designing of entry and exit points have been implemented at our offices, factories, external warehouses and 

marketing and distribution points to curb the spread of the virus in preparing for the ‘New Normal’. More information can 

be found under the “Standing Together with Staff, Stakeholders and Friends to Fight COVID-19” section of this report.

We are committed to offer a healthy working environment and strive towards a healthy workforce. We aim

Our workforce is the heart of our operations, and their health and safety is of utmost importance. We 

meet and strive to exceed the relevant occupational health and safety standards. Our internal OHS policy 

aims to eliminate workplace hazards and prevent occupational illnesses in compliance with the applicable 

laws, regulations and other requirements.

In Indonesia’s factory site, our employees are also covered by an International Organisation for 

Standardisation (ISO) 45001:2018 certified OHS Management System which is internally and externally 

audited on an annual basis.

POLICY

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT

&lt;103-1&gt;

At Delfi, a safety culture is deeply rooted in our organisation and 

everything we do. Our ultimate aim is for zero accidents. As such 

we place great emphasis on Occupational Health and Safety 

(OHS). We are fully aware that in our workplace we are responsible 

for the health and safety of our employees. We therefore carefully 

and constantly consider employee safety to prioritise what more 

can be done to avoid accidents. This includes proper training 

and identification of workplace hazards to ensure our employees 

acquire the necessary knowledge for the safe and hygienic 

performance of their duties. Another key issue is to provide our 

employees with appropriate protective measures, and enforce 

their use, so as to minimise risk of accidents and reduce their 

possible consequences.

PRACTICES AND PERFORMANCE 

&lt;103-3&gt; &lt;403-2&gt; &lt;430-3&gt; &lt;403-5&gt; &lt;403-7&gt;

As an employer, Delfi recognises that with optimisation of 

the work environment, we inevitably promote the mental and 

physical well-being of all people. In our ongoing pursuit to 

achieve an accident-free workplace, we commit ourselves to 

internal and external audits that enable us to identify violations 

and areas for improvement. We constantly encourage our people 

to flag any unsafe working conditions and practices across our 

operations. Comprehensive training and education programmes 

are conducted, in several languages including Bahasa Indonesia 

and Filipino to facilitate better understanding, awareness and 

expectations of our safety culture across all sites. Further to 

that, all employees are required to maintain a strict adherence 

to procedures when operating specific machines and equipment 

to safeguard them and their co-workers from any unexpected 

issues that may arise.

Access to Health Services

&lt;403-6&gt;

Delfi safeguards the physical and mental health of our employees by ensuring that health 

services are readily accessible. All employees are also covered under our group hospital 

and medical insurance plans, and undergo an annual medical check-up provided by 

certified healthcare practitioners. Regular announcements are made to remind and 

update employees of the health benefits that they are entitled to. Transport to medical 

facilities is arranged readily where necessary, while the Philippines manufacturing facility 

has an internal clinic manned 24/7 by qualified nurses during work-week operations to 

serve the needs of our employees.

Worker participation, consultation, and communication

&lt;403-4&gt;

All employees, including workers, supervisors and managers are involved in risk analysis 

processes. The Safety Committee, comprising of observers from both Management 

and workers, meets monthly to monitor recent safety performances and to discuss any 

recent incidents and implement any action plans to mitigate future occurrences. We 

also implemented the “Near Miss” system that encourages all employees to report near 

miss incidents they encounter such as unsafe conditions, acts and safety suggestions. 

Additionally, an initiative – “Safety Wednesday” has recently been launched as an avenue 

to encourage the communication and facilitation of ideas between staff and supervisors 

in a joint effort to build a safer work environment for all.

In our continuous bid to ensure a safe workplace and conducive environment for 

our employees, a new initiative - ‘Safety Wednesday’, was launched to complement 

efforts revolving around the existing safety awareness programme which awards 

points to employees for exemplary safety behaviour using the ‘Behaviour Based 

Safety Card (“BBS Card”).

‘Safety Wednesday’ aims to empower staff and encourage collaboration between divisions in developing 

ideas and make improvement decisions to work processes and to physical premises for the mitigation 

or prevention of occupational hazards. This has become an important avenue for staff to communicate 

any concerns and suggest ideas given their direct on-the-ground experience to enhance the work 

environment and experience for everyone.

Case Study:

Safety Wednesday

PERFORMANCE

&lt;403-8&gt; &lt;403-9&gt; &lt;403-10&gt;

Delfi targets the goal of being ‘accident free’ and in this direction, 

we have upheld our zero work related fatalities for FY2020. 

There were six recordable work-related injuries. At Delfi, we 

regard all cases as important. Documentation of the incident 

is detailed in a corrective action report post-investigation and 

subject to further review and approval by a Safety and Health 

Coordinator. Subsequent follow-up is conducted to ensure the 

implementation of corrective and preventive measures, such as 

activity-based audits, enhancement of Lock-out/Tag-out (LOTO) 

procedures and risk assessment training.

This year, the slight increases in injury rates, lost day rates and 

absentee rates correspond with the decrease in the number of 

working hours due to the unprecedented impacts of COVID-19 

on production capacity and precautions taken to reduce physical 

contact at our facilities. We will continue to assess the safety 

aspects of our facilities and stay proactive in the implementation 

of projects and initiatives to drive workplace safety results.

Consumer health and safety, and mindful consumption are a priority for Delfi. 

We are proud of our Food Safety Management System that we have designed, 

developed, and implemented to ensure compliance with international and local 

food safety standards and recommendations. 

Our policy on the quality of our products emphasises the following: 

 Consistency in quality

 Microbiologically safe

 No foreign materials and no contamination

 Hygienically packed and sealed

Our Food Safety Management System is certified in accordance with internationally 

recognised standards (e.g. the FSSC 22000 Food Safety System Certification is 

internally and externally audited on an annual basis.)

POLICY

CONSUMER HEALTH AND SAFETY, 

AND MINDFUL CONSUMPTION

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT

&lt;103-1&gt;

The food and beverage industry landscape 

continues 

to 

advance 

and 

evolve. 

Consumers today are calling for greater 

transparency in disclosure of raw material 

origins, employee welfare, food safety 

programs and processes. A sizeable group 

of consumers are now looking beyond 

the traditional concerns of food safety – 

the effects of food-borne contamination 

or immediate physical affliction. These 

individuals are increasingly mapping their 

buying decisions to potential long-term 

health and wellness impacts as well as 

the environmental impact of sourcing 

and 

manufacturing 

food 

products. 

Fuelled by these increasing stakeholder 

expectations, 

government 

regulations 

and innovation, the realities call for Delfi 

to sharpen its focus and awareness on 

consumer health and safety as a key 

sustainability matter.

As 

an 

established 

chocolate 

and 

confectionery company, Delfi strongly 

believes in having the social responsibility 

to promote mindful consumption of 

our products – especially in our young 

consumers. 

We 

continually 

allocate 

resources in food science research and 

product innovation to design a wider 

range of healthier treats for the world to 

enjoy.

In our commitment to provide healthier 

products for our customers, we are 

working to gradually switch to the use 

of natural food colouring, as well as, 

production of products with less sugar 

while also making sure that the taste

In 2018, the World Health Organization 

(WHO) 

announced 

its 

intention 

to 

eliminate the use of artificial trans 

fats, 

otherwise 

known 

as 

partially 

hydrogenated oils (PHOs), from the global 

food supply chain. They estimated that 

more than 500,000 deaths a year could 

be attributed to cardiovascular diseases in 

which trans-fat intake plays a significant 

role9. In light of the adverse impact caused 

by artificial trans fats, Delfi voluntarily 

committed to and achieved the removal 

of artificial trans fats across the full range 

of our manufactured products in 2019. 

This year, Delfi has begun exploring the 

incorporation of healthy ingredients such 

as grains and real fruits to provide added 

nutritional benefits for our consumers. 

We are also pleased to share the launch of 

our SilverQueen variant “SilverQueenVery 

Berry” which is filled with yoghurt, real 

fruit and natural colour.

Increased emphasis has been placed 

on the welfare of our consumers. We 

have 

since 

implemented 

additional 

layers of preventive measures across 

our production, distribution and sales 

processes, as guided by Delfi’s New 

Product 

Development 

and 

Quality 

Assurance Team as well as best practices 

in the market, to ensure the unwavering 

quality of our products which are fit and 

safe for consumption.

Delfi’s Food Safety Management System

As part of our overall Food Safety Management System, we have 

made significant investments in quality assurance systems in 

order to consistently achieve high manufacturing standards. The 

manufacturing standards which the Group follows include:

Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”)

GMP was established by the Food and Drug Administration in 

the USA in 1967 under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug 

and Cosmetic Act. The GMP is based on international hygiene 

standards and promotes a quality approach to manufacturing. 

GMP guidelines provide minimum requirements that a food 

product manufacturer must meet to ensure that the products are 

of high quality and do not pose any risk to the consumer or the 

public. The regulations are relatively general and allow the Group 

to decide individually how to best implement the necessary 

controls to achieve goals such as cleanliness, equipment 

verification and process validation. In doing this, the Group takes 

into account the specific needs of its consumers.

Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (“HACCP”)

HACCP was adopted by the Group as a comprehensive step-by-step food safety program for 

its production process. Assessments are made of the hazards applicable to microbiological, 

chemical, physical, food safety and quality standard risks. Based on such hazard assessments, 

the critical control points are determined within the production process to control identified 

hazards. Procedures for monitoring and taking corrective actions are established for each 

control point. Therefore, any problem is traceable to a specific point in the production process 

and/or the specific raw material utilised.

The Group conducts process testing to ensure the quality and specifications of our products 

are consistent and meet the exacting standards of our consumers. Such in-process testing 

involves performing tests on samples of products to determine if there are any quality defects. 

In addition, the Group conducts microbiological tests on samples to ensure that its strict 

specifications regarding microbiological content are adhered to so that its products are 

always safe for human consumption.

Each delivery of products is given a unique lot identification code printed on the individual 

packing and accompanying documents which incorporates the date of manufacture. It can 

be used to trace the complete production history of the product starting from the source of 

raw materials. Any delivery breaching the Group’s quality standards can thus be identified and 

stopped before it is delivered to its customers and consumers.

FSSC 22000 Food Safety System Certification

FSSC 22000 provides a framework for effectively managing the Group’s food safety 

responsibilities. FSSC 22000 is fully recognised by the Global Food Safety Initiatives (“GFSI”) 

and is based on existing ISO Standards. It demonstrates that the Group has a robust Food 

Safety Management System in place. The FSSC 22000 system uses a management systems 

approach to food safety, using ISO 22000 for the management system requirement and 

ISO Technical Standards or Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) for prerequisite program 

requirements. Our manufacturing facilities in Indonesia and the Philippines have successfully 

upgraded FSSC 22000 certification to version 5 in FY2020.

HIGH HYGIENE STANDARDS

Delfi observes high hygiene standards. Regular training and checks are 

conducted on our personnel at our facilities. These include stringent 

requirements on attire, footwear and personal hygiene.

INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY

We draw on innovation and technology to improve our food safety standards. 

For example, we have made significant strides in improving our packaging 

materials to strengthen protection against the external environment. We have 

also rolled out X-ray machines to enhance our foreign material detection 

systems across our facilities.

LABELLING AND COMMUNICATION

The display and provision of information on our products is important to our 

consumers as well as being the subject of many regulations. To that end, we 

strive to provide transparent access to reliable and accurate information on 

our products through responsible labelling. Our labels advise on the expiry, 

recommended storage conditions, allergen declaration, ingredients, nutritional 

value, etc. We continuously seek to improve the contents of our product labels 

with greater emphasis on the sustainability impact of our products.

CUSTOMER CARE PORTAL

We value feedback from our customers. We ensure that all customers and 

consumers can be heard through the launch of our customer care and feedback 

portal. In 2020, we have updated labels across all our products manufactured 

in Indonesia and the Philippines to bear the address of the portal (https://www.

delfilimited.com/custcare/ and/or https://www.vanhoutenchocolates.com/

custcare/). This provides a direct avenue for all customers to reach out to Delfi 

and is also a central system for the business to maintain an overview of the 

quality of the products, service delivery and feedback received.

PRODUCT STORAGE

Our prescribed standards and best practices for storage in our value chain, 

ensures that our products are safe and fit for human consumption, as well as 

fresh enough for our customers to enjoy our products.

In 2020, we have met our target of no incidents of material non-compliance 

with applicable laws and regulations for consumer health and safety as well as 

for product information and labelling.

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT

&lt;103-1&gt;

Energy is necessary for Delfi’s sourcing and production processes. 

As a responsible steward of the environment, Delfi recognises that 

optimising the use of our energy sources can reduce greenhouse 

gas emissions, and our actions can make an impact on the wider 

environment and play a part in combating wider environmental 

issues such as global warming and air pollution. Efficient energy 

usage remains key in our planning and operations, and we will 

continue to keep a close eye on our monitoring systems to 

ensure we do not use more than we need, reducing variable 

consumption where practicable. Delfi continually strives to 

seek opportunities to improve our energy efficiency across our 

business operations by exploring the use of energy efficient 

systems, products and technology.

ENERGY MANAGEMENT 

PRACTICES AND PERFORMANCE 

&lt;103-3&gt; &lt;302-1&gt; &lt;302-3&gt;

At Delfi, we believe there is an opportunity for us to be an environmentally-conscious 

contributor towards a more sustainable food system. Constant monitoring of 

consumption is done to ensure optimisation of the use of our energy sources. We have 

appointed certified energy managers with the relevant expertise to oversee and manage 

environmental matters and performance at our manufacturing facilities in Indonesia.

During the year, several retrofits were carried out in our commitment to reduce our 

energy consumption levels. They include the installation of inverters to control speeds of 

high capacity motors, replacement of fluorescent lamps with LED lamps and optimising 

our chillers with technologies that are more energy efficient.

At Delfi, sources of energy consumption come mainly from fuel in our manufacturing 

facilities in Indonesia and the Philippines, specifically electricity usage, liquified petroleum 

gas (LPG), bunker fuel oil (“BFO”) (Philippines only) and natural gas (Indonesia only). To 

that end, we have reduced the use of BFO significantly for a cleaner source of fuel, LPG, 

at our manufacturing facility in the Philippines, as LPG is a lower-carbon alternative.

In Indonesia, Delfi consulted industry experts in implementing an energy-saving system 

at our manufacturing facility. Energy consumed by us at the facility was reduced as a 

result.

In 2020, our total internal energy consumption, including both fuel and electricity usage, 

amounted to 90,246 mWh, a fall of 16% from the 107,747 mWh consumed in 2019. Our 

conservation efforts and established control procedures to limit unnecessary energy 

usage have contributed to the fall in energy consumption across both our manufacturing 

facilities, and we have also met our target of achieving a 5% reduction in total energy 

consumption.

On a per metric ton basis, the total amount of energy consumed for 2020 was 2.83 mWh/

MT, which was an increase of 19% from 2019. This increase was mainly due to a fall in 

production output across our manufacturing facilities due to the unprecedented impacts 

of COVID-19 as we prioritised strict compliance with safe distancing measures and split 

teams this year, resulting in inevitable inefficiencies in our operations. Delfi has already 

implemented several initiatives to mitigate the long-term impacts of COVID-19 (see 

“Standing Together with Staff, Stakeholders and Friends to Fight COVID-19”), and moving 

forward, Delfi will continue to invest in efforts to reduce our fixed energy consumption10.

10 Fixed energy consumption refers to consumption that occurs regardless of production output levels.

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT

&lt;103-1&gt;

As a responsible guardian and steward of the environment, Delfi 

practices responsible water usage. Water is precious in every 

sense of the word, for human life, the well-being of individuals 

and the health of the community as a whole. With this in mind, 

we at Delfi exercise utmost care in managing our access to and 

usage of water. We are conscious of using only what the Group 

needs and engage in recycling at every available opportunity so 

as not to strain the water supply or unnecessarily tap into the 

water-table. Delfi is careful in looking after the availability of this 

precious resource, at every step of the value-chain, so that this 

‘balance’ in the ecosystem is preserved, soothed and allowed to 

perform its functions for the people in the community and the 

environment at large. We are of the view that management of 

our water access and usage play a significant role in our role as a 

good corporate citizen.

PRACTICES AND PERFORMANCE 

&lt;103-3&gt; &lt;303-1&gt; &lt;303-2&gt; &lt;303-3&gt;

We seek to ensure that our operations use water11 responsibly and efficiently. We rely on 

locally-sourced groundwater (as well as the municipal water supply in the Philippines) 

for our needs, drawing water within the permissible daily limits granted by the relevant 

governing agencies. Recognising water is a precious and scarce resource in regions 

where we operate, we therefore continue to manage our water usage consciously and 

ensure that we do not use more than we need. When there is a surplus in our water 

storage, we would also share this with our neighbouring local community.

In 2020, the overall volume of water used amounted to 174,960 m3 in Indonesia and 

the Philippines, which was a 25% reduction from the 234,429 m3 consumed in 2019. 

Our Indonesia facility withdrew 155,643 m3 from groundwater amounting to 89% of the 

total water used, while the remaining 11% is attributed to our facility in the Philippines, 

with 607 m3 from municipal water supply and 18,710 m3 from groundwater. This 

achievement was largely due to conservation efforts and control procedures established 

to limit unnecessary water use during production at our facilities. More notably, our 

commitment to increase the use of treated water that has undergone processing by our 

wastewater treatment plant at our facilities continues to play a significant part in reducing 

our consumption from external sources.

On a per metric ton basis, the total volume of water used for 2020 was 5.48 m3/MT, which 

was an increase of 6% from 2019. This increase was partly due to a fall in production output 

across our manufacturing facilities due to the unprecedented impacts of COVID-19 this 

year, as well as, the implementation of increased frequency of disinfection and cleaning 

at our facilities as a form of prevention, which resulted in higher water usage per unit of 

production output. Delfi has already implemented several initiatives to mitigate the long-

term impacts of COVID-19 (see “Standing Together with Staff, Stakeholders and Friends 

to Fight COVID-19”), and moving forward, Delfi will continue to invest in efforts to reduce 

our water usage and safeguard this precious resource.

Beyond our customers, consumers and business partners, Delfi 

recognises the importance of enriching lives and building sustainable 

relationships with the communities in which we operate.

One of our key contributions is the supply of clean water (estimated 

at 70m3 per day) to the community living close to the factory in Indonesia. Water that is supplied to 

the surrounding communities undergoes treatment and meets the clean water standards of Indonesia - 

Permenkes 492 / MENKES / PER / IV / 2010. This ensures that water received by the local communities is 

potable and their basic welfare and needs are met.

TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL OF WASTE AND EFFLUENTS

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT

&lt;103-1&gt;

Waste and effluents management are critical for global 

sustainable development. Proper sanitation, clean water and air 

are important for human health and the environment. As part 

of the food processing sector, we understand the importance 

in managing and reducing the waste and effluents generated 

throughout our operations. For our communities to prosper and 

enjoy a high quality of life, we have to conscientiously monitor 

our discharge into the environment and seek to eliminate or at 

least reduce any ecological impact. It is thus vital to prioritise 

waste disposal methods that minimise any such impacts, such as 

reusing, recycling and recovery. Treatment of our effluents is also 

crucial in ensuring that hazardous substances do not leach into 

ecosystems and undergo bio-amplification along the food chain. 

Managing waste also brings about potential cost-savings to our 

organisation. Looking into resource efficiency in our production 

will enable us to create more with less and deliver greater value 

to our stakeholders.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH 

&lt;103-2&gt; &lt;103-3&gt;

12 Indonesia’s Program for Pollution Control, Evaluation, and Rating (“PROPER”) is a national-level public environmental reporting 

initiative. The objective of this regulatory tool is to promote industrial compliance with pollution control regulations, facilitate 

and enforce the adopt of practices contributing to clean technology, and to ensure a better environmental management 

system. The program uses a five colour-coded performance rating – gold (excellent), green, blue, red and black (poor).



We are committed to an efficient use of resources and reduction of waste and pollution. We seek to be 

fully compliant with all relevant laws and regulations.

In addition, we have the following targets:

&lt;303-4&gt;

We closely monitor our water discharge in both our manufacturing facilities in Indonesia 

and the Philippines. The wastewaters from our facilities are biologically treated and 

tested before being discharged into the city sewers or nearby rivers as freshwater. We 

utilise wastewater quality indicators to measure and ensure that wastewater quality is in a 

generally acceptable range13 before discharge into the natural environment. In Indonesia, 

our manufacturing plant is ISO14001 certified, and has been assigned a “Blue” (Adequate) 

rating under the PROPER scheme which promotes compliance with existing water 

pollution regulations. We are in progress towards achieving a “Green” (Good) rating by 

improving our environment management procedures beyond the expected compliance 

level.

Delfi has also implemented a Zero Processed Water Discharge project this year, focusing 

on recovery of processed water at both our Indonesia and Philippines manufacturing 

facilities. This project aims to ensure that 100% of the process wastewater produced by 

our facilities are treated and repurposed for use in toilets or gardening purposes.

In 2020, a total volume of 59,028 m3 water was discharged in Indonesia and the 

Philippines. Our Indonesia facility discharged 13,594 m3 into a treatment facility and 

35,582 m3 into nearby rivers. Our facility at the Philippines discharged 7,358 m3 into the 

city sewers and 2,494 m3 into a nearby river. The volume of water discharged in 2020 fell 

by 10% from 65,522 m3 in 2019.

On a per metric ton basis, the total volume of water discharged for 2020 was 1.85 m3/

MT, which was an increase of 28% from prior year. This increase was mainly due to a fall 

in production output across our manufacturing facilities driven by the unprecedented 

impact of COVID-19 as we prioritised strict compliance with safe distancing measures, 

split teams this year and more safety and hygiene practices, resulting in higher usage of 

water per unit of production output and some inevitable added costs to our operations. 

Delfi has already implemented several initiatives to mitigate the long-term impact 

of COVID-19 (see “Standing Together with Staff, Stakeholders and Friends to Fight 

COVID-19”), and moving forward, Delfi will continue to invest in efforts to better manage 

our water discharge volume. 

13 Generally acceptable ranges of our water quality indicators include Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) below 100 mg/litre, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) below 50 mg/litre, Total Suspended Solids 

(TSS) below 70 mg/litre, pH of 6.5 to 9.0, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) equal to or below 1,000 mg/litre.

Waste 

&lt;306-2&gt;

At Delfi, we ensure that our waste is safely disposed of to ensure that we do not 

contaminate our environment. All our waste is managed by authorised waste contractors, 

which is in line with regulatory requirements. The terms, hazardous and non-hazardous 

waste, are terms used in accordance with GRI Standards.

In 2020, the volume of overall waste amounted to 1,058,748 kg in Indonesia and the 

Philippines, a reduction of 18% from 1,291,283 kg in 2019. This fall in volume was achieved 

through close monitoring and a maintenance regime, to ensure optimal operating 

conditions.

On a per metric ton basis, the volume of overall waste for 2020 was 33.2 kg/MT, 

which was a 17% increase from the prior year. This increase was mainly due to a fall in 

production output across our manufacturing facilities due to the unprecedented impact 

of COVID-19 this year. Delfi has already implemented several initiatives to mitigate the 

long-term impact of COVID-19 (see “Standing Together with Staff, Stakeholders and 

Friends to Fight COVID-19”).

Non-hazardous waste consisted of packaging and production peripherals comprising of 

paper, plastic and metallic materials. In 2020, absorber waste, also known as residual waste 

sludge produced as a by-product of the wastewater treatment process, was assessed 

to be non-hazardous for our Indonesian manufacturing facility by the local authorities, 

the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry. Hazardous waste relates to waste 

from our analytical laboratory (e.g. laboratory chemicals) and maintenance activities (e.g. 

transformer oil).

In respect of our overall non-hazardous waste produced, which made up 99.2% of our 

total waste, 75.9% was recycled, 3.7% was accounted for through recovery, 2.2% was 

reused, 18.1% was composted and the remaining 0.1% was disposed by contractors in 

compliance with local regulations. Our hazardous waste, which amounted to 0.8% of 

our total waste, was managed and disposed of in compliance with local regulations by 

authorised waste contractors.

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT

&lt;103-1&gt;

At Delfi, we understand that agricultural practices can potentially bring about adverse 

environmental impacts. It is therefore a key objective for our sourcing function that all the 

agricultural products used are derived sustainably and purchased responsibly along our 

direct supply chain. Delfi practices due diligence in our operations in ensuring minimal 

adverse environmental impacts, such as engaging with partners who believe in the same 

sustainability agenda as we do, and continuously improving our sourcing approach to 

advance our sustainability vision. 

Details of the management approach, practices and performance are disclosed under 

the Supply Chain Assessment Section.

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT

&lt;103-1&gt;

Delfi is a responsible organisation – Through our value creation 

chain, our resources, materials and products move across borders 

from country to country on a daily basis. Any lapses or failures 

in compliance with import, export and trade regulations would 

directly impact our organisation and may lead to socioeconomic, 

civil or even criminal penalties. Non-compliance could also 

cause significant business disruption such as loss of business 

opportunities, custom clearance and shipment delays, container 

abandonment or government sequestration. Such disruptions 

would ripple across our organisation – affecting our production 

and delivery schedules, greatly impacting our stakeholders across 

the value chain and our brand reputation. On a financial level, 

these costs collectively would have a significant bearing on our 

financial bottom line.

PRACTICES AND PERFORMANCE 

&lt;103-3&gt;

Our cross-functional teams support one another in ensuring that 

our approach towards being fully compliant remains robust. We 

conduct regular internal meetings to update each other on any 

changes to the relevant laws and regulations at the local, national 

and international level. These laws and regulations are complex, 

dynamic and require close monitoring.

We work closely with Badan Pengawas Obat dan Makanan 

(‘BPOM’) Republik Indonesia and participate in BPOM’s focus 

group discussions for the formulation of regulations. This has 

strengthened our channels of communication with BPOM, 

providing us an official platform to directly engage and build on 

good sector practices shared in enhancing our compliance track 

record for food safety and quality.

In 2020, there were zero material incidents of non-compliance 

with applicable import, export and trade regulations.

OUR VALUES

&lt;102-16&gt;

Integrity, excellence and commitment, are values that guide all of 

us at Delfi as we seek to enhance our organisation’s development, 

performance and growth. These core values are embedded 

within our concept of corporate governance and form an integral

Our mission is to delight customers and consumers with superior 

chocolate confectionery products and services.

Delfi’s Code of Conduct provides a framework for ethical 

decision making and good conduct for the Group. The Code 

contains important core values and principles of the Company’s 

professional conduct and governance. The Board of Directors, 

Management and all employees are dedicated to upholding the 

Code.

GOVERNANCE

CODE OF CONDUCT

&lt;102-17&gt;

Delfi has an Ethics Code, within our Code of Conduct, to which advice on matters of ethical concerns and 

grievances may be sought by our internal and external stakeholders. These matters will be handled objectively 

and subject to further investigation, disciplinary action/s or legal process, where justified and necessary. A link to 

the Code may be found at http://www.delfilimited.com/NewsRoom/20190401-Code_of_Conduct-Delfi.pdf.

In addition, Delfi has a whistle blowing mechanism and policy that seeks to encourage reporting in good faith, of 

matters which may comprise misdemeanours, misconduct, fraud, corruption, illegal acts, etc. The mechanism 

and policy seek to provide for reporting in confidence that stakeholders are treated fairly and shielded from any 

reprisal.

In regard to issues relating to our ESG concerns, external stakeholders can also file their feedback, concerns or 

grievances through our general corporate relations channels. Internal stakeholders can do so through human 

resources / union-management channels. We seek to investigate, address and resolve all confirmed cases as 

soon as practicable. All grievance proceedings and records will be kept in confidence.

are convened to seek guidance from the Board or to elicit a decision. All Directors are expected to act in good 

faith, and to act in the interests of all Delfi shareholders. The Board is supported by the Executive Committee, the

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

Beyond our customers, consumers and business partners, Delfi recognises the importance of enriching lives and 

building sustainable relationships with the many communities we serve.

Delfi Limited Bursary

The Delfi Group believes that where possible we should support deserving students who are unable to achieve 

their academic potential just because they lack adequate funding. No person should be left behind for want of 

financial means to benefit from a good education. In the same vein, Delfi believes in the importance of nurturing 

and grooming the next generation as strong ethical leaders. Through the bursaries awarded to students of 

Singapore Management University (SMU), Delfi hopes to empower exceptional students to strive for excellence. 

There are 3 students on this programme for the academic year 2019/2020.

Delfi’s Milk Drinking Movement

Delfi partnered with an elementary school, Andir 01 Elementary School, in Bandung, Indonesia in September 2018 

to bring the Milk Drinking Movement (Gerakan Minum Susu) to life. The Milk Drinking Movement is expected to 

benefit the students in giving them their nutritional needs for growth. Our work under this movement is expected 

to be carried out monthly over a 3-year continuous period. To supplement our contribution to the children 

under this initiative, we try to liven the spirits of these children by providing them with additional chocolate treats 

to reward them for their efforts at school.

The initiative is in keeping with Delfi’s regulatory commitment with Indonesia’s Ministry of Agriculture, to help 

energise and contribute to the development of the domestic fresh milk industry locally. To spread the joy that 

Delfi’s Milk Drinking Movement brings, we have expanded our reach to include other schools in Bandung, 

Indonesia, namely, SDN Dayeuhkolot 07.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the Milk Drinking Movement has been put on hold this year to protect 

the health and safety of the people involved. We look forward to continuing this initiative in the years ahead.

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT

&lt;103-1&gt;

Securing socially and environmentally sustainable agricultural 

products is important to Delfi and our stakeholders. We recognise 

that our impact on people and the environment extends beyond 

our own business activities. These impacts can occur as a result 

of our business relationships throughout our supply chain. 

Therefore, due diligence is expected of Delfi in taking concrete 

steps to prevent and mitigate all forms of adverse social and 

environmental impacts that are directly linked to our operations 

and products. To that end, we seek to drive the sustainability 

agenda along our supply chain and collaborate with like-minded 

business partners to mutually advance our shared sustainability 

vision.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH  

&lt;103-2&gt;&lt;103-3&gt;



Our emphasis is to actively seek out and work with suppliers that support sustainable practices. Sustainability 

is a core criterion in our supplier evaluation, and we are continuously improving our procurement and 

sourcing approach to drive the sustainability agenda. 

Delfi’s Prescribed Standards, Requirements &amp; Practices comprise our minimum requirements relating 

to the Environment, Social &amp; Working Conditions, in purchasing products, materials and services. 

Our approach is based on international laws, regulations and the core conventions as defined in the 

fundamental principles of Human Rights at work, namely:

 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UN, 1948)

 Convention on the Rights of the Child (UN, 1989)

 ILO Declaration (ILO, 1998)

 The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (UN, 1992)

 The Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact Framework (UN, 2000)

 The Johannesburg UN World Summit on Sustainable Development (UN, 2002)

Delfi has a sustainable sourcing strategy for the acquisition of raw materials that is aligned with UTZ 

certification requirements.

POLICY



We are committed to sustainable procurement and in promoting positive socioeconomic and 

environmental impact through our supply chain.

In addition, we have the following targets:

PRACTICES AND PERFORMANCE 

&lt;103-3&gt;&lt;308-1&gt;&lt;414-1&gt;

Delfi Limited’s Prescribed Standards

We urge all our partners and suppliers to uphold the Delfi Limited’s Prescribed Standards, Requirements and Practices for the Environment, Social and Working Conditions (“Delfi’s 

Prescribed Standards”).

We recognise that our business has an impact on people and the environment locally, globally and especially in the countries in which we operate and do business in. We believe that 

we are empowered to choose to act responsibly, with integrity and to do good while fulfilling our intent of being a good business partner. Upholding this principle is a pre-condition 

to our future growth; a growth that will be achieved along with other like-minded responsible business partners and suppliers who share and identify with our vision, mission and 

approach to doing business.

As a result, Delfi requires business partners and suppliers to acknowledge and agree to our Delfi’s Prescribed Standards, for the Environment, Social &amp; Working Conditions for the 

management of businesses, the purchase, and/or acquisition of products, materials and/or the delivery of services. Ultimately, it is the spirit of the Delfi’s Prescribed Standards that is 

important to us, and it is with this spirit that we consistently urge our business partners and suppliers to stand shoulder to shoulder with us in upholding the Delfi’s Prescribed Standards. 

Likewise, in our bid to uphold ethical business practices and supply chain transparency, Delfi’s Indonesia facility undergoes yearly SMETA audit, which is an ethical audit format 

which reports on the Sedex pillars of Labour, Health and Safety, Environment and Business Ethics. Delfi is a member of Sedex – one of the world’s leading ethical trade membership 

organisations.

The following table summarises the elements covered in the Delfi’s Prescribed Standards.

In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 crisis, Delfi remained cognizant and alert to the potential adverse impact to the supply chain. As such, Delfi implemented practices and 

procedures to ensure efficient stock and raw materials management and control, keeping a watchful eye on key ingredients, and where appropriate or necessary nurturing or keeping 

‘back-up’ supplies and suppliers who would be able to meet our needs. We did this to stay ahead of the curve. There was no material negative or adverse impact on our supply chain 

as a result of COVID-19.

LAUNCH OF SUPPLIER SELF-ASSESSMENT (“SSA”) 

PROGRAM

Aside from Delfi’s Prescribed Standards that our suppliers are 

encouraged to adhere to, we have rolled out the SSA program 

which incorporates social and environmental criteria as part of 

our evaluation matrix used to assess new potential suppliers, 

as well as our existing suppliers in a phased-approach on 

their compliance and competence in managing ESG-related 

aspects across their value chain. The SSA questions are based 

on internationally recognised standards such as but not limited 

to ISO14001 Environmental Management Systems, SEDEX 

membership and OSHAS, whilst taking into consideration the 

respective countries’ environmental conservation laws to assess 

suppliers on their attitude towards environmental and social 

responsibility.

In 2020, 100% of our new suppliers have completed the SSA. We 

are still in the process of assessing our existing suppliers using the 

revised SSA, in line with our phased approach.

UTZ CERTIFICATION

UTZ is an internationally renowned certification program for sustainable farming of coffee, tea, cocoa and 

hazelnuts, and it affirms to consumers that products have been sourced in a sustainable manner. The program 

is part of the Rainforest Alliance, an international non-profit organization that aims to protect forests, promote 

the rights of farmers and forest communities, and adapt to the climate crisis by making responsible business the 

new normal.

To demonstrate our commitment towards better and more sustainable supply chains, Delfi obtained the 

UTZ certification in 2020. The UTZ certification is helpful in that it is an assurance from an independent non-

governmental organisation that Delfi has a sustainable sourcing strategy for the acquisition of raw materials. 

Delfi would also be able to show that it is able to supply UTZ certified products to some customers.

SUSTAINABILITY PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES

Delfi believes in collaborating with businesses, communities, governments and non-governmental organisations 

(‘NGOs’) to tackle systemic sustainability concerns that may be prevalent in our sector. So, for example, in the 

chocolate industry and the cocoa ingredients industry, it is imperative that we do our part in helping to address 

these concerns and work against known ills such as child labour, forced labour, human rights violations, cruelty 

against animals, deforestation, and pollution, while we also focus on promoting good policies and practices in 

employment, health, safety and governance.

 Determine the process 

principles of our materiality 

assessment

 Cross-functional focus group 

discussions and interviews 

were conducted to consider 

sustainability from both internal 

and external stakeholders’ 

perspective



 Based on our stakeholder 

engagement and drawing 

from insights on our internal 

and external value drivers, a 

comprehensive universe of 30 

potential material sustainability 

matters was identified



 Facilitated by independent 

consultants, a materiality 

assessment workshop was 

conducted in FY2017

 In FY2018 abd FY2019, we 

reviewed the materiality 

matrix to ensure continued 

relevance to our business and 

stakeholders

 In FY2020, we identified energy 

management as a new material 

matter



 The reviewed materiality matrix 

was validated by the Board of 

Directors for reporting in this, 

our fourth sustainability report

At Delfi, we believe that our Sustainability Mission is built on the four intertwined themes of social, environmental, economic and governance issues which we 

call our “Four Sustainability Pillars”. The sustainability matters within each of these Pillars are the ones that we have focused on as we believe them to be the 

most relevant to our business and our key stakeholders.
