Sustainability is a key consideration in formulating business strategy at Ramba Energy

Limited (“REL”) and we are pleased to issue our first Sustainability Report prepared in

line with the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”) guidelines.

The report aims to provide a

balanced perspective of our efforts, goals and ambitions towards becoming a responsible

corporate citizen.

The Board oversees the management and governance of sustainability at REL and has

been involved in the prioritisation of material factors for the Company. Based on our

materiality

assessment,

we

believe

that

environmental

topics

including

energy

consumption, emissions and compliance; and human capital related topics including

training &amp; development and health &amp; safety; are the most important impacts of our

business as well as priority of our stakeholders.

Looking forward, the Board will ensure that sustainability remains a core focus of the

Group and would like to thank the management and employees for their help in the

preparation of the report.

Sustainability at Ramba Energy Limited (1/3)

Sustainability has always been an integral part to how we do business at REL. We aspire to be a leading

service provider to our clients and deliver the best results to our investors; while ensuring the interests

and well-being of our employees, the environment and community.

Our Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) framework and various policies on quality, health and safety,

anti-corruption and code of conduct have guided us in our journey towards being a responsible corporate

citizen.

Sustainability Governance

The SGX guidelines have provided us with a

fresh opportunity to review and update how we

manage and govern sustainability related risks

and opportunities within the organisation.

Following the release of the guidelines, we have

identified functional champions who report to

senior management and gather information from

the different business departments in Singapore

and Indonesia. The management further reports

to the Board which is responsible for the overall

governance

of

sustainability

issues

in

the

organisation.

Materiality Assessment

We conducted our materiality assessment according to the GRI Standards’ Principles for defining

report content. An industry review exercise was conducted to short-list potential material factors from

a universe of Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) topics where our Company creates

significant impacts.

We engaged with our employees and management to seek their feedback and

validated the results with the Board to arrive to our final list of material factors. In future, we may

also consider engaging our other stakeholders such as key clients, investors and regulators in refining

our material topics.

Environment








10

Fuel Efficiency &amp; Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Energy consumption is a significant impact arising from our operations. Our Oil &amp; Gas business uses natural gas for

production and our Logistics business uses fuel for transportation. In addition, our offices and warehouses use electricity

for daily operations. The use of this energy creates significant direct and indirect GHG emissions. Enabling greater fuel

efficiency not only reduces our carbon footprint, dependence on non-renewable power and regulatory risks but also has a

direct contribution to our operational costs.

Management Approach

We are undertaking a number of initiatives that help minimize our

fuel consumption, improve energy efficiency and lower our

emissions.

Oil &amp; Gas

The majority of our operations use natural gas as fuel.

While

diesel engines are kept as back up, we strive to minimize their

usage. In addition, our plants are strategically located close to our

supply markets and thereby reduce our fuel consumption in

transportation of the products.

Logistics

Fleet Refresh: Over the years we have been replacing our fleet

from Euro 2 engine trucks to Euro 4 and 5 under the Fleet Refresh

program. Our program is designed to ensure that not less than 5%

of our fleet is upgraded annually to ensure that we operate on

modern fuel efficient fleet at all times.

Our ideal target, where

possible is to refresh up to 10% of our fleet annually. In 2017, we

have replaced 14 units of Euro 2 engine trucks to Euro 5.

In 2017, we have purchased 20 new vehicles that are the latest

available Euro 5 green engine standard as part of our commitment.

Fleet Management:

We utilize a fleet management software to

monitor our fleet and driver behavior. This enables us to plan our

routes and to improve fleet utilization and driver’s performance

while controlling any driver’s infringements whilst on the road.

This is helping us to improve driver’s behavior and reduce

unnecessary waste in our operations.

Fleet

Maintenance:

All

vehicles

are

run

on

scheduled

maintenance

program

to

maintain

optimal

performance

and

efficiency whilst allowing for regular safety checks, tire pressure

and tread depth are also measured consistency to ensure safety on

the road at all times.

Offices and Warehouses

We aim to lower energy usage at our offices and warehouses. We

monitor our energy consumption on a monthly basis and this year

we have installed sensor lighting to optimize usage.

We also

continue to educate and remind our staff through signage, notices

and communication at our premises.

Fuel Efficiency &amp; Greenhouse Gas Emissions



87,880 Giga Joules

Scope 1 emissions

6,070 TCO2 eq.

Scope 2 emissions

336 TCO2 eq.



Performance

Targets

• Replace diesel engine with gas engine at one of our Oil &amp; Gas plants

• Replace Euro 4 and Euro 5 engines with even more efficient Euro 6 engine trucks

• Eliminate Euro 2 and 4 fleet and operate Euro 5 engines as a minimum standard

wherever possible

*

Our energy data does not include the energy consumption of our logistics business in Indonesia. We would strive to

include that for our next report.

**

This includes data for our Jatirarangon Block in Indonesia, fleet fuel consumption and electricity use in Singapore.

The source of the emission factors used is IPCC Guidelines and the grid factor is Energy Market Authority.






12

Legal and Regulatory Compliance

Non-compliance with environmental regulations is a key financial and reputational risk to our

Company, particularly in our Oil &amp; Gas business.

Why Material

The nature of oil &amp; gas

operations

create

a

number of potential risks

that can be harmful to the

environment

and

community

and

often

come under the scrutiny of

regulators. The key risks

include

oil

spills,

flaring

and noise pollution.

Performance

Zero Incidents of Oil spills,

flaring

and

noise

levels

(above 85 decibels)

Our Actions

We follow a precautionary approach towards environmental management and

have implemented ISO 14000 systems in line with government regulations.

Each new project is assessed for environmental risks and monitoring of

environmental impact parameters is done on regular basis and reports are

submitted to local regulators such as MIGAS.

Managing noise pollution and flaring

We have developed a noise map along with guidelines for the plant and

surrounding areas to keep noise levels below 85 decibels and protect local

communities and our employees from over exposure. Flaring from our plant is

usually close to minimum since most of the gas is directed to the suction

compressor.

Protecting oil spills

Oil Spill Protection (‘Slickbars’) have been made available at field locations to

ensure quick action in case a spill happens and dikes, surrounding ditches and

colleting boxes are placed to contain the oil.

Targets

Going forward, we will strive to maintain zero incidents of non-compliance

with environmental regulations

Training and Development

People are our greatest asset and we deliver on our promises to our clients through our people. We invest in our

employees in order to make them the very best they can be. Employing over 700 people, we believe it is imperative

to enhance their skills on a continuous basis to meet the changing demands of the industry and prepare them to be

future ready.

Management Approach

We understand that each employee has different training needs

and we try to make the training journey of our employees as

customised as possible. Our programmes include:

• Comprehensive induction programme

• On-the-job training

• Structured skills training programmes focusing on leadership,

supervisory, functional and technical skills

• Professional qualifications

• Regular

defensive

Training and Development

Caring for our people

Creating a conducive workplace for our staff goes a long way in their

development. In order to foster such an environment, we have been

focusing on a number of activities this year.

Our annual employee

appreciation dinner was well attended and highly appreciated by our staff.

We also organised “RichBowl”, our annual ten pin bowling social event,

employee evenings and Family Day

which provided recreational and

bonding opportunities for our staff.

We also value diversity at our workplace, specifically the cultures and

individualism of each or our employees. By embracing diversity, we are

creating a dynamic work environment that helps employees to learn from

each other and develop their personalities further.

Engaging with our employees

We believe that employee engagement is a

key medium to understand the development

needs of our staff.

We facilitate this by

organising regular HR clinics, round table talks

and

employee

satisfaction

survey.

This

engagement help us to understand the ground

challenges, share new policies and run through

proposed programs and activities.







Targets

- Cascade a development program for second line management and below.

- Organise soft-skills

training programmes

relating to communication,

people management, root cause analysis and others






16

Health and Safety

Health, safety and wellness of our employees is essential for our Company to succeed. Given the nature of our

business, we recognize that the health and safety of our staff, particularly those working on-site, can be at risk.

With this in mind, we have put various controls in place to avoid any lapses from occurring.

Management Approach

The management has created a health and safety committee that governs,

monitors and manages any related issues that come up.

Monthly meetings,

attended by BU heads, are conducted to report any case studies and share

best practices.

As part of our programme, we also conduct site inspections

and regular tool box meetings for operational staff. In Indonesia, we conducted

emergency medical drills in case of any serious accident and simulation

exercises for fire handling.

We abide by a number of health and safety standards including OHSAS 18001

and SS 506 (Part 1).

In addition to our safety practices, we are also conducting a variety of personal

health and wellness initiatives such as health check-ups and sessions for

employees to discuss ways to reduce stress and increase efficiency at work.
