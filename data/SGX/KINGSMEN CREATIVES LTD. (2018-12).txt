MESSAGE FROM GROUP CEO

Sustainability is a fundamental tenet in Kingsmen. It is a continuous journey of learning and 

improving, and we believe we have built the right foundations for a sustainable business – 

driven by business excellence and value creation for all our stakeholders. 

In 2018, we continued our 

sustainability journey by reviewing of 

our business operations and focusing 

on areas important to Kingsmen 

and our stakeholders. We have been 

encouraged by the progress we have 

made, and endeavour to continue to 

seek opportunities at improving our 

sustainability efforts. 

Today’s business environment dictates 

that we have to be quick on our feet 

and adaptable to market changes. This 

can only be achieved if we have the 

right pillars in place. One such pillar 

is our talent pool. We therefore invest 

significantly in the development of our 

people to equip them with the necessary 

skills and knowledge needed for the 

future and our transformation journey 

ahead. We evaluated our training and 

development offerings and introduced 

new learning opportunities to support 

our future plans.  

As part of the Group’s effort to minimise 

our environmental footprint, we 

embarked on digitising our processes 

by building on our digital capabilities to 

better serve our customers and advocate 

best practices within the organisation. 

We are confident that as we move 

forward we will build momentum 

and have identified possible areas for 

improvement. 

On behalf of the Board, I would like 

to take this opportunity to thank 

all members of Kingsmen for their 

concerted efforts and our partners and 

stakeholders for their steady support as 

we continue to do even better in the 

years to come. 

Andrew Cheng 

Group Chief Executive Officer

OUR APPROACH 

TO SUSTAINABILITY 

Our sustainability strategy is driven by three key pillars of responsible business practice and 

aims to bring shared values and constantly challenge the way we work in order to achieve 

our business objectives:

We strive to be relevant 

in the marketplace 

&amp; generate profits 

to benefit our 

stakeholders &amp; the 

community at large. 

We will create 

sustainable value 

for our stakeholders 

&amp; are committed to 

aligning our long-term 

business strategies 

with their interests. 

We will continue to 

refine our sustainability 

framework and 

drive performance 

improvements around 

our key material issues.

Our vision is to become sustainably profitable, and we are prepared to constantly 

challenge the way we work in order to achieve this. Such thoughtful growth calls 

for the use of goals on sustainability that are rooted in our business ambitions. 

In line with our approach of integrating sustainability in our operations, we leverage 

on our stakeholder engagements and materiality assessment processes to identify 

sustainability risks and opportunities.

OUR 

PEOPLE 

People are the heart of the business at Kingsmen and we strongly believe 

in sustainable employability. We prioritise talent attraction and retention, 

providing a safe working environment, investing in training and creating a fun 

and motivating workplace for our people.

Our human resource Policies and Code of Conduct cover fair remuneration, 

benefits, health and safety, career development and training and are regularly 

reviewed by our management. The policies comply with the legal standards in 

the areas we operate in.

TALENT STRATEGY 

 

We aim to build a sustainable leadership 

pipeline of talents that will be nurtured to 

be the future leaders of the organization. 

As part of our leadership renewal plans, 

we participate in the Singapore-Industry 

Scholarship (SgIS) – a partnership 

between the Government and Kingsmen 

to develop a strong core of Singaporeans 

to anchor strategic sectors which are 

critical for Singapore’s development. 

To date, Kingsmen has welcomed 

seven scholars on board where they 

will undergo two rigorous years of job 

training and career development. 

In FY2018, we reviewed the annual 

performance appraisal framework to 

develop a more robust performance 

measurement for employees. The 

exercise emphasized targets setting, 

performance feedback and career 

development discussions. This initiative 

seeks to maximise employees’ full 

potential and enhance their career 

development prospects which would 

improve Kingsmen’s organisational 

performance as a whole. 

We also specifically monitor competency 

requirements for strategically critical 

roles, and maintain a look out for high-

potential internal candidates, providing 

them with development opportunities.



TRAINING AND 

DEVELOPMENT – 

KINGSMEN ACADEMY

We aspire to be a learning organisation 

with a culture of continuous learning 

to keep ahead of market trends 

and respond proactively to face the 

challenges of a dynamically changing 

landscape. All new Kingsmen employees 

undergo an onboarding programme, 

which exposes them to the culture 

of Kingsmen, a broad overview of the 

Company, and knowledge of their day-

to-day job roles and responsibilities.

OUR 

PEOPLE 

At Kingsmen, “Educating through 

Engagement” is a working and 

practicable maxim that places training 

right in the career path of our people. 

To build employee capability, we have 

the Kingsmen Academy which focuses 

on the development of our people to 

reach their fullest potential and provide 

them with a fulfilling career with the 

organisation. As part of the Kingsmen 

Academy, we have a total of 13 unique 

Kingsmen courses across 6 distinct 

categories – Sales &amp; Marketing, Process 

Management, Service Differentiation, 

Leadership/Management, Legal 

Knowledge and Finance.



In FY2018, we reviewed our development 

and engagement curriculum to ensure 

that our employees are well-equipped 

with the necessary expertise to 

compete in the experiential and digital 

economy. Customising courses to suit 

our specialised industry, we have since 

rolled out courses regionally to provide 

accessibility to learning opportunities 

for our employees. 

The training curriculum is guided by 

our strategy on employee development 

and consists of various programmes 

that range from core functional 

competencies to leadership capabilities 

and life skills. These include on-the-

job training and coaching, and the 

mentorship programme which provides 

a unique opportunity for identified 

employees to engage and learn from 

senior management through casual 

engagement sessions. 

LEADERSHIP 

DEVELOPMENT 

Delivery of our business strategy requires 

skilled leadership. That is why we have 

developed a series of custom-made 

programmes, some of which have 

been developed in collaboration with 

an external partner. These programmes 

focus on expanding our leaders’ skillsets 

and fostering their leadership and 

management potential.

Our annual regional conferences are 

aimed at accelerating the development 

of a strong regional talent pool 

across the Group, and enhancing 

their abilities to execute and achieve 

transformation goals of the organisation. 

The conferences are opportunities for 

future leaders to interact with different 

regional offices to gain new experiences 

and perspectives. 

TRAINING BEYOND 

THE CLASSROOM 

Behind every successful organisation 

lies a great team that works seamlessly 

together. Throughout the year, Kingsmen 

offices conduct team building exercises 

to strengthen the bond among its teams. 

10

K I N G S M E N  C R E A T I V E S  L T D










EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT 

We hold regular formal and informal 

engagement sessions to ensure that 

an inclusive work environment is 

cultivated. To promote a culture of open 

communications, constant interaction 

is maintained between managers and 

their teams to monitor the well-being 

of employees. In FY2018, we continued 

with the dialogue session series with the 

top management team to communicate 

and connect with senior managerial 

staff in more intimate settings. These 

sessions encourage attendees to share 

their views and address any concerns 

they may have. We have since extended 

these sessions to managers to align 

employees with the organisation’s broad 

goals and strategy. 

Our Sports &amp; Recreation Committee 

also organizes various events to bring 

employees together outside of their 

daily work – from our annual Dinner and 

Dance to sports-related events, health 

talks and other special interest activities. 

WORKPLACE HEALTH 

&amp; SAFETY

We provide a safe work environment 

for our people and a workplace safety 

and health committee actively promotes 

awareness on occupational health and 

safety and raises the safety standards 

for employees. 

The committee ensures that we comply 

with all regulatory requirements, 

conduct safety onsite inspections, fire 

safety plans, and enforces safety-related 

trainings of all operational staff.

OUR 

COMMUNITY 

We believe we have a responsibility to improve the lives of those in the 

communities we operate in and focus on initiatives that will contribute where 

it matters and have a positive impact. Beyond corporate work, our community 

strategy is centred on supporting various social initiatives in the areas of art, 

youth and education. 





Our focus on supporting youth 

empowerment is an extension of our 

motto of continuous learning that has 

become synonymous with Kingsmen. 

We hope to create opportunities for 

the marginalised youth through our 

support for the beneficiaries’ community 

engagement work. We also participate in 

other community initiatives on selective 

basis, ensuring that it is aligned with 

our community engagement objective. 

In FY2018, we continue to be partner 

with SHINE Children &amp; Youth Services 

(formerly known as “Students Care 

Service”) in giving back to the youth as 

a means of engaging our employees 

and contributing to the community. 

In partnering with SHINE, we strive to 

inspire youth to dream big. Partnering 

with social workers from SHINE, 

Kingsmen staff assist with the school-

based programme which consists of 

activities designed to help students 

develop social and life skills. Kingsmen 

also sponsored the Outward Bound 

Singapore Programme for SHINE youth 

which aimed to build character in the 

long run. Apart from various engagement 

activities with the students, the Group 

also supports its events and activities 

with fundraising efforts and has raised 

more than $350,000.

OUR 

ENVIRONMENT

SUSTAINABLE WORKING 

ENVIRONMENT 

We are a part of the global effort to sustain 

and better manage our resources and are 

constantly seeking ways to deliver more 

environmentally-friendly projects. 

Some of our conservation initiatives 

include adopting environmentally-

friendly practices into our processes, 

including all our offices and production 

plants to minimise the impact of our 

business operations on the environment. 

As part of our standard operating 

procedures, we also reduce energy and 

water consumption. 

Kingsmen works continually to reduce 

our energy consumption and cost is 

monitored regularly to identify how the 

greatest energy savings can be achieved. 

Within offices, timers and temperature 

controls are set for air conditioners to 

avoid unnecessary energy consumption 

and regular maintenance is arranged to 

ensure that power is used efficiently. 

In the production plants, equipment is 

regularly maintained and upgraded to 

enhance electricity efficiency. Project 

scheduling at production plants ensure 

that equipment is operating at optimal 

efficiency to reduce unnecessary energy 

consumption.

To reduce our carbon footprint, the 

Group promotes video conferencing 

and collaboration technologies to 

conduct meetings, reducing non-

essential flights.

LED lights have been installed and 

motion detectors in corridors ensure 

lights are switched off when not in use. 

Our Green Committee champions 

environmentalism within the Group 

and employees are actively involved 

in fulfilling our Green philosophy, by 

engaging in green practices within 

our day-to-day operations, basically 

to practice the 3Rs – recycle, reuse 

and reduce. Our Hong Kong office 

embarked on a Plantation Enrichment 

Project ‘Tree Care Day’ to encourage 

staff to embark on sustainable efforts 

for the environment. 

SUSTAINABLE DESIGN &amp; 

WASTE MANAGEMENT

Our designers and project personnel 

advocate green design during 

the planning process and there is 

collaborative effort to seek ways to 

make projects more eco-friendly with 

the introduction of new innovative 

products and materials to minimize 

the amount of waste we generate. We 

also consider environmental impacts 

in our recommendations to clients and 

during procurement. 

Our service offerings include the rental 

of more than 100 furniture types to 

reduce the material consumption at 

events. In addition, we also offer clients 

the option of recycling custom-built 

booth components to reduce waste 

and provide turnkey services for 

storage to refurbishment after each 

show, extending the lifespan of the 

built materials. Modular systems such 

as Octanorm and Maxima are design 

solutions for booth structures which 

provide versatility and can be reused. 

Increasingly, we are exploring the 

extensive use of new technologies and 

materials to reduce waste and help our 

clients create unique experiences that 

create more value. 

The Kingsmen Environmental Policy 

clearly specifies that our suppliers 

and partners are briefed on our waste 

management policy and on-site 

supervisors ensure compliance. 

OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL 

INITIATIVES

The Group promotes digitalisation in our 

internal and external business operations 

through a steady conversion to online 

applications in order to reduce paper 

consumption. 

We acknowledge that change is 

necessary but it is a long-term ongoing 

process, as these are practices well 

entrenched in the industries we operate 

in, but we will continue to work with our 

business partners to raise their awareness 

and look to reduce our carbon footprint 

through innovative ways. 

As part of Kingsmen’s sustainability practice, we embrace sustainability in ways 

that generate value for both our organization and our clients throughout the 

planning and execution phase of our projects. We understand that our business 

processes can have positive and negative environmental impacts and our goal 

is to provide services that wherever practical, minimizes the negative and 

maximises the positive longer-term impacts.
