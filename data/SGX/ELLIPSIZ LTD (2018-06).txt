Board Statement 

 

 

 

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) is pleased to present the inaugural Sustainability Report of 

Ellipsiz Ltd (“Ellipsiz” or the “Company”) for the financial year ended 30 June 2018. This report is 

prepared in line with the sustainability reporting requirements of the Singapore Exchange Securities 

Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Manual.  

 

In this report, we share a description of our existing policies, approaches and initiatives towards 

sustainability, with focus on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) topics that are considered 

material to Ellipsiz and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) and our key stakeholders.  

 

The Board is entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing the business and corporate affairs of the 

Group, including sustainability.  The Board has considered sustainability issues as part of its strategic 

formulation, and determined the ESG factors which are material to the Group for reporting. The Board 

is assisted by a team comprising certain senior management and key executives of the Group who 

review, assess and make recommendations to the Board on sustainability matters. This includes 

identification, management and monitoring of the material ESG factors. The Company has appointed 

an external consultant to advise it on this report. 

 

We aim to improve our sustainability practices continuously to better support our business strategies, 

and to explore constructive learning opportunities for sustainability on an on-going basis.

About Ellipsiz Ltd 

 

Ellipsiz was founded as a leading provider of integrated solutions in the electronics industry. Over the 

years, it has become one of the leading engineering and service solutions providers, serving customers 

across the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industries in Asia. In October 2017, Ellipsiz 

divested its leading probe card solutions designing and manufacturing business. Ellipsiz is currently 

focused on the business of distributing a wide range of manufacturing, testing and 

inspection/measurement equipment to the semiconductor, electronics manufacturing and 

telecommunication industries.  

 

Ellipsiz’s key competitive strengths lie in its innovation, strong customer focus, resourcefulness, strong 

partnership with customers and principals and established regional support network. Ellipsiz is 

headquartered and operates in Singapore and also has operations in Taiwan, China and Malaysia. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Group operates via a basic supply chain structure, where the lead company forms a series of 

relationships with companies that buy and sell a wide range of equipment and products. We operate 

and provide our product and service solutions to customers in various countries, including Singapore, 

Taiwan, China and Malaysia. As a result, our business and its future growth are dependent on the 

political, economic, regulatory and social conditions of these countries. The Group’s efforts to 

streamline, consolidate and integrate various distribution &amp; service solutions (“DSS”) businesses over 

the past few years have unlocked further cross-marketing and cross leveraging opportunities between 

East Asia and Southeast Asia operations. This has created invaluable synergies across markets and 

distribution networks. Please refer to Ellipsiz’s Annual Report 2018 for more details on our business 

operations.

About our Report 

 

This report has been prepared in line with the sustainability reporting requirements of the SGX-ST 

Listing Manual. It has been developed with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 

Standards. We have selected GRI Standards as our sustainability reporting framework as we believe it 

provides robust guidance and is globally accepted for sustainability reporting. 

 

Our reporting boundary includes the Company and the Group’s DSS operations in Singapore, Taiwan, 

China and Malaysia. 

 

We summarise in this report key aspects of the Group’s approach towards sustainability for the period 

from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018 (“FY 2018”), with a focus on the Group’s material ESG topics as set 

out in the section entitled “Our Sustainability Approach” below. We also provide information on the 

process adopted for identification of the material ESG topics covered by this report. Data presented in 

this report has been drawn from the Group’s operations included within the reporting boundary.  

 

In addition, whilst strictly not part of the scope of our report, we have provided some information 

relating to the Group’s initiatives on being a caring corporate citizen by giving back to society through 

corporate social responsibility programs. 

 

If you wish to provide feedback on this report, please reach out to us at ir@ellipsiz.com.  

 

 

 

Our Sustainability Approach 

 

Sustainability Governance 

 

Our organisation-wide sustainability agenda is led by a team comprising certain senior management 

and key executives of the Group who assist the Board in overseeing the sustainability reporting.  The 

team initiates, drives, and monitors various aspects of the Group’s sustainability practices, ensuring 

effective integration of ESG initiatives into the business operations and corporate objectives.

Stakeholder engagement 

 

We define our key stakeholders as groups of people or entities whom we consider are significantly 

affected by our business operations and outcomes, or who may significantly influence our businesses. 

Feedback from our key stakeholders forms a crucial part of our strategic and business planning, and it 

provides the Group with valuable insight to continuously improve our sustainability performance. 

Through internal discussions and reviews with the external consultant, the following key stakeholders 

of the Group are identified:    

 

• 

Customers  

• 

Employees  

• 

Suppliers  

• 

Shareholders &amp; Investors 

• 

Government &amp; Regulators 

 

Understanding the key stakeholders’ material concerns and expectations is an essential part of Ellipsiz’s 

sustainability approach. Through regular formal and informal engagements, we develop mutually 

beneficial relationships with our key stakeholders.

The following figure summarises our approach in engaging with the key stakeholders:

Materiality assessment 

 

Materiality is a critical input in our corporate sustainability strategy as we strive to provide our key 

stakeholders with the sustainability information most relevant to them, and to our business. In 

determining the material factors of the Group, we have conducted an internal materiality assessment 

with the help of our external consultant. The process included interviews with employees and 

management, and internal workshops to identify the material sustainability issues taking into account 

our operations in Singapore, Taiwan, China and Malaysia. 

 

Ellipsiz adopts a systematic four-step approach in determining the material topics: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The assessment yielded 5 material ESG factors, namely: 

• 

Talent attraction and retention 

• 

Diversity and equal opportunity 

• 

Environmental compliance 

• 

Economic performance 

• 

Anti-corruption 

 

 

 

 

Identification

Sustainability issues 

and sustainability 

topics that are 

relevant to key 

stakeholders and GRI 

Standards. 

Prioritisation

Material issues are 

grouped under the 

shortlisted GRI 

material topics and 

are ranked in relation 

to the significance of 

their ESG impact and 

importance to key 

stakeholders.

Validation

and key executives 

provide feedback to 

ensure completeness 

and relevance of 

topics selected.

Review

relation to the 

feedback obtained are 

re-examined to 

prepare for reporting.

Social performance 

 

(a) Talent attraction and retention  

 

In the current competitive landscape, talent attraction and retention remain a key concern for the 

Group. We are committed to developing our human capital and encourage our employees to 

constantly develop and improve their knowledge and skillsets through various upgrading and career 

development plans. We recognise all our employees’ contributions and aim to foster an 

entrepreneurial environment.

(c) Corporate Social Responsibility 

 

We strive to be a responsible and caring corporate citizen. Ellipsiz supports corporate social 

responsibility programs through various community and charitable causes. 

 

We encourage our employees to get involved in reaching out directly to the community, with the 

intent of raising awareness and cultivating a sense of social responsibility towards the less privileged 

in our society. 

 

In May 2018, our employees participated as volunteers in the Project 100=50 charity event held at 

Sree Narayana Mission Home for the Aged Sick. This event aimed to help underprivileged families 

that did not qualify for government subsidies to defray part of their financial burden by providing 

them with groceries and household items at a discount. Overall, the event managed to help over 120 

families in need.

We believe that every act of kindness goes a long way, and everyone has a part to play in building 

a gracious society.

Environmental performance 

 

(a) Environmental Responsibility   

 

The Group is committed to being a socially responsible organisation and strives to take measures 

to manage its environmental impact. We encourage our employees to observe green practices to 

conserve energy, reduce waste, save paper, and to minimise the negative impact that we have on 

the environment overall. We believe that every little step goes a long way towards sustaining a clean 

and green environment, and at the same time help to improve efficiencies and deliver cost 

reductions for the Group. 

 

(b) Environmental Compliance   

 

There were no significant fines or non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with environmental 

laws and/or regulations during FY 2018. We aim to improve our environmental compliance related 

processes and procedures going forward so as to maintain zero incidents of significant non-

compliance with applicable environmental laws and/or regulations.  

 

 

Governance performance  

 

(a) Direct economic value generated and distributed 

 

The Group’s revenue from continuing operations was $49.1 million in FY 2018, an improvement 

of 18% over the financial year ended 30 June 2017 of $41.8 million. Growth was mainly from the 

Group’s DSS operations in Singapore, China and Taiwan.  

 

Please refer to our Annual Report 2018 (sections entitled “Financial Review” and “Financial 

Statements”) for further details on the Group’s financial performance. 

 

(b) Anti-corruption 

 

The Group is opposed to corruption, which is inconsistent with its values. All employees of the 

Group are expected to observe integrity and conduct themselves in a professional and ethical 

manner in their course of work. 

 

The Group has in place an Employees’ Code of Conduct and Ethics Policy (“Conduct Policy”) 

which sets out, inter alia, the guidelines of acceptable codes of ethics in a workplace. As part of our 

yearly exercise, all employees are required to read and refresh themselves on the guidelines set out 

in the Conduct Policy, and to complete a declaration form to confirm that he or she is in compliance 

with the Conduct Policy.  

 

In addition, the Group has a whistleblowing policy (“Whistleblowing Policy”) in place to 

promote good ethical standards, integrity and governance in the corporate conduct and business 

practices of the Group. The Whistleblowing Policy provides an avenue for employees of the Group 

to raise in confidence, concerns about actual or suspected improprieties about, amongst others, 

financial reporting, internal controls, corruption, bribery and fraud, and offer assurance that 

employees raising such concerns will be protected from reprisals for whistleblowing in good faith. 

Whistleblowing concerns received will be handled in accordance with the procedures set out in the 

Whistleblowing Policy, including the course of action based on information provided.
