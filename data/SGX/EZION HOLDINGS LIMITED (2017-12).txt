Chairman’s Letter to Stakeholders 

 

 

Dear Stakeholders, 

 

This year marks the issuance of our inaugural sustainability report, which has been prepared in 

accordance with the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited’s (“SGX-ST”) sustainability 

reporting guidelines. Our Sustainability Report is aligned to SGX-ST Listing Rule 711B, Practice Note 

7.6 and the internationally recognised Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards.  

In this report, we showcase the Group’s commitment to uphold the sustainability standards across all 

aspects of our business strategy and operations.  We recognize the increasing emphasis that our 

stakeholders have with regards to environmental, social and governance issues in their decisions and 

the Group is committed to grow in a sustainable manner.   

We are fully aware that our global operations in the Liftboat as well as offshore oil &amp; gas sector has a 

tremendous impact on the environment.  As such, we have made it our priority to innovate through 

process enhancement, utilise energy-saving technology and apply strict standards in our operations to 

conserve biodiversity and minimize impact on the environment.  

The Group imposes a stringent and high standard of occupational health and safety guidelines to govern 

our operations. We adopt a zero-tolerance approach to any breach of regulatory and safety 

requirements to ensure a safe and conducive working environment.  We are pleased to announce that 

there has been no time loss due to injuries for the past 2 years. 

The Group has also ventured into providing support services for the construction and maintenance of 

offshore wind farms.  We have a set of safety framework and policies in place to ensure the safety and 

well-being of our employees. 

Ezion will engage with local communities on an ongoing basis to understand their needs including 

education and healthcare, and implement appropriate programmes to improve their overall well-being 

and create positive social impacts. 

Ultimately, we are steadfast in our belief that the Group’s success should not only consider financial 

success but also how we can grow sustainably and create a better future. 

 

Dr Wang Kai Yuen

Ethics and Integrity  

 

Ezion works diligently to ensure our employees adhere to the highest standards of ethics and integrity 

and comply with applicable regulations and professional codes of conduct.   

 

Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy (GRI 205-1, 205-2, 205-3) 

 

The Group has implemented an anti-bribery and corruption policy whereby it is set out that there is a 

zero tolerance approach to unethical behaviour.  Ezion is committed to comply with all anti-bribery and 

corruption laws where we do business at all times.  All new staff are briefed on the established Code of 

Conduct during their orientation. 

 

To ensure our staff conduct themselves in a professional manner when dealing with clients and vendors, 

Ezion requires staff to declare receipt of gifts from third parties. To avoid putting staff in a compromising 

position, in particular those holding senior positions and those having to deal with vendors, staff are to 

declare any conflict of interest, both potential or real, on a regular basis or as and when they deem 

timely. The Group does not condone bribery and corruption by third parties and/or government entities.   

 

The Group has provided accessible channels for employees, shareholders, clients, consultants and 

suppliers to raise concerns on possible improprieties in financial reporting, fraudulent acts and other 

irregularities. These communication channels ensure independent investigations and timely 

implementation of appropriate preventive and corrective actions.  For FY2017, there were no instances 

of confirmed incident of corruption or any whistleblowing reports.   

 

 

Governance &amp; Statement of the Board  

 

Ezion’s Board and Senior Management assess sustainability issues as part of the strategic formulation 

of the Group. The Board is supported by the management’s Sustainability Task Force (“STF”) 

comprising heads of different business units which help to spearhead sustainability efforts in the 

organization. The STF is chaired by Group Chief Financial Officer who will oversee achievement of all 

sustainability targets and report to the Board.   

 

The Board oversees the process of engaging stakeholders, and identifying material topics. The Board 

has considered sustainability issues as part of our strategic formulation, approved the material 

environmental, social and economic topics identified and overseen that the factors identified are 

managed and monitored. 

 

Ezion adopts a precautionary approach in strategic decision making and daily operations by 

implementing a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) framework which is aligned with 

the requirements of ISO 31000:2009 Risk Management framework. To enhance the effectiveness of 

the ERM framework, the Group implemented Orion ERM system, a third party software that automates 

the risk management, internal control and assurance functions and enables these functions to be 

managed on an integrated platform. On a yearly basis, a Group-wide assessment is conducted to 

update the firm’s risk profile in the ERM framework and reflects changing business risk exposures and 

addresses the significant and relevant risks to the Group. 

 

Please refer to the ‘Corporate Governance Report’ in the Annual Report 2017 for details of our risk 

management practices.

Protecting the Environment 

 

Ezion places great priority on complying with governmental laws and regulations as well as taking the 

necessary steps to protect the environment. In recognition of our stakeholders’ increasing attention 

towards climate change and environmental conservation, the Group is committed to increase efforts to 

reduce our negative impact on the environment.  By managing our operations to use green sources, 

we look forward to protecting the environment and saving costs at the same time. 

 

Energy and Emissions Management (GRI 302-1, 302-4, 302-5, 305-2, 305-5) 

 

The Group is committed to managing energy and emissions in the most sustainable manner possible.  

Ezion has implemented various initiatives targeted at reducing energy consumption both in the office 

as well as on the vessels and rigs utilised by the Group.  Our vessels are provided with the Ship Energy 

Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) in compliance with IMO MARPOL Annex VI for the reduction of 

GHG. We strive to achieve energy efficient operations through thorough planning, implementation, 

monitoring and review of energy efficiency measures within a continuous improvement management 

cycle. We implement measures such as monitoring of fuel consumption, minimizing hull resistance, 

maintaining optimum speed during open sea passages, reducing heat/energy loss, training vessel staff 

in energy efficiency, reducing fuel wastage by ensuring, electrical lighting control, adjusting trim and 

reduce ballast as far as practicable.  

 

We have reduced our GHG (Scope 1 and Scope 2) emissions to a sustainable level and target to 

improve our performance in the future.   

 

Managing Biodiversity (GRI 304-1, 304-2, 304-3) 

 

Ezion has an environmental management plan to safeguard and enhance the environment as well as 

to sustain economic and social benefits from the ecosystems. The Group has implemented an 

Environmental and Social Assessment program to address the importance of saving the environment. 

 

Ezion has a marine environmental management plan which underlines the procedures and process in 

which spillage is dealt with by the crew and management. There are robust controls over preventive 

measures for activities with high spillage risk. By having zero tolerance for spillage of harmful chemicals, 

Ezion hopes to protect the biodiversity where operational activities are being carried out. 

 

Water and Waste Discharge (GRI 306-1, 306-2, 306-3, 306-4, 306-5) 

 

Ezion has derived the sound management system principles from the requirements of the “International 

Management Code for the Safe Operations of Ships and for Pollution Prevention” (ISM Code), ISO 

9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and OHSAS 18001:2006.   

 

Ezion has also put in place an internal audit system to ensure that the conformance and effective 

implementation of its Integrated Management System. External audits are conducted by ABS 

Management System Certifications on-board our assets for compliance to the ISM and ISO 14001 

Standard. 

 

The Integrated Management System is reviewed annually to identify and ensure compliance to 

mandatory rules, applicable codes, guidelines and standards recommended by the IMO, 

Administrations, Classifications Societies and maritime industry organisations regulations applicable to 

both ships and shore-based operations. 


12 

 

 

Managing our Suppliers (GRI 308-1, 308-2) 

 

Ezion assess its major suppliers on their environmental and social impacts using topics from the GRI 

Standards on an annual basis. The assessment will require suppliers to disclose financial stability, 

licensing and specific certifications such as ISO9001, ISO14001, OHSAS 18001 which relates to 

responsibility of environment accreditation. 

 

Annual appraisals on the performance of all key suppliers in terms of environmental regulation 

compliance will be carried out to ascertain that the environment is not compromised by the activities of 

Ezion’s suppliers. 

 

 

Workplace Health &amp; Safety 

 

Vision towards an Accident-free Work Culture (GRI 403-1, 403-2, 403-3) 

 

To protect the health and safety of our employees, we have implemented stringent policies and 

operational procedures to govern all offshore activities.  Strict compliance to these policies are enforced 

by the Group to protect our employees. 

 

Liftboat Operations 

 

As our operations are in diverse parts of the world where illnesses and diseases are not uncommon, 

we have implemented various medical policies to minimize the health risk of our employees working in 

such areas. Ezion has established various medical response plans such as Influenza, Ebola, 

Tuberculosis and Malaria plans as part of our emergency response plan.  This is to allow us to respond 

to the threat of serious diseases in a timely manner by putting in place appropriate measures to mitigate 

risk. The HSEQA Department regularly disseminates medical and travel advice to all office and 

seafarers. Doctors / Medics are stationed on board our Liftboats to provide medical responses and 

conduct weekly regular hygiene inspections.  

 

Wind Farm Operations 

 

Our wind farm installation and construction site safety is managed by a Health, Safety and 

Environmental Committee comprising of qualified personnel.  The Committee works hard to provide a 

safe working environment and promotes safe working practices in all daily operations. Our management 

assess all identified risks to the employee, vessels and the environment and establishes appropriate 

safeguards.  We monitor all incidents / accidents for timely address and institute mitigating and 

preventive controls to protect the safety of our employees.    

 

Our incident / accident statistic for both Liftboat and wind farm operations are as follows:

People Focused 

 

Ezion is an equal opportunity employer. Our employment practices are non-discriminatory in nature and 

are based solely on job-related factors. Our employees are remunerated, employed and promoted 

based on performance, and the potential and willingness to take on higher responsibilities or job scopes, 

without reference to any distinction or preference made on the basis of race, national origin, religion, 

sex or marital status. 

 

 

Employee Diversity (GRI 401-1, 405-1, 413-1) 

 

Due to the massive geographical coverage of our shipping operations, we employ crew and employees 

from more than 20 countries around the world.  Our employee diversity spans the globe as illustrated 

below. 

 

 

 

 

Employee Benefits (GRI 401-2, 401-3) 

 

Ezion values our employees who are the backbone of our organisation.  We uphold employee welfare 

and have various schemes to ensure that our employees receive fair employee benefits.   

 

Ezion’s employee benefits, in addition to remunerating staff based on the local market pay practices in 

the countries that we operate in, is also aligned to local legislations and market practices through 

providing competitive benefits scheme for our full time staff.  Also, our employees can continue to work 

in Ezion on a permanent employment contract without wage reduction for the same job scope when 

they reach official retirement age.  

 

 

 

 








14 

 

 

Training and Career Development (GRI 404-1, 404-2, 404-3) 

 

Ezion is of the belief that having a well-trained workforce is what keeps the Company at the forefront of 

its business activities. Training is an important aspect of the Company’s commitment to the 

development of our employees. Review of the Performance Appraisal will culminate into a 

developmental training roadmap from our Training Department which aims to facilitate staff 

improvement plans and develop key skills required for individual roles.   

 

Ezion understands the value and importance of its human capital. Performance Appraisals are 

conducted on an annual basis to promote staff engagement, retention and performance. Staff will be 

appraised on their performance, progress and attributes with their respective people managers, from 

which targets to work towards, stretched and realistic, are discussed and set.  

 

Holistically, Ezion conducts Townhall meetings to promote staff communication and communication of 

company direction. In spite of the downturn the industry is experiencing, the company has abstained 

from retrenchment exercises.  

 

Gender Equality (GRI 405-2) 

 

Ezion believes in fair remuneration for all our employees based on seniority level and performance.  

Basic remuneration for women is equal and comparable to men of similar seniority level and 

performance.  We do not gender discriminate and highly uphold the principle of employee fairness and 

equitable remuneration without placing gender into the equation. 

 

Risk of Unethical Labour Management (GRI 408-1, 409-1, 412-1) 

 

Ezion prides itself as a good global corporate citizen. We abide strictly to acceptable societal norms on 

how we carry out our work and in the appointment of suppliers.  We do not condone the engagement 

of child labour or forced labour in our work. In this respect, we usually engage suppliers of reputable 

standing, whom we believe share the same societal norms. 

 

Incidents of non-compliance (GRI 416-1, 416-2, 419-1) 

 

Ezion’s commitment has been reflected / documented in its HSE and Quality policy and the 

comprehensive Management system. Our Management system is fully implemented across the 

company and the fleet is audited internally and externally (e.g. Classifications Society, Flag State, and 

Port State), for compliance. Vessels operate at the industry’s highest safety standard.  

 

During 2017, all vessels operated by Ezion had fully complied with the applicable codes, rules, and 

guidelines, standard as required by the IMO, Administrations, Classification societies, and Maritime 

industries. There were no instances of non-compliance, PSC detention or any fines imposed on any 

vessel operated by the Group. 

 

 


15 

 

 

Contribution to Local Economy 

 

Ezion’s operations span the entire globe and have an impact on local economies.  We hope to have a 

positive impact on local economies through procurement and hiring practices. Efforts to innovate and 

enhance our operations potentially stimulate innovation and create greater working opportunities in 

local communities. 

 

Indirect Economic Impacts (GRI 202-1, 202-2, 203-1, 203-2, 204-1) 

 

Ezion’s global operations result in a business footprint that spans across multiple countries. The 

company is committed to making economic contributions to the countries in which it operates in through 

paying its fair share of corporate taxes to the governing bodies of the countries. We adhere strictly to 

the business framework set up in each country to ensure we are in compliance with the business ethics 

of operations.  

 

Enhancing employment opportunities in the local community 

 

Developing offshore wind energy infrastructure creates jobs in component manufacturing, turbine 

installation, facility operation and maintenance, and in a variety of other areas which indirectly support 

these activities. Manufacturing requires skilled labourers who design and build towers, rotor blades, 

generators, hubs, substation interconnects, and assorted electronic controls which make up a wind 

turbine power generating platform. Installation typically involves local construction firms which help to 

boost local economies. The operation and maintenance needs of wind farms create permanent and 

high-quality local jobs.    

 

The economic impact of building an offshore wind farm extends well beyond the direct jobs created by 

building and installing the equipment. Each dollar invested creates impacts that ripple outwards 

throughout the local economy and creates indirect jobs for supplies of intermediates, components and 

services. In addition, all new workers require housing, food and other necessities that will be purchased 

locally.  

 

Procurement Practices Opportunities 

The Group’s Manufacturers, Developers and Contractors require support in cranes, transportation, 

labour, accommodation and subsistence which are sourced locally. During our operations, there will be 

additional demands for inputs from industries that sell non-labour goods and services directly to the 

project (i.e. raw materials, equipment / tools, industrial / manufacturing required services, etc.). In 

addition, there are increases in employment, income, and demand for other goods and services that 

would be generated by the expenditure of disposable income of the newly hired workers such as 

housing / accommodation, F&amp;B, transportation, consumer goods sale etc. 

 

Skills upgrading 

The Group also work with local companies during the execution of its projects. The staff at local 

companies will develop skills and capabilities that will benefit the economy in the longer term.  

 

Training of the locals is a very important part of workforce readiness.  Using the external developers’ 

and contractors’ skills and knowledge as a model, community colleges, universities and unions can be 

enlisted to offer specialized training.  

 

 

 


16 

 

 

Community Engagement (GRI 413-1) 

 

The Group endeavours to achieve a sustainable development of the local communities where we 

operate in. As such, we will engage with local communities on an ongoing basis to understand their 

needs including education and healthcare, and implement appropriate community engagement 

programmes to improve their overall well-being.
