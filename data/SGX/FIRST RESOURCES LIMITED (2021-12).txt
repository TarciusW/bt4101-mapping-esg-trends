Dear Stakeholders, 

I

t is with great pleasure that I present First Resources’ 

Sustainability Report 2021, which details our 

sustainability commitments, approach, and progress  

in the past year.

ADAPTING TO THE NEW NORMAL 

Due to strong demand, palm oil prices reached record levels 

in 2021. However, the year proved challenging for the palm 

oil industry. Unpredictable surges in COVID-19 caseloads 

resulted in the periodic reimposition of movement 

restrictions, disrupting global supply chains and causing 

labour shortages. It was critical for First Resources to take 

concrete steps to effectively navigate these challenges.  

The health and safety of our employees remain our top 

priority during this time. We continued to implement 

measures to protect the health of our employees by 

establishing safe working measures aligned with the latest 

government regulations. Precautions were made across our 

operations to comply with safe-distancing measures and 

self-isolation protocols. We also established a complementary 

hotline to address queries related to our COVID-19 

protocols, and facilitated the vaccination of all our eligible 

employees, their families, and the surrounding communities. 

We are pleased to announce a high vaccination rate of 95% 

for our office employees and 70% for our field employees. 

To boost the morale and mental wellbeing of our 

employees, we engaged several motivational speakers and 

organised informative webinars on stress management. 

Taken together, these initiatives allow us to fortify the 

resilience of our workforce against unforeseen shocks and 

facilitate our transition into a post-pandemic world. 

OUR PROGRESS IN 2021

Although we were optimistic for a swift recovery in early 

2021, some of our sustainability plans were ultimately 

upended by the volatile COVID-19 situation, especially on 

the certification front. We have completed the Roundtable 

on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and Indonesian Sustainable 

Palm oil (ISPO) audits for the mills we had planned to certify 

in 2021, and aim to complete the process in 2022.  

Having achieved 100% traceability to mills since 2017, and 

100% traceability to plantations for fresh fruit bunches 

(FFB) processed at our mills since 2020, we are proud to 

have reached our goal of 100% traceability to mills for 

all our kernel crushing plants. To enhance traceability to 

plantations for our third-party crude palm oil (CPO) and 

palm kernel (PK) suppliers, we integrated a supplier risk 

assessment as a key criterion in our onboarding procedure, 

bringing us closer to our goal of establishing a sustainable 

and transparent supply chain.

C E O ’ S  M E S S A G E

Despite challenging operational circumstances, we maintained 

environmental sustainability as a key priority in our 

operations. We rehabilitated 26 hectares of High Conservation 

Value (HCV) areas within our estates by planting over 7,900 

trees, and organised educational workshops to promote 

wildlife conservation among employees and surrounding 

communities. With the help of our seven operating 

methane capture facilities, we were able to avoid 180,000

tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) of greenhouse 

gas (GHG) emissions per year which is comparable to 

38,784 passenger vehicles1 driven for one year. 

To pre-empt future disease outbreaks in our plantations, we 

partnered with the Indonesian Palm Oil Genome Consortium 

to develop Ganoderma-resistant planting material. While 

research is still underway, we are optimistic that our 

partnership will yield new breakthroughs in crop resilience. 



Recognising the importance of talent development to 

the success and longevity of the business, we continued 

to groom high-potential employees for future leadership 

positions through our Executive Development Programme. 

We also launched the “Informance” application to provide 

our employees with on-demand feedback on their work. 

We made improvements in our safety performance and 

achieved zero permanent work-related injuries. We will 

continue to strive to provide a workplace that is safe, 

inclusive and rewarding for our employees.

We also continued to support the surrounding communities 

where we operate through investments in infrastructure, 

education, and healthcare, in addition to helping them 

navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. First Resources stepped 

in as a corporate donor to the “Indonesia Pasti Bisa Jaga 

Oksigen” programme, contributing IDR 435 million to 

finance the purchase of additional oxygen supplies for 

hospitals overwhelmed by a surge in cases. Our 11 health 

clinics also started offering COVID-19 vaccinations to 

support the national vaccination programme.

LOOKING AHEAD

As the world emerges from the throes of the COVID-19 

pandemic, issues such as climate change have once again 

been catapulted to the forefront of the global agenda. 

Ahead of the Conference of Parties (COP) event in 2021, 

the Indonesian government has set a target to reach carbon 

neutrality by 2060. 

As a palm oil company, First Resources has a crucial role 

to play. We will be looking to establish our baseline GHG 

emissions in line with global standards, set a reduction 

target, and identify reduction levers, in support of global 

climate ambitions. 

With the gradual easing of domestic and international travel 

restrictions in Indonesia, I am also hopeful that we can 

expedite our certification programmes.

I would like to thank our employees and stakeholders for 

their unwavering dedication and patience as we tide over 

these difficult times. While 2021 has been nothing short 

of challenging, we are eager to regain our momentum and 

accelerate our sustainability initiatives in 2022.  I call upon 

our stakeholders to continue supporting us as we embark 

on a fresh phase in our sustainability journey.

SUSTAINABILITY [102-18, 

102-19, 102-20, 102-21, 102-26, 

102-32, 103-3]

We are committed to maintaining 

the highest standards of corporate 

governance at First Resources. 

This is crucial for the effective 

implementation of our policies and 

the continual improvement of the 

Group’s performance. The Board, led 

by the Chairman, has oversight of 

sustainability matters and receives

that are attended by representatives 

from all key areas of our operations. 

Responsibility for the day-to-day 

implementation of our sustainability 

policy is delegated to our Head of 

Sustainability, who reports directly 

to the CEO, and is supported by a 

team of skilled experts from across

of employment. 

All new employees are briefed 

about our Code of Conduct as 

part of their onboarding process. 

An email reminder on compliance 

with the Code of Conduct as well 

as any relevant updates is sent to all 

employees on an annual basis. We 

also disseminate the Code of Conduct 

to all our suppliers and other  

business partners. 

In addition, we have put in place 

procedures to ensure that only 

authorised persons can approve 

business transactions and to prevent 

conflicts of interest in relation  

to procurement.

the key performance indicators of relevant 

senior executives and other employees with

MONITORING AND 

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE 

[102-17, 103-3]

We have set up a robust system to 

ensure that our commitments are 

implemented, and that practices and 

performance related to our policies 

can be monitored and reported. We 

have two distinct mechanisms for 

reporting concerns or complaints: 

our whistleblowing procedure and 

our grievance procedure. Both 

mechanisms are open to external and 

internal stakeholders. 

WHISTLEBLOWING 

PROCEDURE 

We designed our whistleblowing 

procedure to ensure that employees 

and business partners have a safe and 

anonymous avenue to raise concerns, 

non-compliances or grievances. 

For convenience, the system is 

accessible via various channels such 

as anonymous complaint boxes in 

estates, short message service, phone 

and email. Complaints raised through 

these channels are generally handled 

locally but can be escalated to the 

Audit Committee when necessary.

First Resources does not tolerate 

or condone any retaliatory actions 

taken against any employee or other 

person for raising a compliance or 

integrity issue. The Company may 

take disciplinary action against any 

party found to have retaliated against 

whistleblowers. Individuals who wish 

to file a whistleblowing report may 

refer to the details on our website. 

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE 

Our grievance procedure allows 

stakeholders to register sustainability-

related concerns, particularly with 

regard to our Policy on Sustainable 

Palm Oil, such as those related to 

deforestation, land disputes, human 

rights or general labour issues. 

Grievances can be submitted via 

email to our Grievance Officer or 

can be posted via mail to our office 

address as follows:

8 Temasek Boulevard

#36-02 Suntec Tower Three

Singapore 038988

Attn: Grievance Officer 

(Sustainability Department)

E sustainability@first-resources.com

Our philosophy is to work collaboratively and 

constructively with all our stakeholders. We want 

stakeholders to engage us directly with their 

concerns so that these can be investigated and 

remediated as quickly as possible. We appreciate 

and welcome stakeholders, including non-

governmental organisations, to engage positively 

with us and address any gaps in our operations. 

Our grievance list is updated regularly and is 

available on our website.

OUR MATERIAL 

SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS 

[102-15, 102-46, 102-47, 102-49, 

103-1]

Regular reviews of our material 

sustainability topics are conducted 

to ensure that we are focused on 

managing and reporting on the issues 

that matter most to our stakeholders 

and have the greatest impact on 

the long-term performance of our 

business. 

In 2019, we conducted an assessment 

of our material sustainability topics. 

This process, which was guided by 

a robust stakeholder engagement 

exercise, highlighted new and 

emerging topics and provided 

an opportunity for us to review 

whether we are focusing on the 

right issues. In 2021, we conducted 

an internal review, which entailed 

peer benchmarking and gathering 

feedback from selected internal 

stakeholders, and concluded that 

these topics remain relevant. See 

Appendix for more information.

YIELD AND EXTRACTION 

IMPROVEMENTS [103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

Among the vegetable oil crops, palm oil is unparalleled for 

its productivity and land-use efficiency. Used in everything 

from consumables to non-food products, the widespread 

popularity of palm oil has raised concerns over the 

environmental impacts of the industry. One of the  

most pressing concerns is the clearing of forested land  

for plantations. 

To protect the environment and ensure the long-

term success of our business, we continue to explore 

opportunities for more sustainable production through 

various research and development initiatives. A key area 

of opportunity is the improvement of yield and extraction 

rates, which can obviate the need to develop new land. 

YIELD AND EXTRACTION RATES 

Palm oil yield and extraction rates are dependent on a 

complex combination of factors including plantation age 

profile, weather changes, disease and pest management, soil 

type, fertiliser application, and harvesting efficiency. 

To maintain high yields, we ensure that the age profile 

of our oil palm plantations falls largely within the prime 

ages. Oil palms that exceed their prime age are scheduled 

for replanting. To improve productivity, we also employ 

practices such as:

• 

Replanting our fields with the higher-yielding planting 

materials we developed through research, allowing our 

crops to be harvested in two and a half years instead of 

three years;

• 

Customising fertilisation by plantation blocks to 

optimise nutritional uptake; 

• 

Employing more mechanised equipment such as 

fertiliser, herbicide and empty fruit bunch (EFB) 

spreaders to reduce our reliance on manual labour; and

• 

Transporting fresh fruit bunches (FFB) from the field to 

the main road by motorcycles instead of wheelbarrows.

In 2021, we observed a 5% increase in our FFB yield 

compared to the previous year, attesting to the efficacy 

of our enhanced replanting programme. Accordingly, 

the quality of our oil palm harvests improved as well. We 

were also able to decrease our oil losses by 0.24% through 

optimising the way we process FFBs at our mills. However, 

our overall crude palm oil (CPO) extraction rate declined 

from 23.2% in 2020 to 22.7% in 2021. The lower extraction 

rate is mainly attributed to increased sourcing of FFB 

from third-party suppliers and a higher proportion of FFB 

produced by our young palms. 

In the same year, we continued to provide support for 

our smallholders to help them increase their productivity. 

With operational support provided by First Resources, we 

observed an increase in our plasma smallholders'  FFB yield 

compared to the previous year. For more information on 

our engagement with smallholder farmers, please see the 

section on Supporting Smallholders.

In light of the encouraging progress we observed this year, 

we will continue to implement our replanting programme 

and further optimise the way we process FFBs.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

First Resources operates three dedicated Research and 

Development (R&amp;D) facilities – the First Resources Research 

Centre based in Riau, and two research stations in West and 

East Kalimantan. Our research primarily focuses on the 

topics of yield improvement and climate change resiliency. 

A major part of our research revolves around our oil palm 

breeding programme, which aims to develop planting 

materials with traits that optimise harvesting or increase 

palm oil density per hectare. Examples of desired traits 

include better oil quality, slower height increment, shorter 

frond length and more conspicuous colour changes 

during ripening. The breeding programme also seeks to 

develop resilient planting materials that can better cope 

with diseases such as basal stem rot disease caused by 

Ganoderma, and other impacts from climate change such as 

weather fluctuations. 

In 2021, we replanted approximately 3,000 hectares of our 

old oil palm trees with our new planting materials. The 

yield estimate from these enhanced planting materials 

is 20% higher compared to existing planting materials, 

allowing us to achieve greater overall productivity. These 

are our first generation of new planting materials and there 

are two varieties, the FR-1 and the FR-2. While we are still 

developing FR-3 as our third variety, its preliminary results 

have been both positive and promising. 

We have also been working with oil palm tissue culture to 

clone oil palms with desired characteristics. In 2020, we began 

planting trials with our clonal materials. While these clonal 

palms have been successfully transplanted from the nursery 

to the field, we continue to monitor their progress by making 

observations and noting their initial flowering period. 

We also partnered with the Indonesian Palm Oil Genome 

Consortium to research and develop varieties of planting 

material that are tolerant to Ganoderma. As part of this 

collaborative effort, we aim to identify and isolate the gene 

responsible for Ganoderma resistance. The achievement 

of this key milestone will allow us to springboard further 

research on Ganoderma-resistant oil palm varieties. In an 

ongoing effort to develop planting material with desirable 

traits, we screened 10 gene families from three varieties 

(avros, avros x calabar, and binga) in 2021.

CONSERVATION AND FOREST 

MANAGEMENT [103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

Indonesia is home to some of the world’s largest and most 

biodiverse rainforests. We recognise that the clearing of 

these forests for agriculture can result in the irreversible loss 

of invaluable biodiversity in addition to the release of stored 

carbon, which contributes to climate change. As such, we 

are committed to conserving and managing forests through 

the protection of High Conservation Value (HCV) areas, 

including riparian zones, as well as High Carbon Stock 

(HCS) forests and peatland.

IDENTIFYING CONSERVATION AREAS [304-4]

Our Policy on Sustainable Palm Oil articulates our 

commitment to no deforestation and no new development 

on peat areas. 

We strictly adhere to the New Planting Procedures (NPP) set 

by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), where 

all new developments within our plantations must undergo 

third-party HCV assessments conducted by RSPO approved 

assessors. The topics evaluated under these assessments 

include habitat quality, soil conditions, peat presence, river 

quality and community cultural identity. Our assessment 

results can be accessed on the RSPO website. 

Through these HCV assessments, we identified areas 

for conservation and excluded them from our oil palm 

plantation development plans. Rare and endangered 

species were also identified within our concessions and the 

surrounding areas through this process. See our website 

for the full list of identified threatened species under 

Indonesia’s National Law of Protected Species (MoEF 

Ministerial Regulation No. 106 of 2018), or under the 

International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List 

(IUCN Red List). 

Following the release of our Policy in 2015, we identified 

additional conservation areas by referencing the HCS 

Approach (HCSA) methodology and engaging third-party 

HCS experts. By 2017, we identified approximately 20,000 

hectares of land that contain potential HCS forests, HCV 

areas or peatlands. These lands were subsequently zoned  

for conservation.



All new land clearing for oil palm plantations will be 

preceded by an integrated High Conservation Value – High 

Carbon Stock Approach (HCV-HCSA) assessment. This 

policy shift was made in compliance with criterion 7.12 of 

the latest RSPO Principles and Criteria standards, which 

was released in November 2018. In 2020, the HCV-HCSA 

assessment was conducted for two of our concessions 

and underwent a quality control process under the HCV 

Network. In 2021, both assessments achieved a satisfactory 

rating from the HCV Network for the submitted reports. 

The detailed evaluation of both reports can be found on the 

HCV Network website. In 2022, we plan to conduct a HCV-

HCSA assessment for another concession.

PROTECTING CONSERVATION AREAS [304-1,304-2, 

304-3, 304-4]

Our sustainability team conducts pre and post development 

checks to ensure that only non-conservation areas are 

slated for new development. We also put in place buffer 

zones to mitigate the risks of accidental non-compliance. In 

addition, our plantation managers have key performance 

indicators tied to no development on conservation areas. 

For plantations located near riparian reserves, we take 

special precautions to avoid the accidental clearance of key 

conservation areas. 

We explicitly prohibit the hunting, injuring, possessing and 

killing of rare and endangered wildlife in our plantations. 

Employees who violate this policy will be disciplined with

punitive measures that may culminate in employment 

termination. To curb poaching, we also conduct daily 

monitoring patrols and place signboards as reminders at 

strategic locations. 

We identified populations of endangered orangutans in 

two of our concessions in West Kalimantan. For these 

concessions, our conservation taskforce works with a 

local non-governmental organisation (NGO) to manage 

vulnerable wildlife populations and conduct HCV 

monitoring with the aid of specialised conservation 

software. To monitor the population health of orangutans 

and other endangered species, we installed camera traps 

and organised joint patrols between members of our 

taskforce and the NGO. The results of these patrols were 

shared with the NGO to determine areas for improvement. 

To emphasise the importance of protecting HCV areas 

and HCS forests, internal training on conservation area 

management was conducted for our employees in Riau and 

East Kalimantan. In 2021, we trained a total of 67 employees 

across our estates. These training sessions were conducted 

virtually due to the prevailing COVID-19 travel restrictions. 

Many communities in Indonesia are still unfamiliar with 

the terms HCV and HCS, hence they may not support 

conservation practices. Given this, education is an 

important tool to bring these communities onboard with 

our sustainability goals. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 

pandemic, we were able to conduct HCV and HCS trainings 

for six villages in Riau and East Kalimantan for a total of 

116 participants. To protect our participants’ safety, training 

sessions were held in smaller groups with strict observance 

to safety measures. Depending on the conditions going 

forward, we aim to conduct engagements with at least two 

communities annually. 

In East Kalimantan, we partnered with the Technology 

Research and Development Agency of the Ministry of 

Environment and Forestry to identify strategies to conserve 

the Lembonah Forest in East Kalimantan. Following a 

2015 study, it was recommended that the forest be used to 

promote conservation awareness. Hence, we collaborated 

with the Agency to develop modules that educate children 

from nearby schools on the importance of conserving 

the Lembonah Forest. However, due to the COVID-19 

pandemic, we were unable to resume the programme in 

2021. While the Agency has since restructured into the 

Centre for the Implementation of Environmental and Forestry 

Instrument Standards - Samboja, we remain in close contact 

with the Centre to identify future collaboration opportunities. 

As part of our goals for 2022, we intend to conduct 

internal HCV and HCS training for our employees in nine 

plantations and reach out to another six villages to share the 

importance of wildlife conservation. 

REHABILITATING CONSERVATION AREAS [304-3]

Rehabilitation projects are being implemented to restore 

degraded HCV and HCS areas to their prior state. 

Restoration work commenced in the second half of 

2016 in one of the identified HCV areas at PT Limpah 

Sejahtera. Between 2016-2020, almost 21,000 forest 

trees have been planted in three of our concession areas, 

covering 69 hectares. In 2019, some of these areas were 

affected by forest fires which originated from outside our 

concessions, dampening our conservation efforts. In 2021, 

we rehabilitated 26 hectares of HCV areas by planting more 

than 7,900 forest trees, exceeding our target of 20 hectares.

Riparian reserves are areas of native forest along waterways 

that serve as critical habitats for bird communities and 

other wildlife populations. Under Indonesian law, riparian 

reserves and their adjacent buffer zones must be protected 

on both banks of the river. Recognising their significance as 

bulwarks against further biodiversity loss, we commenced 

restoration work for riparian reserves that were previously 

planted with mature oil palms in 2021. To restore these 

areas, we interspersed local tree species in the spaces 

between mature oil palms, which were left in place. 

In 2022, we aim to rehabilitate another 20 hectares of 

conservation area and monitor the progress of our existing 

restoration efforts.

PEAT MANAGEMENT [103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

Since the introduction of our Policy on Sustainable Palm 

Oil in 2015, First Resources has not carried out any new 

plantings on peatland at any depth. We implement best 

management practices for existing plantations located 

on peatlands. Peat areas which are deemed unsuitable 

for replanting will be restored or repurposed for 

environmentally beneficial alternative uses. 

We have assembled a specialised peat taskforce who 

conducts detailed peat surveys and peat assessments in our 

estates. The taskforce is led by our R&amp;D department and is 

supported by our agronomy and sustainability departments. 

Since 2019, peat surveys in all estates have been completed. 

The results from these peat surveys inform our land use 

planning and guide the enhancement of water management 

plans for our plantations on peat.

To minimise peat subsidence and the release of carbon 

dioxide, groundwater is maintained at optimal levels. We 

have installed piezometers and automatic data loggers 

that record data every 12 hours to monitor water table 

fluctuations. Since 2020, piezometers and data loggers 

have been fully installed in all estates located on peatlands. 

We regularly service our monitoring equipment and will 

continue to monitor the depth of the water table in the 

field. Collected hydrological data is periodically reported 

to the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry 

(MoEF) via an online reporting system, ensuring swift data 

transmission and compliance with regulations. 

We have also blocked canals and built water gates at selected 

estates to regulate and manage water levels, in accordance with 

guidelines stipulated by MoEF and the Indonesian Peatland 

Restoration Agency. In 2021, we collaborated with MoEF in 

an ongoing partnership to monitor the condition of the water 

table and manage peatland areas in one of our estates. We also 

participated in a training session conducted by MoEF on its 

reporting system and peat management best practices.  

In the same year, we installed peat subsidence poles in 

another two estates, and exceeded our  target by completing 

drainability assessments for another four estates. These 

peatland drainability assessments are mandatory under 

RSPO standards and must be conducted at least five years 

prior to the replanting of existing oil palms on peatlands. The 

results of these assessment are used to set the timeframe for 

future replanting and the eventual restoration of peatlands.

MoEF also encourages and supervises companies with 

operations on peatland to conduct field surveys for the 

compilation of a detailed inventory of peatland ecosystem 

characteristics. In compliance with these requirements, we 

conducted fieldwork surveys along verified transects and 

sampling points in one of our plantations. We will continue 

to work with the ministry to comply with the government’s 

policy regarding peatland management.

FIRE PREVENTION 

[103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

First Resources is 

committed to a strict 

Zero Burning policy 

when clearing land for 

new developments or 

replanting activities. This 

policy is also socialised 

with our suppliers, who 

are reminded that any 

deliberate breach may 

result in an immediate 

termination of contract. 

Launched in 2016, 

our Integrated Fire 

Management (IFM) 

programme delineates an 

in-depth workplan for fire 

prevention, preparedness, 

response, and recovery. 

Each estate has a Peta 

Rawan Kebakaran or 

Fire Prone Map which is 

updated annually to locate 

risk areas and available 

facilities. These facilities 

include roads, patrol 

paths, fire equipment 

store, fire lookout tower, 

water reservoirs/sources 

and warning signs. The 

location of villages and 

important telephone 

numbers are noted on 

the Fire Prone Map. Our 

patrol teams conduct 

regular checks on fire-

fighting facilities to ensure 

they remain operational.

1

Fire Danger Indices (FDI) 

are used to assess risk 

levels. The FDI has four 

levels: Low, Medium, 

High, and Extreme, 

depending on humidity, 

rain and fuel conditions. 

Fire risk levels are 

prominently displayed in 

fire prone areas during 

the hot and dry season to 

remind workers to remain 

vigilant. We will deploy 

routine patrol teams 

depending on the FDI level. 

During severe conditions, 

patrol teams are equipped 

with fire extinguishing 

equipment to extinguish 

any fires detected.

2

We conduct satellite 

monitoring daily, 

overlapping satellite 

imagery with our 

concession maps to detect 

any hotspots.

3

Once hotspots are 

detected, we carry out on-

the-ground verification by 

checking for the presence 

of smoke from fire lookout 

towers and by dispatching 

fire-fighting teams to 

affected areas. These 

towers are also important 

to assess fire conditions, for 

instance the movement of 

and size of the fire. We also 

work closely with external 

stakeholders such as the 

RSPO, who actively detects 

fire hotspots within RSPO 

members’ concessions. 

4

In the event of a fire 

outbreak, the firefighting 

team will be mobilised 

immediately, and a police 

report will be made for  

an investigation to be 

carried out.

In peat areas, we create firebreaks, prepare water sources/

reservoirs, build canal blockings and implement water 

management practices. During the dry season, we take 

further precautions by raising water levels in the peat area 

to prevent incoming fire and/or prevent fire from spreading. 

We have more than 1,500 firefighters assigned within our 

operations to ensure that fires are handled swiftly and 

adequately. In 2021, we provided refresher trainings to 

approximately 530 firefighters in 36 estates across Riau,  

West Kalimantan and East Kalimantan. These trainings 

were either conducted in-person or virtually. 

Land clearing using fire is prohibited in Indonesia. 

However, since 2009, communities who abide by their 

customary practices are exempt from this rule. In 2010, the 

Ministry of Environment issued a new ruling with regards 

to the prevention of environmental pollution caused by fire. 

Similar to the 2009 exemption rule, there are exceptions 

whereby each family is allowed to clear up to two hectares 

of land by fire on the grounds of their customary practices. 

Exemption for communities using fire for land clearing is 

also mentioned in the Law of the Republic of Indonesia 

Number 11 Year 2020, or more commonly known as 

Indonesia’s Omnibus Law.

In 2020, a local government regulation concerning land 

clearance by fire on the grounds of customary practices 

was introduced in West Kalimantan. To protect forests and 

prevent the spread of fire, communities who are permitted 

to clear land using fire must abide by rules such as:

• 

Clearing of land only for subsistence farming;

• 

Building of adequate firebreaks to prevent fire from 

spreading;

• 

Coordinating with owners of neighbouring lands;

• 

Ensuring fire extinguishing equipment is on standby; and 

• 

No burning on peatland.

These regulations have an impact on us as there are 

communities with ownership rights who live within or near 

our concession areas. It is therefore challenging to prevent 

communities from engaging in small-scale burning on areas 

within our concessions that are owned and controlled by 

the community. Such burning practices can result in fire 

events which are difficult to monitor and control as it is 

unknown when and where they will occur. 

As we expect fire incidences of such nature to continue,  

we seek to forge close partnerships with communities  

and local authorities in managing fire risks. This would 

include raising awareness about fire risks as well as fire 

management practices. 

In 2021, we aimed to reach out to nine villages for fire 

management and prevention training. However, we  

had to postpone such activities due to the ongoing 

COVID-19 pandemic. 

While we observed an overall decline in the number of  

fire outbreaks within our concession areas between 2020 

to 2021, the total affected area increased slightly, averaging 

around two hectares of affected land per incident. This 

increase in affected area may be due to burning practices  

by the community for land clearing purposes.

CLIMATE CHANGE [103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

Climate change is the defining crisis of our generation. 

As a palm oil company, we have a role to play in reducing 

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially from land 

use change. We must also continue to build our resilience 

against climate hazards such as changes in rainfall pattern, 

drought and extreme weather events, which may impact our 

yields and productivity. 

REDUCING OUR GHG EMISSIONS [305-5]

One of the biggest contributors of GHG emissions in the 

palm oil industry comes from the clearance of peatland 

and HCS forests for plantation development. To avoid 

the release of stored carbon into the atmosphere, First 

Resources does not undertake any new developments on 

HCS forests or peat areas at any depth. For more details on 

our approach, see the sections on Conservation and Forest 

Management, and Peat Management.

Palm oil mill effluent (POME), a wastewater generated 

from the processing of FFB, is a significant source of GHG 

emissions. Since 2014, we have been establishing methane 

capture facilities that treat POME in a closed system, 

capturing methane which would otherwise have been 

released into the atmosphere from open ponds.

1 

Data provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency Greenhouse Gas Equivalences Calculator 



Note: Number of methane capture facilities is based on the number of operational 

methane capture facilities per year. While the methane capture facility may only 

start operations in the middle of the year, the estimation of total GHG emission 

reduction is based on the full year CPO production where the mill is located. The CPO 

production is then multiplied by 0.51 tonne of CO2e for each tonne of CPO produced.

Total emission avoided (tCO2e) 

As at end 2021, we have operational methane capture 

facilities at seven of our mills. At six of these mills, the 

captured methane is used as an alternative fuel source for 

our milling operations. Our latest methane capture unit 

in West Kalimantan generates electricity to drive a power 

generator in our kernel crushing plant.



Based on the International Sustainability &amp; Carbon 

Certification (ISCC) calculation methodology, the 

estimated avoidance in GHG emissions for each facility is 

approximately 0.51 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent 

(tCO₂e) for each tonne of CPO produced. In 2021, the 

seven methane capture facilities collectively helped us to 

avoid approximately 180,000 tCO₂e in GHG emissions. This 

is equivalent to the annual emissions of 38,784 passenger 

vehicles driven for one year1.

In 2022, we plan to construct a methane capture plant for 

another mill. We expect that this methane capture facility 

will help us avoid an additional 28,000 tCO₂e in GHG 

emissions, equivalent to the annual emissions of 6,033 

passenger vehicles driven for one year1.

OUR OPERATIONAL FOOTPRINT 

[305-1, 305-2] 

Since 2020, we started using the latest RSPO PalmGHG 

calculator (version 4) to calculate our GHG emissions. 

With the new version, the GHG emissions indicators have 

been revised. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) have now 

been split into emissions from fertiliser use and from peat. 

Emissions from third-party FFB suppliers have also been 

extracted as a standalone indicator.

The total GHG emissions of a mill is obtained through the 

summation of emissions from the mill, supplying own and 

group plantations, and third-party FFB suppliers. For third-

Note: The emissions intensity ratio figures above include Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions from third-party plantations only. There are no indirect Scope 2 emissions as First 

Resources does not purchase any electricity from the grid for PT MSSP and PT SAM-1. 2018 and 2019 Data for PT SAM-1 is not available. The drop in emissions intensity for 

PT MSSP is due to the restructuring of our internal FFB supply chain, where a proportion of FFB previously supplied to the mill has been redirected to other mills which are 

located closer to the source. The slight increase in intensity for PT SAM-1 was due to the inclusion of PT ATS within the scope of calculations, since PT ATS has ceased its mill 

operations temporarily due to replanting activities at its plantations.  

Note: Fuel consumption from non-renewable sources include diesel for the operation 

of our vehicles, estates and mills. Conversion of volume to Gigajoules (GJ) is based 

on the CDP Technical Note: Conversion of fuel data to MWh. Fuel consumption 

from renewable sources include biomass (palm shell and fibre) and B30 biofuels for 

vehicles. Energy conversion value for biomass is based on a research paper titled 

“Palm Solid Wastes Potential Calculation for Renewable Energy with LCA Method". 

First Resources does not purchase any electricity from the grid.

reference value can be obtained from research, national 

value or based on the emission value of another plantation. 

The GHG data included in this report represents only  

two of our mills integrated with plantations that are RSPO 

certified. The mills are PT Meridan Sejatisurya Plantation 

(MSSP) and PT Subur Arummakmur 1 (SAM-1). Emissions 

from PT Arindo Trisejahtera (ATS) have been excluded 

from this report as it has temporarily ceased its mill 

operations due to replanting activities at its plantations. 

Our Scope 1 emissions for the two mills integrated with 

plantation in 2021 is 281,787 tCO2e. We do not have any 

indirect Scope 2 emissions as First Resources does not 

purchase any electricity from the grid. 

Going forward, we plan to establish a baseline for 

monitoring our emissions reduction performance across 

all our operations in line with the GHG Protocol, the most 

widely used GHG accounting standard.

WATER AND WASTE MANAGEMENT   

[103-1]

The health of our people and the planet hinges on 

the implementation of responsible consumption and 

production practices. At First Resources, we embody our 

commitment to responsible consumption and production 

by managing our water use and discharge, and reusing, 

recovering, or recycling the waste generated from our 

operations where possible. 

WATER MANAGEMENT [103-2, 103-3, 303-1] 

At our mills, a large proportion of the water we use is for 

the processing of FFB. All of the water used at our mills is 

drawn from groundwater or nearby rivers, which are shared 

with our employees’ houses as well as any of our plantation 

offices and housing in the vicinity. Water is also drawn for 

nursery irrigation. We have not identified any communities 

or other companies located near our mills which share 

the same water source. In 2021, a total of 3,677,740 cubic 

metres (m3) of water was withdrawn from the ground or 

nearby rivers for our operations. 

Our oil palm plantations are 100% rain-fed. Where 

plantations are located on marginal land with steep slopes and 

limited rainfall, drains are constructed to capture rainwater. 

We strive to minimise our water footprint by reusing water 

whenever possible. In 2021, we reused a total of 294,941 

m3 of water from our cooling systems. In the same year, 

we recycled another 770,054 m3 of steriliser condensate 

produced during the sterilisation of FFB in the CPO 

dilution process. By automating mill processes, reusing 

water and monitoring the efficiency of its consumption,  

we were able to achieve our water consumption intensity 

target of 1.0 m3 per tonne of FFB processed for all our mills 

in 2021. 

To minimise water consumption, we are optimising the 

configuration of a three-stage Light Tenera Dry Separator 

(LTDS-3) system in some of our milling operations. Once 

the quality of the kernel has been assessed to have met 

our standards with the use of a three-stage LTDS, we will 

bypass the clay-bath station, so as to minimise water use 

and eliminate the use of calcium-based chemicals. While 

this system is still being trialled, early results indicate that the 

LTDS-3 system can reduce water usage by 0.04 m3 per tonne 

of FFB processed without compromising on product quality.

Going forward, we will continue to monitor our water usage  

and identify opportunities to reduce the volume of water 

drawn from rivers.

WASTE AND EFFLUENTS MANAGEMENT 

[103-2, 103-3, 303-2, 303-4, 306-3] 

The main waste products from our milling process include 

organic solid plantation waste such as Empty Fruit Bunch 

(EFB), fibres, shells, and Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME), 

which are predominantly reused, recovered and recycled. 

EFB is applied as mulch in the plantations to conserve soil 

moisture, improve soil fertility, and reduce weed growth. 

Fibres and shells are used to generate power in our palm oil 

mills and refineries. In the plantations, oil palm trunks from 

replanting and oil palm fronds from pruning are left in situ 

to decompose and enhance soil fertility. We will continue to 

reuse the bulk of our organic waste. Non-hazardous waste 

generated downstream such as filter bags and cartridges are 

collected and disposed by local licensed waste collectors. 

We ensure that any effluent discharges comply with the 

quality limits for priority substances of concern as defined 

by the relevant local authorities. 

To minimise effluent discharge, the POME we generate is 

repurposed as organic fertiliser, which reduces our need 

for commercial fertilisers. For land application of treated 

POME, its biological oxygen demand (BOD) level is kept 

below the legal threshold of 5,000 milligrams per litre. 

Given that our mill in Bangsal Aceh is not integrated with a 

plantation unlike our other mills, treated POME is discharged 

to the sea instead. While we observed an increase in the BOD of 

treated POME discharged to sea in Riau, the level is kept below 

the legal threshold of 100 milligrams per litre. There were no 

incidents of non-compliance with discharge limits in 2021.

HAZARDOUS WASTE 

Hazardous waste generated from our operations include 

pesticide packaging, expired pesticides, used batteries, used 

lubricants and filters, empty paint cans, printer cartridges, 

and needles from our health clinics. We also have power 

plants at our palm oil processing complexes, which supply 

electricity to our factories and facilities. Coal and EFB fibre 

are used as fuel in our power plants, which produce fly ash 

and bottom ash as waste. Spent bleaching earth (SBE) is a 

solid waste generated from our refineries. 

All hazardous waste is segregated, labelled, and stored within 

secure, fire resistant temporary storage facilities that are 

equipped with spillage containment kits, alarms, firefighting 

equipment and first aid kits. We also put in place operational 

procedures which cover leakage handling. These facilities  

are inspected weekly. Hazardous waste is collected by 

licensed third-parties for proper disposal in accordance with 

national legislations.

of Environment. The objective is to 

promote industrial compliance with 

pollution control regulations, facilitate 

and enforce the adoption of practices 

contributing to cleaner technologies, 

and ensure a better environmental 

management system. 

The programme uses a colour-coded 

rating system to determine performance, 

as per the rating categories below. Areas 

assessed include: air and water pollution 

control, hazardous waste management, 

environmental management system, 

implementation of Environmental Impact 

Assessment, community development 

and conservation of resources. 

Between 2020-2021, seven mills were 

awarded the Blue rating, whereas one 

received the Red rating. This was due to 

our plantation concession overlapping with 

the construction site of the Pekanbaru-

Dumai toll road, a government project. 

Moreover, the project passed through a 

designated area where we use POME as 

an organic fertiliser. As a result, we had 

to move the designated location, including 

the related permits. The licensing process 

is underway. While regrettable, this Red 

rating was expected as we could not obtain 

the new permit in time for the 2020-2021 

PROPER auditing period. Nevertheless, 

we will continue to work with the relevant 

authorities to expedite the permit approval.

RATING CATEGORIES 

Gold

EXCELLENT: 

For businesses/activities that have successfully displayed environmental 

management effort and achieved excellent results.

Green

GOOD: 

For businesses/activities that have displayed environmental management effort 

and achieved results better than those required by regulation.

Blue

ADEQUATE: 

For businesses/activities that have displayed environmental management 

effort, and have achieved the minimum standard required by regulation.

Red

POOR: 

For businesses/activities that have displayed environmental management effort, 

but have achieved only parts of the minimum standard required by regulation.

Black 

VERY POOR: 

For businesses/activities that do not display significant environmental 

management effort.

PEST MANAGEMENT AND CHEMICAL 

USAGE [103-1,103-2, 103-3] 

We maintain our high yields and land-use efficiency by 

carefully nourishing and protecting our crops. Where 

possible, we use biological pest control methods and organic 

fertilisers derived from our waste products. Depending on 

the situation, these methods may not be sufficiently effective. 

For example, the use of organic fertilisers is insufficient to 

meet the nutritional requirements of oil palms, thereby 

necessitating the use of inorganic fertilisers. Without careful 

management, the application of such chemicals may pose 

a risk to workers and the environment. We are therefore 

committed to managing these risks through the adoption of 

agronomic best practices.  

INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT 

Our integrated pest management strategy includes a 

combination of biological controls as well as good agricultural 

practices such as selecting the right pesticides and controlling 

dosage. Barn owls (Tyto alba) are introduced in our plantations 

to control the rat population. To increase the population of 

barn owls in our young estates, we have implemented breeding 

projects in Riau and Kalimantan. We also plant crops such as 

Cassia cobanensis, Antigonon leptopus, and Turnera ubulate, 

which attract the predators of oil palm leaf-eating pests such as 

bagworms and nettle caterpillars. Other biological agents such 

as Cordyceps fungus are also used during nettle caterpillar 

outbreaks. We also use Trichoderma, which we grow ourselves, 

as a bio-fungicide to control Ganoderma. 

Where pesticides are required, we monitor their usage and 

ensure they are permitted by the Ministry of Agriculture 

in Indonesia. These pesticides are available in either solid 

or liquid form. Some pesticides are also used in the form 

of pre-formulated mixtures and their classification is set by 

the manufacturer as per the World Health Organisation’s 

(WHO) guidelines. 

We are currently exploring ways to reduce herbicide waste 

and usage by increasing herbicide efficacy on weeds. In 

2020, we developed a technique that reduces the quantity of 

glyphosate-based herbicide administered in our plantations 

by a margin of 50%. This was achieved by mixing the 

herbicide with catalysts and adjuvants to optimise 

absorption, ensuring that less chemicals are introduced 

into the environment, while reducing the risk of workplace 

chemical exposure. Once weed succession and control is 

observed, these glyphosate-based herbicides are phased out.

Through extensive research, we were also able to reduce the 

frequency of herbicide application from every three months 

to every four to six months. We are currently assessing the 

possibility of using pesticide with lower toxicity levels.

A common pest encountered during the replanting stage is 

the rhinoceros beetle, which feeds on the soft young shoots

of immature oil palms. To control its population, we employ 

a three-pronged approach: the spraying of insecticides on 

young palm; the use of sex pheromones to attract and trap 

the beetles; and the use of fungus to kill the beetle’s larvae.

We only use the WHO’s Class 1A or 1B pesticides in specific 

and urgent situations, such as during a bagworm outbreak as 

biological methods will not be sufficiently effective. Adequate 

safety measures such as the use of personal protective 

equipment (PPE) are put in place to prevent any long-term 

health issues for our workers when using Class 1 chemicals.

Paraquat Phase-out

Since 2020, we have phased out the use of paraquat, a chemical 

herbicide with concerns on its high toxicity levels and the 

potential of misuse. Prior to phasing out paraquat, we needed 

to conduct research trials to identify suitable alternative 

herbicides. Spanning several months, these research trials 

involved testing different herbicide-weed permutations over 

a variety of conditions. We identified suitable alternatives 

but found that they came with an increased cost of more than 

50% compared to paraquat. However, we recognise that this 

is a necessary step to take to protect the environment as well 

as the health and safety of our employees. The decision was 

thus taken to phase out the use of paraquat. 

FERTILISER USAGE

The use of fertilisers in the field depends on total 

new plantings as well as the total hectarage of mature 

plantations, with oil palm plantings in their prime-yielding 

age requiring a higher input of nutrients. We aim to use 

organic fertilisers derived from waste products to the 

maximum extent possible. In 2021, 95% of our POME and 

EFB produced were reused as organic fertilisers in the field. 

To reduce runoff and protect the environment, we 

established fertiliser application guidelines that maximise 

resource efficiency by ensuring adequate intervals between 

application cycles and avoiding periods of high rainfall. 

We also developed internal standard operating procedures 

that prevent the application of fertilisers and chemicals in 

riparian buffer zones. 

We continued to conduct research to increase the efficiency 

of fertiliser application within our plantations. This includes 

fine-tuning dosage recommendations for different areas 

which may have different requirements due to variations 

in terrain, soil type, and microclimates. While urea is 

gaining traction as an alternative nitrogen fertiliser, its 

post-application volatility renders its usage challenging 

in an industrial setting. To circumvent this, we have been 

piloting the use of urease inhibitors in our Riau plantations 

to increase the amount of urea available for uptake. If 

successful, this two-year trial would increase fertilisation 

efficacy and reduce GHG emissions in our plantations. 

Workers who handle chemicals within our operations are 

required to undergo regular trainings which are conducted 

by field and R&amp;D staff, learning centres and chemical 

vendors. The training sessions cover proper package 

handling, mixing chemicals solutions from concentrate, using 

chemical application tools and evaluating the success rate of 

application. We also ensure that adequate PPEs are provided 

and used on site. First Resources does not use chemicals 

listed under the Stockholm or Rotterdam Conventions. 

While there is a higher proportion of inorganic fertiliser 

application on our younger plantings, an overall reduction 

in proportion is observed for plantations with a more 

mature profile. There will be a decrease in inorganic fertiliser 

application as our younger plantations reach maturity. 

Going forward, we will continue to optimise our fertiliser 

use with further research on fertiliser application at  

specific sites, and implement of the “4 Rights” in manuring 

(right source, right dosage, right time, and right place).

RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS AND LOCAL 

COMMUNITIES [103-1, 103-2, 103-3] 

We recognise that the rights and livelihoods of local 

indigenous communities may be undermined if land 

acquisition for new developments is improperly handled. 

To maintain positive relations with the local communities 

within which we operate, we pledge to uphold their rights 

by initiating constructive engagements and observing 

proper land acquisition procedures. 

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT [413-1] 

We conduct social impact assessments during the planning 

phase of all new developments to guide our future 

community engagements. We consult local communities as 

part of these assessments to share our findings and gather 

feedback for improvements. These assessments provide 

inputs for the planning and implementation of programmes 

that can support positive outcomes while mitigating any 

negative impacts that may result from our operations. 

In line with our Policy on Sustainable Palm Oil, we are 

committed to respecting the rights of indigenous and local 

communities to give or withhold their Free, Prior and 

Informed Consent (FPIC) for the utilisation of land to which 

they hold legal or customary rights. Throughout the project 

development cycle, we actively engage our communities 

through public consultations and similar outreach activities. 

Where there are conflicts with or grievances raised by local 

communities, we ensure that these are resolved in an open, 

transparent and consultative manner. 

In 2021, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) 

conducted public consultations to solicit feedback for the 

draft revision to their 2015 FPIC Guide. We are currently 

reviewing these revised guidelines with the aim of 

enhancing the FPIC procedures within our own operations. 

As part of our community engagement initiatives, we also 

collaborated with the Indonesian Oil Palm Smallholders 

Association (APKASINDO) to conduct a training session 

on the palm oil industry. Held in Pekanbaru, Riau, the 

training session aims to equip journalists with sufficient 

knowledge to support positive oil palm campaigns. 

LAND COMPENSATION AND CONFLICT 

RESOLUTION [411-1, 413-2] 

The processes to settle land rights and compensation are 

extremely complex in Indonesia as they are governed by 

overlapping national and provincial laws. Customary and 

indigenous land claims may be undefined and conflicting 

with the current legal context. Moreover, the identification 

of land ownership can be challenging due to the common 

practice of shifting cultivations. 

Upon being granted a location permit (Ijin lokasi) for a new 

development, we will first identify the land that belongs to 

individuals within the local community. This is followed 

by a socialisation process which usually covers various key 

aspects designed to inform communities about: 

• 

The company’s permit granted by the government; 

• 

The government’s and company’s land compensation 

policies; 

• 

The development plans; 

• 

The approach for land measurement; 

• 

Land valuation approaches; and 

• 

The process for verifying land ownership and the 

requirements for proof of ownership. 

Following socialisation and the completion of due diligence, 

compensation is made to communities who have accepted 

the company’s offer for their land. All land transfers are 

documented and witnessed by members of the local 

government and community leaders. 

Disputes involving rightful land ownership are amongst the 

most common conflicts that we encounter. Stakeholders 

may raise grievances involving land ownership through 

our grievance procedure. We are committed to resolving 

them in a responsive manner and through a process that 

is consultative, fair and transparent. Our grievance list is 

updated regularly and is available on our website.

COMMUNITY INVESTMENT [103-1, 103-2, 

103-3, 203-1, 203-2] 

The palm oil sector plays an important role in the Indonesian 

economy, lifting rural communities out of poverty through 

the creation of jobs and the provision of infrastructure. First 

Resources employs a large proportion of our workforce from 

local communities, which are often located in isolated areas 

that lack basic infrastructure and services. To help drive 

positive socio-economic impact in areas where we operate, 

we implement community development programmes centred 

on education, healthcare, infrastructure and alternative 

livelihoods, in addition to providing disaster relief.

Our Community Development Officers (CDOs) are the 

main liaison between our Company and community 

members. CDOs engage with local residents on a regular 

basis to build relationships and understand community 

members’ concerns and needs. A CDO’s typical task 

includes collecting data on living conditions and population 

numbers, brainstorming new development ideas with 

community members, designing and proposing new 

programmes to regional managers and sustainability 

coordinators, and implementing local projects. CDOs 

also act as ambassadors, engaging with local government 

agencies to present and explain First Resources’ operational 

activities, environmental initiatives and social programmes.

In 2021, Sintang (West Kalimantan) and Kampar 

(Riau) were hit by several episodes of heavy rainfall, 

triggering severe flooding. We contributed to the relief 

effort by donating necessities and by furnishing affected 

communities with much-needed provisions during this 

critical juncture. 

We also contributed Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) 4 billion 

to the Huria Kristen Batak Protestant (HKBP) church 

organisation. The amount donated will be used by the 

church to organise social activities for the congregation and 

community, especially in the Sumatra region.

SUPPORTING LOCAL COMMUNITIES DURING THE 

COVID-19 PANDEMIC 

With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic impacting livelihoods 

in Indonesia, First Resources is committed to doing its 

part to support local communities. In 2021, we donated 

approximately 40,000 sacks of rice worth IDR 1.8 billion to 

ease the economic burden of communities whose livelihoods 

were disrupted by the pandemic.

As a continuation of our contributions to civil society 

organisations last year, we donated another IDR 2 billion 

to the Tzu Chi Foundation. The money was used for the 

purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE), medical 

equipment, food and other necessities. At the regency level, 

we provided PPE and food staples such as rice, cooking oil 

and sugar to communities located near our plantations. 

For areas located further away from our operations, we 

collaborated with local authorities to distribute these 

provisions to community members. We also arranged 

vaccinations for all our employees, their loved ones and 

the surrounding  communities to help raise the national 

vaccination rate. When a surge in COVID-19 cases 

overburdened Indonesian hospitals last year, oxygen supplies 

across the country were rapidly depleted. In response, First 

Resources stepped in as a corporate donor to the “Indonesia 

Pasti Bisa Jaga Oksigen” programme, contributing IDR 435 

million to finance the purchase of additional oxygen supplies. 

During the height of the pandemic in India, First Resources 

also extended its aid to the global community by donating 350 

oxygen cylinders worth IDR 500 million.

EDUCATION 

Access to quality education enables social mobility and 

reduces inequalities. To support social development, First 

Resources is working to increase such access for both 

current and future generations of children. We currently 

support 38 schools where the children of our employees 

go to, all of which are located within or near our oil palm 

estates. These include two preschools, 14 kindergartens, 19 

elementary schools and three junior high schools. These 

institutions employ more than 400 teachers and educate 

over 5,900 students. The curriculum adopted is similar 

to that of schools managed by the local government. We 

contribute to the schools’ facilities and teaching aids, such 

as furniture, electricity generators and books. In 2021, we 

furnished our schools with critical facilities such as office 

computers and additional desks and chairs. We also carried 

out roof maintenance and freshened one of the school’s 

façade with a new coat of paint.  

All children of employees working in our estates are provided 

with free education at our schools. Scholarships are awarded 

to high-scoring children from less privileged families, 

selected by local education authorities. In 2021, we allocated 

and invested approximately IDR 8.5 billion to support the 

the education of children. This includes IDR 5 billion to 

support the Institute of Character Education/Pendidikan 

Holistik Berbasi Karakter (ICE-PHBK) in Depok, West 

Java, which aims to help them construct a campus building 

which is expected to accommodate up to 3,000 students.



First Resources has also established an internship 

programme that is run in collaboration with more than 30 

Indonesian universities. The programme offers students an 

opportunity to apply what they have learned in university, 

expand their knowledge and benefit from valuable on-

the-job experience. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 

pandemic,  we have temporarily paused our internship 

programme since June 2020.

HEALTHCARE 

We have a total of 11 health clinics staffed with qualified 

medical professionals, including at least one doctor and two 

nurses in each facility. The primary purpose of these clinics 

is to serve our employees and their families, but they are also 

open to local community members. The operating hours of 

our clinics are longer than those of the health posts managed 

by the local government. We also have 24 first-aid centres 

which are set up for emergencies. 

Medical services such as immunisations for polio, 

measles and tuberculosis are available to communities 

upon request. Our clinics started offering COVID-19 

vaccinations as part of our wider COVID-19 relief efforts 

to support the national vaccination programme. We have 

also established health-related community programmes 

to improve the wellbeing of local residents and increase 

their awareness about the benefits of healthy living. Carried 

out in collaboration with local health authorities, the “Be 

Healthy with First Resources” programme coordinates 

blood donation drives and offers health treatments and 

advice for children, pregnant women and the elderly. These 

programmes are currently suspended due to the COVID-19 

pandemic and will resume when conditions allow. 

INFRASTRUCTURE 

A better infrastructure system not only helps us to run our 

operations more efficiently, but also increases the mobility of 

local communities, thereby improving access to healthcare, 

educational facilities and markets. 







Before undertaking any infrastructure project, First 

Resources will consult with local village leaders to better 

understand the needs of the community. The roads servicing 

our operating areas, which we share with local communities, 

are kept in good condition to minimise disruptions and 

maintain strong links to the main transport network. In 2021, 

we repaired over 129 kilometres of roads which connects 

villages located near our operations to the town centre. 

We also funded the repair of three mosques and the 

construction of four bridges as part of our infrastructure 

development projects this year. One of the bridges is a 

suspension type, which is located in Kepayang Village, Rokan 

Hulu, Riau. Upon completion, the bridge will connect two 

separate parts of the village. Beyond roads and bridges, 

we also provided materials for the construction of critical 

infrastructure such as electricity poles in West Kalimantan, 

and clean water supply system in East Kalimantan. To 

enhance liveability and wellbeing, we provided a monetary 

contribution to the  government for the redevelopment of 

Taman Paso in Jagakarsa, South Jakarta, into a city park for 

public recreation. 

ALTERNATIVE LIVELIHOODS 

We often receive requests for support from community 

members, especially mothers and young adults who would 

like to start their home businesses such as selling food items 

like cassava crackers. Since 2015, First Resources has been 

providing start-up capital as well as raw materials to help 

these community members start their business, providing 

an alternative income source to improve their livelihoods. 

In addition to socio-economic benefits, these alternative 

livelihood projects can help promote forest conservation 

as the local communities are less likely to engage in forest 

clearing activities.

EMPLOYEE ATTRACTION, RETENTION 

AND DEVELOPMENT [103-1,103-2,103-3]

Talent acquisition and retention forms the cornerstone 

of the long-term success of our business. We must adopt 

novel ways of attracting talent, especially millennials, 

and overcome the increasing competition over labour. 

This includes ensuring that we provide competitive 

compensation and rewarding career opportunities. The 

integration of digital technologies also grants us an edge in 

attracting a new generation of employees and improving 

overall efficiency. As employers, we continue to promote a 

fair and favourable working environment that supports the 

growth of all employees.

EMPLOYEE PROFILE [102-8, 401-1]

We directly employ 21,779 employees across our offices, 

plantations, mills and processing plants, 18,558 of whom are 

permanent employees and 3,221 are temporary employees.

To support our operations, some of our workers are 

sourced through third-party contractors, including 

seasonal workers, security guards and those needed for 

special construction projects. Other seasonal workers are 

contracted during peak harvesting seasons. Some of these 

workers are the spouses of our existing employees, while 

other workers are residents of nearby communities who 

prefer seasonal employment arrangements for the flexibility 

to engage in other work.

Our new hire and turnover rates are mainly attributed  

to harvesters, who tend to prefer plantations with younger 

and shorter oil palm trees as the work is less strenuous 

and risky. Regardless, First Resources possesses sufficient 

manpower reserves to buffer against unforeseen labour 

shortages. Among other strategies, we recruit the  

children of our harvesters and foremen once they have 

come of age as they are already familiar with the culture 

in the estates. We also recruit additional manpower from 

neighbouring communities.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS [401-2]

Our permanent employees receive benefits which include 

life and health insurance coverage and annual bonus, which 

is determined by the Group and individual's performance. 

We also provide housing for all our plantation and mill 

employees. Through our programme called “17 Kehidupan 

Pondok”, we identified 17 areas of needs for workers living 

in the estates, including access to provisions as well as 

facilities and amenities that meet their needs. 

In addition to housing and sanitation, employees also  

have access to running water, electricity, medical care, 

sports and recreational facilities, and places of worship. 

Access to education for employees’ children, such as 

kindergartens and schools, day care centres, and school 

buses are also provided. More information on how we 

support education for our employees' children can be found 

in the section on Education. 

As mills and plantations are often located far from towns, 

transportation is provided for workers to go to town over 

the weekends. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 

we regulated all unnecessary travel to prevent transmission 

of the virus and arranged COVID-19 vaccinations for 

our employees. We continued to ensure that cooperatives 

or shops within the plantations adhere to safe distancing 

measures and are sufficiently stocked, providing our 

employees with safe access to daily necessities.

TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT [404-2] 

Our Learning Centre runs five graduate training programmes 

for field assistants, palm oil mill assistants and administrative 

assistants. Spanning five to six months, these programmes 

cover the technical, managerial and interactive skills required 

to work in First Resources’ estates and palm oil mills. As 

these programmes take up to six months, the Learning 

Centre also provides accommodation for trainees. A plot of 

oil palm plantation is made available for the trainees to gain 

first-hand experience in plantation operations. 

Every year, through our People Development Review, 

we assess the training needs of our employees which is 

prioritised in line with the Group’s business and operational 

requirements. We also conduct regular trainings for 

field assistants, mill assistants, administration assistants 

and foremen to ensure that they can carry out their jobs 

effectively and safely. We provide trainings on topics 

such as harvesting management, fertiliser management, 

e-plantation systems, problem solving, decision-making 

and other soft skills on an as-needed basis. All trainings 

are conducted by First Resources coaches and specialist 

vendors, while continual on-the-job training and 

mentorships are provided by managers and supervisors.

With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have had to 

conduct our trainings virtually due to travel restrictions and 

safe-distancing measures. While it is more efficient in terms 

of time and resources required, it is difficult to assess the 

effectiveness of the online training sessions compared to a 

classroom setting, which allows for more interaction. There

were also certain trainings that could not be conducted, 

especially those which require social interaction and field 

work. We will continue to review our training programmes 

to determine the most suitable format of delivery and how 

to best conduct virtual trainings. 

As part of our recruitment drive, we formed partnerships with 

universities in Java and Sumatra to provide internships for 

undergraduates and vocational school students. Our internship 

programme exposes students to administrative duties, 

plantation activities and palm oil mill operations. Apart from 

allowing students to gain experience with the Company, the 

internship programme also provides an opportunity for us to 

identify potential candidates for a permanent role in the future. 

To retain and develop high potential employees as future 

leaders of the Company, First Resources has established a 

career path system which offers different progression tracks. 

This is to ensure that all employees have the opportunity to 

develop at their preferred pace, while allowing ambitious 

and high-performing employees to progress faster. The 

People Development Review is also used to assess each 

employee’s performance annually, monitor their progress 

and facilitate their career development. 

In 2021, we developed a suite of applications to streamline 

internal communication and administration. This includes 

Informance, a digital employee feedback application that 

is linked to the First Resources Learning Centre portal for 

employees to access educational modules, and the Human 

Resources Information System, which is a one-stop web 

application for employees to access personal information 

and relevant forms. While our applications have been 

well-received by our employees, we will continue to make 

improvements by converting them into mobile format.

We also organised a series of informative webinars to 

inspire and boost the morale of our employees. Our guest 

speakers this year included Merry Riana, a renowned 

motivational speaker, and Prita Ghozie, a financial 

consultant and lecturer at the University of Indonesia. 

Beyond webinars, we also organised the First Resources 

Learning Festival to challenge employees to develop 

innovative solutions for a company-wide competition. 

Note: Staff and workers include assistant managers, clerks, foremen, officers and other workers.

GENDER EQUALITY AND INCLUSION 

[103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 405-1]

Women play a critical role in the agricultural sector of 

developing countries but continue to face constraints that 

limit their inclusion. Employment in plantations continues 

to be male-dominated, stemming from entrenched cultural 

norms that cast men as breadwinners and women as 

homemakers. As a result of these norms, women have 

had less access than men to resources and opportunities, 

including land, financial services and education. 

At First Resources, we are committed to providing job 

opportunities based on competence, skills and experience, 

regardless of gender, ethnicity, race or religion. Due to 

the physically intensive nature of oil palm cultivation and 

processing, most of our plantation and mill workers are

men. Men are typically assigned heavier physical tasks, for 

example, harvesting and carrying fresh fruit bunches to 

trucks for transportation. Women are typically assigned 

tasks such as weeding, fertilising and collecting oil palm 

loose fruits that have fallen to the ground. 

To support our female workers, we have implemented 

several measures. These include the reassignment of tasks  

if they are pregnant to ensure their health is protected. 

All of our female permanent workers are also entitled to 

maternity and menstrual leave. To protect their safety, 

women are also assigned work that do not require them 

to be alone. Employees can raise complaints related to 

discrimination or harassment anonymously through our 

whistleblowing procedure.

First Resources will continue to support the career 

development of female employees in our corporate office. 

We are pleased to announce the promotions of several 

female employees to the position of department heads.

LABOUR CONDITIONS AND HUMAN 

RIGHTS [103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

Labour and human rights remain a complex challenge 

which needs to be addressed across the supply chain. At 

First Resources, we prohibit the use of forced, trafficked 

or child labour and respect the workplace rights of all our 

employees, including temporary workers. 



FORCED OR COMPULSORY LABOUR AND CHILD 

LABOUR [408-1, 409-1]

In accordance with national labour laws and regulations, 

the Group does not tolerate forced or bonded labour, or the 

employment of under-aged workers. 

We ensure that employees at our plantation and mill 

operations are never subject to the unlawful withholding 

of wages, identification cards, passports or other travel 

documents without their consent. Where we have 

outsourced our manpower needs to external agencies,  

we will brief these middlemen on our policies and  

practices. We will cease working with agencies who  

breach our policies. 

These external agencies will assist to identify and  

coordinate the recruitment of potential workers who are 

importantly, above 18 years of age. We will then meet and 

select the candidates. During this meeting, the Company 

will socialise and explain to the candidates the job 

requirements as well as the terms and conditions of the 

job such as wages, type of work, benefits, housing, and 

insurance. In line with our recruitment policies, work 

practices and procedures, we ensure that all employees 

understand their rights and obligations. 

As some of our workers have families with them in the 

estates, we established a monitoring system to ensure that 

their under-aged children do not assist in the estate work, 

a common practice in many parts of Indonesia. We also 

display signboards to remind parents not to bring their 

children to the plantations, socialise the importance of 

education, and provide educational facilities such as child-

care centres and access to schools. Constant reminders are 

sent to all workers and warnings are issued to those who 

violate our policies.

In 2021, we collaborated with our customer Wilmar 

and its partner Nestle as well as the Business for Social 

Responsibility (BSR) and The Centre for Child Rights 

and Business to plan a training session. This session was 

developed for our estate managers as well as our Human 

Resources, Sustainability and General Affairs managers on 

the topic of child protection. The objective of the session 

is to create a better understanding of contemporary child 

rights issues and the challenges present in the palm oil 

sector. The training also aims to cover what companies can 

do to mitigate issues related to child rights. This training 

session, originally planned for 2021, was delayed and will be 

conducted in early 2022.

FAIR WAGES

First Resources complies with the minimum wage regulated 

by the respective province or district where we operate. 

Wages are regularly updated based on new guidelines or 

revisions to the relevant existing agreements according to 

the Regulation Law of the Republic of Indonesia No. 11 of 

2020 on Job Creation (Undang-Undang Cipta Kerja). To 

supplement their wages, our employees are fairly remunerated 

with a variety of in-kind benefits such as housing and utilities. 

For more details, see the section on Employee Benefits.

We acknowledge that groundwork conditions vary 

depending on the environment. For example, hilly terrains 

will require more time to reach the same work target 

compared to an environment with flat terrain. Such working 

conditions are considered to ensure fair compensation. It 

is also not uncommon for our workers to earn more than 

their minimum wage due to volume-based incentive pay. 

We keep records of all salaries paid to our employees and 

contractors, and we do not withhold payment of wages. 

These records are acknowledged by the payees and we 

provide clarification to ensure that they understand how the 

payments have been calculated. We also ensure that payslips 

provided to workers are standardised and present the 

necessary information in a way that is easy to understand. 

Overtime work undertaken by the workers is voluntary and 

they will be compensated accordingly.

For our RSPO certified plantations, we ensure that the 

aggregate value of employee benefits and wages exceeds 

the prevailing minimum wage. In the future, we are also 

exploring the possibility of conducting a Decent Living 

Wage study on our RSPO certified plantations.

FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND COLLECTIVE 

BARGAINING [102-41]

We support the freedom of all our employees to form 

unions as a channel to communicate their expectations and 

aspirations. We provide office space where they can conduct 

their meetings. 

Each subsidiary and its labour union representatives have 

agreed on a Collective Labour Agreement that aims to 

protect the rights and obligations of employees and their 

employer. All our employees are protected by the Collective 

Labour Agreement, which covers industrial relations, 

working hours, remuneration, out-of-post assignments and 

transfers, social security and welfare, occupational health 

and safety, and employment termination. These agreements 

will be renewed every two years. Prior to renewal, the 

Group will meet with the labour union to identify 

improvements required. 

We hold focus group discussions and meetings together 

with labour unions periodically, and actively involve them in 

decision-making during the formulation of new management 

policies. These dialogues enable us to take into consideration 

the aspirations of our employees and solicit their suggestions, 

inputs and criticisms. Employees are also able to convey their 

aspirations through the Human Resources Department. The 

Group communicates all changes related to employment via 

emails, circulars, or our internal portal. 

In 2021, we involved the labour union in our discussions 

over the “House Ownership Credit” programme, which 

is a joint effort between First Resources, the Indonesian 

Palm Oil Association (IPOA) / Gabungan Pengusaha 

Kelapa Sawit Indonesia (GAPKI) and participating banks 

to facilitate home ownership among our employees. 

We also involved the labour union in meetings on the 

implementation of the National Health Insurance policy.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

[103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 403-1]

Protecting human life and providing a safe working 

environment that exemplifies the highest standards 

of occupational health and safety is a fundamental 

responsibility of any company. It is an important aspect 

of maintaining smooth operations and optimal employee 

productivity. To reduce the risks of health and safety 

incidents within our operations, we have implemented 

an Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management 

System for all our operations, covering all employees. 

Workers are consulted on the development of this 

management system, which is based on the Occupational 

Health and Safety Management System (ISO 45001:2018) 

and complies with local regulatory requirements. To 

promote workplace safety across our supply chain, our 

contracts with third-party suppliers and contractors contain 

explicit clauses that stipulate compliance with our OHS, 

labour and sustainability standards. We routinely evaluate 

our suppliers and contractors for their ability to fulfil these 

contractual requirements. 

PROTECTING OUR PEOPLE [403-2, 403-3, 403-4,  

403-5, 403-6, 403-7]

Comprising management and staff representatives, our 

Health &amp; Safety Committees meet at least once every three 

months to identify potential hazards, recommend solutions 

and implement corrective actions. In addition to providing 

education and training, the committee is responsible for 

addressing safety issues raised by employees. 

The quality of our risk assessments is validated during 

external audits conducted by the Roundtable on Sustainable 

Palm Oil (RSPO) and Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil 

(ISPO). We have also developed OHS manuals, procedures 

and working instructions to minimise the risk of workplace 

injury. To ensure preparedness, health and safety best 

practices are reinforced during morning briefings and are 

further rehearsed during emergency response drills.  

OHS considerations are also incorporated into the 

Collective Labour Agreement with the workers’ union. 

These include provisions for equipping plantation and mill 

workers with personal protective equipment (PPE) and 

the establishment of Health &amp; Safety Committees. We also 

maintain an Emergency Response Team on standby to 

attend to any immediate health and safety-related crisis.

Hazards and Incident Management 

The main hazards encountered in our plantations are 

falling fronds and fruit bunches that dislodge during 

the harvesting process, and sharp fronds that are left on 

the ground to enhance soil fertility. As these hazards are 

associated with relatively minor injuries such as cuts and 

thorn-pricks, our injury severity rate is consistently low. To 

minimise the risk of injury, all harvesters are required to put 

on PPE such as safety helmets, gloves, and boots, which are 

provided by First Resources. At our palm oil mills, safety 

hazards include overhead sling conveyors, slippery floors, 

hot steam, and loud noises. Workers are regularly reminded 

to be vigilant and are briefed on any potential health and 

safety issues during daily shift meetings. 

First aid will be administered to the injured whenever a 

work-related accident occurs. If necessary, the injured party 

will be sent to the nearest clinic or hospital for treatment 

and monitoring. We will then investigate and prepare an 

accident report within 48 hours. Following an evaluation 

of the accident, corrective actions and preventive measures 

will be implemented to prevent recurrences. These actions 

and measures will be socialised with the workers on site.

Promoting Our Workers' Health 

To support the health of our employees and their families, 

we have established medical teams in every operational 

area. Our medical teams conduct routine check-ups 

and deliver various health programmes that aim to 

raise awareness about the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. 

These include healthy living tips, health education, and 

counselling related to chronic diseases.

KEEPING OUR EMPLOYEES SAFE DURING 

COVID-19 

With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we 

implemented measures aligned with the latest applicable 

regulations to protect the health of our employees. 

For example, office employees are allowed to work 

from home and manpower in the offices is calibrated 

in accordance with the latest guidelines. To facilitate 

the transition to work-from-home arrangements, we 

provided our employees with the necessary hardware and 

software for telecommuting. We also supplied face masks, 

face shields and hand sanitisers for employees who 

needed to be on-site and ensured that safe distancing 

measures are observed at all times. 

In the Group’s plantations, mills and processing plants 

in Indonesia, safety protocols and procedures that 

conform with Indonesia’s large scale social restrictions 

(the Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar or PSBB) were 

established. Aside from educating employees on personal 

hygiene and implementing safe distancing measures, 

movements in and out of mills, plantations and refinery 

sites were restricted to prevent the spread of COVID-19. 

All premises are disinfected on a fortnightly basis to 

minimise viral exposure. 

To promote mental wellbeing, we encourage our 

employees to exercise if they are working from home. 

Should our employees report any health issues, we will 

provide support such as referrals to doctors. 

In mid-2020, we launched a new self-assessment 

application for our Corporate and Regional Offices in 

Indonesia. This application will monitor each employee’s 

health condition and facilitate contact tracing should an 

employee be infected with the virus. The assessment is 

conducted on a daily-basis and is used to determine if an 

employee should return to the office. We also established 

a complementary hotline to address queries related to 

our COVID-19 protocols, and facilitated the vaccination 

of all our employees, their families, and the surrounding 

communities. As of December 2021, more than 95% 

of our office employees and more than 70% of our field 

employees have been vaccinated against COVID-19. We 

will continue to ensure that all eligible employees are able 

to be vaccinated. Infected employees are provided with 

medicines and supplements to recuperate.

HEALTH AND SAFETY PERFORMANCE [403-9]

First Resources is committed to eliminating fatalities 

and reducing accidents and injuries in our operations. 

All work-related accidents are recorded and evaluated, 

while recommendations are implemented to prevent the 

recurrence of similar incidents. Our existing whistleblowing 

procedure allows workers to report any work-related 

hazards and hazardous situations. To protect workers from 

reprisals, workers can make an anonymous report through 

a hotline number displayed in the office. The hotline is 

managed by our internal audit team, who will investigate 

any issues reported. Workers are also allowed to stop work 

if they feel unsafe. 

Employee safety is of paramount importance to us. While 

we strive to ensure the safety of our employees, we regret 

to report that there were two fatalities in our operations 

in 2021. The first incident concerned an electrocution, 

whereas the second was attributed to a fall. Both incidents 

were investigated thoroughly, and corrective actions have 

been implemented to prevent recurrences. These preventive 

measures include supplementary training on electrical 

hazards and additional equipment inspections.  

Nevertheless, we have seen an encouraging improvement in 

our safety performance as we recorded fewer fatalities and 

did not sustain any permanent work-related injuries. 

Going forward, we aim to achieve and sustain zero fatalities 

and permanent work-related injuries. 

Note: Rates are calculated based on [number of fatalities/number of hours worked] 

x 1,000,000. The total number of hours worked in 2021 is 43,168,000.

Note: Rates are calculated based on [number of permanent work-related injuries/

number of hours worked] x 1,000,000. The total number of hours worked in  

2021 is 43,168,000. A permanent work-related injury is defined as a work-related 

injury which has a permanent effect on an employee’s ability to work or causes 

permanent disability. Fatalities are excluded from permanent work-related injuries.

Note: Rates are calculated based on [number of recordable work-related injuries/

number of hours worked] x 1,000,000. The total number of hours worked in 2021 

is 43,168,000.

CHAIN [102-9, 103-1]

As part of our commitment towards 

sustainable palm oil, we strive to develop 

a supply chain that is consistent with our 

sustainability policy. To achieve a fully 

FIRST RESOURCES SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN 

FRAMEWORK

SUPPLY CHAIN TRACEABILITY

Encourage accountability of suppliers by developing a traceable 

and transparent supply chain

STAKEHOLDER COLLABORATION

Detect risks in our supply chain by working with stakeholders 

through an established grievance procedure

SUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT

Educate and support suppliers by engaging key suppliers to 

convey our sustainable goals, developments and expectations 

SUPPLIER ASSESSMENT

Influence behaviours of suppliers by including sustainability 

criteria in supplier assessments



traceable and transparent supply chain, we 

actively engage with our suppliers to bring 

them onboard our sustainability journey. 

Fresh fruit bunches (FFB), the feedstock for 

our mills, are supplied by our own nucleus 

estates, third-party estates, thousands 

of individual smallholders (plasma and 

independent), as well as FFB dealers who 

buy from smallholders. Crude palm oil 

(CPO) and palm kernel (PK), which are 

raw materials for our processing plants, are 

either provided by First Resources-owned 

mills or sourced from third-party suppliers 

in Indonesia. 

Developed in 2017, our Sustainable Supply 

Chain Framework helps us to identify 

and manage risks in our supply chain and 

support our FFB, CPO and PK suppliers in 

adopting more sustainable practices. 

We also procure other products and services 

to run our business. Of our non-palm 

procurement, our most significant spend 

for our operations is on fertilisers which 

are sourced locally. Other spend categories 

for our operations include fuel, chemicals 

(methanol, bleaching earth and phosphoric 

acid), spare parts and other materials.

SUPPLY CHAIN TRACEABILITY [103-1, 103-2, 103-3] 

A key commitment in our Policy on Sustainable Palm 

Oil is to ensure that our oil and refined products can be 

traced to their origin. Traceability presents a complex but 

essential first step towards our ultimate goal of enhancing 

transparency and providing our customers with the 

assurance that our products are sustainably sourced. 

Our sustainability team works closely with our commercial 

team to achieve our Group’s traceability targets through 

active supplier engagement. Our full traceability report can 

be accessed on our website. 

Traceability to mills

For CPO and PK to be considered as fully traceable to mills, 

suppliers are required to provide the company name, parent 

100% 

traceability to  

mills since 2017

100% 

traceability to plantations for FFB processed at our 

mills, inclusive of smallholders and third-party suppliers 

S U P P LY  C H A I N



company name, mill name, mill address and geographical 

coordinates. Where information is missing or incomplete, 

CPO and PK volumes from that particular supplier are 

treated as “untraceable”, even if we know the source. 

In 2021, approximately 14% of our CPO feedstock was 

purchased from external suppliers. A list of our CPO and 

PK suppliers, together with their coordinates and address, 

are available on our website. Since 2020, we have also 

included the unique universal IDs for each mill listed in 

our traceability report, which is accessible on our website as 

well. To comply with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm 

Oil (RSPO), these IDs are based on the Universal Mill List 

(UML), ensuring that the listed mills reference a common 

dataset shared across the palm oil industry. In 2021, we 

maintained our record of achieving 100% traceability to all 

our supplying mills, including three new kernel crushing 

plants that have just commenced operations.

Traceability to plantations

Approximately 86% of the FFB processed in our mills 

came from our plantations and plasma schemes, while the 

remaining 14% was sourced from third-party FFB suppliers. 

These include neighbouring plantation companies and 

independent smallholders. FFB is also purchased from local 

dealers who collect FFB from the surrounding area. 

In 2021, we enhanced our supplier selection procedure 

by incorporating a supplier risk assessment as a selection 

criterion. Supplier risk assessment is carried out through 

coordinate verification to determine the validity of the 

supplier's mills/estates location and to check its suitability 

with government regulations. Existing suppliers will also be 

evaluated with this assessment. This procedural enhancement 

will support our goal of achieving 100% traceability to 

plantations for our third-party CPO and PK suppliers. 

While third parties have frequently expressed their concern 

over data sharing, we were generally able to obtain the 

necessary details to achieve our targets by explaining our 

intention and respect for data confidentiality. A particular 

challenge we face is that not all of our suppliers, especially 

those with small or short-term contracts, have committed to 

achieving 100% traceability to plantation. For these suppliers, 

we will step up our engagement efforts to build trust and gain 

more cooperation. 

Going forward, we plan to strengthen our procedure to achieve 

100% traceability to plantations for supplying third-party mills.

SUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT

Once we have traced the origin of our raw materials, we 

are free to focus on our engagements with key suppliers. 

These engagements include one-on-one meetings and group 

sessions to communicate our Policy on Sustainable Palm 

Oil and expectations, as well as help suppliers understand 

the importance of these requirements. 

Through constant dialogue, we hope to foster a relationship 

of mutual trust with our suppliers and smallholders, 

empowering them with the confidence to share their 

challenges in meeting new sustainability standards. 

In 2021, we socialised our sustainability policy and 

traceability requirements to suppliers at two of our mills. We 

also engaged with another FFB supplier to get updates on 

outstanding grievances and discuss traceability requirements. 

SUPPLIER ASSESSMENT [308-1, 308-2, 414-1, 414-2]

Given that most of our raw materials are supplied by our 

own mills and plantations, and that we only purchase small 

volumes of materials from third-parties on an ad-hoc  

basis, our influence over external supplier practices  

may be limited. To minimise the risk of sourcing from  

non-compliant suppliers, we maintain a watch list of high-

risk companies that we update quarterly. 

All our new suppliers are screened using social and 

environmental criteria during our supplier onboarding 

process. This process requires suppliers to submit  

written acknowledgement of their compliance with  

our Policy on Sustainable Palm Oil, in addition to 

any relevant information that fulfil our traceability 

requirements. We will verify the information provided, 

and companies who cannot meet our criteria will not be 

onboarded as a new supplier. 

Our existing suppliers are continuously monitored to 

ensure that their practices are consistent with our Policy on 

Sustainable Palm Oil. We actively monitor the grievances 

raised by external parties in case they involve our third-

party suppliers. Suppliers found to be noncompliant will be 

required to undertake corrective actions within a certain 

timeline. We will suspend sourcing from non-compliant 

suppliers who do not take immediate remedial actions.

STAKEHOLDER COLLABORATION

Ensuring compliance across the supply chain is an 

impossible task to undertake alone.  We leverage external 

parties to help us identify suppliers that we should further 

assess or engage with. External stakeholders such as non-

governmental organisations (NGOs) and customers may 

possess better monitoring tools and intelligence to detect 

errant or noncompliant suppliers. For example, an NGO 

that works to protect the environment sends us monthly 

reports of their deforestation detection. We will undertake 

follow-up actions if any of the highlighted companies are 

identified in our supply chain.

SUPPORTING SMALLHOLDERS [103-1,  

103-2, 103-3]

As managers of approximately 40% of Indonesia’s palm oil 

plantation area, smallholders are key partners in the larger 

movement towards sustainability. Given that First Resources 

cultivates 178,733 hectares of nucleus plantations, we 

are in a unique position to share our experience on best 

agricultural practices with the smallholders we work with 

and facilitate their inclusion into our supply chain. 

We identify communities that are interested in partnering 

with us to develop plantations through the Free, Prior, and 

Informed Consent (FPIC) procedure, which is conducted 

before any new development. We work with these 

indigenous and local communities through various plasma 

scheme partnerships. In some schemes, the Company 

assists smallholders with developing and managing their 

plots until their oil palm trees reach a productive age. 

Following which, the plots are returned to the smallholders 

for management. In other partnership schemes, the Company 

assumes responsibility for developing and managing the 

plantation plots on behalf of these smallholders, even after 

the maturity of their trees. Regardless of the partnership type, 

plasma smallholders can profit by selling their FFB harvests 

to the Company at government-determined prices. By 

providing a consistent and sustainable income for thousands 

of smallholders, these partnerships improve livelihoods and 

contribute to local economic growth. 

We also work with our schemed smallholders to improve 

their yields and develop resilience against price volatility. 

Managed by our field officers, these support programmes 

provide technical assistance, practical training and advice 

on fertiliser and pesticide procurement and usage. We 

also share new farming technologies such as our high 

yielding oil palm seeds, assist with land titling and 

coordinate the transportation of FFB to palm oil mills. 

In 2021, approximately 94% of our plasma smallholders 

were enrolled in our smallholder programmes. As part 

of our wider efforts to support smallholders this year, 

we conducted outreach activities to raise awareness 

of certification systems, including the Roundtable on 

Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). While our smallholders have 

expressed limited interest in such certification schemes, 

we will continue to actively encourage our smallholders to 

implement our sustainability policy. 

As at end 2021, we manage 33,475 hectares of schemed 

smallholders covering 16% of the total plantation area 

S U P P LY  C H A I N



managed by First Resources, and 10% of the FFB we 

processed. In total, we have more than 14,000 plasma 

smallholders supplying to us. 

FFB is also supplied by over 900 independent smallholders 

(including independent smallholders who supply through 

dealers) as of end 2021. Our Policy on Sustainable Palm 

Oil is socialised to our independent smallholders through 

dedicated engagement sessions. During these sessions, 

we ask our new independent smallholders to fill up our 

supplier onboarding form, allowing us to obtain written 

acknowledgment that they have received and understood 

our Policy requirements.

PROTECTING CONSUMER HEALTH 

[102-6, 102-9, 416-2]

Our customers are primarily traders, palm oil refiners, and 

renewable energy producers. We sell our products in both 

local and export markets. For our export sales, we mainly 

sell them on Free on Board basis to our customers who 

then ship the products globally, with the largest markets 

being China, India and Europe. We collaborate with our 

customers to meet their needs and respond to the growing 

market demand for traceable and sustainable palm oil. 

Although First Resources does not produce consumer 

brands, we remain committed to safeguarding consumer 

health. We instituted relevant certification systems to 

ensure that our processing plants achieve and adhere to 

best practices for product quality and safety standards. 

Since 2013, our kernel crushing plant has been certified to 

the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), 

and good manufacturing practices GMP+ B2 standards. 

One of our processing units, PT Adhitya Serayakorita, 

is HACCP certified. In 2021, there were no incidents of 

non-compliance relating to the health and safety of our 

products and services. To ensure that our products meet 

our consumers’ religious dietary requirements, we have also 

obtained the Halal certification and Kosher certification for 

our two palm oil refineries.

SUSTAINABILITY CERTIFICATIONS [102-

12, 102-13, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

Palm oil certifications reassure customers that their 

purchases are sustainably sourced and produced. To meet 

the growing demand for sustainable palm oil, we continue 

to actively participate in various industry schemes and 

work towards obtaining relevant industry certifications. 

These include the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, 

the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil and the International 

Sustainability &amp; Carbon Certification. 

ROUNDTABLE ON SUSTAINABLE PALM OIL (RSPO) 

First Resources has been a member of the RSPO since 2008. 

In 2021, we completed the RSPO-audits for three of our mills 

integrated with plantations, of which one was certified in 

February 2022. However, as onsite audits are mandatory but 

were delayed due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, we were 

unable to meet our 2021 target to certify six mills integrated 

with plantations. Hence, there has been no addition to our 

mills integrated with plantations that are RSPO certified as 

at end 2021.

Given the disruptions posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, 

the RSPO has approved the revision of our initial target 

deadline to achieve 100% RSPO certification from 2024  

to 2026.

In addition, our bulking station, one of our kernel crushing 

plants and one of our refineries are certified against the 

RSPO Supply Chain Certification Standard.

In 2022, we aim to renew our existing certificates and certify 

another four mills integrated with plantations under the RSPO.

INDONESIAN SUSTAINABLE PALM OIL (ISPO) 

In 2021, we targeted to obtain ISPO certification for another 

three mills integrated with plantations.

We managed to complete the Stage 2 ISPO-audit for one 

of our mills which is pending ISPO certificate issuance. 

Another two of our mills have completed their Stage 1 

ISPO-audits. As a result of COVID-19 travel restrictions, 

Stage 2 ISPO-audits that were originally scheduled for late 

2021 were delayed and are being re-scheduled for early 

2022. By 2022, we aim to certify an additional three mills 

under the ISPO. 

INTERNATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY CARBON 

CERTIFICATION (ISCC) 

We successfully renewed all our ISCC certifications in 

2021. As at end 2021, 51,020 hectares of our nucleus 

plantations are certified under the ISCC scheme, which is 

approximately 28% of our total nucleus area. In addition, 

six of First Resources’ 18 palm oil mills, both our processing 

units and one bulking unit are also ISCC certified. We are 

thus able to provide our customers with a fully traceable 

product under the ISCC scheme.

The interests and concerns of our stakeholders guide our 

sustainability approach and communications. Given the 

importance of constructive feedback, we strive to foster 

open dialogue and build trust with our stakeholders. 

We have identified our key stakeholder groups through an 

internal mapping exercise, which considers our impacts 

on them and conversely, their importance to the success 

and continuity of our business. We tailor our method 

of engagement with each of these groups based on both 

parties’ needs and requirements, revising as necessary

G L O S S A RY  O F  T E R M S

Biodiversity 

The diversity (number and variety of species) of plant and animal life within a region.

Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)

The amount of oxygen consumed by bacteria and other microorganisms when decomposing organic matter under aerobic conditions (i.e., when 

oxygen is present) at a specified temperature.

Carbon Dioxide Equivalents (CO2e)

A standard unit for measuring carbon footprints. It expresses the impact of each greenhouse gas in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide needed 

to create the same amount of warming. That way, a carbon footprint consisting of different types of greenhouse gases can be expressed as a single 

number.

Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) 

Another indicator of contamination that shows the amount of dissolved matter in water susceptible to being oxidised. While BOD uses bacteria and 

other microorganisms to test, COD uses chemicals to test. 

Crude Palm Oil (CPO) 

The oil extracted from the pulp of the FFB. 

Effluents

Waste water discharged from a source (such as mill) into a separate body of water.

Extraction rate

The amount of oil recovered from FFB (in percentage) at a mill. CPO is extracted from the flesh of the FFB’s fruitlets; PKO from the kernel of the 

FFB’s fruitlets.

Empty fruit bunch (EFB)

The remains of the FFB after it has been processed and its fruitlets removed at the mill.

Fire Danger Indices (FDI) 

An internal index for fire risk assessment which has four levels: Low, Medium, High and Extreme, depending on humidity, rain and fuel conditions.  

Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB)

The fruit bunch harvested from the oil palm tree. The weight of the fruit bunch ranges between 10 kg to 40 kg depending on the size and age.

Free, Prior and Informed Consent 

(FPIC)

The principle that a community or indigenous people has a right to give or withhold its consent to projects that are proposed, which may affect 

them or their lands they customarily own, occupy or use.

Greenhouse gas (GHG)

A gas that has the property of absorbing and emitting infrared radiation, creating a greenhouse effect. 

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)

A multi-stakeholder standard for sustainability reporting, providing guidance on determining report content and indicators.

High Conservation Value (HCV)

Areas with biological, ecological, social or cultural values of outstanding significance at the national, regional or global level or of critical 

importance at the local level.

High Conservation Value - High 

Carbon Stock Approach (HCV-HCSA) 

assessments 

A participatory process for identifying social and environmental values which need to be conserved in production landscapes. As per the revised 

RSPO Principles and Criteria released in November 2018, any new land clearing (in existing plantations or new plantings) after November 2018 

must be preceded by a HCV-HCSA assessment.

High Carbon Stock (HCS) Approach

A practical methodology for distinguishing forest areas that should be protected from degraded lands that may be developed. It is a sequence of 

processes and assessments undertaken within two overarching modules: a social requirements module, which focuses on respecting communities’ 

rights to their lands; and an integration module, which includes the FPIC and HCV processes.

Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO)

A mandatory certification requirement for all oil palm growers and millers operating in Indonesia imposed by the government in an effort to 

preserve the environment, promote economic and social activities, and enforcement of Indonesian statutory laws in the palm oil sector. 

Integrated Fire Management (IFM)

An in-depth workplan for fire prevention, preparedness, response and recovery.

Interspecific hybrid  

(Elaeis oleifera x Elaeis guineensis) 

The Elaeis oleifera x Elaeis guineensis interspecific hybrid is a cross between the African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) and the American oil palm 

(Elaeis oleifera). Further research is being carried out as the hybrid exhibits characteristics with the potential to improve the competitiveness and 

sustainability of the crop.

International Sustainability and  

Carbon Certificate (ISCC)

A certification system that promotes the sustainable cultivation, processing and utilisation of biomass and bioenergy. It is geared towards GHG 

emissions reduction, sustainable land use, protection of natural biospheres and social sustainability.

International Union for Conservation 

of Nature’s Red List (IUCN Red List)

The world's most comprehensive inventory of the global conservation status of biological species. It is a critical indicator of the health of the world’s 

biodiversity. 

Light Tenera Dry Separator (LTDS)

A machine that separates the outer shell of the palm nut from the palm kernel, allowing the separated fibres and shells to be vacuumed by a blower.  

Mills generally employ 2 LTDS units, where LTDS I and II are involved in the same workflow. The outputs from LTDS I and II are subsequently 

washed with water and chemicals at the clay-bath station.

Nucleus plantation 

Plantations owned by the group.

RSPO New Planting Procedures  

(NPP)

The RSPO NPP consists of a set of assessments and verification activities to be conducted by grower members and certification bodies prior to a 

new oil palm development, in order to help guide responsible planting and ensure that social and environmental requirements have been met. 

PalmGHG Calculator 

A tool developed by the RSPO Greenhouse Gas Working Group 2 to allow palm oil producers to estimate and monitor their net GHG emissions. 

The Calculator also enables palm oil producers to identify crucial areas in their production chain and guide emission reduction opportunities.

Palm oil mill effluent (POME)

The by-product of processed FFB. 

Peat

An accumulation of partially decayed vegetation matter. Peat forms in wetlands or peatlands, variously called bogs, moors, muskegs, pocosins, 

mires and peat swamp forests.
