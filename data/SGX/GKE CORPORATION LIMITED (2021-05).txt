GKE CORPORATION LIMITED | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021

This is the fourth sustainability report 

(“Report”) for GKE Corporation 

Limited 

(“GKE” 

or 

“Company” 

and together with its subsidiaries, 

“Group”) for the financial year ended 

31 May 2021 (“FY2021”). The Board 

of Directors of the Company (“Board”) 

and management of GKE oversee 

the management and monitoring 

of the Economic, Environmental, 

Social and Governance (“EESG”) 

factors of the Company, and take 

them into consideration in the 

determination of the Company’s 

strategic direction and policies. The 

Board has oversight of the EESG 

material factors which are reviewed 

annually and ensures that the factors 

are relevant and current for the 

business. The Board is also involved 

in the management and monitoring 

of these EESG factors through the 

Group’s Sustainability Committee, 

which is chaired by Mr. Neo Cheow 

Hui, GKE’s Chief Executive Officer 

(“CEO”) and Executive Director. The 

Board and management of GKE 

were involved in the preparation and 

review of this Report before it was 

approved and published. 

This 

Report 

describes 

our 

sustainability 

initiatives 

and 

performance for the period from 

1 June 2020 to 31 May 2021 

(“FY2021”) with regards to the 

Group’s 

activities 

in 

Singapore 

and China, including acquisitions 

completed by 31 May 2021 unless 

otherwise stated. This Report has 

been prepared in accordance with 

the GRI Standards: Core Option 

and 

Singapore 

Exchange-ST 

Listing Rules Practice Note 7.6 

Sustainability Reporting Guide. We 

have chosen the GRI Standards 

as a reporting framework as it is a 

well-known and globally-recognised 

sustainability 

reporting 

standard, 

and have also used the United 

Nations Sustainable Development 

Goals (“UN SDG”) to report on our 

sustainability performance.  

The Report covers all subsidiaries for 

which the Group has management 

control, unless otherwise stated. The 

Group’s corporate structure can be 

found on Page 2 of this Report. The 

reporting boundary for our material 

topics may vary, due to differences 

in where the impacts occur most for 

each topic. These boundaries are 

specified in the section “Materiality”. 

We have expanded the reporting 

boundary for this Report to include 

additional entities that have been 

newly acquired or established.

This Report is published annually 

and covers the same period as 

the financial year of the Company

(1 June 2020 to 31 May 2021). 

Our last sustainability report was 

published in October 2020. Where 

possible, we have shared three-year 

historical information on our material 

topics to provide a meaningful 

basis for comparison. To allow for a 

better analysis of our performance 

data with respect to our business, 

we have reported the performance 

of our material topics based on 

business segments as described in 

our corporate structure.

This Report provides us with a 

valuable 

opportunity 

to 

engage 

our stakeholders and respond to 

issues that matter most to them 

and to our business, while at the 

same time, enhances company risk 

management, strategy development 

and 

stakeholder 

engagement 

activities as we work to further 

focus and prioritise our sustainability 

and corporate social responsibility 

initiatives. 

The Report is currently not externally 

assured but we may consider 

external assurance as our Report 

matures over time.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY

APPROACH 

The sustainability focus for GKE is delivering long-

term value for all our stakeholders: customers, 

employees, investors and the communities in which 

we operate. Within this sustainability approach, we 

take the broader EESG aspects, such as labour 

practices, human rights, and societal responsibilities 

into account. This approach guarantees that 

our services and solutions are provided to our 

customers in a manner that is respectful to 

people and the environment and is economically 

smart. This commitment to sustainability involves 

ensuring that strong EESG criteria are integrated 

in our Company’s strategy and business model 

and in its internal policies and processes. We are 

committed to deliver effective solutions and services 

to our customers and create greater value for our 

shareholders through our core values.

Sustainability Committee

GKE’s Sustainability Committee comprises our Head of Committee (CEO and Executive Director), supported by nine 

(9) members representing various business units. Members are selected based on their duties, gender and age so as 

to provide different perspectives on sustainability topics. The Head of Committee reports to the Board and provides 

updates on GKE’s sustainability performance and targets. 

The purpose of the GKE Sustainability Committee is to manage the organisation’s sustainability efforts and develop 

our institutional capacity around sustainability. The Sustainability Committee members assess the current state of 

GKE’s sustainability initiatives, brainstorm possibilities for improvements, coordinate and support GKE’s sustainability 

initiatives and efforts.

MATERIALITY 

GKE’s sustainability reporting framework and material EESG factors were reviewed and updated in FY2021 by 

the Sustainability Committee to ensure the topics are relevant and current. We continued our consultations with 

key representatives from the various business units and reviewed our material topics internally to consider new 

businesses and the relevance of our material topics. Our first external stakeholder survey was conducted in 2018, but 

as the business has now grown to include operations outside of Singapore, we intend to conduct another external 

stakeholder survey in FY2022 and will be reporting on the survey results in our next sustainability report. 

√ denotes subsidiaries and operations in that country which are included in the Report

•	

The Wuzhou Xing Jian’s Ready-Mix Concrete (“RMC”) plant in Wuzhou City, China (“RMC plant”) 

has a fully enclosed structure and runs on electricity. The trucks and traffic areas are frequently 

sprayed with water and the trucks are also washed before they go onto the roads so as to minimise 

dust emissions. This helps to prevent the generation of dust particles which could be hazardous 

for the health of our employees and the neighbouring communities.

•	

GKE recognises the importance of women participation and equal opportunities for leadership in 

the organisation – 14% of our Board comprises of females, and 60% of our key management team 

is represented by females.

•	

GKE prohibits any form of forced labour including child labour, human trafficking and modern 

slavery across all our business units.

•	

97% of our employees are full-time employees. All our employees are paid fair wages in line with 

local regulations.

•	

The RMC plant in Wuzhou City, China, with its fully enclosed structure, allows for a cleaner mixing 

process and prevents air pollution to neighbouring villages and communities.

•	

GKE encourages reducing and recycling in all our operations. In FY2021, 29,420 kg of plastic, 

paper and carton boxes was recycled in Singapore. 

•	

To conserve the use of water at our RMC plant in Wuzhou City, China, the water runoff from 

washing of the trucks is channelled into a water treatment facility which recycles the water for the 

RMC mixing process.

•	

GKE does not tolerate any form of discrimination based on nationality, race, religion or political 

inclination that could compromised equal opportunities in the recruitment process and career 

development.

ECONOMIC ENHANCEMENT

AND COMPLIANCE

Economic Performance (GRI 201-1)

In FY2021, GKE distributed approximately 32.4% of our revenue to key stakeholders – 25.5% to employees, 4.5% to 

government in countries where we operate, namely Singapore and China, and 2.4% to capital providers. The Group’s 

revenue has increased by 11.0% year-on-year from S$107.2 million in FY2020 to S$119.0 million in FY2021. This 

improved performance is due to an increase in productivity at our RMC plant in Wuzhou City, China, as well as higher 

utilisation of warehouse space at better rental rates and streamlining of our businesses to enhance efficiency. More 

details of our economic performance can be found in our Annual Report for FY2021.

ECONOMIC ENHANCEMENT

AND COMPLIANCE

Socioeconomic compliance

(GRI 419-1)

Regulatory compliance is critically 

important to GKE, serving to protect 

our integrity and reputation and 

foster trust among stakeholders. 

Observance 

of 

all 

regulatory 

requirements forms the basis of 

good corporate governance within 

the Group. We also ensure our 

compliance to all relevant local and 

international laws and regulations, 

including 

the 

principles 

and 

guidelines set out in the Code of 

Corporate Governance 2018. More 

details can be found in our Annual 

Report for FY2021.

In FY2021, GKE had zero cases of 

socioeconomic 

non-compliance. 

The safety and well-being of our 

employees 

remains 

our 

utmost 

priority and we continue to ensure 

our safety measures are strictly 

enforced. We strive to maintain 

zero non-compliance cases in the 

financial year ending 31 May 2022.

Our response to COVID-19

Business continuity 

The evolving COVID-19 pandemic 

continues to challenge businesses 

globally. In FY2020, we appointed a 

Business Continuity Manager to steer 

the company’s direction in minimising 

disruptions 

while 

embedding 

sufficient 

safety 

mechanisms 

in our work arrangements. We 

continue to exercise caution and 

remain agile with the changes in 

local public health advisories while 

ensuring our businesses remain 

adaptable and resilient. Flexible 

working arrangements continue to 

be the default, such as work from 

home, staggered working hours 

and split teams. Social distancing 

measures of at least 1 metre remain 

to be strictly enforced. Meetings and 

trainings continue to be conducted 

online whenever possible to minimise 

physical contact. 

The health and safety of our 

employees 

remain 

our 

priority. 

We continue to ensure enhanced 

sanitation of our facilities and all key 

touch points. An adequate supply 

of surgical masks is maintained. 

Safe	 Entry	 check	 in/out	 system	

and temperature screenings for all 

visitors continued to be required for 

all visitors. The Safe Management 

Officer (“SMO”) regularly conducts 

and inspects the safe management 

measures to ensure compliance at 

all times. 

Our customers and vendors

GKE continued to work with our 

customers in various cost saving 

exercises such as passing on 

the rental reliefs, while ensuring 

our 

services 

were 

delivered 

with quality and standard. Our 

vendors and customers continued 

with 

contactless 

payments 

and 

postponed any non-essential on-

site visits to avoid commingling of 

personnel.

Our employees

Our Malaysians employees continue 

to be affected by the border closures 

between Singapore and Malaysia. 

For those who were affected by the 

Movement Control Order (“MCO”), 

GKE has been supporting them 

since 2020 by subsidising their 

accommodation costs in Singapore 

so that they can continue work 

and live in Singapore with minimum 

disruption.

GKE CORPORATION LIMITED | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021

ENVIRONMENTAL

RESPONSIBILITY

We are sensitive to the environmental 

impact 

across 

our 

business 

operations, and are committed to 

taking steps to reduce our impact, 

in particular, the waste generated at 

our operations and GHG emissions 

arising from our activities. Fuel and 

energy consumption is managed 

and monitored by the individual 

business units, and efforts are also 

taken to minimise waste generation 

or to recycle and reuse materials 

where possible.

Our first ready-mix concrete plant 

– Wuzhou Xing Jian Readymix 

Co., Ltd., is a fully enclosed plant 

which also includes fully enclosed 

conveyor belts. The decision to 

use a fully enclosed line was a 

management decision and exceeds 

the requirements set by the local 

regulatory 

authorities. 

The 

key 

reason for GKE to invest in a fully 

enclosed line for the RMC plant was 

to prevent the risk of air pollution 

and 

generation 

of 

particulate 

matter caused by mixing of the 

aggregates and cement which could 



have a long-term health impact 

on the neighbouring villages and 

communities. This will help to avoid 

adverse impacts on the environment, 

human and animal health and 

ecosystems, and at the same time 

create a safer working environment 

for our employees.

The Wuzhou Xing Jian’s Ready-

Mix Concrete (“RMC”) plant in 

Wuzhou City, China (“RMC plant”) 

has a fully enclosed structure and 

runs on electricity. The trucks and 

production 

areas 

are 

frequently 

sprayed with water and the trucks 

are also washed before they go onto 

the roads so as to minimise dust 

emissions. This helps to prevent the 

generation of dust particles which 

could be hazardous for the health of 

our employees and the neighbouring 

communities. We believe in order to 

ensure long-term sustainability of our 

RMC plant, it is important to invest 

in technologies that will allow our 

process to be resilient, green and 

efficient. 

Apart 

from 

ensuring 

that 

our 

business does not result in negative 

impacts on the environment, GKE 

is also committed to reducing our 

environmental footprint through two 

(2) key approaches:

•	

Managing our waste 

responsibly; and

•	

Reducing our GHG emissions.

GKE CORPORATION LIMITED | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021



ENVIRONMENTAL

RESPONSIBILITY

Waste management (GRI 306-1, 306-2, 306-3)

We are conscious of the amount of waste produced in our operations and strive to reduce the amount of waste 

regenerated. Waste such as carton boxes and plastic shrink wrap are sent for recycling while general waste and 

hazardous waste are collected by licensed operators. We have made a conscious effort towards a paperless culture 

throughout our business operations including avoiding the use of paper for meeting agendas and presentation 

materials. 

In FY2021, we have recycled approximately 26 tonnes of paper and plastic shrink wrap and disposed 200 tonnes of 

general waste. We also disposed 3,236 litres and 54 kilograms of hazardous chemicals on behalf of a customer whose 

goods had been damaged during transportation. We worked with a licensed contractor to ensure that the hazardous 

waste was collected and disposed in according with the local regulations. 

At our RMC plant in Wuzhou City, China, our trucks and traffic areas are frequently sprayed with water to minimise 

dust emissions and this water runoff is channelled into a water treatment facility which recycles the water for the RMC 

mixing process. 


11

GKE CORPORATION LIMITED | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021

ENVIRONMENTAL

RESPONSIBILITY

Reducing our GHG emissions (GRI 302-1, 305-1, 305-2, 305-4) 

As one of the leaders in providing warehousing and logistics solutions, we have a dedicated and modern fleet of 

vehicles for our operational needs. We operate our own fleet of vehicles, including prime movers and trailers, and 

have replaced our older trucks with Euro 6 model in our logistics business, which complies with Singapore National 

Environmental Agency regulations. This will help reduce nitrogen oxides pollutants and fine particulate matters.  

Since FY2020, we have moved away from traditional paper-based operations for job order handling in our warehousing 

operations. With digitalisation, the need for printing of hard copy documents is eliminated as job order instructions 

can now be sent directly from the customer service team to operations team. With more efficient storing and sharing 

of information, administrative tasks are reduced, hence increasing productivity of the teams. An Enterprise Resource 

Planning (“ERP”) system has also been implemented in GKE Services Pte Ltd which helps to cut down the printing of 

purchase orders and invoices and there are plans to roll this out to the other entities by 2023. With a connected digital 

network and data stored in the Cloud, it has allowed us to move away from disparate systems, enabling us to better 

streamline our business processes. 

Our overall energy consumption in FY2021 for Singapore and China operations was 73,563 gigajoules, which is 

approximately a 34% increase from FY2020. The increase in energy consumption was largely due to an increase 

in production capacity at the RMC plant in Wuzhou City, China, which also saw an increase of 37% in the energy 

consumed. This can be attributed to fuel used by the trucks as well as electricity used by the RMC plant. For the 

Warehousing and Logistics segment, the energy consumed in FY2021 increased by 30% as compared to FY2020, 

this is partly due to the inclusion of an additional entity, Marquis Services Pte Ltd, in the consolidation of our data 

reporting. 

Our overall Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in FY2021 amounted to 6,317 tonnes CO2e, 

which is an approximately 40% increase compared to FY2020. Our Scope 1 emissions account for 75% of our total 

overall emissions, with more than half of the Scope 1 emissions attributable to the trucks used by our RMC plant in 

Wuzhou City, China.

GKE emitted approximately 0.053 kg of GHG per million Singapore dollars in FY2021. This is our carbon intensity 

based on our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. As we continue to track and monitor our total GHG emissions and 

GHG intensity, we aim to identify opportunities for improvement to make our processes more efficient as well as ways 

to transition to a lower carbon economy.

OUR

CUSTOMERS

As the world becomes increasingly digital, our opportunities continue to expand. But with these opportunities 

come ever-more complex challenges – such as how to keep personal data private and secure, even when it moves 

across borders. We recognise the risks and negative impacts that our business and stakeholders may encounter if 

information	such	as	confidential/sensitive	corporate	data,	personal	data	of	customers,	employees	and	stakeholders,	

is not adequately protected. As we harness technology in our business and operations, the risks have also further 

increased. Data security and privacy is a top priority for us.

Data privacy (GRI 418-1)

Personal data in Singapore is protected under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012. We aim for complete 

transparency in the way we process and manage the data that our clients entrust to us. Employees of GKE are 

required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement for the work that they conduct at GKE. The company’s networks, 

database and websites are also secured to prevent loss of data. CCTV cameras are installed at strategic locations in 

our facilities for physical security, certain offices are also biometric controlled for greater control and access. Training 

and ongoing engagement are the primary ways we build awareness among our employees. 

In FY2021, there were no substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy and losses of customer 

data across the various GKE subsidiaries. We strive to maintain zero cases of breaches of customer privacy or loss 

of customer data in FY2022.

EMPOWERING

EMPLOYEES

Good labour relations (GRI 401-1)

At GKE, we operate on the basis of continuous improvement – constantly looking for ways that we can be more 

efficient, more responsive, less wasteful, more profitable and safer. 

GKE aims to foster an excellence culture. Our employees are passionate, committed, and excel in what they do. 

In return, we recognise their efforts and encourage a culture of collaboration. The talent and motivation of our 903 

employees in FY2021 across our various business units are the foundation for our success. Implementing a strong, 

common culture and purpose across the Group remains the main priority of our management team. As part of our 

restructuring exercise that began in FY2018, we started to integrate similar functions across the different business 

units in FY2019 with the aim of having common corporate functions, such as human resource, sales and marketing. 

By having common corporate functions, we create closer links and drive synergy when implementing new initiatives 

across the various business units. 

In FY2021, we had a turnover rate of 13% and a hiring rate of 17%. Our turnover rate was mostly due to the logistics 

business segment in Singapore where workers had returned to their home countries to be with their families during 

the pandemic, and had not been able to return to work in Singapore when entry restrictions and border closures were 

imposed. The increase in headcount was primarily due to the additional entities – Marquis Services Pte Ltd and Cenxi 

Xing Jian Readymix Co., Ltd, which were included in this Report for FY2021 as well as an increase in headcount for 

the RMC plant in Wuzhou City, China. Our RMC plant hires employees from the surrounding communities near the 

factory. As part of the employees’ benefits in China, the company provides free dormitory accommodation and daily 

meals at the staff canteen for the employees. 

We aim to reduce our overall turnover rate to 12% in FY2022.

Employee health, safety and wellness (GRI 403-1, 

403-2, 403-3, 403-4, 403-5, 403-6, 403-7)

Our people are our most important asset. Neglecting 

their health and safety would not only be irresponsible 

and unethical but would also endanger our business 

performance. GKE strives to work in a healthy and safe 

manner that complies with all applicable occupational 

safety and health laws and standards, and are committed 

to providing our employees with a healthy and safe 

working environment. Our employees are encouraged to 

take ownership when it comes to health and safety. 

Occupational health and safety management systems 

are implemented in GKE’s operations in Singapore and 

China to ensure that all business units have a standard 

practice in place for managing health and safety hazards 

as well as ensuring that workers are provided with a safe 

working environment. GKE Services Pte Ltd, which was 

previously certified for OHSAS 18001, has successfully 

transitioned to be certified for ISO 45001 since 

November 2019. In August 2021, GKE Corporation Ltd, 

together with GKE Private Limited, GKE Warehousing 

and Logistics Pte Ltd as well as GKE Express Logistics 

Pte Ltd, have all attained ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and 

ISO 45001 certification. This is a significant milestone 

for the warehousing and logistics business segment, 

which in the previous year had only achieved bizSAFE 

Level 3 certification. We aim to implement the various 

management systems standards for the other entities 

under our warehousing and logistics segment, with the 

objective of the achieving certification to these standards 

in the future. 

The early implementation of an occupational health and 

safety management at GKE Services Pte Ltd was largely 

due to customers’ requirements, while for the RMC plant 

in Wuzhou City, China, the site is required to comply with 

local health and safety regulations4 and thus a health and 

safety management system was established. 

A systematic approach is used across all our sites 

to identify safety hazards. This is supported by a risk 

management system and the hierarchy of controls5 

applied to reduce the risk associated with the hazards. 

Risk assessments are conducted by risk management 

teams from each business entity and these are submitted 

to	GKE’s	Senior	Manager	–	Quality,	Health,	Safety	and	

Environment (“QHSE”) and Dangerous Goods (“DG”) 

Compliance, who oversees the health and safety 

performance for the Singapore operations. For the 

RMC plant in Wuzhou City, China, the General Manager 

is overall in charge of health and safety at the site and 

works closely with the managers and engineers to 

identify safety hazards. Automation has also been used 

for many of the processes, for example, the loading of 

materials onto conveyor belts, which helps to reduce 

worker exposure to physical hazards such as moving 

machinery parts as well as ergonomic hazards such as 

lifting of heavy loads. 

All our employees are to stop their work if they encounter 

a dangerous or hazardous situation. They are to highlight 

the situation to their Supervisor who will then take the 

necessary precautions to ensure the situation is deemed 

safe again before work is resumed. In the event of a 

work-related incident, a thorough investigation will 

be conducted by the safety representatives from the 

respective business entity and the investigation report 

submitted	 to	 GKE’s	 Senior	 Manager	 –	 QHSE	 and	 DG	

Compliance. A root cause analysis is conducted and 

appropriate corrective actions implemented to prevent 

recurrence.

Our employees attend various internal and external 

health and safety training relevant to their roles. For 

example, managers would be required to attend 

Company Emergency Response Team (“CERT”) or Site 

Incident Controller (“SIC”) training as they are responsible 

for incident response at their respective sites. All new 

employees are required to attend a safety induction 

training which includes a video on the company’s safety 

practices. Refresher safety training for employees is 

conducted in-house by the various Department Managers 

/	Assistant	Managers	/	Supervisors,	while	for	mandatory	

safety training required under the Ministry of Manpower 

Workplace Safety and Health Act, our employees are 

sent to attend the courses through external approved 

training	providers.	GKE’s	Senior	Manager	–	QHSE	and	

DG Compliance, conducts regular in-house training on 

topics such as fire drills, handling of heavy loads and 

dangerous goods management. 

4  Law on Work Safety, Law on Prevention and Control of Occupational Diseases.

5  Hierarchy of controls – elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls and personal protective equipment.

EMPOWERING

EMPLOYEES





At the RMC plant in Wuzhou City, China, a large 

proportion of our employees are employed as drivers 

for our trucks. In FY2021, local authorities were invited 

to speak to our employees on the importance of road 

safety, and safe driving techniques. Standard operating 

procedures (“SOPs”) have also been developed for the 

various activities carried out on site and training provided 

to all employees before they start their work as well 

as on-the-job. In accordance with local regulations in 

Singapore and China, all employees are provided with 

personal protective equipment and undergo statutory 

health checks where required. 

All subcontractors that work at our sites in Singapore and China are required to undergo pre-employment safety 

training and understand the company’s rules and regulations before they are allowed to be deployed at our sites. For 

our Singapore sites, contractors which are qualified to bizSAFE level 3 are preferred, the contractors are also required 

to complete a contractors evaluation form which ensures that they have the necessary procedures and competent 

personnel before they start work. 

Top management is briefed monthly on the overall GKE health and safety performance by GKE’s Senior Manager – 

QHSE	and	DG	Compliance,	as	well	as	by	the	Directors	of	the	various	entities.	Our	health	and	safety	committees	at	

the various sites are represented as follows and report to the CEO.

In FY2021, there were a total of 5 reportable accidents across the whole Group, resulting in 156 lost days. These 

5 cases occurred in our warehousing and logistics business segment – 2 cases resulted in hand injuries, another 3 

cases resulted in back and leg injury. In all the cases, immediate action was taken to review the risk assessments 

and briefings conducted for all employees in the affected areas to ensure that they were aware of the hazards in the 

workplace and to exercise the necessary controls to prevent recurrence of these incidents. There were no work-

related injuries or fatalities attributable to employees or contractors working at our premises in China.

In FY2022, we aim to improve the health and safety awareness of our employees with an objective to reduce the 

number of work-related accidents and lost days.
