CHAPTER 1: ABOUT THIS REPORT 

 

BoardRoom’s Commitment to Doing Good, Doing Well 

 

Boardroom Limited (the “Company”) believes in being a responsible corporate citizen, creating long-

term stakeholder value and protecting future generations by assessing the environment, social and 

governance aspects of our business. With these aspirations in mind, BoardRoom published our first 

Sustainability Report in 2017, communicating to our stakeholders our commitment, performance and 

targets on sustainability. We also conducted our first materiality assessment to ascertain the most 

important sustainability topics to our business and stakeholders, which included issues ranging from 

employee engagement to environmental management. 

 

This year, we continue to report on our approach to managing our material issues, our on-going 

performance, and most importantly, report on the progress we have achieved since last year. 

 

Boundaries &amp; Scope of Our Report 

 

This Report contains information for FY18 for a total of 16 offices, consisting of our headquarters in 

Singapore (one office), as well as offices in Malaysia (seven offices), Hong Kong (one office), Australia 

(three offices) and China (four offices). This year, we have also included information on our operations in 

China. Next year, we will be including our newly-acquired entity in Malaysia, Symphony Corporatehouse 

Sdn Bhd and its subsidiary Sky Corporate Services Sdn Bhd, Symphony Share Registrars Sdn Bhd and 

Malaysian Issuing House Sdn Bhd (“ the Symphony companies”), in the scope of our Sustainability 

Report. 

 

Reporting Framework 

 

This Report was prepared in compliance with Singapore Exchange Limited (“SGX”) reporting guidelines 

and references the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards GRI 101: Foundation, 2016; GRI 102: 

General Disclosures, 2016; and GRI 103: Management Approach, 2016. The GRI Standards set out the 

principles and disclosures that companies can use to report their economic, environmental and social 

performance. We are committed to publishing these reports every year. 

 

Data and External Assurance 

 

BoardRoom applies a standardised approach to data collection and analysis across all our operations, 

which includes ensuring that data is verified internally before reporting externally. We have not sought 

independent external assurance of the data in this Report.

CHAPTER 3: CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE 

 

Over the last few decades, we have worked hard to build our business, adding new country offices and 

new service lines into our portfolio. In 2018, we were proud to announce our acquisition of the 

Symphony companies in Malaysia. This strengthened our position as the leading corporate secretarial, 

share registry and other business services in Malaysia. In our core markets, Singapore, Australia, Hong 

Kong and China, we continue to make inroads and build on our dominant market position. Our hard 

work has paid off, having successfully built a strong brand as a regional go-to provider of innovative and 

reliable corporate and secretarial services. 

Against this backdrop, BoardRoom is poised for our next stage of growth – one that is anchored on two 

megatrends in the business world today. 

First, the digital revolution is fundamentally changing the future of work, faster than ever before. The 

world today has transformed into one where digitalisation has reached every corner of our lives. 

Consumers and clients want constant connectivity. Data and meetings are increasingly being hosted in 

the virtual world. This year, we continue to build our digital strategy, transforming BoardRoom from a 

traditional provider of corporate secretarial services into a cutting-edge service technology (or serv-

tech) company. More than simply adapting to survive in this new digital context, we are strategically 

embedding it into our business as a competitive advantage. We continue to redesign our approaches 

into an operating model which is real-time, agile and information-rich. 

This transformation touches every aspect of our business – we are retraining our staff and rethinking 

how we work. We are leveraging on digital technologies to enhance the services we offer. For example, 

we are one of the companies in the industry to offer a trading engine with our Employee Share Plan 

service, which was rolled out in Australia and Singapore in 2018. In addition, we are now moving 

towards a cloud-based, mobile and border-less workplace where employees from our various offices can 

communicate and collaborate seamlessly. Our goal is to enhance our value proposition, streamline our 

processes and build internal efficiencies, in order to create a seamless customer experience and 

ultimately bring superior returns for our stakeholders. 

The second megatrend which BoardRoom is embracing as a driver of future value, is sustainability, 

which is directly linked to our digital transformation strategy. For us, sustainability is about taking a 

wider and longer-term view of the economic, social, environmental and governance factors that affect 

our ability to create and sustain value for our stakeholders in today’s interconnected world. 

As such, we are aware that while the digital revolution has brought in a wave of opportunities for 

businesses, it has also introduced new threats and fears. The news in 2018 was dominated by a series of 

high-profile incidents on cyber threats and was a reminder to businesses to always remain vigilant. 

Given this climate, we enhanced and strengthened our cybersecurity and data protection capabilities, 

invested resources in building stronger IT teams and conducted more penetration tests and staff 

training on risks such as hacking and ransomware. 

Riding on the wave of digitalisation, we continued steadily on our transition to a paperless workplace, 

creating a virtual office where the printing of meeting minutes and signing of resolutions on paper is 

obsolete. This represents a win-win solution for both planet and profits. 

In addition, this is accompanied by a mindset shift where casual workwear and more flexible work 

arrangements is the norm. We also invested in continuous learning and development, as well as health 

and wellness programmes for our staff with the Wellness Challenge as an example – where 70% of our 

employees in Singapore were rewarded with extra days of annual leave for hitting their fitness targets. 

We will continue to progressively implement such initiatives to prioritise our employees, better serve 

our people and provide them with a more comfortable workplace.

CHAPTER 3: CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE (continued) 

 

Last year, we published our first Sustainability Report in line with SGX requirements. This year, we 

continue to make progress on our efforts to live out our values as a socially-responsible company.  

With that, I am proud to present our 2018 Sustainability Report and the first glimpses of a new 

BoardRoom, a serv-tech company that is anchored on digitalisation and sustainability. We are committed 

to leading the charge in the corporate services industry by looking beyond the short-term, searching far 

into the horizon for unanticipated risks and opportunities that can springboard our business forward. 

On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank you for being part of our journey to chase a greater vision 

for BoardRoom, one that presents a strong value proposition not just for our shareholders, but for all 

stakeholders alike. 

Thank you. 

 

Mr Goh Geok Khim 

Chairman, Boardroom Limited

CHAPTER 4: ABOUT BOARDROOM 

 

Company Overview and History 

 

Listed on the Mainboard of SGX, BoardRoom is Asia-Pacific’s leader in Corporate and Advisory Services. 

We offer Employee Plan Services, Regional Payroll Solutions, Corporate Secretarial, Share Registry 

Services, Accounting, Taxation and Human Resources. Our clientele is made up of over 7,300 public 

listed and privately-owned companies across industries, including Fortune 500 multinational 

companies, publicly-listed and privately-owned enterprises. 

 

This year, we acquired Malaysia-based the Symphony companies, bringing our footprint to a total of 16 

offices in 5 countries in Asia-Pacific, with a workforce of over 610 employees. 

 

A list of our shareholders can be found on page 113 of our AR2018. 

 

Our Financial Position 

 

This year was another year of steady growth for Boardroom, despite a challenging operating 

environment due to geopolitical and trade tensions. We achieved double-digit growth in total revenue, 

with all our business units and geographic markets achieving healthy year-on-year growth – a clear 

demonstration of our resilience, operations excellence and effective strategy. 

 

Group revenue for FY18 came in at a record $91.6 million, a 13.5% increase from $80.7 million in the 

previous year. This is supported by higher business volumes in all the business segments and 

productivity improvement.  

 

Despite the growth, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) 

decreased 7.6% to $14.0 million (FY17: $15.2m), while profit margin dropped to 7.6% compared to 13.1 

% the year before.  

 

Our financial results for the year were weighed down by two factors: a change in accounting treatment 

described below, and a number of additional costs associated with both the Australian and Malaysian 

acquisitions. These include transaction and post-integration expenses, and increased interest expenses 

relating to debt taken out to partially fund the acquisitions.  

 

The adoption of a new accounting standard Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) 

(“SFRS(I)”) 9, resulted in a charge of $2.1 million for unrealised currency loss arising from the revaluation 

of AUD denominated redeemable preference shares (“RPS”) in our Australian subsidiary. These RPS, 

which were previously treated as equity investment, are now being fair-valued as debt investment 

under the new accounting standard.

professionalism and integrity in the Company.  

 

We have based our corporate governance framework on timely disclosures, transparency and 

accountability, so that we can create, maintain and safeguard the value and interests of our 

shareholders. 

 




!

12!

!

CHAPTER 5: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (continued) 

 

Integral to our commitment is the high priority we place on ethical business conduct, in markets where 

we operate.  

 

Professional Ethics of Our Employees 

Employees are expected to comply with our Code of Conduct (found within our Employee Handbook), 

which outlines the standards of behaviour in displaying responsible conduct, honesty and integrity. It 

also provides details on misconduct by employees – such as what actions constitute as misconduct, as 

well as the disciplinary procedures which the company will carry out if misconduct does occurs. The 

Code also highlights grievance procedures for employees, free of reprisals, should they be treated 

unfairly. 

Client-serving employees are also required to conduct themselves according to the highest possible 

ethical standards, bound by BoardRoom’s adoption of the Professional Ethics Statements and Code of 

Conduct issued by the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants and the Chartered Secretaries 

Institute of Singapore where relevant. 

Anti-Corruption and Compliance 

 

To ensure that all employees are sufficiently informed about BoardRoom’s zero tolerance to corruption, 

all employees must undergo a briefing conducted by the legal counsel within the first month of their 

induction with the Company. We also have a strict policy regarding gifts from clients, where employees 

may not receive any gift or advantage from any person or company with a business relationship with 

BoardRoom, without the knowledge and consent of the Director. 

 

No incidences of corruption or non-compliances with regulations (resulting in fines or non-monetary 

sanctions) were reported in FY18. 

 

Our Approach to Handling Complaints 

Our Whistle-Blowing Policy 

 

BoardRoom has in place a whistle-blowing policy open to all relevant internal stakeholders, such as 

directors, employees (full-time, part-time and contract), as well as external stakeholders such as 

vendors, clients and contractors, to raise complaints on any matter which could be a violation of our 

principles. 

 

This includes matters regarding accounting, auditing, internal or accounting controls which are 

questionable or not in accordance with generally-accepted practices prescribed by BoardRoom. It also 

covers serious concerns that could have an impact on the Company, such as unlawful acts, health and 

safety issues, actions that could cause environmental damage, the concealing of unethical actions or any 

other form of improper conduct. Our whistle-blowing policy also refers to any action taken by any 

employee which obstructs another employee to exercise his/her right to make such reports. 

 

This year, we ensured that all employees received a copy of our whistleblowing policy manual, including 

the latest update of the contact details of the Audit Committee (“AC”), and made the document available 

in our intranet (Learning Management System). We will continue to work towards our goal of 

strengthening our whistle-blowing policy. 

 

Complaints can be reported to the AC either in person or by emailing 

whistleblow@boardroomlimited.com.  

 




!

13!

!

CHAPTER 5: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (continued) 

 

Once a complaint is received, the AC will: 

1. conduct its own investigation of the complaint; 

Where necessary, it can also instruct the internal auditor or other third parties to conduct 

further investigations. 

2. inform the reporting party of the likely timeline for a final response; 

3. recommend any remedial or legal action to be taken, where necessary;  

The remedial action can be carried out by instructing relevant management or engaging other 

third parties. If there is reason to believe that a crime has been committed, the AC may also 

report the matter to the authorities. 

4. notify the reporting party on actions which are taken; 

If no action is taken, the AC will also provide a reason for the decision. 

 

The AC will also regularly review and update this policy, with revisions implemented only via approval 

by the Board of Directors. Changes will also be notified to employees. 

 

Our Non-Retaliation Policy 

 

We maintain a strict policy of non-retaliation, ensuring that parties are able to raise concerns through 

the whistle-blowing hotline confidentially and without fear of retaliation in any form. BoardRoom makes 

every effort to protect the identity of the reporting party and will investigate complaints alleging 

retaliatory action, such as disciplinary action against the reporting party. 

 

Our Complaints Handling Policy 

 

BoardRoom also has a separate Complaints Handling Policy targeted mainly at external stakeholders – 

such as vendors, clients and contractors – to lodge complaints against BoardRoom, its directors or 

personnel. The objective of the Policy is to provide guidance on the manner in which we receive and 

handle complaints and to assist us in resolving complaints in an efficient, effective and professional 

manner. 

 

Through both our Whistleblowing Policy and Complaints Handling Policy, we seek to maintain our 

reputation as a company delivering high quality professional services, committed to maintaining our 

responsiveness to the needs and concerns of our clients. 

 

Our Target 

Our Progress in 2018 

We plan to increase and improve channels to 

receive whistleblowing cases by 2019 

Ongoing progress: 

Ensured that all employees received a copy of our 

whistleblowing policy manual and ensuring the 

document is made available in our intranet (Learning 

Management System) 

 

Our Approach to Risk Management 

 

Risk Management Policy 

 

We also have in place a Risk Management Policy to acknowledge the risks involved in our business and 

mitigate it to the best of our ability. The policy aims to ensure that appropriate systems are in place to 

identify material risks facing the Company or to ascertain potential financial impact of identified risks. 

Measures and mitigating strategies are then adopted to manage exposure while responsibilities are 

delegated to handle these risks effectively.  

 

In our Singapore offices, we also have a Compliance Policy Manual, covering issues such as conflicts of 

interest, insider information and confidentiality, gifts and entertainment, client acceptance policy and 

prevention of activities related to money laundering and terrorism financing. 




!

14!

!

CHAPTER 5: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (continued) 

 

Client Acceptance Policy &amp; Anti-Money Laundering Policy 

 

BoardRoom is committed towards the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. 

As such, we have various policies in place to ensure compliance and guarding against any transaction 

which may facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorism. We also conduct regular trainings 

to ensure employees are aware of BoardRoom’s commitments.  

 

Our Procurement Practices 

 

As a service company, we procure goods and services mainly to support our day-to-day operations, 

including office rental, mailing, postage, recruitment and other administrative support services. To 

ensure that the procurement process in the Company is fair, consistent and transparent, our 

procurement policy requires that we obtain at least three quotations from different suppliers before 

final selection either by management staff or the Board of Directors. Most of our service providers are 

sourced locally for cost effectiveness and based on our commitment to support local economies where 

we operate. Environmental, social or governance criteria may also be considered when making 

procurement decisions. 

 

Recognition from the Association of Banks in Singapore (“ABS”) for strong governance 

In recognition of our high standards of integrity and internal controls, BoardRoom was one of the first 

payroll service providers in Singapore to receive an Outsourced Service Provider Audit Report 

(“OSPAR”) certification for payroll services. BoardRoom received the certification after a rigorous 

audit process by Ernst &amp; Young, a testament to the integrity and effectiveness of our internal controls, 

backed by safeguards of the highest standards. The assessment covered issues such as protection of 

client information, strength of data security, as well as the integrity and confidentiality of our 

workflow, service and processes. 

 

Developed by the ABS, OSPAR ensures that outsourced service providers such as BoardRoom have 

the same level of governance, rigour and control as financial institutions.

CHAPTER 6: OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY 

 

As one of the regional leaders in Corporate and Advisory Services, we also strive to demonstrate 

leadership in sustainability. In 2017, we took the first steps in our sustainability journey by publishing 

our very first sustainability report. In the same year, we also conducted a materiality assessment to help 

us focus on our most significant impacts, as well as set up a governance structure to manage our key 

environmental, social and governance issues. From employee engagement to reducing our operational 

footprint, we are on an incremental journey to embed sustainability into various aspects of our business.

Embedding Digitalisation into Our Sustainability Strategy 

 

BoardRoom is going through an exciting period of digitalisation to enable us to secure long-term 

growth and maintain market leadership. At the same time, we have also harnessed the power of 

technology and digitalisation to help us with our sustainability performance. As such, we will be 

reporting on some of the new digital initiatives we have embedded into our sustainability strategy, 

which include: 

 

• 

product innovation: Expanding our digital product offerings for clients to better engage with 

their key stakeholders, such as investors, employees and clients; 

• 

strengthening cybersecurity: Utilising the latest technology to strengthen our defence 

against cyber threats; 

• 

upskilling our employees: Ensuring our employees are well-equipped with 21st century skills 

in areas such as Office Productivity, CRM and Virtualisation; 

• 

a more mobile workplace: Investing in cloud-based systems to create a virtual office, enabling 

our staff to increase productivity while improving work-life balance; 

• 

reducing paper usage: Rolling out of Project Charter across our offices, our initiative to 

implement a digital record and document management system, in order to reduce our paper 

usage. In addition, we also rolled out new innovative products for our clients to reduce their 

paper usage; and  

• 

employee engagement: Launching of our Wellness Challenge, providing employees with 

incentives for meeting their fitness goals, measured using fitness trackers. In addition, we also 

launched FLEA@BoardRoom, a virtual platform for employees to buy and sell pre-loved or new 

items. 



Key: 

‘High’ priority:  Issues with high societal impact and concern to our stakeholders. They form the 

focus of our sustainability efforts and reporting. We will elaborate on our commitments and 

management practices on all of these issues in the chapters that follow. For each of the seven ‘high 

priority’ material issues identified, we have also set timely targets to track the continued 

improvement of our performance on these fronts. 

‘Low’ priority: Issues of relatively lesser importance, but still relevant to both BoardRoom and its 

stakeholders. We will actively manage and report on some of these issues as appropriate.

CHAPTER 7: CLIENTS 

 

As a service-provider, our clients are integral to our overall success. We strive to deliver quality service 

that is unparalleled, providing clients with solutions which are both innovative and practical. As such, 

our core strategy on client management is to forge strong and enduring relationships to help us retain 

our position as one of the top choices for companies in Asia-Pacific seeking corporate and advisory 

services. 

 

Our strategy to provide the best service for clients is based on the following focus areas: 

 

Product Innovation 

To better serve client needs, we continue to invest in product innovation and expand our digital product 

offerings. These new products deliver productivity benefits and help our clients better engage with key 

stakeholders, such as investors, employees and clients, further differentiating BoardRoom from its 

peers as a provider of the latest cutting-edge products for corporate and advisory services. 

• 

Digital platform for Employee Plan Services: In 2018, we launched the latest addition to our 

suite of Employee Plan Services, EmployeeServe. This cutting-edge platform provides clients 

with real-time 24/7 access to their employee holdings, including transactions, balances, 

statements and advices, as well as the ability to instantly update personal information, accept 

employee plan offers, transact on vesting events, sell shares and view companies accounts. 

BoardRoom also provides end-to-end administrative services for clients to develop their own 

bespoke platform, starting from the design to the implementation phase. This new product 

enables clients to maximise participation rates and organisation productivity, while reducing 

company risk. 

This new product builds on our continued success in product innovation since 2016, which include: 

• 

Innovative mobile investor relations platforms: We formed an exclusive alliance with Omni 

Market Tide, a market leader in digital engagement, to provide innovative mobile investor 

relations platforms to listed companies in Singapore and Hong Kong, laying the foundation for 

similar offerings in Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Japan and China. The applications include 

features to enhance the interconnectivity between companies and stakeholders, such as push 

communications, web streaming, shareholder voting, as well as access to company reports 

presentations and share price feeds. 

• 

Innovative application for securities registry market: We also launched an innovative 

application for the securities registry market in Australia. BoardRoom Digital Consolidated 

Application delivers a single online destination that combines smart technology with 

comprehensive real-time analytics, insights, news, statements, transactional and engagement 

features – benefiting clients, investors and employees by helping them to stay connected to the 

markets. 

We will continue to invest in research and development to enhance our product offering, striving to 

redefine how companies access, engage and transact with personal and market financial information. 

 

Client Privacy and Data Protection 

 

To maintain client privacy and data protection, BoardRoom adheres to a strict policy never to disclose 

and provide client information to third parties without prior consent. For example, when client data is 

accessed during audits, we hold a strict policy not to allow the copying of any confidential documents. At 

least one finance coordinator must also be present to ensure no misappropriation of information takes 

place during the process.

CHAPTER 7: CLIENTS (continued) 

 

Enhancing Data Protection 

 

To further reduce our privacy-related risks, we engaged a third-party consultancy, Straits Interactive 

(“SI”), for the second time after our first engagement in 2016. Together with SI, we conducted the 

following activities in 2018: 

• 

developed BoardRoom’s governance framework, policies and processes to address compliance 

gaps with the Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”); 

• 

reviewed relevant documents and third-party contracts/agreements for compliance with PDPA 

requirements; 

• 

identified BoardRoom’s privacy-related risks resulting from our operational processes and data 

flows which deal with personal data, and to implement appropriate controls and measures to 

further mitigate privacy-related risks. 

 

Staff Training: 

We recognise the importance of continually equipping our staff with the necessary knowledge and 

skills to function as in-house data protection officers. As such, SI also conducted three training 

sessions with hands-on practice on the Straits’ Data Protection Management System (DPMS). The 

training session provided staff with a step-by-step approach to: 

J 

assess their personal data information assets; 

J 

conduct self-assessment for PDPA readiness; 

J 

perform an information security assessment and onsite audit; 

J 

monitor gaps and manage actions through an ongoing compliance dashboard; and 

J 

manage data breaches through an integrated response management system.!

 

Strengthening Cybersecurity 

 

In this age of increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks, we also recognise the need to invest in 

strengthening our defence against cyber threats. Some of our programmes and initiatives include: 

• 

Conducting annual penetration tests to assess our security policy, the level of security 

awareness by employees and our ability to identify and respond to security incidents; 

• 

Implementing firewalls and anti-virus softwares (e.g. Endpoint) to tackle the threat of 

ransomware; 

• 

Upgrading of our Guest WiFi; 

• 

Implementing encryption technology for stored data; and 

• 

Improving security handling in compliance with OSPAR. 

 

Staff Training: 

To ensure that our staff are also well-trained on cyber threats which they could potentially encounter 

in their line of work, we also conduct annual staff training and share emails whenever there are new or 

potential cases of phishing or IT-related security threats. 

 

To date, BoardRoom has not received any substantiated complaints on data breaches, cases of known 

breaches of customer privacy or any identified losses of customer data. 

 

“Compliance of the PDPA is an on-going process and Boardroom, with Straits’ knowledge, is continuously 

looking at ways to improve its policies and processes to address any PDPA compliance gaps as well as the 

controls and measures to mitigate its top privacy-related risks.” – Straits Interactive on BoardRoom’s 

approach to data privacy 

 

Our Target 

Our Progress in 2018 

We are committed to maintaining zero cases of 

customer data privacy breaches 

Achieved

CHAPTER 7: CLIENTS (continued) 

 

Client Satisfaction 

 

BoardRoom has in place robust systems to track client satisfaction and will continue to develop our 

capabilities in this area. In all of our offices, BoardRoom’s team of client managers engage with clients on 

a frequent basis to maintain high client satisfaction. Many of our clients continue to renew their 

contracts with us and engage our services year after year. 

 

To more accurately measure client satisfaction, BoardRoom Australia has been using the Net Promoter 

Score (“NPS”), a management tool which measures the loyalty of customer relationships, adopted by 

more than two-thirds of Fortune 1000 companies. Using NPS, we were able to identify clients which 

gave BoardRoom a lower score and work on managing these relationships in a more proactive manner. 

Last year, client retention performance for Australia was at the highest ever, at 97%. 

 

Drawing from the success of NPS in our Australia office, we are currently assessing the possibility of 

rolling out the system for additional offices and will continue to report on our progress. In addition, we 

are also looking at how staff can be trained to better service clients by better understanding their 

expectations and business requirements. 

!

Our Target 

Our Progress in 2018 

We plan to accurately track and increase the 

number of retained clients by 2019 

Ongoing progress: 

Considering rolling out NPS across different 

offices, following success in Australia

CHAPTER 8: EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT 

 

At BoardRoom, we recognise that every member of the team brings a unique set of talents and skills to 

our business. We strive hard to be an employer of choice, committed to ensuring that every employee 

feels engaged, motivated and proud to be part of our team. To that end, we work hard to create a diverse 

and inclusive environment for our employees to enjoy personal and professional growth alongside the 

Company. 

 

*We will be including our newly-acquired entity in Malaysia, the Symphony companies, in the scope of 

our Sustainability Report next year.

Our Target 

Our Progress in 2018 

We would like to continue to ensure equal 

opportunities regardless of race or gender 

New target set 

 

Change in target: In 2017, we reported on our target to increase the number of females in leadership. 

However, after a reassessment of our performance, we have decided to change our target to support a 

wider group of employees, regardless of race and gender.

Employee Remuneration and Benefits 

 

To reward our employees for their service and contribution to the Company, BoardRoom is committed 

to providing the best we can for them, both in terms of remuneration or additional benefits. On top of 

adhering strictly to the basic terms and conditions of employment stipulated by national laws in our 

countries of operation (e.g. the Employment Act of Singapore), we also aim to provide remuneration 

above the minimum standards set by the government, benchmarking salaries to industry standards and 

expectations. 

 

In 2018, we provided additional dental benefits to our employees. Our comprehensive package now 

includes insurance – covering medical, specialist, health and safety, outpatient, hospitalisation, personal 

accident, critical illness, dental, executive health screening and term life – as well as leave for sickness, 

bereavement, marriage, maternity, paternity, childcare, unpaid infant care, study and exams.

Performance Management 

 

To ensure that our employees receive timely feedback on their performance and support to chart out 

their professional growth, we have put in place a comprehensive employee appraisal and performance 

management system. 

 

This year, we implemented a new appraisal system in all our offices apart from Australia. The new 

system defines positive behavioural characteristics for the manager based on our values of having and 

being: 

• 

open: Communicating in a manner that is open and transparent; 

• 

collaborative: Working closely with partners to develop solutions that are smart, customer-

centric and easy to use; 

• 

driven: Measuring performance by our success; 

• 

performance: Having a team of diverse and experienced professionals to ensure our solutions are 

current and compliant to ISO standards; 

• 

passion: Genuinely believing that what we do makes a difference; 

• 

long-lasting: Nurturing relationships and helping to grow our business for the long term; 

• 

pro-active: Taking initiative to make things happen and respond to market demands in a timely 

manner; and 

• 

partners: Having diverse networks and partnerships to help us work effectively and efficiently 

across various industries. 

 

The work of all employees is appraised on a continuous basis through formal appraisal reports prepared 

annually. Through these appraisals, we track the performance, progress, future potential and 

development needs of our employees and help them to improve their performance. 

 

Training and Development 

 

Recognising the importance of continuous learning, we have invested resources to provide employees 

with a series of courses and workshops to aid in their professional and personal growth. This includes 

external courses, in-house courses and on-the-job training.

CHAPTER 8: EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT (continued) 

 

Highlights of our new soft skills training courses include: 

• 

digital skills in areas such as Office Productivity, CRM and Virtualisation; 

• 

train the trainer programmes on effective presentations, upskilling them in areas such as 

facilitation; verbal and nonverbal presentation delivery techniques – content which our more 

senior employees can in turn incorporate into their presentation programmes for their team; 

and 

• 

psychometric profiling for managers to help them match profiles for their team.  

 

The turnout and feedback for these training programmes have been positive, leading to improvements 

in our internal operations and how we respond to client needs. We will continue to invest in upskilling 

our employees in the coming year.

enabling them to work from home based on their job functions. Accompanied with our investment in 

cloud-based systems and virtual office, we are committed to maximising the use of digitalisation to 

increase productivity while improving work-life balance. We are in the midst of reviewing our flexible

Wellness Challenge &amp; Company Wellness Leave 

 

To encourage our employees to keep fit and maintain a healthy lifestyle, we launched the Steps 

Challenge providing employees in Singapore with incentives for achieving measurable fitness targets. 

This is in line with the Singapore government’s inter-company National Steps Challenge targeting to 

have 250,000 Singaporeans take part nationwide. 

 

70% of our employees took part, where they were rewarded with five days of Company Wellness Leave 

for either achieving at least 2% reduction in body fat or hitting around 10,000 steps per day for a period 

of three months as recorded by fitness trackers. Employees could either take part individually or as a 

team. Our Human Resources team invested a significant amount of resources for the administration of 

this programme – our key programme for employee engagement this year. 

 

“I enjoyed taking part in the Wellness Challenge as it challenged me to walk longer distances to clock 

the additional steps and lose a little weight.”- Doris Lim (Admin Assistant, Central Admin Department) 

 

Fun@BoardRoom Activities (Singapore) 

 

To build stronger friendships and create a sense of community, we conduct monthly welfare events such 

as initiatives to welcome new employees, fitness classes and celebrations during festive seasons.

We will continue to monitor our Turnover Rate and implement strategies to retain top talent for our 

team. 

 

Note: This year, we closed our office in Suzhou, China, leading to the departure of 24 employees. In line with our HR policy 

and national regulations, we made sure our employees were notified 30 days in advance and received a severance package 

with varying levels of compensation depending on the number of years with the company. In order to more accurately 

calculate averages for our Employee Retention Rate and New Employee Hires and Turnover by Gender, we excluded data 

from China due to the closure of our office in Suzhou.

CHAPTER 9: ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT 

 

As a professional services company, BoardRoom recognises that the greatest opportunities to lower our 

environmental footprint lie within the locations where our employees operate. As such, our 

environmental strategy is focused on ensuring we are as resource efficient as possible. 

 

This year, we focused our efforts on using technology to reduce our paper usage and need for travel, as 

part of our ongoing quest to reduce our operational footprint and environmental impact. 

 

Reducing Paper Usage 

 

Recognising that as an office-based company, the most significant material we use 

is paper for printing of documents. Thus, we have focused the majority of our 

efforts to reduce our paper use. We currently use environmentally-friendly paper 

certified by the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (“PEFC”). 

 

Project Charter: Transition to Paperless, Cloud-Based Systems 

Following on from our first paperless initiative launched in 2017, we have continued to roll out Project 

Charter, BoardRoom’s initiative to implement a digital record and document management system. 

 

Progress achieved in 2018: 

• 

Set up a Paperless Committee to manage the project 

and ensure the timely delivery of its various stages, 

including planning, process change and user 

acceptance tests; 

• 

Launched the initiative in Singapore; and 

• 

Engaged a local provider to standardise and 

streamline our electronic management methodology 

for all offices in Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong. 

 

To further reduce the need for printing, we have invested in a 

number of additional systems to meet our target of setting up 

a cloud-based ‘virtual library’ for internal processes: 

• 

Electronic signing of documents (DocuSign); 

• 

Document management system providing employees 

with digital access to documents (“KRIS”); 

• 

Cloud systems for data storage (Office 365 initiative); 

• 

Enhanced customer relationship management systems (Salesforce Lightning); and 

• 

Online accounting (Xero for Accounting).

Total Time Cost Savings (Estimated) 

 

For offices which have started rolling out Project 

Charter, we have estimated the total cost savings 

based on staff hours saved on filing and printing, as 

well as the cost saved on purchasing reams of paper. 

Across our offices, we saw estimated time cost 

savings of between 1 to 5%.!

Our Progress in 2018 

We plan to reduce paper usage by 20% by 2019 

Surpassed target: 

75.5% reduction in paper usage (62% reduction 

for A4 paper, 89% reduction for A3 paper) 

 

Product Innovation to Reduce Paper Usage by Clients 

 

We have also been developing innovative new products to help our clients reduce their paper usage. We 

will continue to look for similar opportunities through product innovation. 

 

New application providing real-time digital information 

In 2016, our Australian office launched a new application allowing clients to view real-time information 

on markets and their investments digitally, reducing print and mail overheads. The application acts as a 

central hub providing digital information such as: 

• 

real-time push notifications including movements within the register, securities expiration; 

• 

directors interest reporting and other critical events and activities; 

• 

requests for beneficial ownership analysis; 

• 

comprehensive news section including legal and regulatory announcements; and 

• 

real-time access to equities holding, transaction statements.

CHAPTER 9: ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT (continued) 

 

Reducing Need for Travel 

 

Transition to Virtual Meeting Platforms 

 

To reduce the need for travel, we have also implemented systems for our employees to communicate 

virtually, such as Zoom and the 3CX phone system. These virtual meeting platforms have since been 

frequently utilised to conduct meetings, whether weekly, fortnightly or monthly. 

 

Reducing Energy Consumption and Efficiency 

 

A significant challenge faced by BoardRoom is that we do not own the buildings in which we operate. 

This limits our ability to control certain operational aspects such as the thermostat for the air-

conditioning units, the type of light bulbs used and the amount of discharge by taps in toilets used. 

 

Nonetheless, we continue to seek opportunities to improve operational efficiency.

FLEA@BoardRoom 

 

In line with our commitment to raise awareness about 

sustainability among our employees, we also started a new 

initiative where colleagues can buy and sell pre-loved or new items 

through a virtual platform. Employees used the platform to post 

items such as earrings, dresses, kitchen appliances and skincare 

products. 

 

The platform, hosted on Chatter, was also used to share posts on 

environmental conservation. A total of 33 postings were made on 

topics such as reducing one’s environmental footprint on World 

Environment Day and plastic pollution on World Oceans Day.

CHAPTER 10: COMMUNITY INVESTMENT 

 

At BoardRoom, we continue with our commitment towards community investment, putting resources – 

both financial and manpower – towards causes we believe in. This year, we conducted a total of 15 

events, both to raise funds and to give our employees a chance to volunteer to support a variety of 

underprivileged groups, including children in need and the elderly. This year, we also raised more than 

SGD23,000 for a variety of causes.
