SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021




CREATIVE SXFI CARRIER heralds a new dimension in Dolby Atmos® soundbar technology with built-in  

Super X-Fi® Headphone Holography to create a new multi-speaker cinema experience on headphones. The 

SXFI CARRIER carries on the engineering marvel of the award-winning Sonic Carrier which has been dubbed by 

industry experts as the “soundbar of the gods”. 

Jointly developed by Creative and Dolby Laboratories, SXFI CARRIER has the same sound signature as the 15.2 

Sonic Carrier at less than half the size and at a fraction of the price. Even with a scaled down size,  SXFI CARRIER 

can transform your living room to provide a full-fledged cinema experience. 

When there’s a need to enjoy your movies privately at night without disturbing your family or neighbors, put on 

SXFI THEATER headphones (optional) to enjoy the same cinematic experience as you would on the soundbar.

CREATIVE TECHNOLOGY LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

For the financial year ended 30 June 2021

Management of procurement practices is vital for our business.  As a finished goods manufacturer, we recognize the complexity 

of our supply chain and have set expectations for our suppliers to operate in a socially and environmentally responsible manner 

by maintaining management systems that integrate environmental, health and safety, labour and ethics standards into their business 

processes.  We expect suppliers to conduct their worldwide operations in a responsible manner that does not result in human 

rights violations. 

ENVIRONMENT

Our vision is to reduce and minimize adverse impact on the environment through a commitment for continuous improvement.  We 

conduct our business operations responsibly and efficiently, constantly seek to minimize our environmental footprint and make 

efficient use of limited resources.

As a global leader for product innovation in audio and personal digital entertainment segments, Creative offers consumers a 

complete, high quality digital entertainment experience through Creative’s hardware, software applications and services. Finding 

a perfect balance between form and function, Creative strives to create value to our customers for every product purchased.

Excellence in design and engineering is at the heart of what we do.  Our goal is to bring products which consumers love, using 

groundbreaking technology and leading-edge designs for not just the technically-savvy consumers, but for everyone who enjoys 

entertainment. With strong focus on user-friendly interface, multiple features and cool industrial designs, the Creative brand is 

synonymous with lifestyle personal digital entertainment.

To achieve this, we believe in investment in research and development, spending $14.5 million in FY2021 on research and 

development on product development, industrial design and innovation in technology, with emphasis on developing responsible 

products.

Improving the energy efficiency of our products is a driving factor in our product development.  This allows us to reduce the 

carbon footprint of our products.  We have put in great effort to improve battery life and product energy efficiency during our 

product innovation process.  This is done without sacrificing product performance or consumer experience.  Our products consume 

less than 0.5 watts of power in standby or off mode and less than 2 watts in networked standby, in compliance with EU energy 

efficiency requirements.  All our products operating on rechargeable batteries also meet the U.S. Department of Energy requirement 

in terms of Unit Energy Consumption.  All our products with power adaptors comply with the Europe Energy-Related Products 

(ERP) Directive and the U.S. Department of Energy Level VI energy efficiency requirements, which requires power adaptors to 

have more than 88% average efficiency, and the adaptors draw less than 0.1 watts of power for products with output power less 

than 49 watts, and draw less than 0.21 watts of power for products with output power more than 49 watts, when the product is 

turned off or unconnected. 

Packaging is an important aspect of our product design.  It helps to deliver products to market safely, provides information to 

consumer, and is also a branding and marketing tool.  We continue to work on improving our packaging to be more environmentally 

friendly, taking into consideration the amount and type of packaging materials used in our products, like using less plastic and 

more paper for our packaging materials.  

Our use of hazardous substances is limited to those substances which are necessary due to unavailable substitutes that is scientifically 

or technically practicable.  Our products do not contain restricted substances exceeding the allowable threshold limits. Restricted 

substances are hazardous to the environment and pollute landfills, and are dangerous in terms of occupational exposure during 

manufacturing and recycling.  We are compliant with Restriction of Hazardous Substance (RoHS) Registration, Evaluation, 

Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACh).  

Our products are not only designed to be energy efficient and with limited use of restricted substances.  They are also designed to 

have less impact on the environment at the end of their life cycle.  We are registered with various compliance schemes in Europe 

for collection and recycling of WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment), batteries and packaging.  The Company pays 

for the future recycling when putting products in circulation.

CREATIVE TECHNOLOGY LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

For the financial year ended 30 June 2021

ENVIRONMENT (cont’d)

The Company ensures raw materials and packaging materials used are sourced from responsible and reliable suppliers. Our suppliers 

are mostly certified to ISO14001 – Environmental Management System.  They have also given commitment on their social and 

environmental responsibility, with compliance to the RBA (Responsible Business Alliance) Code of Conduct which establishes 

standards to ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry supply chain are safe, that workers are treated with respect 

and dignity, and that business operations are environmentally responsible and conducted ethically.

In our assessment, product distribution and logistics is another important environmental factor.  We are working to optimize 

our approach to product distribution and logistics, focusing on logistical efficiency and reliability, cost efficiency, environmental 

footprint.  With proper planning and scheduling, where possible, our products were transported to the market by sea freight, and 

cargoes are consolidated in the most efficient manner.  Use of regional hubs has also helped in reducing the carbon footprint.

Creative strives to avoid unnecessary impact on the environment and to reduce environmental impact.  We practice green initiatives 

in the workplace by reducing energy consumption, implementing energy-efficient measures and increasing paper recycling to 

reduce resource depletion.  

One of the measures adopted is to reduce paper usage.  Electronic documents are used whenever possible, without having to print 

hard copy.  Invoices and statements of accounts to customers are sent through emails.  Electronic approvals were implemented 

where possible, for various systems, like human resource systems and purchase requisition systems.

In our commitment to improve environmental footprint, we believe working towards energy efficiency will provide a positive 

influence on our environment and also help to reduce our energy costs in the long term.   We tracked our electricity consumption 

at our Corporate Headquarter in Singapore, as Singapore Corporate Headquarter is where all major activities take place with 

majority of the Group’s headcounts and floor spaces are located.  All electricity in Singapore is purchased from the national 

grid and is produced  almost entirely by the combustion of natural gas.  A total of 358,131 kWh of electricity was consumed in 

FY2021.  Energy intensity per gross floor area in FY2021 was 61 kWh per square metre.

Creative continues to review and implement energy conservation and efficiency initiatives, and target to reduce electricity 

consumption.  We will explore and consider various initiatives such as efficient use of spaces, use of energy efficient appliances, 

motion sensors for lights.

There is no incident of non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the reporting year.

The Group also encourages employees to reduce business travel.  Creative has offices in Asia, Europe and America.  Interoffice 

communications are made through conference calls or electronic mails whenever possible. A fully integrated, seamless ERP system 

also helps in sharing of data for operations.

SOCIAL

Creative is operating in a highly competitive industry, we believe our people are the building block of the Company, where the 

ability to attract, develop and retain the right and best people, is paramount to the success of the Company.

We encourage a work environment that embraces inclusiveness, diversity and teamwork, with employees from various countries, 

ethnicities and age groups.  We value diversity of our people which in turn helps foster innovation and enable us to better 

understand our customers.

Creative is an equal opportunity employer.  Prospective employees are evaluated based on their qualifications, capabilities 

and experience, regardless of gender, age or ethnicity.  Employee evaluations are conducted through a transparent appraisal 

process.  Creative offers employees competitive remuneration packages commensurate with their experience, performance and 

job responsibilities.

CREATIVE TECHNOLOGY LTD. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

For the financial year ended 30 June 2021

To compete in an ever-changing industry, we believe in investing in employee training and development.  Creative provides the 

necessary resources and support for employees who are keen to learn and develop their functional, technical, and professional skills.  

This will broaden and deepen employees’ professional knowledge and skills, and also help employees to reach their fullest potential. 

At Creative, we place emphasis within our organization to promote workplace safety and healthy work environment for our staff 

and visitors.  A safe and healthy work environment enhances employee retention and morale.

As at 30 June 2021, Creative has a total staff strength of 415 from Asia, Europe and United States of America.  Of this total staff 

strength, 85% are from Singapore, all of which are permanent staff and 60% are male and 40% female.  

On the product front, Creative always invests its resources on our product labels.  From design to production, it went through 

numerous levels of reviews to ensure the right messages are conveyed to the consumers.  From encouraging potential customers 

to purchase our products to communicating how to use, recycle or disposal of the package or product.

Labelling is not just a key marketing tools, it is also an effective means of information transmission.  Being an innovator, 

manufacturer and distributor of consumer electronic products, Creative recognizes product information and labelling can have 

great environmental and social impacts to our customers and end users. 

Through clear labelling on our products, consumers are aware of how to recycle or dispose of our products.  Marking of the 

mandatory environmental logos such as the WEEE marking and the China RoHS marking, are placed on our product packaging.  

We also provide unique QR codes which consumers can have access on the product’s safety and regulatory information online.

With a dedicated team in the Corporate Headquarter, Creative has established internal procedures to ensure compliance with 

regulations on environmental laws and directives of every country it supplies to.  The team monitors these regulations and 

introduces new measures to respond proactively to evolving environmental laws and directives. 

The Company has not identified any incidents of non-compliance with regulations concerning product information and labelling 

and marketing communications.

GOVERNANCE

Creative strongly believes that good corporate governance processes are essential for corporate sustainability.  We are committed 

to adhere to a high standard of corporate governance, accountability and transparency to safeguard the interests of all stakeholders.

The Board and Management are committed in conducting business with integrity, consistent with the high standards of business 

ethics, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements.

The Board monitors the effectiveness of management and reviews the Group’s corporate governance practices.  The Board adheres 

to the principles and provisions of the Singapore’s Code of Corporate Governance 2018.  We have also adopted a Code of Business 

Conduct and Ethics which sets out the principles and policies upon which our businesses are to be conducted, and implemented 

a Whistle Blowing Policy which provides a mechanism for employees to raise concerns about possible improprieties in financial 

reporting or other improper business conduct, whilst protecting the whistleblowers from reprisal within the limits of the law.  

For detailed discussion on the Group’s corporate governance practices, please refer to the “Corporate Governance” section of the
