SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT 

 

Integrating a sustainable supply chain into our operations involves engaging responsible partners and 

this continues to be one of our targeted area of improvement. Through streamlining and improving 

our supply chain, we reduced our suppliers from 170 to an estimated 130 core suppliers from the 

previous year to provide us with key clinical materials such as medical supplies, medical equipment 

such as medical blood pressure monitor machine and consumables such as medical gloves, etc.  

We periodically evaluate our suppliers to ensure that their performance align with internal criteria 

established. Evaluation criteria include service excellence, consistency and timeliness of delivery. 

While we continue to ensure that all suppliers and vendors are registered with relevant local 

regulatory body for the sales of health products, we are also pleased to share that some of our 

suppliers are recognised with certifications and accreditation such as Good Distribution Practices 

Certifications issued by the Health Sciences Authority as well as College of American Pathologists (CAP) 

accreditation obtained by one of our supplier providing laboratory services. 

COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT 

During the FY 2018, there were no community involvement initiatives conducted by the Group. 

Nevertheless, plans for community involvement in 2019 have already begun, health talks to grassroots 

and visits to hospital to offer free health screening services are some of the initiatives where the 

planning processes are underway. 

MEMBERSHIP OF ASSOCIATIONS AND CERTIFICATES  

 

 

Apart from our clinics being CHAS and Medisave accredited, to provide for more extensive services 

and greater convenience to our patients, we consistently strive to obtain more accreditations that are 

beneficial. Some of our clinics has Yellow Fever Vaccination accreditation which allows our patients to 

be able to access compulsory vaccinations should they decide to travel to countries which require 

yellow fever vaccination. Additionally, we have also obtained MBS@GOV accreditation to utilise the 

billing system to submit the medical bills of civil servants, pensioners and their dependants to the 

government for our patients to enjoy the convenience of not having to submit claims manually. Lastly, 

some of our clinics also obtained Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC), an accreditation which 

proves our ability to serve the primary healthcare of Singaporeans in times of national need and 

displaying the ability to provide response to public health emergencies. 

 





48 Clinics with both Medisave and CHAS accreditations and 1 Clinic with Medisave Accreditation

GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND SUSTAINABILITY 

 

We maintain committed to good corporate governance and have ensured that policies and procedures 

are in place to safeguard against fraud and protect the interests of our stakeholders.  

As the Board Composition remains unchanged as at 31 December 2018, the Board continues to 

maintain an effective role in setting goals, reviewing and advising on overall strategies and directions. 

The board continues to oversee the effectiveness of the management and assumes responsibilities for 

overall corporate governance of our Group to ensure our Group’s strategies are in the best interests 

of the Company and its stakeholders. Details of our Board members and respective committees during 

FY2018 are as follows:

GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND SUSTAINABILITY (CONT’D) 

 

Our Group has continued to fine tune our policies and practices to safeguard the interests of our 

stakeholders and some of these policies are discussed in detail below. 

 

WHISTLE-BLOWING POLICY 

 

Our Group continues to adhere to the policies and procedures established on whistle-blowing. 

Through the Annual Report, we continue to provide information about our whistle-blowing channel. 

To allow an independent investigation and appropriate follow-up on any concerns or possible 

improper financial reporting raised, the reporting channel is directly addressed to the Mr Chen Yeow 

Sin, the Audit and Risk Committee (“ARC”) Chairman. As such, reports of suspected fraud, corruption, 

dishonest practices or other similar matters can be lodged via email to Mr Chen Yeow Sin, the ARC 

Chairman at whistleblow@healthwaymedical.com. 

INTERESTED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 

 

We continue to utilise the Interested Person Policy, which governs the procedures for identification, 

review and approval of transactions with interested persons. All Interested Person Transactions (“IPT”) 

are reviewed periodically to ensure the transactions are carried out on an arm’s length basis and on 

normal commercial terms and all reportable transactions are announced on SGX website and through 

the annual report accordingly. 

SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH 

 

Our Group entered the next phase of transformation and announced our new Company’s vision and 

tagline of “Empowering Healthier Lives”, placing our patients at the core of all we do. We also 

assimilated sustainability practices to reduce our carbon footprints in the midst of the transformation 

while we aim to supply better quality of healthcare and accessibility to our patients with 

improvements to operation efficacy and refurbishment to our clinics. One of the initiative is to utilise 

air-conditioners which are classified as five ticks under the Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme (MELS), 

representing the most energy efficient band of air-conditioners.  

Complementing the utilisation of energy efficient air-conditioner, we are also using LED light bulbs 

which are more energy efficient than traditional lightings. These measures would allow us to enjoy 

costs savings due to reduced electricity costs as well as become a more environmentally friendly 

organisation.

Corruption 








12 

 



ANTI-CORRUPTION  

 

Anti-corruption remains a key component of our Group and we continue to maintain a culture of 

keeping out corruption and dishonest behaviour. To assist in creating an anti-corruption culture, anti-

corruption policies such as our conflict of interest declaration policy and corporate gifts policy are 

made accessible and communicated to all our staff to educate and inform our staff on the importance 

and necessity of declaration of interests as well as the dos and don’ts on corporate gifts. The summary 

of accessibility of the policies are indicated as below.  

 

The core of our anti-corruption culture could be summarised as a four segmented categories. Of the 

four segmented categories, we have established anti-corruption policies, periodic conflict of interest 

declaration and whistle blowing channel. For internal questionnaires, it would be a set of 

questionnaire about anti-corruption established and communicated to our staff to provide training 

and ensure understanding about anti-corruption. We are still working towards the goals of 

implementing the internal questionnaires.

we are still in progress to implement our internal questionnaires throughout our group and we will be 

looking forward to implementing internal questionnaires to complement current anti-corruption 

practices in place. With the anti-corruption practices and culture established by our Group, we are 

pleased to note that we did not have any incident of corruption that was found to be substantiated 

for FY 2018. 

Progress update and goals for subsequent reporting:  

We will continue to cultivate a culture which forbids corruption and work towards ensuring zero 

confirmed incidents of corruption for the upcoming year.

MEDICAL WASTE AND EFFLUENTS 

 

The different types of medical waste handled by the Group remains largely unchanged and details of 

the handling methods can be observed in our first sustainability report, a summary of the types of 

medical waste handled by the Group can be seen as below.  

Type of pharmaceutical waste 

General Pharmaceutical Waste 

Special Pharmaceutical Waste 

- 

Pharmaceutical products such as vitamins, over 

the 

counter 

medications, 

and 

most 

prescription-only medications such as anti-

hypertensive, anti-diabetics etc. 

- 

Anti-infective, 

vaccines 

and 

other 

immunological products 

 

- 

Antineoplastic drugs 

- 

Controlled drugs 

- 

Pharmaceutical products and medical 

devices containing heavy metals 

 

As we continue to commit our efforts in ensuring that we handle the medical waste in a safe and 

sustainable manner, we continuously assess our vendors for external medical waste handling services 

on an ad-hoc basis to ensure that the service provided are in line with our expectations. For our 

internal practices, we ensure that our staff are trained and are qualified to identify the different types 

of pharmaceutical waste to facilitate the appropriate disposal to be in compliance with the relevant 

medical regulations. 

In FY2018, we have managed to obtain more information with regard to the medical waste 

management, including quantitative costs of medical waste disposed in FY2018 being $22,505 and the 

amount of waste disposed being approximately 5800 litres. 

Target for subsequent reporting: 

Moving forward, we will continue to monitor the medical waste disposal and continue to look for 

opportunity to integrate more sustainable measures. We aim to achieve more efficient disposal of 

medical waste while ensuring that our vendors continue to perform and deliver service that is in line 

with our expectations and criteria.

TRAINING AND EDUCATION  

 

As we continue to progress as an organisation, we continue to deploy our efforts in ensuring that 

training and education continue to play an important role. Training costs for our employees from 

January 2018 to December 2018 amounted to $38,342 with more than 804 hours of training recorded 

through the different type of courses our staff enrolled. To improve their efficiency, some of our staff 

took part in analytic courses in their relevant field whilst technical trainings and knowledge sharing 

conventions and exhibitions continue to be the bulk of the training and education of our employees. 

We also began on utilising external initiatives such as skills development fund to complement our 

human resource policy benefits and provide addition subsidy. We consistently encourage our staff to 

continue to develop their technical skills and gather insights from our fellow professionals through 

participation in external trainings and courses. In-house trainings and on-job trainings are also a 

common sight due to the culture established by the Group as peers and fellow professional often 

share guidance and tips on their jobs with each other. 

Being in line with the goals set previously, we maintained average staff training of more than 8 hours 

annually and continued to ensure that all of our qualified staff and employees undergo periodic 

performance review. For statistics on FY2017 and FY2018 staff training and education, please see the 

tables below.

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 

 

As we continue to provide our employees with progression opportunities in a fair and equal manner, 

we continue to oversee the various roles and scopes of our staff to make necessary amendments to 

their job coverage according to the changes and progression of both the society and the Group. 

The Tripartite Alliance for Fair &amp; Progressive Employment Practices (“TAFEP”) continue to part of our 

guidelines in our recruitment and selection process while the code of conduct assists to promote a 

culture to prevent discrimination in all areas. Efforts are continuously put in place to ensure that all 

employees are given a fair opportunity in their jobs and measures such as periodic review are also 

channels of two-way communication, taking inputs from both reviewers and reviewees, reflecting the 

stance that the Group holds on equal opportunity. 

During FY2018, there were no incidents of discrimination reported within our Group. Statistics for 

FY2017 and FY2018 regarding diversity and equal opportunity are indicated below.

CUSTOMER PRIVACY 

 

With the advancement of technology, the information obtained and source of information continue 

to grow for our Group. Emphasis on maintaining our patients’ and clients’ privacy continue to be one 

of the key components of the Group. Apart from complying with Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”) 

and appointment of a PDPA officer, we have also established response time frames across our Group. 

With a PDPA officer appointed, we would update the contact details onto our website for easy 

communication with the address of dpo@healthwaymedical.com. 

Departments in our group have access to various documents and information, some of which contains 

personnel information. The table below illustrates the documents and sources of information. 

Documents and/or Source of information 

Clinic management system (“CMS”) 

Patient refund forms 

Website and web forms 

Vendor &amp; petty cash claim system 

Emails and fax  

Sales channels 

Invoices 

Medical chits 

 

To ensure confidentiality and maintain our customer privacy, protection mechanism and security 

controls are established within our Group amongst our various department. Information in clinic 

management system are only made accessible in clinics. We also ensure that patient information is 

not disclosed over phone and any query of information can only be made when the patient is 

physically present to provide verification. Internally, our practices only allow access to patient details 

by relevant department and all information of our corporate clients are controlled by our sales 

personnel, softcopy information including data in IT systems are made accessible to the specific 

personnel who has a user login. Softcopy in transit is password protected and hardcopy information 

are filed and locked. 

Apart from that, our IT department have also established controls to limit access and extraction of 

information governed by our software and IT system. Access controls are role-based and only granted 

on a need-be basis and authorised approvals are required for data extraction requests. Detailed 

logging mechanism in generating and exporting reports in CMS are also a feature to provide an audit 

trail should we require it. For hardware and in-built infrastructure, the Group also included limitations 

to accessing information and established safeguards with some of the details as listed below: 

PC/Laptop Security 

(1) No administrator access for desktop 

(2) Bitlocker encryption for laptops 

(3) Endpoint Security (Symantec Endpoint) 

Network/Infrastructure/Servers 

(1) Perimeter Firewalls (UTM) and Security Groups 

(2) Web Application Firewall 

(3) Geolocation blocking 

(4) IP Whitelisting (CMS) 

(5) VPN for external access (CMS) 

(6) Intelligent Threat Detection (AWS Guard Duty) 


19 

 



(7) Controlled Ports/Only needed ports are open 

(8) Enforced 2FA for console access 

(9) No direct remote access to servers/Jump-host setup 

(10) Database and other critical servers are in a Private Subnet (Not accessible via internet) 

(11) Data encryption at rest and in transit including backups 

(12) Servers/Database are shutdown after operating hours 

 

There were two incidents of customer complaints relating to customer privacy matter noted by our 

Group during the year. One of such incidents was a customer complaint to the Personal Data 

Protection Commission, an external committee enforcing the PDPA. No further action was taken by 

the Personal Data Protection Commission. The second complaint was a complaint to Ministry of Health 

(“MOH”). Further investigations were conducted by MOH and there were no issues noted with our 

handling methods and therefore no further actions were taken as well. 

Target for subsequent reporting: 

Privacy of our patients and customers will continue to be a focus for our Group and we will strive 

towards the target of zero complaints and incidents with regard to customer privacy by strengthening 

our internal control efforts and consistently keeping ourselves updated with the latest regulatory 

changes to ensure the Group’s procedures are up to date.
