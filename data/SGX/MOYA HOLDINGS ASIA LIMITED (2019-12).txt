MOYA HOLDINGS ASIA LIMITED | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

On behalf of the board of directors (“Board”) of Moya Holdings Asia Limited (the “Company” or “Moya”, and together with its 

subsidiaries, the “Group”), we are pleased to present stakeholders with the Company’s sustainability report for the financial year 

ended 31 December (“FY”) 2019.

ENHANCING OUR TEAM

At the start of 2019, the Board pushed for the Group to deepen and better internalise our sustainability strategies. The Group’s 

sustainability team was then expanded from previously a task force to a dedicated full division within the Group. The goal is 

for every business unit within Moya to work together with the Group’s senior management to meet the rising sustainability 

performance standards.

SUSTAINABILITY MEETS OPERATIONS

As the Group’s senior management re-orients itself towards higher sustainability goals across the Group, it was equally critical 

that the effort cascaded down to the operational levels. This was facilitated by a rigorous sustainability training program for senior 

and mid-level operation teams. The operation teams were introduced to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, GRI 

Standards Reporting Framework and how sustainability creates economic value for various stakeholders. Sustainability training is 

now a key component in our human resource development.

Importantly, the training and knowledge-transfer set the foundation for more informed discussions and planning at the operational 

levels. Our goal is for more effective and result-oriented dynamic between the Group’s operations and management as we refine 

our sustainability strategy and implementations.

EFFICIENCY-DRIVEN PROFITABILITY

Sustainability is not sustainable without alignment with economic goals. As the Group expanded sales volumes, it continued 

its efficiency-driven initiatives across its operating companies and improved overall governance. The Group’s initiatives included 

adopting new technologies, streamlining business processes, and centralising supply chain.

The Group achieved an admirable performance in FY2019. Revenue increased by 8.7% year-on-year (“YoY”) to S$205.8 million in 

FY2019, mainly attributed to an increase of water sales volume.

The higher revenue brought better profitability, in which the Group’s gross profit increased by 13.1% YoY to S$96.4 million in 

FY2019, and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization charges (“Adjusted EBITDA”) increased by 18.4% 

YoY to S$82.2 million in FY2019.

MINIMISING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

We are mindful that as the Group expands, so will its resource consumption and environmental impact. We are pleased to note that 

the Group’s energy intensity is maintained at 2.46 megajoules per dollar of revenue in FY2019, despite the 12.5% increase in the 

Group’s energy consumption to 391,850 gigajoules in FY2019.

Following the Group’s industry-leading investments in sludge management in 2016, it experienced significant capacity 

enhancements whereby its sludge treatment facilities were able to respond quickly and efficiently to different water intake 

conditions. As sludge is one of the most significant adverse factors in the water treatment industry, the Group is committed to 

drive improvements further up and down the process chain.

COMBATING COVID-19 ON ALL FRONTS

At the end of 2019, the world faced a new pandemic, a corona virus disease or COVID-19. It has now spread to every country with 

devastating human and economic impact. The situation is still evolving and the effects are unpredictable.

CHAIRMAN AND CEO 

STATEMENT


02

MOYA HOLDINGS ASIA LIMITED | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

The Group responded early and rapidly by activating our business continuity plans to safeguard our employees, customers and our 

assets. By end of January 2020, management instituted restrictions on international travel, followed by health-screening, access 

controls and safe distancing at all our offices and facilities. We also implemented a work from home policy and clustering policy 

since early March 2020. All employees have received extensive training on personal hygiene practices to protect themselves and 

their families against COVID-19. 

At our water treatment facilities, we have taken enhanced safety and security measures to ensure that our output is not endangered 

and disrupted. With re-engineered work processes, we ensured that all our plants continued to operate at full capacity with 

significantly smaller onsite teams.

The emergence of COVID-19 has severed the flow of goods and people in Jakarta and Indonesia. The Group, through its subsidiary, 

Aetra Air Jakarta (“AAJ”) has supported the Jakarta government efforts to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 by supplying 

water to the public hand wash facilities at various public transportation hubs. AAJ also donated 20,000 packages of basic food to 

the government of Jakarta through Jakarta Development Collaboration Network (KSBB program) and PMI (Indonesian Red Cross). 

The Group made additional donations of food packages, hospital beds, bunk beds, hazmat suits, face masks, hospital linens and 

other supporting requirements for hospitals, and shelters for COVID-19 patients in Tangerang City and Tangerang Regency.

2019 APEX CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY AWARD BY GCNS

One of the major highlights of FY2019 was the Group’s win at the prestigious 2019 Apex Corporate Sustainability Award in the 

Sustainable Solutions category. This award, held in Singapore on an annual basis, is organised by Global Compact Network 

Singapore (GCNS), the local chapter of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). The award was given for excellence in corporate 

sustainability. Winners are selected after rigorous evaluation and judging by industry experts and business leaders.

This award is a testimony to the Group’s valuable mission in investing in projects with wide social impacts that extend beyond 

financial returns. Undoubtedly, the award has spurred the Group to continually excel in its contributions to the community. It will 

also raise our standards to regional and international benchmarks of sustainability performance.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

As the Group continues to expand, the Board and management recognise that sustainability is about the widest possible 

engagement with our stakeholders. Therefore, our sustainability success, is by definition an inclusive team effort. We would like to 

express our heartfelt appreciation to our management, staff, and partners who contributed directly and indirectly to this report.

The Board and management would also like to welcome Mr Kuntoro Mangkusubroto as the new chairman of the Board, who with 

his wealth of experience, will provide valuable guidance to the Group.

The efforts and achievements of FY2019 has continued to pave the way forward for the Group, in not only identifying opportunities, 

but also to embrace all the environmental and sustainability challenges with confidence and a can-do spirit.

MATERIALITY 

ASSESSMENT

Our Sustainability Division has reviewed the material ESG factors considered in our previous reports in FY2017 and FY2018, and 

considered stakeholder comments and feedbacks, employee involvement, and industrial group standards. By encompassing these 

factors into consideration, we can then precisely determine the material impacts of our group assessment and fill up the voids in 

our approaches to long-term sustainability.

Our Sustainability Division has reviewed all ESG factors that had been identified in previous two fiscal years and concluded that all 

factors remain imperative in FY2019 for the progress of Moya as a whole.

WATER AND EFFLUENTS (GRI 303)

With water being an extremely scarce resource, water shortage 

is slowly manifesting to a problem in Asia. Back at Moya, we 

offer cutting edge water treatment processes for water to be 

consumed in offices. Due to our dependence on water, we 

embrace the environmental, social and economic impacts that 

follows our usage. By doing so, we are able to tackle this rising 

concern with a multifaceted risk management approach.

As a role model in this industry, Moya sets high standards 

via our strict compliance to all governmental regulations 

regarding the withdrawal of water from approved bodies. 

This compliance stems from an ecological point of view as 

these water bodies serve as a key habitat to enrich and protect 

our local flora and fauna. The rich biodiversity blessed in our 

bodies may also serve as a source of livelihood for our locals who depend on fishing and tourism as a source of income. Therefore, 

it is integral for our management to consider the material and non-material standards of living of these local communities as well. 

By taking all these factors into consideration, Moya ensures the amount of water we draw remains sustainable to our community.

EFFLUENTS AND WASTE (GRI 306)

During the process of removing impurities to obtain purified 

water, waste is generated as an inevitable by-product. Effluents 

are defined as facility-treated water that is then discharged 

back into the environment.

Proper disposal and treatment of waste generated from our 

operation is of great importance in our work culture. A sub-

par effort in the dealing of waste may potentially result in 

negative consequences to both the health of locals exposed to 

such waste as well as the environment. In conjunction with the 

continuous efforts and investments to develop safer effluent 

and waste management processes, Moya strictly complies with 

extensive operational rules and regulations.

With major investments in our sludge management in 2016, our sludge treatment facilities were able to respond quickly and 

efficiently to different input conditions through FY2019. Moya will drive improvements further through the entire process chain so 

that we continually minimise our Group’s adverse environmental impact due to sludge.

Table 8. Effluents and Waste disposal.

We have sludge processing installed in all of our water 

treatment plants. The amount of sludge processed is a function 

of the condition of the raw water coming into our processing 

plants.

Moya’s ability to deliver clean water from our facilities for 

consumption stems from rounds of rigorous testing and 

development to ensure that our product is in line with 

standards set. Moya remains committed to continue to 

look for and invest in innovations and processes that are 

environmentally responsible and friendly.

In order to nurture a sense of environmental conscientiousness, 

our staff undergo continuous education on improvements that 

are regularly executed after undertaking regular operational 

reviews. In addition, Moya exemplifies the need to stay updated on the latest regulatory changes and the importance of strict 

adherence to policies and procedures.

ENERGY AND EMISSIONS (GRI 302 AND 305)

Moya ensures that our continual expansion in the water 

treatment industry is in adherence to key operating principles. 

With Moya’s gradual expansion through acquisitions, facilities 

enhancement, and opening of new treatment plants, the 

importance of prudent planning remains critical to our 

management. Despite an increase in energy consumption 

from FY2018 to FY2019, Moya prioritizes energy efficiency 

as one of its key factors of growth, resulting in stable energy 

intensity.

Moya will strive to provide more value through improvements 

in operational quality and energy utilisation along the 

operational chains.

Moya is pleased to report that we have yet again met our 

zero-fatality target in FY2019, resulting in no work-related 

fatalities for two consecutive years. The Group establishes 

an Occupational Safety and Health Management Committee 

(P2K3) which has full authority on the management of OSH and 

the Environment. The Group is committed to implementing 

and improving the performance of OHS and Environmental 

management systems and international standards (OHSAS 

18001: 2007) through its HIRADC (Hazard Identification, Risk 

Assessment and Determining Controls) policy. In 2018, PT. 

Moya Indonesia and Acuatico Pte Ltd obtained the OHSAS 

18001: 2007 occupational health and safety management 

system certificates, after a series of internal and external audits. 

OHSAS requires that organisations establish, implement and 

maintain procedures for ongoing hazard identification, risk assessment, and the determination of necessary controls. These areas 

may include, but not limited to:

1. The design of work areas, processes, installations, machinery/equipment, operating procedures, and work organization

2. The adaptation to human capabilities

3. Modifications to the OHS management system

4. Temporary changes and their impacts on operations, processes and activities

Consistent with our value of promoting a safe work culture, Moya regularly conducts training and safety lessons such as hazard 

identification. An extensive knowledge of equipment in our plants will allow for early identification of malfunctioning equipment, 

preventing accidents from happening since they will be sent for repair before resuming their respective operations. In addition, 

our staff are well updated on standard operating procedures and regulations through our many seminars to ensure safety. Staff 

are always welcome to clarify any doubts, queries, and offer constructive feedback in an open manner, removing the excessive 

reliance on red tape and bureaucracy. This practice allows for efficient problem solving in Moya, further improving upon our 

current policies.

CASE STUDY 1: GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE (GRI) STANDARDS TRAINING WITH CAPITAL 

GOVERNANCE

In 2019, Moya invited Paul R. Chan, Principal and a GRI certified trainer from Capital Governance 

(member of Foo Kon Tan Group) to conduct a two day course on GRI standards. Global Reporting 

Initiative (GRI), is an established format of writing practiced by 74% of the world’s largest corporations. 

The course is segmented into 5 different parts, starting with introduction and background of GRI, 

Overview of the GRI standards, GRI standards, Reporting processes using the GRI standards and 

finally Application of additional resources.

GRI standards can further be broken down into 4 categories: Foundation, Economic, Environment 

and Social.

With Moya’s key area of business being in water, the environment plays a huge role in its establishment 

and growth. The course identified several environment specific modules: Water and Effluents (303), 

Effluents and Waste (306), and Emission (305) where an in-depth analysis was provided to guide 

Moya on how the Group could encompass its continual effort in environmental conservation in 

report writing.

In addition to that, economic and social reporting formats were also covered to provide Moya with a 

comprehensive coverage on report writing in accordance with the GRI format. In return, this course 

had provided the Group with a deeper insight and clarity on sustainability report writing.



SOCIAL 

RESPONSIBILITY

In ensuring that our employees remain healthy, we adhere strictly to Indonesian manpower regulations. This requires employers 

to arrange for annual medical check-ups with approved hospitals or clinics as well as attending occupational disease programs. 

These check-ups consist of medical health assessment, physical examination and specific screening including several medical tests 

such as X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), and Urine Analysis. Staff are also granted medical benefits including outpatient care and 

inpatient coverage of hospitalization, in accordance to their position.

CASE STUDY 2: MOYA WINS BIG AT THE GCNS APEX SUSTAINABILITY AWARD

6 November 2019 will remain as a day to remember as MOYA brought home the prestigious 2019 

Apex Corporate Sustainability Award in the Sustainable Solutions category on Singapore Apex 

Corporate Sustainability Awards 2019 Gala Dinner; Minister of Education (Singapore), Mr Ong Ye 

Kung, being the guest of honour.

The annual award was organised by Global Compact Network Singapore (GCNS), the local chapter 

of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). The award recognises and honours continued 

excellence in upholding high standards of corporate sustainability. Winners were selected after 

rigorous rounds of evaluation and judging by a panel of industry experts and business leaders.

The GCNS award contest gave MOYA a significant platform to share its sustainability story. The 

MOYA Sustainability Management team - with the guidance of its sustainability advisors, Capital 

Governance – steered key teams in the Group to showcase their major achievements to the GCNS 

judges. The award was received by key members of the Board of Directors and management of the 

Company, and the news was celebrated across the Group.

We are a firm believer that providing solutions and helping our communities are key to our success. 

Moya launched our sustainability strategies in 2016 and made it our core business efforts. A 

corporate culture of sustainability is a source of competitive advantage in the long run with key 

focus on how water is to be managed as a shared resource and how local stakeholders can be more 

actively involved”, said Mr Mohammad Syahrial, Chief Executive Officer, Moya Holdings Asia Limited.

PROVIDING ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER

Water is an important source of life and it should be a basic need for all. At Moya, we stand by our convictions that everyone ought 

to have the right to access clean water. Through a water kiosk mechanism, we have provided clean water access assistance for both 

victims of flood and fire disasters who had been unable to receive clean water. The Group was also involved in the construction of 

water faucets across 10 locations to ensure access to drinking water. As of 2019, we have introduced the Clean Water Access Program 

as part of our social initiatives. Four major forms of water distribution model were also developed for various communities: –

1. Master Meter: a temporary solution for fulfilling access to clean water for people living in illegal settlement areas.

2. Water kiosk: for people who do not have access to water supply, managed by Kelompok Swadaya Pengguna Air (Water User 

Self Help Group).

3. Portable tap water: distributed to 10 additional locations.

4. Provided water to hand washing facilities: distributed specifically across 27 public transport hubs in Jakarta. These hubs include, 

among others, the Boulevard Utara Station, Pulmos Station, TU Gas Station, UNJ Busway Stop and, Kelurahan Ancol Office.

NATURE CONSERVATION 

Rivers and reservoirs play a significant role in protecting the 

long-term sustainable extraction of water. It is crucial that Moya 

is able to ensure that such natural resources are kept in good 

conditions for continued usage, as well as to take into account 

the tangible dependence local communities have on these 

water bodies. We are committed to carrying out tree planting 

conservation and eco-oriented involvement programs in an 

effort to raise awareness towards the significance of conserving 

the flora and fauna within the local community. Various 

community empowerment activities were carried out in line 

with the implementation of World Water Day 2019.

EDUCATION 

Together with the initiatives to create environmental 

awareness, Moya strives to reach out to communities by 

educating them about clean water processes. As of FY2019, 

the Group conducted Educational Programs targeted towards 

students from elementary to tertiary levels, customers, 

and local government-owned water treatment companies 

(PDAMs) to lay the foundations of understanding the 

importance of conserving water. A visit to the Buraran and 

Pulogadung’s Water Treatment Plant enabled these students 

to be exposed to the advanced innovations of developing 

clean water systems. These education programs aim to 

translate this knowledge by disseminating a milestone change 

within community members to learn, appreciate, and value 

environmental conservation activities.

In October 2019, a Hand Washing Campaign 

was held to commemorate World Handwashing

Day with the objective of fostering student 

awareness of the importance of washing 

hands, introducing clean and healthy lifestyle 

from an early age.

Additionally, 

school

programmes were introduced to improve the 

community’s health level through better and 

cleaner sanitation facilities utilization. Notably, 

PT Aetra Tangerang renovated sanitation 

facilities in four schools.

Lastly, in conjunction with National Health Day, 

health seminars were organized to increase 

public awareness, particularly for students, 

to understand the importance of healthy 

behaviour and environment.

DONATIONS 

On December 2019, Indonesia’s Natural Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) released a report citing that in 2019, there had been 

3,622 natural disasters, of which 90 percent (2,699) had been due to hydrometeorological phenomena. More than 475 people were 

reported dead, with 108 missing.

As the size of the Group increases, so does our civic responsibility to help those in need. Donations were given to victims of natural 

disasters that occur nationwide, as well as local natural disasters in service areas such as flood and fire victims by providing access 

to clean water supply, as well as providing compensation for other natural disasters.

Notably, we provided assistance for clean water access through tank cars in areas affected by fire disasters. By FY2019, these acts of 

assistance enabled a total of 193,000 litres of water to be distributed to victims of fire and those who experienced drought in their 

respective areas. Moya acknowledges the urgency to respond swiftly to help communities in crisis areas and we will not hesitate 

to provide relief wherever possible going forward.
