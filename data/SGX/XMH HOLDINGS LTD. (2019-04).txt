ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

 

12 

The Group’s business activities are: 

1) Distribution and provision of value-added products and services; 

2) After-sales services, trading and others; and 

3) Projects, which comprise the assembly and installation of standby generator sets and provision 

of related services, and the design and manufacturer of marine switch boards, remote control 

distributor system and marine automation products. 

XMH will explore initiatives to improve its financials and operations. We have been working well with 

our established partners to ensure that relationships forged will be mutually beneficial to our economic 

and operational stability. 

 

 

The Group recorded a net loss attributable to shareholders of S$3,338,000. This was mainly due to 

weak revenue arising from the challenging environment in which the Group operates in, together with 

aggressive competition faced and weak demand for marine related products. 

For more information on XMH’s economic performance, please refer to our AR 2019 – Operations 

and Financial Review (page 12) and Financial Statements (page 57) for detailed financial performance 

of the Group. 

 

For FY2020, we have set our sights on our longer-term growth strategy and strengthen our foundation 

amidst aggressive competition in our businesses. We will continue to leverage on our expertise as a 

comprehensive power generating solutions provider to the marine and industrial sectors across Asia.

Company’s growth in the future. XMH also provides a wide range of benefits for full time employment 

such as: 

• 

Insurance coverage and healthcare benefits

Moving forward, we hope to improve the working environment and create more value for our 

employees through different initiatives, such as trainings or job rotation to expose our employees to 

different skillsets and areas of expertise. We seek to achieve effective communication across the 

organisation by gathering valuable feedback from our employees to ensure continuous improvement of 

the workplace environment. We will continue to practice non-discrimination in hiring employees of 

different age groups and ensure gender equality at all times.  

 

 


EMPLOYMENT  

 

15 

Training 

XMH believes in upgrading one’s skills to cater to evolving and dynamic working environments. We 

have career development programs for all levels of employees to equip them with the skillsets required. 

Our employees receive periodic performance reviews in accordance with our human resource policy. 

In FY2019, all our staff received regular performance reviews in line with the Group’s policies. 

Furthermore, XMH advocates two-way communication between employees and their superiors. Any 

concerns would be reported to their superiors, which would help to identify opportunities for changes 

to enhance the working environment in XMH. For FY2020, the Group hopes to conduct more in-house 

and on-the-job trainings for employees, approximately 200 hours to better familiarise themselves with 

the operations.

Quality of Sales and Services 

 

We take pride in our products and services delivered to the customers. Maintaining the quality of 

products sold and services rendered remain as one of the key fundamentals in our business. We place 

great emphasis on quality control to ensure consistent quality standards that meet the requirements of 

our customers. In FY2019, there were no instances of customers rejecting deliveries due to defective or 

unsatisfactory products.  

Our quality control personnel work closely with our production team to ensure that the existing 

production flow and methods achieve the required standards of quality, and that innovation and 

improvements are continually introduced to our business processes to improve quality standards. We 

pledge to deliver prompt and optimally dependable solutions that meet the dynamic requirements of our 

customers. As such, we have established the following quality assurance and control systems to ensure 

consistency in the quality of our services and the products and services that we deliver.  

 

Product Handling and Service Quality Check Procedures 

Products purchased/designed/manufactured, including technical specifications and 

compliance documents, are inspected at various stages. It is our policy to track and keep 

internal records of all incoming diesel engines, power generating sets and certain related 

components to allow us to provide timely feedback to our principals and/or suppliers. 

Outgoing products are checked against order specification and load tested before delivery 

to our customers, including supervision on installation and commissioning to ensure they 

meet the requisite performance specifications. 

Customer Relationship Management 

We believe that feedback from our customers and our timely response is vital for us 

to remain competitive in this industry. We ensure that our sales and services staff 

receive adequate training and are equipped with the necessary skills and right attitudes 

when dealing and negotiating with our customers. We have implemented an Enterprise 

Resource Planning (“ERP”) system which allows us to track our sales leads and 

enquiries, customer feedbacks and our follow-up actions.   


LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE 

 

17 

XMH’s Ethical Principles 

 

Anti-corruption 

XMH believes that good corporate governance within the organisation establishes and maintains an 

ethical working environment for all employees. XMH has put in place a whistle-blowing policy outlined 

in the employee handbook to emphasise the importance of ethical business practices. The Group 

encourages any employee to whistle-blow and raise any concerns relating to any suspected improper 

business activities. In the event of a reported whistleblowing case, the Audit Committee ensures that an 

investigation is carried out and followed by appropriate remedial actions. 

In FY2019, we had zero cases of corruption highlighted to the Audit Committee. Moving forward, the 

Group will continue to uphold good corporate governance and comply with the relevant laws and 

regulations that the business operates in. We hope to maintain the target of zero reports on potential 

corruption cases for FY2020. 

 

Environmental and Socioeconomic Compliance 

XMH is aware of the potential exposure and resulting penalties of not complying with the relevant laws 

and regulations, including our products and services which may cause the Group to suffer from 

reputation damage and loss of business opportunities. Through an established business strategy/ model 

that incorporates ethical principles and accountability, the Group is committed to keeping the business 

sustainable. We ensure that we are fully compliant with applicable laws and regulations. In FY2019, 

there were no incidents of non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations that could result in either 

public allegation of non-compliance or penalties. Moving forward for FY2020, we hope to maintain the 

target of zero incidents reported to uphold good governance practice and comply with laws and 

regulations.
