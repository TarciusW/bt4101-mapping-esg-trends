and needs of our stakeholders. A company-wide survey along 

with a focus group study with key internal stakeholders from 

JC&amp;C, our subsidiaries and parent company, was undertaken 

to better understand the expectations they had of JC&amp;C. 

This resulted in Staff Diversity and Equal Opportunities 

being added into the material topics for JC&amp;C this year. 

Secondly, JC&amp;C conducted a climate risk assessment  

to embed climate resilience into our long-term business 

strategy. We recognise the importance of climate-related 

risks to our businesses and the environment. 

Thirdly, we conducted a social impact assessment across 

our portfolio companies to elevate our corporate social 

responsibility (“CSR”) agenda to the Group level and ensure 

that our community engagement is producing positive 

and effective benefits. 

Finally, the inclusion of sustainability metrics into our 

capital allocation strategy is more important now than 

ever as we look into new future investments as a 

responsible investor. 

As we look ahead, we will continue to strengthen our 

commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development 

Goals (“UN SDGs”), as well as incorporate the Task Force 

on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) principles 

within our business and in our reporting. We seek the 

support of our employees, shareholders, and business 

partners as we look towards a more sustainable future.

MESSAGE FROM THE GROUP MANAGING DIRECTOR

(GRI 102-14)

2020 was a challenging year for the Group. It was also 

one filled with opportunities to grow as a company and 

with the community. Amidst the unprecedented impact  

of the COVID-19 pandemic, our commitment towards 

Southeast Asia did not waver. Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage 

(“JC&amp;C”) continued to maintain high standards in both 

financial and non-financial metrics. 

Our purpose, to create growth for Southeast Asia and elevate 

our communities, puts sustainability practices at the forefront 

of our business and integrates them within our strategy. 

To better position ourselves within the changing landscape 

today, JC&amp;C has taken active steps to measure our level of 

readiness, start conversations with our subsidiaries and 

business associates, and chart our roadmap to attain our 

sustainability goals. 

ELEVATING OUR SUSTAINABILITY 

JOURNEY

JC&amp;C is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen. 

We reviewed the material ESG topics of our portfolio to 

ensure that the actions taken by the businesses align  

with the Group's business goals, while also being able to 

positively impact both the planet and our communities. 

Firstly, you will find a new approach to materiality as you 

read through the Sustainability Report 2020. This ensures 

that JC&amp;C is focused on the areas where we can make a 

positive impact, while also reflecting the evolving interests

NAVIGATING THROUGH THE PANDEMIC 

COVID-19 impacted not only our businesses, but also was  

a threat to the health and safety of our employees and 

customers. From the onset, our priority was to take care 

of our employees and customers as well as extend support 

to our local communities. We also ensured that business 

continued as smoothly as possible and where challenges 

existed, innovative changes were made to accommodate  

the new norm. 

We enhanced the standard of health and safety for our 

employees, increased support for telecommuting and 

provided updated information to all employees following 

the changing guidelines. We also worked closely with 

authorities to ensure our facilities were kept in the best 

condition to run our businesses, while keeping our 

employees, customers, and partners safe. 

Apart from physical health, we were aware of the implications 

that COVID-19 and Working From Home had on the mental 

health of our employees. Virtual wellness programmes 

and e-guides were regularly uploaded onto JC&amp;C’s internal 

employee communications platform. We organised virtual 

staff communication sessions for JC&amp;C employees to 

interact and provide updates on business highlights and 

developments. In a period of isolation, we saw the need to 

come together through other mediums to look out for one 

another and build unity.

In addition, we implemented the Employee Assistance 

Programme, a 24-hour anonymous counselling hotline,  

to offer help to employees in need. Our line managers 

underwent mental health training to better equip themselves 

with the right skills to identify mental health issues amongst 

their team members and provide assistance accordingly. 

On the community front, together with Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Singapore, we collectively raised and donated S$83,000  

to REACH Community Services’ “Be our Beacon of Hope” 

fund, which supported over 4,000 beneficiaries including 

low-income families and isolated seniors impacted by 

COVID-19. The fundraising was done through a virtual 

challenge, where employees clocked their steps to raise funds. 

This was an opportunity for employees to bond and keep 

fit at the same time whilst maintaining safe distancing. 

Moreover, I am heartened to share that companies across 

the JC&amp;C Group had likewise stepped up to support their 

respective local communities across the region through 

various efforts and initiatives.

Despite a tough 2020, JC&amp;C remains steadfast in its 

commitment to the long-term growth of the region. Our 

greater focus on sustainability will also support a stronger 

and more resilient Southeast Asia. 

On behalf of the Board and Management, we would like to 

express our appreciation to our people and partners for the 

unwavering support through this challenging year. We look 

forward to continuing our partnerships as we create growth 

for Southeast Asia and elevate communities.

Business sustainability is important to us. JC&amp;C considers

to the long-term viability of our businesses. At JC&amp;C, we 

aim to create growth for Southeast Asia and elevate our 

communities to deliver long-term sustainable value for 

our stakeholders. 

We value the partnerships forged with our people, 

partners and communities. We recognise that our 

investments are in countries that are at vastly different 

stages of economic development and have distinct 

needs in their local communities. Hence, our social 

initiatives are specifically designed to cater to the needs 

of the communities we engage in. 

In Singapore, we drive awareness and support for 

mental health conditions through Jardine Matheson 

Group’s registered charity, MINDSET. We also 

support education across Southeast Asia by way 

of university scholarships.

We recognise that the markets we operate in are at 

different stages of economic development. As such,  

we allow for flexibility amongst our portfolio companies  

to assess the sustainability of their own operations and 

design a tailored sustainability approach for themselves. 

As a holding company, we focus on the governance of our 

Group businesses and the management of sustainability 

at the corporate office level. This involves working closely 

with our portfolio companies to ensure sound corporate 

governance, professionalism, and ethical business conduct. 

We also extend influence over sustainability matters for 

majority-owned investments where we have a larger 

representation on the Board or the management bench. 

For our non-majority owned business interests, we continue 

to provide strategic advice, expertise and influence, where 

appropriate, as partners.

In accordance with Singapore’s Code of Corporate Governance, 

the Board of Directors provides entrepreneurial leadership 

and sets strategic objectives in focus areas of value creation, 

innovation, and sustainability. The Board is supported by 

the JC&amp;C Executive Committee, to manage and oversee 

sustainability practices, and the JC&amp;C Legal &amp; Corporate 

Affairs department, to ensure facilitation and reporting. 

For a full description of Corporate Governance at JC&amp;C, 

please refer to the Annual Report 2020.

JC&amp;C is looking to establish its own sustainability committee 

focusing on its role as an investment holding company, to 

work alongside the Sustainability Steering Committees of 

its portfolio companies to influence and steer the Group’s 

sustainability journey moving forward. 

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

AND MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

APPROACH TO MATERIALITY

We conduct a materiality review every year to ensure 

that our sustainability efforts across the 'Environmental', 

'Social' and 'Governance' ("ESG") aspects are aligned with 

matters that are key to our business and stakeholders. 

By doing so, we can be assured that our sustainability 

strategy is focused on the areas where we can make 

the most impactful change.

In 2020, we refreshed our approach to materiality by 

adopting a greater macro perspective to better identify 

and assess the issues and concerns that matter most 

to our business and stakeholders. This involved the 

following exercises:

 

1. 

INDUSTRY PEER BENCHMARKING

 

 

 We analysed global sustainability studies and 

best practices of industry peers to strengthen 

our understanding of the current and future 

sustainability backdrop.

 

2. 

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

 

 

 We engaged key internal and external stakeholders 

through online surveys and focus group interviews 

to better understand their ESG interests and 

concerns for our business. This allowed us to 

develop a prioritised list of material ESG topics 

to create a refined Materiality Matrix of what our 

stakeholders expect of us. More details can be 

found in the section on Materiality Matrix (page 8).

SUSTAINABILITY AT JC&amp;C

COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY

(GRI 102-16, 102-18)

 

3. 

MATERIALITY WORKSHOP

 

 

 We conducted a materiality workshop involving 

the senior management of JC&amp;C to ensure that 

the prioritisation of the material topics selected 

are relevant and significant for the Group. 

LOOKING FORWARD

The Group has also taken steps towards this current dynamic 

sustainability landscape by conducting a Climate Risk and 

Social Impact current assessment in 2020. Our goals are 

to incorporate climate resilience into our long-term business 

strategy and framework by taking reference from the Task 

Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) 

Framework* and to develop our social efforts as strategic 

drivers for JC&amp;C. 

We are in the planning stage of developing implementation 

programmes after the current state assessments and will 

provide more updates in subsequent reports.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

We are committed to cultivating relationships with our 

stakeholders to build mutually beneficial and enduring 

partnerships through efficient communication. We engage our 

stakeholders through a variety of means, such as meetings, 

reviews, discussions, calls, surveys and focus groups.

In 2020, we continued our stakeholder engagement with a 

focus on sustainability matters and used their input in the 

review and assessment of our ESG material topics. This helped 

to ensure that we remained focused on the ESG topics that 

were most important and relevant to us and our stakeholders.

* The TCFD Framework provides guidance on climate-related financial disclosures  

to help provide better information to support informed capital allocation.

To ensure that our sustainability efforts are aligned with

review the material topics that we report on every year.  

In 2020, our materiality assessment process included an 

employee survey as well as focus groups and discussions 

with the senior leadership and majority shareholder.

MATERIALITY MATRIX

We identified seven material topics for 2020 under the pillars 

of ‘Governance’ and ‘Social’. This year, we have included  

a new topic as part of our material topics – staff diversity 

and equal opportunities. 

No ‘Environment’ topics have been identified at the corporate

Demonstrating strong corporate governance 

We will continue to adhere to the principles and guidelines on 

corporate governance as set out in the SGX Listing Rules and 

Singapore’s Code of Corporate Governance (“CCG”) as updated 

in 2018, focusing on strong corporate governance and 

maintaining high standards for accountability and conduct. 

Providing a healthy and safe workplace

The health and safety of our people are of upmost importance 

and it is our responsibility as an employer to ensure a safe 

working environment for our employees. 

We target zero injuries.

Adopting the TCFD Roadmap

JC&amp;C plans to ramp up our approach to sustainability through 

referencing the TCFD principles.

We are starting dialogues with our portfolio companies through 

Board meetings and conferences to build upon knowledge 

sharing so that together we can enhance our commitment to 

sustainable practices.

Ensuring transparency and anti-corruption

We will continue to ensure that all employees of JC&amp;C are trained 

in and abide by the Code of Conduct (“CoC”). Our target is to 

maintain a 100% training rate, year-on-year, for new hires and 

the re-certification of employees required to undergo training.

Engaging our communities

JC&amp;C is committed to supporting and investing in the 

communities it engages in. The Group will continue to maintain 

our support for mental health through MINDSET. 

Our JC&amp;C Scholarships also enable us to contribute to nurturing 

promising young talents in local universities through endowments 

and long-term donations. 

Elevating the importance of climate action

JC&amp;C plans to form a Sustainability Committee that will meet 

on a quarterly basis and report directly to the Board of Directors. 

This committee will include key personnel from the Communications, 

Finance, Legal and Risk departments. 

This committee aims to elevate climate risk as a key issue in future 

Board meetings, with the objective to push for Group-wide initiatives 

and directions to be implemented.

Sustaining good economic performance

The Group aims to produce sustained growth in shareholder 

value. We actively and regularly review and manage our capital 

structure to ensure optimal capital structure and stakeholder 

returns, taking into consideration the future capital requirements 

of the Group and capital efficiency, prevailing and projected 

profitability, projected operating cash flows, projected capital 

expenditure and projected strategic investment opportunities.

Nurturing and developing our people 

Continuous learning and development will remain a key priority 

for our people.

• 

We aim to achieve an average of 10 hours annual training 

per employee1. 

• 

We will continue to retain our workforce by keeping voluntary 

turnover lower than that of the general industry. 

• 

We aim to sustain our focus on employee wellness and 

prioritises it as one of our employee value propositions. 

• 

We aim to provide support to ensure that 100% of JC&amp;C’s 

new mothers return to work after their maternity leave.

Promoting staff diversity and equal opportunities

We recognise value and strength in the diversity of our people 

and are committed to ensure that every employee has an equal 

opportunity in realising their career aspirations and goals.

DEMONSTRATING STRONG 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, CG-1)

At JC&amp;C, the Board of Directors is the highest governance 

body and is responsible for corporate governance together 

with the management team. The governance body 

includes the Audit Committee, Nominating Committee 

and Remuneration Committee. 

JC&amp;C’s Corporate Governance Policies Manual (“the Manual”) 

assists us to comply with requisite corporate governance 

principles. The Manual sets out the terms of reference for 

the Board and its various committees, and adheres to the 

principles prescribed in Singapore’s Code of Corporate 

Governance (“CCG”) and the SGX Listing Rules. Corporate 

governance policies and procedures are regularly monitored, 

and changes are made where necessary to comply with 

the latest developments in the laws, regulations, and 

practices in Singapore. Periodic audits are also conducted 

by internal and external auditors on our corporate governance 

and reported to the JC&amp;C Audit Committee with any issues 

followed up by management.

In 2020, JC&amp;C achieved an overall rank of #46 in the 

Singapore Governance and Transparency Index published 

by the National University of Singapore Business School, 

which provides corporate governance performance ratings 

for Singapore-listed companies. JC&amp;C's overall score has 

improved consistently over the last three years and it has 

maintained its position within the top 10% of Singapore’s 

listed companies in the corporate governance ranking.

The latest Corporate Governance Report is available on 

our JC&amp;C website. It outlines JC&amp;C’s corporate governance 

practices for the most recently completed financial year 

as well as details the roles of the Board of Directors and 

its committees.

UPHOLDING OUR CODE OF CONDUCT

(GRI 102-16, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 205-3)

Under the JC&amp;C Board’s terms of reference, its role 

includes ensuring that the Company has adequate and 

effective systems of internal controls (including financial, 

operational, compliance and information technology) and 

risk management. No cases of non-compliance with laws 

or regulations were identified for JC&amp;C during 2020.

JC&amp;C adopts the Jardine Matheson Group Code of Conduct 

(the “CoC”). The CoC requires compliance with all relevant 

laws, rules and regulations applicable to each business and 

with proper standards of business conduct. The CoC sets 

out the standards and values that we uphold in operating 

our businesses, covering topics that include, amongst others, 

anti-competitive practices, tax compliance, business licences, 

exchange controls, information security, illicit payments and 

gifts, favours and entertainment.

All new employees are given a copy of the CoC and all 

employees, existing and new, are required to undergo 

regular e-learning training on the CoC. The CoC is made 

available to all employees via an internal communications 

platform, for ease of access.

JC&amp;C’s Board of Directors is responsible for compliance 

with applicable laws and regulations, together with the 

senior management team. Each department head is 

accountable for compliance under their area of responsibility, 

with senior managers tasked with interpreting and adapting 

the policy to their operating environment. Additionally, the 

finance department is responsible for compliance with 

financial reporting and tax requirements, with the legal 

department supporting the overall compliance requirements.

We believe in and encourage early reporting of matters  

of serious concern that may affect the professional and 

compliant operation of our businesses and reputation.  

In addition to the CoC, we also have in place a policy on 

reporting matters of serious concern (whistleblowing policy) 

under the purview of the JC&amp;C Audit Committee. This ensures 

independent investigation and appropriate follow-up action 

on any concerns raised, including anonymous ones. 

Cases reported are monitored by appointed management 

representatives. Our policy on reporting matters of serious 

concern is available on our website as well as on our internal 

communications platform.

ENSURING TRANSPARENCY  

AND ANTI-CORRUPTION

(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 205-3)

We believe a well-managed business and attracting the 

right people to JC&amp;C is vital in upholding our commercial 

standing and reputation. Being transparent and combating 

corruption are necessary to ensure that our operations are 

conducted in a fair and lawful manner.

Our commitment to transparency and anti-corruption is 

reflected in our CoC, which seeks to uphold high standards 

of honesty, integrity, and fair dealing. Our internal policies 

are regularly reviewed for their compliance to local and 

international laws. Annual reviews are also conducted to 

ensure strict compliance with all our policies. 

To enable us to better evaluate the effectiveness of our 

anti-corruption practices, we review our control and 

compliance checklists twice yearly on areas that include 

illicit payments and favours as well as requiring the reporting 

of matters of serious concern. Returns are signed off by 

the business heads and management team before being 

reported to the JC&amp;C Audit Committee for review. The 

Gifts &amp; Hospitality Policy, introduced in 2019, was also 

updated in September 2020. 

All JC&amp;C employees are required to undergo either a CoC 

e-learning course or an anti-corruption training. Recertification 

for the CoC e-learning course is required every two years.  

In 2020, we successfully achieved our target of 100% of 

eligible employees trained and recertified. We have also 

continued to maintain a clean record of zero incidents or 

cases related to corruption. A full breakdown of the numbers 

for the 2020 anti-corruption training is furnished in the 

Appendix: ESG Data.

PROTECTING OUR STAKEHOLDERS’ 

DATA AND PRIVACY

JC&amp;C is committed to safeguarding the personal data  

of our shareholders and business partners in Singapore. 

We have established stringent data protection policies and 

procedures to ensure that our collection, use, disclosure, 

care, retention and transfer of personal data are in compliance 

with the requirements of the Personal Data Protection  

Act 2012 (“PDPA”). Shareholders, business partners and 

customers who have provided their personal data to us 

may also request to access such data, or for us to correct 

and/or delete such personal data collected.

We have further conducted an extensive review of our 

processes in 2020 to ensure compliance with the PDPA, 

and have also appointed key personnel who are responsible 

for, amongst others:

• disseminating information relating to the PDPA and 

data protection policies to employees through training 

modules and cultivating a culture of compliance;

• handling data protection related queries and complaints 

from the relevant stakeholders; alerting management 

to any risks that might arise concerning personal data; 

and

• reporting any data protection matters to the Personal 

Data Protection Commission, where necessary.

As part of our efforts and commitment to ensure that 

our employees are familiar with the PDPA, employees 

are required to undergo regular data protection training. 

To date, over 90% of employees have completed the 

PDPA training. 

SUSTAINING GOOD ECONOMIC 

PERFORMANCE

As a public listed company, JC&amp;C seeks to deliver long-term 

sustainable value for its shareholders through creating 

growth for Southeast Asia and elevating our communities.

ACCOUNTABILITY TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS

JC&amp;C regularly updates on material price-sensitive 

information and reports its financial performance  

on a semi-annual basis. Quarterly updates are provided 

through interim management statements. We also publish 

annual reports with a full set of accounts prepared 

through IFRS.

We regularly review our capital structure to ensure 

optimal shareholder returns. We also consider future 

capital requirements and capital efficiency, prevailing 

and projected profitability, projected operating cash flows, 

capital expenditure, and strategic investment opportunities 

before the distribution of economic value to shareholders. 

The financial performance of JC&amp;C is audited annually 

with the results reported on SGX, thereafter determining 

the share price through the stock market. 

JC&amp;C has policies in place to ensure that goods and services 

obtained or paid for represent good value and are attained 

on fair and competitive terms. We also receive financial 

assistance from the Singapore government in the form 

of tax relief and tax credits, as well as grants.

In 2020, over S$728,908 was received in governmental 

assistance, including S$33,116 in grants for Special 

Employment Credit and Wage Credit Schemes. Of the 

amounts received, 100% of the tax relief and tax credits 

were part of statutory rebates and deductions eligible  

to all Singapore companies, which included S$15,000  

in corporate tax rebates and S$230,468 from tax 

donations to IPC-approved charity organisations.

SOCIAL (PEOPLE)

As an investment holding company, JC&amp;C is office-based 

and headquartered in Singapore. Our material social 

topics are thus primarily focused on the well-being of our 

employees headquartered therein. We believe in fostering 

a culture of engagement in a safe workplace where our 

employees are given a voice, feel heard, and are respected. 

We bring people from diverse expertise, experience, and 

socio-cultural backgrounds together, enabling the Group 

to rise above industry challenges. We encourage the holistic 

development of our workforce, to help them realise their 

fullest potential by engaging them throughout their career 

journey with us.

NURTURING OUR WORKFORCE

(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 401)

Our human resources policy is reviewed regularly by the 

Human Resources (“HR”) department and covers hiring 

and employment including compensation and benefits as 

well as training and development aspects. These reviews 

take place when new policies are announced by relevant 

Singapore authorities or annually, depending on market 

conditions. The policy takes into consideration feedback 

from new hires and exit interviews as well as performance 

reviews and employee engagement results assessed every 

two to three years. The HR department is responsible for 

aligning our practices with all legislative requirements 

while re-evaluating them through insights from participation 

in market surveys.

JC&amp;C ensures the implementation of the provisions as 

stated in Singapore’s Employment Act. We recognise the 

value and importance of having discussions in clearing 

up misunderstandings at the workplace and maintaining 

harmonious relations among employees. Management 

makes every reasonable effort to effect discussions and/or 

investigate any grievance which employees raise. A grievance 

procedure is available to employees. This includes a procedure 

to ensure that grievances are addressed or elevated to 

executive management or the Ministry of Manpower for 

conciliation, failing which the matter may be brought to 

the Commissioner for Labour at the final stage.

our people are able to offer different perspectives and  

ideas to better contribute to the business.

JC&amp;C respects and celebrates the individual strengths

SUPPORTING OUR PEOPLE

(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 401)

Apart from complying with the relevant statutory requirements 

related to employment in Singapore, including retirement 

provisions (“CPF”), we also provide benefits such as medical 

insurance, flexi-working hours, and telecommuting.

Employee remuneration is offered fairly for the value of the 

job and the individual vis-à-vis market conditions. In markets 

where there are statutory minimum wages, the Group 

complies with statutory and regulatory requirements. 

We actively support working parents. All employees are 

eligible for paid parental leave, with an additional six days 

of childcare leave (for those with pre-schoolers) and up to  

six days of unpaid infant care leave annually. We ensure 

that employees receive the statutory maternity leave 

allowance of eight or sixteen weeks in Singapore and 

up to four weeks of shared parental leave. All working 

fathers are also entitled to two weeks of paid paternity leave.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, safe management 

measures and initiatives for employee health and safety have 

also been introduced as elaborated in the following sections.

SOCIAL (PEOPLE)

ENABLING STAFF DEVELOPMENT

(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 401-1, 401-2, 404-3)

We believe in developing employees’ capabilities for their 

current and future roles for the long-term sustainability  

of the business. To encourage further learning, we have  

an Education Assistance Programme that sponsors  

an employee’s education, providing opportunities for 

professional and personal development. In addition,  

talent and succession planning reviews are also in place 

to review career development opportunities. 

The Jardines Learning Academy leverages digital technology 

to provide functional academies online. As it is conducted 

over an interactive e-learning platform, employees can 

engage effectively with the trainer and other employees 

across the wider Jardines Group on topics that are helpful 

and relevant to their career pathways. 

In 2020, we recorded a total of 210.5 hours of training by our 

employees. This reflects a decrease from the previous year 

due to constraints of conducting in-person training courses, 

whilst safe distancing measures were in place, and employees 

were working remotely in response to COVID-19.

Annually, all employees receive a performance and career 

development review. This ensures that employees are on 

track in their career development as well as to align their 

training needs with business objectives. We achieved our 

target of 100% of eligible employees receiving a performance 

review in 2020. A full breakdown of training, performance 

and career development reviews in 2020 is furnished in

ENCOURAGING LONG-TERM CAREERS

We believe in building long-term and fulfilling careers 

for our people. The average length of employment is 

about 10 years, which attests to the effectiveness of 

our employee engagement efforts and the career 

opportunities that we provide.

On an ongoing basis, we review our people policies and 

initiatives for improvement. This includes seeking feedback 

through exit interviews. Information gathered is reviewed and 

analysed on a quarterly basis by our HR division. Retirement 

consultation sessions are held to assess employees’ readiness 

for retirement or re-employment, with options such as part-time 

work or contract work explored during such discussions. 

In 2020, there was one case of retirement.

The health and safety of our people is of paramount 

importance to JC&amp;C. We strive to raise our standards in 

providing a safe and healthy working environment for our 

employees.

MAINTAINING WORKPLACE SAFETY

JC&amp;C complies with the management arrangements set 

out in Singapore’s Workplace Safety &amp; Health Act. Our 

office has designated safety officers who review workplace 

safety guidelines and oversee implementation of measures 

within the premises. Incidents are recorded and investigated, 

with feedback applied to address improvement and prevention 

of incidents. Our office premises have attained the BizSAFE 3 

standard for operations in Singapore and we will strive to 

maintain this. 

Internally, health and safety matters are managed by our 

Workplace Health and Safety Committee and the Company 

Emergency Response Team from Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore. 

The committee comprises the Complex Manager who is 

advised by an external Group Safety Advisor. Each member 

of the Emergency Response Team is required to undergo 

training accredited by the Singapore Civil Defence to attain 

certifications for incident management and response to 

fire incidents at the workplace. Respective sites have their 

own Risk Assessment team members, with a leader who 

is certified by external training providers recognised by  

the Ministry of Manpower, covering risk control measures 

according to the hierarchy of controls. Risk assessments 

are carried out to capture and address risks during business 

processes and work activities. The risk assessment document 

is reviewed once every three years as a validity period 

regardless of changes.

Incident report forms are available for our employees  

to report actual or potential incidents. These forms are 

reviewed by worker representatives and rectifications  

are recommended and implemented. A whistleblowing 

platform is also available for workers to report unsafe 

work conditions confidentially. Workers can feedback 

directly to their supervisor or risk assessment champion 

to highlight work situations that they believe could cause 

injury or ill health.

• Any work-related incident is to be made known  

to the immediate supervisor, following which the  

'Incident Investigation Report' will be completed  

and submitted by the Department Head or Complex 

Manager to the HR Division.

• The 5W (Who, What, Where, When, Why) method 

with immediate cause and preventive measures 

to be indicated and implemented accordingly. 

• If any incident is noted as being due to the lack of 

measures identified in the risk assessment, additional 

measures will be implemented accordingly and relevant 

employees will be informed.

Workplace Safety &amp; Health Meetings are held monthly 

with representatives from management and workers. 

The meeting also consists of neutral parties, namely 

the Safety Officer and Fire Safety Manager, to capture 

any feedback/issues highlighted during the meeting. 

There is a whistleblowing hotline for employees to lodge 

their concerns.

To ensure that the office remains a safe workplace, 

security officers hold workshops and activities to 

familiarise employees with the 5x5 risk assessment 

matrix. The 5x5 risk assessment matrix is recommended 

by the Singapore Workplace Safety and Health Council's Code 

of Practice on Workplace Safety and Health Risk Management 

as a risk assessment framework. The matrix uses three 

key steps to identify priority safe issues in the workplace.

KEEPING OUR WORKFORCE HEALTHY

Our long-term goal is to build a healthy and happy workforce 

to increase workplace productivity. JC&amp;C adopts a work-life 

balance approach by creating a supportive and conducive 

work environment as well as by engaging our employees 

through our Workplace Health Programme (“WHP”) and 

the Group’s Key2Wellness initiative, flexi-work scheme  

and other initiatives. 

These programmes encompass physical, mental, and 

social health initiatives and activities to encourage and 

engage employees to maintain good health. Healthy 

lifestyles are also promoted through lunchtime awareness 

talks, healthy bites meal alternatives, evening exercise 

classes, sporting events, and other interactive activities.

JC&amp;C takes a compassionate approach in providing 

non-occupational medical and healthcare for its employees. 

All employees receive a complimentary health screening 

every three years. The company’s medical outpatient 

programmes cover specialist treatments in all government 

restructured hospitals with no caps. Other treatments such as 

Traditional Chinese Medicine are eligible for reimbursement 

under the company’s outpatient policy. We also provide 

comprehensive medical insurance coverage for inpatient 

treatment and long-term treatment including psychiatric 

care and dialysis. 

For employees who require extended care, the Company 

has a long-term medical leave programme that offers paid 

salary for up to 12 months and guaranteed employment 

up to 18 months while the employee seeks medical recovery.

SOCIAL (PEOPLE)

Additionally, JC&amp;C rolled out an Employee Assistance 

Programme which includes a 24-hour anonymous 

counselling hotline for employees to reach out to  

should they need help.

This year, we have achieved our target of a zero minor-incident 

rate. A full breakdown of health and safety figures for 2020 

is furnished in the Appendix: ESG Data.

PROTECTING EMPLOYEES FROM COVID-19 

From the onset of COVID-19, JC&amp;C extended outpatient 

medical coverage to all new employees under probation 

to ensure that all employees are adequately protected 

by medical coverage. We also implemented safe 

management measures before resuming workplace 

activities after the Circuit Breaker* to provide a safe 

working environment, such as telecommuting. On the 

occasion where telecommuting is not possible, employees  

operate under split-team arrangements. 

With more employees opting to telecommute during the 

COVID-19 pandemic, webinars on workplace ergonomics 

and mental resilience were held along with the distribution 

of health packs to keep the workplace sanitised and to 

improve employees’ engagement. Our Employee Assistance 

Programme provides employees with mental health 

counselling via an anonymous hotline.

* The Circuit Breaker (“CB”) was a stay-at-home lockdown order by the Government  

of Singapore, implemented as a preventive measure in response to the COVID-19 

pandemic. During the CB period, non-essential workplaces were closed, along with  

all schools and student care centres. Religious gatherings as well as eating out 

were prohibited. It was made mandatory to wear masks from 14th April 2020. The 

Circuit Breaker lasted for about two months, from 7th April to 1st June 2020.

INVESTING IN EDUCATION IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 

In 2020, JC&amp;C continued its efforts in raising the educational 

standards of the younger generation across Southeast Asia 

through its Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage scholarships. The 

scholarships comprise a series of endowments and 

donations that are long-term in nature to support the 

educational development of local talents at top-ranking 

universities. This year, seven students from across 

Southeast Asia were each awarded with a JC&amp;C scholarship 

in their respective countries. We regularly check in with 

our university partners and receive updates from them. 

This allows them to express any feedback regarding our 

scholarships should the need arise and encourages constant 

improvement of the programme.

Scholarship candidates are recommended by the universities 

and selected based on academic results, means testing 

(household income levels) and personal traits such as a 

commitment to public duty or the community. JC&amp;C works 

closely with the universities to ensure that all funds are 

properly channelled to the selected students for their

JC&amp;C SCHOLARS’ TESTIMONIALS

“This scholarship has made me realise that there 

are many youths in Thailand like myself, who lack the 

opportunities and funds to pursue education subjects 

which they are passionate about. Through receiving 

the JC&amp;C Scholarship, I understand the importance  

of having a quality foundation in education and am 

inspired to extend my support to children in need.” 

–  Attapon Poncharoen,  

Chulalongkorn University (Thailand) 



“Being a recipient of the JC&amp;C Scholarship has allowed 

me to appreciate the value and importance of giving 

back to the society, especially when we have the 

capability to do so. I now recognise the need to be 

proactive in supporting university education as it will 

help students tremendously. I feel encouraged to give 

back to the community after I graduate, just like how 

the JC&amp;C Scholarship has helped me.”

–  Agnes Abigail Tan,  

National University of Singapore 



“The JC&amp;C Scholarship inspired me to contribute to 

my community. Currently, I am teaching and sharing 

what I have learnt at Vietnam National University with 

children who are unable to afford and access education.  

I hope to continue giving back to the community 

through education even after graduation.”

–  Nguyen Kieu Chinh,  

Vietnam National University



“After receiving the JC&amp;C Scholarship, I’ve learnt that  

it is important for me to give back to the community 

and appreciate the people who helped me get to  

where I am today. Therefore, I intend to maximise  

my university experience through service-learning  

and volunteer opportunities.”

– Khairunnisa Gulamnabi,  

University of Malaya (Malaysia)

EFFORTS IN MENTAL HEALTH

Mental health is a key priority in our social efforts. It is an 

area that we have identified as under-served, and thus hope 

to be able to make a significant impact in. JC&amp;C encourages 

all employees to take care of their mental wellness and 

provides the tools to support them to do so. JC&amp;C also 

aligns its initiatives to the Singapore Ministry of Manpower’s 

Tripartite Advisory on Mental Well-being at Workplaces. 

In 2020, JC&amp;C rolled out its EAP which provides free and 

anonymous counselling for employees via a hotline. To build 

a more understanding community within JC&amp;C, line managers 

are also trained to spot signs of distress among employees 

and provide support towards affected employees. Additionally, 

mental health consultations and treatments are also covered 

under outpatient benefits. 

During the circuit-breaker period, JC&amp;C recognised the 

importance of supporting employees’ mental well-being. 

Mental well-being online workshops and employee bonding 

programmes were launched on the company’s internal 

communications platform. JC&amp;C’s Group Managing Director 

also held several virtual staff communications sessions to 

boost employees’ morale and enhance engagement 

during this difficult period where employees were all 

unable to meet face-to-face.

SOCIAL (COMMUNITY)

At JC&amp;C, we provide volunteer hours, expertise, and 

resources to support the mental health community 

through MINDSET. Our senior leaders and management 

are actively involved in the governance and operations of 

the charity, where the Group Managing Director of JC&amp;C 

is also the Chairman of MINDSET. Our employees support 

the communications, finance and legal functions of 

MINDSET, and our Legal &amp; Corporate Affairs department 

serves as MINDSET’s secretariat to plan, manage, and 

execute initiatives that are aimed at engaging the mental 

health community.

MINDSET upholds high standards of governance and 

transparency to gain our donors’ confidence and trust  

in donating to our cause. It has been awarded the Charity 

Transparency Award for exemplary standards of transparency 

and governance for four consecutive years. In 2020, MINDSET 

and Jardines were named “Champions of Good” by the 

National Volunteer &amp; Philanthropy Centre for leading the 

way in corporate giving.

JC&amp;C employees volunteer as Jardine Ambassadors to 

organise and execute MINDSET activities. This two-year 

stint provides Jardine Ambassadors with opportunities to  

use their skills and experience to build MINDSET initiatives 

and support the mental health community at the same 

time. Since the volunteer programme’s launch in 2012, 

there has been 42 Jardine Ambassadors from JC&amp;C, 

clocking 8,776 volunteer hours. 

Additionally, we strongly believe in the social reintegration 

of persons recovering from mental health issues by advancing 

equitable employment opportunities. Since 2011, MINDSET 

has placed 229 clients within Jardine companies, with 11 

of them in JC&amp;C. MINDSET also facilitated the placement 

of six clients in jobs outside of the Jardines Group, extending 

this meaningful initiative to more companies. 

MINDSET also believes strongly in raising awareness for 

mental health to reduce the stigma against mental health 

illness. This is done through organising awareness events 

and providing thought leadership through panel discussions 

with fellow mental health partners in Singapore. 

In September 2020, MINDSET participated in the “Beyond 

the Label” campaign organised by the National Council of 

Social Services as a supporting partner and panel moderator. 

The panel discussion, which saw over 3,600 views, discussed 

the stressors faced by the sandwich generation in Singapore 

and its repercussions on mental health. 

In December 2020, MINDSET and JC&amp;C partnered with the 

Workwell Leaders Workgroup, chaired by former Nominated 

Member of Parliament, Anthea Ong, to host the “Workwell 

Leaders CEO Dialogue” session. The session saw about 50 

Singapore leaders come together to jointly discuss ways 

to further improve the well-being of the mental health 

community within their organisations and in Singapore  

as a whole. 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, MINDSET had to utilise 

creative and innovative ways to raise funds for mental 

health. Instead of a physical vertical race, MINDSET’s 

annual fundraiser, The MINDSET Challenge &amp; Carnival, 

was done through a vertical platform which encouraged 

participants to race at their convenience around the globe. 

This online vertical race raised S$150,000, which was 

channelled towards DigitalMINDSET, an intervention 

programme for youths facing mental health issues due  

to digital or device addiction.

SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES

In addition to advancing education and empowering the 

mental health community, we actively seek other opportunities 

to best serve the needs and interests of the communities 

we engage with. We believe in touching the lives of the people 

around us through various initiatives that are meaningful 

and positively impactful to give back to the communities 

who work together with us.

LENDING A HELPING HAND DURING THE 

COVID-19 PANDEMIC 

JC&amp;C recognises the importance of strengthening 

the resilience of communities in need during the 

COVID-19 pandemic. 

Together with Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore, we held a 

team steps challenge that garnered the support of over 

250 employees, clocking over 19 million steps within 

a week. A donation drive was held in parallel and these 

initiatives jointly raised S$83,000 for REACH Community 

Services Society’s “Be our Beacon of Hope” fund. 

HELPING TO SECURE A BRIGHTER FUTURE

At JC&amp;C, we also see the significance in supporting the 

next generation, enabling the youth to have opportunities 

to broaden their horizons. 

In October 2020, JC&amp;C contributed a S$10,000 donation 

to The Rice Company’s “Children for Children” fundraiser, 

an annual event jointly organised by The Rice Company, 



&gt;250 employees participated

&gt;19 million steps clocked

S$83,000 raised for REACH Community Services

This fund supports over 4,000 beneficiaries, including 

low-income families and isolated seniors who have  

been impacted by COVID-19. 

CHIJ Kellock, The Business Times, and Resorts 

World Sentosa. The event provides young children 

with opportunities to visit different places of attraction 

in Singapore every Children’s Day, aiming to let more 

children enjoy a fulfilling day exploring new places in 

Singapore. Through the event, children are also exposed 

to the related heritage and diverse cultures of the different 

places of interest in Singapore.
