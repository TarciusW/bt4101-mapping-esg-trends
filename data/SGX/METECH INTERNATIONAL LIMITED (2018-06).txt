1.0 INTRODUCTION 

 

1.1 Corporate Profile 

 

Metech International Limited (the “Company” or “Metech”) and together with its subsidiaries (the 

“Group”) is listed on the Catalist Board of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (the 

“SGX-ST”) with two main core businesses in the electronic waste management and the supply 

chain management. Headquartered and listed in Singapore. In the financial year 2018 (“FY2018), 

we processed over 22 million pounds (10 million kg) of e-waste; and 7,200 tonnes (7.2 million kg) 

of commodities worldwide. 

 

Metech has primarily two major lines of businesses: 

1. Supply-chain Management (“SCM”), which represents about 71% of the revenue; and 

2. Electronic Waste Management (“EWM”)(1), which represents about 29% of the revenue for 

the financial year ended 2018. 

 

The Group’s total business revenue was $97.1m at the end of FY2018. In that year, the Group 

employed about 200 staff, with about 40 in Singapore and 160 in the United States. 

 

 

Corporate Vision and Mission 

 

To conserve and maximise Earth's resources. 

 

To be a provider of smart solutions to bring value and efficiency to the global supply chain. 

 

 

Core Values 

 

Our value proposition is to ensure responsible recycling, provide transparency of process, and 

deliver a full accounting of materials. We are dedicated to strive for the best as we embrace 

innovation and change. We conduct our business with honesty and integrity and shall uphold the 

environment while we carry out our businesses. 

 

_____________ 

(1) Since 18 September 2018, the Company had entered into various conditional sale and 

purchase agreements for the sale of the entire electronic waste management business (the 

“Disposals”). On 12 April 2019, the shareholders duly approved and passed the Disposals of the 

EWM businesses at the Extraordinary General Meeting. As of 16 April 2019, the Disposals have 

been completed and the Group has successfully disposed of its EWM line of business and the 

Company’s intended exit from the EWM was concluded. 

Further to the disposal, as of the date of this report, the Company has turned its focus on its 

trading business and this report excludes the E-waste line of business.

Supply-chain management 

 

 

 

Metech is a supplier and trader of gold and copper-related products, including both recycled 

copper as well as industry-graded copper cathodes. Leveraging expertise in the metal industry, 

Metech has gained wide acceptance among its industry peers and metal traders in the world. 

Gradually, we focused on our strength in the procurement of metal commodity and trades 

exchange-regulated metal products.  

 

Metech’s SCM encompasses the integrated planning and execution of processes required to 

efficiently optimize the flow of copper cathodes, information and financial capital which includes 

demand planning, sourcing, and inventory management. Due to efficacies of time and better 

management of our financial capital and resources, Metech reduces the need for transportation, 

storage warehousing and logistics by outsourcing to third parties [adopting agencies] to manage 

these aspects.

2.0 APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY 

 

 

2.1 Board statement 

 

 

2.1.1 Sustainability Strategy 

 

The Board is committed to uphold the highest standards of ethics and integrity while conducting 

its business activities. The Board believes that the sustainability report provides a reasonable and 

transparent presentation of the company’s sustainability strategies and of its environmental, social 

and governance (“ESG”) performances, including being agile in responding to changing 

circumstances while respecting the commitments in this report. The key ESG factors for the Group 

have been identified and reviewed by the management and monitoring of these factors as 

elaborated under clause 2.3 of this report and takes them into consideration when determining 

the Group’s strategic direction and policies. Sustainability is a part of the Group’s wider strategy 

to create long-term value for all its stakeholders. The Board endorses the material factors 

presented in this report. 

 

2.1.2 Sustainability Frameworks 

 

We report on our sustainability performance in accordance with the SGX Sustainability Reporting 

Guide, as well as guided by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core option. We also 

adopt, observe and monitor constantly many other policies, regulations and standards.  

 

2.1.3 Sustainability Governance 

 

Sustainability is a vital part of our corporate strategy for achieving long-term growth. The values 

we create for our people, the environment and society at large influences our financial 

performance. In order to accommodate our sustainability goals and values, we have developed a 

sustainability organisational structure.

2.2 Engaging Stakeholders: 

 

Under a clear mission that aims to respond to stakeholders’ needs and expectations properly and 

extensively, Metech divides stakeholders into four (4) groups, namely people, shareholders, 

clients, and communities, with responsible units to be established, manpower to be provided and 

duties to be assigned. Communication channels will be defined for them to work in agreement 

with the way each group of stakeholders operates. The responsible units will be required to 

regularly review the needs and expectations of their respective groups of stakeholders to ensure 

that responses from Metech are recognised as valuable and satisfactory.

Stakeholder engagement (SE) goals  

 

In the coming year, Metech aims to utilise more structured and detailed stakeholder engagement 

methods and implement proper documentation and data monitoring on the results. 

 

The Company acknowledges that stakeholder engagement forms an integral part of a good 

materiality assessment. Our SE goals include ensuring openness in dialogues, continuing to 

improve SE platforms such as investor relations website, staff/clients/supplier feedback portal, 

and accessibilities to email addresses to reach us. We recognise who our stakeholders are and 

target to have candid communication with them, rank and prioritise their concerns, all of which 

are critical in this age of corporate transparency and reporting. 

We continuously listen to and communicate with our stakeholders regularly, so that we can 

address their needs, build trust and create value.  Our SE goals focus on frequency, reachability 

and clarity to avoid any information asymmetry.  

 

2.3 Material ESG Factors – Policies, Practices, Performance and Targets 

 

We reviewed the material ESG factors against both the changing business landscape, and our 

key business developments to ensure that these are the issues relevant to us. We also 

determined the measurement methods and targets to be achieved by 2020 under the respective 

ESG factors, if any.  

 

In this report, we have identified and evaluated the following key ESG factors by way of 

prioritization. Key ESG factors: 

 

1. Procurement practices

3. ECONOMIC IMPACT 

 

Economic performance is vital importance to a company’s stakeholders particularly to investors 

or owners as the performance delivers a return on their investment. Other stakeholders, such as 

employees and the community also deem to benefit from such performance. As a Catalist listed 

company, we publish a detailed annual report comprising our corporate governance and financial 

performance. For detailed information, please refer to the financial statements in our Annual 

Report 2018. 

 

Material Environmental Issues, Context and Business case 

The following elements are Metech’s material economic issues: 

Procurement practices – management approach: 

In recent years, Metech expanded our SCM operations in China, where we generate substantial 

revenue. Upon establishing improved stability, we aim to expand Singapore relationships using 

the new expertise we gained from the expansion, and contribute to the economy.  

 

Metech’s geographical definition of ‘local’, refers specifically to Singapore. Traders with 

operations registered in Singapore and/or warehouses situated in Singapore. In FY2018, the SCM 

business have approximately 53% of our trades to local counterparts; an improvement from 42% 

in FY2017. 

 

Method/Action plan 

To address the material economic issues, we have adopted the following policies:

Metech only works with traders with London Metal 

Exchange (“LME”) registered products, with 

registered warehouses. Currently, most are 

foreign trading houses and suppliers. Metech 

takes a constant effort to validate the contracts it 

enters into and trades in only certified contracts 

which are listed on LME, which provides an added 

level of assurance as guided within the framework 

of LME.

4. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT 

While we contribute positively to the environment for in our core functions, we are also concerned 

with indirect impacts. 

 

Material Environmental Issues, Context and Business case 

The following elements are Metech’s material environmental issues: 

 

Emissions – while our core activities have a positive environmental effect, we remain 

vigilant of the overall emissions as the global greenhouse gas emissions are currently at 

unsustainable levels. We are also wary of the emissions from our non-core activities and 

third-party partners, and we aim to reduce our emissions in the areas of freight, usage of 

non-biodegradable products, and reduce energy and water usage. 

 

 

Supplier Environment Assessment – our core SCM functions do not result in significant 

direct environmental impacts, however we aim to reduce the indirect environmental 

impacts through the selection of our suppliers, such as our printers, paper supplies, and 

electricity vendor, etc. Through assessing our suppliers, we manage supply chain risks in 

terms of sustainability aspects, such as environment, human rights, financials, and etc. 

The traceability of supply chain is a collaboration between our stakeholders and Metech.   

 

Monitoring environmental impacts is a direct and fundamental part of our everyday business. 

Improvements in these areas, though seemingly insignificant to our business operations, we 

continue to remind our staff on some basic and socially responsible habits in their 

administrative office environment such as adopting greener work ethics, going paperless, 

switching off appliances if not in use, enabling power save modes, etc. and exceeding the 

regulatory requirements help conserve the Earth’s resources, mitigates climate change for the 

future generation and contributes to the long-term sustainability of not only our company but 

the world.

5. SOCIAL IMPACT 

 

The Group is also committed to carry out its social responsibility at the workplace for employees, 

and recognise that it is important to provide a safe and conducive working environment for 

employees. In addition, employees are employed under fair and equitable terms. Furthermore, 

employees are also given equal opportunities with regard to their career advancement.  

Employee information of the Group as at 30 June 2018: 

 

All employees are treated fairly, with respect and dignity, regardless of nationality, gender, age, 

race or religion. The hiring procedures are fair and non-discriminative, based on merit, experience, 

skills and/or competency to perform the job. The Group ensures compliance with labour and 

employment laws, including working hours. During their employment with the Company, 

employees are expected to uphold and ensure that they do not engage in any interest that is 

conflicted with any of the Company’s businesses. The code of work ethics is published in our 

Company’s Employee Handbook. 

 

Material Employment Issues, Context and Business case 

 

The following elements are Metech’s material social issues: 

 

 

Employment practices – management approach: Metech had developed an Employee 

Handbook (“Handbook”). The Handbook is reviewed and updated on an annual basis. The 

Handbook is based on our human resource policy which comprises of three key pillars: 

- Competitive Remuneration and Benefits; 

- Competent Workforce; and  

- Safe and Friendly workplace. 

 

 

Diversity and equal opportunity – management approach: Metech believes in fostering 

fairness, equity, and respect for social and cultural diversity, regardless of gender, age 

and educational background. For FY2018, employee diversity was not identified as a 

material social factor as we maintained a lean organizational structure during the reporting 

period which aligns with our intention to progressively scale down the EWM business.

Non-discrimination – management approach: Metech is committed to non-discrimination 

and equal opportunities even at the highest governance level. This is supported and 

communicated to our employees through the Handbook, which sets the tone of Metech’s 

stance against discrimination on any basis, including ethnicity, gender, religious beliefs, 

or age. 

 

Metech strongly believes that workplace satisfaction and productivity can be enhanced when 

individuals feel that they are part of an inclusive environment, where their contributions are 

recognised and valued, and where they feel supported and motivated to do their best. To that end, 

we value our employees and are committed to human resource policies that help us attract, retain 

and grow talent, in addition to building a conducive work environment.

6. GOVERNANCE AND REGULATORY  

 

The Group strives to comply with the best practices of good governance, guided by the 

Singapore’s Code of Corporate Governance 2012 (the “Code”), throughout its operations to 

safeguard the interests of all stakeholders. The Group recognises that good corporate 

governance processes are essential for enhancing corporate sustainability. Please refer to pages 

9 to 23 of our Annual Report 2018 on the details of the SGX Code of Corporate Governance.  

 

• Risk Management  

An integral part of good corporate governance, a comprehensive risk management framework 

enables the Group to identify and manage risks in a systematic and consistent manner. In driving 

risk awareness, decision-making and business processes are put through prudent risk 

assessment. Fraud, corruption and economic value-added risks have been identified as material 

to ensure business sustainability.  

 

• Whistle Blowing Policy  

The Whistle Blowing Policy adopted by the Board serves to provide an effective mechanism for 

employees and other stakeholders of the Group to raise concerns regarding any illegal conduct 

or malpractice. The policy also allows such concerns to be raised without being subject to 

victimization, harassment or discriminatory treatment, and ensures that such concerns are 

properly channelled to the right party for further investigation.  

 

• Dealings in Securities  

The Group’s code of conduct includes guidelines to directors and employees in the Group, which 

sets out prohibitions against dealings in the Company’s securities (i) while in possession of 

material unpublished price-sensitive information; and (ii) before the announcement of the 

Company's results. Prior to announcement of the Group’s results, an email would be sent out as 

reminder to all directors and employees of the Group to inform them of the duration of the period.
