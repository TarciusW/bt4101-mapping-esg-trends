Shared Economic Value 

Geo Energy understands that to achieve 

sustainability, we toned to provide what we can 

to all of our stakeholders including shareholders 

and communities where we operate. Regarding 

the creation of economic values for stakeholders, 

we paid dividends to our shareholders while 

paying taxes and fees to the government or local 

authorities. We also maximise the employment of 

local workers and suppliers as well as investing in 

community. We are committed to our employee 

and contractor’s welfare as we still pay bonuses 

for those who perform well.

“We are humbled 

by what we have 

accomplished over  

the past year and are 

aware that there is  

much more to do.  

We will continue on 

our CSR journey by 

empowering our local 

communities and  

reporting progress  

with determination  

to maximise benefits  

for all.”

As the world shifts towards new megatrends 

in the fields of sustainability within their 

business operations, many companies are 

confronted with significant environmental 

and social challenges. We view these 

challenges as opportunities for growth.

Geo Energy has undertaken great strides 

in overcoming these obstacles as we 

understand that if they are not effectively 

managed, they will affect our profitability, 

reputation and prospects for future business. 

At Geo Energy, we have created a 

management system that enables us to 

consistently foresee and address issues 

with an objective to prevent potential risks 

from becoming actual problems. Together 

we create value for long term shareholder, 

customers and employee by creating a 

strategy aimed towards the development 

of our environment, society, culture and 

economy. We faced a number of market 

challenges within our business in 2019 

including losses in revenue due to the 

reduction of coal price. 

However, we remained committed to 

our employees and contractors’ welfare 

maintaining benefits to all. In addition to 

this, we had invested US$0.4 million in 2019 

towards our community outreach programs 

and US$1m in 2020 to provide financial 

assistance to help the needy and medical aids 

and supplies in the prevention on the spread 

of COVID-19 in Indonesia and Singapore. We 

are committed to operating our business 

with corporate social responsibility concepts 

firmly embedded within our daily operations 

to protect our people, the environment, and 

the local communities in which we operate.

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted 

our business not only in Indonesia and 

Singapore but more broadly across our 

supply chain, with dire effects on human 

health and economies. Aligning with 

the World Health Organization (WHO) 

guidelines, a strategic objective of Geo 

Energy’s is to interrupt human-to-human 

transmission amongst our workforce to  

limit the spread of the virus. 

We had immediately implemented 

preventive measures, including 

implementing employees’ work rotation/

work from home arrangements, 

instigation of virtual meetings and 

self-isolation arrangements in addition 

to the socialisation of preventative 

actions. General self-care and hygiene 

campaigns have also been established, 

such as making hand sanitizers available 

at all of our offices and site locations and 

administration of personal temperature 

tests for both staff and visitors. We 

remain committed to these measures 

to help ensure the health and safety of 

all employees and contractors. We want 

to personally thank all our employees 

and partners who have committed to 

protecting all.

This year’s Sustainability Report outlines 

our work and achievements between 

January and December 2019. We have 

made key decision associated with our 

material issues including prioritizing 

biodiversity as a top tier focus area and 

mine rehabilitation with energy and 

climate change as a second tier issue 

along with employment practices.

SUMMARY

We are dedicated to strengthening our 

Good Corporate Governance (GCG) 

Principles and Framework and continue 

our focus in upholding ethical and 

integrity principles in our business 

and throughout all our operations. We 

provide internal and external channels 

for our stakeholders to raise business 

ethical concerns in a confidential manner 

through our whistleblowing policy and 

treat every misconduct with the upmost 

confidentiality involving a rigorous and 

investigation overseen by the Audit and 

Risk Committee (ARC). We understand that 

GCG is fundamental to our operations and 

underpins stakeholder and shareholder 

trust.  We are proud to report that we have 

zero confirmed case of corruption and 

bribery in 2019.

Respecting human rights assists in 

maintaining a positive relationship with  

our stakeholders, support a stable 

operating environment, improve the 

company’s reputation and build a 

sustainable business. 

Consequently, Geo Energy respects the 

human rights of all our employees and 

contract workers regardless of their 

working status, in line with international 

human rights conventions such as the 

International Labour Organisation  

(ILO) Conventions. 

We believe the key success of our company 

lies in our people. As such, we are fully 

committed to diversity and inclusion in our 

business and operations by providing equal 

opportunities for all roles of our company. 

Our company recruits and develops people 

on merit regardless of race, colour, religion, 

gender, ages and disability. In 2019, 

we employed a female-to-male ratio of 

approximately 1:3 across our operations.  

We had also provided training to all 

Singapore office employees and 96% of 

employees in Indonesia with a total of  

667 training hours. 

Since January 2019, we have undertaken 

a major review of our operations and 

governance, resulting in the development 

of an overarching Environment and Social 

Management System (ESMS) in accordance 

with International Finance Corporation  

(IFC) Performance Standards. The standards 

are a widely adopted international 

benchmark for identifying and managing 

environmental and social risk by many 

organizations as a key component of their 

environmental and social risk management. 

Currently, we are migrating to ISO 45001 to 

further strengthen our occupational health 

and safety (OH&amp;S) systems. In 2019, we are 

proud to report zero fatalities, work-related 

injuries or zero occupational illnesses during 

this reporting period.

In addition to this, we have implemented 

an integrated environmental management 

approach based on ISO 14001: 2015 on 

Environmental Management Systems 

(EMS). Our ISO 14001: 2015 certification 

illustrates our commitment in upholding  

the best international standards in EMS.  

We have had no case of environmental 

non-compliance in 2019.

In accordance to our social investment 

efforts, we have developed a Stakeholder 

Engagement Plan (SEP) that provides 

guidance for consultation and information 

disclosure with all our stakeholders. 

Following the SEP, we created a community 

program in 2019 focused on education and 

public infrastructure. We had successfully 

conducted a teacher development program 

and successfully supported infrastructure 

programs in Angsana and Bayansari village, 

which are close to our mining operations.

We are humbled by what we have 

accomplished over the past year and are 

aware that there is much more to do. We will 

continue on our CSR journey by empowering 

our local communities and reporting 

progress with determination to maximise

VISION AND MISSION



A B O U T  G E O  E N E R G Y



ORGANISATIONAL VISION,  

MISSION, AND VALUES

[GRI 102-16]

OUR VISION

To become one of Indonesia’s top ten coal 

producers by embarking on a series of 

acquisition opportunities.

Geo Energy commits to sustainable growth 

and enhancing shareholders value. We will 

continue to pursue opportunities to expand 

our mining operations and in growing our 

coal reserves through strategic acquisitions 

and vertical integration.

OUR MISSION

“Growing Up Together in Harmony” with 

all our stakeholders, including employees, 

offtakers, contractors, and communities.

We are committed to running our business 

with corporate social responsibility concepts 

firmly embedded within our daily operations 

to protect our people, the environment and 

the local communities in which we operate.

We review and analyse all of our business risks 

and opportunities, looking beyond economic, 

strategic and operational factors to include 

social and environmental considerations.

CORE VALUES

Accountable

We are responsible for our actions, our 

performance and our products in conducting 

our business, and we are committed to 

continuous improvements and learning.

Competence

We employ the best people, engage the top 

mining contractors and work with respected 

international traders.

Teamwork

We cooperate, communicate and support 

each other in achieving our vision and 

mission in this competitive environment.

Responsive

We strive to achieve the best possible 

outcome in everything we do, for the benefit 

of our people, our business partners and our 

communities.

OUR BUSINESS PORTFOLIO

[GRI 102-1, 102-2, 102-3, 102-6]

Starting the business as primarily a coal 

mining services provider in 2008, Geo Energy 

Resources Limited (collectively with its 

subsidiaries ‘Geo Energy’ or the ‘Group’) has 

transformed to be one of Indonesia’s leading 

coal producers. This transition has allowed us 

to change the business model from operating 

as a relatively small-scale mining services 

provider in an environment of high capital 

expenditure and relatively low operational 

efficiency, with high dependence on 

owners of coal mining concessions, to 

being a low-cost coal producer with high-

quality coal mining assets. Our corporate 

offices are based in Singapore and Jakarta 

while our mining operations are in 

Kalimantan, Indonesia. In 2012, Geo Energy 

was listed on the Mainboard of SGX under 

the stock code: RE4 and is part of the 

Singapore FTSE-ST Index.

“Geo Energy commits to 

sustainable growth and 

enhancing shareholders 

value. We will continue 

to pursue opportunities 

to expand our mining 

operations and in growing 

our coal reserves through 

strategic acquisitions and 

vertical integration.”

Singapore FTSE-ST Index. The Group was 

ranked 17th in the inaugural awards for 

Singapore’s Fastest Growing Companies

investment in Geo Energy.

OUR OPERATIONS

[GRI 102-4, 102-7]

The Group has four mining concessions 

located in South and East Kalimantan. 

Currently, the Group is actively operating 

two mines: SDJ and TBR, with TBR site 

increasing its operational production 

this year. The Group has re-commenced 

the mining operations at BEK but not yet 

activated STT.

The focus of the Group’s coal sales remains 

in Indonesia and China as core markets. 

Geo Energy has also scaled up its presence 

in other markets such as South Korea, 

Thailand, India and Philippines. The total 

coal sales in 2019 was 7.4 million tonnes, 

which is 4% higher than previous year.

SUSTAINABILITY

A P P R O A C H  T O  S U S T A I N A B I I T Y

Driving and deriving value through better 

environmental and social responses has 

been part of Geo Energy’s DNA since 

the founding of our Group. This 2019 

Sustainability Report marks our three-

year journey of integrating social and 

environmental considerations into our 

business strategy, culture, operations,  

and decision-making processes. As a 

resource-based company, we are fully 

aware of our impacts to society and 

environment. At any time, we assess the 

risks and impacts of associated activities 

in our operations. We always try to 

prevent, reduce and mitigate risks as 

much as possible through our internal 

Environmental, Social, and Governance 

(ESG) risk assessment.

SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY  

AND MANAGEMENT

[GRI 102-18]

Our business strategy is to create innovative 

products, meet shareholder expectations, 

and operate in a socially and environmentally 

responsible manner. 

 

Our Sustainability Framework comprises an 

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Working 

Group that identifies the sustainability of 

opportunities and risks across our operations 

enabling us to deliver tailored solutions to 

help us realize our objectives.

We work collaboratively with stakeholders 

to ensure that we keep channels of 

communication open and talk about issue that 

are important to our stakeholders.  

To ensure the sustainability of our business, 

we recognise that communicating with 

our stakeholders is imperative. We ensure 

continual communication with regulators and 

investors, which is central to our ambition to 

be our industry’s trusted partner.



Improving our ESG, our targets, and our 

commitments towards the community have 

always been a priority in our business. In 

2020, we continue to maintain and improve 

the implementation of the ESMS by working 

collaboratively with BUMA to ensure that 

all environmental, health and safety risks 

are managed well for the entire group. We 

also aim to improve our health and safety 

performance through the migration from 

OHSAS 18001 to ISO 45001 for our mining 

contractors and aiming for the certification by 

ISO 45001 in 2020. We are working with our 

consultant to assess on how we can improve 

our current strategies and targets as well as to 

determine new appropriate targets for each 

identified ESG factor. We should be disclosing 

this in our next sustainability report.

OUR MATERIALITY

[GRI 102-42, 102-47]

We undertook our first materiality 

assessment in 2017 and mapped out 

key ESG issues that are important to our 

stakeholders and Geo Energy.  

Since then, we have reported our material 

issues based on the GRI Standards2 and 

followed the AccountAbility (AA) 1000’s 

recommended guidelines3.

We first identified the sustainability material 

issues relevant to our industry and stakeholders 

affected by our business. We then defined and 

engaged these issues to relevant stakeholder 

groups through direct interviews. Criteria 

were set out to gauge the priorities of how 

each group perceive the importance for 

each material issue. The consultation was 

then scored based on the issue’s impact on 

business success (internal) or importance 

to external stakeholders. The result of the 

stakeholder engagement were then processed

to review and validate the relevance of 

our materiality issues. Each material issue 

was benchmarked against industry peers in 

Indonesia and the Dow Jones Sustainability 

Index (DJSI) Gold Award. The study informed 

us that our identified material issues are still 

relevant to our business today, however, 

there have been minor changes in how we 

categorise our material issues, and these 

changes include:

• Increasing the significance of 

Biodiversity to Top Tier, which includes 

mine rehabilitation

• Changing material issue name of Energy 

Efficiency and Climate Change into Energy

as a Second-Tier material issue

• Merging Employment, Labour

MANAGEMENT APPROACH  

AND COMMITMENT

[GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

At Geo Energy, we are committed to protect 

our stakeholders’ interests and create long-

term sustainable value. At the corporate 

level, we implement best practice standards 

in Good Corporate Governance (GCG) to 

safeguard our commitment in transparency 

and accountability. We strongly believe 

that our approach and commitment will 

create long-term value to our business and 

stakeholders’ sustainability.

GCG PRINCIPLES AND 

FRAMEWORK

[GRI 102-18, 102-20]

Our corporate governance principles 

and framework are aimed at ensuring 

accountability and transparency throughout 

our business operation. We believe it will 

foster long-term value and sustainable 

growth for the benefit of our partners.

We constantly review and evaluate our 

corporate governance in accordance with 

applicable national regulations. We adhere 

to Singapore regulations as set by the 

Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), 

applicable Indonesian Mining Regulation, 

and the SGX-ST requirements.

The Principles and Practice Guidance set 

forth in the Code of Corporate Governance 

2018 (the Code5) established by SGX-ST 

serves as a guidance to our corporate 

governance framework. As detailed in the 

Code, our Board of Directors (the Board) 

has the dual role of setting our strategic 

direction and setting the company’s 

approach to governance. This includes 

establishing an appropriate culture, values 

and ethical standards of conduct at all levels 

of the company. 

For the financial year ending 31 December 

2019, Geo Energy adhered to the 

principles and guidelines as set out in 

the Code. Beginning in January 2019, 

we undertook major review of our 

operations and governance, resulting 

in the development of an overarching 

Environment and Social Management 

System (ESMS) in accordance with the 

International Finance Corporation (IFC) 

Performance Standards6.

The ESMS states the Group’s commitment 

to environmental and social management. 

It elaborated procedures for identifying, 

assessing and managing our environmental 

and social risk7. Our Head of Technical and 

Engineering led implementation of the 

ESMS across our operation.

ETHICS AND INTEGRITY

[GRI 102-16, 205-3, 206-1]

Upholding ethical and integrity principles in 

our business and throughout our operation 

is fundamental to how we operate and 

underpins stakeholder’s and shareholder’s 

trust. The Code 2018 Principles and Practice 

Guidance guides the ethics and integrity 

principles. Our Board is ultimately accountable 

for the implementation while fully supported 

by our Audit and Risk Committee.

Our Code of Ethics and Conduct sets out 

the principles and expected standards 

for our day-to-day actions, decisions, 

and interactions. Our focus in upholding 

business integrity is enforcement of zero 

tolerance of fraud, bribery, and corruption. 

Regardless of positions, all employees face 

prompt disciplinary action or termination 

should they breach our strong stance in 

anti-corruption and bribery policy.

We are proud to report that we have zero 

confirmed cases of corruption and bribery  

in 2019.

“The Board has put in 

place a Code of Conduct 

and ethics, values and 

desired organisation 

culture, and ensured 

proper Accountability 

with the Group.”

The Code of Corporate Governance (the 

"Code") is applicable to listed companies in 

Singapore on a comply-or-explain basis. It aims 

to promote high levels of corporate governance 

in Singapore by putting forth Principles of good 

corporate governance and Provisions with which 

companies are expected to comply.

 

The Practice Guidance complements the Code 

by providing guidance on the application of 

the Principles and Provisions and setting out 

best practices for companies. Adoption of the 

Practice Guidance is voluntary.

The International Finance Corporation 

Performance Standards (IFC PS) is a widely 

adopted international benchmark for 

identifying and managing environmental and 

social risk by many organizations as a key 

component of their environmental and social 

risk management.

 

It aimed to providing guidance on how to 

identify risks and impacts, and designed to help 

avoid, mitigate, and manage risks and impacts 

as a way of doing business in a sustainable 

way, including stakeholder engagement and 

disclosure obligations of the client in relation 

to project-level activities.

RISK MANAGEMENT

WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY

[GRI 102-16, 102-17]

Our whistleblowing policy aims to provide 

a confidential channel for employees and 

external parties, to raise concerns of business 

ethics and non-compliance. We protect 

the whistle-blowers’ confidentiality and 

anonymity with the utmost care.

Our Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) reviews 

significant reports to ensure adequate and 

timely investigation and resolution. This 

mechanism ensures that we continually 

maintain our business ethics and integrity, 

while protecting our employees. Our ARC 

received zero whistleblowing reports during 

this reporting period.

RISK MANAGEMENT

[GRI 102-11, 102-30]

We implement a clear and robust Enterprise 

Risk Management (ERM) Framework to 

safeguard the company against risks.  

As a mining company, we are involved in 

high risk operations at our mining sites. This 

risk framework helps us to understand and 

minimise risks and non-compliance with 

applicable laws and regulations.

Our ERM Working Group, in consultation 

with the Company’s ERM consultant, KPMG 

Services Pte. Ltd., review all significant 

control policies and procedures on an 

ongoing basis and highlights all significant 

matters, findings and recommendation to 

the Board and the ARC.

We conduct rigorous cyclical risk 

identification and assessments along with 

monitoring and reporting across all aspects 

of our operations:

• At the operational level, key management 

personnel of the respective business units 

– the risk owners, together with the ERM 

Working Group – identify potential risks 

through conducting.

• An annual risk workshop and prioritising 

the top risks affecting the Group as well  

as to provide countermeasures for the risks 

identified. All identified risks are assessed,

• Each prioritised risk is then assigned to its 

respective Risk Owner who is responsible 

for monitoring, controlling, and reporting 

on the status and effectiveness of each risk 

response action to the ERM Working Group.

• The identified top risks will be presented 

to the Board for review and approval on the 

adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s  

risk management and internal control.

HUMAN RIGHTS

[GRI 412-1, 412-3]

Geo Energy respects the human rights 

of our employees and contract workers 

regardless of their working status, in line 

with international human rights conventions 

such as the International Labour Organisation 

(ILO) Conventions.

We are working towards improving the 

human rights aspects of our operations. 

During the 2019 reporting period, there were 

no significant investment agreements and 

contracts that included human rights clauses 

or that underwent human rights screening.

PROCUREMENT PRACTICES

[GRI 204-1]

We have established robust processes 

and policies and governance structure in 

our procurement practices. Our aim is to 

provide clear guidance on all purchasing 

activities whilst also serving as effective 

safeguard against all forms of unethical 

behaviours. We believe having well 

developed procurement policies will also 

foster conducive financial conditions that 

support local communities to improve 

their standard of living. In 2019, TBR (3%) 

and SDJ (89.7%) sourced most of their site 

products locally from vendors located in 

South Kalimantan Province.

Our procurement policies include:

• Criteria and processes for purchases and 

payables;

• Selection and annual evaluation of vendors; 

and

• Local Recruitment and Procurement Plan.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH  

AND COMMITMENT

[GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 406-1]

At Geo Energy, we believe the key success 

of our Group is our people. We strive to 

engage and develop our people by offering 

them career progression opportunities 

and competitive compensation on top of 

protecting their health and safety. Our focus 

is to recruit and retain diverse talents who 

can support our vision, mission, and values. 

We are fully committed to diversity and 

inclusion in our business and operations by 

providing equal opportunities for all roles 

in our company. Our Group recruits and 

develops people regardless of race, colour, 

religion, gender, age, and disability.

We are committed to comply with all 

applicable labour laws and regulations 

and we aim to go beyond this by 

providing the best services to our 

people. Although mining operators are 

not within our boundary8, we make 

sure that all our procedures in labour 

relations and human resources are 

aligned with best practice standards 

and applicable regulations. Our human 

resource policy and procedures ensure 

that our employees’ rights are protected 

regardless of their background.

OUR PEOPLE AT A GLANCE

[GRI 102-8, 405-1, 406-1]

During this period, we saw an adverse 

disruption in the coal market and it affected 

our human resources operation. However, 

we managed to prioritise the wellbeing of 

our employees and frontline workers.

In 2019, 169 out of 188 employees 

were based in Indonesia, where our 

mining operations are located, with 19 

employees were based in our Singapore 

office. Most of our Indonesian employees 

are in non-executive positions at 66% of 

total employees. Furthermore, we have 

talented young individuals working for our 

Indonesian operations with 33% aged less 

than 30 years old.

We are pleased to achieve an equal 

gender ratio in our Singapore office. In 

total, we employed a female-to-male ratio 

of 1:3 in our operations. The nature of 

our business operations meant that we 

have more male employee candidates 

than female. For instance, our mining 

operations in Indonesia have 128 males 

and 41 females. However, we recognised 

that we can do more to contribute 

to women in Science, Technology, 

Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).

HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT

[GRI 404-3, 404-1]

The development of our employees is 

fundamental to our business sustainability. 

It is very critical that we provide training 

and education for our employees to 

maintain and grow the best talent. All of 

our employees receive equal opportunities 

in receiving professional development and 

career progression. Supervisors conduct 

performance reviews for employees to 

acknowledge and encourage development 

and discuss valuable feedback in achieving 

work-related goals. We tailor the training 

and education of our employees based on 

their roles and responsibilities to enable 

them to make the greatest contribution to 

the Group.

In 2019, we have provided training to 

all our employees in Singapore office 

and Indonesia office, with a total of 667 

training hours. This was an increase of 

approximately 39% from the previous 

year. Attendees comprised 49% of senior 

executives, 40% of executives, and 11% 

of non-executives. Training programs 

implemented in 2019 were varied, 

including:

• The 4th Indonesian Coal Outlook 

Conference 2019 organised by 

Petromindo.com. Such conference 

highlighted the latest Domestic Market 

Obligation as well as released the prospect 

of the Indonesian Coal Industry covering 

policy, investment, and regulatory 

reviews. Our employees were able to gain 

insights of the latest government policies, 

benefiting to the Group’s business.

• Software SPRY Scheduler Training. This 

was a modelling training that represents 

the actual condition of the Group’s 

operations focusing on production and 

quality. This has helped our scheduling and 

planning activities to be more efficient.

• Seminar on the Direction and Strategy 

for 2019 Tax Law Enforcement Policies 

and includes the agenda of Improving the 

Compliance by Taxpayer. This Seminar 

was held by the Indonesian Accounting 

Association. For any changes in Tax Law, 

all companies are required to comply 

with the latest or revised government 

policy. We will align the Group’s

MANAGEMENT APPROACH  

AND COMMITMENT

[GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 403-1]

Geo Energy believes that the health and 

safety of our employees, contractors, 

and communities where we operate 

are essential to our business. It is our 

responsibility to ensure that the working 

place are in safe condition. Everyone is 

encouraged to implement safety behaviours 

to minimize risk of accidents, injuries and 

occupational illnesses. To achieve this goal, 

we have established Occupational Safety, 

Health and Environment (OHSE) Policy for 

all our mine operations. Our policy is a 

guideline that outline our commitment to 

protect our employees, contractors, and 

communities and to comply with applicable 

legislations.

HEALTH AND SAFETY 

COMPLIANCE

[GRI 403-1]

As a good corporate citizen, we adhere 

to national laws related to health and 

safety as the minimum requirement to 

protect our employees. Our health and 

safety management programs are based 

on applicable local laws and regulations. 

On top of this, we also follow international 

best practice frameworks such as OHSAS 

18000 as well as various international and 

financing standards that are applicable 

to us. We are in the middle of migrating 

to another international best practice 

standards in occupational health and 

safety (OH&amp;S), the ISO 45001. The new 

management system would ensure that 

our people are protected.

HEALTH AND SAFETY 

MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

[GRI 102-12, 403-2, 403-3, 403-7]

In 2019, we established an Environmental, 

Health and Safety, and Social Management 

System (EHS&amp;SMS), which sets out the 

identification and evaluation of risks, hazards 

and impacts; and the controls and mitigation 

measures required.

H E A L T H  A N D  S A F E T Y

ZERO FATALITIES



Our EHS&amp;SMS sets out the health and 

safety management plans, procedures, 

and a provision on monitoring reviews. 

We developed the EHS&amp;SMS based 

on relevant national regulations, 

international financing standards such as 

the International Finance Corporations 

(IFC) Performance Standard (PS) and 

international standards for management 

systems: OHSAS 18001:2007 (Occupational 

Health and Safety Assessment Series).

As part of the EHS&amp;SMS implementation, 

we also commit to conduct monitoring 

and review process to maintain our 

continual improvement, performance 

and effectiveness management system in 

accordance with the Plan-Do-Check-Act 

(PDCA) model.

CONTRACTOR HEALTH, SAFETY, 

AND ENVIRONMENT  

MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

[GRI 403-2, 403-3, 403-4]

As our partner and mining operator, BUMA 

works together with us on our employees’ 

safety. Contractor management system 

plays an important role given the number 

of employees working at our mining sites, 

which is around 3,000 workers.

 

To support this, we have developed the 

Contractor HSE Evaluation Policy (2018),  

a framework that enables us to effectively 

supervise, monitor, oversee and manage our 

contractor selection appointment process, 

and to evaluate the existing contractors 

appointed in terms of HSE requirements.

 

Apart from our Contractor HSE Evaluation 

Policy, BUMA itself has developed robust 

policies and programs that strengths our 

health and safety management system such 

as JOSHE (Joint Observation Safety Health 

and Environment), ZIAP (Zero Incident 

Awareness Programme), and a daily five-

minute safety meeting before the start of 

operations (P5M).

OPERATIONAL HEALTH AND 

SAFETY PERFORMANCE

[GRI 403-9, 403-10]

Monitoring our health and safety 

performance is a key factor to ensure that 

our health and safety programs are well 

implemented. In 2019, we are grateful to 

achieve zero fatalities and work-related 

injuries from about 2 million hours in SDJ 

mine and 4 million hours in TBR mine.  

We are also proud that we had no 

occupational illness occurred during this 

reporting period.

We have successfully improved our health 

and safety performance from last year. 

In 2018, we regretfully had three people 

experiencing work-related injuries in our 

SDJ mine. We took the evaluation of our 

health and safety system seriously and 

successfully achieved zero fatalities and 

work-related injuries in 2019. Through our 

high commitment and health and safety 

programs, we successfully maintained our 

zero fatalities and work-related injuries 

from 2017 to 2019 in our TBR mine.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH &amp;  

SAFETY PROGRAMS

[GRI 403-5, 403-6]

Our health and safety programs are 

established to increase not only 

awareness but also the safety culture 

of our operations. Excellent teamwork 

is necessary to achieve our health and 

safety objectives. The programs aim to 

prevent accidents by minimizing the 

occurrence of unsafe conditions and 

unsafe actions, which are a direct cause 

of an accident’s occurrence.

INTERNAL SAFETY TRAINING

To enhance the safety culture within our 

mining areas, we often organise internal 

safety trainings such as basic occupational 

health and safety, housekeeping, fire 

prevention, first aid, working at height, 

and working near water, etc. This internal 

training is carried out based on Training 

Need Analysis according to each worker’s 

position and exposure to potential 

hazards. The schedules will be made 

for implementation and monitoring of 



competency fulfilment for each worker.  

A minimum pass test score of 80 is made  

to ensure the understanding of the  

training participants.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH  

AND HYGIENE PROGRAM

Our health team consists of an 

occupational doctor and two medical 

support staff. Our achievement on zero 

occupational illness are as a result of our 

efforts through various occupational health 

and hygiene programs, including:

• Employee Health Checks. This is to 

ensure that our employees’ health 

status meets the job requirements and 

any potential exposure to the hazards. 

A special health check for hazardous, 

toxic waste and food handler workers are 

performed in every six months. Health 

check-ups are conducted by our site 

doctors and the results will be followed-

up by respective workers.

• Hygiene and Sanitation Management. 

This is to monitor the compliance of the 

standards of area and the supply of food 

and beverage, provided by the Group, for 

workers' consumption. Such monitoring 

is to ensure that there is no potential for 

fatal conditions such as food poisoning. 

Such efforts include inspections on the 

condition and housekeeping of the kitchen 

and canteen, and the cleanliness of worker’s 

accommodation.

CASE STUDY – JOSHE  

(JOINT OBSERVATION SAFETY  

HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT)

Our achievement on safety performance 

cannot be separated from the teamwork 

with BUMA, our contractor in both SDJ 

and TBR mining areas. We measure the 

implementation of the program regularly 

to improve the program’s effectiveness. 

Safety patrols are undertaken daily by 

our safety team (Geo Energy and BUMA) 

to check the mining environment and 

workers, for example, inspections on work 

attributes, speed limits, and inspection on 

compliance of safety signs.

Aside from the safety patrol, there are 

also regular inspections conducted by 

field supervisors to ensure that the work 

area is safe. Our team will check the 

safety of working areas, namely pits or 

front, disposal, workshop, hazardous and 

toxic waste storage, and warehouses.

We also have a safety rewards 

program held on a monthly basis to 

incentivise employees that actively 

participate in implementing positive 

safety behaviours such as observing 

hazards or closing out outstanding 

safety concerns within the mine area. 

As part of our safety rewards program, 

all employees participate in a weekly 

and monthly safety talk program. This 

program has broadened the insight of 

all employees into the importance of 

health, safety, work and environmental 

concerns and helped to achieve greater 

engagement of all employees with safe 

work procedures and our HSE rules.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH  

AND COMMITMENT

[GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

Mirroring our strong commitment to 

stakeholder in creating long-term sustainable 

value, we are highly committed to creating a 

positive and lasting impact to the community 

where we operate. We believe that 

strong relationships are built on trust and 

respect, as such obtaining and maintaining 

community support and social license to 

operate is key for our continued success. 

Proactive approach toward community needs 

is always our focus in running our business.

We strive to implement our Stakeholder 

Engagement Policy in all our operational 

area. In line with building and maintaining a 

constructive relationship with stakeholders, 

we have developed a Stakeholder 

Engagement Plan (SEP) that provides 

guidance for consultation and information 

disclosure with all our stakeholders.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

[GRI 102-12, 102-40, 102-42, 102-43, 102-

44, 203-2, 413-1, 414-2]

Our stakeholder engagement process 

is initiated by identifying and mapping 

relevant parties to form the foundation of 

our plans and strategies for engagement 

activities. We utilise various tools to 

engage with our stakeholders such as 

websites, presentations, and interviews.

The process extends from information sharing 

and consultation, to participation, negotiation, 

and information of partnerships. This two-way 

approach means that stakeholders can provide 

feedbacks through our communication 

channels to ensure that feedbacks are 

recorded and handled as required.

As part of our Stakeholder Engagement 

Policy, we have developed a grievance 

mechanism process for affected stakeholder 

to raise their concerns associated with our 

operations. This process is designed to 

provide effective engagement and disclosure 

program. As such, we regularly monitor our 

grievance redress to identify and pinpoint 

areas of improvement to better engage and 

support our affected stakeholders.

In 2019, we identified rooms for improvement 

in our stakeholder management approach. 

As such, we employed PT ERM Indonesia to 

support us in developing our international 

best practices standards based on the 

International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) 

Performance Standard. With their support, 

we are excited and motivated to implement 

our refreshed approach in better engaging our 

communities.

SUPPORTING COMMUNITY 

LIVELIHOODS

[GRI 203-1, 413-2]

In all our community activities, we strive 

to integrate community involvement in our 

operation area. We support community 

development through programs of 

employment, business opportunities, training 

and capacity building. It is within our effort 

to improve the livelihoods and raise the living 

standards of the local communities.

Our local corporate social responsibility 

(CSR) teams frequently engage with village 

heads, local government authorities and 

agencies to understand their problems 

and what can the Group do to assist in a 

collaborative manner. Regular meetings are 

held with representatives from surrounding 

villages to discuss the progress and 

implementation of our community assistance 

plans as well as to address any issues, 

concerns or complaints that may have arisen 

and to discuss best practical activities of CSR 

program implementation. This approach 

enables all parties the opportunity to 

exchange views and information.

We engage and support local communities 

through beneficial social investment 

programmes. Our methodologically approach 

for the programmes is by conducting Social 

Mapping to every operation that are in line 

with the Musyawarah Rencana Pembangunan 

/ Deliberation on Development Plans in 

the area. It is our pleasure to support the 

needs of the villages, where we provided 

USD400,000 to contribute to the welfare of 

the communities in the seven villages located 

around our mining operations.

Education

We believe education is the foundation of 

sustainable development for community 

wellbeing. Our operations support the local 

communities through education initiatives 

such as teacher development program and 

improving educational infrastructure. Many 

of our programs focuses on early childhood 

education to develop the younger generation 

and contribute to a sustainable future.

1,000 Outstanding Teachers Program

Geo Energy, in collaboration with Surya 

Institute Foundation, supported the Tanah 

Bumbu District Education Department 

Program for the selected “1,000 Outstanding 

Teachers”. By investing IDR 625,000,000 to 

the program, we facilitated teacher training 

to increase the teacher’s competency and 

equipped them to prepare students to 

participate in the national and international 

Olympics. From this program, we are proud to 

receive an award from the Regent of  Tanah 

Bumbu.

Classrooms

Early childhood education is the 

cornerstone of developing the younger 

generation. The educational infrastructure 

plays a role to influence fluency, comfort, 

safety as well as the success of teaching 

and learning activities. We have built 

classrooms for early childhood education 

to increase interest in learning for children. 

This has also supported an increase in the 

number of student admission from the 

increased classroom capacity.

Tahfidz

The community surrounding our operations 

area consider religion as an important aspect 

of life, where the majority believe in Islam. 

Aligning with the local government initiative 

of “1 Village 1 Tahfidz House”, we support 

this initiative by constructing a tahfidz house 

for the community. Knowing the importance 

of religion in the community, we hope the 

program can enhance their quality of life and 

community wellbeing.

Public Infrastructure

The largely rural population near our 

operation areas means that we can further 

improve their livelihoods and the local 

economy. We support public infrastructure 

development to increase the communities’ 

quality of life and prosperity. We enhance 

community wellbeing by investing in the local 

public infrastructure as followed.

Road

We managed to enhance local public 

infrastructure by improving the access 

road in the villages surrounding our 

operation area.

Pier

Angsana Village is a potential location for local 

economy development with Angsana Beach 

near the location. The area has several tourist 

facilities that support the local economy. 

Through local public consultation, we identified 

opportunities to improve the community's 

economy by facilitating access for fishing 

boats and passenger ships to the tourist sites.

Batam Build

Batam Build is a series of short-term trips 

designed to provide an opportunity for 

participants who are keen to volunteer on 

a build trip but are unable to travel for long 

periods of time with the aims to improve 

the standard of living for 1,000 families 

through the reconstruction of new homes, 

improving the current water, drainage 

and electricity system. We, together with 

Habitat of Humanity Singapore, joined the 

current stage of houses construction that 

was assigned to us such as the early phase 

of laying the foundation. Our aim is to 

improve the standard of living for families 

through the reconstruction of new homes.



Run for Hope 2019

Run for Hope (“RFH”) is an annual run 

organised by Four Seasons Hotel Singapore 

and the National Cancer Centre Singapore 

(“NCCS”) to raise much-needed awareness 

and support for cancer research. This is the 

2nd year of our sponsorship and donation. 

We will continue to support and commit 

further resources as we believe in creating 

sustainable value through good ESG practices 

and corporate governance.

Donations for COVID-19

Amid the unprecedented COVID-19 global 

pandemic, we have donated S$10,000 to 

the Singapore Institute Technology (SIT) as 

part of their fund raising program - Student 

Relief Fund @ SIT (COVID-19). This allow 

SIT to provide some urgent relief to at 

least 250 undergraduates impacted by 

the pandemic, with a grant quantum of 

up to $2,000 per student. These are the 

students who come from families that are 

more vulnerable to the effects of economic 

fluctuations.

To help the needy and support the fight 

against COVID-19, we have donated IDR1 

billion to the Dompet Kemanusian Media 

Group (DKMG), Indonesia. This donation will 

be used to support the supply of Personal 

Protective Equipment to help protect front 

line health care workers at the hospitals 

and clinics. We are also contributing IDR0.5 

billion in our CSR projects to provide and 

distribute financial assistance and medical 

aids to the communities at our mine sites in 

South Kalimantan.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH AND 

COMMITMENT

[GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 307-1, 308-1]

At Geo Energy, we are committed to 

minimising environmental risks and 

upholding high environmental standards 

wherever we operate. We always seek 

to manage our environmental footprints 

by employing robust environmental 

management practices. As a resource-

based company, we realise that we create 

considerable environmental impacts and  

that it is imperative for us to carefully 

manage these impacts.

The complexity of environmental issues 

mean that we have to implement integrated 

environmental management approach 

- from water and waste management to 

land rehabilitation. We always focus on 

avoiding and preventing negative impacts. 

Where negative environmental impacts are 

unavoidable, we maximise our efforts in 

mitigating and remediating environmental 

impacts. We take environmental 

stewardship seriously to maintain good 

stakeholder relationships.

ENVIRONMENTAL  

MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

[GRI 102-12, 307-1, 308-1]

Wherever we operate, we always strive to 

comply with the applicable environmental 

law and regulations. In order to effectively 

manage and comply with all environmental 

requirements, we have implemented an 

integrated environmental management 

approach based on ISO 14001: 2015 on 

Environmental Management Systems (EMS). 

Our ISO 14001: 2015 certification shows 

our commitment in upholding the best 

international standards in EMS.

In 2019, we underwent an Environmental 

and Social Due Diligence to develop an 

overarching Environmental and Social 

Management System (ESMS) across all our 

assets. Based on this, we are trying to align 

our environmental management approach 

to other international best practice 

standards such as the Equator Principles III 

and the International Finance Corporations 

(IFC) Performance Standards. Looking 

forward, we are excited to implement these 

results and further improve our future 

environmental performance for a more 

sustainable business.

We are proud to say that we have zero cases 

of non-compliance with environmental laws 

and regulations in 2019 and will always be 

committed to uphold this in all our assets.

wherever we operate. We always seek to 

manage our environment.

LAND RECLAMATION AND 

REHABILITATION

[GRI 304-1, 304-3]

We believe that a strategic approach 

to post-mining reclamation is the 

cornerstone to good environmental 

management in our industry. Our coal 

reserves are located underneath a 

previous palm oil plantation where we 

have agreed with the landowner to 

borrow, use, and return the land once 

mining activities are completed. This 

means that each time we initiate mining 

activities, we excavate and store the 

topsoil for land reclamation purposes. 

We are fortunate that due to previous 

land use activities, the impacts of our 

operations to local biodiversity are kept 

at a minimum.

Together with BUMA, we employ industry 

standard approach in land reclamation by 

preserving materials above the coal seam or 

ore body. Once mining activity is completed, 

we return the preserved materials and 

rehabilitate the landscape by spreading 

topsoil and cover crop to improve soil 

quality and reduce soil erosion.

In 2019, we have started our land 

reclamation process in TBR. Together with 

SDJ, we have completed 95 ha of reclaimed 

land. This is an increase of 48% of total land 

reclaimed from previous year. As part of 

our land reclamation plan, we proactively 

reclaim and rehabilitate land once an 

operation in particular area has finished. 

In this way, we minimise and mitigate our 

impacts swiftly.

CLIMATE CHANGE

ENERGY AND  

CLIMATE CHANGE

At Geo Energy, we recognise that our 

business is energy intensive and emit 

greenhouse gas (GHG). We are always 

committed to manage these impacts 

through best practice EMS approach and 

take appropriate operational initiatives 

where possible. As such, our focus is to 

always minimise these impacts through 

best practice approach and complying with 

applicable environmental regulations.

Additionally, our coal is characterised 

as low ash, low sulphur and low energy, 

which is increasingly in demand as higher 

environmental concern promotes the need for 

high quality, low sulphur and low ash coals. 

It provides excellent economic and technical 

benefits as the low-pollutant content allows us 

to meet the stringent emission standards and 

comply with environmental regulations.

ENERGY PERFORMANCE

[GRI 302-1, 302-3]

We always monitor our energy consumption, 

which includes fuel sources used to power our 

mobile and operational equipment. We also 

regularly monitor our electricity consumption 

and fuel gas used for our supporting facilities. 

Our operations employ energy efficiency 

measures such as reducing lighting and air 

conditioner usage when not in used and 

utilising energy efficient equipment for our 

supporting facilities. We also conduct yearly 

campaigns to improve awareness to conserve 

energy consumption by reducing fuel 

consumption use for our mobile equipment.

In 2019, we saw a decrease for both of our 

total energy11 consumption and intensity at 

our operations by 26% and 25% respectively. 

The decrease of total energy consumption 

can be attributed to our non-renewable 

fuel use reduction in our SDJ site by more

than 50%, which accounted for almost 

100% of our energy consumption at the 

site. Although there is an increase of 20% 

energy consumption at our TBR site, we have 

managed to decrease the energy intensity at 

both of our sites.

GHG EMISSIONS PERFORMANCE

[GRI 305-1, 305-2, 305-4]

We calculate our scope 1 emissions based 

on our diesel-fuel consumption and the 

small amount of fuel gas used in our 

supporting facilities. Whereas scope 2 

emissions are calculated based on the 

electricity purchased from the national 

grid for our site offices. Emission factors of 

all sources are considered based on best 

measurement practice12.

In 2019, we reduced our total scope 1 

emissions and scope 1 emissions intensity 

by 26% and 19% respectively. This translated 

to a total reduction of 35,110 tCO2eq direct 

emissions from our operations. The main 

contributor for our scope 1 emissions is our 

diesel-fuel and fuel gas consumption, which 

reflects significantly in our energy performance.

In our scope 2 performance, we observed 

an increase of 5% and 23% respectively for 

our total emissions and emissions intensity. 

This increase can be attributed to the 

intensifying operational activities at our 

TBR office sites, which accounts for 60% of 

our total electricity grid consumption. We 

will continue our efforts in reducing our 

electricity consumptions by implementing 

more energy efficient equipment at our 

site offices.

WATER AND EFFLUENT

[GRI 303-1, 303-2, 303-3, 303-4, 303-5, 

306-1]

Our operations employ water and 

wastewater management based on best 

management standards and applicable 

water quality regulations. Measuring, 

monitoring, and evaluating water quality 

is a part of our standard procedures to 

ensure that every wastewater discharge 

complies with applicable water quality 

standards. All our operations source its 

water from municipal suppliers and a 

wellbore in our operation area.

Geo Energy understands the impact 

that water have for ecosystem services 

and that is why we conduct stringent 

management implementation to ensure 

we minimise our impacts to water 

resources.

With the intensification of TBR operations, 

we saw an increase of all our water 

performance. For instance, we saw two 

times increase of our water withdrawal 

at our TBR site, whereas there was a 

reduction of 14% at our SDJ site. During 

this period, we also saw an increase 

of 22% in our water consumption. This 

trend is quite common throughout our 

environmental performance because of 

TBR’s production intensification.

foundation of waste management and 

streamline its processes. The handling and 

disposal of all our waste are managed by an 

approved waste management contractor 

where they have strict adherence to 

industry standards and local environmental 

regulation.

Our mining operations deal with many 

forms of waste in daily basis from liquid 

to solid waste. The MSDS streamlines our 

management in handling and storing the 

waste of our production by-products. With 

our employees’ safety as our top priority, 

we provide appropriate personal protective 

equipment (PPE) and training in handling 

hazardous wastes.

Hazardous Waste

In 2019, we reduced a total of 28% hazardous 

waste generated and transported to the 

approved contractor. The 152 tonnes total 

reduction is due to less waste generated in 

our SDJ site, however, our TBR site generated 

69 tonnes more hazardous waste than 

previous year.

Non-Hazardous Waste

Our non-hazardous waste mainly comes 

from our domestic waste, which includes 

kitchen waste, paper, wood, rubber, plastic, 

and glass. All of non-hazardous waste are 

transported and disposed by our waste 

contractor where they send it to approved 

landfills.
