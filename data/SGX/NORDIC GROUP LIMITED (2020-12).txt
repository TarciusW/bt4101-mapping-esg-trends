1.2 Message to stakeholders 

On behalf of our Board of Directors, it is my pleasure to present our 

Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 

(FY2020). 

The key to Nordic’s success is our continuous commitments in 

providing engineering solutions with excellent quality through our 

extensive experience and expertise. These continuous commitments 

allowed the Group to build quality in our products and services while 

taking care of our society and environment.  

While providing excellent quality solutions worldwide, the Group also 

emphasises on building a sustainable business model. Our 

management understands that to determine the performance of the 

Group, one has to look beyond the financial results. Thus, our 

management implemented several initiatives to ensure the Group 

contributes to the society and environment.  

While involving in the engineering works, wastes such as solid wastes, 

chemical wastes and waste water are unavoidable during our daily 

operations. Hence, the management implemented strict operating 

procedures to handle the treatment and disposal of these wastes. 

Reusable wastes are identified, separately stored and recycled to 

minimise the wastes. Non-reusable wastes such as chemical wastes 

and waste waters are treated with special care and disposed through 

proper channels as per the requirements.  

The Group has zero tolerance to workplace hazards and has over the 

years integrated work place safety to the corporate culture. From 

formal trainings to monitoring practices, the Group has strict set of 

policies to create a safe and healthy working environment for our 

employees. Notably, the Group has received several occupational 

safety and health related awards in year 2020 from our customers such 

as Pfizer, REC, PIPENET-APECO, Air Liquide, Chevron Oronite, 

Sebmcorp Marine and ExxonMobil.  

 

The following sections of this Sustainability Report summarises more 

initiatives the Group has taken to ensure a sustainable business model 

and a brighter future for our society and environment.  

 

Finally, we wish to confirm that the Board has considered sustainability 

issues as part of its strategic formulation, determined the material 

environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and overseen the 

management and monitoring of the material ESG factors. 

 

On behalf of the Board of Directors

2.3 Sustainability materiality matrix 

We recognise the need to continuously develop our responsible business approach in order to address growing 

stakeholder expectations around our impact on the economy, environment and society. As such, we 

periodically consult with our stakeholders to determine the issues that are most relevant to them and Nordic. 

Some of our stakeholder’s comments can be found in Appendix B. 

Using a materiality index, we align our responsible business priorities with the Nordic’s principal business and 

operational risks, as illustrated in the diagram below.  

We have also developed metrics to help us measure our progress, as indicated in our sustainability scorecard 

in Appendix A. We will review and adjust the matrix each year, as the external and business context changes.

3. Our performance 

3.1 How we measure our performance 

Our sustainability strategy is embedded into the appropriate parts of 

our business, with dedicated teams for each focus area, and 

coordination by our relevant departmental managers. 

Progress will be tracked in two key ways: measuring performance 

against metrics, and evaluating how well the programs have advanced, 

through a series of ‘commitments’.  

Metrics and targets 

We have established key performance indicators for each of the four 

focus areas outlined in our sustainability strategy since we adopted 

sustainability reporting in 2017. Periodically, we plan to introduce new 

metrics and update targets to ensure alignment with our strategy. 

Commitments 

To ensure we have a robust sustainability program in place, we will 

also publish the key initiatives we plan to implement within the next 

year. 

 

3.2 Workplace safety 

Overview 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Working in a highly regulated and hazardous industry, our Group 

adopts a culture where health and safety are of paramount importance. 

Our Group has set a policy that demands us to adhere to relevant legal 

and regulatory requirements and recognised industry standards. Our 

Group places high emphasis on safety and believes strongly in 

maintaining zero occupational injuries, diseases, property and 

environmental damage over the course of our work. 

We constantly review and improve our internal processes; conduct 

proper training and planning to uphold our safety standards. Our 

people represent our Group’s most important assets and we strive 

continuously to create a safe and healthy working environment for all 

our employees to thrive in.  

Upholding safety standards 

The Group has a set of policies that demand all employees to adhere 

to the relevant safety laws and regulations, industry standards as well 

as customer’s requirements (e.g. ISO 45001:2018). 

We understand that prevention is crucial when it comes to managing 

safety in the workplace. Each business unit has a designated Health, 

Safety and Environment (HSE) representative responsible to educate 

employees on the importance of safety in the workplace.  

Monthly and yearly HSE meetings are conducted and attended by 

employees with the aim to increase the awareness of employees 

toward safety in the workplace, including the sharing of preferred safety 

practices and behaviors, and safety incidents during the period.

Sustainability Report for the year ended 31 December 2020 

Nordic Group Limited | 7 

 

 

 

 

 

Other functions of the HSE representatives include the investigation of 

safety incidents and breaches. Investigation is carried out to identify 

the root cause and tabled during the HSE meeting for sharing.  

In addition, employee performance appraisals include safety 

performance. Breaches to safety requirements will be reflected in the 

annual performance appraisal as demerit points. 

While we believe that incident prevention is key, we also prepare our 

employees to handle and respond to the emergencies. This is 

important to reduce and limit the impact and casualty as a result of the 

incidents. 

In 2020, the Group achieved 0 fatalities. However, there were 5 serious 

incidents and 6 workplace injuries involving our employees for which 

safety guidelines have been highlighted to the workers to prevent re-

occurrence.  

Going forward, we will continue to concentrate our efforts and work on 

upholding our safety standards to achieve the following: 

• 

Ensure employee’s compliance with the relevant safety 

regulations (internal and external); 

• 

Utilise effective communication channels and HSE training 

programs that helps enhance the overall safety awareness of 

employees; and 

Minimise serious incidents and workplace injuries and achieve zero 

fatalities. 

Working at heights 

The Group’s engineering works will unavoidably expose employees to 

working at heights (WAH), particularly in our engineering repair and 

scaffolding businesses.  

WAH is a major concern for the Group over the years as these incidents 

accounts for more than half of the workplace fatalities in Singapore. We 

strictly abide to the recommendations issued by the National WAH 

Taskforce to help reduce WAH accidents. From these initiatives, our 

workers will better understand the regulations and comply with the law 

while working safely at heights. 

Our businesses have also received other quality certifications such as 

the ISO 45001:2018 – Erection &amp; Dismantling of Metal Scaffolding and 

BizSAFE Star and Partner awards. These are testament to our 

achievements in meeting stringent quality and safety requirements 

over the years.  

Personal protection  

The Group has strict requirements on the use of Personnel Protective 

Equipment (PPE) in the worksites. Periodical inspection is conducted 

by the HSE department to ensure the proper use of PPEs by workers.  

Workers who were found to be in breach of PPE requirements at the 

worksites will be subjected to strict internal penalties.   

PPEs provided to the workers are also carefully chosen based on the 

quality and the safety needs of the workers conducting different 

engineering works.

Annual health checks 

Working in hazardous environment can subject workers to health 

issues. To minimise the impact, the Group ensures high quality and 

adequate PPEs are used by workers all times. 

In addition, worksites subjected to periodical internal as well as external 

inspections to ensure the worksites hazards are removed or controlled.  

As required by ISO 45001:2018, the Group also provides periodical 

health checks for the employees to ensure the employees’ health is 

properly monitored. Other than pre-employment health checks, special 

work positions depending on the exposure-level to hazards, such as 

chemicals, will be subject to additional in-depth health checks such as: 

• 

Manganese contamination test for welders 

• 

Blood test for benzene for chemical cleaners 

• 

Health checks for asbestos workers 

Safety awards and accreditation 

The Group has received various safety awards over the years and 

these awards are testament to the Group’s internal methodologies and 

processes which were thoroughly reviewed as part of the evaluation 

process for the award. The Group’s performance in 2020 is as follows: 

 

 

• 

PIPENET-APECO Certificate of

3.3 Productivity 

Overview 

Productivity is the key to the economic growth of a nation. Singapore 

has always emphasised on the productivity of the nation’s work force 

to sustain economic growth. To contribute to the nation’s economy, the 

Group keeps track of the productivity in every aspect of the businesses 

that includes securing new projects, exploring new business 

opportunities, value creation to the customers and their feedback, skills 

competency of employee and workers as well as resources acquisition 

and optimisation in the individual projects.  

Economic performance 

The Group strives to deliver upmost satisfaction to its customers by 

understanding their needs and meeting them through deliverables of 

the highest quality. This is reflected in the Group’s safety and quality 

track records and various awards given by the customers. In addition, 

the Group has established a set of internal controls and process 

manuals to adhere to closely to ensure our work is completed to 

specification and of high quality, including ISO 9001:2008, ISO 

45001:2018, ISO14001:2015 and BizSAFE Star. 

In addition to these, we constantly seek for new solutions through 

innovation to keep abreast with the latest technology and processes in 

the industry and perform regular reviews of our quality policy 

requirements so as to adhere to stringent product and service 

consistency and legal requirements. 

 

Supply chain management 

To contribute to the local economy, the Group has close business 

relationship with reliable local suppliers. In 2020, 86.8% of the Group’s 

purchases was spent on local suppliers. This was similar to the local 

purchases made in 2019. 

Localised supply chains help us to develop closer relationships with 

our suppliers to ensure the proper alignment of our policies that will 

help us maintain a high level of quality and integrity in the procurement 

of goods and services for the Group. It also benefits the local economy, 

by economic value and job creation to the local communities.  

The Group has comprehensive procurement policies and procedures 

in place to effectively manage our supply chain. This is crucial to help 

us to achieve our goals by optimising the resources available.  

Our suppliers must abide by the general Terms and Conditions of our 

Purchase Contract or Purchase Order. The Group encourages fair 

competition between potential suppliers and fair purchase practices 

that achieve constructive business relationship.  

Performance appraisal  

To increase the productivity, the Group has comprehensive 

performance appraisal programme and rewards system based on the 

result of the appraisal. The performance appraisal programme is 

essential to the Group to understand the skills level of the employees 

and appropriate training programmes can be designed to fill up the skill 

gaps.

The employee annual performance appraisal has at least 70% of 

quantifiable evaluation criteria. Also, the Group actively collects the 

information of the performance throughout the year such as inputs from 

direct supervisors, client scoring and feedbacks, mentor and mentee 

system for new employee, as well as periodical employee 

communication sessions.  

This collected information allow the Group to understand the 

performance and skills development needs of each team and individual 

employee from multiple aspects. This is crucial for the Group to 

develop annual training programs for employee that are designed to 

enhance the skills of the employee and aims to improve the overall 

productivity.  

In 2020, all of our employees are at least subject to an annual 

performance appraisal by their superiors. We seek to continue this 

practice in the coming year. 

Workforce development 

We believe in providing our employees a safe environment to work in, 

both from an internal control and industry standard perspective. We 

remain committed to provide equal and ample opportunities for 

employees to upgrade and hone their skill sets in order for them to 

excel. To achieve this, the management builds several two-way 

communication channels to ensure the career development needs of 

the employee are taken into consideration whenever it is possible.  

Opportunities for continuous learning in the workplace is very 

important. Every employee has equal opportunities to upgrade and 

sharpen their skill sets through the well-planned training programs. 

In 2020, the Group’s employees received an average of 7.5 training 

hours each. Training Hours dropped significantly as compared to 

previous years because of restrictions placed due to the Covid-19 

pandemic. Training centres were shut and restrictions placed on 

number of attendees when they reopened after the Circuit Breaker 

period. Internal trainings were also limited due to safe management 

measures where workers were not allowed to congregate or mix 

together from other companies/dormitories. 

Hiring skilled workers continues to be a strategy adopted on repeat 

projects where no new skills were required.  

 

Certified On-the-Job Training Centre (COJTC) 

The Group has COJTCs at its subsidiaries, Multiheight and Ensure.  

COJTCs are certified by Institute of Technical Education (ITE) of 

Singapore with the aim to help companies to develop high quality on-

the-job training (OJT) practices. Companies to be certified for COJTC 

are required to meet strict standards and requirements that prove the 

company has quality OJT system. Periodical reviews will be conducted 

by ITE to ensure the certified companies continue to make efforts in 

improving their OJT system.  

Having COJTCs in both Multiheight and Ensure allows the Group to 

provide highest quality of OJTs to the employee and conduct courses 

and specialised trainings to sharpen employees’ skill sets.

3.4 Environmental protection 

Overview 

We are committed to environmental protection, reducing carbon 

emissions, preventing pollution, minimising wastage and utilising our 

resources efficiently. Our Group sets in place strict operating 

procedures to handle the treatment, disposal of waste and takes pride 

in adopting greener solutions constantly in our daily operations to 

reduce environmental pollution. 

Comprehensive policies are developed to ensure the Group’s 

commitment towards environmental protection, reducing carbon 

emissions, preventing pollution, minimising waste and efficiency on 

resources utilisation can be achieved during our daily operations and 

in every project that we undertake.  

Carbon emission reduction 

The corporate culture of protecting the environment is reflected in every 

operation and project undertaken by Nordic. 

The Group committed to positive action on climate change and 

dedicated to reducing the carbon emission in our engineering projects. 

Employees are educated and reminded to save the electricity and 

diesel for transportation on a yearly basis through the HSE training 

program. The Group also has policies and procedures to guide 

employee to reduce energy consumption well ensuring the quality of 

works. 

To determine the carbon footprint, we collect energy usage data from 

each of our businesses and then calculate our total annual greenhouse 

gas emissions. 

In 2020, the Group generated a carbon footprint of 551.0 tonnes of 

carbon dioxide emission (tCO2e) with a carbon emission intensity of 

99.50 kgCO2e per square meter of total operation floor area. The 

intensity increased because of increased diesel consumption with the 

new safe management controls. The number of workers allowed on 

each vehicle was reduced drastically.  

We follow the Greenhouse Gas Protocol established by the World 

Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable 

Development, the standard manual for measuring corporate 

greenhouse gas emissions. Using the “control method”, we include 

100% of the emissions associated with businesses which we directly 

control. Our carbon footprint includes: 

• 

All fuels used directly by our companies (Scope 1 emissions) 

• 

All purchased electricity used in our facilities (Scope 2 

emissions) 

The Group will continue its efforts and monitor the performance on the 

carbon emission reduction.

Waste management 

Waste disposal is a significant environmental challenge to engineering 

projects. The Group adopts the procedures of reuse, treatment and 

dispose to handle the wastes created during the operation of 

engineering works.  

As part of our on-going efforts to protect the environment, our Group 

implemented a waste recycling programme which involves the 

installation of separate bins to collect reusable waste for reuse. In 

2020, the Group recycled a total of 34 tonnes of waste for reuse. The 

decrease is due to Envipure which is newly acquired and their 

engineering work has less recycled waste as compared to other entities 

like Austin and Ensure.   

Chemicals and hydrocarbon waste products produced by the Group, 

such as paints and engine oil, are treated with special care, stored in 

locked and isolated environment, and disposed through proper

Saving water 

Water scarcity is a growing concern around the world and a serious 

global challenge that we must work together to address. Water 

consumption in the engineering industries are intensive. Hence, the 

Group has adopted a wide range of measures to reduce water 

consumption at the project sites including water recycling system and 

HSE training program that remind employee to save and recycle the 

water.  

In 2020, total water consumption of the Group was 10,942 liters with a 

water consumption intensity of 1.98 liters per square meter of total 

operation floor area. The significant increase was due to the workers 

living at the factory premises (temporary living quarters) due to the 

lockdown situation at several dormitories. 

The Group will continue its efforts and monitor the performance on the 

water consumption. Progress and performance on the reduction on 

water consumption will be reported in the following year.

3.5 People and community 

Overview 

Our people are our most important asset. We strive to create an 

enjoyable working environment to our employees. The Group has 

various employee events and awards conducted to appreciate the 

efforts of our employees and recognise their accomplishments.  

Through our people, we are also committed in making positive 

contributions to our community by giving back to the society and 

helping the less privileged. 

Employee recognition 

To recognise the efforts of our employees, the Group has various 

recognition awards to serve as encouragement for the employees to 

excel and grow together with the Company. These include long 

services award (for example, 5, 10, 15, 20 years etc) and safe 

performance self-assessment award (good behavioral approach 

towards safety in working).  

The group understands the importance of having work life balance for 

employees. A happy working environment will bring the best out of 

the employees. Despite the pandemic, the group made time to 

recognise our workers who were hit the most by arranging 

appreciation lunch and dinner for them. The group also liaised with 

NGOs to organise and distribute basic necessities such as masks, 

hand sanitizers etc to our workers and to educate and constantly 

remind them to take care of their health. Other team bonding activities 

were put on hold but we hope to have more employee engagement 

in the coming year. 

In 2020, the Group has an employee turnover rate of 37.9%. This was 

an decrease from 2019. This decrease was mainly due to workers 

being locked down with no flights to or from their countries. We will 

continue to listen to our employees and seek to identify ways to 

improve their working environment and ensure that their needs are 

met.  

Worker’s dormitory 

The Group periodically assesses the needs of our employees and 

strives to reasonably improve their welfare.  

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we have segregated our workers based 

on the cohorting plans across all the dormitories in Singapore. This 

allows us to have business continuity and also less stressful for our 

workers who were already locked down for long periods of time in April 

to July 2020.   

Community initiatives 

In FY2020, our Group did not take part or make donations in any 

community initiatives due to the shut down n restrictions in social 

gatherings due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
