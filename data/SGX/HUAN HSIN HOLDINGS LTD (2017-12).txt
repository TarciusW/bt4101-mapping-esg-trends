MESSAGE FROM BOARD 

BOARD STATEMENT 

 

Huan Hsin Holdings Limited proudly presents our 2017 Sustainability Report. This report is 

our company’s very first Sustainability Report being published as a requirement mandated 

by the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX), demonstrating our commitment to sustainable 

business operations. It highlights Huan Hsin’s sustainability initiatives, best practices, and 

performance. This is aligned with the ever-increasing importance and emphasis on 

sustainability across global financial markets. At Huan Hsin, we view this increased emphasis 

on sustainability as an opportunity to further improve our business operations and address 

material ESG issues relevant to our stakeholders.  

Currently, at Huan Hsin, we are working towards achieving sustainable growth for the Group 

by continuously upgrading our business model and strategies. We intend to integrate 

sustainability into the vertical integration of our manufacturing operations, to deliver high-

quality finished products that will not only maximise operations, but also satisfaction of all 

stakeholders. Our ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certifications are also clear testimonies to our 

focus on quality products and customer satisfaction.  

Our Board and Management are also committed to strengthening relationships with our 

valued stakeholders – investors, customers, employees and all business associates. We 

believe that ensuring synergy throughout our value chain is essential for our company to 

overcome the challenges faced, and enable us to prosper together. We are always open to 

feedback and would welcome any suggestions for the company moving forward. 

 

Although the idea of sustainability is relatively new, we will improve our performance and 

proactively intertwine sustainable practices with our business strategy. In the future, we 

will progressively include more metrics and quantitative targets to measure our 

sustainability performance – with the ultimate goal to build a sustainable business for the 

future.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND MATERIALITY REVIEW 

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

We recognise that stakeholders play an important strategic role in maintaining our 

company’s long-term growth as well as responsible business development in ESG aspects.   

Our business activities involve a diverse range of stakeholders, such as our shareholders, 

suppliers, customers, regulators, and employees. These stakeholders are instrumental to 

the success of our business and able to influence sustainability performance. Therefore, 

maintaining effective communication channels with our stakeholders are of utmost 

importance to Huan Hsin. 

We communicate regularly with our stakeholders by providing an open and transparent 

channel for their concerns, reviewing and considering those concerns and responding in a 

timely manner. This allows us to continuously improve our business processes. 

[This material references Disclosures 102-42, 102-43 and 102-44 from GRI 102: General Disclosure 2016] 

 

RESULTS FROM MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

The materiality assessment process was conducted to identify the material Environment, 

Social, and Governance (“ESG”) factors. The identification of ESG factors was performed by 

conducting an industry benchmarking against peers. This allowed us to understand what 

are the common main concerns faced by similar companies and their stakeholders.  

Next, internal discussions were conducted with employees from departments that were 

proxy to the various stakeholder groups. For example, the Human Resources department 

represented the opinions of our employees, the Procurement department gave feedback 

from our suppliers and the Customer Service department represented our customers.  

Our management followed up by revising the ESG factors raised by respective stakeholders. 

We evaluated and prioritised the importance of the factors raised by considering the 

company’s significant economic, environmental and/or social impacts in our daily 

operations. The top ESG factors consolidated and subsequently endorsed by our 

management.

PEOPLE 

OUR APPROACH 

At Huan Hsin, we are committed to maximising their employment capabilities. We achieve 

this by organising comprehensive training programmes, not only when they first join the 

company, but throughout their career here. This training is also necessary to ensure the 

highest standards of workplace safety and product quality. Furthermore, we believe in 

establishing a strong team culture at work, where all our employees respect and look out 

for one another.  

[This material references Disclosures 103-1, 103-2, 103-3 from GRI 103: Management Approach 2016] 

 

EMPLOYMENT DATA 

Due to restructuring efforts this year, Huan Hsin had a turnover of 101 employees and two 

new hires. Recruitment of new employees is conducted in line with Huan Hsin’s Human 

Resource Policy. This policy is aligned with Singapore’s fair employment guidelines laid out

EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT 

Huan Hsin is fully committed to ensuring that all our employees receive on-the-job training 

so that they can be equipped with relevant skills. We provide technical training to ensure 

that our employees can be efficient and effective in their respective roles at work.   

Our training programmes also ensure that employees understand the importance of 

workplace safety and responsible usage of energy, which are key priorities in our 

organisation. We provide training to our employees to ensure that they are aware of 

potential hazards and respective safe operating procedures. 

We also encourage employees to participate in teambuilding workshops to foster greater 

workplace cohesion and trust. These activities help managers to better understand the 

employees working under them and tailor their leadership style to match their needs. The 

graphs below show our employees broken down by gender and category.  

We plan to expand our training programmes to provide more personal development 

opportunities for our employees in the future. We are currently developing a management 

training programme to prepare high-performing individuals with great leadership potential 

for the next step in their careers.

ENVIRONMENT 

OUR APPROACH 

Huan Hsin is fully aware of the increased environmental consciousness within the 

manufacturing industry and has identified the ESG aspect as one of our top priorities. We 

are ISO 14001 certified and have company policies on environmental issues documented in 

our Environmental Health and Safety Manual. All members of the company – from 

employees to Board members – are expected to read and understand the guidelines stated 

in the manual. We encourage our employees to become strong advocates for the 

environment, and ensure they adhere to our policies.  

Our Environmental Health and Safety Manual is also applicable to all potential suppliers. 

Suppliers have to meet a strict set of environmental criteria in order to be a part of our 

supply chain. We believe that it is our responsibility to not only ensure that we conduct our 

business responsibly, but also encourage businesses who work alongside us to adopt safe 

environmental practices.

ENERGY 

As our main operations are in manufacturing and production, energy consumption is a key 

issues of concern. We have established energy management guidelines to effectively 

manage energy usage within our organisation. Various roles and responsibilities are outlined 

clearly in our Environmental Health and Safety Manual guidelines, which ensure that 

employees are mindful of their actions and collect relevant energy data.  

Many of our guidelines require strong commitment and responsibility from our employees. 

For example our employees are encouraged to minimise energy usage by reminding one 

another to switch off their equipment when not in use or leaving their workstations for long 

period of time. Managerial staff also conduct regular inspections and keep track of weekly 

energy consumption levels.  

With these measures in place, we aim to achieve greater efficiency in the use of energy to 

lower our operating costs.  

 

Figure 2: Energy Consumption (kWh) 

 

Our total energy consumption for 2017 was recorded at 1,931,500 kWh. 

In the future, we are looking to implement additional initiatives to minimise our energy 

consumption. We intend to establish Energy Management Policy to regulate energy usage 

per employee based on their duties. At the same time, we plan to educate our employees 

about energy consumption, such as through poster campaign at workstations. These posters 

will contain bite-sized information on the benefits of saving energy, as well as reminders 

about responsible day-to-day energy usage.

SUPPLIER ASSESSMENT 

 

At Huan Hsin, we evaluate our potential suppliers. It is our practice to include applicable 

environmental standards in our supplier contracts. Some of these standards include 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations, the impact of the supplier’s products 

and services and impact of the supplier’s transport operations on the environment. 

Employees have detailed roles and responsibilities that are detailed in the Environmental 

Health and Safety Manual – from creating a new case file for each supplier, evaluating the 

materials they use in manufacturing, to ensuring safety and environmental compliance. 

This year, we have onboarded 28 new suppliers, drawing our total number of suppliers to 

177. The graph below shows the percentage of new suppliers that were assessed based on 

our company’s environmental standards.  

 

Figure 3: Percentage of new suppliers that were assessed based on company's environmental standards 

To ensure all new and potential suppliers are assessed, we plan to establish standard 

procedures. We will follow up closely and report our progress in the next report.
