shaping all aspects of our business 

in an even more sustainable manner 

and enabling clients with Industry 4.0 

transformation standards.  We also share 

in the deep heritage of the Boustead 

Group under Boustead Singapore 

Limited, which has contributed almost 

two centuries of progress, truly an 

unrivalled milestone in Singapore’s 

corporate history as the Boustead Group 

maintains the longstanding position as 

Singapore’s oldest continuous business 

– a practical and symbolic reflection of 

longevity.

Even as sustainability reporting takes 

centre stage among the world’s latest 

corporate reporting initiatives, we feel 

that being rooted in the deep heritage of 

the Boustead Group, the term ‘Longevity 

Reporting’ is more all encompassing and 

relevant than ‘Sustainability Reporting’.

As you read this report, we hope that you 

gain an in-depth understanding of how 

we ensure the longevity of our business 

and the wider ecosystem that we are 

interconnected with.  We also share how 

we strive towards what the Boustead

Welcome to Boustead Projects 

Limited’s FY2019 Longevity Report.

As Singapore’s leading real estate 

solutions provider for smart eco-

sustainable business park and industrial 

developments, we have demonstrated 

over two decades of pioneership in 

industrial real estate solutions including 

the design-and-build and development 

of advanced eco-sustainable facilities 

serving some of the world’s best 

corporations.  Our contributions to 

transforming Singapore’s industrial 

landscape over the past two 

decades have been accompanied by 

transformative technologies that are

LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS

transform our business, all aligned with 

our progressive nature.

On the topic of longevity, let us take 

a moment to express our heartiest 

congratulations to Singapore on the 

celebration of its historic Bicentennial.  

With no natural resources, Singapore 

has had to be innovative in its approach 

to industry over the past several 

decades to provide the optimal business 

environment to attract investments 

in pivotal industries and help these 

industries to tap on the industry of 

Singaporeans in a sustainable manner.

In this regard, we have contributed to the 

transformation of Singapore’s industrial 

landscape over the past two decades.  

Our success has been accompanied by 

our progressive nature, pioneership and 

also the technological transformation 

that has shaped our business over the 

past few years.  As we move ahead of the 

curve on the Singapore Government’s 

Industry Transformation Maps for the 

construction and real estate sectors, 

our investments in transformative 

technologies have sharpened our edge 

as one of Singapore’s leading real estate 

solutions providers.

This transformation – currently best 

represented in ALICE – is taking us 

forward elsewhere.  During FY2019, the 

awards of the JTC Multi-Storey Recycling 

Facility (“JTC MSRF”) and Surbana 

Jurong Campus (“SJC”) further validate 

our technology-driven strategy, which 

has gained clients who value Industry 

4.0 transformation standards.  JTC MSRF 

has been touted as one of the Singapore 

Government’s landmark projects to 

shift the nation increasingly towards the 

circular economy, where maximum value 

is extracted from resources through 

recovery, recycling and regeneration.  

SJC is Singapore’s first large-scale 

industrial development to be awarded 

the Green Mark Platinum – Super Low 

Energy, a huge step towards minimal to 

zero carbon footprints.

We have successfully demonstrated 

to clients that smart eco-sustainable 

business park and industrial 

developments are present-day realities, 

designed from the ground up to fulfil the 

promise of Industry 4.0 transformation 

standards while simultaneously 

Dear Fellow Stakeholders,

It gives us great pleasure to present to 

you the Boustead Projects FY2019 

Longevity Report for the financial year 

ended 31 March 2019.

This past year, we recorded a strong 

performance even as Singapore’s 

industrial real estate sector remained 

somewhat subdued.  During this 

period, we secured S$633 million of 

new contracts which is a historic high, 

including one private and one public 

sector contract each worth over S$200 

million.  In addition, we completed 

Singapore’s first truly smart business 

park development, ALICE@Mediapolis 

(“ALICE”), secured four development 

deals and formed three new strategic 

partnerships while continuing with 

the adoption of new technologies to 

minimising emissions.  We aim to 

play our part in providing smart eco-

sustainable solutions that promote 

longevity of ecosystems and transform 

industry, both literally and figuratively.

As you read this report, we hope that you 

gain an in-depth understanding of how 

we ensure the longevity of our business 

and the wider ecosystem that that we are 

interconnected with.  We also share how 

we strive towards what the Boustead 

Group has achieved in longevity over 

almost two centuries and how this 

translates to delivering sustainable value 

and progress to key stakeholders, along 

with the communities that we reside in 

and our collective home – Planet Earth.  

Our performance, policies and practices 

on material economic, environmental, 

social and governance topics are 

explained.

Thank you for entrusting us with the role 

of being a responsible corporate citizen, 

one which we hope to honour for many 

more decades to come.  This journey 

is an ultramarathon, one which we will 

continue running and hope to have you 

join, even if only for part of the way.  Have 

an enjoyable and insightful read.

2.1 ABOUT THIS REPORT

2.1.1 Report Period &amp; Scope

This is the Boustead Projects FY2019 

Longevity Report, a publication 

dedicated to providing a more holistic 

review of our performance, especially 

covering non-financial areas such as 

environmental, social and governance 

(“ESG”) topics that are material to our 

business and key stakeholders.

This report contains at least two full-

years of data on material ESG topics and 

is aligned with our financial reporting 

period from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 

2019 (“FY2019”).  Our previous report – 

inaugural report – was aligned with our 

financial reporting period from 1 April 

2017 to 31 March 2018 (“FY2018”) and 

issued on 22 November 2018.

This report should be read in conjunction 

with the Boustead Projects FY2019 

Annual Report for context.  It should 

also be noted that the governance topic 

has not been fully discussed in this 

report.  Our latest Corporate Governance 

Report is available in its full text within 

the Boustead Projects FY2019 Annual 

Report from pages 54 to 76.

The term ‘Longevity’ has been used 

in direct replacement of the term 

‘Sustainability’.

2.1.2 Report Content

Content in this report was defined by 

identifying and prioritising our material 

ESG topics through an ESG materiality 

assessment process.

This report has been prepared with 

material references to Global Reporting

at least two years of comparative data 

as required by GRI Standards: Core.  

The respective GRI Standards that have 

been applied are available in the GRI 

Content Index listed on pages 60 to 

65.  References have also been made 

to the United Nations Sustainable 

Development Goals.

This report fully complies with the 

requirements of the SGX-ST Listing 

Rules Practice Note 7.6 Sustainability 

Reporting Guide.

Where the relevant material ESG topics 

have already been discussed in detail in 

the Boustead Projects FY2019 Annual 

Report, we shall make reference to such 

discussions without directly replicating 

them in this report.

Data is presented using the International 

System of Units where possible 

or standard international units of 

measurement, with conversion factors 

mentioned in relevant sections.  

Monetary values are presented in our 

functional reporting currency, Singapore 

dollars, unless otherwise indicated.

INTRODUCTION

our business and ability to achieve our 

long-term objectives to be adaptable and 

relevant, deliver sustainable value and 

progress, and make a positive impact 

economically, environmentally and 

socially on the world.  The views of both 

external and internal stakeholders are 

taken into account when determining 

ESG materiality.

To ensure that material ESG topics 

remain up-to-date, we periodically review 

current and emerging megatrends, 

changes in the economic, political, 

regulatory and ESG landscape in the 

geographic markets and industry 

clusters that we operate in, along with 

the views of key stakeholders, and 

update these in our assessment process.

2.2.1 Key Stakeholder Engagement

We define key stakeholders as being 

groups that our business may have 

a significant impact on or vice versa, 

and who have a vested interest in the 

way that we conduct business.  After a 

thorough review, nine key stakeholders 

were identified as shown here.

across the industrial real estate value chain.  These activities include design, 

value engineering, project management, construction management and 

the application of proprietary domain expertise and extend over a regional 

network of key stakeholder relationships.  Creating the ideal environment for 

our team to thrive in will eventually translate to delivery of sustainable value 

and progress to key stakeholders.

Materiality Assessment Process

In FY2018, we conducted a materiality 

assessment workshop with our key team 

members including senior management 

and department heads in Singapore, 

who acted as proxies for the nine key 

stakeholders that have been identified, 

and highlighted and prioritised material 

ESG topics of relevance to these key 

stakeholders.  Following the completion 

of the materiality assessment workshop, 

we were able to consolidate and validate 

12 material ESG topics for inclusion in 

this report.  Community development 

was not material but reported due 

to its significance to the business 

environment.

2.2.3 Opportunities &amp; Risks

We are vigilant in ensuring that our 

strategies to enhance stakeholder 

value are well-supported by sound risk 

management.  Our material ESG topics 

present us with both opportunities 

(if we embrace the right approaches 

to managing these ESG topics) and 

risks (if we neglect these ESG topics), 

which are supplemented by our robust 

existing systems and Enterprise Risk 

Management Framework.

SDGs universally apply to all countries 

with the ultimate aim of mobilising 

all stakeholders – governments, civil 

societies, the private sector and 

others – to collectively contribute to 

ending poverty, fighting inequality and 

tackling climate change through three 

dimensions of sustainable development: 

economic growth, social inclusion and 

environmental protection.

INTRODUCTION

OVER TWO DECADES OF 

PIONEERSHIP AND TRANSFORMING 

INDUSTRY

Over Boustead Projects’ two decades 

of pioneership and transforming 

industry through the design-and-

build and development of smart eco-

sustainable business park and industrial 

developments, we have performed our 

role as a responsible corporate citizen, 

building business and trust with key 

stakeholders regionally and delivering 

sustainable value and progress to them.  

Through our pursuit of business with 

a greater purpose, we have generated 

and distributed tremendous economic 

value and environmental, social and 

governance (“ESG”) benefits to key 

stakeholders including our team, 

clients, strategic partners, suppliers, 

lenders, shareholders, the media, 

governments and communities.  Since 

our establishment in 1996, we have 

registered continuous profitability every 

year which we believe to be absolutely 

necessary if we are to be able to 

maintain our generation of sustainable 

value and progress to key stakeholders 

and reinvest for long-term success and 

longevity.

A common consideration in evolving 

our business model, pioneering new 

methodologies and investing in new 

acquisitions, developments and 

geographic markets in the industrial 

real estate sector has been based on 

assessing whether specific business 

expansions provide sustainable profit 

and simultaneously also serve a greater 

purpose through the direct and indirect 

benefits shared with as many key 

stakeholders in as many economic 

and ESG facets as possible.  We have 

refrained from specific business 

expansions that could be highly 

profitable but yet are questionable on 

ethical and moral grounds, considered 

exploitative in nature or deemed as 

short-term and unsustainable to begin 

with.  The long and short of it is that 

business expansions must make good 

sense and instil a sense of good.

In line with this, our team, organisational 

ecosystem, and engineered products 

and services – primarily smart eco-

sustainable industrial real estate 

solutions (“solutions”) – have to 

inherently uphold the high honourable 

conduct and quality standards that have 

been associated with the Boustead 

Group for almost two centuries.  In 

addition, we embrace transformation or 

aim to be transformative where possible, 

in order to promptly adapt to new 

megatrends and the prevailing global 

landscape that has emerged over time.

Our pioneering achievements in 

the industrial real estate sector are 

summarised here.

In FY2019, our business was categorised 

into two key revenue-generating 

segments: Design-and-Build and Real

Smart Eco-Sustainable Solutions

Our integrated capabilities – 

development, design-and-build, 

leasehold portfolio management and 

ownership, and facilities management 

– are reinforced by our excellent quality 

and environmental, health and safety 

(“EHS”) track records, and outright 

market leadership in building advanced 

eco-sustainable business park and 

industrial developments.

Our capabilities are aimed at helping 

clients to achieve highly effective 

and cost competitive solutions that 

raise efficiency and sustainability.  

Furthermore, our full-fledged IDD 

platform brings various development, 

design and building disciplines under 

one roof and eliminates significant 

additional costs, coordination, time and 

wastage for clients, with 7D BIM as the 

centrepiece digitalisation technology for 

significantly enhanced productivity.  One 

of our key design-and-build offerings 

is value engineering, the systematic 

design or redesign of a custom-built 

development to ensure that clients enjoy 

greater or similar facility performance, 

function and quality at significantly 

reduced costs.  We eliminate potential 

over-design and over-construction 

that is usually present where multiple 

independent third-parties are involved.  

Through value engineering, we continue 

to unlock value for clients with significant 

savings in cost, coordination, equipment, 

materials and time as compared to 

conventional construction projects 

and have changed the norms by which 

developments are delivered.

Our capabilities now include pioneering 

the introduction of smart building 

capabilities and proven transformative 

technologies for smart eco-sustainable 

developments in line with Industry 

4.0 transformation standards 

and the Singapore Government’s 

Industry Transformation Programme 

(“ITP”)1, which lays out 23 Industry 

Transformation Maps (“ITMs”) under six 

industry clusters to build a Future-Ready 

Singapore.  Our direct contributions 

to the ITP are made within the ‘Built 

Environment’ industry cluster, while we 

provide indirect contributions to support 

transformations in other industry clusters 

– essential domestic services, lifestyle, 

manufacturing, modern services, and 

trade and connectivity – through the 

smart eco-sustainable solutions that we 

provide to the key players within these 

industry clusters.

3.2 SMART ECO-SUSTAINABLE 

SOLUTIONS

Our smart eco-sustainable solutions are 

experiential and extremely functional 

spaces that are designed around clients’ 

key processes and requirements, where 

talented client teams from the world’s 

best corporations are placed in the ideal 

built environment to collaborate and:

• 

Give birth to new ideas and 

innovations – R&amp;D centres;

• 

Create solutions and technologies 

that drive the global economy – high-

tech engineering and manufacturing 

facilities;

• 

Distribute solutions and 

technologies globally – logistics 

facilities; and

• 

Provide for the flow and storage of 

vast amounts of data – data centres.

INTRODUCTION

To do so, we continue to develop 

solutions that are smart and eco-

sustainable, meaning that they have 

a positive ecological impact.  ‘Eco-’ 

based on the root word ‘ecological’ is 

defined as ‘relating to or concerned 

with the relation of living organisms 

to one another and to their physical 

surroundings.’2   Our smart eco-

sustainable solutions are expected to 

deliver primary benefits to clients, usually 

economic in nature, and secondary 

benefits to clients and other key 

stakeholders, which transcend economic 

value into ESG benefits, with an overall 

positive bottomline for the entire 

ecosystem that our solutions fit into.

This is extremely important given that 

the United Nations’ Global Status 

Report 2018 states that buildings and 

construction together account for 

36% of global final energy usage and 

40% of energy-related carbon dioxide 

emissions in 2017 when upstream power 

generation is included.3   Furthermore, 

83% of energy-related carbon dioxide 

emissions related to buildings and 

construction are generated by the 

energy consumed when completed 

buildings are in use4 or what is referred 

to as operating energy.  As such, 

our smart eco-sustainable solutions 

which are already directly influencing 

and reducing energy loss, emissions, 

pollution, and energy and water 

consumption have the potential to do so 

in the future as well during the highest 

emissions period in the multi-decade 

building lifecycle.

The primary and secondary benefits, 

industry diversification and long-term 

market outlook for our solutions are 

summarised here.

3.2.1 Solutions Supporting Economic 

Activities

Our smart eco-sustainable solutions 

have been implemented to support 

niche segments of hard infrastructure, 

primarily business and industrial parks 

that form the backbone of economic 

activities in both developed and 

emerging markets.  Today, our smart 

eco-sustainable solutions integrate 

Industry 4.0 transformation standards 

that increasingly support clients with 

their business evolutions.

3.2.2 Solutions With Additional ESG 

Benefits – Green Buildings

Outside of the economic value 

that clients receive, our smart eco-

sustainable solutions also offer 

significant secondary benefits in ESG

facets.  With the eco-sustainability 

practices of clients coming under 

increased scrutiny from their own key 

stakeholders, we have been delivering 

smart eco-sustainable solutions that 

help them to match their global growth 

strategies with better management 

of their ecological footprints and 

compliance with environmental 

regulations.  Clients who embrace our 

smart eco-sustainable solutions also 

receive social benefits such as boosting 

and protecting their relationships and 

reputations with their key stakeholders.

Our smart eco-sustainable solutions 

have helped clients to significantly 

reduce energy loss, emissions, 

pollution, waste, and energy and water 

consumption throughout the multi-

decade building lifecycle.  Our smart 

eco-sustainable built environment 

is conducive to create a healthy and 

productive internal environment for 

clients, while reducing the ecological 

impact on the natural environment and 

surrounding communities.

INTRODUCTION

large-scale industrial development to 

be awarded the Green Mark Platinum – 

Super Low Energy (“GM-SLE”), a huge 

step towards minimal to zero carbon 

footprints.  Introduced in 2018, the GM-

SLE rating is the BCA’s latest higher 

benchmark for best-in-class green 

buildings in Singapore.  SJC achieved 

the GM-SLE with significant eco-

sustainability features geared towards 

the highest levels of energy efficiency 

and huge reductions in energy usage.  

Elsewhere, two more design-and-build 

projects – Bolloré Blue Hub and Veolia 

Singapore Office@Tuas View Circuit – 

were awarded the Green Mark Platinum.

As the outright market leader in 

the design-and-build of smart eco-

sustainable industrial developments, we 

are taking our commitment further to 

attain higher Green Mark ratings in our 

role as a developer for multi-tenanted 

developments that we intend to own 

and lease out in Singapore.  In line with 

this, we designed and built our global 

headquarters – Edward Boustead Centre 

– to attain Green Mark Platinum in 2015, 

leading by example and showcasing to 

clients how extensive green building 

features can be incorporated into the 

design of all future buildings.  Similarly, 

the same path was taken for ALICE, 

which attained the Green Mark Platinum 

in 2018.  In addition, our latest multi-

tenanted smart development under 

construction at Braddell Road is planned 

to have zero emissions across common 

areas.  Moving forward, we will continue 

to explore ways to further introduce 

smart eco-sustainable solutions into 

our leasehold portfolio including the 

introduction of the Green Lease Scheme 

at our multi-tenanted developments in 

Singapore.

In working towards the promotion 

of Green Mark Platinum-rated 

developments, our focus is on attaining 

high levels of energy efficiency, water 

efficiency, environmental protection, 

environmental quality and other green 

features.  Many of the Green Mark 

Platinum-rated industrial developments 

that we have delivered incorporate 

the smart eco-sustainable features 

summarised here.

3.3 QUALITY

Quality has always been a defining 

factor in the total client experience.  

As part of our Quality Management 

System (“QMS”) which includes 

quality assurance and improvement 

programmes, we first embarked on 

ISO 9001 certification in 1999 and have 

had a QMS in place ever since.  During 

FY2019 in April 2018, our major design-

and-build subsidiary in Singapore, 

Boustead Projects E&amp;C (“BP E&amp;C”) 

received an upgrade to the latest 

ISO 9001:2015 standard.  Our QMS 

sets out quality management system 

enablers, commitments, targets and 

responsibilities for our team.  Our QMS 

is both externally and internally audited, 

and ensures quality management 

performance at all workplaces and 

project sites under our control on a daily 

basis.

As the delivery of quality is emphasised 

throughout all potential client touch 

points, our solutions are not always 

the lowest priced among competing 

solutions but do consistently deliver 

high quality client experiences and 

outcomes.  Due to positive client 

experiences and outcomes, numerous 

clients have become repeat clients 

which is important in the context where 

almost all client relationships are 

business-to-business arrangements 

involving a smaller client base but larger 

transactional value as compared to what 

is typically seen in business-to-consumer 

arrangements.  The embedding of quality 

into all potential client touch points is 

extremely important since a client team’s 

project journey together with us typically 

lasts for over one year and is made up 

of thousands of interactions between 

key stakeholders, especially between 

our team and clients, strategic partners,

suppliers, lenders, government agencies 

and regulators, all within a single project.

3.3.1 Quality, Domain Expertise &amp; 

Project Track Records as Client Pre-

Qualifiers

Our clients range from reputable small 

and medium-sized enterprise clients 

to global clients including Forbes 

Fortune 500, S&amp;P 500 and Euronext 

100 corporations.  Given the strong 

brand reputation of our clients and 

potential clients, there are usually more 

stringent expectations on quality, domain 

expertise and project track records since 

our solutions have such a significant 

impact on the achievement of clients’ 

global growth strategies and their own 

relationships with their key stakeholders.  

Many clients conduct financial, quality, 

EHS and project track record reviews 

on our business and at times, those of 

our suppliers, before pre-qualifying and 

inviting us to submit proposals, bids and 

tenders for potential projects.  Once we 

become a pre-qualified main contractor 

to a specific client, we are routinely 

invited to submit proposals, bids and 

tenders for potential projects whenever 

the specific client reviews a potential 

new investment or project in Singapore 

and sometimes regionally.

In addition, BP E&amp;C is approved by the 

BCA for Grade CW01-A1 and General 

Builder Class 1 Licence6 to execute 

building construction contracts of 

unlimited value in the private and public 

sectors.  This removes the limit on the 

size of contracts that we can undertake 

in Singapore.

3.3.2 Construction Awards &amp; 

Construction Quality Assessment 

System

We are a regular feature at the BCA 

Awards, an annual awards programme 

hosted by the BCA to recognise the best 

in building and construction practices 

and projects.

During FY2019 at the BCA Awards 2018 

held in May 2018, we received the Green 

&amp; Gracious Builder Award (Excellent) 

for overall excellent environmental, 

professional and sustainability practices, 

an upgrade from the Green &amp; Gracious 

Award (Merit) attained in 2015.  

Separately at the BCA Awards 2018, 

ALICE received the Green Mark Platinum 

for its outstanding eco-sustainable 

features.

Shortly after the end of FY2019 at the 

BCA Awards 2019 held in May 2019, we 

received the Construction Productivity 

Award – Projects (Gold) for Continental 

Building Phase 3.  Separately at the 

BCA Awards 2019, SJC received the 

distinguished GM-SLE, while Bolloré 

Blue Hub and Veolia Singapore Office@

Tuas View Circuit received the Green 

Mark Platinum.

BP E&amp;C also continues to hold the 

Singapore Quality Class (“SQC”) 

certification under Enterprise 

Singapore’s Business Excellence 

Framework.  SQC recognises 

organisations that have attained 

robust business fundamentals and 

met standards for good business 

performance based on global 

benchmarks in areas including 

leadership, customers, strategy, people 

and process, knowledge and results.

To date, our construction excellence, 

productivity, quality and eco-sustainable 

efforts have been recognised with 31 

construction-related and Green Mark 

awards at the BCA Awards as shown on 

pages 28 to 29.

As a promoter of quality, we are a leader 

in the BCA’s Construction Quality 

Assessment System (“CONQUAS”), 

which is used to measure the quality 

achieved in a completed construction 

project in Singapore in respect of 

structural, architectural, and mechanical 

&amp; electrical works.  CONQUAS is a 

voluntary quality assessment in respect 

to most private sector industrial design-

and-build and development projects.

During FY2019, a design-and-build 

project, ST Omega 2 for Singapore 

Technologies Electronics received 

a CONQUAS score of 91.5%, while a 

joint development project, Continental 

Building Phase 3 for Continental 

Automotive received a CONQUAS 

score of 89.6%, placing them at 12th 

and 27th respectively on the all-time top 

100 industrial projects list.  To date, our 

efforts in construction quality have been 

recognised with eight projects ranked in 

the CONQUAS all-time top 100 industrial 

projects list7, making us the top main 

contractor on the list.  Our track record of 

10 projects on the CONQUAS is shown 

on page 30.

3.4 TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVES

With shorter business cycles due 

to disruptive technologies, we need 

to embrace transformation or be 

transformative where possible, in

“Embracing Industry 4.0 and Rediscovering Growth.”  The Boston Consulting Group, www.bcg.com/capabilities/operations/embracing-industry-4.0-rediscovering-growth.aspx.  Accessed 18 July 2019.

Nine Technologies of Industry 4.0



order to adapt to new megatrends and 

the prevailing global landscape that 

emerges over time.  In general, two new 

megatrends that are having a profound 

effect on the building, construction and 

real estate industries are Industry 4.0 

and climate change.

3.4.1 Industry 4.0

According to Boston Consulting Group 

(“BCG”), Industry 4.0 – the fourth 

industrial revolution – is a transformation 

that makes it possible to gather and 

analyse data across machines, enabling 

faster, more flexible and more efficient 

processes to produce higher quality 

goods at reduced costs.  This will 

increase productivity, shift economics, 

foster industrial growth and modify 

the profile of the workforce and 

ultimately change the competitiveness 

of corporations and regions.8   BCG 

went on to name nine technologies that 

are transforming industrial production 

as shown here.  We have overlaid our 

already implemented technologies in six 

of these areas.

For over two decades, we have been a 

pioneering force in Singapore’s industrial 

real estate sector, demonstrating 

pioneership and transformation in 

business model and activities including 

design-and-build (1996), design-build-

and-lease (2003), advanced eco-

sustainable buildings (2009) and IDD 

(2017), among others.

As the latest capability in our pioneering 

approach, our IDD platform deploys 

digitalisation and cloud-based 

technologies, and transformative 

methodologies like BIM, virtual design 

and construction (“VDC”), and design for 

manufacturing and assembly (“DfMA”).

These methodologies were extensively 

adopted in ALICE’s design, construction, 

project management and delivery, 

further complemented by our use of 

drones for aerial imaging, site progress 

and surveillance, and eventually ALICE’s 

marketing through the deployment of 

virtual reality technologies.  ALICE was 

constructed virtually using BIM and 

VDC (before the actual construction) so 

that most issues could be anticipated 

during construction, operation and 

maintenance, and proactive solutions 

could be generated, thereby significantly 

boosting productivity.  Another first 

in the industry, ALICE adopted large-

scale prefabricated bathroom units 

(“PBUs”) using prefabricated, prefinished 

volumetric construction (“PPVC”), 

moving beyond the norm of small PBUs 

in the residential sector.

On the operational side, an ALICE mobile 

app designed as a collaboration between 

us and a leading homegrown proptech 

firm, will be driven by big data analytics 

and Internet of Things (“IoT”) for tenant 

interface tied to ALICE’s smart building 

management system.  The single and 

comprehensive backend system for 

operations and facilities management 

will greatly automate processes and 

reduce manual tasks.  Please review our 

Industry 4.0 Future Feature on ALICE as 

shown on page 33, a taste of how we are 

converging the ideals of the Singapore 

Government’s ITP and ITMs for three 

industries: construction, real estate and 

infocomm media.  Simultaneously, we 

are using IDD and proven technologies 

to reshape smart eco-sustainable 

developments for clients shifting into 

Industry 4.0 under their respective ITMs.

3.4.2 Climate Change

Opening for signatures on 22 April 2016 

– Earth Day – at the UN Headquarters in 

New York, the Paris Agreement entered 

into force on 4 November 2016 and has 

been ratified by 185 out of 197 parties 

to the Convention to date.  The Paris 

Agreement brings together all nations 

in an extremely important common goal 

to combat climate change and adapt to 

its effects, with the aim of keeping global 

temperature rise this century at well 

below 2°C above pre-industrial levels 

and pursue efforts to limit temperature 

increase even further to 1.5°C.9   The 

Singapore Government ratified the Paris 

Agreement on 21 September 2016.

In line with this, we acknowledge 

that we have a shared responsibility 

as a responsible corporate citizen to 

work towards uplifting our business in 

material ESG topics, especially in relation 

to the building, construction and real 

estate industries.  Given the high energy 

intensity and emissions contributed by 

these industries, we aim to promote 

our smart eco-sustainable solutions as 

previously shown on pages 22 to 25.  

As explained earlier, we provide smart 

eco-sustainable solutions that have the 

potential to directly influence and reduce 

energy loss, emissions, pollution, and 

energy and water consumption in some 

of the most energy-intensive sectors, and 

work towards the extremely important 

common goal to combat climate change 

and protect our environment.  More 

information on our performance, policies 

and processes in relation to climate 

change will be shared in subsequent 

sections of this report.

During FY2019, we secured our largest 

contract in history and first Singapore 

Government GeBIZ contract for the 

S$242 million JTC Multi-Storey Recycling 

Facility (“JTC MSRF”), earmarked to 

achieve Green Mark Platinum.  JTC 

MSRF has been touted as one of the 

Singapore Government’s landmark 

projects to shift the nation increasingly 

towards the circular economy, where 

maximum value is extracted from 

resources through recovery, recycling 

and regeneration.  With extremely 

limited space and landfill capacity – 

currently confined to Semakau Island 

– the Singapore Government has been 

reviewing major initiatives to boost 

recycling infrastructure in the most 

efficient and cost-effective manner.  

We are proud to be participating in a 

national project of strategic importance 

in Singapore’s contributions to combat 

climate change, protect the natural 

environment and solve a pressing waste 

storage problem.

3.5 FY2019 ECONOMIC VALUE 

GENERATION &amp; DISTRIBUTION

Our continuous profitability every 

year has enabled us to maintain our 

generation of sustainable value and 

progress to key stakeholders, and 

reinvest in transformative technologies 

for long-term success and longevity.

In FY2019, S$243.0 million in direct 

economic value was generated, which 

was distributed to key stakeholders as 

shown on page 36.

We have built a fundamentally-sound 

balance sheet, reinvested in business 

expansions and our growing leasehold 

portfolio and continue to have the 

capability to make new acquisitions and 

investments.  Wholly-owned properties 

under our leasehold portfolio contribute 

relatively stable leasing revenue and 

profit that has gradually grown over time 

and provides a base to our financial 

performance, along with complementing 

our design-and-build activities.  In 

the future, we expect jointly-owned 

properties under our investments in 

associated companies and joint ventures 

to grow as well and contribute to leasing 

profit.

FY2017 was our first complete financial 

year following our listing on the SGX 

Mainboard in April 2015 and also 

marked our inaugural dividend payments 

to shareholders.  Since then, we have 

made annual dividend payments to 

shareholders, which has continued 

for a third consecutive year.  Our five-

year financial performance summary is 

shown on page 37.

INTRODUCTION

A PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE BUSINESS

An organisation is only as good as its 

people.  At Boustead Projects, this is 

absolutely true.

We are a knowledge-driven, business-

to-business and people-to-people 

corporation, where achieving our 

mission, vision and long-term objectives 

are highly dependent on the values, 

conduct and performance of our best 

asset – our team.

Our team is expected to demonstrate our 

five human-centric corporate values – 

integrity, professionalism, perseverance, 

flexibility and passion – in interactions 

with key stakeholders.  Developing a high 

performance team capable of delivering 

our engineered products and services, 

primarily smart eco-sustainable industrial 

real estate solutions (“solutions”) aligned 

with our fundamental principles and 

strong human-centric corporate values, 

strengthens our trusted partnerships 

with client teams at many of the world’s 

best corporations, helping them to 

transform their industry, build their next 

stage of growth, derive true value from 

their sizeable investments and deliver 

economic value and environmental, 

social and governance (“ESG”) benefits 

to their own stakeholders, while keeping 

us at the forefront of the industry.

A client team’s project journey together 

with us typically lasts for over one 

year and is made up of thousands of 

interactions between key stakeholders, 

especially between our team and clients, 

strategic partners, suppliers, lenders, 

government agencies and regulators, all 

within a single project.  As our business 

ambassadors, our team is the first 

ranking enabler of developing strong 

relationships with key stakeholders and 

the main contributor to our long-term 

success and longevity.  All systems, 

policies and processes (together “system 

enablers”) are there to support a high 

performance team capable of meeting 

the expectations of key stakeholders.

Being rooted in the deep heritage of 

the Boustead Group, fundamental 

principles have been passed down from 

generation to generation that continue 

to guide our daily actions and decisions 

today.  We believe in acting honourably 

in the way that we conduct business 

and staying true to our strong human-

centric corporate values.  We have 

zero tolerance for accidents, bribery, 

corruption, fraud and violence.  We do 

not condone the use of child labour or 

forced labour, whether at project sites 

under our direct control or project sites 

under our subcontractors and suppliers 

(together “suppliers”)’s control.  We 

believe in providing our team with fair 

employment and human rights.

This section covers our Code of Conduct, 

Team Development Programme, positive 

work environment and supply chain 

management which are mainly derived 

from the combined depth of three 

capitals – intellectual, human, and social 

and relationship – and ultimately deliver 

positive net effects for all six capitals.

4.1 CODE OF CONDUCT

We are highly committed to building 

a climate of fairness, honesty, trust 

and sincerity with key stakeholders, 

beginning with our team’s honourable 

conduct.  Our Code of Conduct (“COC”) 

sets the foundation for our daily actions 

and decisions, and helps our team to 

adhere to the highest standards of 

honourable conduct.

Our team members are inducted in, 

updated on and expected to adhere to 

our COC as a condition of employment, 

with orientation briefings when new 

team members join, followed by annual 

acknowledgements and reviews of our 

COC.  Policies on anti-bribery and anti-

corruption (“ABAC”), fair dealing and 

competition, proper use of corporate 

positions and resources, confidentiality 

and privacy obligations, insider trading 

and whistle-blowing are covered in our 

COC, among other guidance areas on 

honourable conduct as shown here.

4.1.1 Anti-Bribery &amp; Anti-Corruption

We have zero tolerance for bribery and 

corruption.  We expect our team and all 

third parties whom we have business 

dealings with to comply with Singapore’s 

Code of Conduct Coverage &amp; Data Protection Governance Framework Policies

FRAMEWORK

INTRODUCTION

Prevention of Corruption Act (Chapter 

241) and all applicable ABAC laws 

and regulations in countries where 

we operate.  Our team members are 

bound by our ABAC Policy regardless of 

whether they are employed in Singapore, 

stationed overseas or employed outside 

of Singapore.  We may also be required 

to comply with applicable foreign 

ABAC laws and regulations imposed 

in business dealings with multinational 

clients who are headquartered in a 

foreign country where we have no 

operational presence.

4.1.2 Fair Dealing &amp; Competition

We engage only in fair and vigorous 

competition.  We expect our team 

members to fairly deal and interact 

with fellow team members, clients and 

competitors, and not to take unfair 

advantage of all third parties whom 

we have business dealings with.  This 

includes avoiding abuse of confidential 

or privileged information, concealment, 

illegal conduct, manipulation, 

misrepresentation of material facts, 

undue influence or any other unfair 

dealing practices.

4.1.3 Proper Use of Corporate 

Positions &amp; Resources

We expect our team members to 

apply and use corporate positions and 

resources in a responsible manner, 

which broadly includes duties to act in 

good faith and in our best interests as a 

whole.

4.1.4 Confidentiality, Data Protection 

&amp; Privacy

Information is a valuable asset, 

particularly in our knowledge-driven 

business model.  In the ordinary course 

of business, we may receive clients’ 

confidential data, in which case we may 

be subject to various non-disclosure 

agreements and confidentiality 

clauses.  Clients expect us to abide by 

confidentiality obligations, exposing 

us to a wide range of risks from non-

compliance.  In addition, we have to 

comply with Singapore’s Personal 

Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) that 

requires organisations that collect, use 

or disclose personal data to abide by 

PDPA requirements, again exposing 

us to a wide range of risks from non-

compliance.

We are highly committed to adhering 

with all confidentiality obligations, 

applicable data protection, privacy laws 

and regulations in countries where we 

operate.  Our data protection and IT 

system enablers ensure that information 

assets are properly governed, managed 

and secured both in digital and physical 

environments.  This allows us to 

effectively comply with confidentiality, 

data protection and privacy obligations 

over the long-term.

In data protection, we have implemented 

a Data Protection Governance 

Framework (“DPG Framework”) that 

covers governance principles, structure 

and system enablers.  We opted for a 

governance structure with centralised 

formulation of system enablers and 

decentralised implementation of 

system enablers.  Our Data Protection 

Committee (“DPC”) comprising our 

senior management team, department 

heads and key executives has 

overall responsibility for the effective 

implementation of system enablers, 

while appointed Data Protection Officers 

(“DPOs”) coordinate activities.  Our DPOs 

also act as the external interface with the 

general public.  Other than our DPC and 

DPOs, team members are also briefed 

and trained to understand the PDPA 

and our DPG Framework including any 

department data and information flows 

that may require protection.  Policies for 

IT, information security, external data 

protection, internal data protection, 

document retention and third-party 

outsourcing are covered in our DPG 

Framework and reviewed by our senior 

management team and DPC at least 

once every two years.

During FY2019, we had no substantiated 

complaints on breaches of client privacy, 

which was the same in FY2018.

4.1.5 Insider Trading

We expect our team members with 

access to price-sensitive information 

to comply with Singapore’s Securities 

&amp; Futures Act (Chapter 289) and 

insider trading laws and regulations.  

Team members with access to price-

sensitive information are not allowed to 

trade in Boustead Projects’ securities 

on short-term considerations and 

in the two weeks and one month 

before quarterly and full-year financial 

results announcements respectively, 

ending only after release of relevant 

announcements.  Team members are 

reminded on a quarterly basis to comply 

with trading black-out periods and 

insider trading laws and regulations.

4.1.6 Whistle-Blowing Mechanism

Implemented in 2008, our whistle-

blowing mechanism allows our team 

members and all third parties to 

raise and report in good faith and in 

confidence, any concerns about possible 

misconduct in financial reporting matters 

or suspected bribery, corruption, fraud 

and dishonourable conduct.  Procedures 

are in place to ensure that whistle-

blowers are protected.  More information 

on our Whistle-Blowing Policy is available 

within the Boustead Projects FY2019 

Annual Report on page 66.

COC violations will result in appropriate 

disciplinary actions being taken against 

the violating team member including 

potential dismissal and referral to legal 

authorities for serious violations that 

may be illegal.  A compliance plan sets 

forth how our COC is to be implemented 

and monitored including how violations 

are detected, reported and investigated, 

as well as follow-up actions to be 

taken.

4.2 TEAM DEVELOPMENT 

PROGRAMME

The purpose of our Team Development 

Programme (“TDP”) is to attract, 

develop, motivate and retain team 

members with values, attitudes, skillsets 

and work practices aligned with our 

mission, vision, strong human-centric 

corporate values and high performance 

team culture.  Our TDP is structured 

to create a work environment that 

promotes creativity, excitement and 

growth, and make team members feel 

cared for, challenged, empowered and 

respected.  Our TDP sets out human 

resource management (“HRM”) system 

enablers, commitments, targets and 

responsibilities for our team, with 

implementation responsibility belonging 

to our Group Human Resource Team 

(“Group HR Team”) headed by our 

Deputy Director of Human Resources, 

a member of our management team.  

Our Group HR Team provides HRM 

leadership and support to all subsidiaries 

regionally.

We have always embraced diversity in 

our team, a trait we inherited from the 

Boustead Group.  This diversity has not 

just been in terms of gender balance but 

also in age, race, religion, marital status, 

family responsibilities, work experience 

and nationality, with a multi-cultural 

and multi-faceted team mainly from 

Singapore and other parts of South East 

Asia.

During FY2019, our overall team size 

grew 52% or 73 team members on a net 

basis to 214 team members, compared 

to 141 team members in FY2018, the 

breakdown as shown here.

4.2.1 Talent Attraction

As part of our TDP, we are highly 

committed to complying with

which is essential to attracting the 

right talent to contribute to our long-

term success and longevity.  Our team 

members are considered to be employed 

by us only within the context and terms 

of their employment contracts.

a) The Employers’ Pledge of Fair 

Employment Practices

Singapore’s Tripartite Alliance for 

Fair &amp; Progressive Employment 

Practices (“TAFEP”) promotes the 

adoption of fair, responsible and 

progressive employment practices 

among employers, employees and the 

general public. Boustead Services, 

the management services arm of the 

Boustead Group under Boustead 

Singapore Limited is one of over 7,000 

signatories to the TAFEP’s Employers’ 

Pledge of Fair Employment Practices 

(“Pledge”)1 and is also a member of 

the Singapore National Employers 

Federation.  Through Boustead Services, 

we are indirectly a party to the Pledge, 

adhering to the fair employment 

practices adopted by the Boustead 

Group.

Under the Pledge, we have committed to 

work towards fair employment practices 

including:

• 

Recruiting and selecting employees 

on the basis of merit, regardless of 

age, race, gender, religion, marital 

status and family responsibilities or 

disability;

• 

Treating employees fairly and 

with respect, and implementing 

progressive HRM systems;

• 

Providing employees with equal 

opportunity to be considered for 

training and development based on 

their strengths and needs to help 

them achieve their full potential;

• 

Rewarding employees fairly based 

on their ability, performance, 

contribution and experience; and

• 

Complying with the labour laws and 

abiding by the Tripartite Guidelines 

on Fair Employment Practices.

Apart from the Pledge, we promote 

gender equality at the workplace.  

In terms of talent attraction, this 

means that we offer the same basic 

remuneration package to all interviewing 

job candidates for a specific role and 

scope, regardless of gender or whether 

a job candidate has served Singapore’s 

mandatory national service.

b) Other Talent Attraction Practices

We generally advertise available 

positions both externally and 

internally, although recruitment for 

certain sensitive key positions may 

be conducted anonymously through 

professional recruitment agencies.  

Where possible, we seek to employ 

citizens from countries where we 

operate.  Since 2014, we have also 

adhered to Singapore’s Ministry of 

Manpower (“MOM”)’s Fair Consideration 

Framework that requires available 

positions – unless exempted – to be 

advertised on the national Jobs Bank for 

at least 14 days, thereby giving citizens 

fair consideration for all job opportunities 

before hiring foreign professionals to fill 

these positions.2

Adding to our potential talent pool, we 

are one of 10 sponsoring organisations 

within the engineering industry 

participating in the Singapore-Industry 

Scholarship (“SgIS”) Programme.3 

Launched in 2012 and co-funded by both 

the Singapore Government and private 

sector organisations, through Boustead 

Singapore Limited, we are a founding 

private sector organisation within the 

SgIS, a multi-industry undergraduate 

scholarship programme that aims to 

groom future Singaporean industry 

leaders in strategic sectors that are 

critical for the country’s development.  

To date, we have given scholarships to 

three individuals, all of whom have since 

completed their local university degree 

programmes and joined us in full-time 

capacities.

“C.1 Employment by Industry, 2008-2018 (December).” Singapore Yearbook of Manpower Statistics 2019, Singapore 

Government, Ministry of Manpower, Manpower Research &amp; Statistics Department, 2019, pages C4 and C5,  

stats.mom.gov.sg/pages/singapore-yearbook-of-manpower-statistics-2019.aspx.  Accessed 18 July 2019.

As mentioned earlier, during FY2019, we 

experienced 52% growth in overall team 

size, in sharp contrast to Singapore’s 

average employment at the comparable 

industries and national levels, which 

decreased 1.4% and increased 1.2% 

respectively in 2018.4  Our growth in 

overall team size was led by the hiring of 

131 new team members equating to a 

76% overall team hires rate, compared 

to 67 new team members equating to a 

50% overall team hires rate in FY2018, 

the breakdown as shown here.  Most 

new team members joined our design-

and-build and real estate development 

teams in Singapore and Vietnam, where 

business activities have been steadily 

increasing, especially in relation to the 

capturing of a record high S$633 million 

in contracts in FY2019.

4.2.1 Talent Development, 

Management and Retention

As part of our TDP, we embrace 

a holistic talent development, 

management and retention strategy. 

a) Conditions of Employment

We believe in treating our team fairly, 

with respect and an entitlement to 

human rights.  We offer conditions of 

employment and benefits that are in 

line with applicable employment laws 

and regulations, and prevailing market 

practices in countries where we operate

INTRODUCTION

• 

Reasonable break times, rest days 

and working hours, with overtime 

pay for eligible team members;

• 

Paid leave entitlements which 

depending on contractual terms, 

and applicable laws and regulations 

as stipulated by Singapore’s MOM 

or other foreign government 

labour agencies include adoption, 

annual, childcare, compassionate, 

examination, marriage, maternity 

and paternity, national service, 

shared parental, sick and 

hospitalisation, and unpaid infant 

care leave.  We may also authorise 

unpaid leave depending on the 

reasons provided and subject to 

work arrangements;

• 

Defined contribution plans in line 

with applicable laws and regulations 

as stipulated by Singapore’s Central 

Provident Fund or other foreign 

government pension agencies;

• 

Group insurance plans covering 

business travel, directors and 

officers liability, hospitalisation 

and surgery, personal accidents, 

term life insurance and workmen 

compensation; and

• 

Group medical plans and flexible 

healthcare benefits.

b) Fair Remuneration

We have pledged to reward our team 

members fairly and equitably based on 

their ability, performance, contribution 

and experience.  We offer fair and 

competitive remuneration packages, 

which may include overtime pay and 

annual wage supplements for eligible 

team members according to contractual 

terms.  On top of basic remuneration 

packages, team members also receive 

our payments to defined contribution 

plans.  Salary benchmarking exercises 

are also conducted to ensure that 

remuneration packages are equitable 

with what the industry offers.

There is a profit sharing bonus scheme 

for eligible full-time team members that 

is pegged to a predetermined formula 

based on our overall and respective 

subsidiaries’ financial performance.  

Individual bonus payments and annual 

salary increments are determined after 

each team member’s performance 

appraisal (“appraisal”) is objectively 

assessed by our senior management 

team.  In FY2019, we distributed a total 

of S$17.5 million in economic value to 

our team, a 12% increase over FY2018.

There is also a Boustead Projects 

Restricted Share Plan 2016 (“RSP”) that 

incentivises key team members to work 

towards department and individual key 

performance indicators (“KPIs”) and 

helps to align their interests with our 

long-term success.  Team members who 

are selected to participate under the RSP 

and subsequently meet their KPIs for a 

specific financial year may be eligible 

to receive Boustead Projects’ shares, 

which are vested and issued in tranches 

over four years.  More information on the 

RSP and earlier restricted share plans 

is available in the Boustead Projects 

FY2019 Annual Report on pages 51 to 

52, 60 to 62, 112 and 133.

c) Performance Appraisal

As part of our TDP, full-time team 

members are entitled to an appraisal 

at least once a year as part of our 

Performance Management System 

(“PMS”), with the exception of team 

members who are re-employed beyond 

the statutory retirement age, have 

resigned, are serving notice or under 

probation during the relevant appraisal 

period.  Team members who are under 

probation will receive a confirmation 

appraisal at the time of confirmation.  

Team members are evaluated on their 

achievement of quantitative department 

and individual KPIs and qualitative 

skillset competencies relevant to their 

respective roles and scope, which are 

defined and set at the beginning of the 

period under review.

Team members who consistently 

outperform are offered opportunities 

to take up higher challenges, while 

team members who underperform 

are assisted in identifying and 

addressing the root causes behind their 

underperformance.   Our PMS allows 

us to identify team members with high 

leadership potential, feeding into our 

Succession Planning System (“SPS”).

Whenever possible, we promote team 

members internally into available 

senior positions.  In addition, our Team 

Recognition Programme includes long 

service awards and specific achievement 

awards given to recognise project 

teams and individual team members for 

excellent performance in specific areas.

During FY2019, 71% of our team 

received appraisals, compared to 83% in 

FY2018, the breakdown as shown here.  

The lower percentage of appraisals 

conducted was due to a much larger 

proportion of team members who are 

under probation as our team rapidly 

expanded in the latter half of FY2019.

FRAMEWORK

INTRODUCTION

The significant differences in appraisals 

conducted by gender and category were 

due to team members under probation.

d) Communication &amp; Engagement

We encourage open communication 

and engagement.  With an open door 

policy, our team members may provide 

feedback or raise concerns with direct 

supervisors and our senior management 

team.  Appraisals also provide team 

members with an opportunity to 

provide and receive feedback on their 

performance and any other important 

matters.

As part of our communication and 

engagement, we organise townhall 

sessions on a bi-annual basis, serving 

as an organisation-wide communication 

session between our senior 

management team and team members.  

Townhall sessions are facilitated by 

external trainers and include team-

building activities to promote cohesion 

and teamwork.

We have procedures to address and as 

much as possible, satisfactorily resolve 

team members’ grievances.  This is 

complemented by our whistle-blowing 

mechanism.

e)  Career Development &amp; Training 

Opportunities

We have pledged to provide our team 

members with equal opportunity to be 

considered for career development and 

training based on their strengths and 

needs, and to help them to achieve their 

full potential.  We aim to nurture and 

professionally develop team members 

by investing in their career development 

and training, offering them growth 

opportunities through promotions, job 

rotations and overseas assignments.  

Team members can also upgrade 

skillsets and are generally encouraged to 

undergo professional training that may 

help their performance.  This includes 

sponsoring or subsidising the cost of 

approved career development and 

training courses, and may also include 

granting paid leave to attend these 

courses.  We also have an Education 

Assistance Scheme under which we 

may sponsor team members who 

desire to attend job-related courses 

on their own initiative and for personal 

development.  While we identify the 

career development and training needs 

of team members at least once a year 

during appraisals, we also assess such 

needs on an ad-hoc basis.

As we continue to pioneer new solutions 

and make investments in procuring 

and implementing transformative 

technologies, methodologies and system 

enablers, we have also made necessary 

investments in training team members 

so that they can realise the full benefits 

of these transformative technologies, 

some of which are shown here.

With technological advancements 

accelerating the pace of disruption and 

shortening business cycles, we believe 

that investments in training need to be 

adaptable, flexible and timely.

During FY2019, our team underwent a 

total of 2,241 training hours, compared 

to 1,141 hours in FY2018, the breakdown 

as shown here.  This equated to an 

average of 13 hours per team member

FRAMEWORK

INTRODUCTION

in FY2019, compared to 8.5 hours in 

FY2018.  Training was emphasised 

across our team, especially with 

newer team members – many of them 

at the executive level – in order to 

familiarise them with our transformative 

technologies, methodologies and system 

enablers.

f) Health &amp; Wellness

Other than earlier mentioned conditions 

of employment and benefits, we have 

also implemented team wellness 

programmes including sponsorships and 

subsidies for selected social, sports and 

recreational activities, health screening 

sessions and lunchtime health talk 

sessions.  In addition, other types of 

lunchtime talk sessions on various topics 

of interest have been organised on a 

regular basis.

During FY2019, our team members took 

a total of 240.5 medical leave days due 

to sickness or hospitalisation, compared 

to 321.5 days in FY2018, the breakdown 

as shown here.  This equated to an 

average of 1.4 days per team member 

in FY2019, as compared to 2.4 days in 

FY2018.  None of this medical leave was 

in relation to workplace safety and health 

incidents or occupational diseases 

among team members at administrative 

and project sites.

g) Employment Beyond Statutory 

Retirement Age

We may offer our team members 

re-employment beyond Singapore’s 

statutory retirement age of 62 years, 

as guided by applicable laws and 

regulations, and our policies on 

retirement and re-employment.  Any 

re-employment and extension of re-

employment depends on whether a 

retiring team member’s services are 

required, the team member is medically 

certified to be fit for employment and is 

able to perform at an acceptable level.  In 

general, we try to provide re-employment 

whenever possible, given that retiring 

team members have decades of 

experience and can still be highly 

productive and motivated.

During FY2019, we had four team 

members under re-employment beyond 

the statutory retirement age equating to 

2% of our overall team size, compared to 

no team members in FY2018.

h) Succession Planning

We recognise that having adequate 

succession planning is a key priority and 

essential to our business continuity.  We 

have a SPS for our senior management 

team and key executives.  Core 

leadership positions are covered by 

deputies or experienced potential 

replacements, who are identified 

through our PMS as being team 

members with high leadership potential 

to be developed and nurtured into next-

generation leaders.

At the end of FY2019, 100% of our senior 

management team and key executive 

positions – a total of 10 team members 

– were covered by a named deputy or 

designated successor.  Our Managing 

Director also had at least two named 

deputies or designated successors.

i) Termination of Employment &amp; 

Turnover

Our team members are entitled to 

compensation according to severance 

clauses in their employment contracts 

if we terminate their services.  Under 

all circumstances, we seek to ensure 

that any termination of employment is 

conducted in a fair and lawful manner.  

We have also implemented procedures 

to ensure that affected team members 

are properly compensated and may also 

receive job placements or other forms 

of assistance in addition to monetary 

compensation if we retrench them.

As with any corporation, we have not 

been spared from natural attrition and 

turnover of team members.  During 

FY2019, we had turnover of 56 team

members equating to a 33% overall team 

turnover rate, compared to 49 team 

members equating to a 36% overall team 

turnover rate in FY2018, the breakdown 

as shown here.  Our overall team 

turnover rate was slightly above market 

norms due to our rapidly expanding 

team, with some new team members 

leaving shortly after joining.

4.3 CREATING A POSITIVE WORK 

ENVIRONMENT

We are highly committed to creating 

a positive work environment, where 

our team, clients, suppliers and other 

key stakeholders feel comfortable, 

safe and secure within and around 

our operations regionally.  Our positive 

work environment is designed and 

organised to be conducive for delivering 

our solutions in a productive manner 

and facilitating interactions with key 

stakeholders, along with meeting 

applicable laws and regulations in 

countries where we operate.

4.3.1 Workplace Health &amp; Safety 

Above All

Of utmost importance, we care deeply 

about safeguarding the wellbeing of 

our team, beginning with our workplace 

safety and health (“WSH”) management 

performance and system enablers 

that apply to our team and all key 

stakeholders who are affected by our 

operations regionally.

From a WSH standpoint, the United 

Nations’ International Labour 

Organization has estimated that there 

are over 2.78 million deaths every year 

due to occupational accidents and 

work-related diseases.  In addition, there 

are 374 million non-fatal occupational 

accidents and work-related diseases, 

many which result in extended work 

absences.  The human cost of this daily 

adversity is vast with the economic 

burden of poor WSH practices costing 

an estimated 3.94% of global gross 

domestic product each year.5

In Singapore, although the incidence of 

occupational accidents, fatalities and 

diseases are much lower than the global 

average, the local construction industry 

remains a major contributor to such 

incidents, with the industry having the 

highest number of fatalities in 2018.

INTRODUCTION

As part of our WSH Management 

System (“WSHMS”), we first embarked 

on SS506 Part 1:2009 and OHSAS 

18001:2007 certifications in 2006 and 

have had a WSHMS in place ever since.  

During FY2019, our major design-and-

build subsidiary in Singapore, Boustead 

Projects E&amp;C (“BP E&amp;C”) received 

recertification under both standards.  

Our WSHMS sets out WSH management 

system enablers, commitments, targets 

and responsibilities for our team, with 

overriding responsibility belonging 

to our Environmental, Health and 

Safety (“EHS”) Team headed by our 

EHS Director, a member of our senior 

management team.  Our EHS Team 

manages all aspects of our WSHMS 

which is both externally and internally 

audited, and ensures WSH management 

performance at all workplaces and 

project sites under our control on a daily 

basis.

We have zero tolerance for accidents 

and are committed to saving lives 

through safe work.  This is encapsulated 

in our safety slogan ‘Safe Work, Save 

Lives’ which has become a daily mantra 

among team members and suppliers 

who undertake work at our project sites.  

Although we outsource construction 

trades to suppliers and do not directly 

hire any construction workers, we take 

responsibility to ensure their health 

and safety at our project sites and the 

general public’s health and safety in the 

communities around our project sites.

Through our Total WSH Policy, we are 

committed to:

• 

Preventing injury and ill health 

for our team, workers and key 

stakeholders at our project sites;

• 

Complying with applicable legal 

requirements and with other 

requirements relating to WSH 

hazards;

• 

Creating better health and wellbeing 

for our team, workers and key 

stakeholders at our workplaces;

• 

Providing sufficient and appropriate 

resources to carry out the 

implementation of our WSHMS 

to ensure sustainable WSH 

standards for our team, workers and 

stakeholders at our project sites; and

• 

Continual improvement in WSH 

management and performance.

Our WSHMS is supported by 

investments in technologies.  Internally, 

we developed an Integrated Boustead 

Online Safety System (“iBOSS”), 

which provides us with a centralised 

platform to manage all permit-to-work 

applications and safety induction course 

bookings.  Through digitalisation, 

iBOSS has replaced time-consuming 

administrative processes and provides 

us with data governance, traceability 

and tracking capabilities in documenting 

administrative and safety records.  The 

current iteration of iBOSS also includes a 

biometric facial recognition system used 

to administer project site access and 

security.

The tone for WSH performance is set at 

the top, where our senior management 

team ‘walks the talk’ when it comes 

to prioritising WSH issues and system 

enablers.  In terms of engagement, a 

monthly safety management meeting is 

conducted with our senior management 

team, EHS Team, all WSH professionals 

and project site teams.  Weekly safety 

management meetings are also 

conducted with our EHS Team engaging 

with respective project site safety 

committees and WSH professionals on 

safety inspections.  WSH professionals 

also carry out daily project site toolbox 

talks and safety inspections with the 

safety supervisors from all suppliers.

Specific measurable WSH targets are set 

under our WSHMS, which are tracked 

and reviewed at the very minimum 

during monthly safety management 

meetings.  While our perpetual WSH 

target is to achieve zero accidents or 

safety incidents at all workplaces and 

project sites, we also set short-term 

WSH targets to address adverse safety 

trends.  Our current short-term WSH 

targets include eliminating incidence of 

personnel or objects falling from height.

4.3.2 Continuous WSH Education &amp; 

Training

Nowhere else do we emphasise 

continuous education and training more 

than in WSH education and training, 

in order to immerse our team and key 

stakeholders in the right WSH culture 

and improve our WSH performance.  

Our training programmes include a 

Centralised Safety &amp; Quality Induction 

Training Course conducted for team 

members, suppliers and visitors to our 

project sites and an Enhanced Safety 

Induction Course in partnership with 

external training centres to provide 

safety training in relation to working at 

heights awareness for team members 

and suppliers.

Our EHS Team, WSH professionals and 

project site teams have the responsibility 

of ensuring that suppliers conduct 

appropriate in-house safety training for 

their workers before deploying them to 

our project sites and that such training 

is properly documented.  We also 

have a Safety Awareness Promotion

Programme that gives widespread 

recognition to the efforts of WSH 

professionals, safety supervisors, 

suppliers and workers in achieving WSH 

milestones.

Continuing our WSH performance in 

FY2019, we had no reportable accidents 

or safety incidents at our administrative 

workplaces, and zero fatalities, high 

consequence injuries and occupational 

disease incidents within our team and 

suppliers’ workers across our operations 

regionally, which was the same in 

FY2018.  Our accident frequency rate 

(“AFR”) and accident severity rate 

(“ASR”) at project sites in Singapore also 

compared favourably with Singapore’s 

average AFR and ASR at both the 

comparable industries and national 

levels.6

4.3.3 bizSAFE Mentorship

In 2008, we initiated our participation in 

Singapore’s Workplace Safety &amp; Health 

Council (“WSHC”)’s bizSAFE Programme 

by becoming a bizSAFE Partner.  In 

2009, we achieved the bizSAFE Star, the 

highest qualification that can be attained 

in recognition of a corporation’s WSH 

management programmes.

By 2011, we opted to take a national 

leadership role in advocating and 

promoting excellent WSH practices in 

the construction industry by becoming 

a bizSAFE Mentor; currently one of only 

eight bizSAFE Mentors in Singapore 

and the only one among our direct 

competitors.7  bizSAFE Mentors are 

corporations that have excellent WSH 

performance and track records, and are 

qualified and invited only by the WSHC 

to take this national leadership role.  

bizSAFE Mentors incorporate WSH as 

an integral part of their business model 

that benefits the wider community and 

also actively work with the WSHC to 

promote the WSH agenda on various 

industry and national platforms.  As a 

bizSAFE Mentor, we have been one 

of the key contributors in helping the 

bizSAFE Community to expand from 

10,000 corporations in 2011 to almost 

30,000 corporations in 2017.8

impacts and risks associated with our 

supply chain.  Supplier-related impacts 

and risks are identified, addressed 

and managed under our various 

management systems, Enterprise Risk 

Management Framework, internal 

controls, and external and internal audits.

Our procurement includes products and 

services from a network of suppliers 

regionally based on a list of approved 

suppliers for various construction 

equipment services, materials and 

trade services.  Supplier costs and 

other construction costs typically make 

up more than 90% of our total cost of 

sales.  In FY2019, we distributed a total 

of S$187.4 million in economic value to 

suppliers, a 26% increase over FY2018.

Operationally, we manage our 

procurement through our procurement 

system enablers and list of approved 

suppliers, which are subject to regular 

review as well as external and internal 

audits.

INTRODUCTION

PLANET EARTH

For all global stakeholders and all known 

life, Earth is our collective home and 

the only home we know.  Nature in all 

forms – both organic and inorganic – is 

the nurturer and provider of all that is 

necessary to sustain life.  Over the past 

200 years, the world’s population has 

grown exponentially with one billion 

people1 when the Boustead Group was 

first established in 1828 to 7.7 billion 

people today and an expected 8.5 billion 

people by 2030.2   This has placed 

tremendous resource strains on our 

planet’s natural ecosystem.

Furthermore, close to four billion people 

live in urban centres and this is expected 

to increase to five billion people by 2030.  

Rapid urbanisation will lead to enormous 

challenges in government planning 

across all infrastructure, economic and 

environmental, social and governance 

(“ESG”) facets.  Simultaneously, climate 

change – driven by greenhouse gas 

emissions contributed by human 

activities and agreed upon by 97% of 

actively publishing climate scientists3  – 

continues to result in natural disasters 

and extreme weather events that have 

disrupted national economies and 

hurt lives, people, communities and 

countries.4 

Accompanying expected rapid 

urbanisation, construction activities 

for infrastructure will continue to grow.  

As a responsible corporate citizen, we 

plan to do our part in minimising our 

ecological footprint and contributing to 

ESG initiatives that transit beyond our 

organisational ecosystem to our planet’s 

natural ecosystem.

This section covers our environmental 

stewardship, legal and regulatory 

compliance, and community 

development, which are derived from 

the combined depth of all six capitals 

– financial, manufactured, intellectual, 

human, social and relationship, and 

natural – and ultimately deliver positive 

net effects for all six capitals.

5.1 ENVIRONMENTAL 

STEWARDSHIP

Construction activities and buildings 

exert considerable impact on the 

environment during their multi-decade 

building lifecycles from the embodied 

energy of materials and construction to 

the operating energy of operations and 

maintenance, and finally demolishment 

at the end of buildings’ useful lives.  This 

also presents significant opportunities 

to mitigate ecological footprints of 

construction activities and buildings in

general.  Earlier, we shared on pages 

22 to 25 about how our smart eco-

sustainable solutions have the potential 

to directly influence and reduce energy 

loss, emissions, pollution, and energy 

and water consumption in some of the 

most energy-intensive sectors, and 

work towards the extremely important 

planetary goal to combat climate change.  

Under this part of environmental 

stewardship, we will share our processes 

in environmental management.

5.1.1 Environmental Management

We are highly committed to complying 

with all applicable environmental laws 

and regulations in countries where we 

operate.  As part of our Environmental 

Management System (“EMS”) aimed 

at protecting the environment and 

preventing pollution at our operations 

regionally, we first embarked on ISO 

14001 certification in 2006 and have 

had an EMS in place ever since.  During 

FY2019, our major design-and-build 

subsidiary in Singapore, Boustead 

Projects E&amp;C (“BP E&amp;C”) received an 

upgraded certification to the latest 

ISO 14001:2015 standard.  Our EMS 

sets out environmental management 

system enablers, commitments, targets 

and responsibilities for our team, with 

overriding responsibility belonging to 

our Environmental, Health and Safety 

(“EHS”) Team headed by our EHS 

Director.  This same team also oversees 

WSH performance.  Our EHS Team 

manages all aspects of our EMS which 

is both externally and internally audited, 

and ensures environmental management 

performance at all workplaces and 

project sites under our control on a daily 

basis.

We are also committed to raising 

environmental awareness through our 

adoption of green practices.

5.1.2 Green &amp; Gracious Builder 

Scheme

We are a voluntary participant in the 

Building &amp; Construction Authority 

(“BCA”)’s Green &amp; Gracious Builder 

Scheme (“GGBS”) launched to 

promote environmental protection and 

gracious practices during construction 

activities.  Having achieved a Green 

&amp; Gracious Builder Award (Excellent), 

we are committed to fulfilling our 

responsibility to the environment and the 

general public in terms of addressing 

environmental concerns and mitigating 

potential inconveniences to the general 

public in construction activities.  Our 

Green &amp; Gracious Programme (“GGP”) 

is a subset of our EMS and sets out how 

we should fulfil our role as a Green &amp; 

Gracious Builder. 

Under the GGBS and our GGP, 

we periodically review and update 

construction processes and key 

performance indicators on ESG topics 

such as those shown here.  Increasingly,

INTRODUCTION

there are overlaps in ESG topics, with 

fulfilment in one area contributing to 

benefits in the other areas.

Our GGP includes monitoring, 

performing and improving on internally 

set targets that cover areas such 

as reductions in concrete and re-

bar wastage, waste disposal, direct 

energy and water consumption from 

construction operations, effluents, dust, 

noise and vibrations.  Our targets are 

set at realistically achievable levels 

that are significantly better than the 

average performance of Singapore’s 

construction industry and national levels 

in these same topics, in which it was 

found that the construction industry 

contributed to in excess of 21% of all 

waste generated in Singapore in 2018.  

Although eventually 99% of construction 

waste generated and 60% of Singapore’s 

waste generated were recycled5, it 

is more important to reduce waste 

generation before the recycling phase 

since national resources – albeit a lower 

quantum – are still required for recycling 

activities. We also require potential 

new subcontractors and suppliers 

(together “suppliers”) to be evaluated 

on their reputation, financial health, 

operations, quality and EHS performance 

for inclusion on our list of approved 

suppliers, with approved suppliers being 

inducted in our GGP.

Due care is taken to ensure that 

businesses, residents and visitors 

within communities neighbouring our 

project sites are communicated to and 

not unnecessarily inconvenienced by 

ongoing projects.  These efforts include 

keeping our project sites clean and 

organised, protecting pathways and 

sidewalks that run along project sites, 

minimising dust, noise and vibrations, 

and putting up communications and 

signages where appropriate including 

ways to contact us should there be any 

major inconveniences.

During FY2019, we met all targets in 

terms of reducing concrete, re-bar 

wastage and waste disposal costs.

For our commendable efforts and 

improvements under the GGBS, during 

FY2019 at the BCA Awards 2018 held 

in May 2018, we received the Green 

&amp; Gracious Builder Award (Excellent) 

for overall excellent environmental, 

professional and sustainability practices, 

an upgrade from the Green &amp; Gracious 

Builder Award (Merit) attained in 2015.

5.1.3 Energy &amp; Water Efficiency

We have worked hard to improve the 

energy and water efficiency of our 

operations regionally in order to optimise 

the use of natural resources and mitigate 

our ecological footprint.  Improving 

energy and water efficiency has also 

translated to lower operating costs and 

conversely higher profitability.  Such 

gains have been achieved in two areas of 

our operations: during the construction 

phase of design-and-build projects 

and during the operational phase of 

multi-tenanted buildings that we have 

developed and continue to own and 

lease out.

Our design-and-build projects use 

diesel as a fuel for onsite diesel power 

generators, electricity drawn from the 

national power grid and water drawn 

from the national water network.  We 

also collect rainwater which is treated 

and recycled for use in activities such as 

project site cleanliness and washing of 

vehicles leaving project sites.

During FY2019, we measured our 

average energy and water intensity per 

square metre (“sq m”) of constructed 

gross floor area (“GFA”) – not including 

recycled water – for all significant 

design-and-build projects in Singapore 

as shown here.  While FY2019 drastically 

varied from FY2018, this was due 

to the timing of design-and-build 

projects in various phases.  It would be 

recommended that the average of two 

years is used for a more accurate gauge 

of this measure.  In addition, it should be 

noted that in 2018, Singapore’s annual 

total rainfall was measured as being 

21% below the 1981 to 2010 long-term 

average6 and 17% below 20177, meaning 

that our rainwater collection and 

recycling points at both design-and-build 

project sites and leasehold properties 

with rainwater harvesting systems 

used for landscape irrigation and toilet 

flushing, were collecting significantly 

less rainwater for recycling in 2018, 

resulting in more water being drawn 

from the national water network.

Our administrative workplaces regionally 

and multi-tenanted developments in our 

leasehold portfolio draw on electricity 

from the national power grid and water 

from the national water network.

Our global headquarters is Edward 

Boustead Centre, a Green Mark 

Platinum–rated development with a high 

efficiency building envelope design and 

some of the highest ratings in energy 

and water efficiency.  In terms of energy 

efficiency, Edward Boustead Centre 

uses double glazed low-emissivity 

glass to reduce heat flow into the 

building, more efficient T5 lighting, 

motion sensors that activate lighting at

staircases and toilets, and a signature 

central skywell that allows plenty of 

natural lighting to penetrate even central 

areas of the building.  In terms of water 

efficiency, Edward Boustead Centre 

uses extremely efficient water fittings 

and has a rainwater harvesting system 

to recycle captured rainwater towards 

water-intensive horticultural and toilet 

flushing purposes.  Edward Boustead 

Centre also has air handling unit 

condensate recycling, sky terraces and 

a rooftop garden to reduce heat island 

effects, which together with the earlier 

mentioned green features result in 

estimated carbon dioxide savings of 264 

tonnes annually, equivalent to removing 

the emissions of 56 cars for a year.

Our latest completed multi-tenanted 

development is ALICE@Mediapolis 

(“ALICE”), a Green Mark Platinum-

rated development which is also 

Singapore’s first truly smart business 

park development.  In terms of energy 

efficiency, ALICE uses double glazed 

low-emissivity glass to reduce heat 

flow into the building, a full LED lighting 

system, motion sensors that activate 

lighting at staircases and toilets, variable 

voltage variable frequency lifts with sleep 

mode feature, a daylight design for the 

atrium, a 100 kilowatt-peak rooftop solar 

panel array and sub-metering systems 

that can be accessed real-time on a 

mobile app so that individual tenants can 

keep track of all types of utilities usage.

FRAMEWORK

INTRODUCTION

In terms of water efficiency, ALICE uses 

extremely efficient water fittings and has 

a rainwater harvesting system to recycle 

captured rainwater towards water-

intensive horticultural and toilet flushing 

purposes.  80% of ALICE’s constructed 

floor area used greener building 

methodologies including prefabricated 

building systems and prefabricated 

volumetric construction (“PPVC”) toilets, 

the first large-scale PPVC toilets outside 

of the residential real estate sector.  

ALICE also accesses district cooling to 

gain greater efficiencies and has several 

sky terraces to reduce heat island 

effects, which together with the earlier 

mentioned green features result in 

estimated carbon dioxide savings of 842 

tonnes annually, equivalent to removing 

the emissions of 179 cars for a year.

We actively track the electricity 

consumption at all administrative 

workplaces regionally to provide a 

baseline for comparison against our 

future usage.  In terms of multi-tenanted 

developments within our leasehold 

portfolio constructed after the launch 

of mandatory submission under the 

BCA’s Green Mark Programme in 2008, 

only Edward Boustead Centre was fully 

operational for the whole of FY2019.  

ALICE received its temporary occupation 

permit at the end of October 2018 and 

hence was only fully operational for less 

than half of FY2019.  We do not track 

the energy and water usage at other 

properties within our leasehold portfolio 

as they are mainly single-tenanted 

properties and hence, energy and water 

usage is driven by clients’ processes, 

which can significantly differ based on 

respective clients’ business activities.

During FY2019, we measured our 

energy and water consumption for 

administrative workplaces regionally 

as shown here and Edward Boustead 

Centre as shown on page 56.  Data for 

ALICE will be presented in FY2020 once 

the building has been fully operational 

for a whole year.  The energy use 

intensity (“EUI”) of Edward Boustead 

Centre continued to compare extremely 

favourably with Singapore’s average 

EUI at both the comparable buildings 

and national levels and is in the second 

best performing quartile for comparable 

buildings.8  The water use intensity 

(“WUI”) of Edward Boustead Centre was 

almost in line with Singapore’s median 

WUI for comparable buildings.9

5.1.4 Waste Reduction

Under environmental stewardship, we 

believe that waste reduction should 

be undertaken in both big and small 

ways.  We encourage our team to 

reduce paper usage and to reuse or 

recycle non-sensitive paper waste where 

practicable.  In FY2015, building on our 

green initiative, we adopted a paperless

electronic format for annual reports 

and in FY2018, further phased out CD 

copies of annual reports altogether to 

reduce plastic waste as well.  We have 

also digitised most of our previously hard 

copy-based records where appropriate 

and continue to use IT systems and 

software solutions to improve our data 

governance and productivity, which 

helps to reduce yet another form 

of waste – time waste.  In fact, our 

investments in integrated digital delivery 

and building information modelling 

(“BIM”) have significantly improved 

digitalisation and productivity efforts, and 

almost eliminated paper usage while 

drastically reducing potential human 

errors in projects where BIM is applied.

5.2 LEGAL &amp; REGULATORY 

COMPLIANCE

We are highly committed to fully 

complying with applicable laws 

and regulations in countries where 

we operate.  Often, these laws and 

regulations cross the boundaries of 

economic and ESG topics, covering 

almost all aspects of our business 

and are governed under the scope 

of different government ministries, 

agencies, statutory boards and 

regulators.

In Singapore, the main government 

stakeholders and regulators that we 

regularly communicate with are shown 

on page 57.  In other countries where we 

operate, we regularly communicate with 

government stakeholders and regulators 

that are similar in scope.

Government stakeholders and regulators 

give us our business licences to 

conduct our operations regionally.  

Full compliance with applicable laws 

and regulations cannot be overstated 

and is inherent in all system enablers.  

Relevant on-the-job training is provided 

to team members to ensure that they 

comprehend and meet the requirements 

of laws and regulations that apply to their 

job scopes.  In addition, professional 

training may also be extended to 

specific team members in order for 

them to better comprehend and meet 

the requirements of applicable laws and 

regulations in high-risk economic and 

ESG topics.  Other than government 

stakeholders and regulators, we may at 

times also have to comply with laws and 

regulations embedded within contractual 

terms set by clients and lenders, who 

have to ensure compliance with laws 

and regulations which are specific to 

their industries.

In FY2019, we had zero significant fines 

or cases brought against us through 

dispute resolution mechanisms by 

government stakeholders and regulators 

in economic and ESG facets.  We also 

had zero substantiated complaints 

received from external parties and 

regulators or identified leaks, thefts 

or losses of customer data under the 

customer privacy area.  However, we did

5.3 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT

We are committed to community 

development and selecting an 

appropriate externally-managed 

community development programme to 

support on a long-term basis.  At times, 

we also undertake philanthropic fund 

raising through our own fund raising 

platforms in collaboration with our 

suppliers.  Communities in countries 

where we operate benefit directly from 

our donations both in monetary terms 

and in-kind to organisations that run 

community development programmes 

and also indirectly through the projects 

that we undertake for end-user clients, 

which provide jobs to those communities 

and ESG benefits.

During FY2019, we formally inaugurated 

our ‘Boustead Cares’ Community 

Partnership Programme with 

Singapore’s North East Community 

Development Council (“NECDC”), 

and helped raise S$50,000 in support 

of NECDC’s community activities.  In 

November 2018, we participated in 

NECDC’s Community Give Back Month, 

a platform for NECDC to bring corporate 

and community partners together to 

uplift beneficiaries in the North East 

District.  More than two dozen volunteers 

from our team worked with staff from 

NECDC and Bizlink Centre Singapore 

to organise a trip to the Singapore Zoo 

for Bizlink Centre’s beneficiaries.  Bizlink 

Centre is a registered charity dedicated 

to serving disadvantaged and disabled 

individuals in Singapore through training 

and employment.  The occasion was 

also graced by NECDC’s Mayor, Mr 

Desmond Choo.

In FY2019, we distributed a total 

of S$72,000 in economic value to 

community investments, a 140% 

increase over FY2018.  Moving forward, 

we intend to continue building on 

our ‘Boustead Cares’ Community 

Partnership Programme as a fruitful 

and uplifting long-term philanthropic 

programme after its successful launch in 

the past year.

5.4 CONCLUSION

Although we have achieved respectable 

performance in material ESG topics, 

we recognise that we can and must do 

better.  Having collected and reported 

on at least two years’ worth of data on 

material ESG topics, our Board is now in 

a position to consider setting medium-

term longevity performance targets in 

material ESG topics where targets have 

not already been set.  Hand-in-hand with 

our stakeholders, we intend to continue 

our role as a responsible corporate 

citizen, one which we hope to honour for 

many more decades to come.  Join us in 

this ultramarathon.

The Boustead Projects FY2019 

Longevity Report would not be 

possible without the efforts of our team 

who has worked extremely hard over 

the past 23 years and continues to 

emulate the efforts of tens of thousands 

of Boustead Men and Women who 

strived to deliver sustainable value and 

progress to multiple generations of 

key stakeholders and make a positive 

impact economically, environmentally 

and socially on the world over the past 

191 years.  We continue to live out our 

mission and vision for key stakeholders 

and in memory of the Boustead Group’s 

founder, Mr Edward Boustead and our 

fellow team members who have passed 

on or retired.  We are grateful to our 

former team members who ran this 

ultramarathon before us and are equally 

grateful to our current team members 

who chose to pick up the baton to 

continue running this ultramarathon 

today.
