Dear Stakeholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors (“the Board”) of Sunningdale 

Tech Ltd (“Sunningdale Tech” or “the Group”), I am honoured to 

present our third Sustainability Report.

In this financial year (“FY2019”, from 1 January 2019 to 31 

December 2019), the Board continues to integrate sustainability 

issues into our Group’s strategic direction and oversee our 

Sustainability Steering Committee whose purpose is to instil 

core values within the Group and a culture that reflects our 

commitment to the environment and society at large.

In the last Sustainability Report, our reporting scope encompasses 

our policies, practices and performances over the reporting 

period at our Singapore, Malaysia (Johor) and Indonesia (Batam) 

manufacturing sites. In this Sustainability Report, we have 

expanded our scope to include our operations in China (Suzhou, 

Chuzhou, Guangzhou, Zhongshan and Shanghai). 

The Board, along with various stakeholders, identified material 

and additional Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) 

matters in FY2017. Thereafter, we continuously monitor and 

manage these key ESG matters. This year, we conducted a 

review of our material and additional reporting matters and have 

concluded that the five reporting matters remain relevant and 

important to our business today. These reporting matters include 

Ethics, Bribery and Corruption, Occupational Health and Safety, 

Health and Safety of Our Customers, Waste Management and 

Material Use. 

Instilling Core Values Within the Group

Our financial and operational objectives are aligned towards 

constantly improving our sustainability performance. We are 

committed to upholding the highest standard on corporate 

governance and transparency with an effective risk management 

system to safeguard our stakeholders’ interests. Our Code of 

Business Ethics and Conduct serves to guide our management 

on business ethics and prevent conflict of interest. At the same 

time, the Group’s Whistle-blowing Policy provides an avenue to all 

employees to raise concerns and offer reassurance that they are 

protected from reprisals or victimisation for whistle-blowing in 

good faith. In FY2019, we maintained our zero cases of corruption 

and whistle-blowing incidents. 

Caring for Our Environment

It is our priority that the environment that we operate in has 

minimal risks and impact from our business. We ensure that our 

supply chain employs environmentally friendly techniques. In 

FY2019, we once again achieved our track record of zero chemical 

spills and zero cases of improper waste disposal. We have also 

managed to reduce both our hazardous and non-hazardous waste 

by 52% and 18% respectively.

We also continued with our four-pronged waste management 

strategy to ensure our waste is well sorted by its nature (i.e. 

hazardous and non-hazardous) and that the disposal methods 

comply with local regulations. The Shanghai Municipal 

Government implemented four types of garbage classification, 

namely – recyclable garbage, hazardous garbage, dry garbage 

and wet garbage. In response to the government’s initiative, 

Sunningdale Tech’s facility in Shanghai purchased new trash bins 

to comply with the new waste classification standards. We strive 

to comply and be in line with new regulations and governments’ 

initiatives in environmental protection.

Prioritising our Employees and Customers

At Sunningdale Tech, we believe that a diverse and healthy 

human capital is key to deliver better business performance. 

We strive to maintain a healthy and safe working environment 

and provide fair and equal employment opportunities to all our 

employees regardless of age, race, gender, religion, or marital 

status.  Sunningdale Tech is committed to an integrated human 

capital strategy which promotes fair employment practices and a 

safe working environment while fostering strong teamwork and 

employee development.

Our integrated Quality, Environmental, Health and Safety Policy 

guides us in surpassing our customers and relevant stakeholders’ 

expectations and adheres to the highest industry standards. 

On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organisation declared the 

outbreak of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (“ COVID-19”) to be a 

global pandemic. The rapid spread of the virus has caused major 

disruptions to worldwide supply chains, dampened economic 

sentiment and led to several countries declaring national 

emergencies while closing their borders to contain the outbreak. 

To mitigate the impact of COVID-19, the Group is focusing on 

tightening cost controls, improving productivity and enhancing 

operational efficiency. During this difficult period, the priority 

across the Group’s global operations is the health and wellbeing 

of our employees while ensuring the long-term sustainability of 

our operations.  

Sustainability will continue to be central to who we are and how we 

operate. We strive to put safety first in all we do. As a worldwide 

leader in precision plastic engineering, Sunningdale Tech is 

committed to protecting our customers whom we are pleased 

to serve. We will look to build upon our success in 2019, while 

investing in doing what is right for our employees, customers, 

shareholders and the environment.

Sustainability Governance  

As a global manufacturer, Sunningdale Tech manages our sustainability performance under the governance of our 

Sustainability Steering Committee (“SSC”). Our corporate SSC is headed by the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) who 

reports to and updates the Board periodically and is supported by site SSC within each operation. Chaired by the General 

Managers, site SSC is responsible for: 

• Executing corporate identified sustainability material issues/topics and recommending prevailing sustainability 

materials topics based on respective country laws to corporate sustainability steering committee for approval

• Recommending sustainability activities and/or initiatives to be undertaken within each operation, with consideration 

of impacts of company’s business and interests of shareholders, clients, employees and communities etc.

• Recommending and budgeting the amount of expenditure to be incurred on the activities undertaken.

• Reviewing the Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) activities organised, planning and enlisting CSR activities for 

the subsequent years.

• Appointing the CSR working committee.

To support our key management personnel in driving individual policies and practices within each operation, the 

Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) working committee is formed with representatives from various departments, 

such as Human Resource, Tooling, Information Technology and Business Development.

Materiality Assessment 

Sunningdale Tech conducted our first formal materiality assessment to identify, prioritise and validate our ESG topics 

in July 2017. In the subsequent years, these ESG topics are reviewed and re-assessed for their continued relevance and 

importance to Sunningdale Tech. 

This year, we engaged with key representatives from various operations in different countries and after taking their 

feedback into account, we concluded that our reporting topics remained relevant and applicable to our operations.

Whistle-blowing Policy 

Sunningdale Tech maintains a whistle-

blowing policy which provides channels 

for employees to report breaches 

and concerns that occurs within the 

organisation. 

Code of Business Ethics and Conduct 

Sunningdale Tech maintains a strong 

code of business ethics and conduct 

which guides the decision making of 

our employees in evaluating conflicts 

of interest.

ERM Policy 

An Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) Policy is in place to 

formalise the reporting, assessment, treating and monitoring of 

each significant risk that the group faces in achieving its business 

objectives. Such risks, including mitigating actions, are reported to 

the Board through the Audit and Risk Committee on an annual basis 

and are followed-up by the in-house internal audit team as part of 

its annual audit plan.

Ethics, Bribery and Corruption 

Sunningdale Tech recognises that strong business ethics is key to the success of our organisation. Any non-compliance 

case, regardless whether it is financial or not, may bring severe repercussions, such as impairing stakeholders’ 

confidence, incurring monetary penalties, which affects our reputation.  Therefore, we treat every non-compliance 

case seriously and strive to maintain a high standard of corporate governance and business ethics.

Sunningdale Tech has in place several policies for all employees and key vendors, as shown below. 

Figure 9: Policies relating to ethics, bribery and corruption

SUNNINGDALE TECH LTD

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

GOVERNANCE 






To ensure compliance with our existing policies and the relevant laws and regulations applicable to Sunningdale Tech, 

several practices and initiatives are instituted as follows: 













Whistle-blowing Mechanism

To encourage our employees to raise any concerns about possible irregularities, our whistle-blowing mechanism 

is established to allow employees to raise any actual or suspected concerns or issues without fear of reprisals or 

victimisation through channels such as telephone communications, emails or mails.

To oversee all matters raised from the whistle-blowing mechanism, a whistle-blowing committee (“WBC”) is 

established consisting of the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), Human Resource (“HR”) 

Director, and Internal Audit (“IA”) manager. The WBC makes the necessary reports and recommendation to the Audit 

and Risk Committee (“ARC”), for its review and further action. 

Internal Compliance Audit

To evaluate the performance and maintain a strong internal control on business ethics, Sunningdale Tech’s Internal 

Audit (“IA”) team conducts regular compliance audit to ensure compliance to internal policies, laws and regulations. 

At a quarterly basis, the head of internal audit provides the Board with an internal audit report. 

Control Self-Assessment (“CSA”) framework

To support our ERM policy and track the performance of our internal controls, our annual CSA practice takes place 

through the completion of a questionnaire in accordance with the organisation’s requirements. As a supplement to 

internal audit, the CSA results are reported to the ARC quarterly for review.

As part of our mandatory orientation program, all new 

employees are briefed and trained on the group’s Code 

of Business Ethics and Conduct, and the grievance 

channels they have access to.

Whistle-blowing posters are put up at all sites to 

increase everyone’s awareness on anti-corruption 

and provide channels to report any concerns or issues. 

All vendors are required to acknowledge and sign our 

standard Code of Business Ethics and Conduct form as 

part of our Vendor Survey Form. Sunningdale Tech will 

also conduct due diligence to ensure suppliers comply 

with all laws and regulations.

As a testament to Sunningdale Tech’s strong governance on ethics, bribery and corruption, we are pleased to announce 

that there is zero case of corruption and whistle-blowing in both FY2018 and FY2019. 

As at the end of FY2019, we have also communicated3 with 544 business partners on anti-corruption policies and provided 

trainings4  on anti-corruption to 19 business partners. Please refer to Figures 10 and 11 for FY2019’s performance on 

communication and trainings on anti-corruption policies. 

Figure 10: Percentage of employees who received communication on anti-corruption policies in FY2019

Figure 11: Percentage of employees who received trainings on anti-corruption policies in FY2019

All of our employees are communicated on anti-corruption policies through their acknowledgement in the annual 

declaration form which requires them to declare that they have read and understood the corporate policy on the Code of 

Business Ethics and Conduct and compliance with all regulations as stated in the policy. The policy is also saved in our 

internal portal which is accessible to all employees. Our new hires are required to declare and submit their declaration 

forms on their first day of work. 

Trainings on Code of Business Ethics and Conduct are only provided for every new hires during employees’ orientation 

programme. Due to a smaller proportion of senior managers and managers who are newly hired in FY2019, there was 

a lower percentage of trainings on anti-corruption policies to senior mangers and mangers in FY2019. Similarly, there 

was a smaller percentage of new hires in Singapore compared to other countries in FY2019 which results in a smaller 

percentage of employees who received trainings on anti-corruption policies this year. In Indonesia, majority of our 

employees are under fixed term contract, which results in a higher turnover and consequently new hires. This results 

in a higher percentage of employees who received training in Indonesia. All our employees are well aware of our policy 

through their acknowledgement in annual declaration forms as mentioned above.

5 As defined by GRI Standards, permanent contract refers to a contract with an employee, for full-time or part-time work, for an 

indeterminate period. Fixed term contract refers to an employment contract that ends when a specific time period expires, or when 

a specific task that has a time estimate attached is complete. A temporary contract is of limited duration, and is terminated by a 

specific event, including the end of a project or work phase or returned of replaced employees.

6 There are only two part time employees in both FY2018 and FY2019. Due to the small number of part time employees, the figure only 

illustrated full time employees by gender.

Occupational health and safety management system

Three of our entities in China have been certified with OHSAS 18001: 2007 Occupational 

Health and Safety Management System. Each site has their occupational health and 

safety management committee involving OHS representatives from each department, 

safety engineers and safety officers. 

Hazard identification, risk assessment and incident investigation

Work-related hazards and risks are identified based on our hazard identification 

and evaluation of control procedures and are reviewed at least annually. To ensure 

continuous improvement of our system, we periodically review our current policies 

and targets, implement preventive and corrective actions for any findings from 

internal audits using hierarchy of controls. We also proactively lower the Likelihood, 

Exposure and Consequences (“LEC”) scores for major hazards using the plan–do–

check–act (“PDCA”) method. 

Worker participation, consultation, and communication on occupational health and 

safety 

We communicate OHS regulations and policies during the signing of contracts and 

provide training for everyone. Internal and external communication management 

control procedures allow our workers to report any potential hazards while being 

protected from reprisal through corporate whistle-blowing policies. 

Occupational health services and promotion of worker health

We provide medical insurances for our employees and we have arranged several 

actitivities, such as sports and medical checks for our employees to ensure their 

health at work.

Hazard identification, risk assessment and incident investigation

Risk assessment and job safety aspect analysis are carried out for every department 

to identify and assess worked-related hazards and health issues. Aspects and 

hazards identified in risk assessment are reviewed at least once every two years or 

if there are any significant operational changes or incidents. Corrective actions and 

review of job safety aspects are required for every occurrence of accident or incident. 

Worker participation, consultation, and communication on occupational health and 

safety 

We encourage everyone to be engaged in our occupational health and safety process. 

Workers can inform Head of Department (“HOD”) or safety officers for any potential 

hazards. We also provide internal trainings, organised EHS weeks and quiz and table 

top exercise to improve health and safety awareness to our people. At the same time, 

OHS related issues or feedback are communicated through toolbox meetings and 

EHS committee meetings. 

Occupational health services and promotion of worker health

All our employees are free to visit any outpatient clinic and/or hospitals and are 

allowed to go for these medical consultations during working hours.

To maintain good occupational health and safety (“OHS”) working environment in our activities, we implemented 

country-level practices in accordance with local and regional regulations and laws.

Worker participation, consultation, and communication on occupational health and 

safety 

The EHS and Emergency Response Team (“ERT”) are responsible for overseeing 

OHS related issues and workers can report hazards to our safety committee. Any 

work-related incident and safety precautions will be shared to workers through tool 

box meeting to prevent reoccurrence. Incidents and health services available will 

also be posted on the notice board.

yearly management review meeting, EHS committee meeting and EHS monthly 

inspection. 

Hazard identification, risk assessment and incident investigation &amp; Worker 

participation, consultation, and communication on occupational health and safety 

Our EHS committee include General Managers (“GM”), HR, safety officer and 

representatives such as HOD or supervisors. Trainings and yearly job safety analysis 

(“JSA”) are conducted by HOD and EHS officers. During work activities, all employees 

are also briefed on JSA and its application. Employees can report directly to the 

supervisor/department person-in-charge or through suggestion box on hazards or 

hazardous situation. The supervisor shall report to the safety officer and the EHS 

chairman immediately, followed by the logging of an accident/incident investigation 

report. The safety officer/EHS Committee will review, investigate and suggest 

corrective actions to be taken using the hierarchy of control.

Occupational health services and promotion of worker health

We provide panel clinics and insurance coverage (SOCSO) for employees. Our 

panel clinics provide medical health services to treat common illnesses and where 

necessary, refer patients to government hospital for further treatment. SOCSO 

provides temporary disablement and permanent disablement benefits, including the 

cost for medical treatment.

Case Study: Occupational health and safety programs  

Due to the nature of Sunningdale Tech’s operations, it is our responsibility to continuously improve our employees’ 

awareness on workplace health and safety. Therefore, this year, we have implemented several programs in different 

operations to ensure these knowledge and skillsets have been obtained by our employees. These programs include 

Occupational Health and Safety trainings and EHS awareness week as shown below.

Occupational health and safety trainings

EHS awareness week 

Annually, our EHS awareness week held at one of our sites in Malaysia provides a chance for everyone to better 

understand EHS on site, giving back to society and receiving EHS services from the company as well. 

This year, we organised the EHS poster competition, safety and environment talks, blood donation programs and quiz 

sessions to engage all our employees in our EHS building.

In addition to aligning with local regulations, it is imperative that our employees have the knowledge and skill to react 

in case of an emergency. This year, we engaged doctors from a local hospital to conduct first aid training (left) and 

third-party trainers to conduct an emergency response training (right).

In FY2019, there are zero workplace fatalities, high consequence work-related injuries and ill health for both employees 

and non-employee workers8. There is also zero case of recordable work-related injury for non-employee workers9. 

The overall workplace injury rate remained almost the same as last year at 6.98 in FY2019 (6.95 in FY2018). For each case, 

we have put in place corresponding measures to prevent its reoccurrence. See Figure 19 below for more information on 

our performance for occupational health and safety.  

Figure19: Total number and rate (per 1,000,000 manhours worked) of recordable work-related injuries for employees

The main types of work-related injury include minor cuts and lacerations from machiner¬¬ies, sprains and traffic accidents 

during employees’ commute. To mitigate the reoccurrence of work-related injuries, we conduct briefing sessions to 

warn employees of the potential risks involved in their work, established our Work Instruction (“WI”) and update our risk 

assessment when there are new injuries. Sunningdale Tech takes every injury case seriously and we strive to take more 

preventive actions to maintain our zero-injury rate.

Case Study: Precision and quality control using CT Scan

As opposed to the traditional methods of Coordinate Measuring Machine (“CMM”) and multisensory measurement 

systems to measure the geometry of our products, our newly introduced CT Scan equipment is utilised across a wide 

range of our products – from plastic consumables to medical products to automotive parts etc. The introduction of CT 

Scan allows a three-dimensional analysis of internal features to pick out product assembly faults and errors, without 

the need to cut into the sample. It provides an overall increase in quality of inspection and decrease in processing 

time.

Case Study: Automatic test to ensure product stability

To automatically detect any potential defects and to ensure the stability and quality of our end product, we introduced 

Automated Optical Inspection (“AOI”) machine for testing of the equipment and system before mass production. The 

testing result will then be confirmed by each operation department, EHS department and third party for equipment 

maintenance. 

In FY2019, there were zero cases of non-compliance with regulations concerning the health and safety impacts of 

products and services.

projected to increase steadily in the years to come. This increase in waste generation has had a major impact on the 

environment and if left unmanaged, will continue to harm human health and their environments. In support of our global 

movement towards waste reduction, Sunningdale Tech is committed to some of the most effective waste management 

practices in the industry.

Sunningdale Tech has established an integrated QEHS and FS policy which acts as a guideline to all our employees. Our 

commitment to waste management is summarised as follows.

Figure 22: Policies relating to waste management

Most of Sunningdale Tech’s facilities covered in the scope of reporting has attained the ISO14001 Environmental 

Management System certification. To ensure an effective waste management, Sunningdale Tech’s four-pronged strategy 

aims to drive waste management practices and initiatives in a systematic and controlled manner.

ENVIRONMENT






For all Sunningdale Tech’s operations, we ensure that our waste is well sorted by its nature (i.e. hazardous and non-

hazardous) and that our disposal method complies with the local regulations. We have engaged a list of licensed waste 

collectors to dispose of different waste produced, including waste oil and coolant, contaminated rags, used chemicals 

which are used for testing by Quality Assurance (“QA”), plastic wastes such as runner and scrap parts, metal scrap, 

e-waste such as computers or laptops and other general wastes. 

While we include Shanghai operations in this reporting year, it is notable that the Shanghai government rolled out its new 

waste management regulations on municipal waste classification system – from the two traditional categories (recycling 

and other waste) to a more comprehensive four-tier classification system (recyclable waste, hazardous waste, residual 

waste, and kitchen waste). In respect of this, Sunningdale Tech ensures that we fully comply with the new regulations. 

Case Study: Waste bins initiative in Shanghai 

Since July 1, 2019, the Shanghai Municipal Government implemented four types of garbage 

classification, namely – recyclable garbage, hazardous garbage, dry garbage and wet 

garbage. In response to the government’s initiative, Sunningdale Tech’s facility in Shanghai 

purchased new trash bins at common areas to comply with the new waste classification 

standards. 

Case Study: Production tracking system on mobile device 

To minimise production error which leads to waste generated, the tracking system utilises 

mobile devices which allows mobile workers to obtain real-time visibility into business-

critical information

Case Study: Waste scorecard

To monitor our waste produced, we implemented an internal waste scorecard monitoring scheme which generates 

a graph on the consistency of waste disposal in our facility. Should there be significant rise in waste disposed, we will 

be alerted, and corrective measures may be implemented depending on the situation.

We have reduced our hazardous waste by 52% from 1,596 tonnes in FY2018 to 763 tonnes in FY2019 due to various reasons, 

including a change in injection machine oil at one of our sites in Shanghai, decrease in production due to a drop in painting 

business in Guangzhou, closure of one of our plants in Zhongshan, as well as a drop in sales revenue in Singapore and 

Malaysia. Our non-hazardous waste has also been reduced by 18% from 3,298 tonnes in FY2018 to 2,689 tonnes in FY2019. 

Our reused and recycled packaging waste10 has decreased slightly from a total of 21.4 million pieces in FY2018 to 20.8 

million pieces in FY2019.

Material Use

Sunningdale Tech acknowledges the cruciality of preserving earth’s finite resources and seeks to ensure that our 

operations are consuming resources in a controlled and responsible manner. Although we do not have absolute control 

over the type and amount of input materials (i.e. nature of the material selection being customer-driven), we occasionally 

provide recommendations on input materials during the decision-making process. In addition, with the increasing scrutiny 

of responsible use of raw materials by stakeholders, it is of greater impetus for Sunningdale Tech to be aware of our 

resource consumption and responsibilities as a plastic manufacturer.

Sunningdale Tech has established an integrated QEHS and FS policy which acts as a guideline to all our employees. Our 

commitment to material use is summarised as follows:

The following practices around material use applies to some of our production facilities due to the difference in nature of 

production.

Figure 27: Material use practices

 Additive manufacturing 

Also known as 3D printing, additive manufacturing 

allows the creation of three-dimensional objects 

one superfine layer at a time. This technique rids the 

need of cutting parts to meet the exact dimensions, 

therefore reducing the overall amount of input 

material use.

Minimising production material and 

packaging inputs

As far as possible, we have purposefully designed 

manufacturing processes to require less input of 

paint material and an improved yield in output. 

Packaging material inputs such as plastic totes, 

pallets and cartons are minimised by reusing them 

whenever possible.

Use of recycled resin (customer-driven)

Specific to our plastic manufacturing operations, 

we partner some of our customers to only produce 

materials manufactured from recycled plastics.

Hot runner system

The hot runner system ensures the material injected 

remains molten throughout the runner process until 

it enters the mold cavity, thereby producing less 

wastage and results in significant material cost savings 

if production quantities are significant. Although we 

offer both options to our clients, we would recommend 

our clients to opt for the hot runner system when cost 

savings outweigh the premium paid for the adoption of 

this system, reducing the overall amount of material use 

during the moulding process.

Crushing and reusing plastic waste during 

production

Waste in the form of defective parts or runners are 

recycled by grinding and reprocessing them to become 

fixtures that aid the lacquering process, thereby 

minimising the quantity of raw materials required for 

these fixtures.

Advising customers on material types

During 

the 

decision-making 

process, 

we 

hold 

discussions with the customer to agree on the suitability 

on material use and encourage customers who have 

the capacity to use recycled materials or materials that 

prove to have a lower yield loss.

ENVIRONMENT










In FY2019, our percentage of total recycled input materials over the total input materials has decreased from 13% in 

FY2018 to 3% in FY2019. As our input materials are largely dependent on customer requirements, we have limited ability 

in controlling the amount of recycled input material used.

Case Study: Substituting paper and cotton packaging materials with vacuum moulding material 

In FY2018, we have utilised 22,392 tonnes of recycled input materials in our production, of which are mainly customer-driven. 

This year, we optimised our packaging materials from layer pad and foam into vacuum tray. The new packaging has an 

increased capacity of 70 pcs/carton compared to 42 pcs/carton previously, allowing an estimated savings of $ 423.8/month 

on material and shipping cost.
