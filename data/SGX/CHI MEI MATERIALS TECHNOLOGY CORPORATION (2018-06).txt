various interaction mechanisms. 

















 2.1 PRODUCT AND SERVICE 

CMMT devoted to provide customers high quality products and had met relevant laws and 

regulations and contract specifications which in 2017 the following incidents never occurred.   

 

Analysis of production and supplier chain 

 

 

 

CMMT is specialized in polarizer manufacturing, main upstream raw materials suppliers are from 

Taiwan, Japan, Korea, China, and downstream major customers are panels and module plants. 

 

Supplier chain management: CMMT has certain procedures for new suppliers or raw materials 

import.  Collaborative evaluation by R&amp;D dep., quality management dep., and procurement 

dep. to confirm the usability and effectiveness of product quality during the importing process, 

in order to become qualified supplier. 

 

Supplier relations: CMMT establishes the “Operating Procedure for Managing Procurement”, 

and ask employees to comply with the “Code of Conduct” to uphold the win-win principles, in 

hopes of achieving mutual trust and interest and pursuing sustainable development jointly.  

 

Procurement objects: maintaining fine relationship with suppliers has always been the 

important goal of CMMT, to obtain stable quality of product and delivery has always been the 

goal, in order to accomplish this goal, CMMT highly respects the management and interaction

with suppliers, and uphold the win-win principles, in hopes of achieving mutual trust and 

interest and pursuing sustainable development jointly.  

 

Main materials and suppliers of polarizers 

For the time being, the main suppliers all come from Japan, and the market is monopolized by 

Japan-based suppliers. Notwithstanding, CMMT is used to maintaining fair relationship with 

suppliers and can satisfy the production need by supply sufficient materials. Recently, many 

domestic/foreign suppliers have invested in development of the related materials. This will benefit 

the safety of main materials supply.  For the time being, CMMT’s raw materials supply is 

considered well, and the source of materials is stable and reliable.  

For the raw materials TAC, PET and COP existing in a monopolized market, CMMT also continues to 

observe the other domestic TAC film manufacturers launching into the industry and test their 

product quality, in hopes of changing the upstream raw materials suppliers’ competitive structure. 

Domestic procurement  

Currently, domestic suppliers in Taiwan is 41%, about 9% purchase amount was domestic suppliers. 

 

Products quality assurance  

 Since the establishment, the ISO9001 and QC080000 management systems were certified from 

the initial stage of plant construction until now, CMMT has continuously promoted relevant 

management activities to establish, implement, maintain and improve management systems

continuously in order to meet the requirements of the management system. CMMT fully revised 

when each revision of international standards is required in order to achieve international standards.  

 

For instance: In 2009, ISO9001:2000 revised to ISO9001:2008. In 2013, QC080000:2005 revised to 

QC080000:2012 …et al. In response to 15th, September, 2015 ISO9001:2015 new version 

announcement, CMMT started revision program since third quarter of 2016, and revised 

certification in 2017.   

 CMMT upholds the policy and quality goal of “customer-oriented, continuous improvement; 

harmful substances reduction, creating corporate value”, reviewed by management team regularly, 

amended and approved by president, announced then implementation. In order to ensure all the 

quality activities of CMMT are conducted under controlled conditions and build mutual trust with 

customers so that they are confident CMMT will continue to meet the requirements.  

 

Product quality management and measurements 

 CMMT has conducted control mechanism into all the quality control stations from materials input 

to the finished product output point so that defective products can be immediately stopped that

Energy conservation and measures 

 

“Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act “was passed in 2015 in Taiwan, the carbon 

emission of enterprise will move towards the total volume control. According to 2014 “Energy Users Set 

Objectives for Energy Conservation and Implementation Plans”, energy users with contracted 

capacity exceeding 800kWh should have an average annual electricity saving rate of 1% or more 

between 2015~2019. 

In response to meet “Tainan City Self-Government Ordinance for a Low-Carbon City” and 

regulation of energy management plan of ministry of Economic affairs and improve the utilization of 

clean energy, CMMT plans to build up a solar power plant on the roof of our fabrication plant for 

self-use and electric installation in two installments design. First phase of the design is 411.84 kWh, the 

second phase of the design is 199.68 kWh, and total device capacity will be 611.52 kWh. The first phase 

was completed parallel power generation in September 2016 and the second phase completed parallel 

power generation by the end of November 2016.

All waste water will be treated by internal waste water processing equipment and Tree Valley Park 

Sewage treatment plant to process and purify. After the treatment meets the discharge standards, 

will be discharged into the sewage system by then. 

 Process wastewater and sanitary waste water collected by the plant will be discharged to water 

treatment equipment, recyclable waste water for recycling, and non-recyclable waste water will be 

adjusted by PH conditioning tank to neutral pH value and discharge. Regarding to waste iodine 

liquid, it will be concentrated and recycled by manufacturer, to improve resource reuse rate.

Currently, all waste is disposed by incinerators or landfills in the vicinity.  

 

 

Waste reduction measures 

Polarizer mainly produces waste plastic mixture, main difference will be iodine, which will result 

different treatment.  Although it will be harmless after burning iodine products, but still producing 

non-ferrous fumes which limits total monthly emissions. In respect of short-term treatment,

CMMT is located in Tree Valley Park, which is the first Eco-industrial Park in Taiwan. 

150 hectares of is reserved for industrial land in the Tree Valley Park which is total 250 hectares, and 

nearly 22 hectares of land is reserved for conservation and detention basins, moreover, the 

detention basins are planned as landscape lakes.  Tree Valley Park respects the symbiosis of 

ecological culture and human beings, More than 30,000 trees of Taiwan native species are planted 

and 100,000 seed programs will be promoted to create a world-class cultural landscape. 

 

First Tree Valley foundation and Archeological Center were established by industrial area in Taiwan. 

In order to promote the core values of ecology, history, culture and arts in the Tree Valley Park, the 

Archeology Research Center is set up by trust so that the rich archaeological sites unearthed in the 

Park can be preserved. 

In the future, Tree Valley foundation will create an open platform for people who share the same 

faith to participate. In addition to enabling the park to be financially self-sufficient, a series of 

activities planned by the Foundation will lead to greater public awareness and recognition of the 

land. As a member of Tree Valley Park, CMMT also actively responds to the planting of native tree 

species and also provides corporate land for archeological team to use, join series of charity 

activities and donation with Tree Valley Foundation.
