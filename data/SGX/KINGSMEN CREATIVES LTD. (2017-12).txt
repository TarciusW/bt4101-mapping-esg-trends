MESSAGE FROM GROUP CEO

It is our belief that sustainability is a natural extension of our business goals, 

and this report showcases our desire to effect positive change.

At Kingsmen, industry leadership is 

about sustainability in all that we do. As 

Asia’s leading communication &amp; design 

group, we are committed to innovating 

and driving business excellence for 

sustainable business growth. 

 

This first Sustainability Report covers 

areas deemed material to Kingsmen 

based on a materiality assessment we 

conducted, and we officially formed a 

Corporate Sustainability Committee 

in 2017 to raise awareness and 

identify sustainability opportunities 

and challenges. It is our belief that 

sustainability is a natural extension 

of our business goals, and this report 

showcases 

our 

desire 

to 

effect 

positive change. 

We align our long-term business 

strategies with our stakeholders to 

advance their interest, and through 

our business operations support local 

communities and connect people 

with new market opportunities.  

As 

a 

service-driven 

organisation, 

people form the core tenet of our 

business. Therefore, we constantly 

strive 

to 

empower 

them 

with 

relevant knowledge and skills. This  

is achieved through the various 

training programmes offered in the 

Kingsmen Academy. 

We are also aware that we are 

unable to realise our sustainability 

ambitions on our own.  Therefore, 

we seek the commitment from all 

our employees and business partners 

as we continuously expand our 

scope of reporting. This will be done 

progressively 

for 

the 

subsequent 

reports. 

With every step we take, we are 

closer to finding long-term solutions 

which will safeguard the future of our 

business and the communities we 

operate in.   

Andrew Cheng 

Group Chief Executive Officer

ABOUT THIS REPORT

With the support of top management, 

a sustainability reporting committee 

with representatives from different 

divisions was formed. A materiality 

assessment 

was 

conducted 

and 

the relevant information gathered. 

It covers the topics that have been 

deemed as material to Kingsmen’s  

key stakeholders.

Your feedback is welcome and you can 

reach us at info@kingsmen-int.com

REPORTING PERIOD 

&amp; SCOPE

The report covers the performance 

of Kingsmen and its subsidiaries 

(the “Group”) from 1 January to  

31 December 2017 (FY2017). 

As 

this 

is 

our 

first 

standalone 

Sustainability Report, we have provided 

limited historical information.

This report supplements Kingsmen’s 

Annual Report 2017, which can be 

found on our corporate website www.

kingsmen-int.com. In accordance with 

our efforts to be more environmentally 

friendly, this report will only be made 

available online.

Kingsmen has been reporting its economic performance in its Annual Report since 2003. 

Starting from 2018, we have published our first standalone Sustainability Report. This report 

focuses on the environmental and social aspects of our business operations and adopts the 

Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines at Core level.

OUR APPROACH 

TO SUSTAINABILITY 

Our sustainability strategy is driven by three key pillars of responsible business practice 

and aims to bring shared values and constantly challenge the way we work in order to 

achieve our business objectives:

We strive to be  

relevant in the 

marketplace &amp; generate 

profits to benefit  

our stakeholders &amp;  

the community  

at large.

We will create  

sustainable value 

for our stakeholders 

&amp; are committed to 

aligning our long-term 

business strategies 

with their interests.

We will continue  

to refine our 

sustainability framework 

and drive performance 

improvements around 

our key material  

issues.

Our vision is to become sustainably profitable, and we are prepared to constantly 

challenge the way we work in order to achieve this. Such thoughtful growth calls 

for the use of goals on sustainability that are rooted in our business ambitions. 

As a result, we use a set of Policies, Programmes and Standard operating 

procedures (SOPs) to deliver change on the ground. We track progress using 

budgetary controls and internal control procedures.

MATERIALITY 

The key topics covered in this 

sustainability report are based on 

the in-depth materiality assessment 

conducted in 2017. For our first 

Sustainability Report, we identified 

material 

issues 

that 

reflect 

our 

significant environmental and social 

impacts – on our performance as a 

business and influencing the decisions 

of stakeholders. 

The Sustainability Committee then 

made an initial prioritisation of issues 

deemed important and grouped issues 

of similar nature together. We invited 

members of our Senior Management 

and external stakeholders to rank the 

issues of most importance to them 

and those which they expected us as a 

business to address. 

This exercise resulted in eight material 

issues being identified which the 

Management, Board of Directors and 

Sustainability Committee have signed 

off on.

TRAINING AND 

DEVELOPMENT – 

KINGSMEN ACADEMY

We aspire to be a learning organisation 

with a culture of continuous learning 

to keep ahead of market trends 

and respond proactively to face the 

challenges of a dynamically changing 

landscape. 

All 

new 

Kingsmen 

employees undergo an onboarding 

programme, which exposes them 

to the culture of Kingsmen, a broad 

overview 

of 

the 

Company, 

and 

knowledge of their day-to-day job 

roles and responsibilities. 

At Kingsmen, “Educating through 

Engagement” 

is 

a 

working 

and 

practicable maxim that places training 

right in the career path of our people. 

To build employee capability, we 

have the Kingsmen Academy which 

focuses on the development of our 

people to reach their fullest potential 



OUR 

PEOPLE 

People are the heart of the business at Kingsmen and we strongly believe in 

sustainable employability. We prioritise talent attraction and retention, providing 

a safe working environment, investing in training and creating a fun and 

motivating workplace for our people.

Our 

human 

resource 

Policies 

and Code of Conduct cover fair 

remuneration, benefits, health and 

safety, 

career 

development 

and 

training and are regularly reviewed 

by our management. The policies 

comply with the legal standards in the 

areas we operate in.  

TALENT STRATEGY 

We aim to build a sustainable leadership 

pipeline of talents that will be nurtured 

to be the future leaders of the 

organisation. As part of our leadership 

renewal plans, we participate in 

the Singapore-Industry Scholarship 

(SgIS) 

– 

a 

partnership 

between 

the Government and Kingsmen to 

develop a strong core of Singaporeans 

to anchor strategic sectors which are 

critical for Singapore’s development. 

To date, Kingsmen has welcomed 

seven scholars on board where they 

will undergo two rigorous years of job 

training and career development. 

We 

also 

specifically 

monitor 

competency 

requirements 

for 

strategically critical roles, and maintain 

a look out for high-potential internal 

candidates, 

providing 

them 

with 

development opportunities.

and provide them with a fulfilling 

career with the organisation. As part 

of the Kingsmen Academy, we have a 

total of 13 unique Kingsmen courses 

across 6 distinct categories – Sales 

&amp; Marketing, Process Management, 

Service Differentiation, Leadership/

Management, Legal Knowledge and 

Finance.

The training curriculum is guided 

by 

our 

strategy 

on 

employee 

development and consists of various 

programmes that range from core 

functional competencies to leadership 

capabilities and life skills. These include 

on-the-job training and coaching, 

and 

the 

mentorship 

programme 

which provides a unique opportunity 

for identified employees to engage 

and learn from senior management 

through casual engagement sessions.

OUR 

PEOPLE 

LEADERSHIP  

DEVELOPMENT 

Delivery of our business strategy 

requires skilled leadership. That is why 

we have developed a series of custom-

made programmes, some of which 

have been developed in collaboration 

with 

an 

external 

partner. 

These 

programmes focus on expanding our 

leaders’ skillsets and fostering their 

leadership and management potential.

Our annual regional conferences 

are 

aimed 

at 

accelerating 

the 

development of a strong regional 

talent pool across the Group, and 

enhancing their abilities to execute 

and achieve transformation goals of 

the organisation.  The conferences 

are opportunities for future leaders 

to interact with different regional 

offices to gain new experiences and 

perspectives. 

TRAINING BEYOND 

THE CLASSROOM 

Behind every successful organisation 

lies a great team that works seamlessly 

together. 

Throughout 

the 

year, 

Kingsmen 

offices 

conduct 

team 

building exercises to strengthen the 

bond among its teams. In 2017, we 

held the bi-annual Outward Bound 

Course, where staff from the Group’s 

regional offices came together to share 

experiences at the Outward Bound 

School in Pulau Ubin, Singapore.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT

 

We hold regular formal and informal 

engagement 

sessions 

to 

ensure 

that an inclusive work environment 

is cultivated. To promote a culture 

of open communications, constant 

interaction is maintained between 

managers and their teams to monitor 

the well-being of employees. In 2017, 

we kicked off a new dialogue session 

series with the top management 

team to communicate and connect 

with senior managerial staff in more 

intimate 

settings. 

These 

sessions 

encourage attendees to share their 

views and address any concerns they 

may have. 

Our Sports &amp; Recreation Committee 

also organises various events to 

bring employees together outside of 

their daily work – from our annual 

Dinner and Dance to sports-related 

events, health talks and other special  

interest activities.  

WORKPLACE HEALTH 

&amp; SAFETY

We provide a safe work environment 

for our people and a workplace 

safety and health committee actively 

promotes awareness on occupational 

health and safety and raises the safety 

standards for employees. 

The 

committee 

ensures 

that 

we 

comply 

with 

all 

regulatory 

requirements, conduct safety onsite 

inspections, fire safety plans, and 

enforces safety-related trainings of all 

operational staff.

OUR 

COMMUNITY 

We believe we have a responsibility 

to improve the lives of those in the 

communities we operate in and focus 

on initiatives that will contribute 

where it matters and have a positive 

impact. Beyond corporate work, our 

community strategy is centred on 

supporting various social initiatives in 

the areas of art, youth and education.

 

Our focus on supporting youth 

empowerment is an extension of our 

motto of continuous learning that has 

become synonymous with Kingsmen. 

We hope to create opportunities 

for the marginalised youth through 

our support for the beneficiaries’ 

community engagement work. We 

also participate in other community 

initiatives on selective basis, ensuring 

that it is aligned with our community 

engagement objective. 

ONE FUTURE – NO HUNGER

 

Our Malaysia office took part in the World Vision 30-Hour Famine 

DIY camp – an initiative by World vision to raise funds for the 

underprivileged struggling against hunger and poverty every day. 

Through their involvement in the 30-Hour Famine, participants 

learnt about global issues affecting the poor through interactive 

and educational games as they find out how their actions can 

make an impact. Together with other like-minded people, they 

fasted in solidarity from 1st to 2nd July. 

“CREATIVE JOURNEY WITH HUMPTY 

DUMPTY, PRESENTED BY KINGSMEN”

 

Our Vietnam office initiated a campaign to benefit disadvantaged 

youth from selected social centres and orphanages in Ho Chi Minh 

City and its nearby areas. The mission was to increase creative self-

exploration by providing a creative platform for the disadvantaged 

youth and concurrently raise public awareness about the support 

society can lend to these young people.

Through a series of public activities, including a design contest, a 

charity walk, a pop-up store roadshow and a charity auction, the 

campaign raised funds to create and facilitate extra-curriculum 

activities for these disadvantaged youth such as painting classes, 

design courses, and sports events.

OUR 

ENVIRONMENT 

As part of Kingsmen’s sustainability practice, we embrace sustainability in ways 

that generate value for both our organisation and our clients throughout the 

planning and execution phase of our projects. We understand that our business 

processes can have positive and negative environmental impacts and our 

goal is to provide services that wherever practical, minimises the negative and 

maximises the positive longer-term impacts. 

SUSTAINABLE WORKING 

ENVIRONMENT 

We are a part of the global effort 

to sustain and better manage our 

resources and are constantly seeking 

ways to deliver more environmentally-

friendly projects. 

Some of our conservation initiatives 

include adopting environmentally-

friendly practices into our processes; 

and as part of our standard operating 

procedures, reducing energy as well 

as water consumption. 

Our Green Committee champions 

environmentalism within the Group 

and employees are actively involved 

in fulfilling our Green philosophy, 

by 

engaging 

in 

green 

practices 

within our day-to-day operations, by 

practicing the 3Rs – recycle, reuse  

and reduce.

 

ECO-INNOVATION

Our designers and project personnel 

advocate 

green 

design 

during 

the planning process and there is 

collaborative effort to seek ways to 

make projects more eco-friendly with 

the introduction of new innovative 

products and materials. We also 

consider environmental impacts in 

our recommendations to clients and 

during procurement. 

Our service offerings include the 

rental of more than 100 furniture types 

to reduce the material consumption 

at events. In addition, we also offer 

clients the option of recycling custom-

built booth components to reduce 

waste and provide turnkey services for 

storage to refurbishment after each 

show, extending the lifespan of the 

built materials. Modular systems such 

as Octanorm and Maxima are design 

solutions for booth structures which 

provide versatility and can be reused. 

Increasingly, we are exploring the 

extensive use of new technologies and 

materials to reduce waste and help 

our clients create unique experiences 

that create more value. 

We acknowledge that change is 

necessary but it is a long-term ongoing 

process, 

as 

these 

are 

practices  

deeply rooted in the industries we 

operate in, but we will continue to 

work with our business partners to 

raise their awareness and look to 

reduce our carbon footprint through 

innovative ways.

OUR NEW HOME,

THE KINGSMEN EXPERIENCE 

Our new home, The Kingsmen Experience, marks a new way of working – an extension of the 

Experiencing Kingsmen brand. Our new headquarters will be the home of innovation for years 

to come and it is a reflection of our design-driven culture. 

With a focus on flexibility and 

collaboration – to inspire ideas and 

facilitate creativity, our HQ is now a 

space for the best creative minds to 

come together to deliver the best in 

experience design for the market. 

Beyond just being an attractive work 

environment, it aims to be a breeding 

ground for fresh ideas and attract  

new talent. 

Located at the heart of the experience 

centre, the communal area CoLab is 

designed to tie individuals closer to 

the Kingsmen identity. When people 

meet, ideas spark and unexpected 

chemistry will form. The open-plan 

building with different work zones 

will give our people a greater sense 

of freedom and work in spaces where 

they feel most comfortable in. 

Unique 

touches 

throughout 

the 

experience centre will create a truly 

memorable journey for visitors and 

staff alike. It is truly an exciting time 

for us and we cannot wait to share the 

final product with you.
