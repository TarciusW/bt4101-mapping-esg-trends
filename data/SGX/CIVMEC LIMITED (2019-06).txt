ABOUT THIS REPORT

SCOPE

The purpose of this report is to enable key stakeholders to 

understand Civmec’s sustainability approach, actions, performance 

and key material issues for the financial year ended 30 June 2019 

(FY2019). This report was approved by the Civmec Board of Directors 

(the ‘Board’) on 29 November 2019. 

Civmec Limited (Company Registration Number 201011837H) is 

the ultimate holding company of the Civmec group of companies. 

In this report, unless otherwise stated, references to ‘Civmec’, the 

‘company’ and the ‘group’ refer to Civmec Limited and its controlled 

entities. The information in this report covers all operational activities 

undertaken by Civmec. Our share of operations from joint venture 

projects is reported on a proportionately consolidated basis, unless 

otherwise stated.

REPORTING APPROACH

Civmec’s Sustainability Report 2019 links our sustainability principles 

to our mission, vision and values. The report has been prepared in 

accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability 

Reporting Standards 2016 core-level reporting, which focuses on 

identifying and reporting on topics that are material to our business 

and key stakeholders, in relation to environmental, social and 

governance (ESG) performance. 

The GRI Standards create a common language for organisations and 

stakeholders, with which the economic, environmental, and social 

impacts of organisations can be communicated and understood. 

The Standards are designed to enhance the global comparability 

and quality of information on these impacts, thereby enabling greater 

transparency and accountability of organisations.1

We report our sustainability performance annually. To support this 

commitment, we are continuing to evolve and refine how we collect 

information to ensure quality data and insights are available in order  

to drive improvement in our sustainability performance over time.  

This process includes undertaking an internal audit of this report and 

the reporting process. 

For ease of reference, a GRI Standard Content Index is located on 

page 45 of this report.

CIVMEC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

MESSAGE FROM THE BOARD

The primary role of the Board is to deliver 

mutually beneficial outcomes for all stakeholders 

and to ensure that the company is managed in 

accordance with best international corporate 

governance practices, meeting all obligations  

of the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and the 

Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).

Central to Civmec’s approach to sustainability is our Never 

Assume philosophy, which underpins the company’s culture 

and drives behaviour, attitudes, decisions and actions.

As we celebrate 10 successful years of operation this year, the 

sustainability of our business over the past decade is intrinsically 

linked to the successful management of our environmental,  

social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. 

Proactively identifying and understanding the risks faced by the 

business and adopting sustainable practices to mitigate these,  

in addition to capitalising on identified opportunities, has facilitated  

our growth.

This report outlines Civmec’s management approach and 

performance across the key material risk areas identified, as  

a fundamental component of future strategy to continue to drive 

sustainable growth. As part of its strategic formulation, the Board  

has carefully considered the material ESG factors that present the 

greatest risk and opportunity to the business and oversees the 

management and monitoring of these factors.

Civmec’s sustainability agenda is focused on: 

• continuing to operate with integrity;

•  actively contributing to the success and welfare of our people  

and the communities in which we operate;

•  ensuring our operations have minimal environmental impact, and

•  achieving our safety, health, environment, people and financial 

targets.

Overwhelmingly, the company’s success relies on its ability to  

foster positive, meaningful and productive relationships with its  

key stakeholders, including employees, clients and partners,  

all of which play an integral role in our ongoing success. 

Yours sincerely

The Board

CIVMEC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

OUR OPERATING SECTORS – MARINE &amp; DEFENCE 

Our ability to provide the Marine &amp; Defence sector with a fully integrated 

service offering for the construction of Naval vessels and future 

sustainment, maintenance and repairs, and the provision of defence 

estate works, is underpinned by our multi-disciplinary capabilities and 

specialised waterfront facilities. 

Construction of our new Main Assembly Hall 

at Henderson progressed significantly during 

FY2019. 

Designed to be one of the most efficient and innovative 

in the world, the new facility is a significant piece of 

industrial infrastructure, adding a world-class resource 

to the Australian maritime landscape. The 53,000m2 

(usable floor area), 70 metre high ship and module 

construction, ship repair and sustainment facility will 

be the largest undercover facility of its kind in Australia. 

With crane capability at a height of 60m, the facility 

has a 400T crane capacity at 40m and will be large 

enough to house complete Air Warfare Destroyers, 

Frigates and Offshore Patrol Vessels, for construction 

or sustainment. 

Our extensive waterfront facilities and specialised 

equipment, on both the west and east coast, enable 

us to provide a comprehensive service offering for the 

construction, repair and sustainment of vessels. 

Our strategy is to position the company to be well 

placed to support the Federal Government’s initiative 

to develop Australia’s sovereign shipbuilding capability 

and their commitment to undertake the continuous 

build and sustainment of minor war vessels at 

Henderson. The delivery of the Royal Australian Navy’s 

Offshore Patrol Vessel program commenced in late 

2018, with the preparation and profile cutting of steel 

plates for the first two vessels currently being built in 

South Australia now well underway at Henderson. 

Through our core capabilities, we can also provide 

vertically integrated services in the delivery of Defence 

estate projects, including new developments and 

facilities upgrade and maintenance works aimed at 

restoring or sustaining capability of existing facilities 

and infrastructure.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND MATERIALITY 

The material issues addressed in this report reflect  

the priorities identified by our key stakeholders.

A materiality assessment was undertaken 

consistent with Global Reporting Initiative 

(GRI) Standards requirements. Members 

from key stakeholder groups, including 

management, staff, clients and the Board, 

were invited to participate in the survey. 

As expected, results were generally consistent 

with the FY2018 survey results, further 

reinforcing the topics for inclusion again 

in this FY2019 report. In determining the 

material environmental, social and governance 

(ESG) factors selected, their relevance to the 

business, including our strategy, business 

model and key stakeholders, was considered. 

In 2015, the United Nations agreed on  

17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 

as part of its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development. The interrelated SDGs are 

a blueprint to achieve a better and more 

sustainable future for everyone across the 

planet. They address the global challenges 

we face, including those related to poverty, 

inequality, climate, environmental degradation, 

prosperity, and peace and justice. As a 

supporter of the SDGs, we understand we 

can positively contribute towards these 

goals through our own sustainable business 

practices. The table following highlights the 

correlation between our ESG focus areas and 

the SDGs.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Maintaining open lines of communication with our key stakeholders,  

both internal and external, is an ongoing priority for the business.  

This extends well beyond the formal consultation process undertaken  

to determine the business’ material issues. The following table 

highlights our key stakeholders and how we engage with them on  

an ongoing basis to drive our long-term sustainability.

OUR PEOPLE

Our committed and talented people underpin our business.  

The evolution of the company over the past decade has enabled 

our people to grow their career with us. As we celebrate our  

10-year anniversary, we acknowledge and thank the many people 

in the organisation who have been with us for much of this time 

and who have played an integral role in shaping Civmec into the 

successful company it is today.

Our focus on developing and enhancing 

employee skills and capability is fostering the 

organic growth of talent across the business. 

Continuing to build expertise in our key areas 

of operation and diversifying into new markets 

provides ongoing opportunities to attract and 

retain the best available talent, with the retention 

of this talent a fundamental priority.

During FY2019 we implemented a number of initiatives 

to deliver best-practice in the way we support and 

manage our people, delivering on key items identified 

in the ‘Future Focus’ section of our 2018 Sustainability 

Report. These included:

•  The launch of Civtrac People, an addition to 

Civtrac, our proprietary, web-based integrated 

business management system. This new employee 

management platform, initially incorporating three 

modules – Recruitment, Onboarding and Employee 

Central – is facilitating our ability to source and 

transition quality personnel throughout and into the 

business. 

•  The introduction of online corporate and project 

specific induction programs, with a face-to-face site 

orientation component.

•  The implementation of our new Supervisor LEAD 

Program training course, incorporating four nationally 

accredited units, supporting leadership training, 

the identification of high potential individuals, and 

succession planning.

•  Completion of a remuneration review to ensure equity 

and alignment across the business.

•  Review of our employee benefits program, offering 

additional incentives for our people.

•  Appointment of a fulltime Learning &amp; Development 

Manager.

Data included in this section has been captured 

through the COINS payroll and HR system.

EMPLOYMENT

Civmec continues to hold its position as a significant employer in our industry,  

with 2,700 direct employees engaged during FY2019, and approximately a further 

700 employed as a result of our activities. 

We take great pride in our self-performance capability, enabling us to provide our 

clients with quality products and services that support their activities, and offering 

our people sustainable opportunities to grow their career with us. Multi-skilling our 

workforce provides a significant competitive advantage, with employees adaptable 

and able to be mobile across jobs, sites and locations.

New Employee Hires and Employee Turnover

The attraction and retention of skilled employees is a critical focus, and also a 

potential risk, for our business, particularly given the cyclical nature of the industry 

in which we operate. The tables below illustrate new employee hires and employee 

turnover during FY2019, by age group and gender. The statistical pattern illustrated 

is typical of our industry, where cyclical/short-term project contracts are awarded, 

and therefore these numbers represent the on-hire/off-hire process. The statistics 

also highlight the challenge of attracting females into operational roles, given the 

nature of the work we do across traditionally male-dominated trades and disciplines.

TRAINING AND EDUCATION 

As a progressive, technology-driven company, we recognise the importance of 

continually investing in the training and development of our people, providing 

progressive career pathways as a fundamental component of our retention strategy. 

Our core value of Collaboration means we work in partnership with our people to 

identify their individual training and development needs. 

Registered Training Organisation

We have invested significantly in facilities and training programmes and are a 

recognised Registered Training Organisation (RTO code 52645). Our RTO is 

registered nationally with the Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA) and delivers 

skills and competency-based training in every state across Australia, overseen by 

our full-time Learning and Development Manager. During FY2019, almost 3,000 

enrolments were processed for nationally accredited training courses and Verification 

of Competency units delivered by our RTO. The role of the RTO is to create a skilled 

and diverse workforce that drives our high-performance culture and supports the 

growth and retention of our people. 

The RTO has scope to deliver three nationally accredited qualifications in 

Work Health and Safety and Leadership and Management, offers 142 units of 

competence, and provides training across 10 skill sets. It specialises in high risk 

activities including crane operations, rigging, scaffolding, forklift and elevated work 

platform operations. It has expertise in mobile plant operations such as excavator, 

backhoe and roller operations, and offers specialised training for tilt up panel  

works. It has also developed a program of management training for supervisors 

that covers leadership, team management, project management and health and 

safety. In particular, focus across the business over the year has been on providing 

leadership training, including the identification of  

high potential individuals and succession planning.  

To support this, we implemented our new Supervisor 

LEAD Program training course, incorporating four 

nationally accredited units – Apply Risk Management 

Processes; Communicate Information; Supervise 

On-site Operations; and Show Leadership – 

delivered through our RTO.

CIVMEC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

Health and safety is a significant aspect of every course 

that the RTO provides, which increases the overall 

knowledge and safety of Civmec employees as they 

participate in training. Through the RTO, employees are 

trained to see and manage risks in a more proactive 

way within their workplace.

Apprentices and Trainees

Our commitment to supporting the future of our 

industry is reflected in the engagement of more than 

60 apprentices and trainees across our operations. 

Our apprentices include fabrication (boilermakers 

and welders), carpenters, and electrical, and our 

trainees are providing functional support in business 

administration, human resources and logistics.

Our apprenticeship program incorporates advanced 

technical capability, modern facilities, and individualised 

training and development opportunities. We provide 

apprentices with unparalleled opportunities to work 

across a diverse range of specialist capabilities and 

sectors, including heavy engineering, fabrication and 

construction, in the resources, infrastructure and 

defence markets.

Apprenticeship trades offered include:

•  Boilermaker – Certificate III in Engineering – 

Fabrication Trade (Heavy/Welding)

•  Carpenter – Certificate III in Carpentry and Joinery

•  Electrician – Certificate III in Electrotechnology 

Electrician or Certificate III in Engineering – Electrical/ 

Electronic Trade

•  Welder – Certificate III in Engineering – Fabrication 

Trade First Class Welder

We also offer a comprehensive traineeship program 

that provides trainees with insight across all operational 

aspects of our business. Trainees are guided and 

mentored by our highly experienced team of technical 

and management specialists, making Civmec 

traineeships an excellent way to start a career. 

Traineeship qualifications offered include: 

• Human Resources

• Business Administration

• Logistics/Warehousing

•  Non-certified construction skills such as concreting 

and steel-fixing 

Civmec apprenticeships and traineeships are 

recognised nationally and are highly regarded in the 

industry. We encourage applications from women and 

people with diverse backgrounds, including Aboriginal 

and Torres Strait Islanders.

During FY2019, we partnered with Luerssen Australia 

and ASC to launch the Shipbuilding Education and 

Apprenticeship (SEA) program, which will help build  

the skills needed for Australia’s multi-billion dollar  

naval shipbuilding industry. Under the program,  

12 scholarships have been awarded to engineering 

and trade students in Western Australia, South 

Australia and the Northern Territory. In addition, three 

of the scholarship recipients have also been awarded 

internship placements, including one with Civmec. 

Joshua’s Story 

“When Civmec took me on for 

my apprenticeship I started off 

with very little experience and 

skills in welding. Over the last two 

years I have developed my skills 

in welding, and I hope that after I 

finish I can continue to grow and 

learn as a qualified welder.

I see myself working here for 

many years to come. I hope 

one day to become a supervisor 

or leading hand in my trade at 

Civmec.”

Joshua Corley 

Apprentice Welder

I hope one day to 

become a supervisor or 

leading hand in my trade 

at Civmec.

CIVMEC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

Apprentices and Trainees (continued)

We partner with local high schools to provide outreach 

programs to mentor high school students to take 

science and engineering pathways. As such, we 

are an industry partner in the P-TECH and Subs in 

School programs and are also collaborating with 

South Metropolitan TAFE and local high schools, to 

introduce a school-based traineeship program during 

2019. Initially, this provides the opportunity for five local 

students completing Year 10, 11 or 12, who have an 

interest in the Metal Fabrication trades, to undertake 

work experience at our Henderson facility, whilst 

continuing their school education. On completion of 

their studies and traineeship, they will be considered 

for an opportunity to join our apprenticeship program. 

This commitment between the schools and Civmec, 

provides a mutual benefit to develop the next 

generation of trade professionals to meet expanding 

workforce requirements, including for the delivery of the 

Royal Australian Navy’s Offshore Patrol Vessel program 

over the next decade.



Victoria’s Story 

“I was working at Bunnings, straight out of high school,  

and looking for my next big step. I gave university a go,  

but it wasn’t for me. Then a family member suggested  

I apply for an advertised Business Administration Traineeship 

with Civmec.

I knew this could be the opportunity I was looking for; a paid 

traineeship at a well-known company, with the opportunity to 

complete a Certificate III and potentially  

earn myself a full-time position at the end of it. 

I applied straight away and after a few days I was booked 

in for an interview and was successful in securing the 

opportunity. The traineeship was set to run for 12 months, 

but it was my goal to finish it earlier which I hoped would give 

me a good chance of landing a role within the business. 

I worked across many different areas of the business, 

providing me with the opportunity to see how the 

business and its divisions work together, including Project 

Administration, Marketing, Payroll, Refractory/Shutdowns 

and Accounts. I had my own responsibilities and tasks and  

I felt I was contributing and making a difference. 

I finished my traineeship in half the time and was immediately 

offered a full-time position in our Receivals yard.

The traineeship was hugely beneficial. Not only did I complete 

my Certificate III, I also gained six months experience at one 

of Western Australia’s fastest growing businesses. I found 

a purposeful job with an opportunity to improve my skill-set 

while getting a taste of how multiple departments collaborate 

within the business. This is an experience I could never have 

gained in a classroom. 

I’ve now been at Civmec for an entire year. I have developed 

many skills and picked up a few new ones along the journey 

of my traineeship. It’s amazing to think that just over a year 

ago, I was confused about what I wanted with my career, 

whereas now I’m eager to keep trying new things, continue 

making a difference in my team, keep broadening my 

horizons and grow as an individual. It’s been incredible so far, 

and I’m excited for the years to come.”

Performance and Career Development

In addition to encouraging regular, informal, performance discussions 

between employees and their managers, a formal Performance and 

Career Appraisal process in undertaken annually at the beginning of each 

year. This process requires employees to review their previous year’s 

performance, meet with their manager to discuss this assessment, and set 

goals and targets for the coming 12 months. Learning, development and 

career opportunities are identified through this process and monitored and 

progressed throughout the year. 

As we celebrate our 10-year anniversary, we are fortunate to have a 

significant number of employees who have been with the business for 

many years, including some since its inception. This is testament to 

Civmec’s ability to provide people with viable career pathways to nurture  

a sustainable career, developing and growing with the company. 



Kristie-Lee’s Story 

“I started my career with Civmec as a Technical Clerk back in 2013, and a year 

later became a Project Administrator. Over the years, I have had the opportunity 

to work across a lot of different roles and departments, including Project 

Administration, Project Controls, Cost-Control, Contracts Administration, Payroll, 

Recruitment and Commercial.

My biggest challenge yet has been taking care of the Research &amp; Development 

for all departments/projects Australia-wide.

Over the past five years Civmec has provided me with the opportunity to really 

develop my career, while at the same time, understanding that I am raising a 

young family and enabling me to achieve a good work-life balance. As a woman 

in a male dominated industry, I have always felt very respected and valued here.”

Tyler’s Story 

“In 2012 I was selected for a Boilermaker 

apprenticeship with Civmec. Throughout my 

apprenticeship, I gained a variety of skills and 

knowledge, from structural steel fabrication and 

assembly works, to subsea piping and stainless 

fabrication, whilst working on a wide range of 

different projects.

Not long after I completed my apprenticeship 

in 2015, I was approached by Civmec with an 

opportunity to further my career as a Junior 

Estimator. Over the past few years, I have been 

supported and mentored by the Estimating 

team, developing key skills in estimating, client 

negotiations and business development.”

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

Diversity

Our commitment to driving diversity in the workplace is founded on a belief that a 

more balanced workforce, across age, gender and ethnicity, positively contributes  

to our culture and makes Civmec a more attractive place to work for all employees.

As we continue to strive for a supportive and inclusive workplace for all people, we 

are focused on actively capitalising on the diversity of skills, talents and perspectives 

of our people to harness an organisation where everyone works better together 

and feels valued and able to contribute. Across our entire operations, 6% of all 

employees are female.

As is typical of organisations in our industry, the ability to achieve a diverse 

workforce in the corporate environment is much easier than achieving this balance 

in operations and project delivery, particularly given our vast self-performance 

capability. It is extremely challenging to attract females into these roles, given the 

nature of the work we do across traditionally male-dominated trades and disciplines.

From a head office perspective, we have a much higher female participation rate,  

at 40%. Therefore, our continued focus remains at the grass-roots level, 

encouraging female apprentices to grow their career with Civmec, with three female 

apprentices working with us and one of our five school-based trainees being 

female. Going forward, we will continue to identify and support suitable candidates 

to join us in trade and operations roles onsite and in our manufacturing facilities. 

Furthermore, Kayla Roemer-Hanisch, who undertook work experience with us 

in 2018 as part of the P-TECH program, is our internship placement under the 

Shipbuilding Education and Apprenticeship program, and we look forward to 

providing Kayla with further hands-on experience to enable her to forge a career  

in the Australian shipbuilding industry.

There is an opportunity to improve the composition of our Board, with the future 

appointment of a female member. Notwithstanding this, there is regular participation 

at Board meetings of other senior managers from across the business, including a 

number of women. At the Key Management Personnel/General Managers/Group 

Managers level, women hold 20% of positions.

The company is committed to ensuring women and men receive equal pay for  

equal work and this is reinforced within our remuneration principles. We will 

continue to undertake an annual remuneration review. If there are any apparent 

gaps, they will be analysed to ensure that such gaps can be explained with 

reference to market forces which may include, for example, different rates of pay 

in different industries; location and the relative supply and demand for different 

qualifications; individual performance; experience; and capacity of hours able to 

work. The company lodges its compliance reports with the Workplace Gender 

Equality Agency (WGEA) annually. A copy of these reports may be obtained via 

the WGEA website.

Aboriginal Engagement 

Our Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP), developed in partnership 

with Reconciliation Australia, supports our commitment to building 

positive, sustainable relationships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait 

Islander (ATSI) people and their communities. The RAP identifies 

practical actions based on the three pillars of Relationships, Respect 

and Opportunities. Its intent is to provide employment, training and 

commercial partnership opportunities for ATSI people, businesses 

and community organisations and to develop a better understanding 

of cross-cultural sensitivities to improve relationships across the 

organisation.

We are also a member of Supply Nation, further developing our 

supplier diversity footprint and incorporating ATSI businesses into our 

supply chain. Supply Nation connects Australian buyers with verified 

Indigenous businesses to build a prosperous, vibrant and sustainable 

Indigenous enterprise sector.

During FY2019, we provided employment and training opportunities 

for some 75 people of ATSI heritage across our business. Overall, 

13% of our apprentices, including two females, are of ATSI descent. 

Continuing to grow our understanding and awareness and build 

relationships, we participated in National Reconciliation Week  

and NAIDOC Week during the year. Our Gruyere Gold project in  

the Eastern Goldfields supported Cosmo Newberry, a small  

Aboriginal community located between Laverton and Warburton  

in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia, with the 

donation of funds towards the construction of basketball courts  

for the local people.

NON-DISCRIMINATION 

We monitor the number of filed, addressed and 

resolved grievances regarding labour practices. 

Civmec’s confidential whistleblowing line is available 

to all employees and external stakeholders for raising 

concerns.

CIVMEC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

During the year, nil incidents of 

discrimination were reported through 

the confidential whistleblowing line.

OUR FUTURE FOCUS

We will continue to drive best-practice in the way we manage our 

people going forward, with future focus on: 

•  Continued commitment to leadership training, including 

identification of high potential individuals and succession planning.

•  Implementation of a succession planning strategy focused on  

three key areas:

-  Executive Management

-  Key Operational Roles 

-  Diversity Targets

•  Focus on strengthening our position as an ‘employer of choice’ and 

adopting industry practices aligned with that of our competitors.

•  Development of a formalised graduate program.

•  Expanding the reward and recognition strategy to target the 

direct workforce, implementing recognition mechanisms through 

management and peer-to-peer.

•  Review of payroll software platforms to drive continuous 

improvement and efficiency capitalisation.

Initiatives specifically focused on increasing female participation, 

include: 

•  Focused recruitment campaigns.

•  Review occupations (including non-traditional female roles)  

which can provide a more flexible roster, including part-time and  

job sharing.

•  Strengthen partnership programs with key stakeholders including 

clients, community groups and job networks, providing the 

foundation skills required for employment in the resource industry  

or pathways to higher level qualifications.

•  Increase opportunities through our RTO, with personalised training 

programs that provide flexibility and ease of access which remove 

the barriers that discourage women from gaining the skills and 

knowledge required to enter our industry sectors.

OUR COMMUNITY

CONTRIBUTING TO  

LOCAL COMMUNITIES 

Our value of Make a Difference empowers our 

people to positively impact the communities in 

which we live and work. In addition to providing 

local employment opportunities, we are also 

committed to making a difference through 

our various partnerships, sponsorships and 

donations. 

Our support during FY2019 saw us work with 

numerous charities and community groups, including:

St Vincent de Paul Society’s Drive-In, Sleep-In

A number of our people and their families participated 

in the 2018 Drive-In, Sleep-In, helping raise awareness 

and funds to support people who are experiencing 

or are at risk of homelessness. Braving the cold, wet 

conditions and sleeping in their cars for the night, an 

impressive $12,495 was raised for the St Vincent de 

Paul Society.

Cancer Council

Raising funds to support the Cancer Council’s mission 

to work with the community to reduce the incidence 

and impact of cancer, we hosted events during the 

year including Pink Ribbon Day and Australia’s Biggest

SOCIO ECONOMIC COMPLIANCE

We operate in a number of different geographical 

regions and in differing market sectors. This involves 

dealing with customers, competitors, suppliers, 

and various other stakeholders. It is integral to our 

business operations that we capture and report on 

our significant positive influences at the macro socio-

economic level in the regions in which we operate 

through to the direct impacts of our business activities 

in the communities which surround our operations. 

Socio-economic compliance is a precondition for 

successful operations. Known legal requirements 

shall always be met. Legislative compliance is critical, 

ensuring our business’ legitimacy. 

We continuously review and analyse the ways in 

which we respond to issues of concern raised 

through engagement with our stakeholders and 

which influence their assessment of the company. 

These include initiatives, both within and outside 

the company, including the continuous review of 

our Code of Conduct, policies and procedures in 

relation to human rights issues, ethical supply chain 

relations, our contribution to local economies and 

capacity development at community level. 

We impact a wide range of stakeholders in the 

regions in which we operate, both within local 

communities and broader national economies.  

We try at all times to understand and respond to  

our stakeholders’ interests. Doing so helps us 

be a good neighbour, an effective partner and 

a sustainable operator. Our engagement with 

communities, employees, stakeholders and 

clients seeks to understand the social, cultural, 

environmental and economic implications of our 

activities so that we can respond to concerns, reduce 

negative impacts and optimise benefits for local 

communities and the broader economy.

We are committed to conducting our operations with 

integrity and in a manner that is consistent with laws 

and business practices that are aimed at fostering an 

open, competitive and fair market environment and 

which will best serve the long-term interests of our 

customers, our stakeholders and the wider community.

CIVMEC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

HEALTH AND SAFETY

Our health and safety performance is critical to our business success and 

sustainability. Our strong safety culture is built on the Never Assume program, 

incorporating our core values and providing a framework for the behavioural 

expectations of our people across the business. 

We encourage our people to lead by example, looking out 

for themselves and those around them. Our commitment 

to continual improvement means we are always seeking 

opportunities to innovate and learn from our experience.  

We will continue to drive our safety culture, systems, planning 

and risk management to deliver improved health and safety 

outcomes for our people, clients and delivery partners.

During FY2019, a number of safety initiatives were implemented to 

support continuous improvement in our safety performance, delivering 

on key items identified in the ‘Future Focus’ section of our 2018 

Sustainability Report. 

In November, we held our Safety &amp; Leadership Forum, bringing 

people together from across the business to talk about safety, 

leadership and opportunities for improvement. A comprehensive 

list of ideas and improvement initiatives resulted from the forum, 

which were actioned over the ensuing months, including:

•  Implementation of our new Supervisor LEAD Program training 

course, incorporating four nationally accredited units delivered 

through our internal RTO: 

- Apply Risk Management Processes;

- Communicate Information; 

- Supervise On-site Operations; and 

- Show Leadership. 

•  HSE systems improvement, with the introduction of six new 

operational level procedures.

•  Further enhancement of the Never Assume program, with the 

development of a behaviour-based safety program. 

•  Revised and updated corporate and project specific induction 

programs to online platforms, with a face-to-face site orientation 

component. 

Also in November, we launched our Critical Safety Essentials, outlining 

the business’ mandatory expectations for safe behaviour and delivery. 

The way we manage safety starts with these Critical Safety Essentials 

and every employee is expected to abide by these underlying rules, 

which form the foundation of how we operate.

CIVMEC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

During the year, we finalised plans to integrate a mobile/tablet based 

program into our existing safety software program. This will enable 

field verification inspections, behavioural observations and hazard 

reporting to be done on an electronic device, reducing administration 

time and increasing efficiency. This program will be formally rolled out 

during the next period. 

Going forward, we will continue to evolve our safety culture, systems, 

planning and risk management to deliver improved health and safety 

outcomes for our people, clients and delivery partners. 

SYSTEMATIC APPROACH

Our commitment to health and safety is built on robust processes 

and a strong culture. Our systems have recently been re-certified to 

OHSAS 18001 (the internationally recognised standard for health 

and safety management) for another three years. Our management 

system is based around the principles of risk management and the 

system provides a broad set of requirements to support our wide-

ranging scope of business activities. Civmec’s executive and senior 

management remain committed to continually enhancing safety 

performance throughout the company’s operations.

Our Never Assume program, incorporating our core values, provides 

a framework for the behavioural expectations of our people across 

the business, in order to build a strong and sustainable safety culture. 

The program is designed to empower every person in the company 

to ensure their work practices are focused on achieving a safe work 

environment, reinforcing the right and responsibility of every employee 

to stop work and intervene if they see an unsafe act, condition or 

behaviour and be part of the solution. Implementation of our health 

and safety systems is supported by our on-site fitness-for-work health 

centre and our status as a Registered Training Organisation (RTO), 

with extensive training undertaken specific to safety processes, 

procedures, awareness and improving proficiency.

CIVMEC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

SAFETY PERFORMANCE

As an evolving and diversified business, we strive for best-practice in our health 

and safety systems, sharing learnings and ideas across projects and throughout 

the organisation. Our company operates under a continuous improvement model 

and an increased focus on HSE and field leadership across the business has led 

to improvements in our risk management approach in a dynamic and constantly 

changing environment.

FY2019 was again a busy year for Civmec, having worked just over 4.6 million 

hours (including contractors) with the majority of hours accumulated in 

environments of work considered to be of higher risk. During the period we had  

a reduction in our all injury frequency rate (AIFR), which records injuries requiring  

at least a first aid treatment, to 42.66 per million hours worked, a reduction from 

44.57 in 2018. We also noted a reduction in our lost time injury frequency rate 

(LTIFR) to 0.22 per million hours worked.

Over the reporting period for all injuries, the most common injured body parts were 

hand/fingers which equated to 25% of all injuries, followed by arms/shoulders at 

17%, leg/hip at 16% and back injuries at 15%. 

There has been a concerted effort by the business during the reporting period  

to continue to drive strong field leadership and proactive leading indicators such  

as hazard reporting, workplace inspections and behavioural safety observations. 

This continues to be a major focus for the business and this approach will assist  

with a sustained reduction in injuries across the business over the longer term.

Our safety performance across key metrics is outlined in the tables below:

HEALTH AND WELLBEING

Health and wellbeing have a significant impact on an employee’s 

safety at work. We understand injury prevention is a critical part of 

improving overall wellbeing. Given the nature of the work we do,  

many employees engage in manual or repetitive tasks, and as such 

these people may be at risk of degenerative injuries over time.  

To mitigate this, during FY2019 we have developed a program for 

the pre-emptive management of musculoskeletal injuries, which will 

be implemented during FY2020. This program sets a target of 25% 

reduction in recorded incidences over the following two years.

The health and wellbeing of our employees is supported in various 

ways across the business, with key initiatives including:

•  an onsite medical facility, promoting active lifestyle programs on  

a range of contemporary public health topics;

•  an injury management service to assist employees with both  

work-related and non-work-related injuries and illnesses to  

enable their return to work;

•  prevention programs including health assessments and  

pre-employment screening;

•  an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) available to employees  

and their families, providing confidential counselling as well as 

access to dieticians and financial counselling specialists;

•  access to education programs specifically developed to support 

those with supervisory, or leadership responsibilities;

•  early intervention programs such as drug and alcohol testing,  

and a zero tolerance to the presence of these substances at work;

•  participation in health promotion events such as Movember and  

RUOK? Day;

•  provision of comfortable amenities to take a break, including an 

onsite café at our Henderson facility; and 

•  benefits such as discounts on gym membership, health insurance, 

financial advisory services and travel.

OUR FUTURE FOCUS

Building on the improvements achieved and initiatives implemented in 

FY2019, we will continue to adopt a strong, proactive approach going 

forward, driving our Safety Management System towards a best-

practice model. In order to achieve this, we will focus on the following 

key areas in FY2020:

•  Continue to develop and implement proactive programs, including 

the use of Job Demand Assessments (JDA) in the pre-employment 

process, and training and awareness programs for work-related 

activities and general health and wellbeing.

•  Implement the program for the pre-emptive management of 

musculoskeletal injuries.

•  Formal rollout of the mobile/tablet based inspection and reporting 

program.

•  Achieve industry benchmark external accreditation to ISO45001 to 

supersede existing OHSAS18001 accreditation.

•  Develop and implement a hand injury prevention program to drive  

a reduction in hand injuries across the business.

•  Embed our behaviour-based safety program (building on the Never 

Assume principles) into core business activities and company 

culture to shape the behaviours and actions of individuals and 

teams, continuing to work towards an interdependent culture.

We will continue to maintain a strong focus on safety, as a critical 

element of our ongoing business improvement model being applied 

throughout the business.

ENVIRONMENT

Strong environmental performance is essential to the ongoing success, growth and 

sustainability of our company. Promoting an environmentally aware culture through 

training and communication; demonstrating leadership and commitment to applying 

best-practice in environmental management across our operations; and continually 

improving our environmental performance and efficiency, is fundamental to our 

business strategy and operating method.

By delivering a strong environmental performance we in turn 

benefit our clients, the communities we operate in and the 

environment. Our environmental commitments are articulated 

in our Environmental Policy.

During FY2019 we continued to implement initiatives to drive 

environmental best-practice at our fabrication and assembly facilities 

in Perth and Newcastle and across our project sites, in support of 

the key items identified in the ‘Future Focus’ section of our 2018 

Sustainability Report. These included:

•  Promoting an environmentally aware culture through ongoing 

training and communication across all levels of the business.

•  Ongoing systems review and improvement. 

•  Improving efficiency through innovation – energy intensity and 

emissions intensity were reduced by (4)% and (5)% respectively  

in FY2019 compared to the previous year.

•  Further developing and implementing our waste management 

strategy – co-mingled recycling was up by 47% in FY2019 

compared to the previous year.

CIVMEC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Operating within our industry, we are required to 

adhere to a wide variety of local, state and federal 

rules and regulations along with relevant Australian and 

international standards which have been developed 

over time to protect and respect the environment and 

the communities we operate and live in. 

We have in place a robust Health Safety and 

Environmental Management System (HSEMS) that is 

certified by Lloyds Register in accordance with ISO 

14001:2015 Environmental Management System. 

Our management system provides a sound platform 

to drive conformity in the way we identify, understand 

and manage environmental issues across the various 

jurisdictions and operational environments we work in.

To maintain legal compliance, all of our facilities and 

projects sites are required to identify, document 

and monitor all legal and other requirements that 

are relevant to the works being conducted. Project 

and facility legal compliance, along with our internal 

standards and expectations, is further measured as 

part of our scheduled corporate auditing program.

ENERGY, EMISSIONS AND OUR 

CHANGING CLIMATE 

Heavy engineering and construction requires high 

energy inputs and therefore it is imperative we have 

access to a reliable, affordable and efficient energy 

supply. 

We acknowledge the scientific consensus on climate 

change and accept we must play our part in reducing 

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in line with the 

Paris Agreement, as signed by Australia and its fellow 

signatories. 

Climate uncertainty presents many known, and many 

still unknown, challenges to the global environment, 

its communities and our business, which need to be 

identified and understood. We will continue to include 

these factors in our risk profile, ensuring any material 

impacts and opportunities are continually assessed 

and mitigated accordingly. It should be noted, that 

within our industry a changing climate may also present 

opportunities, such as the likely investment required to 

improve and build climate change related infrastructure 

around the world. 

Our Energy

At present 100% of our electricity consumption at our 

manufacturing/production facilities is sourced from 

local electricity networks in Western Australia and 

New South Wales. Energy consumed at our projects 

is difficult to accurately measure due to the various 

project arrangements in often remote locations, and 

therefore it is not included in this report.



During FY2019, we received no 

environmental fines/breaches and/ 

or notices in relation to state or 

federal laws and regulations.

CIVMEC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

Our Energy (continued)

Most of the energy usage at our facilities is attributed to electricity 

consumed through the fabrication process, comprising handling, 

cutting, bending, welding, drilling, assembling and coating our 

products. In addition to this, electricity is consumed to heat, cool, 

light and provide general power to our corporate and manufacturing 

facilities. We also consume fuels and gases to power machinery and 

equipment, with some gases consumed through the welding and 

cutting processes. 

To allow us to measure and compare the energy intensity of our 

fabrication facilities over time, we measure our total energy input 

in Terajoules (TJ) per million dollars of turnover ($m AUD). During 

FY2019, Civmec facilities consumed a total of 33.70 TJ, which is 

a decrease of (29)% when compared to FY2018 levels. Our focus 

on efficiency through innovation is a driving factor behind this 

improvement. With reduced manual and material handling, materials 

tracking and traceability, advanced automation, increased in-house 

modularisation and commissioning and with an ongoing focus on 

training our local workforce, we believe we will continue to improve 

our efficiency over time. 

Our Emissions

During FY2019, our facilities achieved a decrease in Scope 1 and 

Scope 2 emissions of (26)% and (28)% respectively. 

To allow us to measure and compare the emissions intensity of our 

facilities over time, we measure the CO2 emitted in tonnes (tCO2e) 

per million dollars of turnover ($m AUD). In FY2019, our emissions 

intensity decreased by (5)% when compared to FY2018 levels.

We have continued to invest in and develop both our Henderson 

and Newcastle facilities. Once the development of these facilities is 

complete and they are fully operational, we will collect energy data 

for at least 12 months to understand what our energy profile looks 

like. This data will then guide us in determining the most suitable 

renewable energy system to invest in to meet our future requirements. 

Our ongoing strategy with respect to reducing our overall GHG 

emissions and emissions intensity shall be delivered through our 

investment in and implementation of our efficiency programs. 

The table below illustrates our facilities’ energy and emissions data 

(Henderson and Newcastle), including:

•  energy data which includes diesel, petrol, electricity, LPG and 

welding gas;

•  Scope 1 emissions comprising diesel, petrol, LPG and acetylene; 

•  Scope 2 emissions comprising our purchased electricity; and 

•  emissions intensity measuring Scope 1 and Scope 2 against 

turnover.

CASE STUDY

Conversion to LED Lighting

We are continually striving to improve our environmental performance, with 

a focus on driving efficiency in the resources and energy we consume.

During FY2019, we investigated the feasibility and potential positive 

environmental outcomes to be gained through converting to an LED 

lighting system throughout our 29,300m2 heavy engineering workshop and 

its adjoining office.

LED lights use less power compared to traditional halogen and fluorescent 

lights, by only producing light rather than creating light and heat, and as 

such, the overall kWh consumption per year is reduced, thereby reducing 

CO2 emissions. In addition, LED lights contain no mercury or lead, which 

is beneficial to the environment, and waste is reduced because LEDs last 

longer.

Through our analysis, we determined that changing a total of 624 lights 

would deliver the following environmental and cost benefits:

•  An estimated 284,784 kWh (or a reduction of 52% consumption) per 

year in the workshop and an estimated 46,368 kWh (or a reduction of 

44% consumption) per year in the workshop office.

•  This decrease in power usage will deliver a decrease in carbon 

emissions, with an estimated reduction of 205.04 t-CO2-e per year in the 

workshop and 33.38 t-CO2-e per year in the workshop office.

•  This equates to an estimated electricity cost saving of $65,500 per year 

for the workshop and $10,664 per year for the workshop office.

On the basis of these substantial benefits, all lights in the workshop and 

workshop office are being converted to LED.

EFFLUENTS AND WASTE

Global waste pollution is a significant environmental issue. Producing 

waste is an outcome of the industry in which we operate, and 

therefore we accept we have a role to play in reducing our impact. 

Our waste management strategy consists of the following:

•  to continually raise awareness across the business and improve 

the culture of how we view waste management and recycling; 

•  to reduce our own waste and waste within the supply chain with 

a focus on packaging; and 

•  to capture all recyclable materials and reduce waste going to landfill. 

The waste data included in the table below relates to our two 

manufacturing facilities in Henderson and Newcastle. Obtaining 

accurate waste management data for projects is difficult, due to  

some projects having their waste managed by the client or owner. 

Civmec facilities do not discharge any waste materials to the 

environment. All waste materials are contained and removed from  

site for further processing. 

All waste data included in this report has been provided by the 

relevant waste service providers.

Trade Waste License

We utilise a trade waste license to discharge quantities of treated 

wash water into the sewerage network from the Henderson 

maintenance and logistics workshop. Wastewater is created from  

the washing down of equipment using a high-pressure washer that 

may contain oils and grease. This water is passed through an oily 

water separator and then discharged into the network for further 

treatment. 

Spills

Due to the nature of our work and the type of equipment we operate, 

occasionally minor hydrocarbon and chemical spills do occur. 

Hydrocarbon and chemical spills affect the environment in different 

ways depending on the type and volume of material spilt and the 

receiving environment. If a spill clean-up is managed effectively, the 

exposure to personnel and environmental damage is minimised. 

To minimise the risk of impacting the surrounding environment we 

shall continue to implement our operational controls. We believe 

the best form of spill management is spill prevention and it is the 

responsibility of all personnel to ensure they are aware of and comply 

with all company and regulatory requirements. To support this, we 

undertake regular spill training sessions with our people.

OUR FUTURE FOCUS

To drive ongoing improvement in our performance, we shall continue to implement our environmental 

programs across the business, focusing on the following key areas:

•  Continue to promote an environmentally aware culture through ongoing training and communication to  

all levels of the business.

•  Continually improve our Environmental Management systems and achieve ongoing compliance with our 

legal and other commitments across all Civmec facilities and projects sites, to be verified through our 

scheduled corporate auditing program.

•  Continue to focus on improving efficiency through innovation, measured via efficiency indicators such as 

energy intensity (TJ/$m AUD) and emissions intensity (tCO2-e/$m AUD).

•  Further develop and implement our waste management strategy, with the aim of increasing year on year 

the proportion of co-mingled and wood recyclable waste streams compared to the general waste stream. 

We believe that by delivering on these key focus areas, we will achieve our long-term sustainability goals, 

delivering valuable outcomes for the environment and our stakeholders.

GOVERNANCE

Civmec’s Board and management are committed to maintaining a high standard 

of governance and ethics. They recognise the importance of good governance 

in ensuring transparency and protecting the interests of shareholders, as well 

as strengthening investors’ confidence in the management of all aspects of the 

company’s operations.

The Board and Executive promote high standards of corporate 

behaviour and, as a dual listed company, endorse both the 

SGX Principles of the Code of Corporate Governance and the 

ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations. 

Civmec’s Report on Corporate Governance for the year ending 

30 June 2019 (in which we report against these principles) is 

included in our 2019 Annual Report, available on our website. 

To assist in the execution of its responsibilities, the Board has 

established several Board Committees, including an Audit Committee, 

Nominating Committee, Remuneration Committee and Risks and 

Conflicts Committee. These Committees function within clearly 

defined terms of reference and operating procedures, which are 

reviewed on a regular basis. 

Our Code of Conduct sets the standard of behaviour which guides 

how we act when performing our work, how we make decisions and 

against which we can measure our performance and hold ourselves 

accountable. The Code comprises principles that apply in various 

aspects of our working environment, including how we interact with 

colleagues and how we engage third parties to perform work for us or 

to represent us.

ANTI-CORRUPTION

Assessment Processes

All of the company’s legal entities have been assessed by their 

management teams regarding the implementation of anti-corruption 

practices and incidents of corruption. 

All new major suppliers are required to comply with the Supplier 

Code of Conduct, committing to respect our zero-tolerance policy 

concerning bribery and corruption. Suppliers must have systems 

in place to ensure the proper instruction, training, and auditing of 

personnel and subcontractors to ensure compliance. We perform 

supplier audits and evaluations to monitor and assess compliance 

with the company’s requirements and the Code of Conduct. Suppliers 

are obliged to immediately inform us of any known violations of the 

Code of Conduct.

Corruption risks are investigated as part of the ongoing internal 

auditing of the company. If corruption is suspected, the HR 

Business Unit together with Executive Management and possibly 

other business units, will carry out an investigation, with the help 

of specialised third parties, if necessary. The Risks and Conflicts 

Committee assesses the findings of the investigation and orders 

disciplinary or other measures against culpable employees, 

which may also lead to the termination of employment and/or the 

termination of contracts with business partners, or to such contracts 

not being extended or changed for precautionary reasons. To prevent 

corruption risks, we undertake business reviews of high-risk business 

in high-risk environments with high-risk customers. 

Communication &amp; Training

Our approach to anti-corruption is based on the Code of Conduct, 

which clearly prohibits bribery and corruption. Compliance with the 

Code of Conduct, as an integral part of the employment contract and 

the onboarding program, is the personal responsibility of each Civmec 

employee. In addition, employees receive training at least once a 

year. Corporate Legal, Internal Audit and Corporate Compliance 

teams regularly conduct training sessions and audits. Executive 

General Managers and Business Unit Managers are responsible for 

the compliance of their departments with applicable laws, internal 

regulations, including the Code of Conduct, and for the information 

and training of their staff. 

In FY2019 we conducted formal training in proactive avoidance 

of possible violations against the Code of Conduct, both with 

e-learnings and with classroom-based (face-to-face) courses. 

Training is group-specific, based on cases, and modern training 

tools are used (multi-media). Participation is mandatory for all 

employees in relevant roles. 

Recorded Incidents

Adoption of and compliance with the Code of Conduct by the 

General Managers and their management teams was reviewed 

in 2019. Our employees are the most effective channel to detect 

violation, underlining transparency as a key value at Civmec which 

must be supported and preserved.

CLICK TO VIEW 

Anti-Bribery and 

Corruption Policy

In FY19 there were no formal allegations made 

against Civmec in relation to bribery, corruption 

or kickbacks. There were also no legal 

proceedings against Civmec or its employees 

for alleged corruption during FY2019.

ANTI-COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOUR

Purpose

We operate in a number of different geographical regions and in 

differing market sectors. This involves dealing with customers, 

competitors, suppliers, and various other stakeholders. It is critical for 

our ongoing sustainability that the company conducts its operations 

in compliance with laws and business practices including but not 

limited to those related to anti-competitive behaviours. 

We are committed to conducting our operations with integrity and in 

a manner that is consistent with laws and business practices that are 

aimed at fostering an open, competitive and fair market environment 

and which will best serve the long-term interests of our customers, 

our stakeholders and the wider community. 

We are committed to dealing fairly and honestly with our customers, 

suppliers, competitors and any other business partners and the 

community (collectively ‘stakeholders’), and observing relevant 

legislation, regulation, contractual obligations and our corporate 

policies – in particular the provisions of the Competition and 

Consumer Act (‘CCA’), and the Australian Consumer Law (‘ACL’).

Guidelines 

The key guidelines which govern our approach to anti-competitive 

behaviour are as follows:

1.  The CCA governs anti-competitive and unfair behaviours. It is 

regulated by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission 

(‘ACCC’).

2.  Our corporate policies prohibit entry by any person representing 

Civmec into any arrangements which are illegal under the CCA, 

have the purpose or (in some cases) the effect of substantially 

lessening competition, or breach the ACL.

3.  We predominantly operate under the provisions of the CCA and 

ensure compliance with this Act (amongst others). This includes the 

prohibition of behaviours such as: 

a)  agreements between competitors to fix, maintain or control 

prices;

b)  agreements between competitors to split up a market or 

customers; 

c)  agreements between competitors not to deal with particular 

suppliers, customers or other competitors;

d)  conduct that is prohibited if it has the purpose or effect of 

substantially lessening competition as defined under the CCA, 

which may include, depending on circumstances, exclusive 

dealing and other restrictive arrangements;

e)  the supply of goods or services on condition that the customer 

purchases goods or services from a third party; and

f)  inducing resellers to not sell products below a specified price. 

4.  We also prohibit agreements, arrangements or understandings that 

have the purpose, effect or likely effect of substantially lessening 

competition in a market.

Civmec had zero legal actions pending  

or completed in FY2019 in relation to  

anti-competitive behaviour and violations  

of anti-trust and monopoly legislation.

Furthermore, to date, Civmec has never 

received or been the subject of any legal action 

in relation to anti-competitive behaviour and 

violations of anti-trust and monopoly legislation.

CIVMEC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

Policy Compliance

Failure to comply with the policy in relation to anti-competitive 

behaviour may result in substantial fines and penalties being imposed 

upon Civmec and may expose the company and/or its employees 

to civil or criminal liability or other financial or reputational damage. 

It may put our business licences at risk. Employees who breach the 

policy may face disciplinary action including dismissal. 

The Executive General Manager Commercial &amp; Risk is responsible 

for implementation of Civmec’s competition law compliance. This is 

critical to the business for a number of reasons:

•  failure to comply with competition rules can have an extremely high 

financial cost with regards to fines from the Australian Government;

•  any agreement that infringes competition law may be wholly or 

partially invalid which means that the company cannot enforce it;

•  third parties who suffer loss as a result of anti-competitive behaviour 

may be able to claim damages from Civmec for their loss;

•  investigations into the company and findings of infringements attract 

adverse media comment; and

•  investigations and possible legal proceedings resulting from 

infringements can take years to resolve, incurring high costs and 

taking up management time that should be devoted to more 

profitable projects. 

We encourage our staff to be vigilant and proactive in circumstances 

where they have concerns about conduct that may breach the CCA, 

and encourage employees to escalate any such concerns they 

might have to their line manager or the Executive General Manager, 

Commercial &amp; Risk.

PROCUREMENT PRACTICES –  

LOCAL INDUSTRY PARTICIPATION

Civmec provides full, fair and reasonable opportunity for local industry 

to take part in all its activities. This maximises participation where 

subcontractors and suppliers are capable and competitive on the 

basis of OHS, environment, quality, delivery and value-for-money 

standards. 

Our Local Industry Participation (LIP) Policy articulates our approach 

to driving opportunities for local participation, including:

•  developing project specific LIP plans;

•  providing early and fair opportunities to all local industries;

•  developing a communications strategy for local industry so that they 

are informed at the earliest opportunity of upcoming subcontractor/

supply opportunities;

•  ensuring local capabilities are considered when planning work 

scope to optimise opportunities for local businesses;

•  providing training and development opportunities for local providers 

in order to enhance their sustainability;

•  giving preference to tenderers that use the greatest local content in 

labour and materials; and

•  working with government, industry bodies and communities to 

improve local industry participation, capability and competitiveness.

In FY2019, 98% of Civmec’s procurement spend was in Australia, 

with only 2% spent internationally.
