BOARD STATEMENT 

 

Dear Stakeholders, 

Delong Holdings Limited has progressed into the second year of sustainability reporting. We 

believe that integrating sustainability in our business strategies will achieve sustainable 

growth for the Group as well as to upgrading the business model and strategies.  

This year, we have made good progress in managing the Environmental, Social and 

Governance (“ESG”) issues in our long-term sustainable business strategies, ensuring that 

our efforts to improve financial performance align with our sustainability efforts. Our 

employee new hire rate has shown a good progress with an increased to 10.6% as compared

improvement with 6.6% as compared to 10.0% in FY2017.  

Furthermore, we also maintained our safety track record of zero workplace fatalities and 

occupational disease cases and have seen an improvement to the lost day rate. We have 

achieved our target to record zero reportable (lost-time) incidents.  

We recognise the importance of maintaining a balance between economic, environmental, 

social and governance obligations. The continuous integration of sustainability measures in 

our strategy and operations will be complemented by quality disclosures so as to provide 

stakeholders with a holistic view of the Group’s performance and prospects. 

Looking ahead, we will continually improve our performance and proactively integrate 

sustainable practices into our business strategy.

December 2018 (FY 2018) is shown in the table below. 

 

Figure 4: Financial Performance FY2018 (RMB’M) 

For a more detailed breakdown of its 2018 financial results, please refer to the relevant 

sections in Delong Holdings Limited’s Annual Report 2018 (Annual Report). 

 

ENVIRONMENT 

OUR APPROACH 

Our business operations pose a significant impact on the environment. We are committed 

to effectively manage the environmental aspects as well as to comply with applicable 

environmental standards, laws, and regulations.  

 

ENERGY 

Our main operations are in manufacturing and production, as such energy consumption is a 

key issue of concern. The energy sources used in the company are coal, waste gas (biomass) 

and electricity. We have implemented an energy monitoring practice to handle energy usage 

within the company. With the monitoring initiative in place, we achieved the target of 

FY2017 to minimising the energy consumption within the company by 19.8%, which 

equivalent to 9,291,106,318 MWh or 2,580,862 MJ.  

At Delong, we have a designated team to monitor the energy usage within the company. 

The team will conduct regular inspections and analyse the energy consumption data on a 

monthly 

basis. 

Energy 

surges 

that 

were 

identified 

within 

the 

company 

will 

be investigated for possible faults in the instruments and machinery. 




7 

 

The below charts show the detailed breakdown of Delong’s energy consumption statistics.  

 

 

Figure 5: Energy Consumption (MWh) 

 

Figure 6: Total Energy Consumption (MWh) 






8 

 

In FY 2018, the total energy consumption was recorded at 10,428,509 megawatt (MWh) 

hour which equivalent to 37,542,632,476 megajoules (MJ).  

In the future, we aim to achieve greater efficiency in the use of energy to lower our operating 

costs within the company.  

 

WATER 

Water is identified as a priority resource for our business. We are committed to reducing water 

consumption and encouraging the use of treated/recycled water in our daily operations. We 

have a strategic approach to water management by:  

 

Implementing a water reuse system in our daily operations to reduce the reliance on 

municipal supply; and   

 

Establishing monitoring water leak detection work to monitor water usage as well as 

to reduce wastage due to leaking pipes or water overflow within the company. 

The below charts show the detailed breakdown of Delong’s water consumption statistics.  

 

Figure 7: Water Consumption (m3) 

In FY 2018, the total water consumption was recorded at 6,193,250 m3. However, we will 

continue our effort in reducing the water consumption within the company by monitoring 

water leak detection work which is also in line with the company’s objective in minimising 

the operating cost. 

 

 

 




9 

 

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE 

In order to ensure legal compliance, we analyse and follow the environmental laws and 

regulations in the countries which we operate in closely.  

 

In FY2018, there were no major incidences involving significant fines or non-monetary 

sanctions for non-compliance with environmental laws and/or regulations. We aim to maintain 

this level of performance through continual adherence.   

 

PEOPLE 

OUR APPROACH 

We emphasise the protection of labour rights, equal opportunity and non-discrimination in the 

workplace. We have a human resource policy that expresses the commitment to the ethical, 

professional and legal standards with the objectives to: 

 

Developing employees’ working competencies through learning and development; 

 

Creating a well-balanced workplace to attract talent; 

 

Fostering fair and equitable workplace culture; and 

 

Caring for employees’ well-being and benefits. 

 

EMPLOYMENT 

In FY2018, we have a total 4,530 employees. The graphs below show our employees broken 

down by gender and age categories.  

 

Figure 8: Employee Statistics by Gender and Age Group FY2018 






10 

 

Recruitment of new employees is conducted in line with our corporate human resource policy. 

The below charts show the detailed breakdown of our employment statistics.  

 

Figure 9: Employee New Hire and Turnover Rate FY2018 

This year, our employee new hire rate has also shown a good progress with an increase to 

10.6% as compared to 8.7% in FY2017. Furthermore, our employee turnover rate has 

decreased to 6.6% as compared to 10.0% in FY2017. 

In the coming years, we aim to provide equal opportunities when employing regardless of 

race, religion or gender. 

 

TRAINING AND EDUCATION 

We believe in employees’ learning and development by grooming them to their fullest 

potential, personally and professionally. At Delong, we emphasise heavily on continual 

training so as so to enhance staff performance and upgrade their professional skillsets.  

The training thus ensures that employees are able to acquire the necessary skillset relevant 

to their job scope. Regardless of category, each employee, on an average, has more than 100 

hours of training annually.  

The below charts show the detailed breakdown of employees’ average training hours by 

gender and employee categories. 

 






11 

 

In the future, we aim to maintain the 100 hours of training per employee per annum and 

continue to work toward equipping our employees with necessary knowledge and skills to 

improve their capabilities.  

 

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY  

We consider people as the backbone of our business operation and strive to ensure that our 

employees’ health and safety are always taken care of. We have formulated various systems 

for occupational health and safety (OHS) within the company.  

A Safety committee has been established at Delong to improve environmental health and 

safety (EHS) performance within the company, prevent industrial safety occupational 

diseases, as well as to create awareness of EHS among our employees.  

In the event of incidents, we have an on-site response plan that gives the safety committee 

overall responsibility in the treatment and evacuation of any injured workers. 

The diagram below shows a full breakdown of our company’s occupational health and safety 

statistics for this year.  

 

To continue the emphasis on managing workplace health and safety in our business, we have 

outlined goals and targets to better manage health and safety concerns of our employees. 

We aim to achieve an excellent OHS culture within our Group to achieve zero reportable (lost-

time) incidents. We continuously monitor and strive to improve the performance and safety 

standards of the workplace environment.
