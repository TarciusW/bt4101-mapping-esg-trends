As a market leader in a niche logistics sector, we 

demonstrate our commitment through the adoption of 

responsible business practices. The Group is committed 

to complying with all applicable laws and regulations in all 

the markets we operate in. The Board expects all Group 

employees to be vigilant to maintain the corporate values 

and high quality of the Group's products and services.

We believe that long term investment in human capital 

and ‘green’ equipment is key to the long-term sustainable 

success of Chasen Group. Therefore, we continue to 

implement our staff training and development roadmap, as 

well as enhancing the environmental sustainability of our 

operations in a low carbon economy in the future.

Sustainability is the crux of the success of any enterprise, 

especially enterprises with the conviction to achieve triple 

bottomline, namely ‘People, Profit, Planet’, for the benefits 

of both private enterprise and society. 

At Chasen Holdings Limited (“Chasen” or “The Company”), 

we are committed to uphold the highest standards of 

Economic, Social and Governance (ESG) practices within 

our organisation.  While we are taking our first steps in the 

sustainability journey, we have embraced our corporate 

social responsibility with conviction and enthusiasm.

We believe our sustainable growth and success is 

only possible with the sustainable development of the 

communities we operate in, be it social, business or 

national communities.

Driving long term sustainability is our vision. Centred on 

our key material issues, we have charted a four-pronged 

approach to our sustainable development roadmap. We 

will endeavour to set ourselves on the journey of achieving 

a good balance between commercial growth and ESG 

performance.

Shared 

Values


Economic Contribution to Society

At present, we are headquartered in Singapore, with 

operations extending to Asia and the United States of 

America.  We manage our operations in accordance to our 

sustainability principles.  We work closely with our operation 

staff to identify and consider any sustainability opportunities 

and risks that may arise.  

Sustainability trends such as climate change, resource 

scarcity and demographic changes shape the competitive 

environment in which companies like Chasen operate 

by introducing long term sustainability opportunities 

and recognising risks. We therefore view our business 

performance beyond short term gains and financial 

bottomline. Our conviction is to achieve a balanced triple 

bottomline, i.e. People, Profit, Planet for sustained growth 

for the organisation and the community it operates in.

The success of our business is highly dependent on 

the commitment of our management and staff.  Their 

knowledge, professional expertise and their job satisfaction 

are key to our economic sustainability.  

More importantly, we strive to contribute positively to 

society through our economic presence by serving as 

Singapore’s leading specialist relocation company in South 

East Asia, China and the United States of America, while 

maintaining good stewardship of the resources we manage 

and generating good shareholders’ value.

Our business model focuses on cost leadership without 

compromising our service level and highest priority on 

customer’s interest.  We seek organic growth from the 

existing business units as well as through the acquisition of 

new businesses that reap good returns.

We strive to maintain our market position by ensuring we 

gain the trust of our customers and their families, and 

continually build our reputation and brand name in specialist 

relocation, third party logistics and technical &amp; engineering 

services industry in Asia Pacific.

ECONOMIC

The Group’s vision is to offer integrated services combining 

technical and engineering capabilities to complement 

logistics services. As the vision is being realised the Group 

would enhance its competitiveness beyond pricing.

As a whole, Chasen continues to make good progress 

and the current financial year is expected to be another 

watershed as each subsidiary successfully implement 

their strategic business plans approved by the Board. As 

book orders continue to build up and projects executed 

across our business segments and geographic regions, we 

hope to exceed previous achievements in annual revenue 

and bottomline in tune with global economic growth 

opportunities.

If the revenue targets for this financial year are achieved, 

and barring unforeseen circumstances, the Group would be 

expected to be well on its way to achieve its target of $200 

million in revenue by 2020 through the following strategies:

I. Scaling up relocation business in China, Malaysia, Vietnam 

and the US;

II. Growing the 3PL cross-border land freight business; and

III. Streamlining Singapore operations, particularly the 

Technical &amp; Engineering operations, to improve internal cost 

efficiencies.

In today’s highly volatile business environment, Chasen has, 

beyond sustained earnings, diligently embraced prudent 

financial management, capitalised on our assets and 

investments, and remained focused on growth strategies, to 

enhance shareholders’ value.

performance, please refer to financial highlights in page 8-9
