Board Statement 

 

MindChamps Preschool Limited (“MindChamps”) is pleased to present our inaugural Sustainability 

Report (this “Report”) for the financial year ended 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”).  

 

At MindChamps, we strongly believe in the potential of education to drive positive social change. This 

belief gives us the impetus to move forward dynamically, as we strive for excellence in leadership and 

expertise. The vision of our organisation to revolutionise education is becoming a global reality. In 

Singapore, MindChamps has established its position as the Number One provider of premium 

preschool centres1, and we continue to transform and grow each day.   

 

As the Board of Directors (the “Board”), we recognise the importance of sustainability and seek to 

contribute to our environment and society through our business activities as a responsible corporate 

citizen.  

 

We are supported by the Sustainability Task Force (“STF”), which is comprised of C-suite and senior 

management, to ensure that MindChamps’ sustainability initiatives are aligned with the long-term 

business strategy of taking the MindChamps education movement from Singapore to the world. 

Through the STF, we oversee the management and monitoring of the ESG factors.  

 

This Report outlines MindChamps’ position on integrating sustainability into our strategies and 

operations and provides an overview of our policies and practices and sustainability initiatives and 

performance during the year.

Materiality Assessment 

 

MindChamps conducted a materiality assessment guided by the GRI Materiality Principle.  

 

The objective of the assessment was to identify the ESG factors that are material to both MindChamps’ 

business and our stakeholders.  

 

An external consultant was engaged to facilitate the three-step assessment process which involved 

identifying, prioritising and validating ESG factors that are material to MindChamps.  

 

The assessment process is summarised in the diagram below. 

 

 

Eight material ESG factors were identified as topics that matter most to MindChamps’ business and 

stakeholders. We categorised the material ESG factors as follow:

Sustainability at MindChamps 

 

MindChamps believes that, as a leader in Singapore’s education sector, we should inculcate the right 

values in our students (our “Champs”) and empower them through our curriculum and teaching 

pedagogy. This is a critical consideration for MindChamps as we continue to strengthen our business 

through responsible conduct in all our operations. 

 

We address our material factors across three sustainability pillars, namely Environment, Social and 

Governance. Due to the nature of our business, our approach is focussed on people – who are 

fundamental to the long-term success of MindChamps.  

 

In FY2018, MindChamps accomplished several key milestones and set targets for the coming year to 

drive continuous improvement in the relevant areas.

Environment 

Working towards a sustainable future 

 

MindChamps’ Approach 

Objective 

MindChamps is committed to nurturing our 

Champs through a holistic curriculum in a 

vibrant environment. 

MindChamps’ curriculum nurtures our Champs 

in all aspects of development, preparing them 

for the future from their early learning years. 

 

Sustainability Curriculum and Practices  

 

Anchored by MindChamps’ philosophy of filling the gaps in education systems world-wide, the 

objective of MindChamps’ education model is to prepare the children of today with the skills, flexibility 

and mindset to thrive in a rapidly-changing and information-saturated future, and nurturing every 

child to be the best they can be. 

 

Sustainability is a key global issue in today’s context. Recognising this, MindChamps imparts this 

responsibility in our Champs. MindChamps educates our Champs to interact responsibly with the 

environment through our curriculum, which includes lesson design, class activities, excursions and 

year-end concerts. MindChamps believes that nurturing and instilling a sense of responsibility should 

begin from our Champs’ early childhood. 

 

The MindChamps “Enquiry Approach to Teaching 

and Learning” has a strong focus on environmental 

awareness and sustainability. Three out of the four 

Enquiry themes for each level in MindChamps 

PreSchool are focussed on “Animals”, “Growing 

Things” and “Our World”. Through these Enquiry 

themes, our Champs explore and discover the world 

around them and learn about the importance of 

protecting the earth through environmentally-

friendly practices, such as recycling, responsible 

consumption and practical energy-saving methods. 

Champs also learn about empowerment – the role 

each individual plays in protecting the environment. 

 

 

Use of recycled materials at MindChamps PreSchool centres. 

 

 

Collection of recycled materials  

at MindChamps PreSchool centres. 

MindChamps also believes in leading by example to 

nurture and encourage behavioural changes that 

positively impact the environment. MindChamps 

teachers and employees practice the 3Rs – Reduce, 

Reuse and Recycle in their daily activities at 

MindChamps PreSchool.  

 

Our teachers encourage our Champs to collect used 

materials such as bottles, aluminium cans and 

newspapers to decorate the classrooms as well as 

for their arts and crafts projects. This initiative 

exposes our Champs to sustainable practices, sparks 

their learning interest and inculcates recycling habits 

in them from their early learning years.

Our Enquiry curriculum introduces topics such as biodiversity and wildlife preservation to our Champs.  

 

 

 

Our Champs learn about endangered animals and also showcase their works made from recycled paper products. 

 

The learning about sustainability and environmental protection culminates in year-end concerts for 

all our MindChamps PreSchool centres. Our Champs’ performances are based on a common theme – 

saving the Earth and promoting the ideals of environmental protection.

Social 

Growing together with our people and the community 

 

MindChamps’ Approach 

Objective 

MindChamps’ growth and success are firmly 

anchored on education quality and sound 

people and stakeholder management.  

A dynamic business that responds proactively 

to the expectations of its stakeholders helps 

MindChamps to stay ahead in the preschool 

landscape. 

 

Interaction with Stakeholders 

 

MindChamps recognises the importance of interacting with our stakeholders to build their 

understanding of MindChamps’ business. MindChamps regularly interacts and connects with our 

stakeholders through various engagement methods. These engagements aim to build and strengthen 

the trust in MindChamps’ brand and create long-term value for both MindChamps and our 

stakeholders. 

 

This section describes MindChamps’ interactions with four key stakeholder groups; (1) customers, (2) 

media, (3) shareholders and analysts, and (4) employees, as they each have a major influence on 

MindChamps’ success, and are in turn, impacted by MindChamps.   

 

Customers 

 

Understanding our customers is key to ensuring that MindChamps, and our Champs and their parents 

(“MindChamps parents”) develop a long-standing relationship.  

 

To deepen our understanding of MindChamps parents, we conduct surveys twice a year called the 

MindChamps PreSchool Parents’ Survey (“Parents’ Survey”). The Parents’ Survey aims to capture and 

understand the satisfaction level of MindChamps parents. The results drive continuous improvement 

in engaging with our customers.  

 

Based on the latest results of the Parents’ Survey, MindChamps achieved the following results: 

• 

more than 75% of MindChamps parents responded to the Parents Survey; 

• 

97% of respondents rated ‘Excellent’ or ‘Good’ on their Champs’ overall educational 

experience and development at MindChamps; and 

• 

93% of respondents rated ‘Excellent’ or ‘Good’ for the bi-annual PTCs. 

 

To facilitate continuous interaction with our customers, we conduct Parent-Teacher Conferences 

(“PTCs”) and also implemented a MindChamps Application (“MindChamps App”).   

 

PTCs are held at the end of every semester. The PTCs not only provide a platform for our teachers to 

update MindChamps parents on their Champs’ learning journeys, but also allow MindChamps parents 

to provide feedback on MindChamps’ curriculum and practices. This iterative, 360-degree platform 

facilitates effective and meaningful dialogue.  

 

The MindChamps App is a mobile application that was specially designed for MindChamps parents to 

participate in and celebrate their Champs’ growth and progress. Our teachers provide updates on our 

Champs’ educational development through the ‘My Learning Curriculum’ function on the 

MindChamps App. Furthermore, the MindChamps App enables MindChamps to continually 


 

 

 

 

 

 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2018

strengthen the parent-centre partnership to nurture the best potential in all our Champs. It enables 

our teachers and MindChamps parents to foster two-way communications and easily exchange 

information about their Champs. Our teachers also recognise the importance of personal interaction 

and carry out good practices by greeting and meeting MindChamps parents every day when they come 

to the centres and sharing verbal updates regarding their Champs. 

 

Media 

 

The media plays an important role in communicating accurate information on MindChamps in their 

publications to a wider audience. The media also helps to widen exposure opportunities for 

MindChamps’ brands and products.  

 

MindChamps’ Corporate Communications team is responsible for overseeing both public relations and 

media relations for MindChamps, carries out media monitoring and engagement and issues media 

releases.  

 

The Corporate Communications team conducts monthly interactive sessions with its media partners. 

During the year, the team met with at least 10 media partners. Every year during Children’s Day, the 

team also conducts a media drop 4 to celebrate the occasion. The annual media drop is one of 

MindChamps’ ways of interacting with editors and journalists to build their understanding of 

MindChamps.  

 

 

 

During a media drop event on Children’s Day 2018, MindChamps’ employees met up with and engaged with editorial staff. 

MindChamps mascots, Luv &amp; Lyte, also made appearances. 

 

Shareholders and Analysts 

 

MindChamps is committed to providing shareholders with adequate, timely and sufficient information 

pertaining to changes in MindChamps’ business, guided by the SGX-ST Listing Manual and the Code of 

Corporate Governance. 

 

Announcements are disseminated to shareholders via SGXNet and uploaded on MindChamps’ 

corporate website. Shareholders may also subscribe to our email alerts for instant notification of such 

announcements. Shareholders may contact MindChamps’ Investor Relations team or our Lead 

Independent Director, through the channels set out on MindChamps’ corporate website.

A media drop is a public relations term that involves arranging to have a celebrity, spokesperson or mascot “drop 

in” on a radio or TV station.

The MindChamps AGM 

 

The AGM is held annually to engage with 

MindChamps' shareholders. Shareholders are strongly 

encouraged to participate in the AGM to understand 

more about MindChamps’ business activities and 

financial performance. At MindChamps’ AGMs, we 

endeavour to provide a unique and refreshing 

experience, in line with MindChamps’ culture and 

industry, by incorporating an icebreaking activity to 

kick-start the meeting. 

 

 

MindChamps’ AGM on 16 April 2018. 

 

 

RHB’s Undiscovered Gems Conference on 15 October 2018. 

MindChamps 

regularly 

invites 

analysts 

to 

meetings 

after 

our 

quarterly 

financial 

announcements. At these meetings, our Chief 

Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial 

Officer (“CFO”) share MindChamps’ business 

performance, which enables analysts to have a 

deeper 

understanding 

about 

MindChamps’ 

operating models and financial performance. This 

helps to create more public awareness about 

MindChamps’ business and presence, through the 

publications published by the analysts. Materials 

presented at these meetings are also made 

available on SGXNet and MindChamps’ corporate 

website.  

 

In 2018, MindChamps participated in RHB’s 

Undiscovered Gems Conference, which was 

attended by 32 fund managers and analysts. Our 

CEO, CFO and the senior management team were 

present at the conference to interact with the 

attendees. MindChamps actively participates in 

such events to engage and reach out to a wider 

range of stakeholders to share about our global 

movement.  

 

Employees 

 

MindChamps is in a people-centric industry and regards its employees as a key stakeholder group to 

drive the success of MindChamps. For more information on our initiatives relating to communications 

with our employees, please refer to the material ESG factor “Talent Retention” below.  

 

 






 

 

 

 

 

 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2018

Talent Retention 

 

MindChamps places great importance on talent retention. The ability to attract and retain candidates 

who fit MindChamps’ culture will positively impact MindChamps’ business. Longer-term employees 

would have acquired essential knowledge and established relationships with industry players. Hence, 

it is MindChamps’ objective to retain these talents, in order to facilitate sustainable growth. 

 

Retention 

 

A set of policies and processes has been established with the purpose of retaining talents. The policies 

are embedded in MindChamps’ Employee Handbook and provide guidance over matters such as 

working hours, leave entitlement, code of conduct and employee benefits. Employees are encouraged 

to approach the Human Resource (“HR”) department on any concerns that they may have regarding 

HR policies and practices.  

 

To retain employees, MindChamps strives to create a welcoming culture. Staff meetings called “Pow 

Wow” meetings are organised around once every quarter. During such “Pow Wow” meetings, new 

employees are introduced, and business updates are shared with all employees. Team activities are 

also held during such meetings. For example, employees from different departments are assigned to 

groups to create and perform short skits exemplifying MindChamps’ six core themes, namely 

“Consistency”, “Realistic”, “Excellence”, “Accountability”, “Teamwork” and “Energy” (CREATE). 

CREATE is MindChamps’ backbone to shape a fun workplace environment for employees to feel 

motivated and committed to work at MindChamps. The skit competitions also greatly encourage 

bonding and facilitate smoother business interactions between different departments.  

 

Additionally, annual teachers’ retreats are organised for our teachers from all MindChamps PreSchool 

centres. These retreats are organised to appreciate our teachers’ passion and commitment in 

educating and nurturing our Champs. The retreats also provide opportunities for our teachers to bond 

and share their experiences and best practices with one another.

As part of MindChamps’ retention initiatives, the HR department also conducts exit interviews with 

resignees to understand the reasons that may have caused them to resign. The HR department then 

looks into concerns raised during such interviews.

Engagement 

 

To constantly be in tune with the pulse of our 

employees, 

MindChamps 

conducts 

annual 

employee surveys for our teachers and corporate 

staff to engage and understand employee 

satisfaction. From the FY2018 annual employee 

survey, both our corporate staff and teachers 

ranked MindChamps’ employee engagement index 

above the national benchmark of 4.64 published by 

the Singapore Workforce Engagement Study in 

2017. The results from the surveys are used to 

identify issues that our employees may have. The 

HR department works towards addressing these 

issues as MindChamps is driven by the objective of 

increasing employee engagement and satisfaction 

and, in turn, increasing the retention of talent that 

is key to drive and support our business and 

operations. 

 

MindChamps WOW Award 

 

The WOW Award recognises employees 

who excel in their performance and 

rewards them for their continuous 

contributions to MindChamps' success. 

Their performance is assessed based on 

values 

such 

as 

“Heart”, 

“Service 

Excellence”, 

“Commitment” 

and 

Teamwork”. The Heads of Departments 

will rate and nominate employees who 

excel in these areas. Employees who 

receive the WOW Award will be awarded 

a certificate and a monetary reward of 

S$200 to S$300. This award also 

motivates employees to strive for further 

excellence in their work. 

 

MindChamps is also committed to ensuring that work performance requirements are met and that 

our employees progress in their careers. Performance appraisals are conducted annually, reinforced 

with regular feedback to identify talent gaps, training needs and promotion opportunities, as well as 

to strengthen relationships between MindChamps and our employees. To encourage life-long learning, 

MindChamps provides four days of Learning and Development leave annually for employees to attend 

courses that are relevant to their work. 

 

As a result of our robust internal HR policies and processes, MindChamps received the inaugural 2018 

Influential Brands® Top Employer award, scoring above national benchmarks in our efforts and 

initiatives to engage employees. 

 

Organisational Culture 

 

Consistent with MindChamps’ brand philosophy, it is our belief that a brand is not simply expressed 

in a logo, packaging, typography or product. Rather, it is an amalgamation of personality and 

experience where organisational culture plays a key factor in truly defining MindChamps’ 

distinctiveness as a brand. 

 

The HR department has recently implemented an upgraded annual performance appraisal framework 

and system for employees, whereby 10% of the performance score will involve an assessment of the 

employee’s exemplification of MindChamps’ 5 Core Values, namely “Heart”, “Integrity”, “Prosperity”, 

“Growth” and “Expansion”, to ensure that our Core Values are deeply embedded throughout the 

whole organisation and to create a positive organisational culture for our employees. This is in line 

with MindChamps’ drive to establish its presence across the globe anchored by these core values. 

With this enhancement, MindChamps’ core values will be continuously assessed for alignment 

throughout the organisation.

Quality of Education System5 

 

MindChamps’ 3-Mind education model prepares the children of today with the skills, flexibility and 

mindset to thrive in a rapidly-changing and information-saturated future. The model strives to nurture 

every child to be the best that they can be by focussing on the skills and strategies of learning. The 

model emphasises the teaching of the ‘how’ rather than the ‘what’ to learn. The 3-Mind concept was 

conceived alongside international experts, including world-renowned neuroscientist, Professor 

Emeritus Allan Snyder FRS. MindChamps’ unique approach draws inspiration and research from the 

domains of Neuroscience, Child Psychology and Theatre, synthesising them with education theory and 

practice. 

 

The 3-Mind Education Model  

 

 

 

MindChamps delivers, through “S.M.I.L.E.S”, an environment of engagement, security, nurturing and 

exploration. This prepares the brain for optimal growth and anticipates the future development of the 

3 Minds. The acronym S.M.I.L.E.S. stands for: Sensory, Motor (Music and Movement), Intellectual, 

Linguistic, Emotional and Social. The S.M.I.L.E.S. principle acknowledges that brains, in their formative 

stages, need all aspects of mind-stimulation simultaneously and that all types of activities have the 

potential to engage all of the S.M.I.L.E.S. elements. 

 

MindChamps teachers develop weekly Enquiry teaching and learning lesson cycles that best exemplify 

our philosophy of the 3 Minds and S.M.I.L.E.S. The Enquiry approach begins with active provocation 

by the teachers to stimulate our Champs’ interests and curiosity that sets them on active learning 

journeys. The various provocation methods applied range from books, images, games, to living things 

such as plants to appeal to the different learning styles of our Champs. This is aligned with the 

S.M.I.L.E.S elements.   

 

The Champion Mind 

 

The Champion Mind is actively nurtured through the 10 values of a MindChampion and our teachers 

elaborate on these values through purposeful and incidental teachable moments. Through Enquiry, 

our Champs learn about discovering their own voice, personal creativity and self-expression – all these 

elements are reflective of the Champion Mind.

The Learning Mind 

 

Through provocation and discovery, the Learning Mind is tapped and nurtured. Our Champs embark 

on learning through crafted play that uses all forms of manipulatives, games and other creative 

learning resources. Crafted play allows our Champs to have a ‘hands-on’ approach to learning and 

discovery. Furthermore, MindChamps teachers observe and document the interests of our Champs 

and design lessons which allow our Champs to further pursue their interests.   

 

The Creative Mind 

 

The Creative Mind is developed through various platforms. A key platform is the documenting of our 

Champs’ learning in the Enquiry Approach to Teaching and Learning. The Creative Mind is about 

nurturing self-expression, unique viewpoints and the mindset of listening and accepting the 

viewpoints of others. MindChamps teachers adopt various lesson strategies to encourage our Champs 

to demonstrate their learning through unique pieces of work as opposed to cookie-cutter works. 

Below are specific examples of our Champs’ works that demonstrate unique viewpoints. Each work 

showcases a statement by the Champs because they are encouraged to reflect on their works and 

articulate these reflections – to encourage their own voice.

PreSchool Environment 

 

At MindChamps PreSchool centres, each class is managed by one English language teacher and one 

Chinese language teacher who jointly educate our Champs through the daily curriculum. This provides 

our Champs with the learning opportunity to be effectively bilingual and nurture their interest in both 

languages from young.  

 

To further facilitate a conducive learning environment and have a greater alignment to the 3-Mind 

Education Model, all MindChamps PreSchool classrooms are designed with six learning zones – 

Dramatic, Construction, Art and Craft, Reading, Writing and Numeracy. These learning zones are 

designed with the objective of promoting imagination and learning.  

 

MindChamps HQ provides a yearly Enquiry 

Theme Guide to all MindChamps PreSchool 

centres. A set of 16 Curriculum Folders which 

provides 

comprehensive 

details 

of 

MindChamps’ curriculum and pedagogy as 

well as how the classroom space should be set 

up, is also communicated to and rolled out at 

all MindChamps PreSchool centres. These 

folders include lesson planning templates for 

integrated activities to drive the Enquiry 

Approach to Teaching and Learning.  

 

MindChamps’ curriculum is the result of over a 

decade of research and development in the 

three 

domains 

of 

Neuroscience, 

Child 

Psychology and Theatre. Our curriculum 

nurtures all aspects of our Champs and 

includes world proprietary academic and 

enrichment programmes.

Quality Assurance  

 

To 

ensure 

that 

our 

MindChamps 

PreSchool centres are operating at the 

highest 

standards, 

a 

ChampionGold 

Standard site visit is conducted annually. 

This audit reviews the teaching and 

learning conducted at each of our centres, 

as well as the centre’s overall operations 

and the experience of MindChamps 

parents and our Champs. Following the 

site audit for each centre, MindChamps 

HQ follows up with a report and feedback 

session. MindChamps PreSchool centres 

then use this report to formulate and 

carry out improvement plans.

Quality of Teachers  

 

To deliver MindChamps’ curriculum, it is crucial that our teachers develop the right mindsets, values 

and skills and are equipped with the right tools. 

 

MindChamps teachers are required to attend training of up to 200 hours to enhance their skills in 

areas such as coaching, tools for engagement, positive guidance as well as MindChamps’ curriculum 

within three months of onboarding.

MindChamps’ teacher training includes: 

• 

Three overarching areas 

▪ 

MindChamps Way Culture and Pedagogy 

▪ 

Specialisation (Core) 

▪ 

Enrichment 

• 

Staff Development and Training (“SDT”) Days 

• 

Ad-hoc training by MindChamps HQ 

 

Annually, all our teachers are also required to undergo two full days of SDT organised by MindChamps 

HQ and one full day of SDT organised by the centres. The SDTs provide a platform to share the best 

pedagogical practices and to reflect on MindChamps’ culture and values, including training from our 

CEO and MindChamps World Advisory Board members. 

 

During the MindChamps SDT day in September 2018, Mr Brian Caswell, our Dean of Research, shared 

his deep insights on MindChamps’ curriculum in comparison to the other great movements in early 

childhood education. Mr Caswell also highlighted our competitive edge in incorporating innovations 

in teaching and learning in order to lead to the development of strong foundations for life-long 

learning and future success.  

 

During that same event, Dr Larry Scripp, our Dean of Music Education, shared about his innovative 

approach to music education using Music and Music Integration. Through his sharing, MindChamps 

teachers learnt that music can be used as another curricular language to engage our young learners.

Health and Safety6 

 

MindChamps is responsible for the safety and well-being of thousands of young children. MindChamps 

is also mindful of the need to create a safe workplace for our employees.  

 

MindChamps undertakes robust measures to ensure the safety of our Champs and employees. In 

addition to complying with the local laws and regulations, various policies have been established by 

MindChamps to address both Occupational Health and Safety and Preschool Health and Safety.  

 

 

MindChamps HQ has established a health and safety committee in compliance with the Workplace 

Safety and Health Act and maintains a WSH Policy as guidance in creating a safe environment for our 

Champs and employees. An SOP on Incident Management and Reporting has been established to 

ensure prompt reporting and investigation of incidents concerning safety. Regular checks are 

conducted at MindChamps HQ and PreSchool centres to identify any areas of potential safety risk. 

Operational risks are also reviewed in an effort to reduce and eliminate risks, where possible. 

Maintenance is scheduled regularly for properties such as elevators, escalators and stairwells, and 

hazards identified (if any) which cannot be eliminated are well signposted. 

 

All MindChamps teachers attend child first aid courses and are certified first aiders. They are trained 

to observe and identify medical conditions in our Champs and to take the necessary actions such as 

providing first aid and contacting the relevant emergency response teams. It is critical to ensure that 

our Champs receive the appropriate attention during an emergency. In addition, each centre has a 

safety team comprising teachers and admin staff who are assigned to ensure that health and safety 

measures are upheld at the centre, which include periodic checks on the expiry dates and the stock 

up of first aid kits and fire extinguishers. Each centre also has a fire warden to lead fire-drill exercises 

and safe evacuations in the event of an actual fire outbreak.

Furthermore, MindChamps PreSchools are regularly audited for health and safety to ensure 

compliance with licensing requirements. To ensure the safety of our Champs, audits are conducted 

through the MindChamps ChampionGold Standard framework. The MindChamps safety manager 

conducts bi-annual spot checks, carries out timely investigation and implements preventive and 

corrective actions when incidents are reported. Preschool equipment such as toys and playgrounds 

are cleaned daily and maintained and upgraded annually. Our centres also ensure that our Champs of 

different age groups are provided with age-appropriate toys.  

 

MindChamps 

takes 

pride 

in 

providing 

a 

safe 

learning 

environment for our Champs. For 

example, one of the key safety 

features that MindChamps upholds 

strictly is the installation of door 

guards in all our centres. This 

minimises 

the 

risk 

of 

doors 

accidently closing on our Champs.  

Walking Feet Campaign  

 

Our Champs are reminded to use their ‘walking feet’ 

when moving about in MindChamps PreSchool centres 

and not to run within the premises. MindChamps instils 

safe behaviours in our Champs and encourages them to 

be responsible for their own safety as well as the safety 

of their peers and teachers through positive guidance 

and fun activities.  

 

Health and safety trainings are provided to both our Champs and employees to educate them on the 

potential health risks and safety hazards at MindChamps HQ and PreSchool centres, and the proper 

precautions to take. Additionally, fire evacuation drills are conducted for our Champs and employees 

at least once every six months to increase their awareness and preparedness in case of an emergency. 

Due to our robust health and safety processes in place, no serious work-related incidents were 

recorded in FY2018. 

 

MindChamps Parents’ Survey Highlights

Local Communities 

 

MindChamps is committed to investing in local communities to drive positive change and to support 

communities in need.  

 

MindChamps’ approach to supporting local communities is two-pronged. At the corporate level, 

MindChamps is committed to creating educational opportunities where they would not otherwise 

exist. At the level of each MindChamps PreSchool, the initiatives undertaken to support local 

communities are guided by MindChamps’ ten values of a MindChampion that are instilled in our 

Champs.  

 

In FY2018, MindChamps organised various community engagement programmes that positively 

impacted the lives of the beneficiaries throughout the year. The table below highlights some of our 

programmes conducted during the year.  

 

 

 

Showing Compassion through 

Adoption of Endangered Tree 

Kangaroos 

 

Our Champs raised S$30,000 to 

adopt two rare and endangered 

Goodfellow’s tree kangaroos – 

Makaia and Nupela. This act of 

kindness from our Champs is 

reflective 

of 

the 

“I 

am 

Compassionate” value nurtured 

in our Champs. 

 

 

 

Donation of 250 ‘The Magic 

Coin Purse’ Books 

 

MindChamps gifted 250 books 

titled ‘The Magic Coin Purse’ to 

the children at the South 

Central 

Community 

Family 

Service Centre in conjunction 

with Christmas 2018.

Senior Activity Centres 

 

Our Champs joined seniors in 

activity 

centres 

at 

Redhill, 

Taman Jurong, Bukit Merah and 

Lengkok Bahru to spread cheer 

and joy. Our Champs worked on 

arts and craft together with the 

seniors, that were then put up 

for sale to raise funds for NTUC 

Health SilverACE. Our Champs 

also put up performances for 

the seniors, much to their 

delight.

Governance 

Building trust and confidence in our preschools 

 

MindChamps’ Approach 

Objective 

MindChamps’ business conduct is underpinned 

by our robust internal corporate governance 

practices. 

Good corporate governance is the foundation 

of operational excellence and financial 

performance, delivering value to all 

stakeholders. 

 

Regulatory Compliance 

 

Good corporate governance is essential to operate in the regulated preschool sector as it safeguards 

MindChamps from risk and reputational damage. It is also key to building customer confidence, loyalty 

and trust.  

 

In view of the various regulations that govern preschools, MindChamps institutes policies to guide its 

operations. MindChamps also regularly reviews these policies to ensure that they are kept up to date.  

 

In addition to having policies as overarching governance, MindChamps PreSchool centre leaders 

conduct self-assessment in compliance with the Early Childhood Development Agency’s (“ECDA”) 

licensing requirements. A compliance audit is carried out by MindChamps HQ one month prior to the 

ECDA licensing officer’s renewal assessment visit. Meetings are regularly held with business leaders 

to communicate and align ECDA’s licensing requirements and Code of Practice with centre operations 

and practices. 

 

MindChamps also takes a serious stance on ensuring that our franchisees comply with regulations and 

uphold our values, so that our brand and curriculum are not compromised. MindChamps has in place 

a robust compliance audit framework for our franchisees. An annual compliance audit is carried out 

on every franchisee by an independent service provider. Through the audit process, issues are 

identified and follow up actions are reported to MindChamps HQ and the franchisee. Our teams work 

closely with franchisees to resolve any issues identified and constantly improve on operations. Due to 

the framework in place and annual checks on our franchisees, no significant issues were reported in 

FY2018. 

 

MindChamps endeavours to continue to operate to the highest standards in compliance with the 

relevant laws and regulations.
