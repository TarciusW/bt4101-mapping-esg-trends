4. CONTRIBUTIONS TO UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE 

DEVELOPMENT GOALS  

Haw Par has a long history of contributing to local communities in regions where the company 

conducts business. As we bring health and wellbeing to the people we serve through our innovative 

products and solutions, we are committed to giving back to society and upholding environmental 

protection and conservation. 

 

As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to impact societies, we reinforced on our commitment to support 

our global communities through donations of Tiger Balm products to those in need, as well as those 

at the frontlines. Vulnerable groups in Singapore that received our support included elderly at nursing 

homes and dementia day care centres. Working through NGOs, Tiger Balm care packs were given out 

to a broad spectrum of frontliners – from migrant workers to baggage and trolley handlers at Changi 

Airport. In Thailand and Vietnam, Tiger Balm care packs were presented to healthcare professionals 

at some 30 hospitals in Bangkok and key cities in Thailand, and 10 hospitals in Vietnam. In addition to 

public hospitals, our products were also distributed to healthcare teams in Singapore caring for at-risk 

groups at hospices and charitable dialysis centres. Tiger Balm Care Packs were also given out to lower-

wage workers in Singapore through Chemical Industries Employees’ Union’s “Gift from the Heart” 

outreach to members. In Sweden and India, our teams came together to raise funds for charitable 

causes. 

 

We believe that no one should be constrained from leading an active life, and sport is a force for 

wellbeing and empowerment. Since 2015, the Group has been supporting athletes from Singapore 

Disability Sports Council (SDSC). In 2021, our contribution of $120,000 benefitted SDSC in key areas of 

the development pathway, such as coaching, organisation of local competitions, participation in 

overseas competitions, nurturing young talent and education programmes. We funded the Boccia 

Team, Tiger Balm National Youth Individual Boccia Trials, Tiger Balm WeHeartBoccia Community 

Outreach, National Youth Para Championships (Swimming &amp; Athletics), Singapore Disability Sports 

Awards and more. Flag bearer for Team Singapore at the Bahrain 2021 Asian Youth Para Games (AYPG) 

- Aloysius Gan won the Gold medal for Boccia BC3 Men's Individual Event, Singapore’s first ever Boccia 

medal at the AYPG. Our support for SDSC has contributed to the growth of para sports in Singapore, 

enabling more to live healthier, active lives. 

 

As a company that contributes to the health and wellbeing of our consumers, we appreciate that we 

can only be as healthy as the planet we live in, and we continue to explore ways to contribute to 

biodiversity conservation and education. As the tiger and leopard are the namesakes of Haw Par and 

our founders, we have been sponsoring the Malayan Tiger Exhibit and the Leopard Exhibit at the Night 

Safari and the Singapore Zoo since 1995 and 1986 respectively. In 2021, we further extended our 

sponsorship through our adoption of the twin Malayan tiger cubs born at Night Safari. This was the 

first successful birth of the critically endangered Malayan tiger at the attractions in 23 years. On 

International Tiger Day, the pair was named via a public online vote. They serve as ambassadors for 

their wild counterparts, helping to raise awareness on the need to protect these animals and their 

natural habitats. In line with our Blue Mission to inspire, educate and conserve, Underwater World 

Pattaya introduces the public to its showcase of various species of aquatic life onsite and online.  

 

Staying committed to our environmental cause, we have taken direct action over the years to increase 

the recycled content in our packaging materials for Tiger Balm products. Since 2011, we have switched 

to using paper with recycled paper content for our boxes for majority of our Tiger Balm products. We 

are continuously working with our vendors to reduce the usage of packaging materials. Going forward, 

we will continue to explore ways to incorporate the 3Rs of Reduce, Reuse, Recycle into our business 

operations, as we source for efficient solutions to minimise our environmental footprint.
