BOARD STATEMENT

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) is pleased to present the third

Sustainability Report of BlackGold Natural Resources Limited (“BlackGold”

or the “Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) for the

financial year ended 31 December (“FY”) 2019. This report presents the

Group’s policies, practices and performance in relation to sustainability and

was prepared in accordance with the SGX Sustainability Reporting Guide

and Global Reporting Initiative (Core) Standards.

 

During the reporting period, there were no significant changes in the scale of

coal production and operation of the Group as compared to previous year.

BlackGold remains committed and focused on fostering its relationship with

the local communities and ensure that the Group’s activities are conducted in

a socially and environmentally responsible manner.

 

Indonesia is a nation abundant in natural resources and has increasing

energy demands to fuel the country’s continued economic growth. Fueled by

Indonesia’s economic progress, urbanisation and a growing middle class

have  accelerated the  need  for  greater access to electricity across the

archipelago. Demand for electricity is expected to rise, as the country’s

political and business leaders begin to prioritise energy, infrastructure and

electrification, of which coal is an integral part of, in the immediate future.

 

At BlackGold, we believe in building a sustainable business that not only

delivers long-term value to our stakeholders but one which commits to

sustainable considerations to our mining practices. To be a part of the future

of Indonesia’s power generation,  we must first protect its future. The Group

also continue to uphold its pledge to provide a safe and healthy work

environment for all our employees and contractors.

 

Sustainability is at the heart of our business practices and operational

considerations.  We place health and safety as our ultimate priority, ensuring

that we are environmentally responsible in our operations and are committed

to respecting human rights and supporting our host communities.  As the

Group embarks on its growth journey, we are committed to ensuring that we

operate sustainably and that our presence creates positive impacts for our

employees, as well as the local communities. We strive to continuously

improve our sustainability performance and mature in our sustainability

reporting journey over time.

 

BlackGold is committed to complying with the prevailing laws and regulations

of the jurisdictions in  which it operates. Where the local jurisdiction’s

regulatory requirements are less stringent than our own, we continue to

uphold the Group’s own standards of legal and regulatory compliance.

Sustainability is addressed at the highest levels at BlackGold. The Board oversees

the sustainability approach – assisting with governance and close monitoring. We

believe a high standard of governance is critical to the implementation of our

strategy, as well as the achievement of targets for long-term success. The Board

recognizes the significance of adopting sustainable practices and how it could

improve our business operations and performance. To that end, the Board strikes a

right balance between financial results, social engagement and environmental

stewardship in our strategic formulation.

Under the guidance and oversight of the Board, the Group’s Management works

closely with its staff and employees to identify, manage and monitor material

environmental, social and governance ("ESG") factors relevant to our business and

our stakeholders. The ESG data and information provided have not been verified by

an independent third party. We have relied on internal data monitoring and

verification to ensure accuracy.

The primary duties of the Board include providing leadership on BlackGold’s overall

strategy, taking into consideration any sustainability issues that may arise and

ensure the adequacy of the Group’s framework for risk management and internal

controls.

Our employees work diligently with the Management to identify and manage material

risks across our business activities, functions and processes through our internal

risk management standards. This allows us to consistently apply  a  risk-

based approach in our business considerations and operations. All material risks 

are assessed  alongside careful consideration of the potential health, safety,

environmental, 

community, 

reputational, 

legal 

and 

financial

impacts. 

By 

incorporating 

risk 

management 

into 

all 

our work processes and critical business systems, we ensure that decisions are

made based on relevant inputs and valid data.

The Audit Committee assesses the design and effectiveness of our risk management

processes and systems annually. These audit results are used to generate detailed

management plans to address and identify gaps. Key findings are then reported and

highlighted to the Board, which manages oversight of the Group’s systems of risk

management. At the business unit level, economic, operational as well as health

and safety issues and other risks are reported to - and reviewed by the Operations

Director in the Indonesia office.

A broader discussion of our risks factors and management approach will be provided

in the “Corporate Governance” section of the 2019 Annual Report.

OUR

PERFORMANCE

BlackGold is an Indonesian-focused coal mining company targeting Indonesia’s rapidly-

growing power plant industry, with a specific focus on supplying coal to power plants located

in Riau province, Sumatra, Indonesia.

 

The Group holds the mining rights to a coal concession in Sumatra, PT Samantaka Batubara

(“PT SB”), covering approximately 15,000 hectares in acreage (“PT SB Concession”). The

Group has, to date, explored a total area of approximately 10,000 hectares in the PT SB

concession.

 

The Group is listed on the Catalist board of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading

(“SGX-ST”).

 

The listing was subsequent to the acquisitions of the entire issued and paid up share capital

of BlackGold Asia Resources Pte. Ltd. and BlackGold Energy Limited as well as their

respective subsidiaries, which was completed on 10 March 2015. Since 2017, the Group has

been a member in the Association of Catalist Companies (“ACC”).

 

There has been no material change in the Group’s coal resources and reserves since they

were last reported in the Independent Qualified Person’s Report dated 1 November 2019. As

at 31 December 2019, the Group, through its subsidiary PT SB has an estimated total of 110

million tonnes of Coal Resources and 12.5 million tonnes of Coal Reserves for an effective

date of 31 December 2019 (reported in compliance with JORC 2012).

 

Based on the unaudited financial statements for FY2019, the Group recorded net revenue of

US$11,033,991 and produced approximately 0.35 million tonnes of coal.

ADDRESING

YOUR CONCERNS


MATERIALITY

Understanding materiality is the foundation of sustainability 

reporting. The materiality analysis and assessment framework

allows BlackGold to develop a robust understanding of what

issues are material to the Group’s operations, the environment

and communities that act as barriers or enablers to achieving

our business goals in the short, medium and long term. In

doing so, the management team is able to prevent or mitigate 

these risks and gain access to opportunities which will allow 

us to  successfully  deliver our  business  strategy, while  also 

meeting our shareholders’ expectations for value in our 

developed  assets.

04

We define our material sustainability matters as ESG matters

that have significant impact to our business and stakeholders.

Determination of material aspects and priority topics for

presentation in this report is based on a 2016 GRI publication,

“Defining What Matters” as guidance to strike a balance

between key issues that the Group would like to highlight and

areas in which stakeholders would prefer to have greater

visibility of.

In FY2019, we have reviewed the material ESG matters

identified in FY2018 and are of the view that the they remain

relevant in FY2019. The identified 8 (eight) key focus areas

hold high relevance to the global sustainability challenges that

the Group faces throughout its operational processes. As we

embark on our growth journey, we plan to reassess our

material sustainability matters and to progressively disclose a

wider and more in-depth focus on material sustainability

matters in the next reporting period.

BLACKGOLD NATURAL RESOURCES LIMITED | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

To understand what matters to our company, first we need to

listen to the voice of our stakeholders. The process begins with

an internal meeting between the management and each

respective Head of Departments to identify the materiality

aspects for the report. This is followed by circulated

questionnaires to various senior members of departments such

as Mining and Exploration, Sales and Marketing, Human

Resources, as well as Finance and Accounting, Their feedback

represents the voice of internal stakeholders. The Group also

conducted surveys to get input from our external stakeholders

including our customers, vendors, and local communities.

WATER 

MANAGEMENT



Water usage plays an essential function in our Group’s

operations, and is a scarce and valuable resources. As

such, we recognise the importance of managing the

consumption of water at our Jakarta Head Office (“Jakarta

HO”), as well as at the PT SB mining site.

 

In FY2019, there were no reports or complaints on

incidents related to the use of water nor any environmental

harm caused to water bodies in the vicinity of our mining

areas.

 

The Jakarta HO has deployed automatic shut off water

faucets in the restrooms to minimise water usage. At the

Jakarta HO and at the PT SB mining site, water is used

effectively and recycled wherever possible to optimise the

usage of water and reduce the impact on the environment.

 

The Group is unable to provide a reliable estimate of its

total water usage for FY2019 as the costs and quantity of

water usage at its Jakarta HO is not separable from the

monthly office rental costs, and therefore unable to be

separately monitored. At the PT SB mining concession,

water is drawn from natural aquifer wells, therefore there is

no practicable way of calculating how much water is used

at the mine site.

 

Moving into FY2020, BlackGold shall continue to

accelerate its search for more ways to minimise and

conserve water usage, within our permissible boundaries.

BLACKGOLD NATURAL RESOURCES LIMITED | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

Waste, whether in the form of liquids, solids or

effluents, is generated in the course of our

mining activities. The storage, transportation,

and disposal of waste can potentially cause

serious harm to human health and the

surrounding environment, should such activities

be conducted without the necessary resources

to foresee, and prevent any potential damage.

 

As 

such, 

the 

Group 

recognises 

waste

management as a material factor in our

sustainability reporting and strives to improve

our waste handling processes year on year.

 

At the PT SB concession, the Group has put in

place a waste management policy at the mining

operational 

area. 

A 

settling 

pond 

was

constructed to eliminate acid water seepage

from the mine and ensure proper water

drainage. This pond is also used to neutralise

the pH level in the water prior to being

discharged. The waste from our mining areas is

primarily disposed of at our own facilities.

 

Mineral waste, mainly consisting of overburden

and waste rock, remains at the site where it is

generated. Reusable by-products of our mining

operations 

such 

as 

topsoil 

are 

stored

separately and protected from erosion to be

used for the rehabilitation of the mined-out

area.

WASTE 

MANAGEMENT

In FY2018, the Group had devised a plan to

improve the storage and disposal of sand,

gravel, cement and zinc. During 2019, the plan

has been realized with the installation of a

concrete base for storage and disposal of sand,

gravel, cement and zinc carried out by hoarding

into the ground.

 

The variance in the amount of waste produced

in FY2017, FY2018 and FY2019, as shown

below, is mainly due to the reasonable wear

and tear of our equipment that requires more

regular maintenance and servicing, which in

turn leads to more waste being produced as an

unintended 

result. 

Composition 

of 

Waste

Contributon in FY2019 is 100% from mining

operations whereas in FY2017 and FY2018 the

composition are 90% from mining operations

and 5% each from land clearing and coal

hauling, respctively.

 

Moving forward, the Group will spend more

time on researching for ways to minimise the

amount of waste generated, and to discover

new methods to manage waste in a sustainable

manner.

Electrical power is essential for every part of our lives, as such, we recognise the critical

importance of using energy with careful consideration and efficiency so as to ensure

that there will be ample energy to run our mining operations and for future generations

to come.

 

Management is the driving force behind enforcing energy saving policies and practices

set out by the Group. This stance is emphasised to the employees regularly and

sessions to improve employees’ awareness of environmental issues are held whenever

possible.

 

At BlackGold’s Jakarta HO and at the mining site office, electricity is to be switched off

after working hours at 6.00 pm, unless there is overtime work that requires the use of

electricity. All electronic devices are also to be switched off when not in use.  The

effective use of energy will translate into greater productivity. Notwithstanding, we

should not be saving energy at the sacrifice of effectiveness and efficiency. 

 

As shown in the table below, as compared to FY2017 and FY2018, the Group managed

to reduce its energy consumption during FY2019.



ENERGY CONSUMPTION

Moving forward, the Company targets to produce better results, in terms of reporting

gradually decreasing energy consumption, year on year, to the best of our ability.

GHG EMISSION

As a coal mining company,

BlackGold 

recognises 

the

impacts 

its 

business

activities may have on the

environment, despite our best

efforts 

to 

minimise 

the

effects. However, despite the

downside of using coal, coal

will likely continue to be the

most affordable and readily

available source of energy for

decades to come, and that, is

critical for the growth and

improvements in standards of

living for developing nations.

 

Managing 

the 

effects 

of

climate change is a priority in

BlackGold’s 

environmental

management 

strategy, 

the

combustion of coal at the PT

SB concession produces GHG

and other emissions such as

dust 

that 

may 

have 

an

adverse 

impact 

on 

the

environment 

and 

the 

local

communities. At BlackGold,

we are constantly exploring

the 

use 

of 

different

technologies in our approach

to creating a clean and safe

working environment for our

employees, 

the 

local

communities, as well as the

biodiversity in the area.

 

Our open-pit mining activities

emit dust during excavation

and transportation. As part of

the 

Group’s 

environmental

management 

strategy, 

we

have employed extensive use

of 

dust 

suppression

techniques 

to 

control 

the

emanation of mining dust at

the mine site. 



Catalytic converters are also installed in all heavy equipment

used at the mine site to reduce the toxicity of gases released

into the atmosphere.

 

Prior to the release of this report, the Group has approached

2 separate third-party environmental consultants in relation

to the monitoring and management of GHG Emissions. The

Group is currently in the process of assessing and vetting the

third-party environmental consultants to come to a consensus

on which agency would be the best fit for managing such a

key material factor.

 

As of FY2019, the Group has yet to implement any systems

to measure the volume of GHG emitted, largely due to the

high costs involved that makes a measurement system

impracticable to be installed in the Company’s current stage

of growth. 

 

Moving into FY2020, the Group targets to engage a third-

party environmental consultants for the purpose of collecting

and analysing data on PT SB concession’s GHG Emissions.

It is our strong belief that long-term success is dependent on the strength and depth of our talent

pool and therefore, BlackGold is committed to growing and developing our human resources. We

believe in the importance of creating and maintaining a work culture that not only improves job

satisfaction but also encourages employee retention and instils motivation in our people. 

 

The Group believes that it is in our best interest to invest in the career of our employees through

continuous learning. We do this by providing ample on-the-job training for employees as and

when needed, as well as exposing them to development opportunities where they can get to

undertake challenging projects or assignments. We have also sent our employees to attend

relevant courses relating to the business. BlackGold places a strong emphasis on providing safe

working conditions, recognising and awarding outstanding performances, fostering team work

and offering rewarding career growth.

 

BlackGold continuously strives to improve the performance of its people as the primary asset in

running the Company’s business. We believe that our approach to employee-employer

relationships helps attract, motivate and retain our talent.

 

We are committed to promoting diversity in our workforce – inspiring creativity in our business

considerations and execution. BlackGold is an equal opportunity employer, employing and

promoting people purely based on merit.

 

Our employees are hired on the basis of their overall qualification for the required job; we do not

discriminate based on race, nationality, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, gender identity,

disability, and political (or other) opinions. The majority of BlackGold’s employees are male,

owing to the nature of our mining activities which naturally attracts more male workers. It is not

indicative of gender discrimination at the workplace.

 

At BlackGold, our remuneration structures are fair and merit-based according to a person’s

knowledge, experience and ability. We ensure a fair system across all eligible employees by

conducting an annual performance evaluation, during which we discuss an employee’s strengths

and areas for career development. The Group’s Remuneration Committee also reviews existing

remuneration structures on an annual basis to ensure that the structure is fair and appropriate in

accordance with updated regulations. 

 

BlackGold ensures that all permanent employees are covered under a fair compensation and

remuneration scheme comprising of basic salary, annual incentive, medical reimburse and job-

specific allowances, without prejudice. 

 

The Group invests in its employees through various professional development opportunities and

training programmes for mining supervisors to develop their skillset and equip them with the

necessary knowledge for further career advancement. In addition to professional training

programmes, knowledge sharing sessions are held regularly. These sessions see each employee

conduct a short lesson in their field of expertise to share their knowledge and experience with the

team. This fosters a holistic education to each team member’s contribution to the work place and

has proven to be an effective tool in developing a cohesive work environment.

Comprehensive Health Check-ups – conducted annually for all workers;

Emergency Preparedness Plan – a comprehensive plan to guide our workers and

sub-contractors on how to react during emergencies or accidents; 

Safety Risk Management – a guide on how to control and minimise risks in situations

that pose a safety hazard to our employees;

Safety, Health, and Environment Feedback Channels – there are prescribed

procedures in place for employees to address their concerns to the Management.

Our mining operations involve using large, heavy equipment. If not managed properly,

such equipments may affect the safety of employees at the mine site. Mining activities

also entail other risks such as unforeseeable emergency situations due to mine

accidents and natural disasters. That is precisely why the implementation of sound, well-

structured health and safety systems and emergency response protocols is critical to our

accident and disaster mitigation efforts. 

 

BlackGold regards health and safety as a critical and integral part of its operations. We

believe that the health and safety of our employees are essential for the sustainable

growth of the Group. Promoting a healthy and safe workplace has always been our

highest priority, and we remain committed to working towards the goal of zero-work

related accidents.

 

We demonstrate our commitment to maintaining this high standard by diligently

improving the health and safety practices described in its Health, Safety and

Environmental (“HSE”) Management System.

 

The principal aspects of BlackGold’s HSE Management System include:

 

At BlackGold, health check-ups are conducted annually for all workers as we believe in

taking care of our employees beyond their safety at the workplace. Our mining

concession is located in an area which is a distance from the city centre, as such,

medical resources are limited at the mining concession. Therefore, it is of utmost

importance to us to ensure the health aspects of our employees and their family

members are taken care of as a form of social responsibility towards the local

communities which we operate near to.

 

To instill a strong safety culture in our operation, we conduct mandatory daily safety

talks for our employees and contractor at our mining site. The regular safety talks

discuss various safety topics such as the importance of proper Personal Protective

Equipment (“PPE”) usage, identification of unsafe conditions, as well as the provisions

of safe and healthy working conditions and activities. This initiative is mostly targeting

our employees and contractor in our mining site due to the higher risk their work

possessed, as compared to our employees in the office. Through the implementation of

this program, the management aims to promote safe work practices among our workers

and to manifest the goal of zero work-related accidents in our operations.

 

During FY2019, no injuries or fatalities have occurred through the course of our mining

operations; and in line with our commitment to maintain a zero injuries and fatalities

record, we have procured additional enhanced safety equipment for our employees at

the mine site. Moving into the future, as the production volume increases, we shall also

step up on our efforts to maintain a safe and healthy environment for our employees to

work in.

Village development

While profitability is important, BlackGold believes in maintaining a balance between pursuing

both financial and corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) objectives. Our success is dependent

on our ability to maintain the trust and relationships with the communities at our concession,

and we foster these relationships through various sponsored activities and programmes to help

enhance their standards of living. 

 

The local community is viewed as an integral part of the Group’s operations. As part of the

Group’s CSR efforts, priority is given to local people in our recruitment as we believe in

empowering, developing and supporting the local talent present in the relevant countries in

which we operate. We believe that community empowerment is not only benefitting the local

society but also advancing the Group’s business through various support from the communities

to our operations. 

 

The Group also supports local business owners by procuring our food supplies directly from

them, and we sponsor the training of workers at the local community health centres so they

can in turn provide better health services to the community.

 

In FY2019 we carried out various CSR activities relating to the following area:

 

In addition to the the monthly financial and non-financial assistance that we provide to the local

communities neighboring our mining concession, BlackGold also sponsors certain special

annual events. During special occasions such as Ramadhan, Eid Al-Adha, Hari Raya Idul Fitri,

Lebaran Haji, and Christmas, the Group sponsored meals for the community and supported the

villagers with their celebrations financially.

LOCAL COMMUNITIES


Our PT SB concession is located in a remote and relatively underdeveloped area, where

amenities and infrastructure are less adequate as compared to the city centres. As such, we

take it upon ourselves to improve the lives of the community through formal employment,

infrastructure investments, healthcare, and education. 

 

Education is also one of our key focuses when it comes to helping local communities. We

believe that the only sustainable way to help improve the standards of living for the villagers

and their future generations is through providing opportunities for education for keen and

motivated learners, regardless of their age and proven abilities.

 

As our mining operations are based on the open pit mining method, BlackGold ensures that

we have a well-planned and strategic approach to the local communities settled in the

mining operational areas. If needed, the residents will be relocated from the designated

operating areas and the necessary assistance will be provided for the continuance and

betterment of their livelihoods. During FY2019, no relocation was required.

LOCAL COMMUNITIES


The BlackGold Group is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and

supports the principles of transparency, integrity and accountability advocated by SGX-

ST. The Board of Directors of the Group recognises the importance of corporate

governance and is committed to maintaining high standards to safeguard the interests of

the Company’s shareholders and enhance corporate value and accountability by

required to provide investors with an accurate, coherent and balanced account of the

Group’s performance.

primary function is to provide investors with timely and accurate disclosures as well as

develop investor engagement initiatives. Those include one-on-one meetings with

potential investors, investor roadshows as well as the regular updates of the investor

relations section of the corporate website. 

 

The Group, through the course of its business activities and engagement with local

suppliers and partners, is exposed to a relatively high degree of risk for corruption.

Therefore, we have made it our top priority to identify areas where corruption could occur

and put in place policies and practices to prevent it.

 

We manage this risk by maintaining our commitment to uphold the highest standards of

ethical behaviour and communicating to all employees that the Group has a zero-

tolerance attitude to all forms of unethical practices.

 

Employees who suspect or are aware of an occurrence of unethical behaviour are

strongly encouraged to report to the Management immediately as part of our

whistleblowing policy.

 

The Group maintains its resolve to continue upholding stringent standards towards

corruption and unethical behaviour. In FY2019, there were no unethical behaviour or

offences uncovered, and we target to report the same for FY2020

 

Moving forward, into and beyond FY2020, the Group shall step up on its efforts to

identify risks within its organisation in order to address them in a timely, and well-

organised manner.
