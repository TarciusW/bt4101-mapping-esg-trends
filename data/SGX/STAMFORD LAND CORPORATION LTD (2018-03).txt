Board Statement  

Dear Stakeholders,  

The Board is pleased to present our inaugural sustainability report. This report outlines our strategic 

commitment to grow and fulfil our responsibility to the communities we operate in and the environment.  

At Stamford Land Corporation (“SLC”), we recognise the importance of creating a sustainable business 

model and, in line with the evolving business landscape, have considered the environmental, social and 

governance (“ESG”) aspects in how we conduct business to thrive in the long run. This will enable us 

to deliver our services to the highest standards in responsible and sustainable ways.  

In accordance with the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited’s (“SGX-ST”) introduction of 

sustainability reporting for all Singapore-listed companies, our report covers how sustainability issues 

have been considered in the formulation of the Group’s strategy with reference to the Global Reporting 

Initiative (GRI) Standards (2016).  

Based on a materiality assessment conducted in 2018, the management has identified ten ESG factors 

that are material to the Group’s operations and they are namely: Energy Consumption and Associated 

Green House Gas Emissions, Waste Management, Water Management, Occupation Health and Safety, 

Economic Performance, Anti-Corruption, Employee Wellbeing and Engagement, Employee Training 

and Career Development, Local Community Investment and Development, and Data Security and 

Customer Privacy. 

These factors have been endorsed by the Board, who, supported by the Sustainability Steering 

Committee comprising of the Group’s management, oversee and manage sustainability-related risks 

and opportunities in these areas as well as our performance and targets moving forward.  

In FY2018, in recognition of our high service standards, our hotels were awarded numerous hotel and 

tourism awards. This reflects positively on our employees, who are given opportunities for personal 

growth and development in accordance with the Group’s objectives.  

We believe that the Group’s performance lies beyond simply financial performance. While we strive to 

increase productivity and maximise shareholder return, we also seek to create greater long-term value 

for all stakeholders.

Our Sustainability Approach 

Sustainability Governance Structure 

 

To facilitate and drive our sustainability efforts, SLC is proud to present our sustainability committee, 

which will be accountable to the Board of Directors for the sustainability strategy and performance of 

our business. This permanent committee will focus on the integration of social and environmental 

aspects of our business, and champion CSR efforts within the Group. In our inaugural year of reporting, 

we have set objective-based targets as we assess and progress on the Company’s sustainability efforts 

in the coming years.

SLC’s policies and processes were developed with the assistance of independent consultants, with 

extensive feedback from our employees and in consultation with our management team. SLC has an 

extensive range of policies which provide direction and instruction to our employees on a wide range of 

topics, including specific day-to-day operational matters such as incidents involving local enforcement 

agencies, to guest check-in and check-out procedures and late departures. We are constantly reviewing 

and improving on our policies, especially where they relate to material matters.

Creating Stakeholder Value 

Economic Performance 

SLC views our Economic Performance as one of our fundamental material matters. It is important that we 

provide long-term sustainable economic growth for the business and our stakeholders. As a group, we aim 

to achieve each hotel’s respective annual target revenue and profit set as well as to invest in appropriate 

capital expenditure to drive organic growth for our hospitality business segment. 

Examples of our individual hotel’s targets and group policies that enhance our financial performance are 

set out below. 

 

Our management team takes a practical approach towards financial management. We identify and mitigate 

risks, undergo internal and external audit for our financial accounts, and continually review our performance 

against internal benchmarks.  

Due to a focus on improving operating efficiencies, SLC’s hotel owning and management segment achieved 

total revenue of S$183.6 million in FY2018, a positive increase from S$178.8 million in FY2017. Basic 

earnings per share for SLC increased correspondingly to S$0.065 in FY2018 from S$0.040 in FY2017. 

Further details of SLC’s financial performance can be found under Financial Highlights (pages 18 to 19) 

and Financial Statements (pages 51 to 120) sections of the FY2018 Annual Report. 

 

The Financial Controllers Checklist Policy was implemented 

to serve as a check and balance to ensure that the respective 

financial controllers regularly check all reports, journals, 

transactions, balance sheet accounts and reports. This enhances 

the accuracy and reliability of the end reporting that is then 

reviewed by management. Our financial controllers make use of 

this check list to highlight areas of concern to be addressed from 

financial and legal perspectives to ensure full transparency with 

the owners and stakeholders. 

 

The Contracts for the supply and goods with Stamford 

Hotels and Resorts Policy was introduced to provide a clear 

and direct approval process for the negotiation and approval of 

all contracted goods and services. This ensures that our ongoing 

services maintain competitive pricing to maximise our group’s 

purchasing power. It also serves as a platform for the Company 

to work towards reducing costs and properly evaluate our 

performance from the initial stage of contractual negotiations.

Environmental Sustainability 

Energy Consumption and Water Management 

SLC is dedicated to reducing our environmental footprint as part of our efforts to address our stakeholders’ 

increasing focus on environmentally sustainable businesses. This demonstrates our commitment to 

minimise our impact on the environment while maintaining, and even increasing, our operational 

efficiencies, and do our part to preserve our planet for future generations to come.  

Examples of SLC’s environmental initiatives include:  

 

We are proud that SSCQ has been recognised as one of Trip Advisor’s “Green Leaders’ – Gold Status 

hotels. In SSCQ, all of our guest rooms are equipped with electrical appliances that have achieved the 10 

Star Energy Rating Label, the highest energy efficiency rating for appliances awarded under the E3 

Program, regulated by the Australian government.  

In FY2018, through our environmental initiatives and policies tailored specially for our hotels, we have 

reduced our overall fuel consumption by 9.2% from 50.0 Tj in FY2017 to 45.4 Tj in FY2018 and electricity 

consumption by 13.6% from 23,324 Mwh in FY2017 to 20,397 Mwh in FY2018. Our fuel sources comprise 

of natural gas, ethane, gas coke, gas oil and wood waste (renewable). Similarly, SLC, as a group, reduced 

its combined water consumption from 272,970 m³ in FY2017 to 270,668m³ in FY2018. SLC draws its water 

mainly from municipal water supplies, with a small portion from rainwater used for landscape irrigation by 

SPSA.

size and operations within our Group

•We maintain our equipment up to date and in good operating conditions at all times to 

achieve highest possible energy efficiencies

Waste Management 

The hospitality industry tends to generate large amounts of waste. As part of our efforts to address our 

environmental responsibility and the increasingly expensive costs of waste disposal, SLC has embarked 

on the development of an effective waste management system, starting with our proper waste disposal 

policy on top of our commitment to minimise waste generation across all hotels. 

Our hotels are required to segregate general waste and to ensure all housekeeping duties are performed 

in an environmentally friendly manner, including recycling and waste disposal. The use of chemicals, 

electrical heating and cooling systems are discouraged. We also engage environmentally responsible 

service providers in managing the disposal of our waste.  

Non-hazardous waste consists of mainly general waste, plastic waste, wood and cardboard waste, as well 

as food waste. Hazardous waste typically comprises trade waste, cooking oil and grease, most of which 

are disposed by licensed third party service providers. Approximately 63% of our hazardous waste and 

32% of our non-hazardous waste were recycled in both FY2017 and FY2018.

Case Study: SLC’s Waste Recycling Initiative 

 

As part of our efforts to eliminate excess waste, our hotels endeavour to promote best practices in the management 

of waste disposal. Spearheaded by the respective hotel Purchasing and Stewarding Teams, we collect cardboard 

and paper provided by our suppliers or service providers, or such materials used in events hosted at our hotels, 

and send them to recycling facilities or re-use them, where possible.  

Our teams are also responsible for collecting all used edible oils from the kitchens for recycling into biodiesel 

through the extraction process set out below.

Our People 

Employee Profile 

At SLC, we believe that human capital is key for long-term success in the hospitality industry and we 

embrace employees from all walks of life. Our permanent employee headcount for the respective 

jurisdictions we operate in are as follows: 611 in Australia, 169 in New Zealand and 38 in Singapore for 

FY2017. In FY2018, the number of permanent contract employees are 581, 169 and 39 respectively across 

our operations. Likewise, for temporary employee, our headcount for the respective jurisdictions are as 

follows: 316 in Australia and 1 in Singapore for FY2017, 313 in Australia and 8 in New Zealand in FY2018. 

 

Training and Career Development 

Given the service-driven nature of the hospitality industry, we understand that our business is only as 

successful as each of our employees. As such, we place a heavy emphasis on the continual development 

of reliable and skilled employees. This focus is reflected in our company mission and values.  

We have developed human resource policies that promote planned and comprehensive training for all 

employees so that they can meet and exceed performance standards. SLC also encourages its employees 

to take ownership of their skills development and learning. We set aside a fund for our employees to attend 

courses and seminars to improve their personal and work skills. Our employees also undergo regular 

performance feedback and guidance during the course of their employment to allow their supervisors to 

highlight areas for improvement and to commend employees where they have excelled.  

During the year, approximately 90% of the workforce attended training sessions and our permanent 

employees received at least 60 service training hours per employee, including on-site and vocational 

training.

Employee Wellbeing and Engagement 

In addition to having a skilled work force, SLC believes that our employees must be healthy and happily 

engaged at work for them to maximise their potential and productivity. Our employees enjoy a 

comprehensive work benefits package which includes parental leave, vaccination drives, health screenings, 

medical insurance coverage and employee discounts across our hotels. 

Our hotels also publish internal bi-monthly employee newsletters that report on hotel-led initiatives and 

activities for our employees and guests. Such activities include staff trips, team-bonding activities or charity 

drives. We encourage our staff to actively participate in such activities. Other than our annual performance 

appraisal, employees complete regular engagement surveys to ensure that any concerns are raised to and 

addressed by the appropriate channels. 

100% of our full-time employees that have served a full year participated in at least one performance or 

work appraisal during FY2018. In addition, the permanent employee turnover rate at our Australian hotels 

was approximately 28% in FY2018.  

Occupational Health and Safety 

SLC recognises that our ability to achieve our objectives depends on the wellbeing of our employees. We 

acknowledge that the key elements of workplace wellness include the physical and cultural environments 

as well as the policies, practices and procedures that guide our work. At the same time, it is our 

responsibility to maintain a safe and comfortable environment for our guests to feel at home away from 

home. 

At the forefront of safety protection is emergency preparedness. Taking a preventive approach, we strive 

to anticipate and mitigate any possible emergencies at our operational sites. To that end, SLC has 

partnered with an accredited emergency training provider to train all employees on state, federal and hotel 

emergency procedures, so as to equip our employees with the ability to react to different emergency 

situations effectively. Regular fire evacuations and emergency audits are also enforced across our hotels 

to promote familiarity of the steps to take, in the event of such emergencies. 

In addition, we have engaged a consultancy company to enhance our food safety practices. These practices 

are regularly reviewed, employees often undergo food safety training and all hotels actively participate in 

internal audits. We also conduct after action reviews to ensure that the appropriate steps are taken to 

improve upon our safety practices.  

At SLC, our policies and procedures governing occupational health and safety fully comply with all relevant 

codes, legislation and regulations. Further, we strive to maintain our clean record of zero occupational-

related injuries, diseases and fatalities as well as a reduction in employees’ absentee rate in the next twelve 

months. 

Our employees have reported no significant work-related injuries, occupational diseases or fatalities for 

FY2018. We have also not had any incidents of non-compliance with health and safety regulations or any 

major safety incidents across our portfolio. In tracking our employees’ wellness and health, our absentee 

rate at our Australian hotels1 has also shown a positive reduction from 1.57% in FY2017 to 1.32% in 

FY2018. Correspondingly, this decline in absenteeism was also generally experienced in both our male 

(FY2017: 1.37%, FY2018: 1.32%) and female (FY2017: 1.81%, FY2018: 1.33%) employees.

Local Communities 

Community Investment and Development 

Community investment and development allows SLC to establish a presence and contribute back to the 

respective communities where our properties operate. It is a great way to enhance our business reputation, 

boost visibility and brand awareness as well as build customer loyalty. It enables the Company to be 

recognised as an employer and business of choice. 

Our commitment to community development features in all respects of our decision-making processes; 

from our choice of products, range of services, to our associates, partners and vendors. We contribute to 

building the local economy by supporting local producers and showcasing their local produce. 

Our staff at our various hotels are encouraged to participate to good causes such as: 

• 

Our hotels in Adelaide participate in the “Soap Aid” initiative, where discarded soap is collected and re-

processed into fresh soap bars for distribution to targeted communities around the world.  

 

 

 

• 

Our Sydney hotels make a concentrated effort to source fresh local produce from local suppliers. Over 

90% of the wine list are sourced from Australia, of which approximately 60% of them are sourced 

directly from New South Wales.  

 

• 

All of our hotels also take part in local community charity drives and movements, including: donating 

portion of proceeds from ticket-purchases for the 2017 Melbourne Cup, hosting high teas and lucky 

draws at the hotel, volunteering at local community shelters and homes, donation drives where food 

items and clothing are donated to the Salvation Army.  

 

• 

Guests are also encouraged to donate to hotel nominated charity causes by electing to add a nominal 

donation to the charity to their hotel account either online or during check-in.

Our Customers 

Data Security and Customer Privacy 

Our hotels receive our guests’ personal information on a daily basis. As such, it is important for us to protect 

such vital information that has been entrusted to us. The manner we handle and respect our guests’ 

personal data is a facet of the suite of services we provide to our guests and we take great pride in ensuring 

that such private information is kept secure and safe.  

SLC’s data security and customer privacy policies and procedures clearly define the scope of personal and 

general information to our employees, in accordance with prevailing laws and regulations. We provide full 

disclosure to our guests as to when and how we collect and handle their personal data and the purposes 

for which such data is collected. The company has also appointed data protection officers, both at corporate 

and hotel levels, to respond to and address any queries that the public or guests may have regarding the 

collection and management of their personal data.  

We are proud to announce that in FY2018, we have not received any complaints or suffered any breaches 

of our guests’ personal data. We aim to maintain this record in the upcoming year. 

 

Governance 

Anti-Corruption 

Aside from the legal implications, corruption brings about many negative effects, the primary being the loss 

of trust with our stakeholders when corruption occurs. As a business, SLC has a strict zero tolerance policy 

when it comes to all form of corrupt activities, including and not limited to bribery and embezzlement.  

We have in place policies, checks and balances, and practices to ensure that our hotels are fully compliant 

with the prevailing laws and regulations relating to anti-corruption. The Company also has in place a whistle-

blower policy which allows stakeholders to raise concerns about possible improprieties which may 

adversely affect our operations via post to our whistle-blower panel or by email to our designated whistle-

blower officer. As part of their orientation, our employees are given anti-corruption training and 

familiarisation with the practices the Company has in place to prevent corruption. In FY2018, we have no 

reported instances of corrupt activities across our business. Likewise, we seek to maintain our good track 

record of zero corruption incidents in the upcoming year.
