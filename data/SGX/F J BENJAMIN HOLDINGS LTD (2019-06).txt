BOARD STATEMENT
F J Benjamin Holdings Ltd ("F J Benjamin" or "the Group") is proud to present our second
Sustainability Report. This report illustrates our sustainability performance for the financial year
ending 30 June 2019. The Group believes that sustainability plays a central role towards the
long-term sustainability of our business and the value we generate. The Board remains vigilant
in managing our Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") commitments together with
senior management. Together, we drive the Group's overall growth and development in a
sustainable manner.
The ESG matters that we have determined last year, namely, corporate governance, talent
management and development, and energy use and greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions
continue to be of importance to the Group's strategic objectives in today's increasingly
dynamic business environment.
We remain grateful to all Stakeholders who have supported the Group over the years. We look
forward to your continued support in building a sustainable future for generations to come

Omnichannel marketing: Superdry website
In our previous Sustainability Report, we have acknowledged the need for the Group to
embrace technology to engage customers across all touchpoints. Since then, we have
set up an Omnichannel Advisory Board in March 2018 to guide the Group in presenting
to customers an immersive and seamless experience that integrates physical stores with
online channels.
An example of this strategy can be observed in F J Benjamin's management of 'Superdry
local website. Through a quick search online, potential customers can view, purchase and
look up information regarding the range of products offered by the brand 'Superdry'. From
this portal, customers are also able to subscribe to the brand's newsletter and be kept
updated with information about their favorite brand. The increased engagement with our
customers through this platform has been highly successful in creating and maintaining
interest in Superdry products. Moving forward, the Group will implement a new CRM
(Customer Relationship Management) software to further enhance our digital marketing
program.

OUR GOVERNANCE
The Board strives to enhance shareholder value by upholding high standards of
corporate governance, integrity and accountability at all levels, underpinned by
robust internal controls in monitoring compliance matters, code of ethics and risk
management system.
Responsibility for Sustainability Governance
In FY2018, F J Benjamin formalised its sustainability reporting structure through the formation
of the Sustainability Reporting Team. Presiding over this team is The Board who is responsible
for overseeing and setting the direction for the business and its long-term sustainability. The
Board is supported by the Chief Operating Officer ("COO"), the respective Head of Departments
("HODs") and Sustainability Reporting Team personnel from various departments.

Ethics and Integrity
Approach
F J Benjamin's Corporate Code of Ethics serves to reinforce its values (Figure 6) and instill in its
culture, the duties and obligations ("Code of Conduct") of its employees within the organisation.
This has brought the company success over years, to its valued shareholders, principals, business
partners and its customers.
Overseen and monitored by F J Benjamin's Regional Compliance and Internal Audit department
it is also regarded as the personal responsibility of every employee and director to understand
and comply with the Code of Conduct that is made available to all new employees during
employee induction. F J Benjamin maintains a zero tolerance towards any violation of the Code
of Conduct. Any wrongdoings may result in disciplinary actions, which include reporting of matter
to appropriate authorities in cases of suspected corruption or any forms of criminal act.
All stakeholders can also direct any matters pertaining to possible improprieties in financial
reporting or other matters with guidance from our whistle-blowing policy which details examples
of reportable incidents and reporting procedures, as well as, the investigation and feedback
process thereafter.

the best talent.
The Group ensures that relevant staff are constantly kept up to date on new regulatory
requirements. Staff are provided opportunities to attend training and workshops to gain a better
grasp of the compliance requirements. In addition, F J Benjamin works closely with accredited
external auditors and its legal advisors to ensure that all regulatory requirements with SGX-ST
listing rules and the various International Financial Reporting Standards are adhered to

Talent Management and Development
Approach
F J Benjamin growth is sustained by the people who work tirelessly to keep operations running
smoothly, to bring latest products to the store and the delivery of valued service to our customers.
We have summarised our key initiatives taken, at every step of our employees' career, to ensure
that they are given the necessary resources to reach their fullest potential professionally in Figure
11 below.
14

One area where we have invested a significant amount of efforts in is the management of our
talent, in particular, the recruitment of our front-line staff who are key contributors to the sales of
products. Aside from the usual advertising channels for positions and recruitment of talent online,
F J Benjamin proactively scouts for them on the ground.
Further to that, when potential candidates reach out to us, the Human Resources ("HR") team
will first conduct an initial screening through phone interviews. Face to face interviews with the
shortlisted candidates are then subsequently carried out by hiring managers to determine their
suitability for the brand. Our rigorous system of recruitment is established so as to ensure that we
develop the right talent pool for effective sales of products for our brands.

Training opportunities at F J Benjamin
Superdry Fashion showas part of Brand Training Programme forFrontline Employees
To betterserve ourcustomers and improvethe brand knowledge of ourfrontlineemployees,
F J Benjamin often works with brand owners to conduct training for our employees. An
example of this is the training that was carried out by F J Benjamin's Superdry team. Our
Superdry teams from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia attended a training session held
at its Singapore VivoCity store during the launch period of its new Spring/ Summer 2019
collection.
Spearheaded by F J Benjamin's Superdry team, the training session involved an introduction
of the collection and in-depth explanation on the products' specifications. Paired with games
and a fashion show, our employees remain engaged throughout the training session.
The photos below highlight key moments of the training that was conducted for the new
launch earlier this year.
Supporting the Personal Development of Backend Employees
At F J Benjamin, we seek to give our employees the flexibility to adopt a bottom-up
approach in understanding how their interests in varied courses can help upgrade their
skills in both professional and personal depths, as well as, be applied to their jobs. In
recognition of such efforts taken by our employees, we have implemented a new initiative
which allows for backend employees to apply for course examination leave upon provision
of documentation that reflects their participation.
This is a considerable improvement in comparison to our previous system which only
granted examination leave for courses arranged solely by F J Benjamin for the selected
employees.

OUR ENVRONMENT
With intensifying call to change for concerted actions across the globe against
climate change, at F J Benjamin, we stand together by doing our part in ways we
best can in our gradual journey towards environmental stewardship.
Energy Emission and GHG Emissions
Approach
F J Benjamin continues to recognise the importance of managing our operational energy use. We
understand that our actions have a direct impact towards environmental issues such as climate
change. As such, we take all feasible steps to ensure that energy is not wasted in the course of
our business.
At F J Benjamin, our primary environmental footprint stems from electricity used from lighting
and air-conditioning to run our retail stores, warehouses and offices. In addition to updating
our infrastructure, we recognise the importance of inculcating an environmentally-conscious
attitude in our employees. Consequently, F J Benjamin has implemented several initiatives -
switching off office lights during lunch period and when not in use after office hours, placing
reminders in our stores to remind our employees to be more mindful about wasting energy and
harnessed technology at our offices to reduce frequency of travel - to reduce the energy use by
our employees.
Performance
In the last report, F J Benjamin set out to create a structured data collection process to track and
monitor the performance of our energy performance within offices, stores and warehouses in
which we operate. As of FY2019, we have completed this initiative.
In FY2019,the Group used a total 3,103,072 KWh of energy which produced 2,001,201 Kg CO2
in scope 2 emissions. Moving forward, the Group will continue to monitor our energy use and
 implement the appropriate strategies to improve the performance of this metric.
