Statement from Our Board

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

The Board and Management are pleased to present Chuan Hup Holdings Limited (“Chuan Hup”, the “Company” or 

the “Group”)’s third Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 30 June 2020 (“FY2020”). This report provides 

an illustration of key policies and practices to address Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) opportunities 

and challenges faced by Chuan Hup. This report also provides an update on Chuan Hup’s ESG performance of key 

metrics that have been shared in previous sustainability reports.

In our annual report, we highlighted the exceptional difficulties that the Covid-19 pandemic has had on our 

businesses. While the economic impacts are severe, Covid-19 also has a profound impact on how businesses 

manage issues of sustainability as the pandemic has placed ESG issues at the forefront for many governments 

and business globally. This pandemic represents both opportunities and risk to the business. Adaptation is required 

to successfully navigate through challenging times. For Chuan Hup, the pandemic has affected the way in which 

we operate on a day to day basis. From the adoption of new technology and changes to working arrangements, 

efforts have been undertaken to ensure that the needs of all our stakeholders are addressed during the pandemic. 

In FY2020, the Board and Management reviewed our ESG factors in the context of their relevance to addressing key 

challenges posed by the pandemic. In its review, the Board and Management have determined that the ESG factors 

identified in our inaugural report are still relevant to Chuan Hup. In this year’s report, special emphasis is placed on 

the relevance of our response to the pandemic to these material matters. The Board will continue to closely monitor 

all developments of the pandemic as well as other developments that may affect the long term sustainability of 

Chuan Hup. We appreciate the support that our stakeholders have provided us in these challenging times.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020


About the Report

This is Chuan Hup’s third Sustainability Report, prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards 2016 – “Core” 

reporting requirements and referenced GRI 403 Standard: Occupational Health and Safety 2018. This report details our approach in managing 

material sustainability matters identified as part of the Group’s operations for the period of 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020 (“FY2020”) on an annual 

reporting cycle. Where applicable, one year of historical performance data has been included for comparative purposes.

The scope of this report covers the sustainability performance of Chuan Hup’s investment holding business, and performance relating to issues 

from Chuan Hup’s operations. As Chuan Hup itself is not an operating company, the report does not consider issues which may be relevant for 

investee companies at their local operations or subsidiaries.

While we have not sought external assurance for this report, we will work towards doing so as our reporting matures over time.  

We welcome feedback from all stakeholders on our Sustainability Report. For any queries or comments on this report,  

please contact corpsec_legal@chuanhup.com.sg.

Sustainability Approach at Chuan Hup

Having a systematic approach enables Chuan Hup to quickly and competently address key matters that may affect the sustainability of  

our business. At Chuan Hup, the Board of Directors provides the overall direction for Management for matters pertaining to ESG issues. 

Management is responsible for the day to day implementation of key ESG policies and practices within Chuan Hup’s operations. The Board 

and Management work in tandem with stakeholders to ensure that all relevant ESG matters are accounted for during the formulation of its 

business strategy.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

By focusing resources on the most critical matters of our business, Chuan Hup is able to ensure that it adequately addresses the  

sustainability concerns of our stakeholders. Chuan Hup conducted its first materiality assessment in 2018 and identified four material 

matters and one reporting matter as summarised in figure 2. In FY2020, Chuan Hup re-examined these matters and found that they were still  

relevant to Chuan Hup. Moving forward, Chuan Hup will continue to monitor these material matters to ensure that they remain relevant  

and material.

Our Governance

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, BUSINESS ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE TO LAWS

Chuan Hup is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and business conduct to safeguard the interests of its 

stakeholders. We understand that any non-compliance to applicable laws and regulations or breach of trust could cause disruptions 

to operations and result in serious financial and reputation loss. Chuan Hup has paid close attention to any regulatory changes that have 

occurred, especially in relation to the management of COVID-19, to ensure that we remain compliant to said guidelines. Chuan Hup’s Board of 

Directors is directly responsible for the implementation and management of policies and practices on corporate governance.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES

It is mandatory for all employees to adhere to Chuan Hup’s Corporate Governance policies and practices stated as summarised in  

Table 1 below.  To ensure compliance, all employees are required to submit an annual declaration of non-conflict of interest with the  

Company’s business.

Table 1. Summary of Chuan Hup’s Corporate Governance Policies

POLICIES/PRACTICES

DESCRIPTION

Policy on Work Ethics

All employees are expected to adhere to a high standard of personal conduct at all times and not to 

engage in any activities or interests that conflict with any of the Group’s business. This policy covers 

the following elements:

• General conduct

• Management of data and intellectual property

• Anti-corruption (Conflict of interests, prohibition, non-solicitation)

Whistleblowing Policy

The policy serves to encourage and provide a channel to employees of the Company and any 

other persons to report in good faith and in confidence, without fear of reprisals, concerns about 

possible wrongdoing, or breach of applicable laws, regulations, policies or other matters.

Internal Code on  

Dealing in Securities

Chuan Hup’s internal code on securities trading sets out the implications of insider trading 

and provides guidance and internal regulation on dealings in the Company’s securities by its 

Directors and employees.

Chuan Hup conducts internal and external audits regularly to review the Company policies and practices and reinforce our commitment. 

Feedback from all stakeholders during Annual General Meetings and Extraordinary General Meetings are communicated to Management to 

further enhance and improve the Company’s business operations. Also, to ensure alignment with all regulatory requirements, Directors and 

Senior Management have attended seminars on changes to the Code of Corporate Governance and SGX Listing Rules. 

More detailed corporate governance practices are set out in our Corporate Governance Report, found from pages 21 to 32 of Chuan Hup’s  

2020 Annual Report, with specific reference to the principles of the Code of Corporate Governance 2018.

CHUAN HUP HOLDINGS LIMITED


TARGET AND PERFORMANCE

We are pleased to report that in FY2020, there were no reported 

cases of corruption and non-compliance with environmental and  

socioeconomic laws and regulations.

INFORMATION SECURITY &amp; PRIVACY

As a consequence of the pandemic, most companies have been 

forced to explore alternative working arrangements including 

remote working. While remote working provides employees with 

flexibility and safety, it also comes with its own set of risks. In 

particular, managing risk arising from information security &amp; privacy 

becomes increasingly complex outside of the closed environment 

of the office. In light of this, Chuan Hup has enhanced several of its 

digital security protocols and infrastructure to manage this risk.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES

Chuan Hup adopts a three-pronged approach to address the 

issue of information security. In FY2020, these measures have 

been enhanced to better meet the challenges arising from new 

workplace arrangements. An overview of these enhancements has 

been summarised in Figure 4.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020


The first approach taken by Chuan Hup has been through the implementation of the latest technologies and data management  

best practices to secure our data. This includes the use of firewalls, anti-malware software, and password management policies  

that have been core to our data management infrastructure. This year, we have been focused on improving our data backup  

process, which has been affected by the changes to the work from home arrangements. This has been done through the implementation 

of a two-tier digital backup system – onsite with a Synology RS820 server as well as an offsite cloud-based server through a  

Microsoft Azure Cloud Subscription. Additionally, internal systems such as accounting, and HR systems have been upgraded to allow  

for better management of electronic documents.

Chuan Hup directly communicates with our staff to ensure that they comply with all the necessary best practices. This  

communication is done through the employee manual, Chuan Hup’s House Rules Policy, and email circulars. Employees were also  

informed on how to use Chuan Hup Virtual Private Network (VPN) whilst working from home. The use of a VPN is important as it ensure that 

only authorised individuals can access sensitive files in the server.

Finally, we constantly monitor for malicious activities within our server and conduct monthly server maintenance to ensure that the system 

is kept up to date against any new threats that may compromise our systems. We have also implemented new policies to ensure that data 

backup procedures occur regularly to prevent loss.

HEALTH AND SAFETY

The onset of the global pandemic has placed health and safety in the workplace as a central concern for all businesses. As an employer, we 

recognise that we have a responsibility to provide a safe and healthy environment for all our employees. Whether it is through implementing 

safe distancing measures in the office or facilitating staff to work from home, we have taken every step to ensure that our employees are 

protected from the risks of the virus.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES

In FY2020, we maintained our policies and practices concerning health and safety, focusing on three different aspects – workplace safety, 

employee health, and employee well-being – which has been summarised in figure 6. In response to the pandemic, Chuan Hup has introduced 

additional policies and practices, please see the section below for more details on our pandemic response.

Addressing the threat from COVID-19

Throughout the pandemic, we have taken cues directly from MOM’s advisories to implement measures to reduce the spread of the virus at 

the workplace. Chuan Hup has focused on three primary areas to manage this epidemic – effective communication, employee welfare, and 

digitalisation. These strategies have been summarised in figure 7.

Effective communication was a key part of our strategy to manage our pandemic response. Through a series of emails by HR and management, 

employees were kept abreast of new internal policies and safe workplace guidelines by the MOM. These helped to prevent any confusion that 

might have resulted in breaches to safe workplace guidelines by MOM. Additionally, employees were able to reach out to HR or their managers 

if they had any concerns or difficulties whilst they were working from home.

Chuan Hup also took the opportunity to enhance benefits provided to its employees during this period. In recognition of difficulties that 

employees may face adapting to the change in working conditions, we have provided employees with more flexibility in their working hours. 

Additionally, we provided all employees with laptops and IT equipment and provided monthly internet allowances to make the transition to 

working from home a smoother process. Upon returning to the office in Phase 2 reopening of Circuit Breaker, employees were provided with 

safety kits which had essential items such as face mask to allow them to safely work from the office.

Finally, Chuan Hup took the opportunity to digitalise several of its workplace procedures carried out by employees. This includes implementing 

payroll integration, online e-payment, e-invoice approval process, e-document management system and paperless approving process.

Figure 7. Summary of Chuan Hup’s COVID-19 response

EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION 

AND AWARENESS RAISING

With the rapid changes to regulations 

and workplace requirements by the 

authorities to manage the COVID-19 crisis, 

Chuan Hup ensured that employees 

were regularly updated through email. 

This includes communication on:

- General information on prevention 

spread of COVID-19 virus

- New measures to allow for  safe 

distancing (i.e. staggered work times, 

work from home arrangements, 

physical management of office space)

-  Workplace arrangements for phase 2

EMPLOYEE WELFARE

In recognition of the potential difficulties 

that employees may face while adapting 

to new workplace arrangement, 

Chuan Hup has implemented several 

measures to reduce disruption. 

These includes:

- Flexible working hours

- Flexible working arrangements

- Safety kit provided to all employees 

returning to the workplace in phase 2

- Sourcing of IT equipment to facilitate 

work from home arrangements

- Monthly work from home 

internet allowance

WORK-PLACE DIGITALISATION

 

COVID-19 has accelerated Chuan Hup’s 

uptake of new technologies to improve 

operational efficiency  

and resilience. 

These includes:

- Payroll integration

- Online e-payments

- Electronic-invoice approval process

- Electronic-document 

management system

- Paperless approving process

- Accounting and HR system enhancement

TALENT MANAGEMENT

Despite challenges posed by the pandemic, Chuan Hup has continued to place significant emphasis on developing and managing our talent. 

We believe that a competent workforce would be able to better seize new opportunities as the economy charts its path towards recovery. Chuan 

Hup is committed to hire, manage, develop, and retain talented and excellent employees in the Company. We take the effort to effectively 

manage employees to help them develop their skills and capabilities, helping to improve the Company’s business performance.  

POLICIES AND PRACTICES

Chuan Hup learning and development policy places emphasis on self-development – employees could explore specific skills that they want to 

develop and the Company would provide appropriate support. This allows employees the flexibility to explore areas that they find essential for 

their career developing including in topics such as accounting and IT. 

TARGETS AND PERFORMANCE

In FY2020, Chuan Hup employees at all levels participated in both training conducted internally as well as by external vendors. Examples of the 

training include information sessions about regulatory changes, market-specific seminars and training on the use of new digital software. As a 

result, Chuan Hup employees underwent 182 hours of training, a decrease from FY2019 (310 hours). This can be attributed to variations in hours 

required for new staff orientations, followed by suspension of physical seminar amidst COVID-19 pandemic.

The HR department conducts regular performance review for all employees. These reviews may come in the form of performance and career

should work on in subsequent reporting periods. In FY2020, 100% of our employees were provided with performance reviews.
