This Report has been prepared with a view towards 

complying with the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading

We are continuously looking at improving our reporting 

frameworks and methodologies, and will endeavour to 

provide more comprehensive disclosure in subsequent 

years as we continue to improve our sustainability practices. 

 

Message from the Board

Sustainable business practises are an important part of 

doing business responsibly. We recognize organisations 

have the capacity to add value to, and influence positively 

our colleagues, business partners, families, and the 

community at large through sustainable business practises. 

Being transparent about efforts in this area enables you, 

our stakeholders, to hold us responsible and accountable 

to our goals and commitments. 

We continually assess and refine our sustainability reporting 

framework and material ESG factors. For FY2018, we have 

assessed and identified new ESG factors relevant to the 

Group, in addition to those raised in the sustainability 

report accompanying the Company’s annual report for the 

financial year ended 31 December 2017. We hope you will

Economic performance

We are committed to provide a wealth of growth opportunities for our shareholders and stakeholders by pursuing 

sustainable business growth. 

We will continue to navigate forward and remain fully committed to build stronger global partnerships with existing 

and potential suppliers and customers, with a focus on our core electronic components distribution business. We are 

continuously reviewing our growth strategies with a view to enhancing our value proposition as a distribution intermediary 

between chipmakers and manufacturers of electronic end-products. As an established distributor with a proven track 

record, we expect to continue this trade for many more years and remain an integral part of the international supply 

chain for chipmakers, original equipment manufacturers and major electronic brands. Over the years, the Group has 

also diversified into the consumer products distribution and investment holding of high-margin companies to provide 

additional income streams for the Group with a view to enhancing shareholders’ value over the long term.

As a company listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited, we publish annual report comprising our 

corporate governance and financial performance. A summary of our economic performance is provided below, in line

Anti-corruption

At Serial System Ltd, we prohibit corruption in any form, including but not limiting to extortion and bribery. We require 

all employees, officers and directors to conduct business worldwide with integrity, transparency, and in compliance with 

applicable legal requirements relating to bribery, corruption, anti-money laundering and terrorism financing. This has 

been made clear to all employees, customers, suppliers and business partners. 

The Company has in placed a whistle-blowing policy which enables employee to report or raise concerns over any 

“wrongdoings” across the Group in relation to unlawful conduct, financial malpractice or dangers to the public or 

environment directly to the chairman of the Audit Committee, with the “whistle-blower” who has acted in good faith, 

being provided confidentially, victimisation and harassment protection. “Wrongdoings” can include fraud, corruption, 

theft, abuse of authority, breach of regulations or non-compliance with the Group’s internal controls and procedures. 

On an ongoing basis, the whistle-blowing policy is covered during employee training and periodic communication 

including e-mail sent quarterly to all employees as part of the Group’s efforts to promote awareness of anti-corruption 

and fraud prevention. Our goal is to maintain zero incident of corruption. We will regularly review policies on anti-

corruption to keep abreast of technological and business developments.   

There have been no reported incidents of corruption during the reporting year. 

ENVIRONMENT

Environment protection

We are engaged in electronic components and consumer products distribution. Other businesses of the Group comprise 

provision of hospitality and healthcare solutions, and assembling and distribution of medical devices. We impact the 

environment directly through the use of electricity in our offices and warehouses, the use of fuel in transportation for 

deliveries of inventories. Our direct environmental footprint is relatively small, but we can still do our part to mitigate 

climate change through monitoring, tracking and mindful utilisation of our resources.  

We manage our energy consumption by monitoring and reducing consumption. We plan to improve our electricity-

saving efforts through continuous education of employees and other internal stakeholders to increase awareness of 

environmental sustainability. We frequently encourage and remind our employees to turn off lights, electricity and air-

conditioning when they are not in use.

Energy consumption 

The Group started tracking its energy consumption from FY2018. Our energy data in the report includes purchased 

electricity. 

Based on available data, the Group consumed approximately 2,075,984 kWh of electricity. The findings are based on 

statements from utility providers in the territories that the Group operates in. 

Our offices in Singapore, Hong Kong and China accounted for 83% of the total electricity used.

Based on the electricity consumed by the Group, our energy intensity per employee was 7.8 GJ in FY2018. We will strive 

to maintain or reduce the energy intensity per employee at 7.8 GJ or below in 2019. 

Energy saving measures

To reduce our ecological footprint, we use energy-saving equipment in our offices and warehouses, and consolidate our 

shipments of inventories wherever possible. We are also moving towards digital transactions to reduce paper usage and 

to boost productivity. Besides doing our part for the environment, these efforts also yield cost savings for the Group.

Carbon Dioxide emissions from freight activities 

As a distributor, we impact our environment indirectly through the movement of inventories from suppliers to customers 

via air or sea freight. We are aware of the environmental footprint of such activities, and the need to be transparent, so 

that our stakeholders can hold us accountable to the goals we set.

It is our goal to strive to continually reduce our emissions of Carbon Dioxide (“CO2”) and play our part to alleviate the 

impact of global warming. We hope to realise this objective by: 

 

1.    Better consolidation of inventories to be transported 

2.    Reducing the use of air freight as air freight generally emits more CO2 per-kilometre than sea freight. 


SERIAL SYSTEM LTD I SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

5

CO2 emissions per Sales Dollar

In FY2018, for every dollar of sales, 0.48 gram of CO2 were emitted. Air freight was the main mode of transport for 

the Group in FY2018. As more CO2 is emitted by air for every kilometre travelled compared to sea freight, the Group 

believes its overall emission level can be reduced if it manages to ship more inventories by sea versus by air. 

CO2 emissions per Purchase Dollar

In FY2018, for every dollar of inventories purchased, 2.69 grams of CO2 were emitted. The Group aims to lower the CO2 

emissions per dollar of inventories purchased through improved consolidation and planning of shipments. 

CO2 emissions per Dollar Transacted

In FY2018, for every dollar transacted, 1.44 grams of CO2 were emitted. In the long run, the Group aims to lower the 

CO2 emissions per dollar transacted, especially through the optimization of inbound shipments.  

Environmental compliance 

We are committed to ensuring compliance with applicable environmental laws. There were no incidents of non-

compliance with environmental rules or regulations in the reporting year.

partners. 

We encourage our employees to continuously upgrade themselves professionally, and provide sponsorship for them 

should they express a desire to attend external courses or seminars. By empowering our staff with the right resources 

and looking after their well-being, we help them to be their best at work, grooming them to be our leaders of tomorrow.

forced or compulsory labour, as well as discrimination. We respect our employees’ right to freedom of association and 

collective bargaining. There were no reported incidents of child labour, forced or compulsory labour and discrimination 

in the reporting year. 

Employee engagement and turnover

higher business productivity and efficiency. The Group offers a range of benefits to employees, which vary by region 

and includes not limited to the following – parental leave, life insurance, healthcare, pension and severance benefits

provision. All employees receive yearly appraisal and various entities within the Group also hold regular team building and 

recreational activities, and staff bonding events to engage their staff and boost their morale to increase job satisfaction. 

We encourage open and clear communication and provide positive reinforcements based on merits. 

The high attrition rate of 42% in FY2018 is due to the active movement labour market some of the entities within the 

Group operate in. While job mobility is an inherent nature of the present-day labour market, we aim to reduce the 

attrition rate through process improvements and continued engagement with our employees as discussed above to 

further improve the stability, efficiency and effectiveness.

GOVERNANCE 

 

Customer privacy

Cyber security and data privacy are important not just for compliance. We also respect the privacy of our customers and 

suppliers and take necessary steps to safeguard both our data and that of our customers and suppliers. The Company 

takes measures to guard against cyber risks for both internal and external stakeholders by complying with the Personal 

Data Protection Act in Singapore. We have implemented a Personal Data Protection Policy which governs the collection,

Business ethics and compliance 

We believe that compliance with rules and regulations is a key part of running a responsible business. For this reason, 

the Group is committed to instil in all its employees to act ethically and responsibly at all times through regular open 

communications to all heads of department to emphasise the importance of integrity, fairness, value addition and 

transparency when doing business.     

The nature and scope of the Group’s distribution business also make us highly susceptible to being victims of international 

fraud and unlawful activities, especially where trade compliance is concerned. For this reason, the Group engages an 

International Trade Compliance (“ITC”) officer to ensure the Group complies with international trade laws and regulation 

and regularly update the management and key personnel on developments in international and local trade regulations.      

The ITC officer also leads the Group on all ISO Quality Accreditations initiatives. In FY2018, the Group’s various entities 

obtained the following Trade &amp; ISO Certifications:-

 

• Serial Microelectronics Pte Ltd – SG Customs TradeFIRST Premium Band dated 16 March 2018

• Serial Microelectronics Pte Ltd – SG Customs Secure Trade Partnership (STP) dated 16 March  2018

• Serial Microelectronics Korea Limited – South Korea Ministry of Trade, Industry &amp; Energy (MOTIE) Internal 

   Compliance Program (ICP) Accreditation dated 19 March 2018

• Serial Microelectronics Inc. – Taiwan Bureau Foreign Trade (BOFT) Internal Compliance Program (ICP)  

   Re-Certification dated 31 March 2018

• Serial Microelectronics (HK) Limited - ISO9001:2015 QMS dated 7 August 2018

• Serial Microelectronics Pte Ltd - ISO22301:2012 Business Continuity Management System (BCMS)

Owing to Serial Microelectronics Inc.’s strong commitment in trade compliance for strategic high-tech commodities, 

since 6 December 2016 (and re-certification on 31 Mar 2018), we had been accredited with Taiwan Bureau of Foreign 

Trade (BOFT) Certificate No. 1052850475 as the 53th organization in the entire Taiwan and awarded the prestigious 

membership into BOFT’s quarterly roundtable meetings organized by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan.       

Similarly, Serial Microelectronics Pte Ltd on 16 March 2018 had been awarded with the Best-In-Class TradeFIRST 

Accreditation and recognized as a “Secure Trade Partner” with Singapore Customs under the Secure Trade Partnership 

(STP) Program and granted a STP Certification Membership No. AEOSG12022018001T which is mutually recognized 

by World Customs Organization (WCO) matching the standards of Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) and U.S. CBP 

Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT). 

In 2018, Serial Microelectronics Pte Ltd had been listed in the Singapore Customs Website “Hall of Fame” together with 

97 companies in Singapore as Secure Trade Partnership (STP) Companies. The STP is a voluntary certification programme 

consistent with the World Customs Organisation (WCO) SAFE Framework of Standards to secure and facilitate global 

trade.  The programme encourages companies to adopt robust security measures using a risk-based approach in their 

trading operations to improve global supply chain security. By participating in the programme, a company demonstrates 

commitment and willingness in keeping the supply chain secure. 

Risk management

As part of the Group’s commitment to deliver sustainable value to stakeholders, the Group recognises the importance 

of identifying and addressing key risks. As the Group does not have a risk management committee, the Board, Audit 

Committee (“AC”), Internal Auditor and Management assume the responsibility of the risk management function. The 

Group has documented a framework on its risk profile which summarises the material risks faced by the Group and the 

counter-measures in place to manage or mitigate those risks which has been reviewed by the AC and the Board. The 

documentation provides an overview of the Group’s key risks, how they are managed, the key personnel responsible for 

each identified risk type and the various assurance mechanism in place. It allows the Group to address the changes and 

the challenges in the business environment, reduces uncertainties and facilitates the shareholder value creation process 

on an ongoing basis.

The Group’s approach to risk management is set out in our Annual Report 2018 under the following sections:

• Additional Requirements of Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited’s Listing Manual – Risk Management 

   section, page 180 - 181

• Corporate Governance Report – Risk Management and Internal Controls section, page 37 - 38  

 

The Group aims to review the risk management framework regularly to ensure all relevant risks are identified, 

communicated and addressed timely.
