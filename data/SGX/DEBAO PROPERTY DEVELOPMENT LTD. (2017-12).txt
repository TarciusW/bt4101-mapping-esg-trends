1. Highlights 

1.1 Corporate profile 

Established in 2000, Debao Property Development Ltd. (Debao or the 

‘Company’), together with its subsidiaries, (the ‘Group’) is an 

integrated property developer of quality integrated residential 

properties and commercial properties from Foshan City, Guangdong 

Province, the People’s Republic of China (PRC). 

Our vertically-integrated business model and operations enable us to 

carry out key aspects of property development, such as design, 

construction and marketing, in-house as well as manage the 

developments after completion. 

Led by our experienced management team, we have built a strong 

presence and brand name in developing large scale and multi-phased 

projects that are fully integrated with ancillary facilities. 

Our business comprises four segments: property development, 

construction contract, property investment and property management. 

The thirteenth completed property development project, Sihui Project 

Block B&amp;C with a gross floor area (GFA) of 97,000 m2 was officially 

handed over to buyers.  

As at 31 December 2017, the Group has a total GFA of approximately 

1.24 million m2 of properties under and held for future development, 

including three projects in Malaysia. As part of our property 

investment business, we hold selected commercial properties that we 

have developed or bought for capital appreciation for recurring and 

stable rental income. We also provide management services for 

residential properties developed by us. 

As testament of our quality operations and property developments, 

our Jiangnan Mingju Phases 1 to 4 won the Double Gold Prize 

(Construction and Environment) in the National Residential 

Construction, Planning and Design Competition (全国人居经典建筑规

划设计方案竞赛：建筑、环境双金奖) in October 2004. 

Apart from China development projects, the Group has been actively 

exploring and studying commercially viable new ventures and 

overseas development projects. 

Since 2012, the Group has extended its operations to Malaysia as 

part of its strategy towards globalisation and build an international 

brand name in property development. As at the date of this annual 

report, we have three projects in Malaysia, especially the Plaza 

Rakyat Project, located in central Kuala Lumpur, which when 

completed, will become the next most significant landmark of Kuala 

Lumpur after the Petronas Twin Towers. 

Debao was successfully listed on the Main Board of the Singapore 

Exchange Securities Trading Limited (SGX-ST) on 12 April 2010.

1.2 Message to stakeholders 

Debao has been committed to creating a sound living and 

working environment for our customers. This reflects not 

only our attitude to the environment and responsibilities 

for the society, but also our expectations for the future.  

In 2017, we continue to engage in constructive dialogue with our 

stakeholders and focus on our four key pillars of Green Development, 

Operational Safety, Environmental Sustainability and Employee 

Motivation. We will strive to continue having zero accident rates in all 

our current property development projects. 

During the year, we have continued to invest in international 

development while keeping an eye on our domestic properties. In 

particular, Project Imbi, located in the central business district of 

Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is having a smooth development progress 

and expecting to commence pre-sales in first quarter of 2019 after 

completion of its sales centre. With a total planned construction area 

of 194,000 m2, the project will greatly strengthen the ability of the 

Group to withstand the changes in China’s domestic policies. 

Adhering to the mindset and practice of “green and eco-friendly 

development”, we will continue to invest in integrated developments 

comprising both residential and commercial units. We believe that this 

encourages an active lifestyle amongst the residents, boosts work life 

balance, reduces vehicular fuel consumption, and enables people to 

enjoy a higher standard of living. 

We are aware that our carbon footprint arises primarily out of 

electricity consumption of our companies. As such, we will step up 

our efforts on improving the energy efficiency of our operations in the 

coming year, doing our part to contribute to the positive global action 

on climate change. 

In addition, we wish to confirm that the Board has considered 

sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation, determined 

the material environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and 

overseen the management and monitoring of the material ESG 

factors. 

As part of Debao’s commitment to sustainable development, we will 

continue to strive to do business in a responsible way. We will 

improve on our sustainability achievements and partner with other 

parties to create a green ecosphere as well as a natural and 

harmonious living environment.

2.3 Sustainability materiality 

We recognise the need to continuously develop our responsible business approach in order to address 

growing stakeholder expectations around our impact on the economy, environment and society. As such, we 

periodically consult with our stakeholders to determine the issues that are most relevant to them and Debao. 

Some of our stakeholder’s comments can be found in Appendix C. 

Using a materiality index, we align our responsible business priorities with the Debao’s principal business 

and operational risks, as illustrated in the diagram below. 

We have also developed metrics to help us measure our progress, as indicated in our sustainability 

scorecard in Appendix B. We will review and adjust the matrix each year, as the external and business 

context changes.

3. Our performance 

3.1 How we measure our performance 

Our sustainability strategy is embedded into the appropriate parts of our business, with dedicated teams 

for each focus area, and coordination by our relevant departmental managers. 

Progress will be tracked in two key ways: measuring performance against metrics, and evaluating how well 

the programs have advanced, through a series of ‘commitments’. 

Metrics and targets 

We have established key performance indicators for each of the four focus areas outlined in our 

sustainability strategy. As this is our first year adopting sustainability reporting, we will be establishing 

targets within the next year to hold ourselves accountable and track how we are doing. 

Periodically, we plan to introduce new metrics and update targets to ensure alignment with our strategy. 

Commitments 

To ensure we have a robust sustainability program in place, we will also publish the key initiatives we plan to 

implement within the next year.

3.2 Green development 

Overview 

Since 2000, Debao has been an integrated property 

developer of quality integrated residential properties and 

commercial properties in the PRC. In 2012, we further 

expanded our operations to Malaysia. 

We recognise that “green development” has become a 

common pursuit of our people, and we too, have started 

to integrate this aspect into our projects from 

commencement to completion. Our vertically integrated 

business model and operations allows us to embed green 

practices into key aspects of property development, from 

design, construction and marketing to managing the 

developments after completion. 

Comprehensive community development 

We adhere to the mindset and practice of “green and eco-friendly 

development” throughout the lifecycle of a project and advocate 

“green office” among the employees to economise on the resources, 

abate pollution and reduce CO2 emission to the greatest extent, so as 

to contribute more to a bluer sky and cleaner water. 

Over the years, we are involved in a number of integrated 

developments comprising both residential and commercial units, 

including Plaza Rakyat, Sihui Project, Jiangnan Mingju and Jin Long 

Garden. Most major amenities, shopping and entertainment are within 

walking distance. This encourages an active lifestyle amongst the 

residents, boosts work life balance, reduces vehicular fuel 

consumption, and enables people to enjoy a higher standard of living. 

In 2017, the Total GFA for all development properties of the Group 

(since 2000), comprising completed properties and properties under 

development, stands at 2.3 million m2. Please refer to the list our 

property developments to date (since 2000) in Appendix A.

Green construction 

We have extended the connotation of green properties, and followed 

the idea of environmental protection throughout the whole process of 

construction. Together with our partners, we have made in-depth 

research over a rational construction site layout, and continuously 

enhanced on-site management to create a clean, tidy, comfortable 

and safe construction environment. 

We have made explicit provisions over noise, exhaust gas, sewage 

and solid wastes generated in everyday life and production. We have 

also taken protective measures over soil and natural resources and 

minimised the influences of dusts and construction wastes on the 

communities and residents in strict compliance with national and 

municipal regulations. 

 

Noise management 

• Setting reasonable construction timetable 

according to the noise limits at different stages. 

• Vigorously promoting new noise-reduction and 

vibration-damping technologies to abate noise 

during pile foundation engineering, etc. 

• Taking proper measures to reduce the noises 

generated by mixers and other noisy machineries. 

 

Dust and airborne contaminants management 

• Sprinkling water to lay the dust during dust-

prone operations, loading/unloading and 

transportation. 

• Properly storing and covering any granular 

materials that are easy to ascend into the air; 

and cutting materials in the shed with proper 

dust-control measures. 

• Do not burn any substances that may produce 

harmful or poisonous gas, smoke or dust at the 

construction sites. 

 

Sewage management 

• Finishing the installation of drainage and 

sewage treatment facilities before the 

commencement of construction, to ensure up-to-

standard water discharge, no accumulated 

water on site, and no overflow or blockage 

during drainage. 

• Recycling processed construction sewage 

 

Construction waste management 

• Taking proper measure to minimise solid 

wastes, such as centralised mortar mixing and 

reduced use of bagged cements. 

• Disposing construction and domestic wastes in 

strict compliance with the government 

requirements

Energy saving design 

Project conceptualisation is carried out in the initial phase for property 

development. This may be carried out in-house by the Group, or 

outsourced to professional consultants, such as architects, interior 

designers, surveyors or engineers (mechanical, electrical, civil and 

structure). In our recent projects, we have incorporated energy saving 

designs into our building plans. We will also regularly invest in 

enhancing the environmental performance of our portfolio. 

To improve electrical efficiency, various energy saving practices have 

been implemented in the residential and commercial properties 

managed by the Group.  

For example, all air-conditioning units in the Plaza Rakyat project 

comply to the energy efficiency equivalent to 3-ticks of the BCA 

Greenmark. Hence, these units consume less electricity and are more 

environmentally-friendly. 

Going forward, we seek to align ourselves with international 

standards and best practices in green building design and 

construction by committing to obtain green building certification (e.g. 

LEED certification program) for our new properties.  

These green building certification programs will provide us with 

external assurance on the measures we have incorporated to 

improve the environmental performance of our buildings. We will 

continue to review our strategy in pursuing green building 

certifications to keep our competitive edge, and contribute to raising 

industry standards for green building design and construction over the 

long term. 

Responsible supply chain 

We have constantly improved the procurement management and 

bidding system, maintained good partnership with our suppliers and 

subcontractors, and further deepened strategic cooperation with 

outstanding partners for the sake of shared development under a 

rigorous supplier evaluation system, thus boosting the overall 

capacity of the supply chain. 

We have consistently followed the ideology of honest procurement 

and safeguarded the fundamental rights and interests of suppliers in 

a fair, just and open manner. 

In 2017, 72.5% of our purchases are sourced from local suppliers. 

We believe that a secure and stable local supply chain that meets our 

sustainability needs is very important to ensure the smooth and 

uninterrupted operation of our operating activities.

3.3 Operational safety 

Overview 

Safety is of paramount importance to us, and we have 

always stressed the importance of production safety in all 

our operations, especially when we deal with our building 

contractors. 

Managing building contractors 

Construction site safety is a top priority for the Group. Our major 

construction projects are located in China and Malaysia. We 

institutionalised our construction safety management with the 

following objectives: 

• 

To ensure contractor compliance with the relevant safety 

regulations; 

• 

To establish an effective communication platform that helps 

enhance the overall awareness of our staff and contractors of 

how to deal with safety concerns; 

• 

To build up the knowledge and capacity of site workers on 

how to carry out their work in a safe fashion; and 

• 

To minimise site injuries and to achieve zero fatalities. 

The Group has developed a comprehensive set of guidelines and 

operating procedures to enhance overall safety performance at our 

project sites. In particular, our Safety Management Policy and 

Equipment Management Policy clearly articulate our specific safety 

requirements and emergency protocols for different work tasks.  

While the Project Department acts as a coordinator for all matters 

related to construction safety, the Group has delegated specific 

responsibilities to different parties, to facilitate the incorporation of 

safety considerations and manage the potential safety hazards from 

multiple perspectives at different stages of a construction project. We 

have also hired dedicated consultants that specialise in construction 

site health and safety for our key projects in China and Malaysia. We 

regard this action as an extra line of defence. 

Emergency preparedness 

While we emphasise on preventing safety incidents, we also prepare 

the employees to handle and respond to emergencies, including 

potential accidents and fire. This is very important to reduce and limit 

the impact and casualty as a result of the any safety incidents that 

may happen in our line of work. Emergency response procedures is 

an important part of our Safety Management Policy. 

In addition, we have in place a series of emergency response 

procedures for our property management division for the following: 

• 

Fire 

• 

Flood 

• 

Torrential rain 

• 

Typhoon preparation 

• 

Power outage 

•

3.4 Environmental sustainability 

Overview 

We are committed to constructing and managing world-

class sustainable buildings that add tangible value to the 

communities we serve and to operate and maintain those 

buildings with a strong emphasis on the triple bottom line 

of economy, environment and society. 

Managing our carbon footprint 

We are committed to positive action on climate change and dedicated 

to reducing the carbon emission in our daily operations. Employees 

are reminded to save electricity and fuel consumption through regular 

internal communications.  

To determine the carbon footprint, we collect energy usage data from 

each our businesses and then calculate our total annual greenhouse 

gas emissions.  

In 2017, Debao generated a carbon footprint of 5,366 tonnes of 

carbon dioxide emission (tCO2e), representing a carbon emission 

intensity of 18 tCO2e per million yuan of revenue. The emission 

mainly arises from purchased electricity used in the our properties 

which accounted for approximately 97% of the total carbon emission 

of Debao. 

 

 

 

18tCO2e 

Carbon emission intensity per 

million yuan of revenue 




Sustainability Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 

Debao Property Development Ltd | 13 

 

 

 

 

 

We follow the Greenhouse Gas Protocol established by the World 

Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable 

Development, the standard manual for measuring corporate 

greenhouse gas emissions. Using the “control method”, we include 

100% of the emissions associated with businesses which we directly 

control. Our carbon footprint includes:  

• 

All fuels used directly by our companies (Scope 1 emissions) 

• 

All purchased electricity used in our properties (Scope 2 

emissions) 

• 

Impact of business air travel (optional Scope 3 emissions) 

We will continue to monitor the performance on the carbon emission 

reduction. Progress and performance on the reduction of carbon 

emission will be reported in the following year. 

Energy efficiency 

Buildings are energy-intensive structures and electricity often 

constitutes a significant proportion of operating expenses. By 

investing in energy efficiency, we not only help protect the 

environment but can also lower our financial costs.  

In 2017, Debao recorded an electricity consumption of 6.72 gigawatt-

hours (GWh), representing an electricity consumption intensity of 

22.5 megawatt-hours (MWh)per million yuan of revenue. 

To enhance our existing assets, we have allocated considerable 

resources to the refurbishment of existing properties. Initiatives over 

the past years include replacing conventional light bulbs with LED 

light bulbs. 

Water conservation 

Water scarcity is a growing concern around the world and a serious 

global challenge that we must work together to address.  

In 2017, Debao recorded a water consumption of 314,071 litres, 

representing a water consumption intensity of 1,053 litres per million 

yuan of revenue. 

We have adopted a wide range of measures to reduce water 

consumption at our properties, including installing water-efficient 

fittings and raising awareness of water scarcity issues among our 

employees, tenants, customers, and communities.

3.5 Employee motivation 

Overview 

We have a comprehensive performance appraisal 

programme and rewards system based on the result of 

the appraisal. The performance appraisal programme is 

essential for us to understand the skills level of the 

employees and appropriate training programmes can be 

designed to fill up the skill gaps.  

We emphasise on the career path and progression of our 

employees, and have built several two-way 

communication channels to ensure the career 

development needs of our employees are taken into 

consideration whenever it is possible. Training 

opportunities are equal to all employees based on needs 

identified. 

Though these efforts, we are well-positioned to provide a 

constructive working experience to our employees and 

contribute to the economic development and skilled 

labour resources of the local community. 

Skills competency and employee training 

To ensure that our employee excel, we emphasise on continuous 

learning in the workplace. Every employee has equal opportunities to 

upgrade and sharpen their skill sets through formal and on-the-job 

internal training programs. 

In 2017, Debao invested an average of 10 hours of training on each 

employee. 

Performance appraisal  

To ensure the Company achieves its goals, we have various 

performance appraisal methods in place to determine the 

performance of the Company as well as each individual employee.  

The employee performance appraisal comprises mainly quantifiable 

evaluation criteria. In addition, we actively collects performance 

information for each employee each month through inputs from direct 

supervisors and feedbacks, as well as periodical employee 

communication sessions.  

These collected information allow us to understand the performance 

and skills development needs of each team and individual employee 

from multiple aspects. This is crucial for the Company to develop 

annual training programs for employee that are designed to enhance 

the skills of the employee and aims to improve the overall 

productivity.

Equal opportunity 

Debao has always been an equal opportunity employer to provide a 

fair workplace for employees, following the principles of equality and 

non-discrimination. Recruitment, remuneration, promotion, and 

benefits are required to be handled based on objective assessment, 

equal opportunity and non-discrimination regardless of gender, race, 

marital status, pregnancy, disability, age or family status.  

We attract talent through fair, and flexible recruitment strategy that 

includes recruitment application, job description, job applications, 

interview, selection, approval, and job offer. Promotion is based on 

performance and suitability.  

We offer competitive remuneration to attract and retain talented staff 

members. Remuneration packages (which include the necessary 

social benefits) are reviewed periodically to ensure consistency with 

employment market. Dismissal also complies with employment laws 

and regulations relating to non-discrimination. 

In 2017, female employees comprise 36% of our entire workforce, 

with female representation in management at 40%. 

Encouraging work-life balance  

We organised a variety of employee activities to help them relax their 

mind and body, develop teamwork, explore their talent, so as to 

develop a positive attitude in both work and life.  

To enhance employee teamwork and cohesion, improve employee 

health and improve employee work-life balance, Debao has been 

organising periodic employee gatherings during major festivals and 

sports competitions.
