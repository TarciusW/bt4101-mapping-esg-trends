ABOUT

THIS REPORT

ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited reaffirms our commitment 

to sustainability, with the publication of our fourth standalone 

Sustainability Report prepared in accordance with the Global 

Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) Standards: Core option. 

The report focusses on topics which have been deemed as 

material to ComfortDelGro’s businesses and key Stakeholders, 

based on the economic, environmental and social impact 

caused by our everyday activities. A Materiality Assessment was 

conducted in FY2015 and the assessment has been reviewed 

internally and remains valid.

 

To affirm the importance of having a sustainability strategy 

on our corporate agenda, the position of Group Chief Risk &amp; 

Sustainability Officer (GCRSO) was created in November 2018. 

The GCRSO is responsible for the development of the Group’s 

global sustainability strategy, and will drive and deepen our 

sustainability efforts, so as to create shared value for the Group 

and our Stakeholders. 

Your feedback is welcome and you can reach us at 

sustainability@comfortdelgro.com.

REPORTING PERIOD AND SCOPE 

This Sustainability Report articulates ComfortDelGro’s sustainability 

ambition across all our operations around the world, and provides 

a detailed account of performance where data is currently 

available. It is based on the Group’s financial year from 1 January 

to 31 December 2018 and is produced annually. 

As SBS Transit and VICOM are also listed on the Singapore 

Exchange, we have produced their figures separately in this 

Sustainability Report. 

This Sustainability Report supplements ComfortDelGro’s Annual 

Report 2018, which can be found on our corporate website www.

comfortdelgro.com. It underscores our commitment to keep 

all Stakeholders – Customers, Employees, Investors, Business 

Partners, Regulators and Community members – abreast of 

efforts and developments in the field of Environmental, Social 

and Governance (ESG). In accordance with our efforts to be 

more environmentally friendly, this Report is only available on 

our website.

INDEPENDENT CONSULTANCY 

An independent Sustainability consulting firm, Paia Consulting, was 

appointed to provide external assistance with the development 

of the contents of this Report, in line with the GRI Standards. 

We intend to seek external assurance in the future.




STATEMENT

BY THE BOARD

Sustainability is a key pillar of the Group’s 

overall strategy and one that the Board 

pays close attention to. In particular, 

we consider environmental, social and 

governance (ESG) issues as part of our 

strategic formulation.

02

ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited




Our global sustainability strategy focusses on three key areas: 

our products, our planet and our people. 

Being in the land transport business, we are cognisant that the 

delivery of our services has a direct impact on the environment. 

To this end, we have and continue to work closely with Regulators 

as well as vehicle manufacturers and suppliers to reduce our 

overall carbon footprint. We are encouraged by the advancement 

of technology and are keeping close tabs on developments in 

the field of Green technology. We are already operating hybrid 

buses and taxis, and have been working with manufacturers and 

Regulators on electric vehicle trials. Certainly, technological 

advancements will have a significant impact on the way we 

operate and our environmental footprint.

 

Our people, and the people we serve, is another area of focus. 

From the health and safety of our employees to the support for 

the socially disadvantaged, we are constantly looking at ways to 

improve. Our employees are committed to projects and activities 

that contribute to society and help protect the environment. 

ESG matters as determined by our Stakeholders and deemed to 

be material to value creation are integrated into our balanced 

scorecard, which is used to set objectives, drive behaviours, 

measure performance and determine remuneration. The Board 

has reviewed and approved the material issues, and has delegated 

the management and monitoring to Senior Management.

For more information on risk management, please refer to pages 

85 to 87 in the ComfortDelGro Annual Report 2018.

Corporate governance is also something that the Board watches 

closely. As a company that conducts business on a global 

scale, we are committed to nurturing a corporate culture that 

encourages employees to act ethically and with a strong sense 

of mission in meeting the needs of customers and to ensuring 

transparent management and fair decision-making. In this 

regard, the adoption of the corporate auditor system has helped 

us increase the effectiveness of the auditing and monitoring 

functions fulfilled by Auditors. Moreover, we are enhancing 

the management oversight function of the Board of Directors 

by implementing appropriate measures such as reviewing the 

terms of reference of all Board Committees.

For more information on corporate governance, please refer 

to pages 60 to 81 in the ComfortDelGro Annual Report 2018.

MATERIALITY

Materiality guides ComfortDelGro on issues to 

focus on for long-term sustainability. An in-depth 

materiality assessment based on internal and external 

stakeholder expectations was conducted in 2015. 

The issues that have been identified as material to us are 

environmental and social issues that reflect significant 

impacts of our operations, or could substantively influence 

the assessments and decisions of our Stakeholders. Based 

on international best practice, we have made an initial 

prioritisation of the issues using the internationally accepted 

AccountAbility 5-Part Materiality Test model, embedded in 

the AA1000 standard. 

The materiality assessment involved ComfortDelGro’s Senior 

Management as well as External Stakeholders. Their rating 

is shown in the diagram provided. The Board has reviewed 

and approved the material issues, and has delegated the 

management and monitoring to Senior Management.

ANTI-CORRUPTION 

Business and ethical integrity are pillars of our corporate 

psyche. The ComfortDelGro Group does not tolerate 

corruption in any part of its business. Our fight against 

corruption is guided by the following principles:

• 

The ComfortDelGro Group shall not participate in or 

endorse any corrupt practices. 

• 

Representatives of the Group shall not offer Customers, 

Potential Customers, Suppliers, Consultants, Governments, 

Agencies of Governments, or any representative of such 

entities, any rewards or benefits in violation of applicable 

laws or established business practices stricter than 

applicable laws, in order to obtain or retain business 

or to gain any other improper advantage. 

• 

Our employees shall not accept payments, gifts or 

other kinds of reimbursement from a third party that 

could affect or appear to affect their objectivity in their 

business decisions.

• 

We believe in full transparency and according equal 

treatment to all existing and potential Suppliers.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

ComfortDelGro believes in creating long-term economic  

value for our Shareholders as well as the key Stakeholders 

by adopting responsible business practices and growing 

the business in a sustainable manner. Details of the Group’s  

economic performance for 2018 can be found in our  

Annual Report 2018.

DIVERSITY AND NON-DISCRIMINATION

ComfortDelGro embraces diversity. We believe in creating an 

inclusive environment where our employees treat each other 

equally, honestly and with respect. We want to nurture a culture 

where diverse perspectives can help drive our Group forward. 

We strive to provide a fair and supportive work environment for 

all our employees, regardless of their age, sex, marital status, 

sexual orientation, disability, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or 

national origin, religion, or affiliation to any political party or 

trade union. We aim to employ people who reflect the diverse 

nature of society and we value each of our employees for the 

contribution they make, both individually, and as part of the Group.

Our policy applies to recruitment and selection, terms and 

conditions of employment including pay, promotion, training, 

transfer, references and every other aspect of employment.

ACCESSIBILITY

As a provider of land transport services, accessibility is a critical 

part of our business focus. We are committed to providing 

our services equitably to serve all Customers – independent 

of age or ability. To this end, we invest extensively in systems, 

processes and new technologies including wheelchair-accessible 

and low-floor buses. We are also committed to making our 

workplace accessible to our employees. For example, ramps 

and lift access as well as wheelchair-accessible restrooms are 

available at many of our buildings both locally and overseas.

EMPLOYEE TRAINING

ComfortDelGro invests continually in its employees to develop 

their skills and talent. We ensure that employees understand 

their responsibilities and are given access to necessary training 

to equip them to do their jobs better.

LOCAL COMMUNITIES

ComfortDelGro is committed to community contribution in 

all the regions we operate in. We actively reach out in various 

areas including education, welfare, disaster relief and health. 

Community engagement forms an important part of our business 

not only because it breeds trust and familiarity, but because 

it gives a human face to the business. We also find that our 

employees tend to be happier when they feel that they have 

made a difference in the lives of others.

While most of the material issues are relevant to all our Business 

Units, issues like Public Policy, Accessibility and Local Communities 

are most relevant for our bus and train businesses. Environmental 

material issues are of highest significance for our bus, train and 

taxi businesses.

HEALTH &amp; SAFETY

As a land transport Group, managing the health and safety 

of our customers, our employees and the public is not just a 

priority, it is a necessity. With close to 43,300 vehicles plying 

the roads in seven countries, we have in place stringent checks, 

systems and processes to ensure that safety and health is never 

compromised. Safety requirements are incorporated in tender 

documents for relevant products and services. We have also 

invested heavily in training and re-training courses, and run 

safety awareness and training programmes to instil a safety 

and security conscious culture in employees at all levels. This 

safety focus continues to be strongly reflected in the Group’s 

policies, procedures and training.

LABOUR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS, 

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT

Our people are undoubtedly our most valued assets. Without 

them, we would not be where we are today. Indeed, we strongly 

subscribe to the view that a happy and motivated workforce 

will ultimately translate into happy and satisfied customers. In 

the long run, this can only result in growth for the organisation. 

To this end, we provide equal opportunities to our staff, invest 

in comprehensive training to develop them to their maximum 

potential and engage them actively in what we do. Significantly, 

as an employer, we ensure that all terms and conditions of 

employment, along with policies and procedures, comply with 

relevant regulations.

PUBLIC POLICY AND REGULATORY 

FRAMEWORK

ComfortDelGro engages with Governments at many different 

levels to help shape public policy and regulations that support 

the land transport sector. We also work closely with Regulators, 

Association Partners and Unions on issues which affect our 

business and our Stakeholders.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS: ENERGY USE AND 

AIR EMISSIONS, WATER CONSUMPTION AND 

WASTE MANAGEMENT

The ComfortDelGro Group is committed to managing 

and minimising the impact of our business operations on 

the environment, including along our supply chain. Our 

commitment to the environment is steadfast. Whether it is 

the vehicles we run or the buildings we operate in, we are 

committed to ensuring that our Green Quotient is kept high.

We endeavour to continue to improve the management of 

our environmental impacts by reducing resource usage and 

minimising waste. We are firmly committed to investing in 

new, more environmentally friendly vehicles, so as to reduce 

our emissions footprint.

07




The ComfortDelGro Group of Companies aims to minimise the impact of 

its activities on the environment by ensuring continuous improvement in 

environmental performance whilst bearing in mind prevailing technical and 

operational constraints. The Group is also committed to complying with all 

statutory and regulatory requirements. 

Our overall goal in environmental management is to minimise the harmful 

effects of our operations across Singapore, the United Kingdom, Ireland, 

China, Australia, Vietnam and Malaysia on the environment. By striving to 

reduce the environmental footprint of each passenger journey, ComfortDelGro 

can contribute to reductions in air pollution from road transport and carbon 

dioxide emissions. A complete elimination of harmful emissions is however 

not possible and we will explore how best we can offset any negative impact 

we have on the environment.

We endeavour to continue to improve the management of our environmental 

impacts by reducing resource usage and minimising waste. We will continue 

to make on-going investments in new vehicles so as to reduce our emissions 

profile and we will continue to support research into alternative fuels.

THE GREEN STATEMENT

08

ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited




09

Sustainability Report 2018

ENVIRONMENT

Man’s activities have impacted the climate system 

in many ways and the awareness of climate change 

has grown steadily over the years. Harmful emissions 

directly and indirectly cause the loss of biodiversity 

and have severe environmental, social, health and 

economic consequences. These pose tough challenges 

to Governments and companies alike as they strive to 

come up with strategies, policies and actions to reduce 

and halt the impact on our environment. There is an 

urgent need to innovate and target for sustainable 

growth so that the present and future generations can 

enjoy a clean and sustainable environment.

The ComfortDelGro Group is committed to minimising the 

environmental impact of its operations. In fact, the very nature 

of a large part of our business is to try to steer communities 

away from the use of private cars. Indeed, studies have found 

that public transport, on average, consumes 3.4 times less 

energy per passenger kilometre than automobiles. This ratio is 

even more favourable during rush hour.

As we reinforce our commitment to the environment, we have 

set a short-term target of reducing carbon emissions by 1-3% 

over the next one to three years. 

We endeavour to continue to improve the management of our 

environmental impact by reducing resource usage and minimising 

waste. We are firmly committed to investing in new, more 

environmentally friendly vehicles, so as to reduce our emissions 

footprint. In fact, Business Units such as ComfortDelGro Taxi, 

have even stopped purchasing diesel vehicles.

We effectively manage energy efficiency, air emissions, waste 

and water consumption. Our environmental policy has been 

implemented for more than a decade under the supervision of our 

Green Committee, involving Senior Management and all relevant 

Business Units/Central Functions. ComfortDelGro compiles the 

necessary data and reviews its performance regularly, deciding 

on and implementing improvement measures.

Our longer term environmental goals are:

• 

To improve our emissions profile per passenger journey and 

per passenger kilometre;

• 

To reduce waste and to increase the proportion of waste 

reused/recycled;

• 

To improve the environmental management standards across 

the Group;

• 

To continue to encourage and promote the use of public 

transport so as to ensure a modal shift away from car use;

• 

To continue to support initiatives on research and trial the 

use of alternative fuels;

• 

To continuously work at inculcating and strengthening the 

Green Culture amongst the staff.

To achieve this, we will:

• 

Identify, assess and actively manage all material aspects of 

our environmental impact;

• 

Continually improve the environmental performance and 

minimise impact through resource and energy management 

and pollution prevention;

• 

Manage our carbon footprint and energy consumption 

through use of technology, process improvements, energy 

optimisation and other efficiency measures; and

• 

Adopt plans and measures throughout our operations and 

infrastructure to mitigate the longer term risks of climate 

change.

VEHICLE EMISSIONS PROFILE

ComfortDelGro has always been among the first adopters of 

the Government’s Green Policies in deploying suitable vehicles 

for service in support of the environment. All over the world, we 

are converting our fleets to higher standards, with hybrids and 

electric vehicles (EVs). In all, Green vehicles make up slightly 

more than half of our close to 43,300-strong vehicles worldwide.

A significant trend in the transport industry is the roll-out of 

cleaner, less pollutant vehicles – namely electric, hybrid, fuel 

cells or Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). 

Car manufacturers are responding to this demand by going 

electric or hybrid in their new models. They are also promising 

that their vehicles can travel for comfortable distances in 

between charging. 

In Singapore, we expect to phase out diesel in our taxi operations 

by 2024. In fact, ComfortDelGro Taxi had put two fully-electric 

Hyundai Ioniq taxis on trial in November 2018. Unlike existing 

electric taxis here that takes a couple of hours to charge, this 

electric Ioniq taxi – the first of its kind here – charges fully in 

just under 30 minutes. A fully charged electric Ioniq taxi travels 

more than 200km, but the cost of charging it fully is only a-third 

of the cost of diesel for the same distance. 

In January 2019, ComfortDelGro expanded its EV trial with the 

latest Hyundai long-range fully electric vehicles. The Hyundai 

Kona Electric taxi comes with a 64 kWh lithium polymer battery 

– twice the power of the battery of the fully electric Hyundai 

Ioniq. This means that this EV model is able to travel up to about 

350km when fully charged. And, with Direct Current (DC) fast 




10

ENVIRONMENT

charging capabilities, the vehicle fully charges up in just slightly 

more than an hour.

 

To support the EV trial, ComfortDelGro became the first in 

Singapore to introduce DC fast charging for EV for commercial 

use. The Terra 54 CG charging station, is operated by the 

Group’s wholly-owned subsidiary ComfortDelGro Engineering 

in partnership with global EV charging software and solutions 

provider, Greenlots.

As at December 2018, our taxi fleet in Singapore comprised 

18.3% Euro 4 taxis, 63.3% Euro 5 taxis, 2% Euro 6 taxis and 

16.5% hybrid taxis.

In China, we invest in dual-fuelled taxis that run on both CNG and 

petrol. Over 70% of the fleet in China is environmentally friendly 

CNG vehicles. Nanjing ComfortDelGro Dajian Taxi operates a 

total of 679 CNG-driven taxis while Chengdu ComfortDelGro 

Taxi operates a total of 488 CNG-driven taxis.

We do not just buy Green vehicles, we also work hand in hand 

with our vehicle manufacturers and fuel suppliers in the field 

of Green Engineering, providing them with valuable feedback 

about the engineering performance of prototype vehicles and 

fuel technologies.  

From 1 January 2018, diesel vehicles have to meet the Euro 6 

emission standards, up from Euro 5 previously. In line with this, 

our listed subsidiary, VICOM had added Euro 6 and JPN 2009 

into its scope of emission tests. 

In 2018, ComfortDelGro Engineering bought a purposed built 

machine from Italy for the re-conditioning of the diesel exhaust 

particulate filter (DPF). This machine uses hydro-chemical effect 

to treat choked DPF making it more environmentally friendly. It 

is also capable of treating severely choked DPFs which would 

otherwise be disposed as scrap. To-date, 1,385 DPFs have been 

reconditioned. 

Our global bus fleet is also at the forefront of Green technology.

In Australia, ComfortDelGro Corporation Australia (CDC) in 

Victoria had succeeded in its endeavour to introduce the largest 

hybrid bus fleet in Melbourne. As part of its deliverables under 

the new metropolitan bus contract, 50 of its diesel buses will 

be replaced with Volvo Euro 6 hybrid vehicles. Mechanics were 

also trained in preparation for the new technology.

In United Kingdom (UK), Metroline is keeping in line with its 

philosophy to maintain a young, environmentally friendly fleet. 

Hybrid buses make up more than 20% of its fleet of 1,830 buses. 

After launching the world’s first all-electric, zero-emission 

double deck bus service in London in 2018, Metroline began 

operations of the existing Route 46 using 23 fully-electric 

single deck buses. In 2019, it will be commencing operation of 

fully-electric double deck buses on Route 43 at Holloway and 

Route 134 at Potters Bar.

In 2018, SBS Transit, our listed subsidiary and a major public bus 

operator in Singapore, had 3,471 buses in its fleet, of which 78% 

is Euro 5-compliant or better. This was an increase of 244 buses 

or 11% compared to the previous year. This also meant that its 

fleet emit less pollutants into the environment, thereby reducing 

its carbon footprint. The average age of its fleet was about seven 

years. It also operated a total of 222 bus routes in 2018, up from 

208 in 2017, while the mileage of its buses increased to 203.3 

million km in 2018, up from 191 million km in 2017.

In October 2018, it received 25 of 50 Volvo B5LH diesel hybrid 

buses (DHBs) that have been procured by the Land Transport 

Authority (LTA) for fleet trials. These DHBs are expected to be 

more emissions friendly to the environment and also reduce 

operations and maintenance cost by up to 23%. The six-month 

trials started in December 2018 and had been deployed across 

three different bus services. 

ENERGY EFFICIENCY

Being in the land transport business, energy efficiency ranks 

high on our priority list. This is especially important given the 

amount of time our vehicles spend on the road. Most of our 

taxis, for example, run practically non-stop as the bulk of them 

operate on dual shifts.

In all, our operations consumed about 1,077 GJ of fuel in 2018.1 

We are closely monitoring the development of renewable energy 

sources and will explore the adoption of such energy sources 

when it is feasible to do so. 

Better fuel efficiency was achieved through initiatives like EcoDrive 

in the UK and Scania Optimise in Australia, where drivers are trained 

on how to maximise fuel efficiency. In the Optimise system, the 

driving performance of drivers is tracked and weekly reports 

provided to show them how they have performed in reducing 

emissions and fuel consumption.

1 

Fuel sources include petrol, diesel, CNG, and the gas supply in the United Kingdom (UK).

SBS Transit took over the operation of the newly-built Ulu Pandan 

Bus Depot in July 2018, which was purpose built to house 470 

buses. The 102,000 square metres depot is the first to have the 

Photovoltaic Solar Panel System, which comprises more than 

2,000 solar panels generating about 2,500kWh of electricity. 

The depot is expected to consume about 70% of the solar 

energy and the remaining 30% can be sold back to the power 

grid, with the proceeds translating to a net saving of about 30% 

in electricity costs.

In 2018, Greenhouse Gas emissions from fuel and electricity for 

our major bus, taxi and rail businesses in Australia, Singapore 

and the UK registered carbon emissions of about 1,157,916 

tonnes of CO2 equivalent5.

RIGOROUS MAINTENANCE

Under the LTA regulations, all buses must go for half-yearly 

Roadworthiness Certification conducted by authorised inspection 

centres. This inspection involves checking the steering, oil leakage, 

suspension system, corrosion, brakes and smoke emission. The 

bodywork of buses is also checked for passenger safety and the 

buses put through a Chassis Dynamometer Smoke Test. SBS 

Transit achieved a 100% pass rate for 2018.

6 

Waste disposal includes Singapore, Australia, China and the UK.

WASTE MANAGEMENT

Day-to-day operational waste and waste generated from the 

commuters contribute to the bulk of the general waste of the 

business. These wastes are generally removed by authorised 

contractors to be disposed at landfills or incinerated. 

As for hazardous wastes, they are typically generated from the 

repair and maintenance of vehicles. Similarly, the hazardous 

wastes are collected within specific containers and removed 

by specialist contractors. This ensures that all hazardous items 

are responsibly disposed.

In 2018, our businesses generated 7,476 tonnes of waste materials 

(Table 3), which include batteries, engine oil, tyres, metal, drums, 

papers and cartons6.

Recycling bins are placed at strategic locations in our offices to 

encourage staff to recycle. Recycling days are also organised 

where employees are encouraged to bring paper, plastic and 

cans from their homes for “deposit” into the bins.

In our Singapore bus depots, our technicians started the use of 

tablets instead of paper checklists and forms when carrying out 

maintenance works. Using the Bus Mobile Maintenance System 

(BMMS), they obtain work instructions, drawings, electrical 

schematics and parts information to carry out their work. 

They are also able to access the bus manufacturers’ portal to 

obtain more detailed bus maintenance information from their 

e-manuals. The use of the BMMS not only improves efficiency 

and storage, but also reduces paper usage. 

Paper consumption in our Singapore and the UK’s operations 

decreased from 38,992 reams in 2017 to 36,095 reams in 2018. A 

total of 51,025kg of paper and cartons was collected for recycling 

in Singapore in 2018 – a decrease from 70,505kg in 2017.

ENVIRONMENT

WATER

The most significant use of water in the Group pertains to the 

washing of vehicles. 

The new Singapore Ulu Pandan Bus Depot is the first to use 

NEWater for non-potable uses such as bus washing. This will 

result in savings in potable water consumption of more than 

9,000m3 per year, which is equivalent to the size of nearly four 

Olympic-sized swimming pools.

SUPPORTING COMMUNITY INITIATIVES

On Eco Action Day, which fell on 5 June 2018, ComfortDelGro 

Group organised an e-waste collection drive. Close to 500 

items, including handphones, laptops, monitors, keyboards, 

cables, earphones, and even shredders were collected in two 

months and eventually sold to a recycling vendor.

VICOM and SETSCO also supported the “Eco Action Day 

Recycling Campaign” by donating 4,500 sets of newspapers 

EXTERNAL RECOGNITION

ComfortDelGro first received the Eco Office Label from SEC in 

December 2009. We were recertified in 2012, 2015 and then 

again on 16 March 2018. Each certification lasts for three years 

from the date of certification. 

Having met both the technical competence requirements and 

management system requirements, the VICOM Emission Test 

Laboratory successfully cleared the International Standard 

ISO/IEC 17025:2005 surveillance assessment by the Singapore 

Accreditation Council in August 2018. 

VICOM completed and cleared the surveillance assessment 

in accordance to the International Standard ISO 9001:2015 in 

October 2018.

SETSCO has been accredited as a Certification Body for the 

Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme (WELS) products administered 

by Public Utilities Board (PUB). WELS is a mandatory grading 

system with 0/1/2/3 tick rating denoting the water efficiency 

level of a product. It is administered by PUB and covers taps 

and mixers, dual-flush low capacity flushing cisterns, urinal flush 

valves and waterless urinal, washing machines and dishwashers 

for household use. It is mandatory for suppliers and retailers 

to obtain the relevant water efficiency labels for their products 

before advertising and displaying them for sale in Singapore.



to Willing Hearts, a charity that operates a soup kitchen, for its 

food preparation.

In addition, VICOM and SETSCO supported PROJECT ‘RETHINK 

Plastic’ which was organised by the Singapore Environment 

Council (SEC) to promote the three Rs – Reduce, Reuse and 

Recycle. Through this project, 350 bookmarks created from 

recycled plastics were sponsored as door gifts during the 

Singapore Environmental Achievement Award 2018.  

Nanjing ComfortDelGro Daijian Taxi continued with their 

cultivation of 500 trees that were planted in 2012, in order to 

reduce the environmental footprint of each passenger’s journey.

Besides organising various Green events throughout the year, 

ComfortDelGro also actively encourages staff to use water and 

electricity responsibly. Tips on how to save water, electricity 

and other resources – not just in the office but at home too – 

are regularly communicated to staff, either through emails or 

through notice board posters.

HEALTH

&amp; SAFETY

The health and safety of our customers, employees, relevant 

Stakeholders and the public is of critical importance to 

us as a Group. With close to 43,300 vehicles plying the 

roads in seven countries, we have in place stringent 

checks, systems and processes to ensure that health 

and safety is never compromised. As passenger injury 

rate for every kilometre travelled increased in 2018, 

we will continue to invest heavily in training and re-

training, and focus on running awareness and training 

programmes to instil and reinforce a safety and security 

conscious culture in employees at all levels. This focus 

continues to be strongly reflected in the Group’s policies, 

procedures and training.

YEAR IN REVIEW

Road and passenger safety has, and will continue to be, a 

key area of focus for the Group. Since 2016, our health and 

safety statistics cover our businesses in the United Kingdom 

(UK) and Australia, in addition to Singapore. Accident statistics 

were recorded and reported in line with each country’s safety 

reporting regulations4. 

There had been no incidents of non-compliance with regulation 

and voluntary codes concerning the health and safety impacts 

of products and services during their life cycle.

SINGAPORE5

For 2018, the Group’s vehicles in Singapore made trips totalling 

1,810.69 million kilometres6. The bulk of this was made by our 

taxis (87%). Public scheduled buses accounted for about 11.2% 

of total distance travelled. 

Accidents resulting in 788 injury cases were recorded, 781 of 

which were from SBS Transit. This translated into 3.39 passenger 

injuries1 per one million kilometre travelled in Singapore, which 

was higher than 2017. There were, unfortunately, two passenger 

fatalities. The first was caused by an SBS Transit bus hitting a 

pedestrian at a signal-controlled crossing, while the second 

incident happened when a car rear-ended a moving SBS Transit 

bus, resulting in a passenger sustaining fatal injuries. In terms 

of vehicle collisions, we averaged 0.32 collisions for every one 

million kilometres with a total of 583 collisions7, out of which 

364 were from SBS Transit.

To reduce such accidents, SBS Transit increased its efforts in 

safety training and re-training. It had, in 2018, installed Mobileye 

– a smart camera that is able to detect, analyse and monitor 

road conditions while the vehicle is moving and provide real-

time audio visual warning via a display unit to the driver – in 

about one-third of its buses. It also trialled Mobileye Shield+, 

a system that scans blind spots as the bus travels in a straight 

motion or navigates a curve so that Bus Captains (BCs) are 

aware of vulnerable road users such as motorcyclists, cyclists 

and pedestrians. 

Tapping on telematics, SBS Transit uses the SAfe Green Eco 

System (SAGE) that provides real-time feedback through audio 

and visual alerts upon detecting events such as harsh braking or 

harsh acceleration. Its “Golden Eye” system, on the other hand, 

features an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Box that sends visual, audio 

and even haptic alerts to BCs via a display unit on board the 

buses if signs of fatigue and distractions are detected.

HEALTH &amp; SAFETY

The Group recorded zero workplace fatalities in Singapore. A total 

of 76 non-fatal workplace injuries8, resulting in 1,552 lost days9 

in 2018, were recorded. Of these cases, the majority involved 

male employees. A very small proportion of incidents involved 

contract workers. Analysing the data, we see that workplace 

non-fatal injuries were mainly due to:

• 

Slips, Trips and Falls (38%); 

• 

Injured By or Struck Against Moving or Stationary Objects (30%); 

and 

• 

Work-related Traffic Accidents/Struck by Moving Vehicle 

(19%).

in 334 lost days in 2018. These were due to slips, trips and falls 

within garages and road traffic collisions. Injuries included cuts 

and burns, shoulder and whiplash injuries. Compared to 2017, 

the AFR was higher at 3.25, while the ASR was lower at 20.84. 

We will work towards reducing the AFR.

In Australia, ComfortDelGro Corporation Australia (CDC) buses 

travelled a total of 81.4 million kilometres in 2018.

A total of 294 injury cases was recorded during the year, translating 

into 3.61 passenger injuries per one million kilometres travelled. 

There was a fatality recorded for the year. A pedestrian, who intended 

to commit suicide, had jumped right in front of a moving CDC 

bus. In terms of vehicle collisions, CDC averaged 30.10 collisions 

for every one million kilometres with a total of 2,450 collisions. 

As for workplace injuries, we recorded 202 cases due mainly 

to accidents as well as slips, trips and falls. Injuries sustained, 

including musculoskeletal injuries, specifically strains and sprains 

of backs, upper arms and legs, as well as general lacerations 

and contusions, resulted in 1,914 lost days in 2018. About 87.6% 

of the injured were male employees. We will continue to work

WORKPLACE SAFETY &amp; HEALTH COMMITTEES

One of the ways in which the Group manages its health and 

safety issues is through its Workplace Safety &amp; Health (WSH) 

Committees (See Annex A).

Singapore

In Singapore, all our Business Units (BUs) have dedicated WSH 

Committees. This decentralised approach is more effective as it 

enables us to engage staff at the BU level. It also instils in them a 

sense of ownership over health and safety issues that arise from 

day-to-day operations. Senior Management is involved actively 

in the Committees. 

ComfortDelGro Driving Centre, in particular, has an Accident 

Review Committee which was formed to evaluate and assess 

accidents, as well as develop learning points before providing 

counsel for preventive measures. The Committee has a high 

participation rate from its Management and staff. Findings from 

the review are shared during monthly dialogue sessions with staff 

and new instructors before they are deployed on the ground. 

United Kingdom

In the UK, Metroline’s WSH Committees, which are decentralised, 

meet at least every quarter and are responsible for all local 

health and safety issues. Scottish Citylink Coaches has a WSH 

Committee that meets every quarter, while CityFleet Networks 

in London has both a centralised Risk Management Committee 

and Company Emergency Response Team (CERT), which meet 

every six months. 

Australia

Each of the depots in CDC has a Workplace Health &amp; Safety (WHS) 

Committee comprising Management and staff representatives. 

These teams meet every quarter – sometimes even monthly. 

A General Manager-Safety &amp; Risk, jointly appointed by CDC, 

reviews and streamlines all safety, risk and workers’ compensation 

across the broader business. He is also in charge of creating and 

implementing Business Continuity Plans for both operations in 

New South Wales and Victoria. 

Swan Taxis formed an Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) 

Committee in 2017. It also has a three-member Incident Response 

Group and an eight-member Crisis Management Group, headed 

by the CEO, who meets them when required.

r All of Australia’s 2017 figures have been restated due to a duplication error.


18

ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited

HEALTH &amp; SAFETY

China

In China, some BUs have WSH while for others, Management 

takes the lead in conducting health and safety briefings as well 

as organising regular emergency exercises to ensure its staff 

are responsive at all times. In Guangzhou, in place of a WSH 

Committee is a nine-member Safety Production Committee, 

which meets once a quarter.

Vietnam

In Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam Taxi has fire-fighting teams as 

regulatory requirements. It also has a Labour Safety Committee 

since 2017, comprising four members led by a Management 

representative. 

EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS

To respond appropriately to potential emergency situations, all 

our BUs regularly assess operational and safety risks related to 

their operations and take adequate precautionary measures. 

For example, ComfortDelGro Driving Centre, which builds its 

entire business model on safe and responsible driving, conducts 

mandatory safety briefings for all learners. It also sends its driving 

instructors for first aid training, which is certified once every two 

years. In 2018, 21 driving instructors underwent first aid training 

to equip them with the necessary skills should accidents happen 

while practical training is being conducted.

SETSCO also trained its first aid assistants to ensure they are 

equally ready should designated first-aiders be unavailable. Various 

company-wide emergency drills simulating gas leaks and fires 

are also conducted to improve the awareness and emergency 

response of all staff. 

SBS Transit conducted two bus disruption exercises and three rail 

disruption exercises with North East Line (NEL) and Downtown Line 

(DTL) in 2018. A joint exercise with the Singapore Civil Defence 

Force that puts response and rescue operations to the test during 

emergencies was also carried out on DTL, while exercises testing 

contingency plans during a flood were carried out on both lines. 

In China, Guangzhou Xin Tian Wei Transportation Development’s 

Tianhe Bus Station carried out fire drills to test its staff’s knowledge 

of the evacuation process. CDC in Sydney and Melbourne held 

“toolbox” talks that focus on safe work practices.

All public buses in Singapore, Australia and the UK are equipped 

with call out buttons that allow our bus drivers to speak to the 

Operations Control Centre when there are emergencies. Similarly, 

our taxis in Singapore, Western Australia (WA), China and the UK 

come with distress buttons that taxi drivers can activate whenever 

they require emergency help.

TRAINING, PROTECTIVE EqUIPMENT &amp; 

PREVENTIVE MEASURES

ComfortDelGro constantly puts a high emphasis on training to 

safeguard and improve safety standards, both at the workplace 

and for our passengers. We also ensure that all staff are adequately 

protected with the proper protective gear depending on their 

vocation. 

We do not just contain fire-fighting training within the 

Group. 

For the whole month of August in 2018, car owners who 

had their vehicles inspected at the VICOM Inspection 

Centre in Sin Ming, had the opportunity to learn how 

to put out both a car and a kitchen fire with a fire 

extinguisher – training that is not typically available to 

members of the public – for free. 

Each training session, which was no more than 10 

minutes, included a demonstration on how to use a 

fire extinguisher, as well as hands-on fire extinguishing 

training under the guidance of a trainer from Lingjack 

Engineering Works, an established manufacturer of the 

Combat brand fire-fighting equipment.

BRINGING FIRE-FIGHTING  

TRAINING CLOSER TO THE PUBLIC




19

Sustainability Report 2018

To incentivise safe driving for taxi drivers, ComfortDelGro taxi 

drivers who maintain accident-free records for four consecutive 

years would not have to pay their share of repairs should they 

unfortunately meet with one thereafter. Drivers who are accident-

prone are sent for defensive driving courses at ComfortDelGro 

Driving Centre. Upon completion of the defensive driving course, 

taxi drivers’ accident records are monitored. Those involved in 

yet another accident within the six-month period would have 

their service contracts revoked. 

In China, safety is an integral part of monthly meetings and 

dialogue sessions that our Shenyang and Chengdu taxi companies 

have with their taxi drivers. Similarly, there are incentives and 

remedial training in place to shape safe practices and behaviour. 

All our staff, including SBS Transit’s bus and rail engineering 

staff and VICOM staff, are trained and qualified by accredited 

training agencies to perform their various jobs in accordance 

with stipulated regulation. When required, SETSCO staff will 

also attend safety orientation and site familiarisation courses 

organised by clients in the construction, shipyard, marine and 

oil/petrochemical sectors. 

For staff that are exposed to prolonged noise or radiation 

over-exposure risks, we have provided the necessary personal 

protection equipment (PPE), including ear mufflers or thermos-

luminescent dosimeter badges. The staff are also sent for annual 

medical check-ups. Other operations and technical staff are 

also provided with PPE such as boots, ear-plugs, safety vests, 

eye-wears and gloves.

PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE CHECKS &amp; 

VEHICLE INSPECTION

Our vehicle fleets in Singapore undergo regular preventive 

maintenance checks. 

ComfortDelGro taxis are checked once a month, while buses 

are checked once every 45 to 60 days. Rental cars undergo 

six-monthly preventive maintenance checks as part of road 

safety measures. 

As part of regulatory requirement, private rental vehicles that are 

at least three years old are inspected at our vehicle inspection 

and testing Business Unit, VICOM, to ensure they meet safety 

standards for roadworthiness. Buses and training vehicles are 

inspected yearly, and taxis half-yearly even during their first year.

In the UK, our London buses go through inspections as well, while 

our inter- and intra-City coaches are inspected every 28 days 

by subcontractors in line with the requirements laid by the 

Department of Transport. Taxi drivers under our radio circuit 

networks conduct daily basic checks of their taxis and have 

them serviced every 6,000 to 8,000 miles to ensure their 

roadworthiness.



At SBS Transit, all new BCs undergoing basic training are schooled 

in safe and defensive driving. Training is intensive and spans 

between 31 and 46 days, before they obtain the Omnibus Driver’s 

Vocational Licence. The new BCs have to undergo practical 

training and pass the Class 4A driving test stringently administered 

by the Traffic Police. Upon completion of the training, BCs are 

then paired with Service Mentors, who would accompany them 

on their trips and share with them practical safety.

Experienced BCs are also sent for refresher training courses. 

They are also regularly briefed and reminded to observe safe 

driving habits through actual case studies. Pedestrian Drills, 

Junction Drills and Bus Stop Drills are continually conducted. 

Random spot checks are held to ensure that all BCs comply 

with these safety drills. 

In NSW, CDC communicates customer service and safety 

messages to its bus drivers at its depots using diamond-shaped 

signs. These were first developed and launched by Hillsbus in 

2013, but have since been introduced at depots of Hunter Valley 

Buses, Blue Mountains Transit and Qcity Transit in Queanbeyan. 

Bus marshals are also put through rear door loading safety 

training to ensure they are able to assist passengers safely. 

In Victoria, CDC installed security screens on its buses to protect 

bus drivers from unruly passengers. It also introduced on-board 

voice announcements to eliminate the need for bus drivers to 

ask passengers for fares, and thereby the risks of them being 

verbally and physically assaulted by passengers.

In our global taxi operations, stringent screening of new taxi 

drivers, including going through their past safety records, is 

conducted before any agreement is inked. New taxi drivers have 

to go through an induction briefing, comprising basic service 

training that also highlights the importance of safe driving.

HEALTH &amp; SAFETY

Our Australian buses are maintained once a month in accordance 

with manufacturers’ recommendations. Buses in NSW are 

inspected twice a year, while buses in Victoria are inspected 

once a year. As for taxis, the State Government’s Department 

of Transport requires all taxis to undergo an annual inspection 

as part of the licensing agreement.

In Vietnam, taxis are also serviced at every 5,000 kilometres, 

which is around once every month, while in China, taxi companies 

like Jilin ComfortDelGro Taxi conducts inspection on its taxis 

to ensure they do not pose safety hazards while they are on 

the roads. 

TECHNOLOGY

At ComfortDelGro, we are always finding new ways to leverage 

on technology to improve the way we do things. Safety is no 

exception. 

SBS Transit continues to put its BCs through a mandatory 

“Driving Skills Enhancement Programme” to obtain an objective 

assessment of their driving competency with areas identified 

for improvement. This is done using the Vigil Vanguard system, 

which comprises motion sensors, cameras and mapping software. 

The BCs’ driving behaviour is closely reviewed to help them 

improve on their areas of weaknesses. 





At the ComfortDelGro Driving Centre, the Driver Assessment 

Tool is used to help trainees improve their driving skills. The 

tool uses real-time video recording, GPS tracking technology 

and telematics to track, observe and measure the trainee’s 

performance.  

In 2018, SBS Transit completed installing 1,000 of its buses 

with Mobileye, a smart camera that is able to detect, analyse 

and monitor road conditions while the vehicle is moving and 

provide real-time audio-visual warning via a display unit to the 

driver. SBS Transit also tested Mobileye Shield+ in 10 of its buses 

at the Bukit Merah depot. This system scans the blind spots as 

the bus travels in a straight motion or navigates curves so that 

BCs are aware of vulnerable road users such as motorcyclists, 

cyclists and pedestrians. Similarly, CDC installed Mobileye in 

more than 1,000 of their buses in NSW and Victoria.

SBS Transit also uses the SAGE which provides real-time feedback 

through audio and visual alerts upon detecting events such as 

harsh braking or harsh acceleration. Its “Golden Eye” system, on 

the other hand, features an AI Box that sends visual, audio and 

even haptic alerts to BCs via a display unit on board the buses 

if signs of fatigue and distractions are detected. The SAGE and 

Golden Eye systems are in addition to the GoRoute and HATT 

systems that had been introduced previously. 

Metroline did something similar. It filmed the bus routes that 

its probationary bus drivers practise on, and added animation 

to the footage to help them identify risk areas. In 2018, it 

extended the trial of audible alerts on 30 buses from Willesden 

Garage. Research focussed on the effectiveness of the alerts 

was undertaken by Leicester University. Results were mixed 

with divided opinion about the volume and frequency of the 

alerts. Whilst the trial has concluded, acoustic conspicuity is an 

integral feature in the Transport for London’s new specification 

for new bus orders placed in 2019.

In November 2018, the Group put advanced telematics 

devices to trial in about 100 of our vehicles, including taxis, 

private buses, rental vehicles and “learner” cars for four 

months. Data collected by these solutions was used to help 

ComfortDelGro’s drivers achieve safer and smarter driving 

habits. Taxi drivers were able to get real-time feedback on 

their driving patterns on a cell phone or tablet, while learner 

driver instructors were able to assess the performance of 

their trainees in detail. 

These telematics solutions were: 

• 

CDG Eye – a smartphone solution that utilises technology 

developed by Greater Than, a Swedish AI and technology 

service provider. Using advanced algorithms, CDG Eye 

tracks and assesses how drivers accelerate, retard and 

speed, rating drivers with stars and points after each 

trip. It also “gamifies” the environment by ranking the 

drivers against one another, with the top five drivers 

receiving monetary rewards every week.

• 

GreenRoad Driver Behaviour Solution – an in-vehicle 

solution that coaches the driver while he or she is behind 

the wheel, every minute of every journey. Displaying 

“green” when the driving is safe and smooth and 

“yellow” or “red” when the driving is risky, GreenRoad 

enables the driver to self-correct immediately, resulting 

in better driving, fewer collisions, better fuel economy 

and safer roads for all. With the ability to rate over 150 

manoeuvers, GreenRoad is able to give drivers concrete 

feedback on how to improve their cornering, lane-

changing, acceleration and braking skills, and to track 

their progress according to a motivating “Safety Score”.

TAPPING ON TELEMATICS

Metroline in London has also been using two fleet safety 

systems, including GreenRoad, for the last five years. CDC 

in NSW has installed the Verizon Telematics, which focusses 

on improving driver behaviour and provides remedial and 

preventive incident training, at its Northmead Depot.

Similarly, ComfortDelGro Engineering has installed CarTrack 

devices on 16 of its 18 corporate vehicles, comprising both 

trucks and vans, to monitor the driving behaviour of its drivers. 

This device, which taps on Global Positioning System (GPS) 

tracks the vehicles to ensure that they do not deviate from 

official routes, and helps detect poor driving habits. Data is 

then collected and reports are assessed through an application.



Our scheduled buses come with speed limit devices that prevent 

them from accelerating beyond 60kmh. Similarly, the Mobile Data 

Terminal in our taxis comes with speed alerts that prompt our 

drivers to slow down when they have exceeded the speed limit. 

To better manage and control visitors’ entry into its premises, SBS 

Transit, which rolled out an online electronic visitor management 

system at its bus depots in April 2016, also rolled out the same 

system at all its train depots and stations in 2018.

As for surveillance on board our vehicles, nearly all our public 

transport service vehicles in Singapore have CCTVs or in-vehicle 

cameras. In the UK, all Metroline buses are equipped with 

CCTVs. Down Under, all Swan taxis have in-vehicle cameras, 

while 90% of the public transport service of CDC is equipped 

with this capability.

HEALTH &amp; SAFETY





RECOGNITION

A number of our BUs in Singapore has obtained the 

Occupational Health and Safety Advisory Services (OHSAS) 

18001:2007 and bizSAFE certifications. These include  

ComfortDelGro Bus, ComfortDelGro Engineering, Moove Media, 

SBS Transit’s NEL as well as VICOM. 

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND INITIATIVES

While the importance of safe driving cannot be emphasised 

enough, passengers and other road users also have a role to play 

in ensuring safety standards are adhered to. 

In Singapore, the Group, through ComfortDelGro Driving Centre 

and SBS Transit, engaged the community through several road 

safety talks throughout the year. ComfortDelGro Driving Centre 

collaborated with the Traffic Police in the Road Safety Park initiative 

to conduct over 620 hours of road safety talks and reached out to 

about 30,200 Primary School students. SBS Transit, on the other 

hand, conducted 78 school assembly talks and visits to our bus 

and train premises and reached out to 29,275 students. 

Apart from engaging schools, ComfortDelGro Driving Centre also 

partnered Borneo Motors Singapore to provide complimentary 

half-day Drive Safe Course to new Toyota vehicle owners. Existing 

Toyota vehicle owners can attend the same course through Toyota’s 

loyalty programme. About 30 Toyota vehicle owners completed the 

Drive Safe Course in January 2019, with more owners scheduled 

to undergo it during the year.

This partnership is part of the “Start Your Impossible” global initiative 

launched on 28 September 2018 by Borneo Motors Singapore and 

Toyota Motor Asia Pacific to mark the manufacturer’s commitment 

and support towards the creation of a more inclusive, sustainable 

and mobile society. Under this initiative, celebrated local athlete, 

Mr Joseph Schooling, will be supporting the promotion of 

ComfortDelGro Driving Centre’s Drive Safe Course. 

For SBS Transit, safety campaigns were carried out at a number 

of stations of the NEL and DTL to remind elderly commuters to 

travel safely on escalators. 

To reduce slips, trips and falls on board their buses, CDC buses in 

Sydney and Melbourne had stickers designed to remind customers of 

the importance of safety on the upper decks of double deck buses. 

In Perth, Swan Taxis’ Colour Taxis Scheme, which was rolled out in 

2016 was so well-received that it went on to launch the Pink Taxis 

WA service in Northbridge and the Central Business District in June 

2018. These strikingly pink taxis are driven by female drivers for 

women and families who may feel unsafe travelling in taxis driven 

by male drivers. To-date, 11 such pink taxis are catering to this need. 

In 2018, ComfortDelGro Bus received the Champion Award in the 

“Non-public Bus Fleet” category by the Singapore Road Safety 

Council at the Singapore Road Safety Awards Fundraising Gala 

Dinner. Two ComfortDelGro taxi drivers and one SBS Transit 

BC were also awarded in the “Safe Driver” and “Most Improved 

Driver” categories for their good driving record and safe driving 

behaviour at the same event. 

On 18 December 2018, CDC in NSW attained ISO 55001 for 

Asset Management and ISO 45001 for Occupational Health and 

Safety Management Systems. The internationally recognised 

accreditations underscore CDC’s commitment towards maintaining 

key assets and safety management system to a high standard.

SUPPLY

CHAIN

OUR SUPPLIERS

Our suppliers are our partners. Without the goods and services 

they provide, we would not be able to run our businesses. Working 

closely with them, we explore ways to increase efficiency and 

productivity through the procurement of supplies and services 

which help improve our processes and grow our businesses. We 

are committed to treating our suppliers fairly, and with respect. 

We pay our bills on time, every time and are transparent in all 

our contracts and negotiations. 

OUR PURCHASES

Energy and direct material &amp; services used for the operation and 

maintenance of our fleets form majority of our purchases. In 

2018, we purchased over 1,500 hybrid taxis and fully electric taxis.

About 90% of our spend is with 38 suppliers, of which 35 of 

them have worked with us for more than five years. We have 

long-term contracts of three years or more with 203 suppliers.

EqUAL OPPORTUNITY

We believe in full transparency and according equal treatment to 

all existing/prospective suppliers. Our team regularly conducts 

market insight exercises and encourages tender participation 

from different industry players. In 2018, at least 300 companies 

participated in our tenders for the first time.

Businesses have an equal opportunity to submit their bids for 

any contract through our sourcing platform which has built-in 

functions to safeguard the confidentiality of submitted bids.

Specifications are written to allow bidders the freedom to best 

meet the requirements of the tender and to foster supplier 

interest and encourage innovation.

SUPPLIER SELECTION

We select our suppliers based on multiple criteria, including but 

not limited to the supplier’s technical capabilities, service quality, 

supply assurance, environmental responsibility, safety records, 

financial stability and cost competitiveness. A structured decision 

matrix approach is used with assigned weightage that reflects 

the relative importance of each selection criterion.

Suppliers are also given a “Supplier Ethics Policy” (refer to pages 

26 to 27) which clearly articulates what is required of them in 

terms of fair practice, ethical conduct, as well as social and 

environmental responsibility. From February 2018, this Supplier 

Ethics Policy is embedded in all tender documents. We refrain 

from dealing with Suppliers who are unable to comply with 

our policy.

All recommendations for award are approved in accordance to 

the financial authority limits delegated by the ComfortDelGro 

Board.

RISKS IDENTIFICATION AND MITIGATION

Fraud and Corruption Risk

All officers administering and approving contracts in which they 

or their close relatives have significant interests are required to 

declare and recuse themselves from handling these contracts. 

Staff in the procurement and purchasing team make a declaration 

on conflict of interest annually. All members of the Procurement 

Category team are to attend a workshop on “Procurement Fraud 

Prevention &amp; Detection” within their first two years of service. 

The workshop equipped our staff on effective internal controls 

within the procurement process, as well as the prevention and 

detection of procurement fraud.

OBjECTIVE OF THE “PROCUREMENT FRAUD 

PREVENTION &amp; DETECTION” WORKSHOP

Sustainability Report 2018

*Data available for Singapore only.

About 68% of the contracts by value were established through 

competitive sourcing exercises, including 49% through public 

tenders. The rest of the contracts were established with suppliers 

who are sole source, or incumbents with whom we leveraged 

existing contract volumes. 

Supply Risk

For key purchase categories, the award strategy often includes 

multiple suppliers from different geographical locations. Where 

multiple suppliers are not feasible due to various reasons, the 

Business Continuity Plan of the sole supplier is scrutinised and 

assessed.

Legal Risk

More than 95% of our contracts with suppliers apply one of 

our four Standard Terms &amp; Conditions. These contracts contain 

insurance and limitations of liability clauses. Where supplier’s 

contracts are used, we engage our lawyers to vet through the 

terms to ensure that they are fair and reasonable.

Price Risk

Where product prices are driven by the volatile commodity 

prices, an indexed formula is used. This allows our Treasury 

Department to mitigate cost fluctuation through hedging.

Environmental, Health and Safety Risk

Depending on the nature of purchases, safety rules detailing 

Environmental, Health and Safety requirements are included in 

tender documents. Suppliers are required to undertake to comply 

with the rules. For complex projects, suppliers are required to 

complete a risk assessment before commencing work.

SUPPLIER ONBOARDING

Suppliers seeking to provide goods and/or services to  

ComfortDelGro are required to complete a Supplier Profile 

Questionnaire which provides us with information about their 

company, experiences, track records, financial status, quality 

management system and compliance to local and international 

standards. This enables us to assess the risks of buying from 

the supplier.

SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT

We ensure that our suppliers’ performance meets the expectations 

defined in the contract and against market norms through our 

Supplier Performance Management exercise. Our key suppliers 

undergo regular appraisals to ensure costs are kept in check, 

service standards are kept high and risks are mitigated. The 

ultimate intent is to identify potential issues and their root causes 

so that they can be resolved as quickly as possible.

We highlighted areas of strengths and weaknesses to the 

suppliers and followed up with action plans to improve on areas 

where they did not fare as well. Ten suppliers scored very well 

and have since been included into our preferred suppliers list 

for future contracts.

ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited

OUR STAKEHOLDERS

AND PARTNERS

ComfortDelGro is guided by the principle of creating 

sustainable value for its Stakeholders – be they Customers, 

Shareholders, Employees, Partners or Regulators. 

[GRI102-40]

Key Stakeholders are identified as part of the Risk 

Management process, based on the extent in which 

they can affect or are affected by the operations of the 

Group. [GRI102-42]

Given the significant roles they play, ComfortDelGro 

reaches out actively to key Stakeholders through various 

channels. 

CUSTOMERS

Good customer service is a fundamental aspect of our business. 

In fostering a customer-centric culture, a “customer first” 

mindset permeates through the Group and a robust customer 

engagement process is adopted. 

To this end, employees are equipped with the necessary skills and 

knowledge to provide customers with a best-in-class experience. 

Courses that are conducted include technical training courses 

like “Scania Optimise Programme” and “WSQ Perform Basic 

Maintenance of Bus Engine System” as well as service-centric 

training like “WSQ Project a Positive and Professional Image” 

and “WSQ Project Go-the-Extra-Mile Service”.

Frontline staff in all our businesses actively engage customers 

through various means including outreach programmes where 

potential and existing customers are invited to visit our operations 

once every few months. We also reach out to our customers 

through information counters, hotlines, as well as monthly 

Meet-the-Managers sessions. 

Customers are encouraged to send us their feedback through 

customer questionnaires, online feedback forms or via our 

fully-manned service hotlines. Other than product and service 

enquiries, the key areas of concern amongst customers are 

safety, accessibility and the overall service experience. 

SHAREHOLDERS

We are committed to disseminating accurate and pertinent 

information to the market in a timely manner as part of good  

Corporate Governance. Our Investor Relations (IR) programme  

balances regular, effective and fair communications with 

Shareholders and the investment community with the need 

to safeguard commercial sensitivities. The IR team works 

closely with Senior Management to proactively carry out this  

engagement programme. Feedback and views gathered are  

regularly reported to Senior Management and the Board of  

Directors.

During the year, the IR team met some 330 groups of investors, 

analysts and equity sales personnel over 170 meetings. The team 

also addressed queries from investors through emails, telephone 

calls and the online enquiry form.

Besides face-to-face office meetings and conference calls, we 

also participated in eight investor conferences and non-deal road-

shows in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei. 

These platforms provide direct access to a wide cross-section of 

existing and new institutional investors from around the world. To 

reach out to retail investors in Singapore, an investor presentation 

was held at the SGX auditorium.

We organised face-to-face briefings for the media and sell-side 

analysts for the full-year results and conducted dial-in conference 

calls with sell-side analysts for the other quarterly results. Three 

post-results luncheons were organised where we met fund 

managers based in Singapore after the full-year FY2017 results 

and the second and third quarter results for FY2018.

ComfortDelGro attracts active research coverage from sell-side 

analysts and the stock is now covered by 15 local and international 

research houses. Some 190 reports on the Company and the 

industry were published during the year. The IR team has regular 

interactions with the analysts to ensure a thorough understanding 

of our business models and strategies, operations and financial 

performance and growth opportunities.

EMPLOYEES

With a global workforce of close to 24,700, employee engagement 

is a critical aspect of our human resource management. 

Talent management and succession planning rank high on 

ComfortDelGro’s priority list. 

Through regular employee engagement programmes including 

seminars, training courses, quarterly newsletters and weekly 

dialogue sessions, we are able to encourage critical thinking 

and innovation, build team spirit and groom the next generation 

of leaders. 

Managers are empowered and encouraged to hold regular 

feedback sessions with their subordinates. The annual appraisal 

performance session serves as a platform for employees to 

discuss their work performance and map out their career 

progression. Common issues raised by employees include 

training and remuneration. 

More information can be found on pages 30 to 37. 

PARTNERS AND SUPPLIERS 

We work closely with our partners and suppliers to ensure the 

smooth delivery of our services. We recognise our dependency 

on the timely delivery of key parts and components and the 

quality of our subcontractors. This is a key risk which we have 

identified and which we manage diligently. We also have in place 

detailed Risk Management contingency plans where needed. 

More information can be found in the  ComfortDelGro Annual 

Report 2018.

As a responsible corporate citizen, we also strongly believe 

in ensuring compliance in all our operations and businesses. 

We do not condone any corrupt practices or anti-competitive 

behaviour. We have a strict procurement policy which, among 

other things, conducts supplier assessment to ensure there is 

no adverse impact on society. Among other things, suppliers 

are required to have strict environmental policies, adopt fair 

employment practices, have clear health and safety policies, 

and adhere to strict anti-corruption policies.

For example, Business Units (BUs) such as ComfortDelGro Taxi 

engages its partners such as its cabbies about twice a month 

and once a week or a quarter with its suppliers. Similarly, SBS 

Transit engages its contractors regularly about various safety 

issues and through its annual Safety &amp; Health Programme &amp; 

Education (SHAPE).

More information can be found on pages 24 to 27.

REGULATORS

ComfortDelGro is firmly committed to complying with all legal 

and regulatory requirements.

As the provision of public land transport services is highly 

regulated, the Group, through our various BUs, holds regular 

weekly dialogue sessions with the various Regulators including 

the Land Transport Authority, the SGX, the National Environment 

Agency and the Ministry of Manpower.

A range of topics are discussed at such meetings, including 

unfolding trends, new technologies, safety, competition, 

environmental and accessibility issues. 

Where Regulators seek consultation in reviewing existing and 

emerging policies, we are responsive and strive to provide 

constructive feedback.

Sustainability Report 2018

DIVERSITY AND EqUAL OPPORTUNITIES

In 2018, the ComfortDelGro Group employed 24,697 employees, 

representing an increase of 12.7% or 2,779 staff over the 

previous year. The increase generally came from acquisitions 

and business growth. 

Operating in seven countries, our workforce varies in size 

according to our business needs. In Singapore, which is our 

Headquarters (HQ), our staff strength in 2018 was 13,823. In the 

United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland, it was a total of 6,113 while 

in Australia, it was 3,805. In China, we had 815 staff, followed 

by Vietnam with 101 and Malaysia with 40.    

We believe that diversity in the workplace is fundamental to 

growth and professional development. It benefits both the 

individual and the Corporation as it brings new perspectives 

to the way we work and operate through different ideas, skills 

and attitudes. A diversified workforce – whether in terms of 

gender, race or nationality – also means that we have access 

to the widest talent pools.   

Starting at the Board level, three out of our 11 Board Directors 

are women. Female representation on our Board has been 

increasing over the past two years. From just one since 2007, 

we have appointed two more female Directors – one in 2018 

and another in 2019 – bringing the female representation on 

our Board to 27%. This also exceeds the target of 20% by 2020 

set by the Council for Board Diversity whose patron is the 

President of the Republic of Singapore.

In our businesses, which are traditionally male-dominated, 87% 

of our employees are males. However, the number of female 

employees has been on the rise. In 2018, the number of female 

staff increased by 135 or 4.4% compared to the year before. This 

was partly due to recruitment initiatives to encourage female 

employees to join/re-join the workforce and the shift in cultural 

norms and gender paradigms. 

With land transport being an essential means for the population to 

get around, our businesses are generally not affected by seasonal 

demand. Hence, in 2018, on a global average, slightly more than 

91% of our people were engaged on permanent contracts with 

87.7% of them being males. Close to 94% continued to hold 

full-time positions, of which 87.5% were males. 

Our employees’ ages range from below 30 years old to over 70 

years old. Despite their age differences, they work together and 

learn from each other. While we value the young for the spark 

and ingenuity they bring to the workplace, older workers are, 

and continue to be, a valued part of our workforce. They tend to 

be mature, reliable and bring a wealth of experience with them. 

In 2018, one in every two of our employees was between 30 

and 50 years old. Those over 50 years old made up 36.7% of our 

global workforce while the under 30s was 12%. This age profile 

is not significantly different from those of 2017.   

As a global Group, we have a broad mix of nationalities among 

our staff, with Singaporeans accounting for the majority at 29.3%. 

The other nationalities include Malaysians (20.8%), Australians 

(15.4%), British (9.7%), Chinese (7%), Vietnamese (0.4%) and Irish 

(0.2%). We also have a small representation of other nationalities 

accounting for about 17.2% in all. This includes the Indians, 

Pakistanis, Polish and Romanians.

In spite of our diversity, we have an all-inclusive work culture, 

where people of different age groups, ethnicities and genders 

work together in harmony. To this end, we provide equal 

opportunities to our staff, and ensure that all terms and conditions 

of employment, along with policies and procedures, comply with 

relevant regulations and strict human rights and labour practices. 

We implement our guiding principles in a non-discriminatory 

manner, paying particular attention to the rights and needs of, 

as well as the challenges faced by individuals who may be at 

heightened risk of becoming vulnerable or marginalised. We 

believe that regardless of age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, 

disability, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, 

religion, or affiliation to any political party or trade union, all our 

staff should be treated equitably and given fair opportunities to 

grow and develop in accordance to their levels of competence. 

In Singapore, as a member of the Tripartite Alliance of Fair and 

Progressive Employment Practices, a national agency helmed by 

the Singapore National Employers Federation and the National 

Trades Union Congress, we have pledged our committment 

to adhere to fair employment practices. We adhere to the five 

key principles of fair employment practices – recruiting and 

selecting employees on the basis of merit, treating them fairly 

and with respect, providing them with equal opportunities for 

training and development, rewarding them based on their ability, 

performance, and contribution and abiding by labour laws and 

the Tripartite Guidelines.

In employee recruitment, our advertisements do not state age, 

race, gender or religion as preferences or requirements.  

At the workplace, we strongly subscribe to zero tolerance for 

discrimination where employees are selected based on competence 

and merit. Employees who feel discriminated against can lodge 




32

ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited

OUR PEOPLE

a report to the Management, Union or the Authorities in charge of 

employment matters in the different countries that we operate in. 

In 2018, there were six reports of discrimination filed with the 

Employment Tribunal against UK’s Metroline. One case has been 

withdrawn and the other five cases are scheduled for a hearing 

by the Tribunal in 2019.      

For ComfortDelGro Corporation Australia in New South Wales 

(CDC NSW), the Anti-discrimination Board concluded in 2018 

that no action would be taken against the Company concerning 

the outstanding case of 2017 where a staff reported that he was 

bullied and harassed by colleagues at the workplace. 

GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT

To sustain our business needs, we continued to recruit staff to cater 

to expansion in operations as well as fill vacancies due to attrition. 

In 2018, we recruited 4,219 employees with 56.6% of them for 

our Singapore businesses and 25.5% for our UK operations. These 

new staff comprised 17.1% of our total workforce and with 86.3% 

being male employees. 

For the same period, 3,543 staff or 14.3% left the Company.  Of this, 

32.3% were due to staff reaching their retirement age, completing 

their employment contracts, being subject to disciplinary proceedings 

or other reasons. Those who left our employment voluntarily 

formed 9.7% of our staff strength.  

Our absenteeism rate for 2018 was 2%, similar to 2017.  

As a Group we believe that our people are at the heart of our success. 

Be it new or experienced employees, we invest continually in them 

to develop their skills and talent. We ensure that they understand 

their responsibilities and are given access to necessary training to 

equip them to do their jobs better.

For non-executive staff, training is structured to cater to operational 

needs where the subjects cover technical aspects, safety and 

soft skills. These include Class 4 and 5 driving, defensive driving, 

preventive maintenance, report writing and customer service training. 

For instance, in China’s Guangzhou Xin Tian Wei Development 

Transportation Company, staff attended “Automated Equipment 

Safety Training” and “Service Standards and Etiquette” classes.   

Executive staff attend training sessions which are aimed at 

enhancing their functional knowledge as well as skills in finance, 

decision-making, leadership and people management. They also 

attend training to implement regulatory and key management 

programmes such as Occupational Health and Safety, Business 

Continuity Planning and Enterprise Risk Management. For instance, 

executives in CDC Victoria attended a “Managing Through Change” 

training programme while those in SBS Transit attended a course 

on “The Five Levels of Leadership and the 360-Degree Leader”. 

In 2018, our employees across the Group averaged 33.8 hours 

of training, which is about 6 hours or 20.7% more than in 2017. 

Male employees clocked in slightly more than 35 hours of training 

while female employees attended 25 hours of training on average. 

Executives clocked in 32.7 hours of training while non-executives 

attended close to 34 hours of training on average.   

As part of staff development, all employees receive performance 

and career development reviews at least once a year. We practise 

an open system in our employee appraisals where the supervisor 

conducts a review with the staff based on his/her performance.  

Employees are assessed on their competency and contributions 

while executive level staff are also measured on their achievement 

of their key performance tasks and targets.   

 

As part of our rigorous process, to ensure a steady pipeline of 

quality management staff, our high-performing staff are subject 

to a Promotion Board to assess their general management, people 

and leadership attributes. Besides the psychometric tools used for 

recruitment, senior Business Unit (BU) Heads and Group Officers 

are also actively involved in the assessment and recruitment of 

high potentials.  

We also have in place various programmes and processes that focus 

on key areas, including building management bench strength, talent 

management, succession planning, performance management 

and compensation and benefits.  

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT

We believe that engaged employees are motivated to do better. 

For this reason, ComfortDelGro actively engages its employees 

through various platforms and avenues.

At the start of every year, at our Corporate HQ, our Chairman 

and Managing Director/Group Chief Executive Officer (MD/

Group CEO) meet Senior Management at a breakfast meeting 

where they lay out the challenges that are expected in the 

months ahead. Action plans and strategies are also discussed 

at this annual meeting which is also attended by the Heads of 

the overseas BUs, where possible.  

Our MD/Group CEO personally meet up with employees as part 

of his broader staff engagement efforts. In 2018, engagement 

sessions continued to be held with specialist staff, employees from 

the BUs and union representatives. This allowed Management 

to better understand the workplace challenges, identify areas 

for improvement, and, also appreciate the contributions of 

our employees. 

On a regular basis, briefing sessions, dialogues and conferences 

are organised by Management to share information and align 

business goals and objectives with employees and for employees 

to share concerns and make suggestions. New hires attend 

an induction programme to orientate them to our culture, 

values and businesses.   

Besides dialogues and sharing of information, we also believe 

in recognising staff for their contributions. Long Service Awards 

are presented to staff in recognition of their faithful years of 

service to the Company. For example, our Bus and Taxi BUs 

in Australia hand out awards to staff who have served for 

between five and 35 years.  


33

Sustainability Report 2018

On a global level, ComfortDelGro also recognises employees 

who go beyond their call of duty to carry out their jobs. It 

has been conferring the annual Passion Award on deserving 

employees since 2008 with past winners coming from the 

UK, Australia, China and Singapore. The winner is invited to 

Singapore to receive the award and also given a S$5,000 

cash prize with an all expenses paid trip to one of the 

seven countries we operate in – depending on where the 

winner hails from.

In 2018, Mr Deng Ziliang, a Service Controller with SBS 

Transit, was the winner. Driven by passion in his job, he 

had responded to the call for help on his rest day when the 

MRT line was disrupted due to a flooding incident. Although 

it was not in his job scope, he rushed down to the scene 

and led the convoy of bridging buses, whose Bus Captains 

were unfamiliar with the shuttle routes, to assist affected 

commuters in continuing with their journeys.    



Apart from this, employees who provide quality service 

to customers receive recognition for their good efforts. 

Internal awards include the Employee of the Month and CEO 

commendation awards which are held either on a quarterly 

or annual basis by the different BUs.  

Our employees also receive prestigious external awards for their 

outstanding contributions. In 2018, 11 staff from our Singapore 

BUs – ComfortDelGro Engineering, ComfortDelGro Taxi and SBS 

Transit – received the Outstanding Award from the President of the 

Republic of Singapore at the National Kindness Award – Transport  

Gold ceremony. At the UK Coach Awards, Mr Peter Knight,  

Operations Director of Scottish Citylink Coaches, received the 

“Young Coach Industry Professional Award” and Mr Jim Orr, 

a Despatch Controller, won the gold award in the “Unsung 

Heroes” category.  

Three cabbies – Mr Huang Zhi Jun, Mr Zhong Wei and Mr He 

Mao Xue – from Chengdu ComfortDelGro Taxi were recognised 

as outstanding cabbies by the City Transport Bureau and the 

National Taxi Association. Ten other cabbies from Nanning 

Comfort Transportation also made us proud when they were 

presented with the “Courteous Role Model Award” by Nanning 

Taxi Association for their good service and excellent driving 

record.

More than just work, we also seek to create a positive environment 

for our people where they can have fun and de-stress. We 

believe that having healthy employees is important to our 

productivity. Hence, we actively promote a healthy lifestyle 

through activities such as bowling competitions, cross-country 

runs, yoga, Zumba, brisk walking and jogging sessions. In 2018, 

the Group organised a charity cross-country run and leisure 

walk which drew the participation of 930 local staff. Together 

they clocked about 2,500km and donated 12,240 bowls of 

rice to needy families.  

 

LABOUR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS  

ComfortDelGro believes in developing and sustaining a harmonious 

tripartite labour-management relationship. In fact, labour relations is 

a key function of daily life in the organisation.  Globally, 80% of our 

staff across our businesses are covered by Collective Agreements.

Working hand-in-hand in the spirit of mutual respect and trust, 

Management and Union constantly collaborate to improve the 

welfare and well-being of employees. To ensure that communication 

channels are always kept open, employees are elected and appointed 

as Union representatives by union members to provide the crucial 

link between Management and Union.  

In 2018, our Singapore businesses continued to honour the 

Collective Agreements signed in 2017 for a three-year period. When 

there are major changes to working conditions that may affect the 

well-being of employees due to operational requirements, the 

changes to be effected are always first discussed with the Union. 

It is only when an agreement or a consensus is reached that the 

changes are announced for implementation. A reasonable time 

frame of between one and three months’ notice is typically given 

to the affected staff and are communicated officially in writing 

through letters, circulars or emails. Briefing sessions are organised 

to communicate any changes where needed.

OUT

At ComfortDelGro, community engagement is not 

just a catchphrase. It is an integral part of our moral 

fabric – closely intertwined with everything that we do. 

Our guiding principle is simple: Pursue benefits for 

both the business and the society concurrently. This 

two-pronged approach involves us finding ways to 

develop our business whilst creating a sustainable 

environment. In all that we do, we are constantly 

looking at ways in which we can help the communities 

we operate in to grow – in tandem with our businesses.

We believe that business should not just be governed 

by the mind – but the heart and soul as well. 

In our business, moving people between destinations is 

central to everything we do. We are continually looking 

at new and better ways to do this – and to find ways 

to reach out to an even wider range of commuters.  

The nature of our business involves community 

engagement in most of our operations. Nearly all of 

our operations have implemented local community 

engagement or development programmes.

ACCESSIBILITY

As a provider of land transport services, accessibility is a critical part 

of our business focus. We are committed to providing our services 

equitably to serve all customers – independent of age or ability. 

To this end, we have invested substantially in wheelchair-friendly 

buses that are capable of transporting persons-in-wheelchairs 

(PIWs) safely and comfortably. 

In Singapore, the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia, drivers of 

our wheelchair-friendly bus services are trained in the correct 

way to deploy the ramps and assist the passengers. In the UK 

and Scotland, all of Metroline bus services and Scottish Citylink 

Coaches are wheelchair accessible, while 98% of our buses 

operated by SBS Transit in Singapore, 82% of New Adventure 

Travel (NAT) Group’s coaches and 67% of our buses operated 

by ComfortDelGro Corporation Australia (CDC) in Australia are 

wheelchair accessible.

To better serve the visually-impaired and the hearing-impaired 

commuters, SBS Transit is supporting the Land Transport 

Authority in a six-month trial in which assistive technologies are 

employed to make it easier for them to travel on public buses. 

Audio announcements are also available at bus stops to allow 

visually-impaired commuters to hear the approaching service 

number, and when they are on board the bus, hear the next 

stop destination. Audio announcements are transmitted to the 

hearing-impaired via special hearing aids. Bus Captains are also 

alerted to commuters with special needs at the bus stop ahead 

through a display unit.

Apart from our buses, our taxis are also disabled-friendly.

Our taxi drivers are trained to assist PIWs in the correct way. 

We continue to reach out to the disabled by giving them free 

or subsidised rides.

In Singapore, ComfortDelGro Taxi has been providing subsidised 

rides to members of the Handicaps Welfare Association under 

the Handicare Cab Scheme since 1999. To-date, we have 

subsidised a total of 69,260 trips worth close to S$400,000. 

The Company also waived the current booking fee up to 

three times a day for all guide dog handlers. SBS Transit 

also worked with the Guide Dogs Association of Singapore 

to produce an educational video for the public on what to 

expect when they encounter visually-impaired commuters 

travelling with guide dogs.

In Western Australia (WA), Swan Taxis, a strong advocate of 

Guide Dogs WA had raised funds through its annual Charity 

Car Wash to co-sponsor Skipper the trainee guide dog in 

2018. It also raised another A$15,000 (S$15,124.50) for the 

adoption of Harvey, a second guide dog under training. 

CabbyCare Charity Group (CabbyCare), our Taxi Business’ 

cabby volunteer group, sponsored taxi vouchers to various 

individuals and organisations such as the Singapore Association 

of the Visually Handicapped as well as made over 150 free trips 

for the Children’s Cancer Foundation’s Wishlink Foundation, 

the Kidney Dialysis Foundation, St Hilda’s Community Services 

Centre, and Singapore General Hospital’s Amputees Support 

Group as they went on their community outings.




39

Sustainability Report 2018

In China, we not only gave the disabled free rides on Disability 

Day, but through Nanjing ComfortDelGro Dajian Taxi and Shanghai 

City Qi Ai Taxi Services, also contributed a total of RMB419,000 

(S$85,517.90) to the Employment Fund for the Handicapped. 

As the only driving school approved by the Authorities to train 

disabled students since 2010, Chengdu ComfortDelGro Qing 

Yang Driving School trained 24 such students in 2018, bringing 

the total to 584 to-date. Our driving centre in Singapore, on 

the other hand, waived the membership fee of private driving 

instructors who train handicapped learner drivers.

LOCAL COMMUNITIES

ComfortDelGro is committed to community contribution 

in all geographies that we operate in. We actively reach out 

in various areas including education, welfare, disaster relief 

and health. 

For 2018, the Group continued to care for the poor, the 

elderly and the sick, donating over S$1.15 million to various 

charities and welfare organisations. 

Serving the Elderly Poor and Supporting the Needy

We have, since 2005, been contributing to NTUC Eldercare, 

which provides social day care services to the elderly poor. To-

date, we have contributed a total of S$1.85 million to this cause. 

We have also been partnering the Lions Befrienders Service 

Association (Singapore) (Lions Befrienders) to reach out to the 

elderly poor seniors. 2018 was the ninth year of the second 

five-year cycle partnership that we have with Lions Befrienders. 

During the year, we continued to help improve the living conditions 

of the seniors through the Home Improvement Programme 

(HIP) Fund by purchasing new electrical appliances as well as 

replacing old furniture with new ones. In 2018, S$26,500 was 

used to purchase these items. In all, over S$256,300 has been 

used to-date. 

To give the Lions Befrienders seniors a break from their usual 

routine, ComfortDelGro staff brought them on all-expenses paid 

excursions in 2018, including a trishaw ride in July, a Singapore 

Chinese Orchestra concert in November and a shopping spree 

at a hypermart in December. Moove Media contributed goodie 

bags for the seniors and volunteers for these activities.

In May 2018, ComfortDelGro Rent-A-Car delivered packages 

consisting of basic necessities, including rice, oil, canned food, 

tissue paper and soap to 47 Lions Befrienders seniors. 

VICOM celebrated Chinese New Year with seniors from the 

Thye Hwa Kwan@Indus and also celebrated the Mid-Autumn 

Festival with seniors from the Thong Kheng Seniors Activity 

Centre by spending some joy time with them at the Gardens 

by the Bay in October 2018.

Moove Media’s subsidiary, GobblerCo, continued to support 

the elderly, disabled and low-income individuals or families by 

distributing food and essential items. In April 2018, GobblerCo 

organised its first “Gift It Forward” donation drive in conjunction 

with its super sale. This donation drive raised almost S$2,000 

worth of groceries for 600 families. Similarly, its second “Gift It 

Forward” donation drive raised about S$3,000 worth of groceries 

for 600 needy families.

It also continued to empower the needy by helping them become 

their own “bosses” through its “TOWKAY” programme that was 

launched in September 2016.

A S$150,000-GIFT FROM COMFORTDELGRO 

TO NEEDY SENIORS 

In July 2018, the Group gifted S$150,000 to three voluntary 

welfare organisations, which included a refurbished nine-

seater ComfortDelGro bus with a hydraulic lifter to Blossom 

Seeds, and S$100,000 worth of free medi trips for Dorcas 

Home Care Service and Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society’s 

medical escort and transport service for their needy elderly 

patients. In 2018, a total of 645 medi trips, worth S$35,475 

in fares, were made.

REACHING OUT

ENGAGING THE YOUTH THROUGH ANTI-

GRAFFITI WORKSHOPS

CDC continued to collaborate with the Western Bulldogs’ 

popular youth leadership programme to conduct anti-

graffiti workshops for 119 students so as to clamp down 

on vandalism. During these sessions, youths aged between 

14 and 16 smeared and removed graffiti from a bus so that 

they could better understand how painstaking and costly 

the entire cleaning process was.



To support needy families residing in the South East District, over 50 

ComfortDelGro Taxi staff participated in the 3M Step Up Challenge 

and clocked 15,000 minutes in a Zumba Fitness Programme in 

exchange for 500 safety and household items, while about 930 

ComfortDelGro Group staff walked a total of 2,448 kilometres 

under the ‘Walk for Rice’ initiative to raise 12,240 bowls of white 

and brown rice for the needy families. 

CabbyCare continues to deliver meals, bread and library books to 

the needy for free. In 2018, it was estimated that CabbyCare made 

over 3,140 trips and the fares forfeited from these three-hour trips 

amount to about S$235,500. On Christmas Day, ComfortDelGro 

Taxi collected call levies of completed taxi booking jobs and 

donated close to S$30,000 to CabbyCare so that it could continue 

to provide free trips. 

During the year, SBS Transit continued to offer free travel on the North 

East Line to the elderly residents of the Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital 

when they went on their excursions. The Group’s engineering arm, 

ComfortDelGro Engineering, continued to provide maintenance 

services at subsidised rates to charitable organisations under the 

National Council of Social Services. 

In Wales, the New Adventure Travel Group, one of ComfortDelGro’s 

newest acquisitions in 2018, sponsored coach travel for a choir 

that originated from a poor town in Croatia to an event organised 

by its regular client, the Cwmbach Male Voice Choir, an all-male 

seniors choir established since 1921. It also continued to provide 

free bus services for the Ynysybwl Village’s annual music festival 

in Cwm Clydach. 

In Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam Taxi (Vinataxi) continued to sponsor 

the Lawrence S Ting Charity Walk that supports the poor and needy 

in Districts 7, 8, Bình Chánh and Nhà Bè.

Engaging the Young

Apart from the elderly poor, children are very much on our minds too.

In Australia, CDC donated to schools in Sydney for their awards, 

while in Melbourne, it pledged A$14,570 (S$14,690.93) towards 

providing students from Melbourne’s West with stored value or 

MYKI cards for travel on buses, trains and trams.

In the UK, Metroline apprentices helped strip and refurbish an old 

bus that was no longer fit for revenue service into a stationary 

library and donated it to a school to help encourage students to 

read in a more fun and exciting environment. 

Our taxi companies in China also continued to provide free taxi 

trips to needy students during the country’s National Education 

Entrance Examination.  

In Vietnam, Vinataxi sponsored 100 million VND (S$5,862) towards 

the tenth Phu My Hung Children’s Day event, which provided 12,000 

children in Ho Chi Minh City with a day of fun, food and games.

Caring for the Sick

Our businesses are also firm supporters of non-profit organisations 

that look after the sick and the terminally-ill. 

In Singapore, ComfortDelGro Taxi and CabbyCare participated 

in the Children’s Cancer Foundation’s (CCF) Hair for Hope for 

the fifth year. A total of S$12,000 was donated to CCF by both 

ComfortDelGro Taxi and CabbyCare, bringing the contribution 

to S$152,000 since CabbyCare started participating in Hair for 

Hope in 2014.  

In addition, ComfortDelGro Taxi and CabbyCare, together with 

Madam Lim Choo Eng, wife of the late ComfortDelGro Cabby 

Cheng Teck Hock, forked out a combined total of S$72,000 to 

sponsor three new haemodiafiltration machines to the Kidney 

Dialysis Foundation.

VICOM continued their outreach to Star PALS, a palliative home care 

service for children and youth with life-threatening or life-limiting 

conditions, through donation boxes placed in its seven inspection 

centres. It also organised a workshop for 40 underprivileged children 

from Star PALs in December 2018 and gifted them vouchers as 

part of their goodie bags.  

Elsewhere, our businesses continued their support towards various 

medical care and research establishments in cash or in kind. In the 

UK, Metroline opened the doors of Potters Bar Bus Garage and 

Holloway Bus Garage to the public and donated proceeds from 

admission fees towards charities, including those supporting cancer 

researches as well as the British Heart Foundation. 

CityFleet Networks also made donations towards cancer and 

palliative care, while ComfortDelGro Irish Citylink staff sold daffodils 

on Daffodil Day to raise funds for the Irish Cancer Society.

In Australia, Swan Taxis donated over A$7,000 (S$7,058.10) towards 

various medical establishments including the Breast Cancer 

Foundation, Pek Care International, and the Princess Margaret 

Hospital Foundation that supports children undergoing life-

threatening treatments.

Sustainability Report 2018

ComfortDelGro is committed to safeguarding the 

interests of our Stakeholders for sustainable growth, at 

the highest governance level. The Board has reviewed 

and approved the material issues, and has delegated the 

management and monitoring to Senior Management.

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters as 

determined by our Stakeholders and deemed to be material to 

value creation are integrated into our balanced scorecard, which 

is used to set objectives, drive behaviours, measure performance 

and determine remuneration.

We hold ourselves to high standards of corporate governance 

and business and ethical conduct. Our governance policies and 

practices are in line with the principles and guidelines set out 

in the Code of Corporate Governance issued by the Monetary 

Authority of Singapore on 2 May 2012. 

We also have in place a robust Enterprise Risk Management 

Risk Framework which enables our Group and Business Units 

to understand the nature and complexity of the risks involved 

in the operations and provides a systematic process to identify 

and review the risks and prioritise resources to manage them.

OUR APPROACH

TO SUSTAINABILITY

Environmental and social issues rank high on our priority list 

which is why we have incorporated such considerations into 

our decision making processes. For example, we are sensitive 

to the levels of emissions of our vehicles and weigh this against 

costs when renewing our fleets. Safety considerations are also 

included in the performance assessments of our operations 

while our Group-wide Green Committee lead on improvements 

in environmental issues. Our risk-based approach is aligned to 

the precautionary principle. We are a proud signatory to the 

United Nations Global Compact (UNGC).

 

We are equally committed to respecting the privacy of every 

individual and adhering to relevant legislation such as the Personal 

Data Protection Act 2012, Singapore (“PDPA”). We have put in 

place adequate and robust Information Technology (IT) security 

systems and operating processes to ensure data security by 

adopting the ComfortDelGro IT Risk Management Framework. 

The security measures are constantly updated to meet the ever-

changing threat levels. Staff are also reminded of the need to 

adhere to the Act and to be mindful of our customers’ privacy.

More information on risk management can be found on pages 

85 to 87 in the ComfortDelGro Annual Report 2018.
