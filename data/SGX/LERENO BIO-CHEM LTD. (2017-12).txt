SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FOR FINANCIAL YEAR 2017 

 

 

 

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Lereno Bio-Chem Ltd. (the “Company”) wishes to announce 

that the Company will not be providing a sustainability report for the financial year ended 31 

December 2017 (“FY2017”). As the Company is currently a cash company with no operating business, 

the Board is of the view that the preparation of a sustainability report for FY2017 will not be 

meaningful. 

 

Nonetheless, the Board recognises its responsibility in considering sustainability issues as part of its 

strategic formulation and will ensure that the Company reaches out and work with its stakeholders, 

from its employees to the community, and be responsible stewards to the natural environment.  

 

 

By Order of the Board,  

Lereno Bio-Chem Ltd
