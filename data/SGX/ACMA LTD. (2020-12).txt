The Group’s sustainability efforts are led by management who reports directly to the Board. In 

developing the sustainability blueprint, management has sought and taken into consideration 

the views of various stakeholders as part of the process of identifying the material

for providing the strategic direction of the Company after due consideration of the relevant 

sustainability factors.

9. ENVIRONMENT 

 

The Group recognizes a breach of any laws or regulations could have a significant impact on 

production and result in reputational damage. In some cases, non-compliance may also result 

in economic loss for the Group arising, for example, from clean up obligations or other  

costly environmental liabilities. In FY2020, there were no incidences of non-compliance with 

environment laws and regulations which have resulted in any significant fines or sanctions. 

 

We aim to maintain zero incidence of no-compliance with environmental laws and regulations 

in FY2021.

The Board and management are committed to maintaining strong corporate governance and 

risk management practices to help ensure sustainability of the Group’s businesses. Please 

refer to the Corporate Governance Report in the relevant pages of our 2020 Annual Report. 

 

The Group does not tolerate any corruption, impropriety, statutory non-compliance or 

malpractice by staff in the course of their work. Our Whistle-blowing policy is intended to 

provide a framework to promote responsible and secure whistle-blowing without fear of 

adverse consequences. 

 

Employees and external parties including suppliers, customers and other stakeholders may 

use the procedure set out in the policy to report any concern or complaint regarding 

questionable business practices, disclosure matters, conflict of interest, breaches of Group 

policy, fraud, corruption or any other matters of employee misconduct. 

 

There were no confirmed incidents of corruption during FY2020. We aim to continue the 

Group’s existing policies in FY2021 and strive to maintain the zero incidences of confirmed 

corruption.
