LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN / CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 

 

 

Dear Stakeholders, 

 

The Board of Goodland Group Limited and its subsidiaries (“Goodland” or the “Group”) is 

pleased to present Sustainability Report (“Report”) for the financial year ended 30 September 

2020. 

 

We are actively integrating sustainability principles into the business in achieving the mission of 

“Goodland, Good Living”. The Board believes sustainability is essential in business strategy to 

driving long term growth and prosperity for Goodland. 

 

Our effort in taking care of the environment by constantly exploring green technologies and 

methods to reduce water and energy consumption in day-to day operation aim to conserve 

our natural resources. We are also committed to enhance public safety, reduce noise and 

vibration, and power management on site. We pride ourselves in practicing Green and 

Gracious Building Scheme (GGBS) under the Building and Construction Authority of Singapore 

(BCA) in our workplace.  

 

We believe in giving back to the society is part of our responsibility. A business is sustainable if 

we have support from the community.  We continue to make our contribution by making 

donation and taking part in charity activities to non-profit organisations and temples to help 

with the less fortunate. We continue to maintain high standards of corporate governance for 

the benefits of our shareholder.  

 

The global outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has inevitably impacted all trades in Singapore 

and the rest of the world. The Singapore Government has gradually implemented a series of 

measures to reduce and slow the transmission of the virus; and various financing support have 

also been introduced to help Singapore businesses. Necessary safety measurements have 

been implemented at our construction sites, commercial and industrial buildings to ensure the 

wellbeing of our employees, our tenants and visitors to our properties. The Group is actively 

monitoring the impact of the pandemic outbreak. 

 

The Group endeavours to continually improve our sustainability practices as we progress. We 

welcome 

feedback 

from 

our 

stakeholders. 

Please

8.1 

Environmental Factors 

 

The Group is committed to minimising its environmental impact as a real estate owner, 

developer and manager. It believes that lowering the environmental footprint of its 

buildings through innovation creates value for its stakeholders. 

 

The Group incorporates environmental sustainability in our projects, from feasibility, 

design, 

procurement, 

construction, 

operation 

to 

redevelopment. 

Monitoring 

environmental impacts is integral to its business operations, as efficient use of 

environmental resources such as energy and water contributes to the operational 

efficiency and long-term sustainability of the company. 

 

We strive to improve our environmental performance over time and to initiate additional 

projects and activities that will further reduce the impact of the Group’s activities on the 

environment and the public. 

 

Our commitment to the environment extends to our customers, staff and the community 

in which we operate.   We are committed to: 

 minimise or prevent pollution and ensure that working environment is kept clean and  

in good order at all times whenever possible 

 train all staff on our environmental management program and empower them to 

contribute and participate

8.2 

Social Factors 

 

Occupational Health and Safety 

 

Occupational health and safety (OHS) of our staff, tenants, contractors, suppliers and 

the communities who use its properties, is of utmost importance to the Group. Effective 

OHS management is part of risk management and deemed to enhance staff 

productivity and morale.  The Group’s efforts on public safety include the use of proper 

full-height hoarding of the construction site, provision of site safety information and 

sufficient signages to visitors and the use of traffic cones or barriers to raise awareness of 

construction activities 

 

Noise and Vibrations 

 

The Group’s efforts on reducing noise and vibrations includes: 

 

installation of instruments to manage noise and vibration levels 

 

use newer equipment/machinery to achieve lower noise emissions 

 

Supply Chain 

 

Building materials are purchased by contractors. As such, the Group has limited control 

over the type and quantity of materials purchased for the development projects. Instead, 

the scope of disclosure for materials is confined to areas it has operational control: the 

promoting of responsible sourcing practices along the supply chain, and to encourage 

the use of eco-friendly and recycled materials.  For example, we used green products 

that are certified by PSB Singapore for construction, such as Davco Eco-friendly 

waterproofing and plastering, tile adhesive &amp; etc. 

 

Talent Retention  

 

Goodland advocates and invests in the development of employees to fulfil their 

potential and contribute towards the progress of the Group, including the sponsorship 

of degree and diploma programmes. Our employees are encouraged to attend 

conferences and seminars to acquire knowledge to meet their relevant work 

requirements. Goodland conducts In-house training regularly to enhance employee’s 

understanding of the Group’s products and operations and to align staff with the 

Group’s objectives.  

 

During this Covid-19 pandemic, the Group’s business is adversely affected by the 

Government’s restriction orders put in place to control the transmission of the disease. 

The Group has maintained salary pay-out to employees to support them through the 

difficult time. In addition, the Group also supports our employees to apply for 

government subsidy for temporary accommodation for staff living across the border, 

who were affected by the closure of the border implemented by both Singapore and 

Malaysia. 

 

Goodwill Jobs Done for the Community  

 

Goodland is committed to perform jobs to community out of goodwill to encourage a 

good relationship with our neighbourhood, which include: 

 

protecting trees and extension of site boundary and canvas to minimize the pollution  

 

daily housekeeping works to prevent from mosquito breeding 

 

select optimum delivery timing (less traffic flow) for construction materials to be 

delivered to construction site to minimize public inconvenience  

 

provision of repairs and repainting work to affected neighbours

Corporate Social Responsibility 

 

The Group’s social responsibility can be built up through community investments. In the 

longer term, this strengthens the Group’s social licence to operate and ability to deliver 

sustainable value.  We are committed to continually engaging our employees in our 

corporate social responsibility initiatives and efforts. 

 

In giving back to the community, Goodland: 

 

 contributed S$10,000 to Braddell Heights Citizens’ Consultative Committee 

Community Development and Welfare Fund for the “Upgrading Fund-Raising Golf 

Tournament and Dinner 2019” on 4 October 2019. The fund raising was aim to 

upgrade the present 19 year old Braddell Height Community Club building and to 

organise more community events to promote social cohesion and racial harmony 

amongst all races, ages and gender.  

 

 contributed S$5,000 to Relay Majulah, a fundraising run by 200 runners in a relay 

format, passing the baton from one to another, covering 2000km. The event had 

successfully raised a total of S$1.6 million and all donations goes directly to the 67 

charities supported by the President’s Challenge. 

 

 Joined the celebration of 38th Anniversary of Zi Jing Ge Moral Uplifting Society, which

8.3 

Corporate Governance 

Goodland is committed to ensuring and maintaining a high standard of corporate 

governance and business conduct to safeguard the interests of its stakeholders. We are 

dedicated to uphold integrity and honesty in our operations.  The Board acknowledges 

that it is responsible for the governance of risks and the overall internal control framework, 

but recognises that no cost effective internal control system will preclude all errors and 

irregularities, as the system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure 

to achieve business objectives, and can provide only reasonable and not absolute 

assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poor judgment in decision-making, 

human errors, losses, fraud or other irregularities. The Board will, on a continuing basis, 

endeavour to further enhance and improve the Group’s system of internal controls and 

risk management policies. 

 

ANTI-CORRUPTION 

 

The Group has incorporated “whistle blowing” procedures as part of the Group’s system 

of internal controls. This is to provide a channel for employees of the Group to report in 

good faith and in confidence, without fear of reprisals, concerns about possible 

improprieties in financial reporting and other matters. The objective of the policy is to 

ensure that there is independent investigation of such matters and that appropriate 

follow up actions will be taken.  For FY2020, there were no reports received. 

 


10 | P a g e 

 



In addition, the Group sets out expectations of employees in relation to issues such as 

fraud, conflicts of interest and anti-competitive conduct in the employees’ handbook.  

For FY2020, the Group achieved the target of zero confirmed incidents of concerning 

employees or business partners.  

 

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS &amp; REGULATIONS 

 

The Group adheres to the Code of Corporate Governance 2018, listing rules and 

regulations set out by SGX, the MAS Securities and Futures Act, the Singapore Code of 

Advertising Practice, the Personal Data Protection Act, as well as all other applicable 

laws and regulations. 

 

For our developments, the Group is subject to regulations administered by Urban 

Redevelopment Authority (URA), Building and Construction Authority (BCA), National 

Environment Agency (NEA), Public Utilities Board (PUB), Land Transport Authority (LTA) 

and others. 

 

There were no incidents of non-compliance with laws and regulations, including 

environmental regulations and marketing guidelines, resulting in significant fines or 

sanctions in FY2020. 

 

8.4 

Performance Measurement 

The factors identified and the corresponding performance measurement during the 

financial year ended 30 September 2020 are shown in Table 8.1 below. 

 

We have set the same qualitative and quantitative sustainability targets for FY2021, as

RESPONSE TO COVID-19 

 

The global outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has inevitably impacted all trades in 

Singapore and the rest of the world. The Singapore Government has gradually 

implemented a series of measures to reduce and slow the transmission of the virus, 

including tight border control, safe distancing, crowd control and the ‘Circuit Breaker’, 

whereby all non-essential businesses must stop operating for a period from 7 April 2020 to 

4 May 2020 and then for extended period, between 5 May 2020 and 1 June 2020. Various 

financing support, tax and other temporary relief measures have also been introduced to 

help Singapore businesses.  

 

In Singapore, the sale of development properties has slowed down with the closure of all 

our showrooms and only digital sales and marketing activities are carried out. The Group 

expects our development sales to be affected. Most of our construction projects have just 

obtained the relevant authorities’ permit to work by end of July 2020 The Group is now 

planning and managing our resources to complete our projects on time.   

 

In respect of our commercial and industrial leases in Singapore, we will render assistance 

to our tenants that had been genuinely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as 

passing on property tax rebates to our tenants.  

 

During the ‘Circuit Breaker’ period, remote working has become the ‘new normal’ for the 

society and we have arranged our employee and director to work virtually. We have set 

up a connection with the security feature added for employees to access the internal 

data and provided necessary hardware that allows employees to work from home. We 

also divided the employee to a different group and each of the groups is not allowed to 

meet. Employee only allows going back office when they can justify certain work is not 

possible to perform virtually and is necessary to be completed in time. Prior approval must 

be obtained before they can go back to the office. Employees are required to wear a 

face mask and keep social distancing when they are in office. We have not retrenched 

and implemented any pay-cut for our employee due to the Covid-19 situation. 

 

Moreover, to comply with Safety Management Measures imposed in the development 

and construction sector, we are required to enforce health and safety procedures on 

construction site. Employees are required to join the safe management officer course for 

construction and pass the exam. Several safety measurement are taking places in 

construction site and office building to ensure the wellbeing of our employee. The 

measurement include safety precaution reminder signboard, disinfect office building 

twice a day, contact tracing system, health declaration form by visitor and installation of 

the face recognition thermal scan.  

 

The Group expects the next 12 months to be very challenging. The full extent of the impact 

cannot be determined at this stage. The Group is actively monitoring the development of 

this pandemic outbreak and will continue to exercise prudence and focus on taking 

necessary initiatives to moderate the impact. Our Group will continue to look for 

development and investment opportunities, both locally and regionally, while exercising 

caution.
