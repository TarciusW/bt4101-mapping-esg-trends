STATEMENT FROM THE BOARD 

 

The Board of Directors of Hotel Properties Limited (the “Board”) is pleased to present our Sustainability 

Report for the financial year 2019 (1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019). This is the third year we are 

publishing our Sustainability Report, and we wish to demonstrate our continued commitment to adopting 

sustainability best practices that are integral to our business.  

This report communicates our performance and progress in the key Environmental, Social and Governance 

(“ESG”) aspects identified through our materiality assessment. These include – occupational health and 

safety, training and education of employees, and energy and water consumption, in seven1 of our 

properties. This report sets out how we manage our impacts in these areas as well as our performance and 

goals for the upcoming year.  By monitoring our goals and performance, we look to build a strong and 

enduring business that will continue to create value for all of us. Additionally, we have identified a new 

aspect that is material to our operations – phasing out of plastic packaging in our hotels. We look to report 

further on this aspect in our subsequent Sustainability Reports.

ABOUT THIS REPORT 

 

This report is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Reference 

Claims, the international standard for sustainability reporting. For further information on the relevant 

references, kindly refer to the Table of GRI Content Index found on page 31.  

This sustainability report covers the sustainability performance for the material ESG aspects of our 

operations in seven hotels and resorts across Indonesia, the Maldives, Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia 

for the financial year ended in 2019. The hotels include Holiday Inn Resort Kandooma in Maldives, Four 

Seasons Sayan and Four Seasons Jimbaran in Bali, Hard Rock Hotel Penang, Hard Rock Hotel Bali, Concorde 

Hotel Singapore, and Hard Rock Hotel Pattaya (“selected hotels”).  

All data and activities reported were from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019 for these selected hotels,

Management Approach 

We understand the landscape is changing and sustainability is an increasingly important issue for us, our 

guests and business partners. We consult and share our sustainability performance with our key 

stakeholders and balance their interest with the Group’s objectives. Our business divisions are responsible 

for identifying, implementing sustainability initiatives while the Board and Audit Committee sets the 

direction and tone for the Group and has an overview of it. [This material references disclosures: 102-9, 102-12, 102-

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND MATERIALITY REVIEW 

We engage our stakeholders through various channels to obtain their feedback regarding our operations 

and our sustainability performance. In 2017, we identified key stakeholder groups that influence our 

performance and provide key insights to enhance our sustainability practice. We conducted a stakeholder 

engagement exercise where the key stakeholders recorded their expectations and concerns on 

sustainability matters for HPL. This was disclosed in our inaugural sustainability report. Last year, we 

reported our progress and performance on these ESG aspects. 

Based on the responses received from our stakeholders, we identified four key ESG aspects that impact 

our business, including employee health and safety, employee training and education, energy consumption, 

water consumption. 

This year, we continue reporting our progress on the four key ESG aspects that impact our business. We 

have set targets for improvement and have reported our performance in the year 2019.  

This year, we have also identified an additional aspect that is material to our operations – phasing out of 

plastic packaging in our hotels. Our hotels have set targets with this regard.

EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY 

Overview 

Employees are the key asset to the Group, hence their health, safety and wellbeing have always remained 

our top priority. We are committed to continuously improving our work environment to ensure the safety 

of our employees, while also aiming to improve their performance. We closely monitor our hotels to 

maintain excellent occupational health and safety (OHS) standards. We work with our hotels to ensure they 

have the resources they need to uphold the OHS standard for their employees and ensure a safe stay for 

all our guests.  

[This material references disclosures 103-1 from GRI 102: Management Approach 2016] 

Management Approach 

Our hotels have developed a number of policies and procedures for OHS, which are consistent with local 

legislation and industry regulations. Our hotels have systems and resources to drive these policies and 

safeguard the health and safety of all our hotel staff.  

Some of the specific regulation that we adhere to in each country include: 

Health and safety policies developed by our hotels  

 

Beach Tsunami Evacuation

Malaysia 

 Occupational Safety &amp; Health Act 1994 

 Employees Safety &amp; Health Awareness policy statement 

 Notification of Accident, Dangerous Occurrence, Occupation Poisoning and 

Occupational Diseases 2004 

 Establishment of OHS Committee Regulations 

 Food Safety Management System 

Singapore 

 Workplace Safety &amp; Health Act, Chapter 354A of the Singapore Statutes 

 Employment Act, Chapter 51 of the Singapore Statutes 

Our approach to safeguarding the health and safety of our employees includes setting up committees 

dedicated to managing OHS-specific issues in our hotels.  For instance, Holiday Inn Resort Kandooma 

established a Risk and Safety Committee. The committee is responsible for regular OHS inspections and 

holds monthly meetings to discuss any identified areas of concern. By doing this they ensure such concerns 

are appropriately addressed. The committee also carries out monthly training for our employees on safety 

and health concerns. The resort conducted various technical and operational training on safe workplace 

practices. A ten-minute health and safety briefing is conducted each month to ensure employees are always 

aware of workplace safety. Hard Rock Hotel Pattaya has adopted the National Sanitation Foundation’s (NSF) 

Comprehensive Sanitation Regulation and Practices that targets to improve food safety, and health and 

safety practices. NSF audits are conducted twice a year to ensure OHS standards are maintained.  

Four Seasons Jimbaran also implemented OHS-related initiatives. In 2019, the resort’s technician and boiler 

obtained a government certification. The resort also runs a quarterly wellness programme to promote the 

healthy wellbeing of all its employees. Four Seasons Sayan has developed a Standard Operating Procedure 

on New Fire Blanket to ensure the safety of its employees and guests. 

The management of OHS in our hotels and resorts is carried out by a dedicated workforce who are well 

equipped with technical and field knowledge. The Executive Committee, in many of our hotels, resolve 

concerns and issues in these matters. The general manager, enterprise asset manager and risk manager 

are also responsible to look after OHS-related issues in our hotels. We also conduct regular third-party 

audits and inspections to check for compliance and ensure best practices to maintain employee health and 

well-being. We also provide training, medical check-ups and personal protective equipment for employees, 

where necessary.  

The employee health and safety is monitored through technology set-up by some of our hotels. These 

include surveillance systems and time attendance software to increase the safety of the guests and 

employees. The reporting systems used to track and monitor OHS incidents are tailored to each hotel and 

resort. For instance, at Hard Rock Hotel Bali, the Duty Manager is responsible to raise an accident report 

after investigation. The accident report documents the name of the injured staff, department, position, 

time, place, description or chronology of accident or injury, hotel action, staff action, and the name of the 

Duty Manager. OHS incidents are managed by the Safety and Security Department at Hard Rock Hotel 

Penang. The incident report is recorded and managed by the human resources department. Four Seasons 

Jimbaran and Four Seasons Sayan use an online database to record the incident report. At Hard Rock Hotel 

Pattaya, incidents and accidents are reported using the incident reporting system which is kept at the loss 

prevention office.  

[This material references disclosures 103-2 and 103-3 from GRI 103: Management Approach 2016]

Performance 

We record all OHS incidents and track and measure our performance on a regular basis. In 2019, a total 

of 1,647 lost days were reported by our hotels compared to 1,762 days in 2018. All of our hotels have 

reported no incident of work-related fatality in 2019.

disease. Absentee excludes permitted leave absences such as holidays, study, maternity or paternity leave, and compassionate leave.

Performance Metrics 

Most of the hotels have achieved their targets for 2019. For instance, Holiday Inn Resort Kandooma reduced 

from 79 injuries reported in 2018 to 58 injuries in the year 2019. The resort has taken measures such as 

conducting monthly risk assessments and increasing the safety awareness training to all their staff. 

However, some hotels faced challenges with the OHS-related targets due to unforeseen circumstances. 

The hotels are highly concerned about workplace and employee safety. Hence, new OHS-related targets 

were set to equip employees with safety awareness through training. Hotels also ensure that work areas 

will be inspected regularly on a risk-based approach to identify potential hazards and provide preventive 

measures to reduce injuries in 2020.  

To ensure continuous improvement, we have established the following goals for FY2020.

EMPLOYEE TRAINING AND EDUCATION 

Overview 

Employees play a vital role in business continuity. Through their warm hospitality, they ensure that our 

guests have a satisfying stay in our hotels and resorts. In return, we are committed to creating an 

environment that would help our employees achieve their career goals. We are also committed to growing 

a workforce that is highly skilled and aligned with the industry’s emerging demands. Our goal is to continue 

providing quality training to our employees to enhance the quality of service we provide to our guests.  

As per local legislations, it is mandated for hotels located in Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia to deliver 

employee training. These include the Skill Development Promotion Act 2002 in Thailand, the Indonesian 

Labour Law (Law No. 21 of 1999) and country regulations in Malaysia that involve contributions to the 

Human Resource Development Fund. HPL is aware and in compliance with such mandates, where 

applicable.  

[This material references disclosures 103-1 from GRI 103: Management Approach 2016] 

Management Approach 

To ensure the high quality of our service delivery across all the hotels and resorts we manage, we have 

developed our policies on training and education. These include:  

 

Policy on Training and Development 

 

Policy on Department Trainers 

 

Policy on Training Committee  

HPL’s Policy on Training and Development covers processes and practices in all HPL managed hotels. The 

policy was developed to aid the delivery of training and development in an effective, systematic and 

comprehensive way.  

Under the policy, HPL managed hotels must develop an employee training plan including a suite of 

programmes delivered as part of the training roadmap. The HPL Hotel and Resort Policy on Training and 

Development cover areas of commitment by the hotels, roles and responsibilities of every division, annual 

property training plan (for HPL managed hotels) and budget, training priorities, and training procedures. 

With such efforts, we hope to build a competent, effective and happy workforce in HPL hotels and resorts. 

The Training Roadmap is a suite of mandatory programmes for the four job families or levels of staff: Staff, 

Supervisors, Managers and Department Heads. 

Examples of Mandatory Programmes include: 

 Great Guest Experience Workshop 

 Working Safely 

 Personal Effectiveness 

 Train-the-Trainer 1  

 Coaching the Team 

 Leading Team Performance 

 The Pulse 

 Management Synergy 


15 

 

Training and development in HPL managed hotels go through a complete cycle of a training needs analysis 

to develop a training plan, the implementation of the plan, and the evaluation of the completed training to 

determine the effectiveness of the training and development interventions. In addition, every property has 

a training and development leader who is responsible to champion and manage the training and 

development system and initiatives.  

Hotel-specific Training Initiatives 

Holiday Inn Resort Kandooma implemented talent and development programmes for their employees. 

These included Cross Exposure Training Program, Craft Training Certification, Training &amp; Development for 

Business, Accelerated Leadership Development Programs Modules, and Learning and Development Needs 

Analysis.  

Four Seasons Jimbaran provided their employees in the operations department with Service Foundations 

training. The resort provided Food &amp; Beverage Training and Fire Safety training for their employees. The 

resort has also updated the HACCP training matrix record that lists out the expected competency-based 

training with mandatory completion by all employees and contractors. Four Seasons Sayan provided training 

to all guest-facing employees on service foundations guidelines to build the competency of the employees 

on better guest interaction. The resort rolled out new interview guidelines for all Managers to assist them 

in the selection and hiring process.  

Hard Rock Hotel Pattaya has established a new system, Hotel Service Optimisation System (HotSOS), to 

support hotel operations. The technology allows employees to connect and manage their departments from 

their device through a real-time concept. This initiative was implemented to reduce any incidents to hotel 

guests, service delays and schedule preventive maintenance. In addition, all the hotels in scope offer 

orientation and/or on-boarding training for employees within the first few months of employment. This on-

boarding training typically includes mandatory courses and supplemented with additional training courses. 

Training and education in all our hotels are managed through the significant allocation of investment in 

capable training leads and online courses. In many of our hotels, the Training and Development Manager 

typically leads the training functions. However, in some of our hotels, the responsibility may be attributed 

to the General Manager, Department Heads, Talent Development Manager and/or Director of Human 

Resources. All our hotels set aside a budget for training and development, based on the training plan 

developed for the particular year. Some of our hotels also provide e-learning and online courses for training 

their employees.

Performance Metrics 

 

We are proud to report that more than 90% of our hotels in scope achieved their 2019 targets in equipping 

their workforce with relevant knowledge and skills to carry out their respective tasks effectively and safely. 

In 2019, the employees in the hotels in scope received an average of 42 hours of training. Hard Rock Hotel 

Bali and Hard Rock Hotel Pattaya exceeded their targets for training hours by at least 15 hours of additional 

training provided to their employees on an average. In 2020, many hotels have maintained their target and 

have plans in completing training plans for their staff.  

To ensure continuous improvement, we have established the following goals for FY2020.

ENERGY 

Overview  

As we work towards minimising the negative environmental impact through our business operation, we aim 

to reduce emissions by adopting effective energy management.  

 [This material references disclosures 103-1 from GRI 103: Management Approach 2016] 

Management Approach 

We aim to maximise energy efficiency across all our hotels and have dedicated staff to manage this aspect. 

We identified energy-saving opportunities across all our hotels. Some of these initiatives include the 

installation of LED lights in our hotel landscapes and install energy-saving equipment where possible. The 

engineering teams led by the chief engineer tracks energy consumption in our hotels. In some hotels, the 

general manager also works alongside the chief engineer to monitor and implement energy-saving 

initiatives.

Performance 

We are committed to reducing our energy use as a way of mitigating adverse impacts on the environment. 

The total energy consumed in our seven selected hotels for 2019 was 270,389.88 Giga-Joule (GJ).  

Our major source of energy consumption was from the use of electricity, which accounted for 148,538.81 

GJ. Significant energy consumption was also from non-renewable sources such as Diesel, Natural Gas and 

Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), which accounted for 121,851.07 GJ.

Performance Metrics 

 

Hotels in scope achieved their targets set for 2019 in addressing key issues related to energy. The main 

source of their electricity usage in hotels has been from halogen lights, type of refrigerator used, chillers, 

air-conditioners and more. Our hotels have changed their traditional lights (such as halogen lights) to LED 

lighting which is more energy-efficient. Some hotels have also taken the initiative to switch off the main 

electricity source for unoccupied rooms when the total hotel occupancy is lower than 40%. This year, our 

hotels have set more stringent targets to ensure energy-efficient operations.

WATER 

Overview 

Our hotels and resorts use a significant amount of water for running their daily operations – laundry, guest 

rooms, swimming pools, etc. However, many of the regions in which we operate face water-stress and 

scarcity. We are aware of the importance and the responsible use of this resource in order to receive a 

sustainable water supply in our operations. Therefore, HPL is committed to using water responsibly and 

reduce water consumption by installing water-saving equipment. Additionally, we also continuously 

promote awareness of water conservation across all our selected hotels.   

[This material references disclosures 103-1 from GRI 103: Management Approach 2016] 

Management Approach 

Our hotels and resorts have implemented several measures to use water wisely. One of the initiatives is by 

building awareness regarding water conservation. In 2019, Holiday Inn Resort Kandooma launched an 

awareness campaign for all employees regarding the need to reduce water consumption. The resort also 

placed a Green Engage Information Board to keep employees updated on the amount of water they 

consumed. Concorde Hotel Singapore in 2019 mandated all their taps to carry an approved water-saving 

sign to better inform guests and employees on reducing water use.  

Some of our hotels and resorts also take active measures to identify and repair leaks to avoid water loss. 

Hard Rock Hotel in Bali continued repair works to reduce water leaks from the main pools. The hotel has 

also hired a vendor to identify underground pipe leakages. This is being done using an acoustic camera.  

Some of our hotels use the latest technology to manage water consumption and prevent losses. The Hard 

Rock Hotel Penang has installed self-closing water taps in all guest bathrooms and in all staff basin water 

taps. The hotel has also installed battery operated water tap for toilets. Similarly, Hard Rock Hotel Bali has 

installed a stop valve for their shower to save water and an LED indicator sensor in all toilet urinals. The 

LED indicator saves water from repeated flushing in addition to improving hygiene. Concorde Hotel 

Singapore has the provision of private meters to monitor daily water usage for different areas such as 

cooling towers, swimming pools, kitchen, and tenant usage.  

Some of our hotels also actively practice rainwater harvesting. For instance, the Holiday Inn Resort 

Kandooma has continued its initiative of collecting rainwater in order to reduce the demand for energy 

from consuming desalinated water. The rainwater collection tanks are connected to the main water tank 

to be used for daily operations. 

[This material references disclosures 102-11, 103-2 and 103-3 from GRI 103: Management Approach 2016] 

Performance 

We are committed to reducing our water consumption as a way of mitigating adverse impacts on the 

environment. The total water consumed in the seven selected hotels for 2019 was 1,023,213 m3. We are 

proud to report that, as compared to the water consumption in 2018, we have consumed 30,378 m3 less 

water in 2019. The hotels in the scope of this report withdrew 40.82% of the water from municipal sources, 

25.03% from groundwater sources, 29.37% from surface water sources such as rivers and oceans, 4.70% 

from recycled wastewater and the rest 0.88% from rainwater.    


22 

 

We are committed to reducing our annual water consumption. Our water consumption data has been 

captured using daily meter readings. We also track the consumption of water within our facilities on a 

monthly basis.

Performance Metrics 

Most of our hotels in scope have exceeded the target in reducing water consumption in their operations. 

This was possible due to initiatives such as using recycling wastewater for landscaping purposes and toilet 

renovations, and harvesting rainwater for other hotel operations. However, some hotels were not able to 

reach their target because of the excess use of water due to unexpected prolonged dry seasons. Boiler 

leakage also caused high water consumption in one of the hotels. Nonetheless, hotels undertook other 

initiatives to counter waste wastage. Some of our hotels removed bathtubs and installed water-efficient 

showers, vanity taps and toilets to reduce water consumption in 2019. Moving forward, hotels are setting 

ambitious targets for further reducing their water consumption and wastage.  

To ensure continuous improvement, we have established the following goals for FY2020. 

Goals and Targets 

 

 

Holiday Inn Resort 

Kandooma 

• To reduce water consumption by 1% per occupied room 

 

Four Seasons

PHASING OUT PLASTIC PACKAGING 

 

Overview 

Plastic has a diverse usage within the hospitality industry. Hotels widely use products that are packaged in 

plastic; such as water bottles, bathroom amenities such as shampoo bottles, soaps bottles, plastic 

toothbrushes and many more. However, it is undeniable that plastic produces negative impacts on the 

environment. Improper waste management of single-use plastics is one of the top sources of pollutions in 

our oceans3. Studies suggest that about 300 million tons of plastics are produced and over 8 million tons 

of plastics are dumped to our oceans every year4. These worrying numbers have influenced consumers to 

choose travel service providers that are making efforts in reducing single-use plastics in their operations.   

A calculation made by an expert for Eco-Business estimated that a single 200-room of a four-star hotel 

uses about 300,000 pieces of single-use plastic in a month if it is at full capacity and does not invest in any 

eco-friendly alternatives, is a wakeup call for major hotel chains5. In a survey by Skift Research’s U.S. 

Experiential Traveller in 2019, 53% of the respondents are willing to pay higher rates to travel service 

providers that demonstrated environmental responsibility6.  

This has made hospitality industry players undertake measures and practices to phase out single-use 

plastics in their day-to-day operations. In Green Lodging Trends 2018 report, revealed that some of the 

initiatives taken by hotels include the elimination of plastic straws, implementing reducing plastic usage 

policies in using shampoo dispensers in bathrooms and reusable food service wares7. HPL is aware of such 

trends and is strongly committed to reducing plastic consumption in our hotel operations through 

replacements of single-use plastics with eco-friendly packaging alternatives.  

Management Approach 

Our hotels respond to these alarming environmental issues by taking measures in reducing plastic usage 

in their day-to-day business operations. Our hotels are setting targets for the year 2020 to implement 

initiatives such as changing toiletries from single-use small bottles to refillable plungers to reduce plastic 

consumption. For example, Hard Rock Hotel Pattaya has planned to roll out its initiative in Q3 2020 to 

replace plastic toiletries with eco-friendly alternative packaging. Adding to this initiative, the hotel also plans 

to change complimentary plastic bottles to refillable glass bottles in Q4 in the year 2020.
