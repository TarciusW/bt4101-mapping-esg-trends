MESSAGE FROM THE BOARD 

 

4 

Dear Stakeholders,  

 

XMH is pleased to present our Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 30 April 2021 

(“FY2021”), which formalises and demonstrates our commitment towards building a more sustainable 

future.  

 

This report captures the Group’s approach towards environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) risks 

and opportunities, as well as our sustainability performance for FY2021.   

 

The Group has considered various concerns raised by our key stakeholders through stakeholder 

engagements which will be explained in this Report. Please refer to the “Stakeholder Engagement” on 

pages 8-9. This Report also highlights our sustainable practices embedded across XMH’s business 

operations and our commitment to achieve the right balance of business values, sustainable growth, 

employee relationship and efforts in corporate compliance and governance. 

 

Lastly, we would like to thank our key stakeholders, business partners and employees who have 

contributed to this Report and been with us in this sustainability journey. We hope to continue to work 

as a united and cohesive team and do our best to deliver optimal results and returns for our shareholders. 

This report complements our financial and corporate governance disclosures in our Annual Report and 

should be read together with our Annual Report 2021 for a holistic view of the Group’s performance in 

FY2021. 

 

 

Sincerely,  

 

Board of Directors 

XMH Holdings Ltd.

COMPANY BACKGROUND 

 

6 

Our Vision 

To be Asia’s most trusted partner in power solutions. 

 

Our Mission 

To deliver optimal and reliable solutions to our marine and industrial customers. 

 

Our Company’s Values 

• 

Collaboration for success – Through teamwork and working closely with customers, we deliver 

the best possible solutions to meet customers’ needs. 

 

• 

Strive for progress – We seek to continually improve our level of proficiency and expertise in 

our scope of work. 

 

• 

Integrity in all we do – We adhere to ethical principles in all our dealings with business partners, 

colleagues and ourselves. 

 

• 

Belief in people – We believe our staffs are capable of performing to expectations and have the 

potential to attain higher standards of excellence when nurtured. 

 

• 

Commitment to reliability – We pledge to only deliver optimally dependable solutions that fulfil 

customers’ requirements. 

 

• 

Resourcefulness for the right solutions – We employ clever and enterprising methods to devise 

optimal products and/or services suited to meet customers’ needs. 

 

Governance Structure 

Our sustainability efforts are being monitored by the Group’s senior management where they assess the 

Group’s performance from economic, environmental, social and governance perspectives. Senior 

management is also responsible for the on-going communication of such assessments to the Board of 

Directors (“Board”). The governance structure of the Group can be found in our Annual Report 2021 

(“AR 2021”), page 21.  


SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH 

 

7 

External Initiatives 

The Group believes that an organisation’s success is not measured solely by its business achievements, 

but also the active role it plays in upholding good corporate practices and its ability to make positive 

impact on the society, economy and environment that it operates in.  With this belief, the Group would 

make donations to multiple organisations in need as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) 

efforts.  

The COVID-19 pandemic did not deter the Group from continuing its CSR efforts. However, in view 

of the uncertainty brought about by the pandemic, the Group needed to be prudent to maintain its 

liquidity for its operational needs. Therefore, instead of donating to multiple organisations, the Group 

has donated to one organisation this year - Yayasan Plan International Indonesia. 

The Group will continue to implement CSR initiatives with consistency and determination because it 

believes that having a positive impact on societal issues is not a “quick fix” project. 

 

 

Members of Associations 

The Group has obtained several certifications through its subsidiaries, Xin Ming Hua Pte Ltd 

(“XMHPL”) and Mech-Power (“MPG”).  Both XMHPL and MPG have obtained Certifications for: 

i) 

ISO 9001:2015 (Quality Management System);   

ii) 

ISO 45001:2018 (Occupational Health &amp; Safety Management Systems); and  

iii) 

BizSAFE Star Certification from the Workplace Safety and Health Council. 


SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH

Governance and Sustainability Approach 

The Group’s senior management is responsible for the on-going communication of the key topics 

identified as well as meeting the expectations of the key stakeholders. The Group embraces 

sustainability on strategic and operational levels and is committed to conduct its business activities in 

an ethical, socially and environmentally sustainable manner.

and assess the material aspects in relation to our business operations. The Group engages different 

stakeholders on an ongoing basis to address their concerns and expectations.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE  

 

12 

The Group’s business activities are: 

1) Distribution and provision of value-added products and services; 

2) After-sales services, trading and others; and 

3) Projects, which comprise the assembly and installation of standby generator sets and provision 

of related services. 

XMH will continue to explore initiatives to improve its financials and operations. We have been 

working well with our established partners to ensure that relationships forged will be mutually 

beneficial to our economic and operational stability. 

 

 

For the Financial Year Ended 30 April 2021 (“FY2021”), the Group recorded a net profit attributable 

to shareholders of S$0.9 million in as compared to S$10.9 million loss in the previous financial year. 

This was mainly due to good operational performance achieved by the Group despite having to face 

with the COVID-19 pandemic. The good performance coupled with increased cost efficiencies; the 

Group managed to record a profit attributable to the Owners of the Company of S$0.9 million.  

For more information on XMH’s economic performance, please refer to our AR 2021 – Operations and 

Financial Review (page 12) and Financial Statements (page 69) for detailed financial performance of 

the Group. 

While FY2021 had been a challenging year, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that we are adaptable 

and resilient. We will continue with these traits and leverage on our capabilities and markets we operate 

in.  To stay afloat and remain competitive, the Group will continue to manage its operating cost and 

ensure sufficient liquidity to sustain its operations.

As at 30 April 2021, we have about 200 employees. The Group adopts a fair and holistic hiring approach 

by taking into consideration of external factors such as experience and special skillsets, apart from 

qualifications. The Group believes that the diverse background of each individual employee will 

contribute to the Company’s growth in the future. XMH also provides a wide range of benefits for full 

time employment such as: 

• 

Insurance coverage and healthcare benefits

We will continue to improve the working environment and create more value for our employees through 

different initiatives, such as trainings or job rotation to expose our employees to different skillsets and 

areas of expertise. We seek to achieve effective communication across the organisation by gathering 

valuable feedback from our employees to ensure continuous improvement of the workplace 

environment. We will continue to practice non-discrimination in hiring employees of different age 

groups and ensure gender equality at all times.  

 

Training 

XMH believes in upgrading one’s skills to cater to evolving and dynamic working environments. We 

have career development programs for all levels of employees to equip them with the skillsets required.  

Hence, we are committed to learning and development programs to drive productivity and develop the 

personal effectiveness of our employees.  In FY2021, our employees clocked a total of 166 hours of 

training (both in-house and external) as compared to the target of 250 hours.  We are 33% below target 

hours due mainly to the restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  On the job training and off-

site training were disrupted.  For FY2022, we hope to achieve a total of 200 hours as the Group adjusts 

and adapts to the new normal caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 


EMPLOYMENT  

 

14 

Our employees receive periodic performance reviews in accordance with our human resource policy. 

In FY2021, all our staff received regular performance reviews in line with the Group’s policies. 

Furthermore, XMH advocates two-way communication between employees and their superiors. Any 

concerns raised by the employees would be considered and this process helps the management to 

identify areas for change to further enhance the working environment in XMH.

Quality of Sales and Services 

 

We take pride in our products and services delivered to the customers. Maintaining the quality of 

products sold and services rendered remain as one of the key fundamentals in our business. We place 

great emphasis on quality control to ensure consistent quality standards that meet the requirements of 

our customers. In FY2021, there were no instances of customers rejecting deliveries due to defective or 

unsatisfactory products. Our target for FY2022 is to maintain zero instances of rejection.  

Our quality control personnel work closely with our production team to ensure that the existing 

production flow and methods achieve the required standards of quality, and that innovation and 

improvements are continually introduced to our business processes to improve quality standards. We 

pledge to deliver prompt and optimally dependable solutions that meet the dynamic requirements of our 

customers. As such, we have established the following quality assurance and control systems to ensure 

consistency in the quality of our services and the products and services that we deliver.  

 



Product Handling and Service Quality Check Procedures 

Products purchased/designed/manufactured, including technical specifications and 

compliance documents, are inspected at various stages. It is our policy to track and keep 

internal records of all incoming diesel engines, power generating sets and certain related 

components to allow us to provide timely feedback to our principals and/or suppliers. 

Outgoing products are checked against order specification and load tested before delivery 

to our customers, including supervision on installation and commissioning to ensure they 

meet the requisite performance specifications. 



Customer Relationship Management 

We believe that feedback from our customers and our timely response is vital for us to 

remain competitive in this industry. We ensure that our sales and services staff receive 

adequate training and are equipped with the necessary skills and right attitudes when 

dealing and negotiating with our customers. We have implemented an Enterprise 

Resource Planning (“ERP”) system which allows us to track our sales leads and 

enquiries, customer feedbacks and our follow-up actions.   


LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE 

 

16 

XMH’s Ethical Principles 

 

Anti-corruption 

XMH believes that good corporate governance within the organisation is the foundation of an ethical 

working environment for all employees. XMH has put in place a whistle-blowing policy outlined in the 

employee handbook to emphasise the importance of ethical business practices. The Group encourages 

any employee to whistle-blow and raise any concerns relating to any suspected improper business 

activities. In the event of a reported whistleblowing case, the Audit Committee ensures that an 

investigation is carried out and followed by appropriate remedial actions. 

In FY2021, we had zero cases of corruption highlighted to the Audit Committee. Moving forward, the 

Group will continue to uphold good corporate governance and comply with the relevant laws and 

regulations that the business operates in. We hope to maintain the target of zero reports on potential 

corruption cases for FY2022. 

 

Environmental and Socioeconomic Compliance 

XMH is aware of the potential exposure and resulting penalties of not complying with the relevant laws 

and regulations, including our products and services which may cause the Group to suffer from 

reputation damage and loss of business opportunities. Through an established business strategy/ model 

that incorporates ethical principles and accountability, the Group is committed to keeping the business 

sustainable. We ensure that we are fully compliant with applicable laws and regulations in the countries 

that we operate in. In FY2021, there were no incidents of non-compliance with relevant laws and 

regulations that could result in either public allegation of non-compliance or penalties. Moving forward 

for FY2022, we hope to maintain the target of zero incidents reported to uphold good governance 

practice and comply with laws and regulations.
