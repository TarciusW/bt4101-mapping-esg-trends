BOARD STATEMENT

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present our Sustainability

believe that building a sustainable business is vital to our continued success 

and that we must be fully accountable for our impact on the environment, our 

customers, our people and our community.

The delivery of sustainable results is a critical aspect of our ability to remain 

as a strong and financially stable company. Acknowledging this helps to 







put into focus our commitment

The COVID-19 pandemic and its 

resulting economic uncertainties

and consumer sentiment in the 

various countries we operate in. We 

have worked on the digitalisation 

of our business, unlocking new 

avenues to reach our clientele

unforeseen operational changes. 

We will continue to leverage on our 

branding, store network, innovation 

and staff training to further improve

6.1 PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT FOR THE FUTURE 

GENERATIONS

6.1.1 Reduction of Carbon Footprint

We recognise that the effective management and monitoring of our carbon footprint can reduce operating costs, raise 

brand profile, create a competitive edge and increase stakeholders’ value. Our carbon footprint is measured in terms 

of Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emission. However, GHG emission is an absolute measure of how much carbon dioxide 

equivalent (CO2e) is emitted. Our GHG emission is predominantly indirect (Scope 2) emission that result from the 

electricity used. We have insignificant direct (Scope 1) emission, and we do not include the GHG emissions generated 

by our suppliers (Scope 3).

Considering the changes and dynamics of our business and operations, we have established our GHG emission 

efficiency index for consistent tracking of carbon footprint over time. To this end, we have set a target for GHG emission 

efficiency improvement of 23% from our FY2017 level by FY2030. Our target for GHG emission improvement is 1% 


STAKEHOLDER

ENGAGEMENT

09

MAXI-CASH FINANCIAL SERVICES CORPORATION LTD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2020

per year. Although various business lines and operations account for different percentages of GHG emissions across 

the Group, they have supported and aligned their environmental objectives accordingly.

In FY2020, our GHG emission efficiency index stands at 3.29. In comparison to our base year FY2017 index at 3.73, 

it is a 11.80% improvement towards our target by FY2030. For more details on the GHG emission efficiency index, 

please refer to Section 7.1 of the Sustainability Report.

6.1.2 Reduction of Paper Consumption

All our employees are encouraged to minimize paper usage at work by adhering to our paperless initiative.

We encourage all employees to adopt digital documents instead of paper documents with an aim to further reduce 

paper consumption.

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, we have established our paper consumption 

index for consistent tracking of paper consumption over time. Due to the successful implementation of our paperless 

initiative, we have recorded a significant improvement in our paper consumption since FY2018. Hence, we would like 

to revise our paper consumption improvement target from 23% to 40% by 2030. Our target for paper consumption 

improvement is about 3% per year. Although various business lines and operations account for different percentage 

of paper consumption across the organisation, they have aligned their environmental objectives accordingly.

In FY2020, we consumed a total of 2,513 kg of paper, 100% of which are either Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) 

certified, Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (“PEFC”) certified, ecological responsibility or made 

from KHAN-NA, which promotes energy and water efficiency throughout the mill, the former is by following a “Waste 

Not, Want Not” principle where all tree waste from pulp and paper production are turned into renewable biomass 

power, while the latter through the recycling of waste water to be reused within the mill. Our paper consumption index 

stands at 9.79. In comparison to our base year FY2017 index at 14.3, it is a 31.5% improvement.

Our Human Resource (“HR”) management principles and policies have been developed and established based on fair 

employment practices, with the goal of attracting, developing and retaining a motivated workforce.

In view of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we protect the health and safety of our employees by allowing them to 

return to the office on a team rotation basis and encourage them to continue working from home, where possible.

6.2.2 Employment Practices

Our employment practices focus on maximizing the strength of our employees by providing equal opportunities based 

on merits, and helping our employees to develop strength through our comprehensive training and development 

programme.

6.2.2.1 The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices

We have adopted the best practices in our HR management. Our HR practices are guided by the Singapore Tripartite 

Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices. The Singapore Tripartite Alliance comprises the Ministry of 

Manpower, Singapore National Employers Federation and National Trades Union Congress.

6.2.2.2 Communications

As the Group grows, effective and open communications across the Group is crucial to ensure continuous alignment of 

objectives of the employees and the organisational objectives. We have achieved this through our various communication 

sessions customized based on the target employees. Communication sessions for our managers are held on a regular 

basis. Agendas covered at these sessions are customized to the target functional scope of the managers.

During the COVID-19 outbreak, regular communications on COVID-19 related information was provided to all employees 

through email or other internal communication.

6.2.2.3 Employee feedback

We value our employees’ expertise in their areas of responsibilities. Therefore, their feedback is important for the 

improvement of overall management and operation of the Group. Through various established processes of employees’ 

engagement, such as employee’s objective setting, performance review, as well as exit interviews in the case of 

resignations, we will be able to gather valuable feedback for the continuous improvement of the Group.

In addition, the Group’s whistle-blowing policy provides a transparent channel for employees to report any concern or 

complaint regarding any improper accounting or financial matters, internal controls, disclosure of information, conflict 

of interest, insider trading, or any other areas involving fraud, corruption and misconduct of employees. The public, 

customers and stakeholders can also report possible improprieties or provide other feedback through the Company’s 

website at https://maxi-cash.com/. There have been no incidents pertaining to whistle-blowing in FY2020.

6.2.2.4 Career Development and Training

We recognise that consistent and ongoing training is critical to maintaining a competitive, skilled, productive and 

motivated workforce.

In FY2020, each employee received an average of 5 hours of training. We recognised that the training requirements 

vary depending on the levels of management responsibilities. Each senior manager recorded an average of 15 hours 

of training, while managerial and non-managerial staffs recorded an average of 11 hours and 5 hours of training 

respectively. In light of changing business requirements and opportunities and the variety of training methodologies, 

we will continue to revise our training curriculum and programme to align with the Group’s objectives and to strive for 

effectiveness and efficiency in our training approach.

or religion. We are committed to maintaining a talented, dedicated and diverse workforce and to providing equal 

opportunities in employment.

In FY2020, 137 (34%) of our employees were male and 265 (66%) employees were female. In terms of management 

function, 26 males (50%) and 26 females (50%) held managerial positions, while 111 males (32%) and 239 females

We are committed to workplace safety and health, and we take precautions to prevent occupational injuries among 

our employees. We believe that safe work conditions boost work morale.

During the COVID-19 outbreak, we have representatives from each department in the Safe Management Committee 

to conduct inspections and checks, and remedy non-compliance, and assist in reinforcing and ensure understanding 

on internal communications on safe management measures.

6.2.6 Individual Rights

Respecting and protecting basic human rights is fundamental to all our Group’s operations. In FY2020, none of our

6.3 FOCUSING ON OUR CUSTOMERS’ NEEDS

6.3.1 Our Approach

Safety in our premises is always our priority.

6.3.2 Product Quality and Safety

Reliability and quality of our products are of paramount importance to us. Health and safety of our customers is always 

our priority. To ensure product safety for our customers, we have in place a set of key quality assurance processes to 

ensure compliance with regulations and international standards. We aim to totally eliminate product safety incidents 

so as to foster a ‘Safety First’ culture through employee training and quality control. No reports were received on non 

compliance with regulations or codes concerning health and safety of products and services for FY2020.

The Group’s retail and trading business (Maxi-Cash Retail Pte. Ltd.) attained CaseTrust accreditation from the CASE 

since October 2015. The accreditation reaffirms the Group’s commitment to fair trading and transparency to consumers.

6.4 PARTNERING OUR SUPPLIERS

6.4.1 Our Approach

We strive to encourage our suppliers to adopt sustainable practices. Supplier selection requires our key suppliers to 

disclose their sustainability practices.

6.4.2 Supplier Selection

We select our key suppliers based on criteria such as quality of products and services, competitiveness of pricing 

and financial health. We will require our suppliers to disclose their sustainable business practice. Sustainable business 

practice is one of the key criteria in our supplier selection.

TABLE

7.1 ENERGY USAGE AND CO2 EMISSIONS

Direct and indirect CO2 emissions as measure in GHG emissions are measured in tonnes (t-CO2) 

and kilowatt Hours (kWh), from electricity and fuel consumed. We purchased electricity from local 

electric retailers.

As our business and operations grow over time, our GHG emissions and electricity consumption 

will vary. To ensure consistency and comparability of the GHG emission and electricity consumption 

measures over time, we have created a GHG emission index and electricity consumption index for 

our performance monitoring. The index adjusts the GHG emissions and electricity consumption for the size of our 

activities. We normalize the amount of GHG emissions and electricity consumption by the size of our revenue which 

we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. The GHG emission index is measured in t-CO2 per SGD million and the 

electricity consumption index is measured in kWh per SGD million.

FY2020 Performance

FY2017 was our first year of reporting the performance. For performance tracking 

purpose, we will use FY2017 data as our base for our performance tracking towards 

our FY2030 goals.

As of FY2020, the GHG emission index stands at 3.29 and the electricity consumption 

index stands at 6,854, which is 11.8% and 10.8% respectively improvement from the 

base year. This was mainly due to minimal staff working in office during the COVID-19 

period and the closure of the stores during the circuit breaker period.

7.2 PAPER CONSUMPTION

We capture the data for paper consumption by the number of reams of paper used. One ream 

of paper is equivalent to 500 sheets of paper. To ensure consistency and comparability across 

various paper sizes, such as A3 and A4 papers, we measure the paper consumption by the weight 

of paper used which is adjusted for the various sizes and quality of paper.

As our business and operations grow over time, the paper consumption patterns will vary. We 

have devised a paper consumption index for our performance monitoring. The index adjusts the paper consumption 

for the size of our activities. We normalize the amount of weights of paper consumed by the size of our revenue which 

we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. The paper consumption index is measured in kilograms per SGD million.
