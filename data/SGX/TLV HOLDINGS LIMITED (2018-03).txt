Dear Stakeholders, 

We are delighted to present TLV Holdings Limited’s (the “Company”) and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) ﬁrst inaugural sustainability report. 

Sustainability has become a critical success factor for companies to ensure long-term value creation. The Group recognises the importance to maintain a 

balance between achieving long term proﬁtable growth and considering the environmental and social impact of our operations to the planet and people. 

This report marks a signiﬁcant milestone for the Group, as we have assessed and identiﬁed the topics which are deemed to be material to our 

stakeholders through various stakeholders’ engagement channels and materiality assessment. This sustainability report will be delineating the key 

sustainability topics on Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) issues which are crucial to our stakeholders, namely Economic performance, Anti- 

corruption, Energy, Employment, Customer Privacy and Local Communities.  

 The Board of Directors provides guidance on the development of sustainable business strategies and continuously reviews the effectiveness of the 

implementation of strategies across different functions of the operations. Certain sustainable goals are set in this respect. We seek to identify 

opportunities for improvement to our sustainability approach and management through this report. We are making an effort to integrate sustainability 

factors in formulating our strategies and across our business operations and wherever possible. 

We would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders, business partners, the management, employees and all stakeholders for your continuous 

support in our sustainable journey.

membership of

interests of the Singapore business community in the areas of 

trade, investment and industrial relations. It represents the

At TLV Holdings, we are committed to sourcing high-quality diamonds with integrity. Suppliers of our major materials such as diamonds and gold are 

carefully assessed and selected suppliers based on a, expertise, quality and past performance.  

Purchasing policy is in place to provide guidelines and control principles at various stages of the procurement process including selection, comparison 

and periodic evaluation of suppliers. Our bold pricing policy relies on the three key factors of competitive proﬁt margins, bulk purchasing power and a 

short supply chain with no middle man. In other words, we maintain competitive proﬁt margins; we buy quality diamonds in bulk and pass on the 

savings to our customers; and because we are also a manufacturing jeweller, we make our own pieces rather than source them.  

We are devoted to sourcing raw materials in an ethical and environmentally responsible manner while ensuring highest end product quality at 

remarkably affordable prices to our customers.

material topics

The core of our business is to create positive economic value and provide long-term sustainable ﬁnancial growth to our 

shareholders. Despite the competitive business environment, revenue and proﬁt remained stable in FY 2018 and to thank our 

shareholders for their continuous support, the Group had paid the ﬁrst and ﬁnal tax-exempt dividend of 0.219 Singapore cents per 

share. Currently, the Group does not have a formal dividend policy, nonetheless, the Group aims to distribute dividend attributable 

to shareholders depending on the ﬁnancial performance of the Group.  

The Group continuously monitor and analyse market trend and consumer behaviours to improve our products and services to 

adapt to the fast changing consumer market. The Group also participated in more than 20 international jewellery exhibitions every 

year including the HKTDC Hong Kong International Jewellery Show, Baselworld in Switzerland and Dubai International Jewellery 

Week, where we meet and connect with our global customers who are retailers, wholesalers and traders who attend these 

exhibitions. Through these interactions and feedback, we gained new perspectives and better understanding of market trends 

and consumer preferences.

The Board, supported by the AC, is responsible for the 

governance of risk. A comprehensive set of internal controls for 

key operation processes have been put in place to address 

ﬁnancial, operational, compliance risks and information 

technology (“IT”) risks. The effectiveness of these controls is 

subjected to independent audit from time to time and 

subjected to the review of the Group’s management and 

Board of Directors.  

The Group has put in place an Anti-Money Laundering 

framework, which includes reporting suspicious cash 

transactions to the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Ofﬁce of 

the Commercial Affairs Department of Singapore. New 

wholesale customers are required to provide their information 

to us as part of our know-your-client process and we also 

conduct reputation checks on our new wholesale customers. 

The Group also monitors any unusual cash transactions with 

new and existing customers on an ongoing basis. 

Code of Ethics which underlines the business conduct and 

behaviour of all employees has been established and 

communicated to all employees. It describes the importance of 

protecting the interest of the Group and safeguarding sensitive 

and conﬁdential information as an employee of the Group. 

Employees are expected to strictly abide to the code and act in 

a responsible and professional manner in the course of work. 

The Group has also established a robust process of 

identiﬁcation, evaluation, review, approval and reporting of 

interested person transactions. Conﬂict of Interest Policy has 

been adopted and communicated to all key management 

staff. All key management staffs are required to make conﬂict 

of interests annually or as and when necessary. 

Corporate Governance, Ethics, 

Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery  

In our call to advocate good governance within the Group, we 

have also formalised and established a Whistleblowing Policy 

for our employees and external parties who have dealings with 

the Group. A whistleblowing channel which is accessible 24/7 

has been set up for employees, shareholders, stakeholders and 

the public to raise concerns and feedbacks about any 

irregularities, impropriety, non-compliances or wrongdoings by 

management of staff in the course of their work. All concerns 

raised are reviewed by the Audit Committee (“AC”) at its 

quarterly meetings to ensure independent investigation and 

adequate resolution.

For further details of the Group’s Corporate Governance 

structure, kindly refer to our FY2018 Annual Report. 

The Group is pleased to announce that no conﬁrmed 

incidents of corruption and wrongdoings involving the 

Group’s employees or business in FY 2018. There were 

also no legal cases of corruption brought against the 

Company in the same ﬁnancial year. We aim to maintain 

this record in the upcoming year. 

The Group is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance to ensure accountability and transparency in conducting our business and to protect 

our shareholder’s interests. We have complied with the principles and guidelines set out in the Code of Corporate Governance 2012, the disclosure guide developed by 

the SGX-ST in January 2015 and the SGX-ST listing rules, where applicable. 








Energy

The Group places great emphasis on minimising its business impact on the environment. The Group’s primary 

environmental footprint is f rom electricity where it is used for lightning and air-conditioning in all our outlets 

and off ices. 

 The Group is currently monitoring energy utilisation rates and is taking conscientious efforts to conserve 

electricity. During the year, the Group’s head off ice had consumed about 148.4 mWh of energy and its outlets 

had consumed about 428.8 mWh of energy. The average energy consumption of each Taka outlet was 

26.7 mWh while the average energy consumption of each Top Cash outlet was 26.9 mWh. 

The Group approaches to energy management through creating employees awareness to encourage them to 

turn off the lights, air-conditioning and off ice equipment in off ices when they are not in use. The Group has 

also replaced conventional lights to lower energy consumption LED lights. 

As the Group targets to open new outlets in the coming year, the Group will continue to monitor and try to 

maintain its energy intensity at equal or below FY 2018 average energy intensity per outlet and in head off ice 

whilst upholding our energy conservation initiatives moving forward. 





15






We are mindful of contributing back to the communities that we operate in. 

Community investment and development not only enhances our business presence, 

increase brand awareness and boosts our business reputation but most importantly, 

we also strive to play our part to enhance social well-beings. 

The Group has been encouraging the management and employees to participate in 

the Children’s Society fundraising event - Walk for Our Children for 3 consecutive 

year. We also took up a carnival booth at the event to further help in raising funds. All 

proceeds were donated to the Children’s Society. 

We are proud to play a part in helping to better the lives of beneﬁciaries and will 

continue our support in the years ahead.

Customer’s information and personal data may be collected during the course of business 

for various purposes. We recognise the importance of protecting the privacy our 

customers.  

We strictly comply with the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”) Policy and 

regularly review the effectiveness of our control on customer data collection and handling 

processes. The collection and subsequent usage of customers’ information are required to 

be clearly communicated to customers and documented consent from customers to be 

obtained prior to the use of data collected. We did not divulge or sell personal information 

to third parties for marketing or promotional purposes. 

We are pleased to announce that there was no incident of loss of customers’ data and no 

report of breaches of customer privacy in FY 2018 and we will strive to maintain this record.

The Group is only as strong as its employees, as the success of TLV Holdings is driven by 

its talented and dedicated employees. The Group strives to create and promote diversity 

and inclusion workplace for its employees because we believe that each of our 

employees can make a unique contribution to the Group.  

We recognise each employee’s knowledge and skills as an important source of 

organisational capability and competitive advantage. Employees at all levels are 

provided with a variety of training and development opportunities. We also care for our 

employees’ well-being and work-life integration. We provide comprehensive beneﬁts to 

our employees such as Statutory contributions to Employees Provident Fund (“EPF”), 

hospitalisation leave, health care, parental and childcare leave.  

The Group supports the government’s pro-family policy and follows MOM regulations 

with regards to parental leave. 24 female employees and 17 male employees were 

entitled to parental leave in FY 2018. 21 female employees and 15 male employees 

returned to work after parental leave ended and were still employed 12 months after 

their return to work. The return to work and retention rates of employees that took 

parental leave was 87.5% for female employees and 88.23% for male employees. 

We adopt performance-based recognition where employees collaborate with their 

supervisors to set KPIs for the year. Performance review is conducted annually to 

appraise outcomes and identify development opportunities. We extend our appreciation 

to our employees by offering competitive compensation packages and also reward for 

their contributions during the annual Dinner and Dance. 

As of 31 March 2018, there was a total of 147 employees under the Group. All our 

employees are full time employees and 66% of our employees are hired from the local 

community. The staff retention rate was 78% in FY 2018.
