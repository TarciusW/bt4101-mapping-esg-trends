to do to embrace different thinking to drive innovation and 

problem solving. 

Our people network groups* have worked hard to build 

awareness and inclusion of key groups within our business. 

And this hasn’t gone unnoticed. Kuumba (our people network 

group for Black employees) and Women of Worley network 

both won GRIT awards1 for leading by example in the 

energy sector. 

We value Life and believe in the safety, health and well-being 

of our people, communities and the environment. Without it, 

nothing else matters.

We’ve stayed focused on our people’s mental and physical 

well-being as the world has moved in and out of COVID-19 

related lockdowns. We’ve provided basic mental health 

training to 875 managers, and we now have a network of over 

254 trained mental health champions. Our senior leaders 

actively lead our safety and well-being agenda, supported by 

tools including our Employee Assistance Program (EAP).

As the 26th UN Conference of the Parties (COP26) approaches, 

we’re reminded of the vital role the UN plays in coordinating 

the global effort on common issues facing humanity. It’s been 

nine years since we became a signatory to the UN Global 

Compact principles, and we’re more committed than ever to 

them as well as advancing the broader UN SDGs.

CEO MESSAGE

Taking action to forge sustainable pathways

The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us how fragile we are and how dependent we are on shared purpose 

and commitment. It’s also helped the world realize we need to take urgent action to achieve the United Nations 

Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). The enormity of the task is becoming ever more clear.

Delivering a more sustainable world

Ambitions, targets and agreements are important. 

But delivering the projects necessary to achieve a more 

circular economy, net zero emissions and better results for our 

societies and economies is where change becomes real and 

ambition is realized. It’s where action needs to exist and where 

Worley is taking a leadership role. 

Achieving net zero emissions by mid-century will demand 

an unprecedented pace and scale of global energy, chemical 

and resource infrastructure development and engineered 

solutions. It will require the balancing of project delivery 

performance with social and environmental values and the 

achievement of schedules.

This year we continued to deliver the solutions our customers 

need, including projects using carbon-negative technologies 

(such as direct air capture and bioenergy with carbon 

capture and storage), advancing the circular economy for 

plastics and supporting the development and scaling of 

hydrogen technology.

We continue with a focus on caring for our people, our planet 

and communities and operating responsibly. We’re bringing 

our purpose to life across our business in many ways. In the 

last year, we:

• introduced our Sustainable Solutions approach to delivering 

the work we do, empowering our people to reduce carbon 

levels on projects

• joined the Business Ambition* for 1.5°C, and the Science 

Based Targets initiative and committed to net zero 

Scope 3 emissions by 2050

• held our first Sustainability month, with 15,000 participants

• conducted the first global inclusion survey of our people, 

with more than 18,500 participants 

• participated in the Workplace Pride benchmark survey and 

signed onto the Workplace Pride Declaration of Amsterdam*

• developed digital sustainability solutions for carbon capture, 

zero emissions, hydrogen and renewables projects and 

disaster management.

Partnerships for breakthrough thinking

Solving the sustainability challenges facing the world requires 

new and different partnerships and coalitions to catalyze 

breakthrough thinking and approaches. This past year, we:

• partnered with the Princeton Andlinger Center for Energy 

and the Environment and created our first joint thought 

leadership on delivering net zero by 2050

• became the first Engineering, Procurement and 

Construction (EPC) company to join the Blockchain for 

Energy (B4E) consortium in the US to bring efficiency gains 

across the energy ecosystem

• participated in the Energy Transitions Commission industry 

coalition and contributed our expertise and perspective to 

its work

• became a foundation member of the Climate Leaders 

Coalition* in Australia.

Empowering our people

One of Worley’s key strengths is our agility and ability to 

lead in the face of external forces and shifts. The pandemic 

has enabled us to unlock brilliance wherever it lies within 

our organization and apply that talent and innovation to 

solve our customers’ complex challenges as they pivot their 

own businesses.

We learned from our first global inclusion survey that 91% of 

our people rated ‘excellent’ for “feeling comfortable to be my 

authentic self at Worley.” We also learnt we have more work

As economies begin to recover from the COVID-19 

pandemic, we all need to focus on sustainable development. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a shift in the way 

governments, companies, non-governmental organizations 

(NGOs) and communities collaborate to solve sustainability 

issues. We’ve seen nations partner across sectors to battle 

the impact of the virus, speed up vaccine development and 

get help to those most in need.

Stakeholder capitalism is becoming even more important. 

It’s driving more investment in companies with strong 

environment, social and governance (ESG) performance, 

and demand for internationally consistent ESG disclosures. 

The world is primed for vast low-carbon infrastructure 

development and requires collaboration to achieve this.

These shifts have created new partnership models which 

we must maintain with a focus on sustainable development 

if we’re to achieve the UN SDGs by 2030.

The race to zero is gathering pace

As COP26 approaches, the majority of economies 

have lifted their ambitions. The US has rejoined the 

Paris Agreement*, and Japan, Korea and China have 

committed to net zero emissions targets around the middle 

of this century. Many countries and blocs have significantly 

increased their short and medium term carbon reduction 

targets. And our customers are committing to net zero too.

The UK has also signaled a focus on biodiversity at 

COP26 in November, which will follow the 15th meeting 

of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on 

Biological Diversity in October 2021.

To achieve net zero ambitions, we’ll need innovative 

approaches to delivering projects and infrastructure. 

One way to do this is through new and different 

partnerships and coalitions across geographies, 

sectors and supply chains.

Now more than ever, it’s imperative that industries 

partner to make clear progress toward net zero.

GLOBAL CONTEXT

Partnerships for the future

This is the decade of action. We’ll all need to collaborate if society is to realize the UN SDGs by 2030.

Now more than ever, it’s imperative 

that industries partner to make clear 

progress toward net zero.

DECARBONIZATION

We are helping our customers to decarbonize

The energy transition requires an ecosystem of approaches 

and affects our customers across all our sectors.

The dual challenge of supplying energy to a growing 

population while addressing the risks of climate 

change is complex, and we’re helping our customers 

find the solutions. 

We are integrating our expertise in reducing 

GHG emissions (decarbonization) across the energy, 

chemicals and resources sectors.

For example, we have deployed our offshore project 

execution experience from oil and gas to wind power 

projects. We have brought our experience in pipeline, 

terminal and storage facilities from natural gas to hydrogen 

facilities. We’re using our knowledge of petroleum refining 

to create green refineries using renewable feedstock. 

We’re helping our customers use less and cleaner 

energy. We’re bringing energy transition metals to 

market faster to meet growing demand, and we’re using 

renewable energy to do it. 

Electrification is central to the energy transition

By replacing processes heavy in fossil fuels with low 

or zero emissions electricity, we can decarbonize many 

hard to abate industries.

We’re bringing our experience in power to other sectors 

– from Mining, Minerals and Metals (MMM) to Refining 

and Chemicals, and Upstream and Midstream.

We’re working with Phillips 66 to reconfigure its San Francisco refinery 

to produce renewable fuels.

The project will reconfigure the refinery and produce up to 650 million gallons per year of renewable 

transportation fuels from used cooking oils, fats, greases and vegetable oils. Once built, the renewable 

fuels facility is expected to be one of the world’s largest facilities of its kind.

We’re providing the overall engineering services and Advisian, our consulting business, completed

Making energy cleaner and smarter

We’re making renewable energy more reliable. To do this 

we are designing and delivering technologies including: 

• battery storage

• hydrogen

• pumped hydro

• thermal storage

• mechanical storage.

We eliminate energy waste by improving industrial 

processes and through rigorous master planning. 

We capture and use waste heat. And we change industrial 

processes to be more energy-input flexible, including 

to renewable energy.

We work on smarter demand and supply matching, 

using digitization across generation, grids and loads 

to optimize energy use.

Metals will build our future energy system

If the world is to meet its sustainability targets, 

more copper, nickel, lithium, cobalt and low-carbon 

aluminium is needed. 

The energy transition has huge implications for the 

mining industry. The supply gap for energy transition 

metals is widening. We are working with our MMM 

customers to reduce this gap through project delivery 

and technology improvements.

We are also supporting our customers in achieving 

more sustainable and efficient production of these 

valuable natural resources.

Meeting the challenge of scale and pace

Working alongside Princeton University, we have explored 

what it will take to deliver net zero by mid-century. 

To achieve the scale and pace necessary, a new way of 

thinking is needed. We are proposing five key shifts in how 

to think about and approach projects. These are:

• broaden how we think about value

• keep our technology options open

• design one, build many

• communicate and collaborate

• enable and monitor digitally.

In 2020, 62.3% of the energy produced 

in the US was wasted as heat or 

through various inefficiencies.5

Working behind the meter

With the VECKTA platform (our joint venture with Xendee), we 

help customers design and implement their custom microgrid 

solutions. We take our customers’ energy data and look at it in 

conjunction with our platform energy data. Then, using digital 

tools like artificial intelligence (AI), we help customize microgrid 

design and optimize operations.

Hydrogen will help decarbonize hard to 

abate industries

Hydrogen is a clean-burning fuel. It can be used as 

energy storage for renewables and as a decarbonization 

solution for hard to abate sectors like heavy transport, 

chemicals and steel manufacture. 

We are bringing our experience from safe production and 

export facility design to the emerging hydrogen industry.

We have the expertise to produce it, transport it, store it, 

process it and use it; all safely. 

We are delivering projects across the world, examining 

hydrogen’s role in the energy transition. 

In the Netherlands, we are completing the FEED of a hydrogen 

project which will see the green hydrogen produced used to 

create bio-methanol and green jet fuel. We are completing 

studies on the feasibility of crude oil to hydrogen pathways in 

the Middle East. In the UK, we are supporting a customer to 

engineer and integrate a 100MW green hydrogen plant.

In Australia, we are exploring the feasibility of turning green 

hydrogen into green ammonia, to help decarbonize an 

element of the mining supply chain.

Case Study | Hydrogen from wind

Our engineering services are helping Shell to 

develop a new 200MW green hydrogen plant

We have been awarded an early engineering services contract by Shell to support the 

development of a new 200 megawatt electrolysis-based hydrogen plant.

Once complete, the project will be one of the largest commercial green hydrogen production facilities 

in the world. 

As a first-of-its-kind project on this scale, we are providing early engineering and asset integration related 

services including the selection of the best technology needed to support the overall business case.

Natural gas in a low‑carbon world

To achieve net zero ambitions by mid-century, the carbon 

footprint of natural gas must reduce. We are helping to 

decarbonize the natural gas value chain through: 

• Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS)

• energy efficiency

• fugitive emissions management 

• electrification.

For example, fugitive emissions from natural gas facilities 

and pipelines are a significant problem due to the high 

global warming potential of methane. Our FetCH4 

technology enables our customers to detect and 

mitigate fugitive methane emissions. It’s quicker, more 

effective and safer than the usual periodic inspections 

carried out manually.

DECARBONIZATION

When it comes to decarbonizing 

the world’s energy systems, there 

isn’t one single solution. That’s why 

we’re helping customers across all of 

our sectors to make changes, as we 

remain focused on delivering a more 

sustainable energy future.”

Case Study | Improving the use of natural gas

We’re helping Saudi Aramco reduce flaring 

from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions*

We’ve provided engineering, procurement and project management services for the project. 

The project focused on optimizing gas utilization to meet the demand for power generation in Saudi Arabia’s 

gas supply. 

The solution involved creating gas injection facilities to store surplus gas from the master gas system (MGS) in 

underground, depleted reservoirs during low demand season and produce the gas back to MGS during the high 

demand season.

The countdown to negative carbon emissions

To achieve net zero by mid-century, technologies that remove CO2 from the atmosphere are likely to 

be required. Direct air capture (DAC) and bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) are two 

pioneering negative emissions technologies to strip carbon from the air and lock it away permanently. 





Withdrawing CO2 from the air

We’ve been awarded the initial engineering phase of 1PointFive’s first DAC facility, the world’s first million-tonne Direct Air Capture 

plant when fully built out.8

The facility, to be built in the US Permian Basin by 1PointFive, a wholly-owned 

subsidiary of Occidental, is the first commercial scale deployment of Carbon 

Engineering’s DAC technology, which captures carbon dioxide (CO2) directly from the 

atmosphere. This front end engineering design (FEED) phase will focus on the first 

phase of DAC-1, which is expected to capture 500,000 metric tonnes of CO2 annually. 

During the FEED phase, we’ll help 1PointFive explore next-generation technology, 

materials and manufacturing approaches consistent with a circular economy. 

These innovations will contribute to the facility’s sustainability and capital efficiency, 

and will allow Worley to work with 1PointFive and Carbon Engineering to refine the 

design and construction of future DAC facilities.  Completion of the FEED is estimated 

in the second quarter of 2022, after which we anticipate the project will move into the 

engineering, procurement and construction phase.

Case Study | Negative emissions

Capturing 8 million tonnes of CO2 with 

Drax Group

We’re working on the early front-end engineering and design 

(pre-FEED) for the first two carbon capture units at Drax Group’s 

power station in North Yorkshire, UK. Each unit is expected to 

capture approximately 4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. 

The carbon capture units will incorporate the negative emissions process 

scheme, BECCS which generates renewable electricity while permanently 

removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

We’re developing the plant layout, cost estimates and schedules for FEED and 

detailed engineering, procurement and construction. We’ll also explore options 

to integrate the project into the existing Drax site at an industrial scale.

Drax Group expects this to lead to the power station becoming carbon-negative 

and contribute to Humber region's ambition to be the UK’s first zero-carbon 

industrial cluster. It also has the potential to inspire future decarbonization 

projects from adjacent industries.

The world is on a journey to 

a circular economy

Half of all GHG emissions and more than 90% of 

biodiversity loss and water stress come from extracting 

and processing resources.9

Circular economies provide the solution to more 

sustainable resource use. 

Our work with our customers spans the opportunities 

defined in the waste management hierarchy. We strive 

to move towards avoiding waste and a fully circular 

reuse of materials.

We must reuse what we already have

We help our customers re-purpose their existing assets 

to make a more sustainable product. For example, 

we’re working with our existing customers in Europe, 

North America and Asia to convert their petroleum 

refineries to renewable diesel refineries by changing to 

biomass feedstocks.

There is only one planet Earth, yet by 2050, the 

world will be consuming as if there were three.”

We’re giving waste plastic a new life 

We’ve been awarded the engineering, procurement and construction management 

(EPCM) contract by SABIC Plastic Energy Advanced Recycling BV (SPEAR) – a joint venture 

between SABIC and Plastic Energy – for a new advanced plastics recycling unit in Geleen, 

the Netherlands.

The unit will leverage Plastic Energy’s patented recycling technology to transform mixed and used plastic 

waste, otherwise destined for incineration or landfill, into recycled oils called TACOIL. The TACOIL will then 

be used by SABIC as an alternative feedstock to manufacture certified circular polymers as part of its 

TRUCIRCLETM portfolio of solutions.

The advanced recycling unit will enable SABIC to upscale the production of these circular polymers 

significantly. This will provide customers with greater access to more sustainable materials, which are 

recycled and repurposed in a way that can help protect our planet’s natural resources.

While the world can now easily 

electrify trucks and cars, liquid 

fuels are still essential for most 

shipping and aviation. We are 

developing low-carbon fuels 

for our customers.

Sustainable hydrocarbons

Biofuel can replace oil. It’s made from waste and 

on-purpose biomass (from either plants or animals) 

rather than fossil fuel. 

We are working with our customers to select 

sustainable pathways for the production of 

biofuels*. We are also delivering over 60% of the 

refinery conversions to biofuels in the US. 

Turning waste into fuel

The first step in the journey to resource re-use 

is energy recovery. We are working with our 

customers to use methane from landfill or 

animal waste to make renewable natural gas 

and bioethanol.

We’re turning municipal solid waste into 

sustainable transportation fuels. For example, we 

are working with a customer to convert waste to jet 

fuel. Not only will this project produce sustainable 

fuel for the aviation industry, it will prevent the 

waste from going to landfill. 

Fuel from emissions and renewable energy

We’re using technology to produce synthetic fuels, 

made from captured CO2 and green hydrogen. 

For example, we are providing the engineering 

services on a project that recycles carbon-rich gas 

into bioethanol.

Water stewardship

Water is a critical resource. Water scarcity, 

competition for resources and environmental 

pressures including climate change are posing new 

challenges to our customers’ businesses and the 

broader community.

Working to increase water reliability

We help our customers with all aspects of 

responsible water management, including 

extraction, treatment, recycling and discharge. 

We’ve developed solutions for all types of 

operations including:

• wastewater treatment

• desalination

• onshore upstream

• green hydrogen

• unconventional oil and gas 

• the chemicals industry.

We make the fuels of the future and manage 

sustainable water use

Case Study | Water and green hydrogen

Ensuring a sustainable water 

supply for green hydrogen

We’ve been working with the Gigastack Consortium10 on 

the engineering for a 100MWe green hydrogen plant from 

wind energy for integration into a nearby refinery.

To create green hydrogen you need pure water – and a lot of it. 

In a fresh water constrained world, this can make or break a green 

hydrogen project. This was the challenge faced by our industrial water 

team and one of our customers when tasked to find a water source in 

the UK’s Humber region.

 The water source will be the recycled refinery effluent. The green 

hydrogen will displace carbon intensive grey hydrogen or be used as a 

zero carbon fuel to reduce carbon emissions. 

Using sustainable water sources such as recycled refinery effluent 

will make sure that we minimize the water footprint of the green 

hydrogen plant.

Built to last

As we experience more extreme weather, 

our energy infrastructure needs to be 

more resilient. 

We undertake studies and advise on the 

impacts of climate change, including sea 

level rise and coastal erosion. As part of 

our design practices, we also make sure 

infrastructure can withstand increased 

ambient temperature and more frequent 

extreme weather events.

For example, we included the impact of 

climate change (sea level rise, permafrost 

changes, ice loading levels) on the design 

of a port in the Arctic Circle.

We build climate change resilience into our 

design processes, future proofing critical 

infrastructure. Over the past 40 years we 

have improved the sustainability of assets 

on more than 25,000 projects.

Through digital we trust and deliver

We need the trust and auditability that 

only digital can deliver. Digital solutions 

will transform and impact how we design, 

deliver and operate infrastructure. 

Digitally enabled Distributed Energy 

Systems (DES) help keep energy 

infrastructure resilient. They increase 

survival time during a grid outage and 

reduce the vulnerability of the energy 

supply if a single critical location is 

damaged. DES also reduce costs, save 

energy and help to increase uptake 

of renewable energy.

We are using the Advisian Carbon Risk Index Service (ACRIS), a subscription-based 

service that gives our customers a dynamic risk related index number which updates 

in response to transition and climate related risk events. We give our subscribers 

access to a suite of tools and reports providing mitigation pathways, cost information

of a project’s development.

Technology’s role in reducing our 

customers’ impact 

Our technologies go beyond 

minimizing GHGs.

Through Comprimo (our sulphur recovery

When we help our customers 

decommission their sites, we do it 

in a way which minimizes social and 

environmental impacts and creates 

future ecosystem services. 

Our key considerations when we are 

planning a restoration include:

Leaving a positive legacy

We add value to the world while protecting the planet 

and delivering benefits shared by society. 

How can we achieve the most 

sustainable outcome?

Which vegetation species should

Balancing value and economics to promote community sustainability

For us, value means making a lasting positive social impact 

and contributing to the communities in which we operate. 

We are committed to supporting sustainable communities 

and maximizing opportunities for local participation and 

benefit sharing.

We support our customers to increase local and 

First nations employment and supply chain participation. 

Our award-winning Advisian Society, Governance and 

Engagement team has had staff consistently working 

with the government and industry to facilitate meaningful 

local participation. 

We work collaboratively with our customers to deliver the 

full spectrum of social performance outcomes – including: 

• community and landholder relations

• First nations engagement and partnerships

• public communications

• local content

• social risk and impact assessment

• social impact management

• social investment

• sustainable development.

For example, we recently supported a top energy customer 

in driving recruitment of over 400 First nations roles for 

one of its Australian assets, and maintaining an almost 

90% retention rate of First nations employees. This was 

achieved through embedding an First nations support 

services team within the customer’s organization. We also 

influenced this customer to significantly increase their 

direct spend with First nations businesses. 

We are also working with various governments to advise on 

stakeholder engagement and social impact management in 

relation to renewable energy developments.

We’ve lowered the carbon footprint 

of our Houston office

Our Houston office is one of our largest offices. This year, we reduced its carbon 

footprint by:

• switching our lighting to LEDs

• upgrading our air conditioning system to high efficiency chillers and air handlers 

• installing motion sensors in the bathrooms 

• switching our vending machines to sleep mode to reduce energy consumption.

We also took part in Earth Hour on the 27th March 2021. From 8:30 to 9:30pm, 

we switched off all outdoor lighting and non-essential indoor lights in our 

Houston office.

As well as improving our energy efficiency, we have switched to 100% renewable 

electricity by purchasing Renewable Energy Certificates. This reduced our annual 

Scope 2 emissions by over 5,000 tCO2e*.

Our GHG reduced significantly in FY2021. This was 

due to a combination of factors. Some reductions will 

be sustained into the future, for example where we 

have switched offices to renewable energy and where 

we have made permanent changes to our leased floor 

area. Some reductions will be temporary as a result of 

changed operating patterns, such as inability to travel 

internationally and working from home, due to the 

COVID-19 pandemic.

Our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions fell dramatically due 

to reduced occupancy of most offices and permanent 

reductions in leased floor space. 

The increase in the number of our people working from 

home means that our emissions have been affected in 

Scope 3 Category 7: Employee Commuting. We’ll work to 

quantify these emissions in FY2022 and explore options 

to reduce.

and long term, in line with the climate-related risks 

and opportunities we identify.

• Using climate-related scenarios is a core part of our 

strategy development process. We use three of the 

IEA scenarios in our strategy and planning processes to 

cover the different possible speeds of the transition to 

a low-carbon economy. Described more fully in Table 1 

these are:

• the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) 

as our primary scenario 

• the IEA’s Net Zero Economy by 2050 Scenario 

(NZE2050) to represent an accelerated transition

• the IEA’s Stated Policy Scenario (STEPS) to inform 

a slower transition.

• Our R3 group supports us in maintaining business 

continuity and planning responses in the event of 

physical risks like extreme weather events and 

rising temperatures.

We seek solutions that leave a positive legacy

WATER, CIRCULAR ECONOMY &amp; BIODIVERSITY

As part of our Field Services businesses, we have 10 fabrication and modularization yards across North America, 

Europe and the UK. Within these businesses we fabricate and assemble equipment such as piping, structural 

and process modules. 

In FY2022, we will develop a plan to reduce our 

water and waste impact at our fabrication yards

Next year, we’ll expand data collection in our 

fabrication yards. By better understanding our different 

wastes we will improve our re-use and recycling rates. We 

already track a lot of recycling streams in our Rosenberg 

fabrication yard in Norway – including organic waste, 

cardboard/paper, wood, plastic, and metal.

We’ll expand our reporting to cover water usage 

and waste from our offices 

This applies to all our owned or leased offices where our 

water usage and waste is metered. 

This year, we updated our property leasing criteria to 

include considerations on waste separation and reduction 

and water efficiency. We’ll continue working with our 

property managers to improve the ways we measure and 

reduce our water usage.

This year, we began to track and report the water and 

waste generated from our fabrication yards.

The water consumption in our Houston fabrication yard 

was unusually high this year, because during the severe 

winter storms in Texas in February, our water lines were 

kept running continuously for several days. This was to 

prevent the lines from freezing.

What does biodiversity mean to Worley?

Biodiversity loss is a sustainability issue of 

elevating importance. Habitat destruction, pollution 

and climate change are all putting increasing 

pressure on global biodiversity.

We are changing the way we run our business to 

consider not just our impact on climate but how 

we can retain and improve biodiversity where we 

operate. We are continuing to clarify and strengthen 

our consideration of ESG issues in our supply chain.

In Latin America we’re having a positive impact in 

the Araguaia biodiversity corridor which connects 

two of the world’s most vital ecosystems: the 

Amazon rainforest and the Cerrado savanna.

We’ve partnered with our fleet supplier, Movida 

and the Black Jaguar Foundation to help reforest 

the corridor with native seedlings. This will help 

save thousands of species, converting agricultural 

land back to the original state of the rainforest and 

savanna. It will also sequester enough carbon to 

offset our vehicle fleet emissions in Brazil.

We are committed to the safety, health and well-being of our people, 

communities and the environment

We prioritize the safety, health and well-being of ourselves and others, and we choose what is right 

over what is quick or easy. We face into important issues and understand and learn from them.

SAFETY, HEALTH AND WELL-BEING

Our Life approach underpins everything we do

Life is what connects us with each other and the 

programs and tools we use every day to stay safe 

and well. Life keeps front of mind the purpose 

of these programs and provides the connection 

between them, be it Life conversations, Life saving 

rules, Safe driving for Life, or Life matters.

The importance of having conversations is a 

foundation of our Life programs. It has been over 

a year since Life was introduced, and more than 

50% of our people surveyed report that it “made 

a positive impact and/or changed their work 

behavior”. This year we’ve continued building 

engagement through Mental Health month, our 

Safe start campaign, Safe driving for Life program, 

and Life month. We will carry on embedding Life as 

one of our core values.

SAFETY, HEALTH AND WELL-BEING

Our Life approach is underpinned by the concept 

of ‘Human Performance’

Human Performance is about the way people think about 

and perform their work. It’s a contemporary philosophy 

that’s gained significant traction during the past decade in 

areas of safety and leadership. 

Human Performance recognizes that:

• even the best make mistakes. It’s part of being human 

and so our systems need to be tolerant of this

• blame fixes nothing. Blame doesn’t create sustainable 

improvement. When things go wrong, we have to look 

forward, see where else we have similar circumstances 

and put the right prevention measures in place

• learning and improving is vital. And it needs to be 

deliberate. We need to ask better questions and really 

listen to the answers

• context influences behavior. Our work environments 

affect our behavior and actions. If we’re not achieving 

what we want to achieve, we should look at “what” is 

failing, rather than “who” is failing

• how you act and respond counts. People look for 

examples to follow, so everything you do is important.

We depend on these five building blocks to help us 

make sure we’re working safely and healthily in our 

day-to-day operations. These principles don’t tell us what 

to do - they simply help us to understand, evolve and find 

different and better ways of doing things.

Life helps us respond to the needs and demands of our ever-changing environment. Our people are the solution to 

getting more things right in varying conditions.

Keeping our people physically safe

We strive to increase the safety of our people under a broad range of scenarios.

We mandate the reporting of incidents and injuries so that 

we can continue to learn and reduce the risk of incidents. 

This year we:

We have had no fatalities over the past financial year.

As part of our Life approach, we are changing how we 

talk about and celebrate safety, health and well-being. 

We’re looking beyond statistics and frequency-rate 

milestones. As well as actively learning and improving 

when things go wrong, we also talk about and celebrate 

the things that go right - and activities that make a 

difference to safety outcomes.

We know how useful leading indicators are in helping us to 

manage risks on our projects. We are seeking to intervene 

early in particular work sites with the right resources and 

capability to avoid safety incidents. To help us we are 

trialing the use of multiple leading and lagging indicators.

 Promoted Life Conversations which 

continuously improves the quality 

of conversations around human 

performance and core Life behaviors. 

Launched our Safe Start campaign 

which equipped our people with the 

practical information on Life, its 

associated behaviors and examples 

of how we can all use them in our 

daily work.

Introduced the Safe driving for Life 

program which helps our people to

Building platforms for 

better mental health

We’re continuously emphasizing the importance of 

supporting mental health, and we have the programs 

and systems to make this happen. 

We have two programs that promote the importance of good mental health: 

Life Conversations and Life Matters. These programs include:

• a comprehensive EAP

• a robust network of mental health champions

• training materials

• a recognition program for role modeling safe behaviors 

• online resources that support creating a safe and respectful workplace. 

875 managers completed basic mental health awareness training. We now have 

254 trained and chartered mental health champions. We are seeking to have mental 

health champions in all our locations so that all our people have support locally.

SAFETY, HEALTH AND WELL-BEING

Case Study | Mental Health month

In September 2020, we had a month-long promotion of mental health 

which brought focus to its importance. We held four Leaders Talk Mental 

Health webinars across the business to share the experiences of our 

senior leaders and de-stigmatize conversations about mental health. We 

highlighted the importance of a healthy lifestyle, talked about mental 

health challenges and promoted our EAP.

Our CEO, Chris Ashton, shared his 

personal mental health story at a 

live session.

Improving our people’s 

social well-being

Stronger together is one of our values. Social well-being is always important. 

But with remote working and social distancing, it’s now more critical than ever. 

Our key achievements this year have included:

• introducing our Ice-breaker app which improves how we connect in 

the virtual world

• giving our people meaningful advice on staying connected whilst working 

from home during lockdown

• holding Life Conversations across the business to continually check-in on 

our people’s well-being

• establishing an appreciation program to celebrate achievements and support 

an inclusive culture for our people.

Case Study | Stronger together

Providing our people with top tools for social well‑being. 

Our Stronger together campaign provided an opportunity to promote our 

global experts, our diversity and inclusion and champion networks, and 

our networking and resourcing platform ION 4.0. We also promoted our 

networking tool, Ice-breaker, and all our other well-being resources.

Keeping our people safe in the face of COVID-19 

We continue to navigate the challenges of COVID-19.

We’ve stood beside our people as the virus has affected 

them in different ways – from the loss of loved ones to 

long periods of social isolation.

We've all seen the devastating impact COVID-19 has had. 

We are saddened by the loss of valued members of our 

Worley team. We express our deepest sympathy to the 

family and friends of all lives lost across the globe.

Our processes for managing COVID‑19 have 

helped to keep our people safe and shown our 

remarkable flexibility

Our management teams all over the world have 

worked tirelessly to care for the physical and mental 

well-being of our people. Our people continued to work 

over 72 million hours onsite to support our customers’ 

critical infrastructure projects.

We know the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will be felt 

for years to come. We’ll keep strengthening our mental 

health networks and support in response. We have assisted 

our people to work more comfortably from home, with 

full access to office equipment as required. Working from 

anywhere is now part of our new operating model. 

We’re giving guidance to our people to improve their 

safety, health and well‑being while working away 

from the office

Guidance includes Life saving rules at home, ergonomic tips 

and advice on networking in a virtual environment. 

As part of our Life program, we’ve given our people the 

information they need to make informed decisions as the 

pandemic has evolved and vaccines have started rolling out. 

We’re continuing to give regular updates on how our people 

are affected by the pandemic. And we have dedicated links 

for useful external resources.

We’ve been using new technology to help our 

customers in new ways 

The COVID-19 impacts on travel have created an 

opportunity to use technology and innovation to develop 

new tools for virtual site visits. This reduces risk and travel. 

Our Worley-developed technology has been so successful 

that it’s become a product offering for our customers. 

Our teams are working to design specialized camera-linked 

tools to make the process even better. 

SAFETY, HEALTH AND WELL-BEING

The safety, health and well-being of our people is what 

Life is all about. As the pandemic waves have impacted 

our people and their families across our operations, 

I am enormously proud of the care and support our 

people have provided each other and the flexibility our 

processes have enabled to maintain customer delivery.”

Fostering a culture of inclusion 

We’re building a culture where everyone is valued, respected and supported.

We have a holistic approach to diversity and 

inclusion (D&amp;I)*

This is based on our People, Culture and Market model. 

We’re proud of our progress this year but more needs to 

be done and we’ll keep delivering improvements, guided 

by feedback from our people.

We’re building an even stronger culture of diversity 

and inclusion

This year, we wanted to know what our people think 

of our workplace culture. We ran a global survey and 

set out to answer:

1. How diverse is the Worley family?

2. How included do our people feel?

Over 18,500 of our people responded and here is 

what they had to say:

Overall, our people said they see visible leadership on 

diversity and inclusion and generally experience inclusive 

behavior. In their day-to-day duties, they mostly find 

working and collaborating within the Worley team to be 

positive and rewarding. The results also showed that some 

segments of our workforce specifically felt less included. 

How we’re using these results to improve inclusion and 

belonging is spoken to on the next page. 

We are increasing support for specific groups

The survey showed us some groups still find working at 

Worley less inclusive. These include women, non-binary 

and transgender people, Black people, African people and 

African American people and those with a disability. During 

FY2022 we’ll do more work to understand how we can 

help these groups to experience being more included.

We’re improving the gender diversity of our team

We have a Board made up of 33% women and 

a gender-balanced executive team of six women 

and four men.*

We’ve recruited more women into senior leadership roles 

by having a more focused approach to talent acquisition. 

We have re-positioned our ambition on the general 

workforce, of which currently 18% are women. We will 

focus on initiatives that will develop inclusivity across the 

business as opposed to broad general workforce gender 

targets. We believe this will be more meaningful for the 

business and will bring about greater impact. It is our intent 

to identify a number of key drivers from our inclusion 

survey and measure progress accordingly. 

During the past year:

• 22% of our hires into Senior Leader roles were women

• 46% of our graduates starting during the year were 

women, up from 28% in FY2020.

We are tackling unconscious bias 

During FY2022, we will focus on tackling unconscious 

bias – and the ways it affects our business and people 

decisions. We’ll be doing a systematic review of core 

processes and decision-making structures. We’ll be 

looking for places where we can ‘hardwire’ ways of 

combating unconscious bias.

We’re benchmarking, certifying and communicating 

our work with the market

This year, our Pride@Worley network group took part in 

the Workplace Pride Global benchmark survey. We wanted 

to understand where we can improve our efforts to build an 

inclusive environment for our LGBTIQ+ people. We signed 

the Workplace Pride Declaration of Amsterdam which 

promotes inclusive corporate cultures for LGBTIQ+ people.

We took part in the GRIT Awards, with our Kuumba and 

Women of Worley network groups recognized for their 

work during FY2020.

Achieving racial equality

During FY2020, a global conversation about racial justice 

was sparked following the death of George Floyd in the 

US. The Black Lives Matter movement in the US catalyzed 

a global conversation about how businesses can increase 

and improve representation of different ethnicities. 

Worley responded by supporting our Kuumba network 

to expand and promote the importance of achieving 

racial equality across the business. 

Recognizing and respecting First Nations heritage 

We continued to work with First Nations people in the 

communities in which we operate - in Canada through 

the Progressive Aboriginal Relations Certification, and in 

Australia with our Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). 

As an Australian-based business, our RAP commitments 

and community partnerships demonstrate our 

commitment to Australia’s Reconciliation journey. 

Since our RAP launch we’ve deepened our relationships 

with the Polly Farmer Foundation and CareerTrackers 

Indigenous Internship Program and established new 

partnerships with the Johnathan Thurston Academy and 

Warrikal. We’ve declared our support of the principles 

embodied in the Uluru Statement from the Heart and 

continue to build awareness within our business on 

the meaning of Reconciliation as well as celebration of 

First Nations culture. 

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

An update on our FY2025 targets and progress

Through FY2021 we made progress and refined 

our targets.

We believe that our workplace should represent and 

reflect the communities in which we operate; this is 

especially true when it comes to the representation of 

race and ethnicity. 

Our aspiration is to progress more closely to this vision. 

We are now working to develop a global ambition 

around equality with location relevant targets.

Given our geographic spread and the fact that race 

and ethnicity issues vary by location, we believe this 

approach is more meaningful and relevant.

Case Study | Black Lives Matter

Our CEO, Chris Ashton, held group meetings 

and had more than 20 individual discussions 

with our Black employees, predominantly in 

the US, UK and South Africa.

We expanded our listening with larger 

facilitated group sessions, inviting all our 

Black employees to contribute and help us 

shape future actions. 

We aligned the outcomes of listening 

into current diversity and inclusion plans 

and added additional actions, such as 

establishing regional and senior sponsorship 

programs, creating two regional D&amp;I roles 

for the business and piloting race education 

programs in the US to address gaps. 

Kuumba doubled its membership in FY2021. 

We added three new chapters in Europe, 

Africa and APAC and appointed an additional 

executive sponsor. The network provides 

support for our people and connections to our 

wider diversity and inclusion work.

In the US, Kuumba has continued their 

work with historically Black colleges and 

universities (HBCUs), conducting development 

sessions and providing mentorship to 

students. Kuumba has run STEM programs 

in local high schools in Houston. In the UK, 

Kuumba hosted Black History Month for 

the first time. Globally, Kuumba launched a 

mentorship program to elevate and support 

Black talent in our business. We are proud 

that Kuumba was recognized by winning a 

GRIT award in the Teams/Affinity Groups 

Category (through Allyenergy.com).

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

We stopped and we listened� Then we acted� 

We have a significant presence in the US, and the events of 2020 gave us pause 

to stop and understand the challenges and themes of Black Lives Matter as 

experienced by our own people.

PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT

Our people are our  

most valuable asset

We focus on four priorities which guide us in 

developing our people:

We’re shaping the  

workforce of the future 

The nature of our work continues to change. 

We’re experimenting with new ways of working 

and new models for deploying our people.

Our Workforce of the Future program is focused on researching and 

identifying our workforce needs of the future. We are exploring the skills 

and capabilities we need to:

• serve our customers and deliver our strategy

• find and recruit the right talent in new and scalable ways

• redefine the purpose of the workplace and how and where work gets done.

PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT

We’re making sure our people are ‘future fit’, and we’re developing 

the leaders of tomorrow

To attract, upskill and retain the right people, we need to provide the right tools and working culture. 

We’re creating programs and opportunities that put our people at the center of the experience and help 

them develop the essential skills of the future.

Our approach includes:

• Learning at Worley - our platform hosting 

a comprehensive suite of digital learning 

tools to enable our people to focus on 

skills development

• Global Graduate Development Program

• a toolkit of programs developed and 

delivered by our learning specialists.

We’ve continued delivering learning 

materials virtually through FY2021, 

with over 212,000 visits to Learning at 

Worley this year.

We’ve delivered a range of 

development programs

We have:

• increased our ‘on the job’ 

learning opportunities

• delivered a series of team 

effectiveness programs

• developed a multi-level sponsorship 

program where senior leaders advocate 

to help accelerate opportunities for 

underrepresented groups. We have 

24 pairs of sponsors and protégés – with 

our Group Executive and senior leaders 

acting as sponsors

• held a series of focused months for 

educating, developing and engaging our 

people globally. These included Mental 

Health Month, Sustainability Month, 

Energy Transition Month and Our Values 

Month. We’ve had a total attendance of 

more than 75,000 at our live Teams calls 

over the past year

• started work implementing a series 

of development pathways to skill our 

people through an Energy Transition 

Passport. This will support our people 

as they pivot their careers and apply 

their skills to sustainability and 

Energy Transition projects.



Case Study | Digital Passport

We’re upskilling our people, working towards being part of a digitally 

driven company

An integral part of our strategy is the Digital Transformation which requires all 

our people to work towards embedding digital skills and technologies in the way 

they work, to improve efficiency, challenge the norm, embrace innovation and 

provide competitive edge.

To support this, the Digital Passport has been developed for all people within Worley 

to begin their digital journey. By completing the Digital Passport, each employee can 

develop their learning about how they can be part of our digital transformation and 

use digital skills and technologies in their own role to save time, be more efficient and 

be more valuable to Worley overall.

We’ve had over 11,700 of our people around the globe complete the Digital Passport 

since it was rolled out in August 2020. The value of learning digital tools and 

skills was clearly highlighted by the rapid adoption, with over 5,600 of our people 

completing the Passport in the first two months.

Building on its success, we are now introducing ‘Stamps’ that take a deeper dive 

into specific digital topics such as Data Science, AI and Data Literacy. As a result, 

our people can direct their own learnings to topics that are most relevant and useful 

to them.

PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT

We’re strengthening our 

employee experience

We’re delivering  

data-driven insights

Driven by data insights we are delivering targeted 

initiatives to develop our people.

Looking closely at data insights tells us a lot about our workforce 

demographics and our people experiences. This means we can make our 

initiatives more targeted and more effective.

We’re working on digitalizing and automating our people processes. 

Using aligned systems and shared services means we can use data insights 

to target areas of risk and growth.

Data is helping us to boost our diversity and inclusion

We focus our monthly recruitment reports on linking our actions to diversity 

and inclusion. We’ve been looking at gender in particular. This has helped 

us to highlight key steps in our recruitment process that we can improve to 

further our quest for a more diverse and inclusive workforce.

Our first inclusion survey is another example of a data-driven exercise that’s 

given us some very useful insights. It’s helping us to target specific ways 

we can improve the sense of inclusion and belonging for our people across 

the Worley group.

It’s crucial for us to develop leaders who understand their people and how 

to coach them. It’s one of the strongest influences in the experience of 

working at Worley.

At the end of FY2020, we introduced Worley’s purpose, values and behaviors. 

This gave us an opportunity to engage our people with our strategy and our 

expectations of our behaviors that we see as most important – for each 

other, our customers, partners and communities.

In the past year, we’ve:

• recruited 335 Values ambassadors to embed and steward our purpose and 

values throughout the business

• launched our ‘Appreciate’ values recognition program, providing an avenue 

to recognize and celebrate our people who demonstrate our values 

and behaviors

• held a series of values and purpose months to promote and cultivate 

our values within our people.

We’re introducing a Short Term Incentive (STI) framework for Senior Leaders 

that recognizes behaviors in line with our values. By linking our incentive 

programs not just to ‘what’ our leaders achieve but ‘how,’ we can accelerate 

to delivering a more sustainable world.

Our priority is to cultivate a values driven, inclusive 

culture which fosters belonging and well-being.

PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT

We’re embedding sustainability in the mindset of our people

We held our first Sustainability month; a call to action for all our people to take part in our sustainability journey. 



This is a pivotal moment in time for us, and the time for action is now. 

We kickstarted 2021 with Sustainability month for everyone to take part 

in our sustainability journey.” 

 

Our CEO Chris Ashton during Sustainability month

“

The month featured 25 webinars involving our CEO, our customers 

and our people. 

More than 15,000 of our people took part, creating meaningful 

conversations about sustainability across the business and giving 

insights into what our customers are doing and how to pivot 

their own careers.

Our Sustainability Champions Network (SCN) is growing

This network has been actively bringing our purpose to life and now 

has more than 500 members. The SCN connects people across the 

business who are passionate about sustainability. The group meets 

regularly to share leading developments in sustainability and to 

coordinate various initiatives. We have teams working on reducing 

our GHG emissions and advising us how to improve our homes’ 

sustainability performance.

The sustainability solutions of tomorrow need 

a STEM-literate generation today. 

We want to inspire the children of today to get involved with STEM fields for the 

opportunities they create. We’re working on this with organizations which share this 

common goal. Whether it is through skilled engineering outreach or projects funded 

by the Worley Foundation, our people are passionate about making a difference. 

Skilled volunteering

As technology providers, our people have a wealth of technical knowledge which 

they generously contribute as volunteers to causes close to their hearts. Through the 

Worley Foundation, we give our people the opportunities to apply their skills through 

volunteering. This year our people supported projects which progress toward 

achieving the UN SDGs. Some examples include the Pollinate Group in India, the 

Antarctic Science Foundation and the Centre for Affordable Water and Sanitation 

Technology (CAWST) in Colombia.

This funding has been allocated to a broad range of sustainability initiatives 

– from improving education in Colombia to empowering young Indigenous 

Australians.

Some of these contributions stem from an obligation to comply with 

South Africa’s Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment legislation 

requirements, as well as section 135 of India’s Companies Act, 2013, Companies 

(Corporate Social Responsibility Policy) Rules, 2014, to reinvest in communities.

Case Study | Respecting Indigenous heritage

We’re supporting positive change in both our projects and how we run our 

business. Examples include our:

• Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) in Australia

• Next Generation Outreach program in Canada

• school community involvement in Kazakhstan

• partnership with Norman Wells Land Corporation in Canada.

We have recently progressed our RAP program to increase our positive 

impact with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander owned businesses in 

our Australian operations.

We’ve delivered an engagement pack in the UK for both high school and 

primary school students, featuring our CEO, Chris Ashton. 

We are delivering this engagement pack to a range of schools in the UK, 

raising awareness of the benefits of STEM but also how important STEM is to 

achieving the UN SDGs.

Case Study | Centre for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology

 The approach of companies like 

Worley is brilliant; they bring 

commitment and engagement to 

the next level, not only talking about 

financial support to the cause but also 

involving their staff.”

Eva Manzano 

Senior Global WASH Advisor at CAWST

Skilled volunteering to provide fresh 

water and sanitation facilities

Access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation is a fundamental 

human right, and without it, progress towards other sustainable 

development goals is impossible. One in three people globally do not 

have access to safe drinking water, 4.2 billion lack access to safely 

managed sanitation and 3 billion lack basic handwashing facilities.18

“

18 World Health Organization, UNICEF, United Nations.

For more than three years the Worley Foundation 

has been supporting the Centre for Affordable 

Water and Sanitation Technology (CAWST) through 

financial contributions and skilled volunteering. 

COVID-19 pushed us to create new ways to connect 

and make a difference this year. 

We worked with CAWST to create and participate 

in the ‘Tippy Tap Challenge’, a collaborative 

challenge to create a suitable low-cost 

handwashing station for rural communities. 

The design solution can be implemented by 

CAWST’s clients and partners to improve 

access to handwashing facilities in remote 

communities of Colombia and contribute 

to COVID-19 mitigation efforts. 

A key part of empowering local communities is 

education, and we are now working with CAWST 

in supporting local organizations in building their 

technical knowledge and skills. This involves 

working in the virtual environment to support 

local practitioners with the implementation of 

household water treatment, sanitation and hygiene 

interventions and improving the living conditions of 

many local communities.

OUR ETHICS APPROACH

We have high expectations 

of ethical behavior

Our Code of Conduct

We have a responsibility to speak up and stand up 

for what is right.

Our Code of Conduct outlines our commitment to complying with the law 

and conducting business to the highest standards. The Code is available in 

16 languages and is supported by detailed procedures. In 2021, we commenced 

internal review and consultation program to update the Code of Conduct in 

anticipation of a FY2022 launch.

We have zero tolerance for bribery, fraud and corruption and prohibit 

facilitation payments. We continue to apply our Gifts, Entertainment, 

Hospitality (all ‘Gifts’) Standard which includes a strict protocol for registering 

gifts and entertainment.

Our Whistleblower Policy 

and Ethics Helpline

Our Ethics Helpline provides a platform for our 

people to report via phone or web at any time in 

any location. 

This helpline is also open to current and former employees, their families, 

suppliers, partners and customers. Over the last 12 months, our team 

responded to 188 reports and 56 were substantiated.

We’ve made our Ethics Helpline program more effective by improving training 

and tools for our investigators and strengthening our close-out process.

We ran a survey to gauge our people’s knowledge of the Ethics Helpline 

including their willingness to report a breach and their confidence in the 

reporting and investigation processes. The majority of respondents said 

they were aware of the Ethics Helpline and were confident in raising 

concerns through it.

Act 2015.

We fulfilled all our commitments in our modern slavery statement. 

We completed a detailed internal audit of our modern slavery program 

to ensure compliance with our modern slavery statement and we included 

awareness training in our latest annual Code of Conduct refresher training.

We are an active member of Building Responsibly and have committed 

to operating in line with its Worker Welfare Principles. We’ll leverage this 

membership to enhance our modern slavery program.

Leading supply chain improvements

We are embedding sustainability in our 

procurement practices.

Our Supply Chain Code of Conduct sets our expectations of suppliers, and it is 

actively applied by our procurement teams. The standards we expect of our 

suppliers are the same we expect of ourselves and cover the considerations of:

• governance and ethics

• human rights and fair employment

• health and safety 

 

• the environment

• supply chain

• community engagement. 

This year we conducted 5,532 supply chain due diligence checks. 

OUR ETHICS APPROACH

Ethical due diligence

We conduct due diligence on all our business 

relationships and tailor our approach depending 

upon the risk level and relationship. 

We have an internal team of due diligence analysts who support all areas 

of our program. They use third party research tools and external due 

diligence providers if they need extra expertize.

We’ve conducted over 8,500 ethical due diligence reviews in the 

last 12 months.

Worley undertakes a high level of due diligence before entering a relationship 

with sales agents and joint venture partnerships.

We’ve integrated our customer due diligence into our internal 

sales tool 

We’ve centralized alerts and have developed a clear communication protocol 

between our sales and due diligence teams to ensure early identification of red 

flags and the mitigation required. Where we find red flags, we always escalate 

and get specific approvals before submitting a bid.



Case Study | Requis

Our supplier registration tool, Requis, now includes 

an ethical assessment

This includes a risk screening, due diligence research (for 

medium and high risk suppliers) and review of their anti-

bribery and modern slavery prevention policies and training. 

Our procurement team use a separate screening tool for 

suppliers and contractors that are not registered on Requis. 

This tool includes a risk screening and due diligence research 

(for medium and high risk suppliers). More than 300 people 

across our procurement teams have been trained to use 

this tool. Our due diligence analysts provide coaching to our 

procurement teams to identify and understand red flags 

and develop mitigation strategies.

CYBER SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION

We ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information 

and have a robust cyber security program

We have a dedicated information security team supporting IT systems and services, led by our 

Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). 

Our Information Security Council (ISC) oversees our 

information security strategy and decision-making. This 

council includes our CISO, Chief Information Officer (CIO) 

and key business and IT leaders. Our Data Protection Office 

governs compliance of our cyber security program with the 

global data protection requirements of Australia, Europe 

and the US and elsewhere. During FY2021 we:

• achieved certification for our information security 

management system, meeting the requirements of 

ISO/ EC 27001:2013 

• integrated the IT systems of Energy, Chemicals and 

Resources division of Jacobs Engineering Group Inc to 

remove potential security threats related to this merger 

• expanded our Information Security Awareness program 

to our people and continued educating the importance of 

cyber security

• increased our protection capabilities against email fraud 

and look-alike phishing attacks 

• joined hands with our security partners to prepare and 

defend Worley to avoid the highly sophisticated and 

industry pervasive “SolarWinds Hack”. 



Case Study | Cyber security

We’ve transformed and adapted our IT systems 

to keep our people safe while working remotely 

The COVID-19 pandemic required a large proportion of our people to switch to remote working in a very 

short space of time.

We’ve adapted our cyber security controls to mitigate against new cyber risks using our existing cyber 

security capabilities to set up the new capacity and solutions we needed. 

This year, we enabled thousands of engineers across the world with high performance Graphic Processing 

Unit (GPU) requirements to work from home. We were able to use new Citrix components to support remote 

workstations with high GPU demand.

“

Preparation and adaptability are the secrets to success. We overcame 

new challenges to efficiently and securely continue productive operations 

for our people and customers.”

OUR RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS ASSESSMENT STANDARD

We assess our opportunities to bid using our 

Responsible Business Assessment Standard

We use our Responsible Business Assessment (RBA) Standard to inform which projects we bid for 

and execute. The RBA’s decision-making principles are embedded into our sales and risk management 

processes. This enables our people to better understand ESG risks and directs escalation of high risk 

projects to our senior business leaders and CEO.

We align our RBA Standard with our purpose of delivering 

a more sustainable world. For example, we carefully assess 

our involvement in carbon-intensive projects.

Working in joint venture partnerships

We extend our high standards of governance to our joint 

ventures via our Joint Venture Governance Standard 

which outlines our requirements to be met. These include 

due diligence, consultation and approval requirements, 

policies and procedures and the ongoing requirements for 

governance during the operating phase of the joint venture.

ASSURANCE AND TAX CONTRIBUTIONS

Assurance

We use independent assurance 

to support our commitment to 

transparency and accountability.

Independent third-party auditors give us limited assurance 

on our ESG performance data. They do this in line with 

the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 

ISAE 3000’.

This year Ernst &amp; Young completed third-party limited 

assurance of our key social metrics:

Tax contributions

We make a positive impact in the communities 

and environments in which we operate, and we 

have a strong commitment to transparency and 

compliance. 

We voluntarily participate in the Board of Taxation’s Tax Transparency Code in 

Australia, and our report for FY202019 can be found here.

We have a global tax profile, and our tax contributions and activities benefit 

the many countries in which we operate. We have made a significant direct 

contribution to those economies with approximately $1.1 billion paid in 

effective tax contributions in FY2020 across our key operating jurisdictions. 

We continue to contribute significantly through the collection of 

employment-related and indirect taxes in the 49 jurisdictions in which we 

have a presence.

In our FY2020 Sustainability Report we reported our FY2020 emissions baseline as 136,026 tCO2e and 

488,384MWh. Following further validation we have revised our FY2020 baseline to 114,240 tCO2e 

and 371,880MWh.

Also, in our FY2020 Sustainability report, we reported our emissions intensity per person as  

2.99 tCO2e/person. We subtracted our field-based workforce in North America from the denominator of 

this metric, as these people work on customer sites. This year, we have simplified this metric by using our 

total people number. We have revised our FY2020 emissions intensity per person to 2.20 tCO2e/person.

Significant indirect economic impacts

We support projects in the energy, chemicals and resources sectors internationally. This includes 

projects that enable communities to develop economically via productive use of natural resources, skills 

development and lifting communities out of energy poverty. 

Worley also makes a wider economic contribution across a range of countries through various activities 

such as the Worley Foundation and other corporate social responsibility programs, such as those in India 

and South Africa, and local content procurement programs.

Our people spend their wages locally on diverse goods and services, providing a further indirect economic 

contribution. We do not measure this indirect economic benefit globally, however, it is an important 

component of our contribution in the 49 countries in which we operate. 

We contribute our global technical and project delivery expertise as well as our experience of different 

industry standards and regulatory approaches to relevant governments and industry groups 

internationally. This input is provided for consideration in the development of industry standards and 

government policy. 

For example, as a partner with Princeton’s Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment, we are 

combining our real-world project expertise with Princeton’s academic analysis to develop thought 

leadership on how to deliver net zero infrastructure.

GRI 302 – Energy

302-1

Energy consumption within the organization

Caring for our planet

CDP report

Worley uses the operational control* approach to account for our GHG emissions. 

Our GHG emissions sources primarily come from consumption of fuels, (including petrol, diesel, natural 

gas, propane and diesel) and electricity usage in our offices. 

We collected our activity data from energy bills, fuel invoices and third parties such as our fleet providers. 

Activity data was available for about 90% of our locations. When activity data was not found we 

estimated based on floor space or from previous years’ data.

In most cases, consumption data for fuels such as diesel and petrol was in liters. This was converted to 

kilowatt-hours and tonnes of CO2e using emissions factors sourced from the GHG Protocol. For electricity 

usage, we applied location-specific emissions factors to calculate our GHG emissions. These factors came 

from the IEA and government sources such as the EIA (US Energy Information Administration).

CDP report

For paper usage, we collected volume and emissions data from our major global paper supplier, who 

supplies approximately 1/3 of our offices with paper. Then, this number was multiplied by 3 to estimate 

the amount of paper used globally. 

For data centers, we collected energy and emissions data straight from our data centre suppliers. 2 of 

our suppliers did not provide energy or emissions data. In these cases, we estimated the energy used 

based on energy used by other data centers, then converted to tonnes of CO2 using location-based 

emissions factors. 

For business travel, we collected data straight from our business travel suppliers. This data included all 

flights and car trips booked by our travel suppliers over the reporting period, the kilometers traveled, and 

the equivalent tonnes of CO2e. In some cases, the travel agent only provided data for kilometers traveled. 

In these cases, the emissions were calculated using the UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for 

Company Reporting.

All GHG are included as we calculate our emissions using CO2 equivalents.

Management of significant 

waste-related impacts

Our offices and fabrication yards generate waste. This year, we have measured and disclosed the waste 

from our fabrication yards. These are some of our most material sources of waste generation due to the 

nature of work that we do there.

Our fabrication yards each have different processes to separate their waste as they operate in different 

jurisdictions. We collected data in the form of waste tracking spreadsheets and invoices from waste 

contractors. We then categorized these waste streams into waste directed to disposal and waste 

diverted from disposal (i.e. recycling). Our recycling streams include mixed recycling, scrap metal, organic 

waste, electronic waste, paper, cardboard and wood. General waste is sent to landfill or waste-to-energy 

depending on the jurisdiction.

In some of our fabrication yards, our waste was measured in approximate volumes. In these cases, 

we used norms from other fabrication yards to convert volume to weight in tonnes. Next year, we will 

work to improve our data capture, improve our recycling rates, and begin to disclose waste generated in 

our offices.

Hazard identification, risk assessment, 

and incident investigation

Worley applies effective risk management 

principles and processes which apply to office 

and field activities to enhance decision-making, 

leverage opportunities and assist in reducing 

threats. The business HSE and Assurance 

personnel are equipped with the appropriate 

skills and competencies to support office 

and field workers. 

The risk management process is applied 

to identify, prioritize, appropriately 

prevent, minimize, mitigate, communicate 

and manage risks throughout all existing 

and planned activities. 

The implementation of risk management 

processes to existing and planned activities 

follows a consistent methodology of application:

• assessment and evaluation of HSE risk

• identification of HSE controls

• implementation of HSE controls to as low as 

reasonably practicable (ALARP) 

• communication of controls

• monitoring of controls.

Risk management tools and procedures include:

• project/office level risk assessment and 

action plans

• permit to work and authorizations

• Job Hazard Analysis (JHA)

• danger hazard identification

• workplace inspections

• hazard reporting.

Observed hazards during day-to-day activities 

are firstly addressed by the observer on a ‘see 

and fix’ basis, provided that they are capable 

and competent to do so. If the hazard cannot be 

rectified by the observer, they are required to 

report it to their supervisor. 

Activities do not recommence until the hazard 

is under control and approval is provided by 

site management. All personnel with field 

execution tasks conduct a personal hazard 

identification process. 

This process aids in the identification of any 

last-minute hazards not identified previously from 

the JHA process. All personnel are empowered to 

stop work if they feel it unsafe to continue. The 

activity is re-assessed and only when safe to do 

will the activity recommence. The requirements of 

personal hazard identification are detailed in the 

Danger Identification and Control Standard. 

Processes are in place for the timely reporting, 

classifying, investigation, recording and closing out 

of incidents and near misses. All health and safety 

related incidents and near misses are reported in a 

timely manner into the Worley Assurance system. 

A communication protocol is in place to ensure the 

reporting is targeted to the level of management 

(and where required regulatory authorities) with 

a timeframe based on the severity of the incident. 

Immediately following any event, appropriate 

emergency response plans are activated, and the 

care of any injured persons and the safety of all 

persons is the priority. Investigations are conducted 

by personnel trained in investigation techniques to 

identify and document contributing factors, root 

causes and systemic failures that contributed to 

the incident. Corrective actions arising out of event 

investigations shall be evaluated, tabled and then 

implemented in accordance with the hierarchy 

of hazard controls. 

Lessons learned from incidents, near misses and 

investigations are shared internally and with relevant 

third parties, with consideration as applicable for 

sharing with other locations. The outcomes from 

the incidents and near misses investigation are 

assessed to seek trends and analyzed to determine 

improvement opportunities, including the updating 

of standards, procedures and guidelines as relevant. 

Company alerts are drafted in accordance with the 

communications and consultation standards and 

shared depending on the significance of the learning 

and the breadth of its relevance. As applicable to 

the business requirements, Incident Review Boards 

made up of senior representatives review events 

within a framework with the focus on determining 

consolidated learnings for the business.

Occupational health services

The Worley risk management processes apply to the identification, assessment and risk control of 

occupational health exposures and illnesses. The application of the risk process covers existing and future 

planned activities targeting the physical, ergonomic, chemical, radiological, biological, ergonomic and 

psychological hazards in the workplace.

For all applicable projects, a health risk assessment is performed during the planning phases and prior to 

site mobilization and concurrent with preparation of the overarching Project HSE Management Plan.

An Industrial Hygiene Surveillance Plan is included in the Health Risk Assessment. The hygiene 

surveillance plan provides a breakdown of exposure groups identified for the defined scope of work and a 

summary of required and recommended worker monitoring to be performed.

An evaluation of the offsite medical facilities and services is undertaken using pre-agreed list of criteria 

specific to the risks and medical needs identified through the Health Risk Assessment process. The 

evaluation provides a formal recommendation to the project/office manager and is undertaken by a 

suitably qualified person.

Following selection of the medical provider, consideration is given to the establishment of a service 

agreement for the scope of services required. Onsite medical facilities, equipment, resources and 

medication required is identified through the risk assessment process and agreed following the 

evaluation of offsite medical provider capabilities first.

Included

403-4

Worker participation, consultation, and 

communication on occupational health 

and safety

Worley project and office management are responsible for ensuring suitable and sufficient consultation 

and communication with personnel with regard to matters of health, safety and environmental 

protection. Consideration is given by management to the establishment of structured HSE Committees 

for offices and field sites. 

Many of the Worley locations’ health and safety legislation set guidelines for communication and 

consultation with personnel through the establishment of health and safety committees and 

representatives. Worley’s local management fully complies with the structure and frequency of 

these requirements. The HSE Committee is made up of an equal representation of elected workforce 

representatives and management representatives nominated for the position. The HSE Committee takes 

into consideration and assists the management with recommendations on a wide range of programs, 

measures and procedures. 

Worley applies a range of methods and processes for communicating local and/or company-wide health 

and safety information, including the employee portal, newsletters, incident reports, signs, notice 

boards, manuals, meetings, reports, email etc, as is appropriate to the specific workplace and workforce. 

In field locations, tool-box meetings and job/pre-start meetings are tools used to ensure effective 

two-way communication.

Worker training on occupational health 

and safety

All new company personnel (including temporary and permanent transfers), contractors and visitors to 

any company-managed site undergo a work location specific induction, introduced by a member of the 

work location senior management team. The site-specific content of the induction is identified during 

the development of the project and prior to commencement at site, and documented in a checklist format. 

The site induction includes hazards pertaining to the scope of work not identified during the generic 

Worley induction.

The Worley requirements in meeting the required skills and competencies for the activities being 

undertaken are based on location/project specific systems. The system is premised on maintaining the 

continual identification of HSE training/qualifications and competencies required for each position and 

to ensure these competencies are met and maintained by all personnel for their respective positions.

To ensure consistent high standards and compliance with local legal and other requirements, training 

and development solutions for critical HSE competencies where possible are provided by recognized/

accredited independent providers wherever such provision is available.

Promotion of worker health

Our people’s needs vary across the countries and environments in which we operate, and as such, health 

promotion and programs are generally locally driven to account for the local context. Our local health 

and safety committees are proactive in evaluating and leading many of the health programs, which may 

include free or subsidized medical checks, flu shots and other local inoculations, gym memberships/

classes and health campaigns. Our people have access to confidential EAP services and ethics 

helpline reporting.

Prevention and mitigation of occupational 

health and safety impacts directly linked by 

business relationships

Worley applies effective risk management principles and processes to enhance decision-making, 

leverage opportunities and assist in reducing threats for all existing and planned activities including those 

of significant negative impact to health and safety. The scope of risk management application applies 

to office and all field activities.

Worley has implemented ‘Life-Saving Rules’ that have been developed to draw attention to the activities 

most likely to lead to a fatality and the lifesaving actions over which an individual has control. The rules 

are intended to support existing company management systems and risk control processes.

The Worley Life-Saving Rules comprise of:

• Bypassing Safety Controls

• Confined Space

• Driving

• Energy Isolation

• Hot Work

• Line of Fire

• Safe Mechanical Lifting

• Work Authorization 

• Working at Height.

Activities that are aligned with Life-Saving Rules are detailed within: 

• Project HSE Plan

• Project Risk Assessment 

• Project Assurance Plan.

Our Job Hazard Analysis Standard highlights the importance of conducting risk assessments before 

beginning the job. This ensures that any hazards can be addressed. We use Company Alerts to 

communicate learnings across our Company. These are designed to reduce risk severity by increasing 

recognition and awareness of risks. Alerts describe incidents, contributing and potential causal factors, 

and corrective actions for risk mitigation. 

This disclosure only includes workers for sites in which we have operational control. The above rates have 

been calculated based on 200,000 hours worked. Our reporting is in line with OSHA standard CFR 1904.
