Portfolio Overview



Our	flagship	project,	BSD	City,	is	the	largest	privately	

developed	township	and	the	most	ambitious	urban	

planning	development	in	Indonesia	with	a	development	

area	(including	land	rights)	of	approximately	5,950	

hectares.	BSD	City’s	Master	Plan	is	for	the	city	to	

comprise	approximately	80	residential	estates,	which	will	

cover	approximately	two-thirds	of	BSD	City’s	effective	

area,	with	seven	commercial	sub-town	centres	and	three	

dedicated central business districts. 

The	development	of	BSD	City’s	residential,	business	and	

commercial	properties,	as	well	as	supporting	amenities	

and infrastructure is being carried out in three phases.  

Phase	1	was	completed	in	2008.	We	are	currently	in	

Phase	2	which	is	expected	to	be	completed	in	2020.	

Phase	3	is	targeted	to	commence	in	2020,	with	expected	

completion	by	2035.	As	at	31	December	2019,	BSD	

City	has	more	than	20,000	residential	properties,	five	

commercial	sub-town	centres	which	include	commercial	

and	industrial	facilities,	schools,	hospitals,	parks	and	

utilities,	with	a	total	population	size	exceeding	160,000.		

In	addition	to	property	development,	our	subsidiary	

company,	BSDE,	also	provides	facility	services,	such	

as	water	treatment	and	estate	management	services,	

and operates several investment properties in BSD 

City,	including	ITC	BSD,	Ocean	Park	Water	Theme	Park	

and	Green	Office	Park,	which	is	a	low-density	office	

park	including	ten	low-density	office	buildings	and	a	

shopping mall sitting on a land area of 25 hectares. BSD 

City	is	well-connected	to	the	central	business	districts	

in	Central	Jakarta	through	two	toll	roads,	Kebon	Jeruk	

and	Pondok	Indah.	To	further	enhance	its	accessibility,	

BSDE	commenced	construction	of	the	Serpong-Balaraja	

toll	road	connecting	to	BSD	City	in	July	2019.	Upon	

completion,	this	will	provide	direct	toll	road	access	to	the	

Jakarta-Merak	toll	road,	the	main	highway	linking	Jakarta	

to	western	Java,	as	well	as	linking	BSD	City	directly	to	the	

Soekarno-Hatta	International	Airport.	In	addition,	there	are	

three	train	stations	within	BSD	City	that	offer	commuters’	

direct	access	to	Central	Jakarta	through	a	double-track	

railway	service.

Outside	of	BSD	City,	BSDE	has	property	development	

projects	and	landbank	situated	in	Central	Jakarta,	West	

Jakarta,	North	Jakarta,	South	Jakarta,	Bekasi,	Cibubur,	

Surabaya,	Medan,	Balikpapan,	Makassar,	Samarinda,	

Manado,	Palembang,	Semarang,	Depok	and	Cikarang.	

Apart	from	property	development,	the	Group	owns	and	

operates	investment	properties	comprising	of	office	

buildings,	retail	space	and	hospitality-related	assets

Sinarmas Land Limited

Sustainability Report 2019

Chairman and CEO Statement

Dear Valued Stakeholders,

2019	saw	the	strengthening	of	sustainability	policies	and	

implementation	within	Sinarmas	Land	Limited	(“SML”	

or “the Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively 

“the	Group”).	This	report	showcases	our	continuous	

commitment to integrating sustainability into the 

Company’s	core	business,	in	order	to	create	value	for	all	

stakeholders.	

As	we	close	the	decade	in	2019,	businesses,	

governments,	and	society	at	large	are	realising	that	in	

order	to	create	a	sustainable	future,	there	needs	to	be	

greater	involvement	and	action	from	all	stakeholders.	

With this comes increased prominence of sustainability 

disclosure and reporting by corporations around the 

world.	

While	SML	has	been	relatively	new	to	sustainability	

reporting,	we	are	committed	to	playing	our	part	in	

championing	ESG	issues	and	serving	as	an	example	

for other organisations in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. 

To	date,	SML	has	produced	three	annual	sustainability	

reports,	which	have	displayed	consistent	improvement	in	

reporting	standards	and	alignment	with	international	and	

national guidelines such as the Global Reporting Initiative 

(GRI)	Standards	and	2016	SGX	Sustainability	Reporting	

Guide.

In	this	report,	you	will	be	able	to	see	SML’s	growing	

commitment to continually strengthen our sustainability 

efforts. What started out as an initial focus for 

sustainability	within	our	flagship	BSD	City	project	is	now	

transforming into a comprehensive sustainability strategy 

and	reporting	across	our	operations.	In	2019,	we	have	

significantly	expanded	the	scope	of	our	report,	to	be	in	

tandem	with	our	increasing	influence	and	potential	to	

create an impact in Indonesia and beyond. 

As	a	step	up	from	previous	years,	we	have	included	

buildings	and	projects	within	BSD	City,	and	in	

Jabodetabek.	The	scope	expansion	in	2019	led	to	the	

increase	of	Gross	Floor	Area	(GFA)	and	GFA	Occupied,	

by	261%	and	346%	to	2.5	million	m2 and 1.86 million 

m2	respectively.	In	striving	for	more	complete	reporting,	

we	will	continue	to	expand	our	scope	in	the	future.	To	

facilitate	this,	we	have	set	out	a	clear	roadmap	outlining	

SML’s	sustainability	progress	in	reporting	scope	

expansion,	as	well	as	future	scope	expansion	targets.	

This	roadmap	is	set	to	lead	us	to	cover	all	our	Indonesia

sustainability	consultant,	we	were	able	to	assess	and	

categorise	material	issues	into	areas	of	focus,	and	

subsequently	prioritising	them.	This	resulted	in	the	

integration of the revised areas of focus into four pillars 

under	SML’s	Sustainability	Vision,	of	which	will	form	the	

central	framework	of	SML’s	sustainability	approach	and	

reporting	moving	forward.	

The	four	pillars	of	SML’s	Sustainability	Vision	are,	

Best	in	Class	Real	Estate,	Climate	Action,	Sustainable	

Community,	and	Educational	Patronage	–	all	of	which	are	

mapped to the relevant Sustainable Development Goals 

(SDGs).	In	this	report,	you	will	learn	about	the	progress	

we	have	made	and	the	targets	set	under	each	pillar.	

In	striving	to	be	the	best	in	class	within	the	real	estate	

industry,	we	focus	on	creating	quality	development	

projects	to	our	customers,	as	well	as	implementing	

human resource policies that are above industry norms. 

Beyond	just	creating	high-quality	projects	with	excellent	

facilities	and	services,	SML	stands	out	in	our	ever-

growing	commitment	to	embed	sustainable	development	

into	our	core	business	strategy,	specifically	through	

incorporating “Green” building design and technological 

innovation in our products. 

These	efforts	have	been	recognised	in	Indonesia	and	

internationally.	In	2019,	SML	continued	to	add	the	

following	awards	to	its	existing	portfolio:

• 

FIABCI World Prix d’Excellence Awards 

2019 – World Silver Winner – Sustainable

Sinarmas Land Limited

Sustainability Report 2019

to	Indonesia’s	Paris	Agreement	Contributions.	In	applying	

international	green	building	standards,	SML	is	able	to	

create	positive	impacts	in	the	environments	we	operate	

in.	An	example	of	this	is	The	Breeze	BSD	City,	a	lifestyle	

retail	mall	dubbed	as	“the	mall	with	no	walls”.	Through	

harnessing	passive	design	strategies,	the	mall	reduces	

energy	consumption	from	air-conditioning	and	lighting.

While	BSD	City	remains	our	flagship	development,	we	

are	expanding	the	scope	of	environmental	performance	

disclosures,	as	mentioned	above.	We	have	also	

established clear monitoring and reporting systems for 

materials,	energy,	and	water	used	within	our	construction	

and	operation	of	our	developments.	This	not	only	

promotes	transparency	but	also	allows	us	to	utilise	

such data to better manage and optimise our building 

operations.	It	is	for	these	reasons	of	scope	expansion	

that	you	will	notice	an	increase	in	materials,	energy,	and	

water	usage	for	2019,	as	disclosed	in	the	report.	

Our	efforts	also	extend	beyond	SML’s	projects	and	

properties. As a founding corporate member at Green 

Building	Council	Indonesia,	we	share	these	best-

practices	on	sustainability	with	the	industry.	

We	recognise	that	the	wellbeing	and	progress	of	local	

communities	in	the	areas	we	operate	in	are	key	to	SML’s	

sustained prosperity and success. Aside from providing 

larger	infrastructural	development	and	support,	the	

Company often participates in community engagement 

and development initiatives across our operating areas. 

In	2019,	we	continued	to	engage	our	stakeholders	within	

these	communities	actively,	through	regular	surveys,	

campaigns,	communications,	and	community	events.	

These	channels	allow	for	members	of	the	communities	to	

raise	concerns,	feedback	and	suggestions.	

SML	considers	education	to	be	one	of	the	key	

foundations	of	sustainable	development.	Internally,	we	

conduct annual employee training and performance 

reviews	to	support	career	growth	and	up-skilling	of	

employees.	We	believe	that	such	efforts	will	create	a	

ripple	effect	on	the	wider	society,	and	is	also	beneficial	

to	the	future	growth	of	our	Group.	Externally,	we	continue	

to	make	a	significant	impact	within	the	wider	community	

to enable equal opportunity and access to education 

through scholarships and capacity building programs. 

One	of	such	initiatives	in	2019	was	the	Gerakan Sekolah 

Menyenangkan	(GSM),	a	social	movement	aimed	at	

helping	educators	in	the	Tangerang	District	and	South	

Tangerang	City	to	improve	their	soft	skills,	thereby	

enabling them to nurture successful future leaders. 

Certainly,	such	achievements	and	success	will	not	

be	possible	without	our	employees	and	workers.	SML	

places great emphasis on occupational health &amp; safety 

for	its	employees	and	takes	the	workplace	accidents	

very	seriously.	Resulting	from	our	continuous	initiatives,	

we	are	pleased	to	report	that	there	were	no	fatalities	or	

any	work-related	injuries	in	all	our	buildings	under	the	

Asset	Management,	Commercial,	and	Retail	&amp;	Hospitality	

Group Divisions. 

Lastly,	we	would	like	to	acknowledge	our	stakeholders	

once	again,	for	providing	valuable	insight	into	our	

materiality	assessment,	enabling	us	to	continually	

improve	on	our	disclosures	and	better	realise	SML’s	

Sustainability	Vision.	Moving	forward,	we	hope	to	sustain	

and	improve	on	the	level	of	stakeholder	engagement	and	

involvement	that	we	saw	in	2019.	

2020	marks	the	start	of	a	new	decade,	one	that	will	see	

a greater emphasis on sustainable development. We 

hope that the strategic alignment and centralised focus 

of	our	Sustainability	Vision	will	be	able	to	create	greater	

economic,	environmental	and	social	value	for	Indonesia	

and	beyond.	We	are	excited	to	work	together	with	you	to	

realise this vision.

About The Report

This	report	covers	the	period	from	January	1	to	

December	31,	2019	(FY2019).	Going	forward,	we	will	

continue to publish this report on an annual basis. Using 

established and recognised sustainability leaders among 

our	peers	as	a	yardstick,	we	continue	to	apply	the	GRI	

reporting	framework	to	ensure	accuracy,	reliability,	

clarity,	and	comparability	of	the	information	presented	in	

this report.

During	2019,	we	reviewed	our	material	issues	and	made	

subsequent updates to our material issues to better 

reflect	changes	in	the	environment,	our	business	and	

our	stakeholder’s	priorities.	When	reviewing	materiality,	

we	adopted	a	comprehensive,	structured	and	holistic	

approach	to	include	the	society,	environment	and	

communities	in	which	we	operate.	We	engaged	a	wide	

range	of	stakeholders	during	our	materiality	review,	to	

ensure	that	we	took	into	consideration	both	internal	and	

external	viewpoints	on	the	sustainability	issues	that	are	

most	pertinent	to	our	long-term	value	creation.	See	page	

24	for	full	details	of	the	review.		

Our sustainability report demonstrates our ever-growing commitment to 

a greener, healthier, safer and more prosperous Indonesia. This year, we 

have significantly expanded the scope of our reporting, both in terms 

of data disclosure and the breadth of operations, as we continue to 

integrate sustainability values and principles deeper into the fabric of 

our organisation. 

Scope Expansion

Since	publishing	our	first	report	in	2018,	the	Group	

has	expanded	the	report’s	coverage	significantly	from	

the initial focus on BSD City to developments outside 

the	flagship	development.	We	aim	to	cover	all	of	our	

operations’	developments	and	properties	in	Indonesia	

and	internationally	by	2021	and	2022	respectively.	Below	

is	a	roadmap	of	SML’s	sustainability	progress	in	terms	of	

our	reporting	scope	expansion,	as	well	as	future	scope	

expansion	targets.

In	this	year’s	report,	we	have	expanded	the	scope	

significantly	to	include	additional	buildings	and	projects	

within	BSD	City	and	Jabodetabek.	The	table	below	

provide a detailed list of data collected in this report on a 

per project/ property basis.

As our commercial and residential properties are 

managed	by	external	parties,	some	of	these	properties	

are	unable	to	provide	waste,	health	and	safety	data	for	

this	year’s	report.				

We group buildings under our property management into 

3	broad	categories,	namely	Green	buildings,	high-rise	

office	buildings,	and	the	rest	of	the	buildings.	As	the	

nature	of	each	building	differs,	we	have	set	out	specific	

targets for each respective category.

our	financial	performance,	as	well	as	additional	detail

Board Statement

The	Board	of	Sinarmas	Land	has	the	ultimate	

responsibility for the preparation of this Sustainability 

Report. Our sustainable development strategy and 

activities highlighted in this report are guided by 

internationally	recognised	frameworks	(GRI	reporting	

standards) and institutions such as the United 

Nations	Global	Compact	(UNGC)	and	the	Brundtland	

Commission. We are proud to be an early adopter of the 

UN	Sustainable	Development	Goals,	and	the	first	major	

Indonesian real estate developer to become a signatory 

of	the	UNGC	through	the	Indonesia	Global	Compact	

Network	(IGCN).	

This	report	has	been	prepared	following	the	GRI	

Standards: Core Option. It also meets the requirements 

of	the	2016	SGX	Sustainability	Reporting	Guide	in	all	

material aspects. 

As	part	of	our	continual	improvement	towards	

sustainability,	we	have	actively	engaged	our	stakeholders	

in	2019	through	various	initiatives	such	as	independent	

consultant-led	focused	group	discussion,	and	customers	

tenant’s	satisfaction	survey	conducted	by	an	external	

vendor.	Details	of	our	stakeholder	engagements	can	be	

found	under	the	sections	of	“Stakeholder	Engagement	

on our Materiality Assessment” in page 24 and 

“Engagement	Program	for	All	Stakeholders”	on	page	64.	

These	engagements	have	allowed	the	Board	to	focus	

our attention and efforts on issues most relevant to our 

stakeholders.	

The	Board	is	constantly	working	with	the	Audit	and	Risk	

Management Committee (“ARC”) to provide oversight on 

significant	environmental,	social	and	governance	issues	

that	might	potentially	have	an	impact	on	SML’s	long-term	

business	objectives.	The	ARC,	in	turn,	reviews	SML’s	

sustainability	programs	and	ensures	the	Board	is	kept	

up-to-date	on	all	relevant	developments.

The	Board	has	reviewed	SML’s	material	issues	

determination	processes	and	acknowledged	that	the	

list	provides	a	fair	representation	of	SML’s	material	ESG	

issues.	Together	with	the	Management,	the	Board	will	

continually	monitor	and	review	these	material	issues,	as	

part of our commitment and responsibility to the company 

and	our	stakeholders.

Our Approach

The four pillars of our Sustainability Vision are entrenched in 

our identity as an economically, environmentally, and socially 

responsible organisation. As one of Indonesia’s leading real estate 

developers, our pillars enable us to create transformative strategies 

and actions that bring value to our stakeholders, communities, 

nation and the preservation of Mother Nature.

In this section 

The	following	pages	introduce	Sinarmas	Land’s	

sustainability	vision	and	strategy,	including	our	approach	

to	materiality	and	stakeholder	engagement.	

Best in Class Real Estate

Our	top	priority	and	greatest	strength:	By	providing	state-

of-the-art	facilities	and	services	of	the	highest	quality,	we

current	and	future	generations,	as	well	as	to	Indonesia	as	

a	whole.	We	are	committed	to

Sinarmas Land’s Sustainability Vision

All	of	SML’s	projects,	spearheaded	by	our	flagship	

BSD	City	project,	are	perfect	embodiments	of	our	

Sustainability	Vision,	which	is	based	on	the	four	

foundation	pillars	outlined	below.	Each	of	the	foundation	

pillars	shapes	SML’s	sustainability	principle	and	core	

business	strategies.	Through	them,	the	Group	sets	

sustainability targets driven by various initiatives and 

measurement metrics.

Governance &amp; Risk Management

The	implementation	of	SML’s	sustainability	development	

strategy	is	developed	around	SML’s	strong	corporate	

culture and our core values:

• Positive Attitude

• Integrity

• Commitment

• Continuous Improvement

• Innovation

• Loyalty

We	have	always	taken	a	long-term	view	in	creating	

value	for	our	stakeholders.	Hence,	we	will	continue	to	

integrate	our	economic,	environmental	and	social	goals	

across our business units through the implementation of 

sustainability-oriented	practices.

Our sustainability initiatives are integrated into the 

Group’s	overall	governance	and	operations,	with	

direct	guidance	and	involvement	from	the	Company’s	

management team. Our sustainability structure 

comprises	of	senior	management,	middle	management	

and	employees	from	various	functions.	Our	Executive	

Risk	Management	Committee	(“ERMC”)	comprises	of	

15 senior leaders from different strategic business units 

(“SBU”)	and	support	functions.	We	have	identified	roles	

and	responsibilities,	with	three	Person-in-Charge	(“PIC”)	

each being responsible for overseeing the respective 

environmental	and	social,	employment	and	economic	

dimensions	of	the	Company.	They	are	supported	by	

process	owners	for	the	respective	sustainability	topics	

and programs.

is	constantly	kept	abreast	of	our	material	sustainability

risk	management	practices	by	incorporating	the	risk	of	

not	achieving	our	sustainability	goals	into	our	ERM.		

Materiality and Stakeholder Engagement

In	2019,	we	undertook	a	review	of	our	material	

sustainability issues and updated the materiality 

assessment	matrix.	The	review	of	our	materiality	

issues	was	based	on	GRI’s	Principles	for	Defining	

Report	Content	and	follows	GRI’s	four-step	approach	

of	identification,	prioritisation,	validation	and	review	of	

material issues. 

As	a	key	part	of	our	materiality	review,	we	engaged	a	

wide	group	of	stakeholders	through	various	approaches	

such	as	Focus	Group	Discussion	(FGD),	customer	and	

tenant	satisfaction	surveys,	and	employee	engagement	

survey	to	better	understand	their	concerns,	feedback	and	

area of improvement.

Sinarmas Land Limited

Sustainability Report 2019

Our Approach

Stakeholder Engagement on our Materiality 

Assessment

To	ensure	our	material	topics	address	future	risks	and	

opportunities,	we	undertook	a	comprehensive	materiality	

review	in	2019.	Our	economic,	environmental	and	social	

PICs	conducted	an	internal	assessment,	ranking	the	

degree	of	significance	each	topic	potentially	has	on	the	

business,	and	its	relative	relevance	to	SML’s	operations	

and	sustainability	pillars.	The	assessment	results	were	

reviewed	internally	by	the	ERMC.

Alongside	the	internal	review,	SML	engaged	a	wide	

range	of	internal	and	external	stakeholders,	to	take	

into consideration their opinions on the topics that 

are	key	to	future	proofing	SML’s	long	term	value.	We	

adopted various engagement methods to enable us to 

successfully	take	into	account	multiple	viewpoints:

• FGDs	were	conducted	for	selected	stakeholders;

• Customer	and	Tenant	Satisfaction	Survey	was	

performed	through	interviews	with	our	residential	&amp;	

commercial	customers,	office	building	&amp;	mall	tenants,	

and hotel guests;

• Employee	Engagement	Survey	was	performed	by	

SML Human Capital using an online questionnaire.

1. Focus Group Discussion (FGD)

On	the	5	and	6	November	2019,	we	conducted	an	

FGD	session	with	50	individual	stakeholders	from	

eight	different	stakeholder	groups.	These	individuals	

represent	stakeholders	from	academia,	civil	society,	

tenants,	residential	customers,	media,	business	partners,	

regulators,	and	local	communities	from	both	BSD	

Knowledge	House	and	BSD	Modern	Market.

Conducted	by	an	independent	external	consultant,	the	

discussion	focused	on	issues	relating	to	Sinarmas	Land’s	

business	processes,	conflict	of	interest	and	suggestion	

for	future	stakeholder	engagement	initiatives.

Outcomes from the FGD have been incorporated into 

SML’s	materiality	assessment	and	material	topics	in	this	

year’s	report.

2. Customer and Tenant Satisfaction Survey

In	2019,	we	conducted	a	customer	and	tenant	

satisfaction	survey	over	a	period	of	10	weeks	to	track	the	

following:

i.	 Customer	Satisfaction	Index	(CSI)	and	Customer	

Loyalty	Index	(CLI)

ii.	 Perception	towards	SML

iii. Sources of satisfaction and dissatisfaction. 

iv. Performance and overall satisfaction of our customer 

journey

v.	 Performance	at	each	touchpoint	which	has	a	direct	

interaction	with	customers

vi.	 Feedback	from	customers	for	future	improvements

We	conducted	satisfaction	surveys	with	office	building	

tenants,	mall	tenants,	and	residential/customers.	A	total	

of	201	office	building	tenants	and	269	mall	tenants	

participated in the survey. Occupational health and safety 

remain the most important aspect of sustainability for 

both	groups	of	tenants.	This	result	aligns	with	SML’s	area	

of focus on “Attention to Customer and Occupational 

Health”.	Separately,	both	office	building	and	mall	tenants	

now	place	a	higher	importance	on	green	environment	in	

2019,	compared	to	2018.

Best in Class Real Estate

In this section

The	following	section	provides	an	overview	of	Sinarmas	

Land’s	efforts	to	provide	best	in	class	real	estate	and	

products	to	our	customers.	We	have	identified	four	areas	

of focus that is vital to our continuous successes:

•	 Providing	excellent	facilities	and	services

• Setting programs to achieve sustainable development

• Attention to customers and occupational health &amp; 

safety

• Compliance to all related regulatory requirements

SML is increasing our focus on sustainable development 

by embedding “Green” concepts into our development 

projects.	We	work	hard	to	address	climate	and	

environmental	issues,	as	well	as	minimising	the	

environmental impacts of our projects and products. 

As one of the founding corporate members of the 

Green	Building	Council	Indonesia,	we	aim	to	remain	an	

exemplary	and	influential	leader	in	driving	sustainable	

development in Indonesia.

SML also places importance on technological innovation 

in our development projects. We aim to integrate digital 

initiatives into our projects to improve management 

efficiencies	post	development.	At	present,	we	are	

gradually	integrating	the	management	of	BSD	City	with	

various digital initiatives to create a Smart City that 

provides high living standards to residents.  

 

Our	targets	and	aspirations	to	provide	excellent	facilities	

and	services,	to	prioritise	customer	and	occupational	

health	and	safety,	and	to	realise	sustainable	development	

are built upon a strong governance structure that is 

ethical,	transparent,	and	compliant	to	all	rules	and	

regulations. We have implemented internal systems 

to monitor and investigate any potential incidents of 

corruption	or	non-compliance	in	every	aspect	of	our	

business.	We	seek	to	remain	a	trustworthy	brand	and	an	

industry	leader	with	high	ethics	and	integrity.

Providing Excellent Facilities &amp; Services

At the centre of our efforts is our commitment to provide 

the	best	for	our	customers.	SML	aims	to	develop	first-

class	products	with	excellent	facilities	and	services	to	

We strive to be the best in class for real estate. As one of 

the largest property developers in Indonesia, we take this 

responsibility seriously and seek to continuously develop and 

improve our sustainability performance.  

meet	(and	exceed)	the	need	of	our	customers.	We	set	

targets and implement initiatives to maintain product 

quality from development to management phases. When 

developing	property,	we	always	perform	the	following	to	

ensure the quality of our products:

•	 conduct	market	research	to	capture	customers’	

needs	and	wants;

• perform selection and tender to obtain the best 

material vendor and contractor;

• perform quality assurance in certain steps of the 

product development process; and

•	 provide	after-sales	services	after	the	product	has	

been sold and handed over to customers.

After	the	completion	of	development	projects,	SML	

actively provides the best services to customers and 

tenants	as	the	property	and	township	manager.	We	

ensure the facilities provided to our customers and 

tenants	are	sufficient,	efficient	and	in	good	conditions.	

Our services include:

• conduct regular maintenance for building equipment;

• ensure health and safety for building occupants;

• conduct regular maintenance in the residential and 

township	environment;

•	 ensure	the	environment	security	of	every	property,	

residential	and	township	managed	by	SML;	and	

• ensure the availability of public facilities based on 

residential	needs,	such	as	places	of	schools,	worship,	

malls,	hospital,	etc.

SML recognises that our human capital is an important 

asset in providing the best products and services. By 

focusing	on	our	employees’	well-being	and	personal	

growth,	we	strive	to	be	an	Indonesian	employer	of	

choice.	We	seek	to	hire	the	best	and	provide	them	with	

ample opportunities to nurture their talents and enhance 

their	skills.	We	have	put	in	place	various	initiatives	and	

policies	to	ensure	that	our	workforce	and	talents	develop	

fairly and effectively to be adept at providing the best 

services	to	customers.	Our	workforce	turnover	figures	are	

a testament to our commitment to our valued employees.

Our	commitment	to	employees’	well-being	is	

demonstrated through our human resource (“HR”) 

policies and initiatives driven by our Human Capital team. 

The	team	explores	and	drives	initiatives	which	are	geared

towards	building	a	conducive	and	inclusive	workplace	for	

our	employees’	development,	well-being	and	satisfaction.	

Some of the initiatives are:

• equal opportunities provided for all genders on every 

level

In	view	of	the	importance	that	human	capital	has	on	

our	product	and	service	excellence,	we	will	be	looking	

at	our	overall	employment	statistics	for	the	Group’s	

Indonesian	operations	(excluding	any	joint	ventures),	

our	performance	as	an	equal	opportunity	employer,	and	

benefits	and	welfare	programs,	in	this	section.

Outstanding Facilities and Services

all complaints from customers and channel them 

internally to the respective departments for resolution. 

Through	this	initiative,	we	will	be	able	to	keep	track	

of	the	complaints	and	resolutions,	ensuring	that	no	

complaints	will	be	left	unattended.

New Hires and Employee Retention

We	recognise	that	welfare	and	career	development	

contribute	significantly	to	the	satisfaction	and	reputation	

of	a	workplace.	



The	results	of	our	proactive	engagement	with	employees	

show	that	there	are	no	significant	levels	of	dissatisfaction.	

During	the	year,	we	hired	336	(2018:	359;	2017:	541)	new	

employees,	contributing	to	a	new	hire	rate	of	9%	(2018:	

9%;	2017:	17%).	As	we	believe	that	a	diversified	team	

with	different	age	groups,	backgrounds,	and	skillsets	

will	bring	enriching	perspectives	to	the	workplace,	our	

new	hires	are	from	different	age	groups,	including	the	re-

employment	of	employees	above	age	50.

SML	recorded	a	total	turnover	of	424	(2018:	391;	2017:	

713)	or	an	overall	turnover	rate	of	11%	in	2019	(2018:	

10%;	2017:	18%).	SML	will	maintain	our	ongoing	effort	

and	initiatives	to	improve	our	employee’s	well-being	and	

their	satisfaction	level.	Turnover	and	turnover	rate	by	age

Family-friendly Employer

SML	prioritises	our	employees’	welfare.	We	support	

our	employees	by	providing	benefits	and	welfare	for	

employees	with	family,	including	parental	leave,	medical	

benefits,	subsidy	of	marriage	and	grievance,	etc.

In	2019,	65	eligible	female	employees	and	138	eligible	

male	employees	took	their	maternity	and	paternity	

benefits	respectively.	As	at	31	December	2019,	64	of	the

parental	leave	ended,	while	1	is	still	on	parental	leave,	

whereas	all	of	138	male	employees	have	returned	to	

work	after	their	parental	leave.	Therefore,	we	recorded	a

Respecting Freedom of Association and Collective 

Bargaining Rights

SML	respects	all	employees’	fundamental	rights	to	the	

freedom of association and the right to be members 

of trade unions. We are guided by the Indonesian 

government	regulation	(as	ratified	by	the	ILO)	which	

allows	trade	unions	to	represent	our	employees	for	

collective	bargaining,	providing	our	employees	with	an	

avenue	to	seek	redress	for	disputes.	A	total	number	

of	240	employees	(6%	of	our	total	workforce)	from	the	

Le	Grandeur	(LG)	Hotel	subsidiaries	(PT.	Sinar	Wisata	

Lestari	&amp;	PT.	Sinar	Wisata	Permai)	are	covered	by	

collective bargaining agreements. 

Above the minimum wage level

We	believe	in	providing	decent	work	remuneration.	

As	such,	our	employees	are	remunerated	based	on	

experience,	position,	and	competency.	We	strictly	comply	

with	the	minimum	wage	level	set	by	the	Government2 and 

2 The	Provincial	Wages	Council	determines	any	increase	of	Provincial	Minimum	Wages.	The	governor	then	issues	a	decree	for	each	

province.	The	current	wage	increase	is	based	on	Government	Regulation	No.	78	for	2015	stipulating	a	wage	increase	of	8.71%.

A	mandatory	Defined	Contribution	Plan	(Jaminan	Hari	

Tua)	by	BPJS	Ketenagakerjaan	is	provided	for	both	

permanent	and	non-permanent	employees	below	

the	retirement	age.	Normally,	an	additional	3.7%	

of	an	employee’s	base	salary	is	contributed	by	the	

employer	and	2%	is	deducted	from	the	employee’s	

salary.	At	SML,	we	have	decided	to	cover	both	

parts	of	this	payment.	As	of	31	December	2019,	all	

employees have been registered as BPJS Jaminan 

Hari	Tua	participants.	

 

A	mandatory	Defined	Benefit	Plan	(Jaminan	Pensiun)	

by	BPJS	Ketenagakerjaan	is	also	provided	for	both	

permanent	and	non-permanent	employees	below	the	

retirement	age.	Here,	2%	are	paid	by	the	employer	

and	1%	is	deducted	from	the	employee’s	maximum	

salary	limit	which	is	detemined	by	the	government	

regularly.	As	of	31	December	2019,	all	employees	

have been registered as BPJS Jaminan Pensiun 

participants. 

Attention to Customer and Occupational 

Health &amp; Safety

A	core	aspect	of	product	and	service	excellence	is	health	

and safety. We made customer and occupational health 

and	safety	(“OHS”)	a	priority	through	various	initiatives,	

such	as	awareness	programs	for	customers	and	tenants,	

and OHS policies for employees and contractors. We 

seek	to	minimise	risks	of	injuries,	accidents	and	illnesses	

at	our	development	projects	to	maintain	SML’s	reputation	

as a reliable developer and manager that upholds the 

highest standards of health and safety in the industry.

Ensuring Customers’ and the Public’s Well-Being

We	take	all	incidents	relating	to	our	customers’	or	general	

public’s	well-being	very	seriously.	All	health	and	safety	

incidents involving members of the public such as 

guests,	visitors,	occupants,	tenants,	and	customers	are	

reported,	and	included	in	our	Monthly	Operations	Report	

which	is	submitted	to	Division	Heads	and	the	Group	

Division	Head	(CEO).

As	part	of	our	Health,	Safety,	Environment	(“HSE”)	

awareness	program	for	tenants,	we	engage	in	several	

regular activities to promote safety in our buildings. 

These	include	HSE	socialisation,	the	placement	of	safety	

signage	in	public	spaces,	corridors	and	food	courts,	

earthquake	drills,	and	fire	drills	with	tenants	and	visitors.

ensure that all our employees are rightly compensated 

for	their	work.	As	an	equal	opportunity	employer,	there	is	

no	variation	in	minimum	wages	level	between	male	and	

female	employees.	The	chart	below	shows	the	minimum	

wage	level	used	by	SML	for	each	gender	and	operations	

locations. 

Retirement Plans and other Defined Benefits

Sinarmas	Land	complies	with	all	relevant	government	

regulations	in	the	following	ways:

1. Severance pay for retired employees in accordance 

with UU Tenaga Kerja No.13/2003

 

Under	this	Act,	an	employee	is	entitled	to	the	

following	severance	payment	from	the	employer	upon	

reaching	her	or	his	retirement	age,	based	on	their	

length of service to the company.

 

Although	this	is	not	explicitly	mentioned	as	an	

employer’s	retirement	plan,	this	severance	payment	

can	still	be	considered	as	a	‘defined	contribution	

plan’.	If	the	employer	has	their	own	defined	

contribution	program,	the	severance	amount	payable	

is	equal	to	the	difference	between	these	regulations	

and	the	employer’s	defined	contribution	program.	

Only permanent employees are eligible for these 

severance payments.

Sustainability Report 2019

In	2019,	there	were	8	injuries	and	35	dangerous	

occurrences or near misses involving members of the 

public in our buildings in our property management 

portfolio.	All	injuries	were	minor,	and	victims	were	

quickly	attended	to	and	resolved.	This	is	a	significant	

improvement	from	2018,	and	safety	continues	to	be	

an area of focus for us. An investigation is carried out 

after	each	incident,	the	results	of	which	are	reported	

in	an	incident	investigation	report,	including	follow-up	

actions	undertaken.	This	report	is	presented	during	

the	respective	SBU’s	Monthly	Operations	Meeting,	and	

actions	are	identified	to	continuously	improve	our	safety	

track	record.

Our disciplined approach to ensuring Occupational 

Health &amp; Safety

Several	OHS	initiatives	conducted	in	2019	are	as	follows:

• Regular assessments such as annual property hazard 

risk	assessments	by	ERM	team;

• Technical	and	Safety	Audits	conducted	by	SML	

Technical	Advisor	to	ensure	compliance	by	SML	

employees;

• Annual	OHS	equipment	certification	for	compliance	

with	fire	safety	standards	of	the	Indonesian	Fire	

Department;

• Annual	assessment	on	OHS	activities’	related	risk	and	

control	by	ERM	team;

• Specific	OHS-related	audit	by	Internal	Audit	as	part	of	

its annual audit; 

• Implemented OHS requirements for contractors 

during construction process;

• Included third party insurance coverage in property 

management and construction sites;

• Conducted	regular	maintenance	checking	based	on	

Equipment	Maintenance	program;

• Performed safety equipment adequacy assessment 

for	all	projects	then	addressed	equipment-related	

safety	issues	immediately	whenever	necessary;

• Performed	firefighting	and	first	aid	training	for	

Emergency	Response	Team	(ERT);

• Conducted safety socialisation for SML employees 

and tenants. 

In	addition,	SML	has	developed	and	implemented	

emergency response and crisis management plan. 

Fire drills and emergency simulations are conducted 

periodically to ensure that emergency procedures are 

understood and implemented correctly. We also conduct 

regular	trainings	and	awareness	programs	on	health	

and	safety	for	our	workforce	and	tenants.	Overall,	these	

initiatives are implemented and conducted to ensure a 

safety culture is strongly practiced in our operations.

Similar	to	customer	and	tenant	safety	protocol,	all	

incidents	are	reported	to	the	Safety	Department,	which	

will	be	included	in	the	Monthly	Operation	Report	that	

is submitted to Division Heads and the Group Division 

Head	(CEO).	For	certain	categories	of	incidents,	

such	as	breakdown	of	equipment	or	near	misses	due	

to	negligence,	a	thorough	investigation	report	with	

accompanying	follow-up	actions	will	also	be	submitted	to	

the Division Heads.

Resulting	from	our	continuous	initiatives,	we	are	pleased	

to	report	that	there	were	no	fatalities	or	any	work-related	

injuries	in	all	our	buildings	under	the	Asset	Management,	

Commercial,	and	Retail	&amp;	Hospitality	Group	Divisions.	

As part of our commitment listed in the inaugural 

sustainability	report,	we	have	started	tracking	the	lost	

days	and	total	man	hours	worked	for	both	our	employees	

and	contractors	by	gender.	We	have	also	expanded	the	

scope of our OHS data by including information from 

development projects in BSD City. 

There	were	32	work-related	injuries	in	FY2019.	All	injuries	

were	sustained	by	contractors	working	on	Southgate	

Phase 1 and 2 development projects. Most accidents 

occurred due to negligence of safety procedures by 

contract	workers,	or	misuse	of	equipment	such	as	saw,	

hammer,	AC	overcharged,	etc.	All	cases	were	minor	

or	moderate	injuries,	requiring	first-aid	level	medical	

treatment	only,	with	no	lost	days.	As	a	result	of	these	

injuries,	we	recorded	a	Rate	of	recordable	work-related	

injury rate (formerly AFR) of 9.94 and an Injury Severity 

Rate	(formerly	ASR)	of	0.47	for	our	development	projects	

in	FY2019.	In	2019,	our	number	of	injuries	increased	

due	to	the	increase	in	scope	of	our	reporting,	but	in	

particular	due	to	the	inclusion	of	high-rise	buildings,	such	

as	Southgate	Apartments.	Injury	rates	associated	with

Setting Programs to Achieve Sustainable 

Development

SML is an industrial leader in green building and a 

role model for other property companies to embrace 

and invest in “Green” concept building in Indonesia. 

We emphasise on technological innovation and 

environmental preservation to uphold our responsibility 

and	commitment	to	our	stakeholders	and	Mother	

Nature.	We	are	committed	to	developing	a	sustainable	

city guided by the Smart City theme. We also aim to 

incorporate the “Green” concept into the developments 

of our products.

Firstly,	we	will	gradually	integrate	the	management	of	

BSD	City	with	digital	initiatives	such	as	city	information	

management	system,	traffic	management	system,	

transportation system and customer care and complaint 

system to create a Smart City that can adapt and thrive 

with	constant	technological	development.	Integrated	and	

digitalised	infrastructures	can	lead	to	an	efficient	city	that	

provides a high standard of living to residents.

SML is also increasing our focus on embedding “Green” 

concepts	into	all	new	development	projects	to	address	

global	climate	and	environmental	issues.	This	is	a

strong intention by SML to ensure that our products are 

promising	long-term	investments	for	investors.	In	2019,	

we	initiated	various	projects	that	support	sustainable	

development.	Developed	on	a	26	hectares	site,	Digital	

Hub functions as a physical platform to serve the 

business and social activities of technology companies. 

Digital	Hub’s	main	objective	is	to	help	businesses	

and	institutions	succeed	within	an	environment	that	

fosters	collaboration,	social	interaction,	and	a	sense	of	

community. 

SML	will	continue	to	leverage	on	our	green	building	

expertise	and	technological	innovation	to	improve	

quality	and	value	of	our	products,	thereby	improving	

the	well-being	of	our	tenants.	BSD	Green	Office	Park	is	

a	centerpiece	of	SML’s	sustainable	development	and	

digital innovation targets and aspirations.

BSD Green Office Park

To	realise	our	commitment	in	implementing	developments	

with	an	environmental	cause,	BSD	Green	Office	Park,	

Indonesia’s	first	green	office	park,	was	developed	in	

BSD	City	with	an	area	of	25	hectares.	BSD	Green	Office	

Park	will	feature	ten	five-storey	buildings	and	a	park-

like	ambience	for	its	tenants.	BSD	Green	Office	Park	

has	complied	with	international	green	standards	for	

incorporating advanced green architectures to conserve 

energy,	water	and	natural	resources.	All	its	buildings	

maximise	sunlight	penetration	while	reducing	solar	heat,	

thus	boosting	energy	efficiencies,	and	optimising	air	

circulation.	For	its	eco-friendly	practices,	BSD	Green	

Office	Park	has	received	the	Green	Mark	Gold	Award	

from	Singapore’s	BCA.

In	May	2013,	BSD	Green	Office	Park	was	awarded	with	

the	Gold	Award	in	the	World	FIABCI	Prix	d’Excellence	

Award	in	Taiwan	under	the	Category	Sustainable	

Development.	In	2012,	our	BSD	Green	Office	Park	

received	the	International	Property	Award	Asia	Pacific	

2012	for	Office	Development.	It	is	also	the	first	office	

district	in	Indonesia	to	be	certified	as	a	‘Gold’	Green	

district	by	Singapore’s	Building	Construction	Authority	

(BCA).	These	achievements	are	testaments	to	SML’s

Sustainability Report 2019

The	consistent	implementation	of	green	building	

standards	in	three	of	our	flagship	properties	has	

allowed	us	to	achieve	significant	improvements	in	our	

environmental	impact.	Encouraged	by	these	results,	we	

have	selected	several	new	office	buildings	to	be	certified	

with	the	same	green	standards	and	look	forward	to	report	

on their progress in our future reports. 

For	our	other	existing	buildings	within	BSD	City,	we	will	

consider implementing parts of these green standards 

guidelines,	wherever	feasible.	We	also	strive	to	

increasingly implement green building initiatives in our 

development	projects	and	existing	buildings	managed	by	

SML	to	further	our	aspirations	to	be	a	best-in-class	real	

estate developer.

Case Study - Green Building





Sinarmas	Land’s	Green	Building	initiative	highlights	

the	Group’s	dedication	and	investment	in	sustainable	

development. Green building is a solution by SML in 

response	to	the	community’s	increasing	demand	for	

environmental-friendly	office	buildings	with	modern	

designs and the best facilities situated in strategic and 

accessible	locations.	This	initiative	is	a	testament	to	

our commitments to support nature conservation by 

designing buildings that are environmentally friendly and 

energy-efficient	following	the	Green	District	concept.	

Green District concept encourages developments and 

buildings	that	are	environmentally,	economically	and	

aesthetically	sound.	On	a	grander	scale,	the	Green	

Building	initiative	also	addresses	climate	change,	as	well	

as resource scarcity issues:

•	 Energy	and	water	savings	which	reduce	energy	and	

water	consumptions,	thus	reducing	the	company’s	

operational cost;

•	 Low	carbon	emissions	generated	from	building	

energy;

•	 Zero	run	off	technology	with	water	recycle	system	and	

rainwater	harvesting	system;

• Less harmful for ozone (do not use ozone depleting 

substances).

For	SML’s	internal	operation,	opting	for	green	building	

design	will	lower	operational	cost	in	the	long	run	as	

aforementioned (although it requires a higher investment 

in	the	initial	development	stage).	The	use	of	energy	

efficient	material	such	as	LED	lights,	automatic	toilet	

flush,	and	air	conditioner	with	automatic	temperature	

adjustments	are	energy	and	water	efficient	methods	to	

reduce	SML’s	buildings’	monthly	operational	cost.	

Best in Class Real Estate

In	total,	the	Group	currently	has	five	buildings	within	

its	portfolio	with	Green	Building	Certification,	three	

of	which	are	part	of	the	Green	Office	Park.	We	have	

made	significant	progress	between	2018	and	2019.	

We	obtained	green	certification	for	Sinar	Mas	Land	

Plaza	–	Jakarta	in	2018.	In	2019,	we	have	completed	the	

development	of	GOP	1	and	obtained	green	certification	

from	Greenmark.

What is Green Building?

Green	building	(also	known	as	green	construction	or	

sustainable building) refers to both a structure and 

the application of processes that are environmentally 

responsible	and	resource-efficient	throughout	a	

building’s	lifecycle:	from	planning	to	design,	construction,	

operation,	maintenance,	renovation,	and	demolition.	

This	requires	close	cooperation	with	the	contractors,	

architects,	engineers,	and	client	during	the	entire	

development.	The	Green	Building	practice	adds	values	

to conventional building design through green features. 

These	new	features	can	increase	buildings’	economic	

value	as	well	as	improve	their	utility,	durability	and	

comforts of living by being environmentally friendly. 

Green Building Criteria 

Based	on	Greenship	New	Building	Concept	Version	1.2	

issued	by	GBCI	(Green	Building	Council	Indonesia),	the	

six	criteria	of	Green	Buildings	include:


43

Sinarmas Land Limited

Sustainability Report 2019

1. Appropriate Site Development (ASD) 

 

Maintain	or	expand	the	greening	of	town/surrounding	

to	enhance	environmental	quality,	reducing	direct	

runoff drainage system from overload pressure and 

minimise	the	impact	on	ground	water	systems	for	

building use.

2.	 Energy	Efficiency	and	Conservation	(EEC)	

 

Active monitoring and recording practices to reduce  

energy consumption through the application of 

energy	efficient	measures	such	as	minimising	lamps	

with	external	lighting	and	reducing	the	use	of	air	

conditioners	with	designs	and	materials	that	can	

reduce heat. 

3. Water Conservation 

 

To	minimise	the	usage	of	groundwater.	Water	

conservation	devices	such	as	water	recycle	system	

or	rainwater	harvesting	system	are	installed.	These	

systems	are	equipped	with	auto-	discharge	function	

on	the	hand	washer	or	use	recycled	water	for	flushing	

toilet.

4. Material Resources &amp; Cycles 

 

The	use	of	recycled	materials	to	reduce	production	

waste,	the	use	of	new	raw	materials,	extend	lifespans	

of	existing	material	substances,	and	prevent	the	use	

of materials that have Ozone Depletion Potential 

(ODP) and ODS equal to or greater and to reduce the 

use	of	new	raw	materials.

5. Indoor Health &amp; Comfort / Air Quality &amp; Comfort

						To	maintain	and	improve	indoor	air	quality	by	the	

introduction of outdoor air including monitoring 

the	concentration	of	carbon	dioxide,	and	reducing	

environmental and air pollution.

6. Building Environmental &amp; Management

 

To	manage	the	processes	of	a	Green	Building	design	

from early stages to facilitate and ensure that the 

development of the design meets the necessary 

standards and quality to preserve and protect the 

environment

As	required	in	Green	Building	criteria,	these	green	

features are featured prominently in our Green Building 

•	 Every	building	was	developed	with	high	energy	and	

water	efficiency,	uses	LED	lamps	and	photovoltaic	

panels for street lighting.

•	 Zero	run	off	technology,	with	rainwater	harvesting	

tanks	on	each	building,	natural	and	modern	infiltration	

wells,	and	a	large	lake	used	for	rainwater	retention	

and	irrigation.	Currently,	we	are	in	the	process	of	

improving	our	rainwater	harvesting	system	with	the	

initial design discussion and budget calculations 

being	completed	in	FY2018.	The	implementation	of	

this	new	system	is	being	undertaken	by	contractor.



Green	Office	Park	1	(GOP	1)


44

Sinarmas Land Limited

Sustainability Report 2019

Specifically,	our	BSD	Green	Office	Park	epitomises	our	

commitment to realising more Green Buildings in our 

operation: 

•	 Each	building	in	BSD	Green	Office	Park	optimises	

passive design to reduce thermal heat such as overall 

thermal	transfer	value	(OTTV)	design	below	45	Watt/

m2,	and	using	Computational	Fluid	Dynamics	(CFD)	to	

analyse climate change in this district.

•	 80%	of	the	buildings	have	a	north-south	facing	

orientation	within	22.5	degrees	of	the	east/west	

axis	and	are	aerodynamically	shaped	to	catch	the	

prevailing	west	and	south-west	winds.

•	 Integrated	connectivity,	supporting	facilities	and	

transportation	systems	(shuttle	bus,	bicycle	tracks,	

etc.),	and	the	availability	of	pedestrian	tracks.

•	 Maintenance	of	large	green-open	landscape	spaces	

between	buildings	and	green	roofs	on	most	buildings	

to reduce heat island effect.

Key challenges

Challenges:

•	 A	key	challenge	in	implementing	and	advocating	for	

the	increasing	use	of	green	building	is	the	awareness,	

or	lack	thereof,	on	the	importance	of	green	building	

development to support climate action and 

sustainable	development.	Most	players	in	Indonesia’s	

property	industry	(building	owners,	consultants,	

contractors	and	the	government)	are	not	fully	aware	

of	the	potentials	and	benefits	of	green	concept	in	

buildings	development.	Therefore,	socialisation,	

education	and	awareness	of	green	building	and	

development	need	to	be	promoted	among	key	

industry players to elevate green concept to be a 

common industrial norm and practice.

•	 Next,	there	is	also	reluctance	among	building	owners	

in	Jakarta	and	Tangerang	area	to	implement	green	

buildings.	This	is	due	to	the	lack	of	implementation	of	

green	building	regulation	in	Jakarta	and	Tangerang	

area.	Also,	the	lack	of	incentives	offered	by	the	

government to companies to build and implement 

green building has also led to their reluctance as 

green building generally requires a higher capital 

investment in the initial stages. 

How to Overcome:

•	 As	a	leader	in	the	real	estate	industry,	SML	through	

its	representative	role	in	Real	Estate	Indonesia	(REI)	

association,	engaged	with	regulatory	authorities	to	

improve green building regulations and promote 

incentives to encourage the development of more 

green	building	in	Indonesia,	especially	in	Jakarta	and	

Tangerang	area.

Opportunity for improvement

• SML recognises that the impacts of green building 

can	be	further	amplified	if	building	occupants	–	being	

employees,	tenants	and	other	building	occupants	-	

develop and practice green habits to complement 

with	the	green	features	that	the	building	possesses.

•	 Currently,	SML	has	initiated	the	Green	Habit	1.0	

program for three green buildings (Sinar Mas Land 

Plaza	–	BSD	City,	MyRepublic	Plaza,	GOP	9)	which	

focuses	on	energy	and	water	efficiency.	This	program	

can	potentially	be	expanded	to	other	SML	buildings	

and tenants. 

•	 Going	forward,	SML	is	preparing	to	launch	the	Green	

Habit	2.0	program	which	focuses	on	reducing	plastic

Sustainability Report 2019

Compliance to All Related Regulatory 

Requirements 

We	placed	a	strong	emphasis	on	complying	with	the	

regulatory	frameworks	set	up	on	the	national	and	regional	

level.	These	include	regulations	on	land	acquisition,	

operational	permits,	design	and	construction,	finance	

and	accounting,	labour	laws,	customer	protection,	and	

environmental	frameworks.	We	have	a	zero-tolerance	

approach	towards	corruption	throughout	Sinarmas	Land’s	

organisation.

We	are	pleased	to	report	that	there	were	no	reported	

incidents	of	corruption	in	FY2019.	In	addition,	no	public	

legal	cases	regarding	corruption	were	brought	against	

the	Group,	or	its	subsidiaries,	and	no	contracts	with	

business partners had to be terminated due to violations 

related to corruption.

Through	the	engagement	of	external	consultants,	we	are	

actively	educating	our	employees	to	be	more	aware	of	

fraud	related	risk	management,	how	to	address	issues	

relating	to	corruption	(e.g.	conflicts	of	interest,	bribery,	

illegal	gratuities,	extortion),	asset	misappropriation	

(e.g.	cash,	inventory	and	other	assets),	and	accounting	

fraud (e.g. asset or revenue over/understatement). In 

December	2019,	we	conducted	Fraud	&amp;	Anti-Corruption	

seminars	for	selected	department	heads	and	look	

to	extend	these	seminars	to	all	staff	in	management	

positions.

All	newly	hired	staff	are	inducted	with	SML’s	core	values	

and the policies listed above in mandatory orientation 

training	courses	which	include	New	Hires	Introduction	&amp;	

SML Shared Values. 

When	we	identify	shortcomings	in	current	regulations,	

such	as	in	waste	management,	we	proactively	engage	

the relevant authorities and collaboratively develop 

solutions	and	frameworks	to	ensure	the	well-being	of	the	

communities	we	operate	in.

Our employees have received clear guidance on 

the standards of ethical behaviour required of them 

through	our	Code	of	Conduct	policy,	supplemented	by	

our	whistle-blowing	policy	that	serves	as	an	effective	

oversight	measure	for	the	prevention	of	fraud,	corruption	

and	other	types	of	misconduct.	Also,	we	have	policies	

in place that cover procurement activities and fair 

employment	practices.	In	the	meantime,	we	are	working	

to	strengthen	our	governance	framework	to	explicitly	

address	environment,	health	and	safety	issues.	Going	

forward,	we	will	make	details	of	these	policies	known	to	

the public. 

In	addition,	we	continue	to	build	on	our	policy	for	

procurement activities to eventually develop it into a 

mandatory Supplier Code of Conduct. We are adopting 

a	phased	approach,	focusing	our	initiatives	on	key	

suppliers	and	vendors	of	our	value	chain.	In	2019,	

we	implemented	new	environmental	requirements	on	

suppliers,	contractors	or	vendors	of	key	products	and	

services.	These	requirements	include:

•	 ISO	14001	certification	for	suppliers	of	our	

construction	and	building	materials	such	as	cement,	

steel,	aluminium,	glass,	gypsum,	indoor	paint,	tiles,	

and sanitary materials;

•	 Legal	certification	for	our	wood	suppliers,	as	required	

by the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry; 

• A minimum percentage of recycled content in 

materials supplied by our steel and cement/concrete 

suppliers.

Responsible	marketing	is	another	important	aspect	of	our	

work	to	ensure	compliance	with	all	relevant	regulations.	

We	have	worked	hard	over	the	last	47	years	to	build	

a reputation as a reliable partner to a multitude of 

stakeholders,	including	the	government,	customers	and	

communities	we	operate	in.	A	critical	part	of	preserving	

our	standing	with	these	stakeholders	is	to	market	our	

developments appropriately and accurately. 

We	are	pleased	to	report	that	in	2019,	there	were:

Zero	incidents	of	non-compliance	concerning	marketing	

communications	and	product	information.	There	were	

0

reported	cases	of	non-compliance	concerning:

following:

• Sustainability initiatives have been fully integrated 

into	our	governance	structure,	including	the	Board’s	

active	involvement	through	the	Risk	Committee,	Audit	

Committee	and	other	ad-hoc	meetings;

• Other	than	the	minor	exceedances	in	the	Biochemical	

Oxygen	Demand	(“BOD”)	of	our	effluents	in	QBig	

Mall	and	Wisma	BCA,	which	did	not	result	in	any	

penalisation	or	fines	by	the	government,	there	were	no	

other	incidents	of	non-compliance	with	any	relevant	

environmental	and	social	regulatory	frameworks;

• We	have	started	to	expand	the	scope	of	our	

sustainability reporting to include other SML projects 

(please refer to page 15 in section ‘About this

Environmental Compliance

Given	our	ever-growing	scope,	we	are	subjected	to	the	

most	stringent	environmental	regulatory	frameworks	in	

Indonesia.

As	part	of	our	environmental	compliance,	based	on	

Government	Regulation	No.	27	in	2012	on	Environment	

Control	Permits,	we	are	required	to	submit	an	extensive	

Environment	Management	and	Monitoring	Effort	(UKL/

UPL)	report	every	six	months.	Within	the	report,	it	spells	

out	the	specific	limits	for	every	aspect	of	environmental	

impacts	(e.g.	water,	waste,	etc.)	and	we	are	to	ensure	

that	our	operations	must	not	breach	these	limits.	The	

report is submitted directly to the regional government 

and subject to government approval.

For	its	ongoing	operational	permit,	SML	also	has	to	

comply	with	several	HSE	regulations	such	as	liquid	waste	

management,	fire	safety	certification,	and	equipment	

licenses.	The	related	authorities	will	perform	audits	on	our	

operational	feasibility	and	issue	permit	certificates	only	

upon	compliance	with	these	requirements.

Other	than	the	minor	exceedances	in	BOD	of	our	

effluents	which	did	not	result	in	any	penalisation	or	fines	

by	the	government,	we	are	pleased	to	report	that	there	

were	no	incidents	of	environmental	non-compliance	

during the reporting period.

Climate Change &amp; The Environment

In this section 

This	section	of	the	report	looks	at	the	various	ways	in	

which	SML’s	operations	impact	climate	change	and	

the	wider	environment,	and	lays	out	our	commitment	to	

minimise	these	impacts.	We	have	identified	the	following	

key	area	of	focus:

1. Optimising Building Operation to achieve clean 

environment

2. Providing and maintaining Green Open Space

3. Providing and facilitating various type of public 

transportation

4.	 Responsible	waste	management	program

Covered in this section are:

• Our efforts to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) 

emissions,	and	improve	energy	efficiency,	associated	

with	our	developments	and	support	the	Indonesian	

government’s	commitment	to	the	Paris	Agreement;

• Main materials used at our construction sites;

• Our	water	usage	along	with	data	on	our	effluents	and	

discharges generated;

• Statistics	on	waste	created	and	how	we	handled	it.

In	2019,	we	monitored	the	progress	of	all	these	

environmental performance through the analysis of data 

collected. As mentioned in “Our Approach” section on 

page	20,	these	topics	are	classified	into	development	or	

property management stages according to their impacts 

in each stage:

• Development: materials

• Property	management:	energy,	water,	emissions,	and	

effluents	and	waste

In	addition,	we	have	also	classified	environmental	data	of	

our property management portfolios into four categories 

At Sinarmas Land, we understand the significant impact of climate change

and strive to protect the surrounding environment through policies and

existing programs. We are a founding corporate member of the non-profit 

organisation “Green Building Council Indonesia” since its establishment

in 2009. Our key role in the council is to ensure that our property 

development activities are sustainable and environment friendly.

part of a transparent and model company that represents 

the	best	of	Indonesia.	More	importantly,	we	want	to	

showcase	our	ability	and	dedication	towards	sustainable	

development	by	creating	and	providing	efficient	and	

optimal	buildings	and	infrastructures,	and	managing	

services to achieve clean environment.

SML strives to optimise our building operations from 

development to management stages to create and 

provide cleaner environment for the lives of residents. 

We develop and apply principles of sustainability to 

office	buildings,	in-line	with	international	green	building	

standards.	As	a	result,	we	brought	positive	impacts	

to the surrounding environment through leading edge 

sustainability practices. We are constantly developing 

new	ideas	and	initiatives	to	realise	more	green	buildings	

and properties. 

We	have	also	embarked	on	a	sustainability	program	

with	specific	responsibilities	assigned	to	staff	across	all	

parts	of	the	organisation.	As	part	of	this	program,	we	

will	be	able	to	better	calculate	and	eventually	increase	

the	percentage	of	recycled	input	materials,	reduce	the	

energy required in the construction and operation of our 

developments,	lower	our	water	consumption	and	carbon	

emissions,	as	well	as	improve	our	waste	management.	

Aside	from	these	initiatives,	below	are	some	highlights	of	

our	environmental	initiatives	in	2019:

LOCAL COMMUNITY PROGRAM

1 Green Habit 2.0 “Less Plastic” Program

In	2019,	SML	launched	the	Green	Habit	2.0	“Less	Plastic”	

program that focuses on substituting plastic bottles 

with	paper	cups	/	tumblers	in	BSD	Office	Buildings	

and	residential	areas.	SML	has	partnered	with	Tzu	Chi	

Foundation	in	collecting	plastic	waste	from	several	

residential	clusters	in	BSD	City	and	office	buildings	such	

Climate Change &amp; The Environment

as	the	Wisma	BCA	and	GOP.	The	Green	Habit	program	

has	been	implemented	in	several	BSD	City’s	residential	

clusters	such	as	Victoria	River	Park	and	Green	Cove.	

Since	the	program	began,	SML	has	succeeded	in	halving	

the	usage	in	its	offices	to	5,446	cartons	of	400	ml	mineral	

water	plastic	bottles,	or	an	equivalent	of	130,704	bottles.

2 BSD Green Festival 2019

In	line	with	World	Environment	Day,	SML	held	the	16th	

Green	Festival	together	with	600	Junior	School	students	

from	BSD	City	in	2019.	This	activity	was	also	marked	with	

the	installation	of	100	biopori	holes,	hereby	showcasing	

SML’s	commitment	to	preserve	the	environment.	

The	event	was	attended	by	local	government	and	

sustainability	association,	Indonesia	Global	Compact	

Network	(IGCN).

3 1,000 Mangrove Trees Planting Events

Karawang	International	Industrial	City	(KIIC)	is	working	

together	with	the	local	government	to	prevent	sea	water	

abrasion	around	the	coastal	area	in	Karawang	Regency.	

In	2019,	KIIC	planted	1,000	mangrove	trees	at	Karawang	

Regency to preserve the environment and prevent sea 

water	abrasion.	In	addition,	upon	maturity,	the	mangrove	

ecosystem	will	support	the	growth	of	marine	animals	

and	amphibious,	as	well	as	adding	the	development	of	

sustainability	tourism	within	the	area.	

4 Telaga Desa Agro Enviro Education Park

Designated	as	a	Biological	Variety	Park	spanning	over	3	

hectares	of	land	near	KIIC,	Village	Lake	(“Telaga	Desa”)

Materials

As	one	of	Indonesia’s	leading	real	estate	developers,	

we	recognised	that	all	our	developments,	which	include	

buildings,	supporting	amenities	and	infrastructures	have	

significant	impact	on	the	environment.	In	2019,	concrete,	

sand,	and	steel	are	three	of	the	most	consumed	materials	

used by us. 

to	the	significant	expansion	of	this	year’s	reporting	scope,	

our	materials	used	data	reported	a	significant	increase.	

In	particular,	we	saw	a	significant	growth	in	the	usage	of	

steel,	as	steel	is	required	in	the	early	stages	of	foundation	

building across our development projects.

We	use	concrete	with	recycled	content	and	aim	to	

gradually build our internal monitoring capacity to 

include other consumable materials and their respective 

consumed	quantities	in	our	internal	watch-list,	and	have	

them reported in the subsequently reports. We continue 

to abide by relevant environmental regulations to promote 

transparency and accountability in our supply chain.

Energy

The	built-up	environment	consumes	significant	amounts	

of	energy.	In	the	region	where	BSD	City	is	located,	

energy is predominantly generated from the burning of 

fossil	fuels	that	contribute	significantly	to	our	greenhouse	

gas emissions. Adhering to internationally recognised 

green	building	standards,	such	as	the	Singapore	BCA	

Green	Mark	standard,	we	can	direct	our	effort	towards	

achieving	greater	energy	efficiency	and	reducing	energy	

usage throughout the project lifecycle. 

As	we	significantly	expanded	the	scope	of	our	

sustainability	data	and	report	this	year,	all	of	our	reported	

buildings energy consumption has increased. Our 

buildings energy consumption and intensity by GFA 

Occupied	are	depicted	in	the	following	graphs	and	

tables.	The	graphs	are	depicted	based	on	buildings	with	

targets	(Green	and	High-rise	buildings)	and	buildings	

without	targets	(Rest	of	Buildings	and	Trade	Centres).

In	line	with	SML’s	Sustainability	Vision,	the	Group	is	

actively	encouraging	occupancy	in	our	green	office	

buildings	as	we	seek	to	reduce	environmental	footprint,	

mitigate	climate	change,	and	improve	the	well-being	of	

occupants.	In	2019,	our	Green	Buildings’	GFA	remained	

at	78,821m2	while	GFA	Occupied	increased	by	1%	

from	55,278	m2	in	2018	to	56,107	m2	in	2019.	We	are	

pleased	to	report	that	our	commitment	towards	the	

development and use of green buildings have actualised 

and	continued	to	yield	positive	results.	Green	Buildings’	

energy	consumption	decreased	by	4%	from	8,369,770	

kWh	in	2018	to	8,069,480	kWh	in	2019.	Energy	intensity	

by	GFA	occupied	also	decreased	by	5%	from	151.41	

kWh/m2	in	2018	to	143.82	kWh/m2	in	2019.	This	is	still	

well	below	the	Energy	Consumption	Index	or	‘Indeks

and	the	usage	of	energy-efficient	LED	lightbulbs.	

For	our	green	buildings	in	BSD	City,	we	target	to	

achieve a further total overall energy intensity reduction 

of	5%	for	the	next	8	years	with	2017	as	the	base	

year.	This	reduction	will	be	achieved	mainly	through	

the implementation of our Green Habit Program 

which	encourages	employees	to	reduce	their	energy	

consumption	in	their	respective	workplaces.	We	

have	also	set	target	for	our	high-rise	office	building	in	

Jakarta	(Sinar	Mas	Land	Plaza	–	Jakarta	and	Sinarmas	

MSIG	Tower)	to	achieve	a	total	overall	energy	intensity	

reduction	of	3%	for	the	next	8	years	with	2019	as	the	

base	year.	Going	forward,	SML	plans	to	introduce	more	

initiatives to support the achievement of these targets.

Highlight: Energy Efficiency Initiatives 

for SML Office High Rise Building 

(Jakarta Area)

We have several energy efficiency initiatives for 

our office high rise buildings: Sinar Mas Land Plaza 

– Jakarta and Sinarmas MSIG Tower. In 2017, 

Sinar Mas Land Plaza – Jakarta has replaced its 

chiller to optimise the air-conditioning system to 

that with lower energy consumption. This initiative 

was in line with Greenmark’s requirements. 

Thereafter, the building was awarded with green 

building certification in 2018. In 2019, we plan to 

replace Sinarmas MSIG Tower’s chiller plant valve 

to optimise water pump for chiller and adjusting 

the coolling tower fan adjustment to optimise 

the appropriate fan cycle. These initiatives are 

scheduled to be completed in 2020.

Water

Water	is	a	precious	resource.	Thus,	there	is	a	need	

for us to monitor our impact carefully in order to avoid 

and	mitigate	harmful	effects	from	excessive	water	

consumption,	and	the	discharge	of	effluents	into	natural	

water	systems.

Our	buildings’	main	water	consumption	source	is	the	

municipal	water	supply.	Due	to	the	significant	increase	

in	scope,	our	total	municipal	water	consumption	for	

each	category	also	increased.	Our	buildings’	water	

consumption and consumption intensities by GFA 

Occupied	are	depicted	in	the	following	graph	and	tables.		

The	graphs	are	depicted	based	on	buildings	with	targets	

(Green	and	High-rise	buildings)	and	buildings	without	

targets	(Rest	of	Buildings	and	Trade	Centres).

In	2019,	our	Green	Buildings’	GFA	remained	at	78,821	

m2	while	GFA	Occupied	increased	by	1%	from	55,278	

m2		in	2018	to	56,107	m2	in	2019.	We	are	pleased	to	

report	that	our	commitment	towards	the	development	and	

use of green buildings have actualised and continued 

to	yield	positive	results.	Municipal	water	consumption	

for	our	green	buildings	decreased	by	16%	from	84,885	

m3	in	2018	to	71,687	m3	in	2019.	Water	intensity	by	GFA	

occupied	also	decreased	by	17%	from	1.54	m3/m2  in 

2018	to	1.28	m3/m2		in	2019.

In	2019,	we	have	set	new	targets	for	our	high-rise	office	

buildings,	namely	Sinar	Mas	Land	Plaza	–	Jakarta	and	

Sinarmas	MSIG	Tower.	Using	2019	as	the	base	year,	we	

began	to	track	and	monitor	environmental	performances	

of	our	high-rise	buildings.	High-rise	buildings’	municipal	

water	consumption	was	190,406	m3.	Municipal	water	

intensity	by	GFA	Occupied	was	1.20	m3/m2.

Due	to	the	significant	scope	expansion,	municipal	water	

consumption for the rest of our buildings increased by 

80%	from	389,543	m3	in	2018	to	702,678	m3	in	2019.	

Municipal	water	intensity	by	GFA	occupied	increased	by	

44%	from	1.47	m3/m2	in	2018	to	2.13	m3/m2	in	2019.

Trade	centres	experienced	the	highest	increase	in	

municipal	water	consumption	and	intensity	by	GFA	

occupied	due	to	the	significant	increase	in	scope.

Trade	centres’	GFA	increased	from	100,788	m2 in

2018	to	1,553,216	m2	in	2019.	As	a	result,	municipal	

water	consumption	increased	by	1,401%	96,844	m3/m2

in	2018	to	1,453,837	m3/m2	in	2019.	However,	trade	

centres’	municipal	water	consumption	intensity	by	GFA	

occupied	increased	by	11%	from	1.00	m3/m2	in	2018

to 1.11 m3/m2	in	2019.

Highlight: Biopori Program Initiative 

Other than development initiatives and plans, we 

also conducted green initiatives in communities 

by spreading messages to encourage 

environmental conservation and creating more 

green spaces. In 2019, we continued our 

CSR tree planting initiatives and encouraged 

communities to plant trees through biopori 

holes. We have set a target of planting trees 

through 17,916 biopori holes in the next 3 years 

from 2019. This initiative is intended to involve 

volunteers from residential and commercial 

property management divisions to educate 

tenants and residents on the importance of 

creating and maintaining a green environment.

In 2019, 1,000 volunteers from BSD City and 

KIIC participated in this initiative. A total of 4,392 

trees were planted including biopori holes.





Providing and Maintaining Green Open 

Space

Sinarmas Land consistently includes Green Open Space 

(Ruang Terbuka Hijau,	RTH)	in	every	development	

Master	Plan	design.	At	the	end	of	2019,	SML	has	a	total	

of	4,159,513	m2	of	RTH.	As	part	of	our	residential	and	

commercial	3	years	plan,	we	have	set	a	target	to	have	

1,420,110	m2	of	RTH	in	the	next	3	years	using	2019	as	

baseline	year.	This	practice	is	in	line	with	our	sustainable	

development	targets,	as	well	as	complementing	our	

green	buildings	with	green	spaces.	The	creation,	

provision and utilisation of Green Open Space are 

intended to: 

•	 Ensure	the	availability	of	sufficient	space	for	

conservation areas for hydrological preservation;

• Serve as pollutant reduction areas in urban areas; 

and 

• Serve as a recreational and sports facilities for 

surrounding communities to create a healthy living 

environment.

There	are	several	areas	included	in	SML’s	Green	Open	

Space category:

•	 City	Park	and	Pond	Area;

• Public Green Area;

• Commercial Lot Green area;

• Residential Green Area;

Highlight: Water Efficiency Initiatives 

for SML Office High Rise Building 

(Jakarta Area)

In 2011, Sinar Mas Land Plaza – Jakarta upgraded 

its sanitary system (such as valve supply setting 

to janitor &amp; Air Handling Unit, auto-faucet sink and 

censored-urinal flushing for toilet), and improved 

its water sewage system such as installing Water 

Treatment Plant (WTP) in Sewage Treatment 

Plant (STP). Sinar Mas Land Plaza – Jakarta also 

installed a system for the separation of closet 

flushing and washer water supply. In 2018 and 

2019, water from WTP was used for cooling tower 

and closet flushing. These initiatives have reduced 

50% of the building’s water consumption from 2011 

to 2019. Similar initiatives will be implemented for 

Sinarmas MSIG Tower in 2020 and is expected to 

optimise Sinarmas MSIG tower’s water recycling 

system.

Some	of	our	initiatives	in	2019	are	as	follows:

BSD	Link	bus	implementation	in	the	BSD	City	area.	

Integrated	with	BSD	Intermoda	Modern	Market,	there	are	

currently	14	BSD	Link	buses	being	deployed	to	operate	6	

routes.	In	the	future,	BSD	Link	will	expand	its	operations	

to cover the entire BSD City.

The	public	transport	is	also	integrated	with	Modern	

Market	Intermoda	Terminal,	Cisauk	Train	Station	and	

with	other	city	(inter-regional)	public	transport	networks	

(e.g.	buses	from	Bogor	and	Tangerang,	buses	to	airport	

&amp;	MRT	station)	to	provide	wider	access	for	people	

commuting	to	and	from	BSD	City,	especially	SML’s	

business centre. 

Revitalisation	of	the	Cisauk	Train	Station	in	2018	to	

provide easy access to train passengers from the station 

to various parts of BSD City via BSD Intermoda Modern 

Market.	The	newly	renovated	station	can	accommodate	a	

larger number of commuters and encourages higher train 

ridership	in	and	out	of	BSD	City.	Train	transportation	is	a	

lower	carbon	alternative	to	other	modes	of	transportation.

Providing and Facilitating Various Type of 

Public Transportation

Efficient	public	transportation	infrastructure	is	a	key	

component of a sustainable city. Sinarmas Land 

aspires	to	play	a	significant	role	in	elevating	Jakarta	

to become a model sustainable city by contributing 

to	the	development	of	the	city’s	public	transportation	

infrastructure.	We	recognise	that	we	have	a	role	in	

encouraging the use of public transport in each of our 

operational	areas.	By	developing	this	infrastructure,	we	

aim to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and air 

pollutions	caused	by	private	vehicles	to	make	Jakarta	a	

greener city.

Case Study: Public Transportation in

BSD Area

BSD	City	is	a	satellite	and	modern	city	with	a	vision	

to create comfortable and healthy living spaces for 

residents.	To	achieve	this	vision,	SML	strives	to	provide	

BSD	City	with	better	modes	of	integrated	public	transport.	

The	objective	of	this	initiative	is	to	encourage	the	use	of	

public transport and to reduce emissions generated from 

private	vehicles.	The	development	of	public	transport	is	

also	accompanied	by	development	of	environmental-

friendly	public	facilities,	such	as	wide	pedestrian	

walkways,	bus	stops	and	shelters,	green	spaces,	and	

park	and	ride	facilities.

New Interconnecting Transport Facility in BSD City



Sinarmas	Land	has	partnered	with	Grab	Holdings	Inc.	

(“Grab”),	a	Southeast-Asia	super	app,	to	provide	smart	

and	clean	mobility	solutions	that	seeks	to	also	support	

growth	of	micro	and	small	business.	The	initiative	is	

also intended to drive technology development to 

strengthen	BSD	City’s	goal	as	the	first	integrated	smart	

city	in	Indonesia.	The	collaboration	with	Grab	is	also	to	

encourage employees and visitors in BSD City to use 

Grab as a form of public transportation:

• Grab for Business (GFB): Discount for employees 

who	use	Grab	transportation	for	business	trip;

•	 Grab	Lane:	Dedicated	Grab	pick-up	points	in	Modern	

Market	BSD	City;

•	 GrabWheels:	Grab	and	SML	launched	their	first	

innovative	mobility	solution,	GrabWheels,	that	uses	

environmental-friendly	e-scooters	for	short	distance	

travel.	Scooters	can	be	rented	by	employees,	tenants	

or	visitors	in	BSD	Green	Office	Park	area	to	commute	

within	the	area.	GrabWheels	forms	part	of	BSD	City’s	

multimodal	transportation	system,	a	key	development	

for a green smart city.

 

Our commitment to develop public transportation 

infrastructures and services is primarily driven by our 

goals to create a comfort and healthy living environment 

for our residents and surrounding communities through 

the reduction of private vehicles usage and emissions. 

In	addition,	these	alternative	transportation	modes	will	

greatly improve the mobility of our residents in BSD City 

and	the	surrounding	areas.	All	of	these	are	expected	to	

significantly	improve	business	activities	within	BSD	City	

as	city	dwellers	have	better	access	to	the	city’s	business	

centre.

Key Challenges &amp; Solutions:

While	the	number	of	commuters	who	uses	BSD	Link	

continue	to	increase	in	2019,	the	amount	has	yet	to	

meet	our	expected	targets	(approximately	37.5%	of	the	

targeted	population	uses	BSD	Link).	This	is	due	to	higher	

preference	of	using	private	vehicles	or	private	ride-hailing	

services	such	as	Grab	or	Gojek.	BSD	City	Township	

Management	has	collaborated	with	our	Marketing	and	

Corporate Communication team to actively promote BSD 

Link	through	various	media	platforms	such	as	flyers,	

brochure,	video	Tron,	websites	and	social	media	outlets	

to attract more passengers.

• Improve	supporting	facilities,	such	as	bus	stops	and	

shelters,	to	provide	better	service	to	passengers	while	

waiting	for	buses;

• Integrate	BSD	Link	information	in	one	mobile	

application (similar to SML One Smile System) that 

can	provide	up	to-date	information	on	bus	location,	

capacity,	routes,	etc.;

• Expand	the	collaboration	with	technology	companies	

that	provide	ride-hailing	transport	services,	such	as	

Grab	or	Gojek,	to	capture	the	need	of	commuters;

• Implement similar modes of transportation in other 

SML’s	areas	of	operation,	integrating	them	with	the	

transport system in BSD City area.

In	2019,	our	Green	Buildings’	GFA	remained	at	78,821

in	2018	to	56,107	m2	in	2019.	We	are	pleased	to	report	

that	our	commitment	towards	the	development	and	

use of green buildings have actualised and continued 

to yield positive results. GHG emissions for our green 

buildings	decreased	by	3%	from	5,978	tonnes	of	CO2e in 

2018	to	5,804	tonnes	of	CO2e	in	2019.	Green	buildings’	

overall GHG emissions intensity by GFA occupied also 

decreased	by	4%	from	0.1081	tonnes	of	CO2e/m2	in	2018	

to	0.1034	tonnes	of	CO2e/m2	in	2019.

In	2019,	we	have	set	new	targets	for	our	high-rise	office	

buildings,	namely	Sinar	Mas	Land	Plaza	–	Jakarta	and	

Sinarmas	MSIG	Tower.	Using	2019	as	the	base	year,	we	

began	to	track	and	monitor	environmental	performances	

of	our	high-rise	buildings.	High-rise	buildings’	GHG	

emissions	was	19,702	tonnes	of	CO2e.	Emissions

Sinarmas Land Limited

Sustainability Report 2019

For	our	green	buildings	in	BSD	City,	we	target	to	

further achieve a total overall emission reduction of 

5%	over	the	next	8	years,	with	2017	as	the	base	year.	

These	reductions	will	be	achieved	mainly	through	the	

implementation of our Green Habit Program. We have 

also	set	targets	for	our	high-rise	office	building	in	Jakarta	

(Sinar	Mas	Land	Plaza	–	Jakarta	and	Sinarmas	MSIG	

Tower).	Similar	to	our	energy	targets,	we	aim	to	achieve	

a	3%	emission	intensity	reduction	over	the	course	of	

next	8	years	with	2019	as	the	base	year.	Going	forward,	

SML plans to introduce more initiatives to support the 

achievement of these targets.

Non GHG Emissions

The	air-conditioning	systems	installed	in	all	of	our	new	

buildings in BSD City use refrigerants that do not produce 

any	Ozone	Depleting	Substances	(ODS).	Hence,	we	are	

pleased to report that none of our buildings produce any 

ODS.

Responsible Waste Management Program 

As	a	real	estate	developer	and	manager,	SML	recognises	

that	waste	management	is	a	critical	issue	that	needs	to	

be addressed to create a sustainable city. We currently 

have	several	initiatives	on	waste	management.	We	

coordinated	with	local	government	to	handle	waste

also	appointed	certified	hazardous	waste	vendors	to

managed by SML.

Effluents and Waste 

Following	the	significant	scope	expansion,	we	placed	all	

our property management projects into the same group 

to	better	manage	and	monitor	the	water	discharge.	

Most	of	BSD	City’s	water	discharge	is	channelled	into	

our	Water	Treatment	Plant	(WTP)	where	it	is	treated	and	

redistributed	back	to	our	customers.	A	very	small	portion	

of	our	effluents	are	discharged	into	the	surrounding	

Cisadene	River,	which	was	found	to	not	be	significantly	

affected	by	the	discharge.	We	target	to	comply	with	all	

relevant	government	regulations	on	waste	and	water	

discharged.	Please	find	following	statistics	on	water	

discharge by destination from our buildings in scope. 

While	2019’s	scope	expanded,	we	are	aware	that	not	

all	building	has	installed	on-site	meter	to	measure	water	

discharge	due	to	their	designs.	Only	the	following	

buildings	have	on-site	meters	to	measure	water

methodology	to	determine	the	water	discharge	volume	

for	the	following	buildings	in	scope:

regret	to	report	that	the	BOD	of	our	effluents	exceeded	

the limit as stipulated by the Indonesian government 

on	13	occasions	in	2019.	Average	BOD	of	effluents	

also	decreased	from	37.4	mg/l	in	2018	to	15.4	mg/l	in	

2019.	The	Indonesian	national	standard	for	effluents	is	a	

maximum	of	30mg/l	BOD.	Our	exceedances	were	minor	

and	did	not	affect	any	local	water	bodies	and	its	related	

habitat.	While	these	minor	exceedances	did	not	result	

in	any	penalisation	or	fines	by	the	government,	we	take	

such	matters	very	seriously.	These	incidents	occurred	

due	to	issues	relating	to	grease	trap	and	STP	vendor	

performance	in	two	of	our	buildings,	namely	QBig	Mall

We	practice	waste	segregation	in	our	developments	and	

pay	special	attention	in	ensuring	that	no	hazardous	waste	

is	sent	to	landfill.	

Apart from increasing the types and amounts of material 

that	can	be	reused	and	recycled	across	our	operations,	

we	are	using	our	ongoing	communications	with	local	

government authorities to suggest improvements to 

the	available	infrastructure	for	the	processing	of	non-

hazardous	waste,	which	is	currently	collected,	managed,	

and	sent	to	landfill.	

The	nine	tonnes	of	hazardous	waste	materials	reported	in	

our	Sustainability	Report	for	financial	year	2017	has	been	

collected	and	managed	by	a	certified	waste	management	

vendor.	In	2018,	we	stored	300kg	of	hazardous	waste	

which	includes	old	light	bulbs	and	used	batteries	in	a	

safe	on-site	facility,	while	we	finalise	the	engagement	of	a	

certified	third-party	to	collect	these	materials.	In	2019,	we	

have improved our data collection measures to improve 

our	hazardous	waste	management.	Our	properties	

generated	16.457	tonnes	of	hazardous	waste.	The	

significant	increase	in	hazardous	waste	was	due	to	three	

factors.	Firstly,	we	have	improved	our	data	collection	

mechanism	for	hazardous	waste	after	appointing	a	

certified	vendor	that	provided	more	comprehensive	data.	

Next,	the	amount	of	waste	generated	increased	as	the	

number of tenants in our green buildings increased. 

Finally,	the	scope	expansion	of	this	year’s	report	to	

include	data	from	all	ITCs,	malls	and	hotels	in	Jakarta	

also contributed to the overall increase in hazardous 

waste.	All	our	offices	in	green	and	non-green	buildings	

except	Sinarmas	Land	MSIG	Tower,	our	retail	malls	

QBig	Mall,	and	The	Breeze,	and	all	of	our	trade	centres	

that	generated	hazardous	waste	contracted	a	certified	

waste	management	vendor	to	collect	and	manage	the	

waste.	On	the	other	hand,	Sinarmas	MSIG	Tower	and	Le	

Grandeur	Mangga	Dua	hotel	stored	515kg	and	1,631kg	

of	hazardous	waste	respectively	in	safe	on-site	facilities.	

Both	buildings	are	in	the	process	of	appointing	certified	

vendors	to	collect	and	manage	their	hazardous	waste.

Highlight: Less Plastic Initiatives

As	part	of	our	SML’s	environmental	initiatives	to	

mitigate	the	impact	of	climate	change,	BSDE	

has encouraged its employees to reduce the 

usage	of	single-use	plastic.	According	to	a	study	

by	the	University	of	Georgia,	Indonesia	is	the	

world’s	second-largest	ocean	plastic	polluter,	

after	China,	with	an	estimate	of	3.2	million	metric	

tonnes	of	plastic	per	annum	entering	water	ways	

and eventually into the ocean9.	Based	on	2018	

data,	SML	has	consumed	11,628	cartons	of	400	

millilitres	(ml)	plastic	bottled	mineral	water	per	

year,	or	an	equivalent	of	279,072	bottles.	As	a	

socially responsible entity that actively protects 

the environment and the local communities 

where	we	operate,	we	introduced	the	#lessplastic	

initiative	in	the	beginning	of	2019.	This	initiative	

was	intended	to	reduce	the	usage	of	single-

use	plastic,	with	the	first	directive	targeting	the	

reduction	of	bottled	mineral	water.	SML	replaced	

bottled	water	with	water	gallon	and	encouraged	

employees	to	bring	their	own	tumbler.	Water	

dispensers	were	placed	in	meeting	rooms	and	

pantries	to	provide	easy	access	within	the	office	

premises.	As	part	of	changing	habits,	SML	shared	

educational information and encouragement to 

reduce	water	consumption	from	single-use	plastic	

bottles	through	its	weekly	email	blast.

Since	the	implementation	of	the	initiative,	SML	

have succeeded in halving the usage of bottled 

mineral	water	to	5,446	cartons	of	400	ml	mineral	

water,	or	an	equivalent	of	130,704	bottles.

Sustainable Community

In this section

The	following	pages	provide	an	overview	of	the	broad	

range	of	initiatives	undertaken	by	Sinarmas	Land	

to	create	a	sustainable	community	in	2019.	SML	is	

committed	to	integrate	our	responsibilities	with	the	

surrounding	communities	as	part	of	our	Group’s	business	

strategy.	By	improving	the	socio-cultural	environment	

within	our	operations’	communities	through	various	

initiatives,	we	aim	to	create	significant	benefits	for	local	

communities based on common shared value and 

coherent understanding. 

Our main initiatives revolved around community 

development	where	we	have	built	essential	infrastructures	

such as upgrading public transportation system and 

infrastructures.	We	have	also	expanded	social	and	

essential	services	such	as	healthcare	and	water	provision	

to	ensure	our	communities’	livelihood	are	protected	and	

sustained.	Economically,	we	implemented	initiatives	

to	improve	the	life	skills	our	communities	through	

various	programs	and	lessons	as	well	as	built	new	

infrastructure	to	improve	their	economic	wellbeing	(i.e.	

Modern	Market	Intermoda).	Environmentally,	we	actively	

involved our communities in programs and initiatives to 

protect	their	surroundings	and	the	environment,	instilling	

environmental consciousness in the process.

Apart	from	large-scale	infrastructure	projects	such	

as	those	outlined	above,	we	have	also	conducted	

need-based	community	programs	such	as	collecting	

donations,	making	contributions	to	the	victims	of	natural	

disasters,	promoting	healthy	living,	and	supporting	the	

development	of	worship	facilities.

SML,	through	BSDE	and	its	BSD	City	flagship	

development,	has	developed	an	entire	township	

equipped	with	complete	facilities	and	amenities	such	as	

residential	units,	business	districts,	commercial	office	

buildings,	shopping	centres,	and	public	facilities	–	all	

of	which	elevate	the	living	standards	of	the	surrounding	

communities.	Through	the	development	of	BSD	City,	SML	

has	created	jobs	and	work	opportunities	for	surrounding	

communities	in	Tangerang,	increasing	the	liveability	and	

income per capita for the region.

As one of the largest privately developed satellite cities 

located	at	the	fringe	of	Central	Jakarta,	BSD	City	has	

become one of the most desirable locations to reside. 

Positioned as an urban oasis surrounded by lush 

Our sustained commercial success depends on the well-being of our 

local communities in Indonesia and our areas of operation. We work 

hard to improve the prosperity of our local stakeholders with targeted, 

strategic investments into infrastructure and community development.

greenery	and	complete	amenities,	our	city-dwellers	are	

conveniently	connected	to	Jakarta	via	key	pieces	of	

public transport infrastructure.

As	a	socially	aware	and	responsible	organisation,	we	

will	continue	our	contribution	to	community	development	

based	on	the	identified	issues	and	needs	of	each	

community.

Engagement Program for All Stakeholders

Sinarmas Land recognises the importance of 

stakeholders	in	driving	our	business	forward.	We	

continuously	seek	to	build	and	improve	relationships	

with	stakeholders	by	involving	them	in	the	right	capacity	

when	carrying	out	business	planning	and	activities.	For	

example,	we	actively	engage	our	communities	to	obtain	

their	feedback	on	their	new	living	spaces	in	BSD	City.	We	

also	listen	to	customers’	opinions	to	develop	products	

and	deliver	services	of	the	highest	quality	to	benefit	our	

stakeholders.	Next,	our	primary	engagement	with	our	

employees	is	at	Employee	Events	held	several	times	

throughout the year. We invite all employees to rate their 

satisfaction	level	in	our	annual	Employee	Satisfaction	

Survey.

Examples	of	current	stakeholder	engagement	exercises	

that are related to our sustainability related topics are: 

• Annual	Customer	Tenant	Satisfaction	Survey;

• Obtaining	feedback	from	customer	and	tenant	on	

sustainability topics through questionnaire;

• Focus	Group	Discussion	(FGD)	to	assess	SML’s	

material	topics	with	selected	stakeholders;

• Green Habit Campaign involving tenants and 

residents;

• Media engagement initiatives 

Managing Our Impact on Communities

As	we	continue	to	develop	and	enhance	the	vibrancy	

of	BSD	City,	certain	development	activities	might	

inevitably pose some inconvenience to communities in 

the	immediate	or	surrounding	vicinity.	Nonetheless,	the	

Group shall respect the rights of local communities and 

ensure that both our contractors and employees adhere 

to the legal requirements stipulated by the Indonesian 

government. 


65

Sinarmas Land Limited

Sustainability Report 2019

Every	contractor	appointed	or	engaged	by	Sinarmas	

Land must be rated by the regional regulator and 

possess a Construction Service Permit Letter issued 

by	the	government.	This	is	part	of	our	internal	control	

procedures to ensure that there is no compromise on the 

quality of our developments.

In	addition,	we	have	included	the	following	initiatives	to	

avoid negative impacts during construction activities:

• Regular	communication	with	the	communities	

surrounding the development project about our 

construction plans; 

• Respect	the	needs	and	well-being	of	surrounding	

communities	(e.g.	noise	reduction,	reasonable	

construction	hours,	keeping	the	environment	clean	

during construction);

Apart	from	the	examples	of	our	work	undertaken	for	

the	benefit	of	local	communities	cited	above,	we	are	

pleased	to	share	that	during	the	reporting	period,	none	

of	our	operations	were	found	to	have	any	significant	or	

potentially negative impacts on local communities. Based 

on	Government	Regulation	No.	27	(2012)	on	Environment	

Control	Permits,	before	commencement	of	any	property	

development	project	in	Indonesia,	every	developer	must	

perform an environmental impact assessment (AMDAL) 

and provide plans to avoid/mitigate the possibility of 

negative	impacts,	if	any.	The	content	of	this	assessment	

is	extensive	and	includes	physical,	chemical	(land,	soil,	

space,	etc.),	as	well	as	biological	aspects	(habitats	

and	biodiversity),	social	factors	(economics,	safety,	

culture,	etc.)	and	community	health.	These	regulatory	

stipulated assessments ensure that developers give due 

consideration to the potential environmental impacts 

before	embarking	on	their	development.	The	developer	

is	only	allowed	to	commence	the	development	once	

they have obtained the approved environmental impact 

assessment,	amongst	many	other	mandatory	required	

approvals,	from	the	local	government.

Engagement with Media

Media is an important platform for SML to communicate 

with	the	society	and	other	public	entities.	Through	our	

Corporate	Communication	Division,	SML	is	actively	

engaged	with	the	media	and	communities	to	provide	

the	latest	information	on	SML	products,	services	and	

businesses.	In	2019,	SML	undertook	the	following	

engagements	with	the	media:

• Exclusive interview: SML	provided	exclusive	

interview	to	a	few	selected	media	partners.	These	

privileged	partners	will	be	able	to	receive	first-hand	

information	of	our	product	or	services,	as	well	as	

having	priority	rights	to	get	an	interview	with	our	

representatives. 

• Press release: SML Corporate Communication 

Division	uses	press	release	to	broadcast	information,	

official	statement,	announcement	of	new	products	or	

services,	to	the	members	of	the	public	and	media.			

• Press conference: SML organised a press 

conference to announce important events or 

collaboration	with	joint	venture	partners,	as	well	as	

significant	ceremonial	occasions.	During	the	press	

conference,	media	reporters	from	newspapers,	TV,	

radio and online media platforms are invited to cover 

the	event	and	attend	the	post-event	Q&amp;A	session.		

• Press tour: SML has a dedicated press tour for 

photographers from various media partners to visit 

and	take	pictures	of	our	developments	and	product	

offerings.

• Media gathering: On	a	regular	basis,	SML	Corporate	

Communication Division organise media gathering 

as part of its engagement initiative to maintain a 

good	relationship	with	our	media	partners.	This	

event	serves	as	a	two-way	communication	between	

our Corporate Communication team and our media 

partners	to	share	their	concerns,	public	opinion	on	the	

Group,	as	well	as	areas	for	improvement.		

Improving Community Welfare in 

Surrounding Development Area

Sinarmas	Land’s	sustained	commercial	success	depends	

on	the	well-being	of	local	communities	in	our	areas	of	

operation. We strive to improve the prosperity of local 

stakeholders	with	targeted	and	strategic	investments	into	

local infrastructure and community development.

In	2019,	we	undertook	several	initiatives	that	aims	

to	provide	work	opportunities,	enhance	skills	and	

knowledge	for	potential	talent	in	communities.	These	

initiatives provided a platform for local talents to connect 

with	potential	employers	and	assess	opportunities.	Some	

of	our	main	initiatives	are	as	follows:

•	 Development	of	modern	market	in	BSD	City	for	local	

entrepreneurs;

•	 Improved	Tangsel	women	community’s	welfare	with	

BSD	Knowledge	House	craft	centre;

• Provided computer programming and coding 

scholarships	for	students	who	live	around	BSD	city	

and	linking	them	to	potential	employers;

• Conducted a series of training programs partnering 

Pasar Rakyat	School	at	BSD	City	for	Micro,	Small	&amp;	

Medium	Enterprises	(“MSMEs”)	to	enhance	their	skills.	

Not	only	does	these	training	program	benefit	MSMEs,	

managers are also able to enhance their management 

skills	in	maintaining	a	clean	and	healthy	marketplace.

In	addition,	SML	has	also	contributed	to	various	local	

community	initiatives	in	2019	through	the	following	

actions:

Educational Patronage

In this section

The	following	pages	provide	an	overview	of	Sinarmas	

Land’s	investment	in	education.	We	place	a	strong	

emphasis	on	education,	and	take	a	long-term	approach	

to this. A strong education system not only helps our 

local	society,	but	in	the	longer-term	breeds	talent	that	are	

essential	for	the	long-term	success	of	our	business.	More	

importantly,	an	educated	and	self-sufficient	population	

can drive developments in Indonesia and our areas of 

operation.	Ultimately,	a	prosperous	and	skilled	population	

can	help	to	alleviate	many	social	issues,	as	well	as	

improving	local	communities’	living	standards.

We aim to be a leader in contributing to the education 

system	and	infrastructure	within	our	organisation,	as	well	

as communities in Indonesia and our areas of operations. 

Internally,	we	implemented	various	initiatives	to	improve	

knowledge	and	skillsets	of	our	employees.	We	have	also	

set targets and policies to maintain the quality of our 

human resources and talents.

Externally,	we	strive	to	provide	equal	opportunity	to	

all members of local communities to gain essential 

knowledge	and	skills	for	them	to	succeed	and	be	self-

sufficient.	We	conducted	education	related	initiatives	

and activities to encourage learning and personal 

developments.	In	addition,	we	invested	in	infrastructure	

and	resources	to	enhance	the	learning	processes,	as	

well	as	the	renovation	of	school	buildings	and	extended	

financial	assistance	towards	the	purchase	of	learning	

equipment.

Initiating Program to Support Knowledge 

Enhancement 

Human	resource	is	one	of	Indonesia’s	most	important	

assets. Sinarmas Land considers education to be one 

of	the	most	important	pre-requisites	for	the	sustainable	

development of society and our employees. We believe 

that	by	enhancing	knowledge	of	the	Group’s	employees	

and	communities,	we	can	lay	a	promising	future	for	

SML’s	sustainability.	Therefore,	it	is	imperative	for	SML	to	

explore	ways	to	upskill	our	people	and	to	build	the	best	

talent pool in our communities. We developed several 

programs to support these targets:

Our continuous growth and success rests on the knowledge and 

skillsets of our current human resources, as well as future talents 

from local communities. We invest strategically in education 

infrastructure and initiatives to upskill our talents to safeguard the 

future of Indonesia and our workforce.

community in BSD City;

• Scholarship	program	for	employee’s	children	and	

family; and 

• Scholarship	program	for	community	in	Tangerang	

district	and	South	Tangerang	City.

Training and development

Internally,	we	conducted	the	annual	employee	training	

and	professional	certification.	We	also	allocated	

an	annual	training	budget	and	developed	in-house	

programs	to	support	the	career	growth	and	aspirations	of	

our employees. We believe that equipping our employees 

with	the	skills	they	require	for	personal	and	professional	

growth	would	be	beneficial	to	the	future	growth	of	our	

Group.	Furthermore,	developing	skills	and	nurturing	

talents	allows	employees	to	grow,	leading	to	better	

opportunities,	thereby	helping	the	communities	where	

they	live	and	work	to	flourish.	We	also	provide	on-the-job	

training	opportunities	and	support	sufficiently	qualified	

staff	by	paying	for	their	relevant	professional	bodies’	

membership	fees,	such	as	chartered	engineers.

Case Study - Gerakan Sekolah 

Menyenangkan (Fun School Movement)



 



 



Gerakan Sekolah Menyenangkan (GSM) is a social 

movement	formed	together	with	teachers	to	create	

a	critical,	creative,	collaborative	and	fun	learning	

environment	and	culture	in	public	schools.	This	initiative	

aims	to	help	educators	(school	supervisors,	principal,	

and	teachers)	in	Tangerang	District	and	South	Tangerang	

City	to	improve	their	soft	skills,	as	well	as	to	transform	

schools	into	fun	places	to	learn,	gaining	essential	

knowledge	and	life	skills	to	nurture	successful	leaders	

and	learners	of	tomorrow.	In	conclusion,	GSM	is	focused	

on	developing	human	resource	which	may	foster	trust	

between	the	society	and	SML.

The	GSM	movement	was	founded	by	a	Yogyakarta	based	

married	couple	in	2013	and	SML	subsequently	adopted	

this	initiative	in	2017.	Since	then,	the	program	has	

benefitted	more	than	1,000	educators	from	293	schools	

in	Tangerang	District	and	South	Tangerang	City.

There	are	three	main	activities	in	GSM’s	implementation:

1. GSM Workshop:

GSM	workshop	is	conducted	by	GSM’s	founder	with	the	

aims	to	introduce	and	familiarise	educators	with	GSM’s	

methods to implement the program in their respective 

schools.	GSM	facilitators	who	are	tasked	to	disseminate	

and socialise information about GSM to schools 

throughout	Indonesia	are	then	identified,	assessed	and	

selected by SML.

Sinarmas Land Limited

Sustainability Report 2019

As	aforementioned,	GSM	benefits	four	main	stakeholder	

groups:

• Society and Sinarmas Land: GSM creates social 

impact	in	the	society,	especially	in	SML’s	operation	

and	development	areas.	This	program	is	one	of	the	

Group’s	primary	business	strategies	to	foster	and	

maintain	good	relationships	with	communities	and	

other	entities	such	as	civil	society,	government,	

academics,	and	other	entrepreneurs.

• Public Schools/Madrasa:	GSM	workshops	provide	

positive	activities	that	will	benefit	deprived	public	

schools and Madrasas by improving their reputation 

and	confidence	to	compete	with	more	reputable	

schools.	Schools	located	in	remote	areas,	villages	

and	suburbs	will	now	have	better	environment,	

resources,	and	learning	methods.

• Educators (School Supervisors, Principal, and 

Teachers):	Training	and	workshops	for	educators	

may	raise	their	ability	and	knowledge	to	provide	or	

carry out more effective teaching methods. After 

attending	GSM,	educators	in	BSD	City	area	will	

become more effective and independent.

• Students: Students	can	experience	the	change	

in the education system generated through GSM 

implementations.	Now,	children	from	poor	and	

disadvantaged	families,	who	previously	attended	

underfunded	schools,	have	the	opportunity	to	receive	

a	better	quality	of	education.	Also,	teaching	methods	

from	this	program	will	make	learning	more	exciting	

hence helping students to better understand and 

remain committed at their respective schools or 

madrasas.

Key Challenges and Solutions: 

Some challenges and issues that arose during the GSM 

implementation	are	as	follow:

i.	 Unwillingness/resistance	from	educators	(GSM	main	

target	audience)	to	change.	They	are	accustomed	

to	traditional	teaching	paradigms	whilst	GSM’s	initial	

stages require educators to changes their mindsets in 

order to embrace changes in the education methods; 

and

ii. Limited resources and time to aid schools or 

madrasas in the implementation of GSM.

We have proposed several solutions to address the 

above challenges:

i.	 Maintain	good	relationships	with	Education	Authorities	

(organiser of public schools) and Ministry of Religion 

Office	(organiser	of	madrasa	education)	to	socialise	

GSM,	and	persuade	them	that	GSM	implementation	

can	be	the	solution	for	existing	educational	problems.	

SML	hopes	that	building	trust	between	the	educators	

Educational Patronage

and	the	Group	will	encourage	educators	to	be	more	

receptive in the implementation of GSM in their 

respective learning processes.

ii.	 Cooperate	with	university	students	who	were	on	

internship	program	in	Sinarmas	Land.	They	will	join	

the GSM assistance team to assist in the monitoring 

and observation of activities in school or madrasas. 

Direct monitoring and observation are performed 

throughout	the	year	(3	visits	per	year),	while	active	

monitoring through Whatsapp communication group 

is performed daily.

Opportunities for the Future of GSM:

GSM initiatives can potentially be implemented in other 

SML’s	project	locations	since	we	have	garner	significant	

amount	of	positive	reviews	from	educators	and	students.	

With	support	and	commitment	from	SML’s	leaders,	GSM	

can	be	expanded	into	every	SML	project	development.

To	achieve	the	goals	set	out	for	this	initiative,	a	formal	

organisational	structure	to	manage	GSM	will	be	

established.	This	organisation	structure	will	consist	of	an	

Activity	Coordinator,	Reporting	Coordinator,	Observer,	

Transportation	Coordinator,	and	a	Communication	

Manager.

SML	will	also	engage	with	local	government	and	GSM’s	

founder	to	strengthen	GSM’s	legality	through	formal	

agreements	-	Memorandum	of	Understanding	(MOU)	

or other types of agreement. SML has also encouraged 

local government to create regional government bodies 

to	regulate	and	monitor	GSM’s	implementation.

Performance Data

Environment

1.	 Buildings’	environmental	performance	data	include	

data	of	the	whole	building	(common	area	and	

tenants’	data	are	included	in	scope),	except	for	the	

Commercial	buildings	where	we	maintain	control	of	

the	common	area	only.	Data	from	tenants	is	excluded	

from all Commercial buildings.

2.	 Buildings’	energy	consumption,	GHG	emissions,	

and respective intensities data include our use 

of electricity from the grid and diesel fuel for 

emergency	purposes	in	our	back-up	generators.	Our	

processes	do	not	use	any	heating,	cooling,	or	steam	

consumption.

3.	 Due	to	a	massive	blackout	of	several	hours	in	August	

2019	in	Java	Regions,	a	majority	of	affected	buildings	

used	diesel-generators	for	electricity.	Hence,	

there	were	significant	diesel	consumption	in	some	

buildings’	Q3	data.

4.	 We	do	not	sell	any	electricity,	heating,	cooling,	or	

steam energy to other organisations.

5.	 Gross	Floor	Area	(GFA)	for	intensity	figures:	GFA	is	

identified	based	on	the	Built	Drawing	Data	and	Tenant	

Relation	Data	(based	on	Tenant	Agreement).

6.	 All	covered	floor	areas	of	a	building,	except	otherwise	

exempted,	and	uncovered	areas	for	commercial	uses,	

are	deemed	to	be	the	gross	floor	area	of	the	building.

7.	 We	also	report	our	intensity	figures	on	a	GFA	

occupied basis. GFA occupied is calculated by 

multiplying occupancy rate (simple average of 

monthly	occupancy	rates)	with	the	GFA.

8. Building and development site details including 

property	type,	approximate	net	leasable	area,	project	

site	area,	and	expected	completion	date	are	available	

in	SML’s	Annual	Report	2019	(Property	Portfolio,	page	

78-87).

9.	 Green	Buildings’	occupancy	rate	in	2018	was	

revised	from	91.50%	to	70.13%	due	to	a	correction	to	

MyRepublic	Plaza’s	GFA	Occupied.	As	a	result,	GFA	

Occupied	in	2018	is	also	revised	from	72,121	m2 to 

55,278.10	m2 in this report.

10.	ITC	BSD’s	GFA	in	2018	was	revised	from	40,884	m2 to 

100,788	m2.	As	a	result,	GFA	Occupied	in	2018	was	

also	revised	from	39,277.89	m2	to	96,828.60	m2.

11. Standards and methodologies used for unit 

conversion of diesel fuel are based on the Carbon 

Disclosure Project.

12. Greenhouse gas conversion is based on the 

Greenhouse Gas Protocol. 

13.	Emission	factors	for	electricity	consumption	are	

sourced	from	the	Standard	Pedoman	Teknis	

Perhitungan	Baseline	Gas	Rumah	Kaca	Sektor	

Berbasis	Energi	Republik	Indonesia,	Area	Jamali	

(Jawa-Madura	Bali):	0.725	kg/CO2/kWh.	

14.	Greenhouse	Gas	Protocol	Emission	Factors	from	

Cross	Sector	Tools,	March	2017	were	used	for	diesel	

conversions.	The	gases	included	in	the	conversion	of	

diesel are CO2,	CH4	and	N2O. 

15.	Our	water	consumption	data	is	based	on	the	

standards	and	methodologies	defined	by	the	

Indonesian	National	Standard	and	Indonesian	

regulation	for	water	supply.

16.	We	have	on-site	meters	to	measure	water	discharge	

in	only	three	of	our	buildings	in	scope,	namely:	

 

•	 Asset	Management	(ITC)	–	ITC	Fatmawati,	Graha	

Cempaka	Mas,	and	Roxy	Mas;

 

•	 Asset	Management	(Office)	–	MyRepublic	Plaza,	

Sinar	Mas	Land	Plaza	-	Jakarta	(Tower	2	&amp;	3),	and	

Wisma BCA;

 

• Retail &amp; Hospitality – QBig Mall.

 

For	buildings	without	on-site	meters,	we	assumed	

that	volume	of	water	discharged	is	based	on	the	

assumption	that	volume	of	water	discharge	from	a	

building	is	approximately	80%	of	water	consumption	

for	each	building.	This	methodology	is	aligned	

with	international	standards	and	the	Indonesian	

government’s	Ministry	of	Public	Work	and	Housing.	

We have applied this methodology to determine the 

water	discharge	volume	for	the	following	buildings	in	

scope: 

 

•	 Asset	Management	(ITC)	–	ITC	BSD,	BSD	

Junction,	Mall	Ambassador,	Mall	Mangga	Dua,	

ITC	Cempaka	Mas,	ITC	Depok,	ITC	Kuningan,	ITC	

Permata	Hijau,	and	ITC	Mangga	Dua;

 

•	 Asset	Management	(Office)	–	Sinar	Mas	Land	

Plaza	-	BSD	City,	GOP	9,	Sinar	Mas	Land	Plaza	-	

Jakarta	(Tower	1),	Dimo	Space,	Sinarmas	MSIG	

Tower,	and	BSD	City	Marketing	Office;

 

•	 Retail	and	Hospitality	–	The	Breeze,	and	Le	

Grandeur Mangga Dua Hotel;

 

•	 Strategic	Land	Bank	–	BSD	Modern	Market.	

 

Data from our residential apartment and business 

Loft	buildings	are	excluded	from	the	scope	of	water	

discharge as these buildings are tenanted (SML only 

maintains control of the common area). Data from the 

buildings	housing	the	Customer	Care	Office	and	the	

BSD	Permit	and	Township	Office	are	also	excluded	

from	this	report’s	scope	as	these	buildings	are	using	

septic	tanks,	hence	there	are	no	records	of	water	

discharge.

17.	Development	projects’	environmental	performance	

data includes information on materials used. We 

currently	do	not	report	on	energy	consumption,	

water	consumption,	and	waste	produced	in	our	

development projects.
