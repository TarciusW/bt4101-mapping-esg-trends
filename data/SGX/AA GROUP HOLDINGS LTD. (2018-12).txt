BOARD'S STATEMENT  

The Board of Directors (the “Board” or "Directors") of AA Group Holdings Ltd (the “Company” and 

together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) recognise the importance of sustainability and is pleased 

to publish our sustainability report for the financial year ended 2018 ("Report"), highlighting the 

Group’s environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) initiatives.  

 

The global business environment remains competitive and the Group will continue to face challenges 

along the way. In addition to the Group's organic growth, the Group will continue to explore various 

opportunities to diversify its business portfolio and evaluate potential investments that can 

strengthen and broaden its revenue base and position the Group strategically for further growth.  

 

During the reporting year of 2018, the Group had completed the divestment of its previous businesses 

namely Allied Advantage Sdn Bhd and Toko Construction Pte. Ltd., whose businesses are of 

manufacturing and supply of high precision cold forged loudspeaker parts, building construction and 

manufacture of furniture of rattan and cane respectively. In the same year, the Group had successfully 

acquired Poh Huat Heng Corporation Pte. Ltd. (“PHH”) on 17 December 2018. PHH is in the business 

of providing underground cable installation and road reinstatement services. 

 

The Group is committed to upholding good corporate governance practices, enhancing operational 

safety and promoting environmental sustainability. We have and will consider these sustainability 

issues as part of our strategic formulation for the Group, and will continue to oversee the management 

and monitoring of our ESG performance and initiatives. We want to thank our stakeholders for their 

continued support and we look forward to sharing our sustainability performance in the forthcoming 

years.

ABOUT THE REPORT 

This Report is prepared with reference to Rule 711B of Section B: Rules of Catalist of the Listing Manual 

of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“Catalist Rules”), the Sustainability Reporting 

Guide of the SGX-ST, and in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core 

option. The Group has chosen the GRI Standards as it is internationally recognised and represents the 

global best practice for reporting. The GRI Content Index presented at the end of this Report indicates 

the extent of the application of the GRI Standards.  

 

As this is only the Group's second year of reporting, we did not seek external assurance for this Report. 

We have relied on internal assurance as to the accuracy of the ESG performance data, which are 

reported in good faith and are accurate to the best of our knowledge. 

 

This Report covers our ESG performance and initiatives for the Group's operations in Singapore and 

Malaysia for the period from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018. The Group’s operations in Malaysia 

began only in FY2018, when W&amp;P Precast Pte. Ltd. shifted part of its operations from Singapore to 

Malaysia under its subsidiary, W&amp;P Precast Sdn. Bhd. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Through this Report, the Company hopes to share its sustainability progress and we welcome 

stakeholders to submit their feedback to us at our office address as stated on the last page of this 

Report or through the Company’s website. As part of our environmental conservation efforts, no hard

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

We undertook our first materiality assessment in 2017 to identify and prioritise relevant sustainability 

topics. Facilitated by an independent sustainability consultant, this assessment involves the 

management, key representatives from the Company’s various business units as well as internal and 

external stakeholders. Material topics have been identified based on both risks and opportunities 

arising from our business activities, the environmental, social and governance impacts that are most 

significant to our stakeholders, as well as with reference to our current risk management framework.  

 

This year, we reviewed and revalidated the existing material ESG topics, and determined that they 

remain relevant in 2018. In addition to these existing material topics, three more material topics were 

identified for 2018 - Workforce Diversity, Customer Satisfaction and Whistleblowing. 

The matrix below depicts the material topics that are of importance to our stakeholders in 2018:

The materiality assessment took into account the GRI guidelines, and the material topics that are 

significant to the Group's operations in Singapore and Malaysia are presented below. We have 

gathered feedback from various stakeholders across our entire value chain who are influenced by, and 

can significantly influence, the Group’s businesses and operations. By identifying material topics that 

have both positive and negative impact on stakeholders, we ensure that both risks and opportunities 

are taken into account in our strategic and business planning. 

For each material topic, we report on its relevance to our business and stakeholders. 

 

The following sections in this Report evaluate these material topics taking into consideration the 

changing business landscape and our business direction. We will strengthen our existing sustainability 

framework, set targets for improvement and aim to reach these targets in the subsequent years. 

We look forward to further engage with our stakeholders. The perspectives of our stakeholders will 

help us evaluate and fine-tune our approach to better manage our business in a sustainable way.

GOVERNANCE  

We believe that having the right business values – good corporate governance and ethical conduct is 

crucial to the Group's growth and provides a robust foundation to the Group. The Group is committed 

to conduct our business in an ethical and responsible manner, and we do not tolerate any corruption 

or bribery within any of our businesses. 

 

Corporate Governance 

The Group understands the importance of good corporate governance, accountability and 

transparency and is committed to uphold high standards of governance and regulatory compliance. In 

FY2018, the Group ensured compliance with the Code of Corporate Governance 2012 as required 

under the Catalist Rules. The Group notes that the revised Code of Corporate Governance issued on 6 

August 2018 (the "Revised Code") is effective for the financial year commencing 1 January 2019, and 

will endeavour to comply with the Revised Code in FY2019. 

 

Please refer to pages 13 to 46 of our Annual Report 2018 for further details of our Corporate 

Governance practices and compliance with the Code of Corporate Governance 2012.  

 

The Group has a dynamic team in place to implement and execute sustainable strategies across the 

organisation. The Sustainability Committee ensures all strategies, policies and practices have been 

incorporated to strengthen its sustainability performance and reports to the Board on all sustainability 

matters.  

 

The Board oversees the Sustainability Committee and ensures that all material factors identified are 

well-managed and monitored to ensure transparency and accountability towards the Group.

Compliance 

The Group conducts its businesses in an honest and ethical manner and is committed to act 

professionally and fairly in all business dealings. 

 

The Board meets on a regular basis to ensure that the Group meets all regulatory requirements and 

ensures compliance with all relevant laws and regulations in countries we operate in. Similarly, the 

Board will also manage the Sustainability Committee to ensure that the Group is in compliant with the 

relevant rules and regulations and adheres to the policies and procedures that has been set out by the 

management and the Board. 

 We have been actively engaging our continuing sponsor and we remain compliant with all reporting 

requirements under the Catalist Rules as well as other applicable rules and regulations in Singapore. 

There were no non-compliance cases recorded during the reporting year of 2018. Since there was no 

record of non-compliance, the Board believes that the Group's compliance controls remain 

appropriate and we strive to work closely with our continuing sponsor to maintain zero incident of 

non-compliance record in the subsequent years. 

 

Whistleblowing 

The Group has had a robust whistle-blowing policy in place since 2008 and it has been updated from 

time to time in order to stay relevant, with the latest review in FY2018. The updated policies and 

procedures for raising any concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or 

management were communicated to all employees of the Group via email on 1 January 2019. This will 

also be communicated to all new employees of the Group during the orientation for new employees. 

 

The policy applies to all employees within the Group and any third parties dealing with the Group, and 

provides a mechanism for employees and external parties to report concerns over alleged wrongful 

acts. Employees or external parties with complaints, concerns or issues relating to potential corrupt 

activities, are able to raise their concerns, in confidence, to the Lead Independent Director Mr. Lee 

Chong Yang, or the Chairman of the Audit Committee, Ms. Amelia Vincent. This is also addressed on 

page 37 of our Annual Report 2018.  

 

During the reporting year of 2018, we had no reported instances of corrupt activities across our 

businesses and operating subsidiaries. Likewise, we seek to maintain our good track record of zero 

corruption incidents in the upcoming years.

SOCIAL 

Employment Practices 

We practice fair employment and provide equal opportunities to all employees, regardless of their 

race, religion, age, gender or background. We believe that promoting a fair workplace environment 

will build the employees’ respect and loyalty towards the company.  

 

We are fully compliant with the Singapore Government’s Employment Practices listed under the 

Ministry of Manpower to ensure that we remain competitive against similar industry players. There 

have been zero cases of discriminations for FY2018 and we aim to maintain that record.   

 

The Human Resource Policies and Procedures (“HRPP”) formulated by the Human Resource team have 

been updated from time to time and applied across all business units to ensure consistency of internal 

practices among all business units. The HRPP documents the employee's benefits and governs our 

non-discriminatory hiring policies and merit-based promotion policies. Fair and non-discriminatory 

employment policies are put in place to attract and retain talent. 

 

➢ Valuing our employees 

The Group prioritises job satisfaction and welfare as one of its top priorities. We recognise long-serving 

employees with cash awards and the contributions made by our employees with various incentives to 

show our appreciation. Our employees are entitled to a range of benefits including healthcare, 

insurance and parental leave. Further, the Group offers competitive pay packages that are 

benchmarked to the market and rewards each employee based on their competency and 

performance. Our employees are motivated and satisfied and this results in high employee retention 

rates, as per the chart below:

As part of our continued efforts toward providing transparent and merit-based compensation 

package, the remuneration breakdown of our directors and our key management personnel can be 

found on page 31 of our Annual Report 2018.  

 

In the upcoming years, we target to increase team-bonding activities to foster greater workplace 

cohesion and trust between employees. We will also look into the ratio of basic salary and 

remuneration of women to men by employee category, to ensure that they are fair and non-

discriminatory.  

 

Workforce Diversity  

The Group believes in the importance of diversity that it drives innovation and increases competitive 

advantage in our organization. Our employees come from all walks of life. All qualified candidates will 

be considered without discrimination of gender, nationality, age and religion in our recruitment 

process.  

 

We ensure that our employees have access to a fair, collaborative and engaging workplace which 

allows them to provide their perspectives and concerns on the issues. To ensure that our staff stay 

abreast of the updated skills or information, we provide regular training opportunities for staff to 

equip themselves with the required skill sets. In the upcoming years, we target to increase the 

frequency in which our workers attend courses and trainings, in particular for courses and trainings in 

relation to safety work practices. 

 

In FY2018, employees attended courses and trainings amounting to 859.5 training hours. The training 

covers the necessary technical and soft skill sets, as well as on-the-job training.

In FY2018, our workforce consisted of 126 employees, including 119 male employees and 7 female 

employees, as shown in the charts below. The increase in the number of total employees was due to 

the addition of employees hired under PHH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group. Our workforce 

has a higher number of male employees due to the nature of our business operations.

As at 31 December 2018, we have 6 directors on the Board; 5 male directors and 1 female director 

and they are individuals who have diverse qualifications and work experience. For more details on the 

qualification and work experience of each Director, please refer to Board of Directors on pages 8 and 

9 of our Annual Report 2018.  

 

In the same year, there were a total of 11 new male hires and 30 male job leavers across all business 

units, as shown in the chart below. Our turnover rate for the year averages at 23.8% largely due to the 

high turnover of foreign workers. To address this issue, employees are encouraged to provide 

feedback to their reporting manager. There are also cohesive activities (such as team lunch, special 

occasion celebrations) in place for team bonding.  

 

 

Customer Satisfaction 

Our businesses thrive on mutually beneficial and strong relationships formed with our customers. We 

always emphasize the importance of providing good customer service to all our employees. Feedback 

from customers are reviewed and relevant follow-up actions are performed in a timely manner. Good 

relationships with our customers and positive feedback from our customers motivate us as a Group 

to continue delivering a high standard of service quality and work across all our operations. 

For the year under review, the Group did not receive any official complaints from their customers, and 

aim to maintain our good track record of zero customer complaints in the upcoming years.

Occupational Health and Safety 

The well-being and safety of our employees and relevant stakeholders are of utmost importance to 

us. To ensure a safe working environment, our employees and relevant stakeholders are expected to 

observe and follow safety procedures at all times.  

Safety briefing by the project lead will be held before the commencement of each project. All safe 

work practices manual will be reviewed regularly by the top management, taking into account the 

feedback we received from the ground staff, to ensure effectiveness in work processes. 

For the year under review, there were two incidents relating to a worksite injury and a minor fire. 

However, these events did not result in any work-related fatalities.

There were no injuries reported from the fire, 

and the property is covered by insurance. 

 

With respect to the minor fire incident, an official fire report was received from the Singapore Civil 

Defence Force (SCDF), stating the cause of fire as accidental by electrical origin at the wirings. The 

management including the supervisors and plant managers, will be expected to carry out routine 

exercises and checks to prevent further occurrence of such incident in future. EMS will continue to 

work with its appointed Fire Safety Manager, who takes charge of fire safety activities and fire 

prevention measures to promote fire safety awareness. The Fire Safety Manager conducts ad-hoc 

inspections once a month to ensure that fire safety procedures are put in place in compliance with the 

recommendations provided by the SCDF and the Building and Construction Authority (BCA).  

The Group has since implemented measures as described below and we strive to achieve zero incident 

record in the subsequent years.

stakeholders are also reminded of the importance to save water in their daily activities and to reduce 

water usage.   

 

We monitor energy usage at the construction sites for all our projects to ensure that they are 

maintained at consistent levels, and any abnormality is immediately investigated and rectified. In 

addition to reducing energy consumption in relation to construction activities, we also implement 

various measures to minimize energy consumption in our head office building. Employees and

relevant stakeholders are reminded regularly to switch off all lights, aircon and equipment when they 

leave the office or when equipment is not in use. Air conditioners within the head office buildings are 

serviced regularly, and rundown Fan Coil Units (FCUs) are replaced to maintain high efficiency.  

 

As part of our initiatives, energy saving LED lights were installed around our premises. Subsequently, 

we are looking to progressively install energy saving LED lights for all office units on our premises. We 

may also consider energy efficient equipment when purchasing new office equipment in the future.  

 

Effluents and Waste 

We continuously strive to reduce waste from operations by encouraging employees and relevant 

stakeholders to re-use and recycle usable material. In addition, we have been enforcing stringent 

controls on the management of waste generated from our operations. These controls include proper 

segregation and disposal of waste. Our waste includes general waste, wood waste and food waste. 

There is no hazardous waste produced. Recycling bins and multiple waste segregation bins are 

available within our premises and are placed at common areas for employees and relevant 

stakeholders to segregate waste.  

We also engage environmentally responsible service provider to manage the disposal of our waste. All 

waste generated are collected from the site by a licensed waste collector. General and food waste are 

sent to the National Environment Agency (NEA) for waste-to-energy (WTE) incineration and wood 

waste are sent to our service provider's site for recycling purposes. The Group endeavours to manage 

waste sustainably by utilising technologies in the future. 

In the reporting year of 2018, there were no incidence of non-compliance with laws and regulations 

resulting in significant fines and we strive to maintain this record in the subsequent years. 

 

Supply Chain 

We recognise the importance of sustainable value generation and take into consideration the 

following factors - economic value of products, business ethics and reputation as a few of the criterion 

when assessing and selecting new potential suppliers. We believe that a sustainable supply chain can 

help us conserve resources, optimise processes and increase productivity. 

 

The head of each business unit conducts stringent checks on our current suppliers to ensure they are 

in compliance with local rules and regulations. Similarly, the checks include ethical practices of these

suppliers while sourcing for raw materials and the degree of impact these processes contribute to the 

environment.  

 

We aim to create more long-term business relationships with local suppliers and we make a 

conscientious effort to procure from local suppliers directly.

Product and Service Quality 

We have a stringent quality assurance system and we have conducted random due diligence checks 

to ensure all our products receive proper certification of compliance. We are committed to ensuring 

that our products are manufactured according to industry standards. WPC’s source of materials for 

the supply and manufacturing of ready-mix concrete, precast component and related products are 

from BCA registered suppliers in Singapore.  

 

In the reporting year of 2018, we did not receive any formal complaints about our product or service 

quality, and we endeavour to maintain this clean record in the subsequent years.
