MESSAGE FROM

THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO

Dear Stakeholders, 

Last year, we published our second Sustainability Report in which we described our 

corporate social responsibility initiatives, an aspect that is garnering increased significance 

in long-term value creation. Our desire to be a responsible company - one that promotes 

policies to create ever more value for all our stakeholders - has strengthened even further, 

with a commitment that is expressed, primarily, in the sustainable management of our 

business in the long term. Sustainability is not just an opportunity but for Bund Center 

Investment Ltd and our subsidiaries, it is a genuine mission to represent a model of 

excellence.

B U N D  C E N T E R  I N V E S T M E N T  LT D

“We are gradually 

evolving into an 

organisation whose 

operations are 

sustainable and 

anchored on the 

United Nations 

Sustainable 

Development 

Goals.”

S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9

This year, in our third Sustainability Report, we have refined our 

Sustainability Framework with four pillars on which our strategies, 

targets and programs for sustainability are built. Since Bund Center 

Investment Ltd started monitoring and measuring our performance 

indicators for our material issues, we are gradually evolving into 

an organisation whose operations are sustainable and anchored 

on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Our 

hotel, The Westin Bund Center, Shanghai, has been assessing and 

mitigating environmental risks, while continuing investments to 

minimise negative environmental impacts, including reduction of 

greenhouse gas emissions. I am pleased to announce that through 

a combination of infrastructure improvements and monitoring 

methods, The Westin Bund Center, Shanghai has achieved a 0.98% 

improvement in energy intensity and a 2.6% reduction in water 

intensity by GFA¹ compared to 2018.

We believe that safety is a top priority that cannot be compromised. 

Across all entities within the Group, safety culture is in place that 

conforms to the basics and principles of safety. We are also driven to 

positively contributing to the communities where we live and work 

and will continue our activities for local community development 

and social contribution, in particular, support for youth educational 

programs in the hospitality industry. Lastly, we are bolstering ethics 

and compliance management to nurture a transparent and sound 

corporate culture.

While our improvement efforts are constant and ongoing, the 

Sustainability Report is an opportunity to take stock, assess our 

position and share with all our stakeholders what has been achieved 

so far – as well as define new targets and objectives ahead.

The publication of this Sustainability Report comes at a time 

when the world is facing enormous economic, health, and social 

challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Bund Center 

Investment Ltd is doing everything it can to support its employees 

and reaching out to help frontline healthcare workers and affected 

communities. Notwithstanding the challenges the world and our 

country are facing today, we remain optimistic of the long-term 

prospects as we continue to create value for our stakeholders while 

delivering sustainable growth.

And to all of you, to our customers, to our shareholders, our 

communities, thank you for your support and trust.

OUR BUSINESS

A robust governance and risk management framework guides 

BCI in conducting our business fairly and ethically with a zero-

tolerance approach towards corruption. Compliance to relevant 

laws and regulations as well as standards and policies remains 

the foundation of our business practices. We are committed to 

ensuring that our supply chain continues to practice responsibility 

and accountability in their procurement process.

Governance

We are committed to upholding the highest standards of 

governance in our business operations. To guide us in our 

commitment, we exercise integrity and honesty in all aspects of 

our operations. Compliance to regulatory requirements is the 

primary basis of good governance.

Anti-Corruption (GRI 205-3)

We have established policies to guide us in ensuring that our 

business practices are conducted ethically with a firm stance 

against corruption. We adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards fraud, 

corruption and unethical actions. Our Code of Conduct provides our 

employees direction on the standards of ethical behaviour required 

of them. In addition, our whistle blowing policy ensures all our 

internal or external stakeholders can report any suspected breach 

of conduct, bribery, corruption, fraud or any other misconduct 

through our whistleblowing channels without fear of repercussion.

For the Westin Bund Center, our anti-corruption policy aligns with 

our operator, Marriott International. The anticorruption policy1 

of Marriott International complies with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt 

Practices Act (“FCPA”) and the UK Bribery Act. All new employees 

are required to attend mandatory awareness training on the 

company’s policies.

In 2019, there were no legal cases regarding corruption which 

were brought against the Group, or its subsidiaries during the year 

under review. We aim to have zero incident of corruption in 2020. 

We are also introducing a Global Anti-Corruption training for our 

employees in 2020.

Socioeconomic Compliance (GRI 419-1)

Compliance is not only a legal obligation but also an ethical 

and moral requirement. We continue to pursue this as our top 

priority, ensuring that our business practices are conducted in 

accordance to local and international laws as well as to standards 

and policies. Employees receive regular training to keep up to date 

with any changes to relevant laws, regulations and policies. We 

have implemented the “Risk Management: Security is Everyone’s 

Responsibility” training for our employees to assess the potential 

risks that can materialize.

In 2019, there was no fines from non-compliance with any laws, 

regulations, codes, standards and policies. We aim to maintain 

a clean record with no incident of regulatory non-compliance in 

2020. 

Customer Privacy (GRI 418-1)

Our customers’ data is treated with strict confidentiality at BCI. 

With the ever-changing technological advances and increasing 

data security threats, we have put in place robust system controls 

to safeguard our customers’ information. We comply with the 

requirements in the Chinese Standard on Personal Information 

Security Specification, which covers the collection, storage, use, 

sharing, transfer, and disclosure of personal information, so as to 

reduce the risks of data breach and exposure. In 2020, we will also 

be introducing the Information Security and Protection Training 

(ISPT) for our employees to understand the protocols of dealing 

with sensitive information.

OUR BUSINESS

1 Any person acting on behalf of Marriott International or any of its affiliates (“Marriott”) must engage in honest competition and observe applicable anti-corruption and 

anti-bribery directives set forth in the Marriott Corporate Policy Manual [Ethical Conduct, Global Anti-Corruption (Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.K. Bribery Act), 

Enterprise Records Management and Centralized Procurement Services , the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and related U.S. laws, and, outside the United States, the 

anti-corruption/anti-bribery laws established by any country in which we are conducting business.

Services Quality, Customer Well-Being

We pride ourselves in providing a quality and secure experience 

for our customers. Looking after the safety and well-being of our 

customers is of utmost importance, to create a sense of security 

and comfort to navigate their daily lives. We continue to review and 

benchmark our safety standards against the industry best practices 

and strive to improve our safety measures in our buildings.

Customer Satisfaction

Through a system of guest/tenant feedback and other forms of 

stakeholder engagement, we formulate policies and best practices 

for a positive and enriching experience and environment for our 

stakeholders and local communities. The ability to retain existing 

customers and attract new customers is critical to business 

sustainability. We prioritise our strong relationships with our 

guests and customers by continually striving to improve our service 

standards and making our customers feel completely at home. 

Our senior management teams are fully committed to reading 

every feedback form submitted by our customers and will take the 

necessary follow-up action.

Customer Well-Being

In Westin Bund Center, we adhere strictly to regulated food safety 

standards to ensure the highest levels of food safety. To raise health 

and safety awareness among our hotel guests, we have included 

safety signage in public spaces and constantly engaged our hotel 

guests through talks, activities and fire drills. In 2019, there were 

16 injuries involving members of the public. Most of the reported 

incidents were due to human error caused by visitors. After each 

incident, a detailed investigation is carried out and results of the 

investigation will clearly spell out the cause and repercussions, as 

well as the corrective action taken to prevent recurrence of similar 

incidents. These reports are subsequently presented and discussed 

at the Monthly Operations Meeting.

Responsible Procurement

We are aware of the broad impact of our everyday activities on our 

operating ecosystem and we are committed to ensuring that our 

supply chain serves us in a responsible and sustainable manner. At 

BCI, our operations are dependent on a reliable supply chain that 

includes food suppliers, building equipment and hotel suppliers.

Responsible Sourcing

Westin Bund Centre is committed to upholding the responsible 

business practices as laid out by our managing operator, Marriott 

International. We follow the Global Procurement Supplier Conduct 

Guidelines2 as guidance and expect our vendors and suppliers to 

operate with the same high standards of compliance and ethics, 

delivering a sustainable sourcing approach across our supply 

chain. We ensure that human rights are respected throughout the 

supply chain without any form of forced or exploitative labour. In 

our commitment to fight against human trafficking, we became 

a signatory of the ECPAT3 Code of Conduct and made human 

trafficking awareness training a requirement for our employees.

In 2019, Westin Bund Center worked closely with our suppliers 

and launched an internal education and awareness campaign on 

responsible seafood at our dining facilities.

2 Marriott’s Global Procurement Supplier Conduct Guidelines (“Supplier Guidelines”) set forth the principles, standards and guidelines that we expect our suppliers to 

uphold and that are applicable to all Marriott officers, managers and employees in Marriott’s global operations.

3 The Tourism Child-Protection Code of Conduct (The Code) is the world’s first and only voluntary set of business principles travel and tour companies can implement to 

prevent sexual exploitation and trafficking of children. The Code provides awareness, tools, and support to the travel and hospitality industry. The Code is a joint venture 

between the tourism private sector and ECPAT. Companies that endorse The Code are supported by ECPAT-USA




12

B U N D  C E N T E R  I N V E S T M E N T  LT D

At BCI, we understand the significant impacts of climate change and 

thus our responsibility to protect and conserve our environmental 

ecosystem. We recognise that our activities could potentially have 

an adverse impact on the environment and we are committed to 

reducing our energy and water usage as well as managing our 

waste more responsibly.  

As part of the environmental compliance and ongoing operational 

permit, BCI abides by stringent health, safety and environmental 

(“HSE”) regulations such as liquid waste management, fire safety 

certification and equipment licenses. Audits are conducted on 

our operational feasibility and permit certificates issued upon 

compliance with these requirements.

ENERGY MANAGEMENT

Energy &amp; Emissions (GRI 302-1, GRI 305-1)

Nature serves as an inspiration in our design process and as 

a commitment to minimising our footprint, our buildings are 

designed with green architectural features to conserve energy, 

and water. By blocking direct sunlight penetration, our buildings 

reduce solar heat thus boosting energy efficiencies and optimise 

air circulation.  The sun also provides natural light to our buildings 

and outdoor common walkways, thus reducing the use of lighting 

energy consumption.

In 2019, Bund Center Office Tower and Westin Bund Center 

continued our efforts to switch to energy saving and sensor-

activated LED lightings in common areas, guest rooms, carpark, 

basements, IT rooms and back of house. This resulted in a 0.9% 

decrease in energy usage and carbon footprint. We continued with 

several other initiatives to reduce consumption of energy across 

our buildings such as an electrical switchboards replacement, 

and other gradual implementation of control timing function 

for our air-conditioning systems. Every little act goes a long way, 

even switching off lights during the lunch period reduces energy 

wastage. Beyond 2019, BCI is looking towards increasing energy 

efficiency by implementing LED lightings system on a level-to-level 

basis.

The PRC government is also promoting the use of more electric 

vehicles to reduce carbon emission and has required office 

buildings to have at least 15% of car park lots to be installed with 

electrical chargers by 2020. We are also exploring obtaining the 

Green Building Certification for our existing buildings.

The Westin Bund Center and Bund Center Office Tower will 

continually seek opportunities to reduce our GHG emissions, and 

aim to install the low nitrogon emission burner for our boilers, 

which will maximise our energy efficiency and reduce our carbon

WATER MANAGEMENT

Water (GRI 303-1)

Water is a valuable resource. We recognise that our business 

operations have an impact on water consumption. The constraints 

on the quality and quantity of water available will limit our ability 

to operate effectively. 

Our efforts at reducing water consumption include a number of 

initiatives. We installed water tap fittings with sensors to reduce 

loss due to overflows. Our water consumption for the cooling tower 

was optimised through water recirculation. Rainwater was collected 

and recycled to water plants and wash common areas.

In 2019, Bund Center Office Tower and Westin Bund Center recorded 

a total water consumption of 449,000m3. Our buildings recorded 

a reduction of 2.6% in water consumption as compared to 2018. 

This is due to the upgrading project on water saving devices in our 

office towers and at the same time, the average occupancy rates 

also dropped which resulted in a reduction of water consumption. 

We continue to monitor our water consumption to minimise water 

wastages and are planning to implement water use monitoring to 

detect abnormal usage patterns by respective business units. We 

also plan to install a new air-con cooling water system to split the 

IT room and chiller on a level-to-level basis, and target to upgrade 

our water saving devices in order to reduce the water intensity by 

1% in 2020.

WASTE MANAGEMENT

Effluents and Waste (GRI 306-2)

Proper waste disposal methods are necessary to prevent any 

contamination in our water systems. We practice waste segregation 

in our buildings and ensure that no hazardous wastes are sent to 

the landfill. Examples of hazardous waste generated on site include 

batteries from lamps and dry cleaning slag, which are disposed by 

authorised, licensed waste disposal contractors.

To improve the recycling initiatives in our buildings, we have rolled 

out a food waste monitoring system – Winnow, in our restaurants 

in late 2019. This system will help us to monitor the type and 

amount of food waste which is being generated, which can help us 

to better understand where and how we can reduce the amount of 

food waste generated in our restaurants. 

Since 2018, we have moved towards a paperless environment in 

all our business units. iPads are used at board meetings, which 

reduced the amount of paper used for printing. Apart from 

reducing the types and amount of wastes that can be reused and 

recycled across our operations, we will continue to work with and 

engage our tenants and the local authorities to strengthen our 

overall approach to waste segregation and management.

In 2019, we recorded 743 tonnes of waste disposed of in our 

hospitality business, with 50 tonnes of waste recycled. The amount 

of non-hazardous waste generated in 2019 was reduced by 

11.9%, from 843 tonnes in 2018 to 743 tonnes in 2019. The lower 

occupancy rates of our hotels and higher volume of recycled items 

from guest rooms contributed to the reduced figure.

People are our most important asset. Our “People First” culture 

drives our efforts to care for both our employees and customers. 

We pride ourselves in providing an inclusive working environment 

with equal employment opportunities based only on objective 

factors. Any form of discrimination based on color, race, religion 

or any other type of distinguishing characteristic is not tolerated. 

Our people culture is based on cultivating a relationship of 

understanding and mutual respect. At BCI, we work hard to ensure 

that we have the right people in the organisation who share our 

values and are passionate to do the right thing. We strive towards 

creating a working environment where our employees take pride 

in their work and are equipped with the right tools to perform their 

tasks and provided opportunities for skills development. Keeping 

our workers engaged is critical for a continued sustainable growth 

of our business. 

We encourage a diversified workforce and hire people from 

different age groups, including the re-employment of persons 

aged above 50. The relatively higher ratio of male to female 

employees is mainly due to the nature of our business of real 

estate and property management and the supply of manpower 

available to us on internship. As an equal opportunity employer, 

a balanced gender composition of our workforce is reflected in 

middle management and higher.

In 2019, BCI employed a total of 611 employees in our operations 

in Shanghai, of whom 58% are males and 42% are females. 

Overall, a total of 85.9% are hired on a permanent basis and 14.1% 

of our employees are hired on a temporary basis, with the gender 

breakdown between permanent and temporary employees 

illustrated in the charts on the following pages. Temporary 

employees typically have a term of 6 months. 

EMPLOYEE WELFARE

Employment (GRI-401-1, GRI 401-2, GRI 401-3)

We recognise that it is our responsibility as an employer to 

provide a conducive and inclusive workplace for our employees’ 

development, well-being and satisfaction, in turn, boosting 

employee morale. Employee retention is crucial to maintain a 

continuous success at BCI.  Through our engagement activities, we 

observed significant levels of satisfaction among our employees. 

BCI recorded a total voluntary turnover of 109 with an overall 

turnover rate of 17.8% in 2019 which is lower than the national 

average. This serves as a testament to our initiatives in improving 

employees’ well-being and satisfaction.

BCI prioritises employees’ welfare. We believe in providing a 

competitive remuneration package guided by legal standards and 

based on their experience, position, and competency. Other benefits 

including insurance coverage, healthcare benefits, parental leave, 

subsidy for marriage and grievance, and retirement provisions are 

provided for all our employees. As at 31 December 2019, all female 

employees and male employees took their parental benefits have 

returned to work at the end of their maternity leave and paternity 

leave respectively. Therefore, we recorded a return to work rate of 

100% for both our female and male employees.

FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES 

A diverse working environment encourages an exchange of 

perspectives, driving innovation and delivers better results.  We 

seek to create an inclusive, open work environment that fosters 

collaboration and cohesiveness based on mutual respect.

Equal Employment Opportunity (GRI 405-1, GRI 405-2)

Our hiring process is based only on merit and objective factors. 

We encourage diversity and equal opportunity in our offices 

regardless of age, gender, nationality, qualification, culture and 

industry knowledge. With years of experiences and a wealth of 

knowledge, mature workers continue to be a valuable addition to 

our workforce. In 2019, about 13% of our employees are above the 

age of 50. Women made up approximately 42% of our workforce 

in 2019. 10 different nationalities and 4 disabled employees were 

represented in our workforce in 2019. 

Non-discrimination (GRI 406-1)

A fair working environment should be one that is free of 

discrimination, harassment, bullying and victimisation. Our 

commitment to having fair labour practices is emphasised in 

our employee handbook and employment practices. Our equal 

opportunity policy on employment does not tolerate any form of 

discrimination and all employees should be treated fairly and with 

equal respect. There were no incidents of discrimination in 2019. 

TALENT MANAGEMENT

Training &amp; Development (GRI 404-1, GRI 404-2) 

Talent management and succession planning are vital components 

of our human resource strategy. It is therefore imperative for us 

to better manage our people and maintain our talent pool. We 

are committed to investing in our talent and allocating an annual 

training budget. Our skills development program is developed to 

support their career growth and align the career aspirations of our 

employees. We believe that equipping our employees with the 

skills they require will ensure a continued growth of our business 

and will also allow our employees in their personal development. 

All employees are required to undergo training as part of their 

annual skills enhancement that is related to their job function. 

In 2019, each employee has benefitted from an average of 47.6 

hours of training. We also provide other on-the-job training 

opportunities and sponsor qualified employees for relevant 

professional courses. Our skills development programs cover 

three core areas: developing core competence to ensure we are 

an effective and efficient organisation; providing opportunities 

for skill development to support career development; and line 

management and leadership development to create a talent 

pipeline.

promotion.

WORKPLACE HEALTH &amp; SAFETY 

Occupational Health and Safety (GRI 403-2)

We constantly emphasize on the importance of occupational 

health and safety (OHS) and well-being of our employees in the 

workplace and instill a culture of responsible, safe work practices 

that are in line with the Government’s regulations. We continue 

to recommend, monitor and review safety procedures while 

identifying potential risks. In ensuring that our practices are in 

line with the best practices of the industry, we have put in place 

reporting procedures for all accidents and injuries at the workplace. 

We take OHS incidents very seriously. All incidents are reported 

to the Safety Department, which will be included in the Monthly 

Operation Report that is submitted to Division Heads. For some 

categories of incidences, such as breakdown of equipment, and 

near misses due to negligence, an investigation report with follow-

up actions will also be submitted to the Division Heads. 

In addition, we send our employees for training in workplace safety 

and first aid in the event of a medical emergency. They are also 

trained in handling fire hazards at the work place, and participate 

regularly in fire drills and evacuation exercises.

Our OHS initiatives include safety checks to ensure compliance by 

our employees and contractors; and the annual OHS equipment 

certification for compliance with the fire safety standards of the 

Shanghai Fire Control Bureau. We have implemented the following 

important layers of occupational health and safety checks to ensure 

the occupational health and safety compliance at our premises:

1. 

Increased frequency of checking by the project Environmental 

Health and Safety team on daily and weekly basis; 

2. 

Regular quality assurance, assessment on risk and control on 

OHS and environment by Colliers International.

There were no fatalities or instances of occupational diseases in our 

Hospitality and Asset Management divisions in FY2019. However, 

we had a total of 500 lost days due to twenty workplace-related 

accidents, with more than half of them taking place in our hotel 

kitchens. We are committed to continuing accessing and improving 

our internal controls to reduce the occurrence of accidents, injuries 

and illnesses at our workplaces.

In response to the current Covid-19 outbreak, BCI has significantly 

provided donations as well as other supports, to help those 

impacted. We have donated medical protective supplies, 

consumable and disposable medical devices, pharmaceuticals, 

disinfection supplies and cleaning supplies to Wuhan and other 

affected cities. With the help and effort of overseas staff and 

assistance from local district government for custom clearance, 

200,000 surgical masks were handed over to Huangpu district 

government in February 2020.  We have also made financial 

contributions to help purchase masks, protection suits and
