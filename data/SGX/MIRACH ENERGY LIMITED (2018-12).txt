1 BOARD STATEMENT 

 

We are pleased to present the second annual Sustainability Report of Mirach Energy Limited 

(“Mirach”, the “Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) for our financial year 

ended 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”). This report is prepared in compliance with the requirements 

of Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Rules 711A and 711B, and 

references the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards. We have chosen to report using the GRI 

Standards because it is an internationally recognised reporting framework that covers a 

comprehensive range of sustainability disclosures. Moreover, the structured framework promotes 

reporting a full and balanced picture of Mirach’s material matters and the management of its impact. 

This report highlights the key economic, environmental, social and governance (“EESG”) related 

initiatives carried throughout a 12-month period, from 1 January to 31 December 2018. 

 

Sustainability is a part of the Group’s wider strategy to create long-term value for all its stakeholders. 

As such, the key material EESG factors for the Group have been identified and cautiously reviewed 

by the management. The data and information provided have not been verified by an independent 

third party. We have relied on internal data monitoring and verification to ensure accuracy of data 

and information. The board of directors of the Group (the “Board”) oversees the management and 

monitoring of these factors and takes them into consideration in the determination of the Group’s 

strategic direction and policies.  

 

We welcome feedback from our stakeholders with regards to our sustainability efforts as this enables 

us to consistently improve our policies, systems and results. Please send your comments and 

suggestions to info@mirachenergy.com.

2 ORGANISATIONAL PROFILE  

 

Mirach Energy Limited has been listed on the Singapore Exchange since 2004. It has pared down a 

large part of its oil and gas business in the past two years and diversified into real estate, construction 

and agriculture land development businesses.  

 

For the oil and gas interests, the Group is presently holding a minority interest in Gunung Indah 

Lestari Limited which holds 100% shares of a KSO operatorship in a marginal oil field in Indonesia.  

 

For Property and Construction business, Mirach holds interests in projects to build houses in West 

Malaysia. The Company hopes to grow further in this industry going forward, whenever the 

opportunity arises. 

 

For new businesses, the Group acquired a 70% equity interest in RCL Kelstar Sdn. Bhd (“RCL”) 

permitting Mirach to participate in an agriculture project in Malaysia. The Company has also formed 

a wholly-owned subsidiary Mirach HP Management Pte. Ltd. (“MHPM”) to provide business and 

management consultancy services. 

 

OUR INTERESTS IN ASIA  

Malaysia  

In 2017, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, CPHL (HK) Limited (“CPHL”) and PRG Construction 

Sdn. Bhd. (“PCSB”) jointly incorporated Premier Mirach Sdn.Bhd. (“PMSB”) to pursue property and 

construction projects in Malaysia. CPHL and PCSB has a 75% and 25% shareholding in PMSB 

respectively. The current ongoing project is expected to be completed by April 2020. 

 

On 18 July 2018, the Group signed a Share Sale Agreement to acquire a 70% equity interest in RCL 

Kelstar Sdn. Bhd (“RCL”). RCL, in cooperation with the Kelantan State Economic Development 

Corporation (“KSEDC”), was set up to manage the development of a multi-storey agricultural project 

(“Project”) in Malaysia. KSEDC has been granted a fifty-year land concession of approximately 5,500 

acres. RCL in turn secured the rights to jointly undertake the Project together with KSEDC. 

 

As at 31 December 2018, RCL entered into three cooperation agreements with business partners, 

whereby each of the business partners is allowed to cultivate and sell durian trees and fruits on 

approximately 550 acres or 10% of the concession land.  

 

Indonesia 

In 2013, CHPL acquired minority interests of 10% in Gunung Kampung Minyak Ltd (“GKM”) in 

Indonesia. In 2018, the interest in GKM was diluted to 9%.

3 SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH 

 

OUR SUSTAINABILITY METHODOLOGY 

 

STAKEHOLDERS ENGAGEMENT  

An important starting point in our sustainability journey is to identify our stakeholders and material 

factors relevant to our business. The interests and requirements of key stakeholders are also taken 

into account when formulating corporate strategies. These key stakeholders include, but are not 

limited to shareholders, employees, customers, supplies, contractors and authorities. We adopt both 

formal and informal channels of communication to understand the needs of key stakeholders, and 

incorporate these into our corporate strategies to achieve mutually beneficial relationships.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT  

Our sustainability process begins with the identification of relevant factors. Relevant factors are then 

prioritised to identify material factors which are subject to validation. The end result of this process is 

a list of material factors disclosed in the Sustainability Report. Process of which are as shown below: 

 

 

 

The Group has conducted a materiality assessment during the year with the assistance of an external 

consultant. We engaged our employees from different departments, seeking our internal 

stakeholders’ feedback for prioritisation of these topics. Going forward, materiality review will be 

conducted every year, incorporating inputs gathered from stakeholders’ engagements. 

 

In order to determine if a factor is material, we assessed its potential impact on the economy, 

environment and society and its influence on the stakeholders. Applying the guidance from GRI, we 

have identified the following as our material factors:

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

Mirach is committed to grow our customers and exceed our customers’ expectations and providing 

them with competitive edge products by enhancing operational efficiency by incorporating effective 

use of technology, develop performance measures, communicate outcomes and results and 

implement necessary changes to provide fast and high quality services at low transactional costs.  

 

Due to the weak economic climate in the Indonesian Oil Exploration sector, the Group ceased 

operations and surrendered the KM Oil Field in 2017, following the termination of the KSO agreement. 

The Group still retains minority ownership of Gunung Kampung Minyak Ltd in Indonesia. 

 

For the financial year ended 31 December 2018, total revenue for the Group reported higher at 

US$3.711 million.  

 

The pre-development and management services obligations provided to the agriculture business 

partners have generated approximately US$2.877 million of revenue for the Group in 2018 while the 

construction activity for the first housing project situated in the Malaysia State of Perak is at 14.4% 

completion and has generated approximately US$0.730 million revenue for the Group. PMSB expects 

to complete the project in April 2020. 

 

For detailed financial results, please refer to the Operation Review section pages “6 to 7” in our Annual 

Report 2018.  

 

ANTI-CORRUPTION 

Mirach does not tolerate corruption in any form. Any report of corruption will be escalated to the 

attention of the Chairman. There is no anti-corruption policy. We prohibit corruption in all forms, 

including extortion and bribery. As set out in our whistle-blowing policy, all complaints shall be 

reported to the Audit Committee Chairman of the Company either in person or via an email that is 

only accessible by the Audit Committee Chairman. Similar to FY2017, there were no reported incidents 

of corruption during FY2018.  

 

Target: To maintain zero incidents of corruption.

5 ENVIRONMENTAL  

 

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE 

The Group takes measures to protect environment such as energy savings on water and electricity and 

use of recyclable office stationeries. Office air conditioners are set permanently at energy savings 

levels of 24 to 25 degrees Celsius. Lights are also turned off during lunch time so as not to waste 

unnecessary electricity. The Company has taken steps in trying to save the forest by printing its annual 

reports on recycled paper for many years. 

 

With the Group going into new real estate and construction business, it is determined to work closely 

with its team to determine the variables that the Group can control in the construction and real estate 

environment in the new projects. 

 

There were also no incidence of non-compliance with laws and regulations resulting in significant fines 

or sanctions in FY2018.   

 

Target: To maintain zero incidents of non-compliance.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

With the Group going into new real estate and construction business in 2017 and 2018, we will 

strengthen and monitor the occupational health and safety of our employees. We will be committed 

to safeguarding our employees’ health and safety against any potential workplace hazards. We create 

the Occupational Health and Safety awareness by pasting the policy in the conspicuous place and put 

the safety sign at site. We are proud to report that there were also no work place incidents for FY2018. 

 

Target: To maintain zero incidents of work place injury.  

 

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY  

Although the group’s staff strength is very small, Mirach ensures compliance with labour and 

employment laws, including working hours. Furthermore, we ensure that no colleagues should be 

discriminated against because of age, gender, national origin, disability, religion, sexual orientation, 

marital or maternity status, union membership or political opinion, among others. Non-compliance in 

relation to discrimination is reportable through our whistleblowing system.  Below shows the group’s 

staff composition chart in FY2018. We have an increase of 25% headcount in our Organisation 

Governance Bodies and remains the same in our employee level:  

 

Target: We target to have zero instance of discrimination in FY2019.

TRAINING AND EDUCATION 

Mirach understands that there is a continuous need to upgrade staff skills and knowledge. This is 

beneficial to the staff development and also to the Company. Thus, staff are encouraged to go for 

courses and seminars to keep themselves updated of the latest rules and regulations and the market 

investment trends. 

 

In Singapore, employees are given the opportunity to select trainings they wish to attend, 

recommended by HR or on ad-hoc basis. In Singapore office, staff are required to have a minimum of 

1 half day training session for staff in 1 year. This has been achieved both in FY2017 and FY2018.  

 

Target: We aim to provide more trainings to our employees in FY2019.  

 

LOCAL COMMUNITIES 

The Group firmly upholds fair employment practices and values each employee in the organization. 

We are committed in developing each employee to its full potential by providing equality of 

opportunities and promoting a healthy, positive and cohesive environment. We strive to also 

contribute in each country it is in, in small ways of red-cross donations, with the Company’s limited 

resources currently.  

 

Target: With more resources in future, the Group hopes to embark on some larger scale community 

work and engage its staff in values creation work for the benefit of the society.
