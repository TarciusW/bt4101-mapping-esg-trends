Sustainability Report 

2018








1. 

Mewah International Inc. published our first 

sustainability report in year 2017. In this second 

report, we remain focus on the core areas which 

are spelled out in our Sustainability Framework. 

We seek to strengthen and continue to improve 

on this framework. 

Through 

this 

sustainability 

report, 

we 

endeavour to provide our stakeholders with an 

understanding of our sustainability approach, 

the measurements we have in place and our 

approach in building a sustainable business.

2. 

We have sought to seek guidance from the 

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standard index 

for boundary settings, focusing on performance 

data and reporting on aspects which are most 

significant, as reflected in our Sustainability 

Framework and our Sustainable Palm Oil Policy.

 

3. 

The content of this report focuses primarily 

on our refineries and manufacturing plants 

in Malaysia and Singapore. There has no 

restatement of information in the scope of 

our reporting from the previous report. We 

plan to progressively extend the scope of our 

reporting to cover other business segments 

more comprehensively in forthcoming reports 

as we increase our reporting capacity and 

understanding of our new businesses.

4. 

In order to define the contents of this report, we 

have worked with our stakeholders to identify our 

key risk areas. Such data is collected and analysed 

to further discern and design improvement plans 

qualitatively and annually.

5. 

In relation to our Crude Palm Oil (CPO) and 

Crude Palm Kernel Oil (CPKO) supply chain, the 

reporting will be based on policies, traceability 

milestones and progress in Traceability to Mill 

(TTM) &amp; Traceability to Plantation (TTP). The 

performance data will also focus on identifying 

material 

ESG 

(Environmental, 

Social, 

and 

Governance) factors in our refinery operations.

MEWAH INTERNATIONAL INC. 






At Mewah, we continue to evaluate and make changes in our 

operations and throughout our value chain to minimise our 

manufacturing emissions and improve our environmental footprint 

per metric-ton of product produced. We focus our efforts on key 

areas where our portfolio and business scale allow us to have the 

biggest impact that offer the biggest opportunities for our business. 

We drive collaboration throughout our supply chain in an effort 

to reduce our climate impact associated with our raw materials 

processing till delivering our products to the hands of our buyers.

This focus area covers our impact on various environmental 

footprints in terms of: 

1) 

Energy efficiency/ Carbon footprint

2) 

Water management/ Water footprint

3) 

Waste management/ Waste footprint 

 

The processing of edible oils is both complex and energy-

intensive. Mewah’s processing plants differ in capacity, capability 

and range of value-added products. This will bring about different 

environmental footprint in different facilities. However, we continue 

to relentless drive reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG), water and 

waste emissions within our own manufacturing operations. 

 



FOCUS AREA 1: 

MINIMIZING OUR 

ENVIRONMENTAL 

FOOTPRINT












CORE AREA 1:  

ENERGY EFFICIENCY/ CARBON FOOTPRINT 

Carbon footprint is defined as the total amount of 

greenhouse gases (GHG) that is produced directly 

and indirectly associated with our manufacturing 

activities. The standard unit of measurement for 

carbon footprint is carbon dioxide equivalents 

(CO2e). GHG Emissions is an all-encompassing 

measurement for the carbon footprint and energy 

efficiency in our production. 

At Mewah, we are mindful that increasing carbon 

footprint has profound effects on the environment. 

To this end we seek to measure our GHG emissions, 

identify the key emission sources and develop plans 

to reduce these emissions.

The primary contributing factors of GHG emissions 

in our production sites are:

i. 

Electricity consumption,

ii. 

Chemicals consumption,

iii. 

Fuel consumption.

We have developed a standard methodology to 

measure our GHG emissions from our production 

activity.  These numbers are compiled on a monthly 

basis, evaluated and projects are in place to further 

improve these consumption figures.

1.1.1 

GHG 

EMISSIONS 

IN 

OUR 

PRODUCTION SITES

Our greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) index 

depicts the results of quantity of GHGs emitted 

per metric-ton of product processed or packed in 

our manufacturing premises. The measurement 

is in kilograms of carbon dioxide-equivalent per 

metric ton of product (kg CO2e/MT). The total GHG 

emission decreased by 4.85% from 38.55(kg CO2e/

MT) to 36.68 (kg CO2e/MT) over the period of 2018.

MEWAH INTERNATIONAL INC. 


In Mewah Datu Sdn Bhd, we utilize the fiber from empty fruit bunch (EFB) 

and palm kernel shell (PKS) as boiler fuel to replace fossil fuel. The EFB 

and PKS are the solid waste from oil palm obtained from milling process. 

This agricultural waste is considered to have zero life-cycle greenhouse gas 

emissions up to the point of collection.

The utilization of biomass as fuel has helped to greatly reduce the net carbon 

emissions in our production process and it has improved our operating cost 

at the same time. 

The usage of biomass energy is one of our sustainability efforts in minimizing 

the carbon footprint in our operation and we are proud to say that the 

greenhouse gas emission in our process has been successfully improved 

since year 2014 as we have progressively maximizing the utilization of 

biomass materials in boiler fuel.

CORE AREA 2:  

WATER MANAGEMENT/ WATER FOOTPRINT

1.2.1 OUR FOCUS &amp; ACTION PLAN 

The water footprint maps and measures how, when 

and where we use freshwater resources. In Mewah, 

we have integrated water footprint assessment as 

part of the group sustainability initiative and business 

strategy through: 

I. 

Setting quantitative water footprint reduction 

targets in all manufacturing sites 

II. 

Apply standard terminology &amp; calculation 

methods

III. 

Monthly assessment on quality &amp; quantity of 

wastewater discharge

Our action plan in reducing our water consumption 

includes: 

I. 

Consistently assessing water-related impacts 

and risks across our supply chain. 

II. Identify uses of water in our factories and set 

targets to reduce fresh water use.

III. Continue to improve conservation efforts 

(water-saving efforts) at our factories. 

One of our key initiatives to improve our water footprint 

is to recycle rainwater for various requirements 

by the factories. The efforts made so far recorded 

consumption efficiency at 0.19m³/product for all the 

manufacturing sites. In addition to this, we are also 

monitoring the impact of water discharged into rivers 

met the qualified quality. Thus far, the quality of the 

discharged water met the national environmental 

limit ie. the permissible limit of BOD and COD are at 

50ppm and 200ppm respectively.

EFFECTIVE MICROORGANISMS (EM) MUD 

BALL CLEAN-UP FOR SUNGAI BULUH, 

PASIR GUDANG 

In a bid to shed light on the myriad of positive impacts 

of mud balls have on water quality improvement, 

Mewaholeo Industries has collaborated with Pasir 

Gudang Municipal Council (MPPG) and Kemuncak 

Resources in initiating a water quality awareness 

program “Care for our River”.

In this program, our people were guided on the 

purpose of the Effective Microorganisms (EM) mud 

balls and the making process of mud ball. The EM 

mud balls are made up of a combination of earth, EM 

treated rice-rinsed solution and “Bakashi”, a fermented 

organic matter made using sawdust and bran. The 

mixture is patted into balls for slow disbursement in 

the river. Mass dumping of these concoctions will not 

only break down harmful bacteria in the rivers, but 

also improve the self-purification ability of rivers by 

rejuvenating the ecosystem of which they are part of 

where lives can be sustained. 

More than 60 of our employees volunteered to 

participate in making more than 900 EM mud balls 

which were subsequently dumped into Sungai 

Buluh river. The transformation was astounding. 

After a period of 3-month mud ball prescription, 

the metre-thick black sludge which smothered the 

riverbed had disappeared. Today, the water quality 

of the river is being monitored and analysed by the 

authority to ensure the positive outcome of the 

program remains sustainable. 

We plan to carry out similar program in the coming years. 



15

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018


























Mudballs enriched with Effective Micro-organisms is a consortium of “good” 

microbes that can degrade pollutants such as those contained within the 

noxious sludge that chokes riverbeds.

Our collaboration with Mewaholeo Industries Sdn. Bhd. commenced in 

year 2018. The collaboration and supports given throughout the program 

were extraordinary and the volunteers are just so-amazing to contribute 

selflessly in cleaning up the river. We hope that through the collaboration 

with Mewaholeo, we could encourage and inspire more industry players to 

organize similar events in future.

CORE AREA 3:  

WASTE MANAGEMENT/ WASTE FOOTPRINT 

Sustainable waste management planning is a massive 

task that involves scientific knowledge, logistical 

planning, and understanding in order to balance the 

impact on our environment and the cost effectiveness 

of the process.

At Mewah Group, we are working on a comprehensive 

waste management plan that include action plan to 

understand our waste streams, to measure/baseline 

current waste generation and to complete a facility-

wide waste operations assessment. The objective of 

our water management plan is to assure a sustainable 

waste material management in our production sites 

by putting in place effective measures. 

1. 

Our waste are divided into 4 main categories:

CATEGORY

TYPE OF WASTE

A

General Waste

B

Scrap Waste

C

Production Waste

D

Schedule Waste

2. 

The amount of waste generated by each 

category is monitored and attention is brought 

to the amount generated. 

3. 

Identify the 4 Rs’ components in managing 

waste: Reduce, Reuse, Recover and Recycle. 

i. 

Reduce: Focus to improve efficiency. To 

establish practices that are capable to 

reduce the amount of waste we generate 

to help the environment.

ii. 

Reuse: Practice to reuse materials without 

change whether for the original or a 

different application instead of throwing 

them away, or pass those unused materials 

on to others who could use them.

iii. 

Recover: To set up ways to recover the 

energy values contained within the waste 

material.

iv. 

Recycle: Many of the things we use every 

day can be recycled. Recycled items are put 

through a process that makes it possible to 

create new products out of the materials 

from the old ones.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018


1.3.1 REDUCING GENERAL WASTE

The concept of waste minimization is fundamental in 

our waste management. In line with our ISO 14001 

certification, we encourage our employees to use 

recyclable and bio-degradable bags and containers 

in order to sustain our environment and ecosystem. 

Moving forward, we plan to enforce “plastic-free” to 

ban the use of plastic bags and polystyrene foodware 

in all our factories. The first step is to set up a practical 

guide to educate our employees on the presence of 

plastic and its harmful effects on the environment.

1.3.2 REUSING SCRAP WASTE

We have a program in place to first reuse all possible 

scrap waste produced, including mild steel, tin, 

zinc, and etc., before being sold for recycling. This 

cost-effective practice ensures that these natural 

resources are fully utilized before being disposed.

1.3.3 RECYCLING SPENT BLEACHING 

EARTH

Spent Bleaching Earth (SBE) is the major source of 

waste generated from our refineries. It contains 20-

25% of residual oil.  Due to the high oil content in the 

Spent Bleaching Earth, its disposal can be considered 

an environmental hazard, as it is highly flammable. 

At Mewah, 100% of our SBE generated from our 

refineries are recycled either as raw material for 

another manufacturer or used as biomass. 

(Note: Bleaching earth is an adsorptive cleansing agent 

used in bleaching process to remove impurities and colour 

pigments in the CPO.) 

1.3.4 RECOVERING SCHEDULE WASTE 

Spent nickel, hydraulic oil, lubricant oil, and waste 

solvent are some of the examples of waste which 

are generated from our production activities. Such 

by-product are highly regulated and they have to 

be disposed of at recovery sites as destinated by 

the Department of Environment (DOE). We have 

complied with these schedule wastes, which are 

recovered and treated by licensed contractors. 

The recovery of such schedule wastes involves 

the removals of harmful or/and contaminated 

substances, in certain instances, the recovery of 

valuable resources.

MEWAH INTERNATIONAL INC. 


OUR 2018 

WASTE FOOTPRINT

Our analysis shows that the production waste 

accounts for 68% of our total waste footprint. The 

spent bleaching earth generated from our refinery 

business makes the largest contribution to our waste 

footprint. This accounts for more than 50% of our total 

waste footprint.

The following pyramid list shows the contribution of 

general waste, scrap waste and schedule waste are 10%, 

8% and 4% respectively of our total waste footprint.

In Ngo Chew Hong Oils &amp; Fats, we adopted “Reduce, Reuse, Recover and 

Recycle (4Rs)” as the major components of waste footprint reduction 

initiative in our business operation. 

As a responsible corporate, we always committed to operate our business 

in a responsible manner. We, at all times, ensure the refining process 

achieved at its efficiency in term of cost effectiveness, and minimized the 

consumption of processing aids such as Bleaching Earth (BE). By controlling 

BE consumption in refinery process, it will reduce the generation of processed 

waste - spent bleaching earth (SBE). Several efforts are being done in to 

realize this objective. In year 2018, we have successfully reduced 7.5% of BE 

consumption as compared to 2017. Thus, this figure is translated into 7.5% 

of reduction in SBE (waste) generation.

 

Conventionally, SBE was disposed into landfills and the waste disposal 

expenses are extremely high. Since 2015, with the collaboration of Eco-

Oils Sdn. Bhd., we supply 100% of the SBE generated for secondary oil 

extraction/ oil recovery purposes. In line with waste management initiative, 

post extraction of SBE is comparatively eco-friendly. The extracted vegetable 

oil (recycle oil) will then be useful for commercial activities, simultaneously, 

it improves carbon footprint in our manufacturing activities.

CORE AREA 1:  

SUSTAINABLE PALM OIL POLICY 

Mewah Group is committed to the implementation of 

a responsible and sustainable palm oil supply chain. 

On August 2014, Mewah announced a Sustainable 

Palm Oil Policy with sustainability commitments 

entailing the company’s entire palm oil supply chain. 

The Policy establishes mechanisms to ensure that 

palm oil in Mewah’s supply chain will be free from 

links to deforestation, peat planting and exploitation 

of human rights of workers.

The provisions in this policy apply to all Mewah’s 

operations worldwide, including our subsidiary 

companies. We expect all our third-party suppliers 

of palm oil products to adhere to our sustainability 

policy commitments for their operations. 

The Mewah’s Sustainable Palm Oil policy is based 

upon the following commitments:

1. 

To build a traceable and transparent supply chain.

2. 

To continue the journey of no deforestation 

and to commit no burning, protection of high 

conservation value (HCV) areas and high carbon 

stock (HCS) areas. 

3. 

To reject new oil palm development in forested 

peatland plantation after May 2015. 

4. 

To respect human rights and ensure protection 

of the rights of all workers.

5. 

To respect the rights of indigenous people and 

local communities to give or withhold Free, 

Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) where oil 

palm development takes place.

TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF 

SUSTAINABLE PALM OIL POLICY

We are committed to transparency and accountability 

in our sustainability program. We note that both 

internal 

and 

external 

stakeholder 

groups 

are 

interested and involved in our engagement efforts.

Our 

efforts 

to 

increase 

transparency 

and 

accountability have been done through:

• 

Annual Sustainability Performance Reporting in 

accordance to GRI standard

• 

Open Sustainability Dashboard &amp; half-yearly 

palm traceability score update

• 

RSPO Annual Communication on Progress 

(ACOP) Submission

• 

Continual stakeholders engagement 

• 

Grievance-handling procedures

CORE AREA 2:  

TOWARDS FULL TRACEABILITY

The palm oil supply chain is complex and fragmented. 

Every tier in the supply chain plays its essential role in 

forging a path to full traceability. Transparency in the 

supply chain is a critical aspect of sustainability since 

it increases the visibility of suppliers and it allows us 

to trace and identify the origin of our raw material.

For every ton of palm oil and palm kernel oil received 

into our factory, we trace to the exact location of the 

palm oil mills and the particulars of FFB suppliers to 

the palm oil mills that supplying to us. Traceability data 

is necessary as it allows us to evaluate our suppliers’ 

performance against our Sustainable Palm Oil Policy. 

At the same time, we are establishing engagement 

with our suppliers with the objectives to improve the 

sustainability standards in our supply chain. This is 

done through traceability data collection, suppliers’ 

assessment and educational workshops.

2.2.2 MEWAH’S TRACEABILITY TO MILL 

(TTM) APPROACH 

In order to register and continuously monitor the 

sustainability performance of suppliers, we seek to 

ensure full transparency in our supply chain. 

The key criteria in our TTM approach are: 

I. 

Parent Company Name of Mill Party

II. 

Mill Name 

III. 

Mill Address 

IV. 

GPS Coordinates of Mill Party 

V. 

Volumes of CPO received into our refinery 

“Traceable to Mill” CPO must fulfil all five (5) key 

criteria. If any of this information is incomplete; the 

volume received from the particular supplier will be 

considered as “untraceable”.

TRACEABILITY 

TO 

PLANTATION (TTP) APPROACH 

In general, a palm oil mill’s fresh fruit bunch (FFB) 

may be supplied by hundreds of estates, growers, 

smallholders as well as dealers. Traceability to 

plantation exercise primarily serves as a tool as well 

as a bridge for us to support the transformation of 

our suppliers’ mill practices and their supply bases 

towards sustainable practices. However, it is vital to 

note that the definition of traceability to plantation 

or FFB traceability is still currently the subject of 

considerable debate because there is no common 

consensus or standard in the industry. 

2.2.4 COMMITMENT TOWARDS 100% 

TRACEABILITY 

A 100% traceability supply chain is the objective 

that galvanises us in focusing our efforts towards 

improving the sustainability program in our supply 

chain. Our traceability approach helps us in identifying 

the potential risks in our full supply chain while 

increasing our abilities in establishing constructive 

engagement with our suppliers.

Mewah’s 

current 

approach 

on 

traceability 

to 

plantations establish on ensuring the availability and 

validity of Malaysia Palm Oil Board (MPOB) operating 

license from FFB suppliers. The rationale behind our 

requirement is to make sure that all FFB supplied to 

the palm oil mills are sourced legally.  

The key criteria in our TTP approach are:

The launch of our Traceability to Mill (TTM) exercise 

in 2014 and Traceability to Plantation (TTP) exercise 

in 2016 enabling us to reach out to a greater number 

of suppliers including millers, estates’ owners, dealers 

and smallholders. The traceability data collected 

from TTM and TTP exercise allowed us to map all the 

palm oil mills that supply CPO to our four refineries 

and the estates, dealers and smallholders that supply 

FFB to the mills. 

In March 2018, Bursa Malaysia Derivatives announced 

the revamp of Crude Palm Oil Futures where the 

Sellers are now required to provide traceability to mill 

data. This is a major breakthrough for the Malaysia’s 

palm industry. By improving the transparency 

standards of the industry, it is now possible to improve 

the transparency of the industry.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018










In Mewah, we believe that change is good, transformation is even better. 

Since year 2017, we initiated our traceability to plantation exercise and 

on-site assessment to more than 140 third-party suppliers in our supply 

chain. We aspire to be a catalyst to drive positive transformation in our 

supply chain, moving sustainable palm oil agenda forward by sharing 

responsible practices and creating awareness among our suppliers. We 

realized significant milestones in year 2018 by achieving 100% CPO Futures 

traceable to mills as well as 77% and 73% traceability to plantation for CPO 

and CPKO.

The greatest challenges in realizing our pre-set traceability goal are the 

complexity of the supply chain and the willingness of suppliers to share 

their traceability information. We will continue to work with these suppliers 

on full transparency and traceability of our supply chain in year 2019.

CORE AREA 3:  

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

2.3.1 SUPPLY CHAIN ASSESSMENT TO 

HIGH-RISK MILLS

We actively engage our supplier base. We carry out 

field assessment by auditing the mills that supply 

to our refineries. We started this process by first 

conducting field assessment at mills located in high 

risk areas based on geospatial analysis.

The primary purposes of carrying out mill assessment:

 

1. 

To understand the context in the FFB supply 

base in palm oil mill. 

2. 

To work with suppliers to create shared value 

through supply chain to make sure there is no 

major issue with the supply chain. 

Through our supplier engagement activities, we 

manage to influence and encourage our suppliers to 

adopt sustainable farming practices and responsible 

milling 

operations. 

Three 

basic 

assessment 

techniques used are: interview, spot observation 

and documentation review. 

The major audit areas during our assessment to palm 

oil mill are: 

A. 

Chemical stores – Storage, herbicide mixing 

areas, personal protective equipment (PPE), 

ventilation and security. 

B. 

Field inspections – Herbicide application, 

harvesting sites, fertilizing operations, first 

aiders and boxes, and field observation of all 

operations are following the SOP. 

C.

ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM (HIMEP) 

The launching of HIMEP program in 2018 enables 

us to prioritize key suppliers’ group and to tailor 

a structural and systematic training program for 

them. The primary objective of this program is to 

identify if any lacking policy commitments among 

our suppliers’ group.

In total 50 high important palm oil mills were 

identified through the volumes of CPO supplied 

to our refineries. These HIMEP mills covered more 

than 50% of Mewah’s CPO supply chain for the year 

2017. The key focus in our transformation work is to 

improve the conventional milling practices, labour 

living/working conditions, and to instil commitment 

towards achieving sustainability certification.

We evaluated the overall sustainability performance 

of our key suppliers’ group by the following criteria:

A. 

Traceability 

Score 

(e.g., 

indicator 

of 

Transparency)

B. 

NDPE Awareness 

(e.g., 

Availability 

of 

a 

recognized NDPE Policy/ Sustainable Palm Oil 

Policy)

C. 

Sustainability Commitment (e.g., Availability 

of a voluntary sustainability certification and/

or other national mandatory sustainability 

certification)

D. 

Environmental Risk (e.g., geospatial analysis 

via Global Forest Watch platform) 

E. 

Social Impact (e.g., via on-site assessment 

through interview, policies/plans/program)

The results of this sustainability performance 

analysis have helped us to customize appropriate 

support and even intervention strategies, where 

this is needed. Some crucial findings include the 

need to build capacity in order to adopt sustainable 

agricultural &amp; milling practices and the urgency to 

improve transparency in sourcing of FFB. The HIMEP 

program has indirectly helps us to gauge the degree 

of alignment of these “high important mills” in 

accordance to  Mewah’s Sustainable Palm Oil Policy.

2.3.4 MEWAH’S SUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT 

PROGRAM

Supplier engagement is beyond traceability exercise. 

The main objectives of supplier engagement are 

to create awareness to our upstream suppliers, to 

increase interaction between our suppliers &amp; buyers, 

to spread responsible palm oil practices and to build 

up supplier capacity to adapt sustainability practices. 

Our focus is to continually raise the standard of the 

palm oil industry by sharing our experience, technical 

expertise, and knowledge by providing training and 

technical assistance to ensure that our suppliers have 

the right skills and motivation to deliver our goals. 

We see three crucial benefits from Supplier 

Engagement Program: 

i. 

Multi-stakeholders approach - The opportunity 

to socialize our Sustainable Palm Oil Policy with 

our direct suppliers. 

ii. 

A platform to discuss the implications and 

requirement of adopting similar policies. 

iii. 

A platform to create awareness of the market 

demands for the need to delink our palm oil supply 

chain from deforestation, oil palm development 

of peatland and human rights abuses. 

In year 2018, we have successfully gathered more 

than 50 participants from a number of key suppliers 

group from palm oil mills and kernel crushers for our 

annual Supplier Engagement Workshop on “Labour &amp; 

Human Rights” in our refinery, Mewah-Oils Sdn Bhd. 

2.3.5 

SMALLHOLDER 

ENGAGEMENT 

PROGRAM

Smallholders are important stakeholders in our 

sustainability journey as they comprise around 40% 

of Malaysia palm oil production. In conjunction with 

our supplier engagement program, we endeavour 

by extending our engagement exercises to the 

smallholders group especially the independent 

smallholders who account for a significant proportion 

of the oil palm production in Malaysia. 

 

In 2018, we partnered with a key buyer and a major supplier 

to initiate a smallholder empowerment sustainability 

program. The purpose of this collaborating initiative 

is to connect the independent smallholder farmers to 

our Buyers. This may then lead to empowerment and 

adoption of sustainable agricultural practices.

APPROACH

SASPO  

(Support Asia for Sustainable Palm Oil) Green 

Member 

In August 2018, one of our subsidiaries, Ngo Chew 

Hong Edible Oils Pte Ltd embarked on its sustainability 

journey with SASPO in order to promote demand for 

sustainable palm oil. 

SASPO (SUPPORT ASIA FOR SUSTAINABLE PALM 

OIL) was founded in 2016 by seven founding 

members; ASEAN CSR Network, Ayam Brand, 

Danone, IKEA, Unilever, Wildlife Reserves Singapore 

and WWF-Singapore. The alliance is the first 

business initiative in ASEAN focusing on sustainable 

palm oil. Through capacity building, workshops and 

educational resources, SASPO managed to lower 

the barriers for businesses in adopting sustainable 

sourcing policies.

CORE AREA 4:  

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE 

The palm oil supply chain can be long and complex. 

Although we have set up action plan to carry out supply 

chain assessment to ensure that our suppliers are fully 

commit to our Sustainable Palm Oil Policy; we recognize 

that policy breaches may go unnoticed given the large 

scale of our operation especially for third-party suppliers 

that do not feed directly into our supply chain. 

We started the Grievance Procedure on our 

Sustainability Dashboard since June 2016. This 

procedure serves as a platform for all stakeholders 

in our supply chain to address concerns or to report 

complaints that can be found in Mewah Sustainability 



Dashboard. The Grievance Procedure is to ensure 

that we are responsive to grievances from external 

parties. This includes any individuals, government 

organizations, NGOs or media outlets with concerns 

related to the implementation of Mewah’s Sustainable 

Palm Oil Policy. 

In Mewah, we value the input of stakeholders in 

helping to achieve the aims of the policies and in 

enhancing transparency throughout our supply chain. 

We will be providing regular progress updates via the 

Mewah Group Ongoing Sustainability Grievances on 

our Sustainability Dashboard.

3.3.1 RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION

Hiring and retaining talented employees are crucial to 

the success and growth of any business. Today, with 

the competition for talents growing more intensive, 

our recruitment focusses not only on job skills but 

also on positive personal attributes such as leadership.

Retention is also key to a successful healthy work 

culture of any vibrant and dynamic organisation. 

Retention means less disruption and more stability. 

This translates to a sustainable workforce which 

creates a sustainable work culture and a successful 

organisation orientated towards its workforce.

These practices include listening to and respecting 

our employees’ feedback on their concerns and 

ideas, setting up performance-based rewards and a 

direct engagement platform by assisting them with 

their career development. We recognize too that our 

employees must feel engaged, valued and appreciated.

3.3.2 RECOGNIZING AND REWARDING 

PERFORMANCE 

We recognize every employee is vital to the growth 

and progress of the company. Our recognition and 

reward framework aim to retain and motivate the 

talent needed to grow and sustain our business.

We constantly seek to establish clear communication 

between managers and employees about what they 

are expected to accomplish. The performance-based 

system is a continuous process where managers and 

employees set goals through annual tasks &amp; objectives 

(T&amp;O) exercise. The T&amp;O set is then translated into 

departmental T&amp;O and individual employee T&amp;O 

so that every employee are aligned to our overall 

objective of building a sustainable business.

3.3.3 TRAINING AND EDUCATION

Training and education are investments in human 

capital that delivers benefits to both employee and 

employer. We support our employees in their work 

and career goals by identifying training needs and 

development opportunities. The most important 

form of development is on the job training whereby 

the supervisor will identify key stretch goals and 

The captain is as good as his team”. Sound familiar? For those of us who 

follow a team sport, we often hear this. Marshall Goldsmith, the legendary 

leadership coach, in an article aptly titled, ‘You are only as good as your 

team’ says: “For the great achiever, it’s all about ‘me’; for the great leader, it’s 

all about ‘them’.“

A leader deal with and shield the teams from various organizational 

constraints, navigate conflicts, and nurture the culture at the workplace to 

deliver results. It is however no one is born a leader. Teams play an important 

role in nurturing and shaping the leader. The case for this support is even 

more pronounced for a new leader, who needs feedback, affirmation and 

the trust that they are in the game together with the team.

In year 2017, we collaborate with Leadership Resources to launch the 7 Habits 

Highly Effective Peoples training program for our employees. The result 

from this training is remarkable as since the 7 Habits are based on principle, 

the training brings the maximum long-term beneficial results possible.

“Our purpose, values and principles form our culture, and this culture is 

the secret sauce in Mewah” The principles have today become the basis of 

our character creating an empowering centre of correct maps from which 

our people can effectively solve problems, maximize opportunities and 

continuously learn &amp; integrate other principles in an upward spiral of growth.

 

On a side note, it helps us to make sure that each and every employee has the 

opportunity to unleash their potential, however high or low it is perceived to be. 

That isn’t just for the benefit of the employee, but for the business continuity.

regular sit-downs with the employee to ensure 

consistent feedback on their key objectives. We have

realize their potential in order to pursue their careers

SAFETY FRAMEWORK

Mewah Group Safety Framework is established as the 

guiding safety principle that aims to improve safety 

performance in our factories. Our targets of zero 

accident and zero fatality have been emphasized in 

the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for all levels 

of employees.

The Mewah Group Safety Framework focuses on 6 

core areas: 

A. 

Plant design

B. 

Safety procedure 

C. 

People focus 

D. 

Training &amp; awareness

E. 

Emergency management 

F. 

Enforcement 

Every incident case is followed up in collaboration 

with the Department of Safety, Health &amp; Environment 

through identification of unsafe act and condition to 

reduce risk of recurrence. In 2018, we introduced 

a robust group safety framework in all factories. 

Besides, a series of group safety awareness activities 

have been carried out with the aim to improve our 

safety performance.

The following figure illustrates the loss time injury 

(LTI) rate has improved by 8% from 2.4 in 2017 to 2.2 

in year 2018. 

At Mewah, our employees are our most important 

tangible resources. Ensuring the health &amp; safety 

of our employees is always our top priority.. We 

want Mewah to be an attractive workplace for our 

employee by ensuring each and every employee is 

healthy and safe both physically and mentally.

Workplace safety is everybody’s concern. Any 

work-related injury or loss of life is unacceptable 

to us. We are committed to ensuring the workplace 

is a conducive working environment by adopting 

the following:

A. 

Establishing a Safety Framework to identify, 

correct, and control hazards on an ongoing basis. 

B. 

Creating awareness among all employees – every 

production site hosts a least one health, safety 

and environment (HSE) campaign every year. 

C. 

Evaluating overall efficiency and effectiveness 

of production and operation premise’s safety 

management practices through internal and 

external inspections.

D.

MANAGING AND IMPROVING WORKPLACE SAFETY

To support this safety framework, we have a 

comprehensive workplace safety program to improve 

workplace safety. To measure the effectiveness of 

these programs, we have adopted a measurement 

of both leading and lagging indicators. We choose 

to focus not only on lagging indicators (e.g. Lost 



time injury rate) that report on the outcomes of 

safety initiatives, but also give equal consideration 

to leading indicators (e.g. training, safety audits, 

safety suggestions) that measure our employee 

safety behaviour and mindset. By engraining safety 

as a part of a culture and habit, we hope to minimise 

unsafe employee behaviour.

To further improve the safety mindset, we seek to 

implement the following safety initiatives throughout 

our factories:  

A. 

Initiate Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study 

&amp; Hazard Identification (HAZIP) methodology 

throughout the factories

CSR PROGRAM: DONATION TOWARD SHERUN OLD 

FOLKS HOME &amp; HANDICAP CENTER IN SKUDAI, 

JOHOR

We seek to empower local communities and create 

positive impacts through active volunteerism of our 

employee. Our approach is to ensure that we bring 

direct meaningful and long-lasting benefits to our 

neighbors and local communities that live near to 

our factories. 

Sherun Old Folks Home &amp; Handicap Center, located 

in Skudai, Johor, commenced operation as elderly 

care center since year 2002. It provides shelter, and 

care for more than 100 elderly, handicapped and 

mentally disabled people. The oldfolks home obtains 

financial support from public through donations. 

Since year 2016, our volunteers have made regular 

visitation to the home in order to give donation in the 

form of groceries and essential food items with the 

aim to ease its daily operating expenses.





A. ACTIVE VOLUNTEERISM OF OUR 

EMPLOYEE – TO CREATE POSITIVE 

IMPACT IN OUR COMMUNITIES

We believe that everyone can contribute and make 

a difference to the community and lives of others. 

We encourage our staff to volunteer and give back 

to the community. We believe that active employee 

volunteerism not only helps the community but 

contributes to the holistic development of our 

employee in terms of compassion, perspective and 

character building. Therefore, we hold companywide 

community volunteer events so that the majority of 

our staff can find it easier to volunteer to give back  

to community.

B.SUPPORTING OUR NEXT GENERATION

We believe that every child deserves a chance at 

a life filled with love, laughter, friends and family. 

Every year, a number of fund-raising activities will 

be held internally and externally to distribute funds, 

groceries and stationeries to the children charitable 

organization. Our efforts are not only directed at 

alleviating the disablement of the less fortune children 

but also at giving the child a hope for the future.

C. DISASTER RELIEF 

We wish to support the communities that operate 

in. One of the most important initiatives is to help 

our neighbours in their time of need. When there 

are natural disasters in our neighbourhood, we raise 

money and donate other necessities to support 

victims of natural disasters. 

Only a life lived 

for others is 

worth living.

In Mewah, we seek to meet the needs of our local 

communities and encourage our employees to

CSR PROGRAM: FUNDRAISING AND DONATION 

TOWARDS 

DOWN 

SYNDROME 

ASSOCIATION 

SINGAPORE (DSA) 

As part of society, everyone has social responsibility 

and everyone must try to act in the best interest of 

the community as a whole. In November 2018, we 

collaborated with DSA Singapore by hosting a “Down 

Syndrome Awareness Program” for our employees in 

order to raise awareness. This was also an opportunity 

to exemplify the abilities of persons with Down 

Syndrome disorder while advocating equal rights for 

them. A total of SGD 6,153.00 was raised during the 

Mewah Giving Week fundraising campaign and these 

were later given to the DSA Singapore.

2018. In conjunction with Holy Ramadhan Month, 

we organized a fundraising and Bubur Lambuk 

distribution 

program. 

The 

program 

provides 

opportunity for the special students to get involved 

in the processing and preparation of Bubur Lambuk 

and to make contribution back to the community. 

We managed to distribute 4,000 cups of Bubur 

Lambuk and funded RM 8,000 to the school.

Greetings from Down Syndrome Association (Singapore) [DSA(S)]!

 

DSA(S), a primarily self-funded Social Service Organisation, has been serving the 

needs of persons with Down syndrome and their families in Singapore since 

1996. Through these years with the support of like-minded corporate such as 

Mewah Group, our efforts have returned with meaningful results whereby the 

community is more willing in accepting individuals with Down syndrome. 

We are encouraged and grateful towards the staff at Mewah Group for their 

fervent and generous support towards DSA(S). Aside from inviting 50 of our 

beneficiaries to A $ingapore Carols, Mewah Group also rallied its staff to 

participate in a fundraiser which raised more than $6000 for DSA(S). The 

contribution will be channelled towards running of the various programmes 

and services offered at DSA(S). In addition, we are appreciative for the 

opportunity to conduct an awareness talk for the staff at Mewah Oils and 

Fats Pte Ltd and Ngo Chew Hong Edible Oil Pte Ltd.  It was a meaningful 

time of sharing and we were heartened by their enthusiastic participation. 

The journey of educating the public is fraught with challenge, but with like-

minded corporate like Mewah Group, we are one step closer to achieving 

our mission to advocate for equal opportunities, quality of life and their 

contribution to society. Thank you, Mewah Group for partnering us to raise 

awareness about Down syndrome and raise funds for our beneficiaries! We 

look forward to another year of meaningful partnership with you in 2019.

specific time period. 

CARBON DIOXIDE EQUIVALENTS 

Carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) provide a universal 

standard of measurement against which the impacts of 

releasing different greenhouse gases can be evaluated. 

EFFLUENTS 

Water discharged from one source into a separate body of 

water, such as the refinery plant process water. 

FRESH FRUIT BUNCH (FFB) 

Fruit bunch that harvested from the oil palm tree. The

the atmosphere and keep the planet warm. The primary 

greenhouse gases in our atmosphere are Carbon 

Dioxide, Methane, Water Vapor, etc.

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 

GHG Emissions is an all-encompassing measurement 

for the carbon footprint and energy efficiency in  

our production.

HIGH CONSERVATION VALUES (HCV)

The concept of High Conservation Value Forests 

(HCVF) was first developed by the Forest Stewardship 

Council (FSC) in 1999 as their ninth principle. The 

FSC defined HCVF as forests of outstanding and 

critical importance due to their environmental, 

socio-economic 

and 

cultural 

biodiversity

landscape value. 

HIGH CARBON STOCK (HCS) 

The high carbon stock (HCS) approach is a methodology 

to avoid deforestation in land development. The 

methodology was initially developed in a partnership 

between Greenpeace, TFT and Golden Agri Resources. 

The approach stratifies the vegetation on area of 

land into different classes using analyses of satellite 

images and field plot measurements. Each vegetation 

class is validated through calibrating it with carbon 

stock estimates in the above-ground tree biomass.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018


ABOUT

THIS REPORT 

SCOPE OF THE REPORT 

We adopted the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 

Standards at core level as our reporting framework 

in year 2018. It focuses on Mewah Group’s 

sustainability strategies and practices, highlighting 

the economic, environmental, and social aspects of 

the Company’s activities and developments.

The report covers all sustainability issues that 

deemed material by Mewah. We have chosen to 

focus our reporting in our downstream operations 

as this is our core business in Malaysia. It provides 

an overview of our approach, priorities and targets, 

as well as a baseline performance review in several 

key areas. This Report supplement our 2018 

annual report that can be found on http://www.

mewahgroup.com/upload/AnnualReports/

The report brings together our sustainability 

initiatives, including current and future direction. 

It is intended to be useful for our stakeholders 

– 

our 

customers, 

employees, 

shareholders, 

communities as well as being a communication tool 

to various interested parties about our approach 

to the social and environmental development.

COMPLETENESS 

This report provides a complete overview of our 

core businesses within the established scope. 

The data in this report covers 1 Jan – 31 Dec 

2018. Where possible, we have sought to include 

historical data as a benchmark. We believe that 

the data presented are a fair representation of 

performance, and have included detailed notes in 

relevant sections to ensure transparency.

ASSURANCE 

This is the second Mewah Group’s Sustainability 

report. We have carried out extensive review with 

both internal and external stakeholders to identify 

gaps since the production of our first Sustainability 

report in Dec 2018. It is the first time where 

materiality assessment have been considered 

and incorporated into our report. The outcome 

from materiality assessment enables us to 

recognize the economic, social and environmental 

issues that shape our business success. Moving 

forward, we will continue to use this report to 

engage our stakeholders and to understand what 

form of assurance they would like to see in our  

subsequent reports.
