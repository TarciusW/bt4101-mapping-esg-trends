BOARD STATEMENT 

The board of directors (the “Board”) of Miyoshi Limited (the “Company” and together with 

its subsidiaries, the “Group”) is pleased to present the fifth sustainability report for the 

Group’s financial year ended 31 August 2021 (“FY2021”). It provides a detailed account of our 

sustainability performance in all our operations. 

 

Our ‘tomorrow-focused’ vision allows us to anticipate and address global trends that impact 

the way we live, work, move and the food we eat. Miyoshi links business opportunities to 

important global trends to create long-term value for our customers, employees, 

shareholders, suppliers and local communities. We understand that everything that we do is 

connected to our stakeholders and environment, and that sustainability is smart business. We 

are putting our best minds and technology to go beyond what is possible. 

 

Sustainability in all forms – economic, environmental, social and governance – is central to 

our strategy. Over 30 years, we strive to continue building a more sustainable and thriving 

Group. The Board, having considered sustainability factors as part of its strategic formulation, 

determined the material economic, environmental, social and governance (“EESG”) factors 

and have overseen the management and monitoring of the material EESG factors. 

 

We expect the business environment to continue to face headwinds amid the weak global 

economic outlook and the evolving COVID-19 pandemic.  Nevertheless, the Group remains 

focused on managing our core business by augmenting our revenue streams and maintaining 

cost discipline through improved operational efficiencies.  Our management team will also 

continue to actively evaluate strategic opportunities to diversify through suitable acquisitions 

and joint ventures that will be accretive to our financial performance in the long run. 

 

We are committed to sustaining our leadership for our stakeholders and look forward to 

keeping them appraised of our progress.

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE 

We approach sustainability by integrating it into our business to deliver long-term 

shareholder value and growth. We believe that a truly sustainable business not only creates 

economic value, but does so in a way that benefits its stakeholders and the environment. 

 

Accountability for the best practices is in the hands of our Sustainability Strategy Committee 

(“SSC”), a group of company executives across various functions. The SSC provides strategic 

direction for managing sustainability-related risks and opportunities, and guides the 

development and improvement of frameworks, policies, guidelines and processes to ensure 

that sustainability factors are effectively managed. The SSC comprise the Chief Executive 

Officer (“CEO”), Group Finance Manager and the respective heads of key departments of our 

business units (collectively, the “Management”).   

 

About our Reporting 

Our sustainability reporting is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative 

(“GRI”) G4: Core Option as it provides a set of an extensive framework that is widely accepted 

as a global standard for sustainability reporting. In defining our reporting content, we applied 

the GRI’s principles for defining report content by considering the Group’s activities, impacts 

and substantive expectations and interests of its stakeholders. We observed a total of four 

principles, including materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability index and 

completeness. 

For reporting quality, we observed the principles of balance, comparability, accuracy, 

timeliness, clarity and reliability. 

The EESG data and information provided have not been verified by an independent third 

party. We have relied on internal data monitoring and verification to ensure accuracy.  

External Charters, Principles or Other Initiatives 

Miyoshi has aligned our operations and business practices with the industry practices and 

standards of International Organization for Standards for ISO9001 and TS16949. 

Member of Industry Associations 

We are a member of the following trade and industry associations:

OUR MATERIALITY ANALYSIS 

Materiality analysis enables Miyoshi to define sustainability factors that are of greatest 

significance to our businesses and stakeholders over the long term. 

The SSC team identified the EESG factors material to the Group based on their knowledge of 

their respective business areas, the challenges faced and the corresponding implications for 

Miyoshi’s businesses and operations. The SSC team also considered the insights they gained 

from their day-to-day engagement with their stakeholders. 

The identification of the material EESG factors were followed by extensive consultation with 

internal stakeholders, including members of the management team, to establish the direction 

for sustainability reporting. The SSC also examined the evaluation criteria applied by the 

relevant sustainability indices and rankings to understand the EESG matters of interest to our 

stakeholders to ensure completeness. We considered the guiding principles from Practice 

Note 7F – Sustainability Reporting Guide contained in the SGX-ST Listing Manual Section B: 

Rules of Catalist.  

Based on the above process, we categorised the identified EESG factors into three groups: 

Highly Material, Material and Important. A summary of these factors, how we create value, 

our goals and how they relate to the GRI’s aspects and boundaries is presented in the 

following chart.

For FY2021, the Company reviewed the material EESG factors identified in the previous 

Sustainability Reports and confirmed that there are no changes to the material EESG factors 

identified for reporting. We will continue to evaluate our material EESG factors on an annual 

basis to ensure that the reported topics remain relevant and material. 

 

Aspect Boundaries 

The aspect boundaries ‘within’ the organisation include all subsidiaries and employees within 

the Group. Associate companies, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) 

or assets classified as held for sale are excluded. 

 

The aspect boundaries ‘outside’ the organisation include customers, suppliers, shareholders, 

investors/analysts, government and regulators and community. 

 

WHAT OUR STAKEHOLDERS ARE TELLING US 

At Miyoshi, we build long-lasting, value-creating partnerships with our stakeholders, who 

include our customers, suppliers, business partners, employees and the communities in which 

we operate. 

We make use of a periodic surveys to gauge customer satisfaction and help our company 

improve its operations. We also compile, evaluate, track and analyse all customer complaints 

that enables us to resolve problems efficiently. 

We seek to ensure that Miyoshi’s suppliers meet environmental, health and safety, labor and 

human rights standards and requirements. We assess and review suppliers’ sustainability 

performance, initiate improvements and provide suppliers with training that builds their 

capacity to ensure that issues are recognised and addressed. 

We contribute to the social and economic progress of the communities in which Miyoshi is 

present, and engage with the local community and unions on an ongoing basis.

OUR MATERIAL EESG FACTORS 

 

ECONOMIC  

We strive to deliver consistent returns for our shareholders and contributing to the local 

economies through job creation and taxes. Our focus is on the financial performance 

indicators.  

 

Economic Performance 

Management have been developing a 

more resilient and diversified revenue 

model, such as recurring rental income and 

revenue from non-core business, such as 

revenue from indoor farming.   

 

Target:  To maintain revenue from non-

core business within the range of 3% to 4% 

for FY2022, and subsequently increasing 

revenue from non-core business to 5% by 

FY2023. 

 

Revenue (% revenue from non-core 

business vs total revenue) 

 

 

 

In FY2021, we achieved 3-4% target for 

revenue from non-core business.  

 

Market Presence 

Management also ensures that the 

management team is drawn from the local 

communities so that it can benefit the local 

communities. 

Diversity 

within 

a 

management team and the inclusion of 

members from the local communities, in 

countries which we have operations, can 

enhance human capital, brings economic 

benefit to the local communities and the 

organisation’s ability to understand local 

needs.  

 

Target:  To maintain the proportion of 

management from local communities 

above 90% for FY2022. 

 

Proportion of management hired from 

local communities 

 

 

 

The above management employees are 

from each of our sub-units in the 

Philippines, Thailand, Huizhou (China), 

Wuxi (China), Malaysia and Singapore. 

 

The management from local communities 

was reduced by 3 employees from 39 in 

FY2020 mainly due to resignation of 

employees 

largely 

from 

our 

Wuxi 

subsidiary. Hence, the target for FY2021 

has not been met. 

 

Procurement Practices 

Miyoshi depends on high-quality, safe, and 

affordable supply of materials to meet the 

demands of our operations and the 

expectations of our customers to deliver 

consistent products. Our sourcing is a 

complex and often decentralised issue.  

 

Our customers are increasingly looking for 

transparency and expecting more from 

how we purchase our materials. The origin 

of the materials is exposed to reputational 

risks and potential disruptions in supply 






 

Miyoshi Limited   Sustainability 2021.  

 

11 

and environmental challenges. Miyoshi 

looks for local sourcing opportunities and 

form relationships with local suppliers, 

from countries in which we operate, for 

our materials.   

 

Target:  To achieve the use of locally-based 

suppliers within 70% of materials for FY 

2022. 

 

 

 

 

Since FY2018, Miyoshi has made progress 

to increase the proportion of materials 

sourced from locally-based suppliers. As 

we value the communities that we operate 

in, we will continue to source our materials 

from local communities.  

 

In FY2021, the Group has not met the 

target as some projects required materials 

sourced from overseas suppliers but the 

Group intends to increase the proportion 

of materials sourced from locally-based 

suppliers as soon as possible. 

 

ENVIRONMENTAL 

We are committed to reduce the environmental impacts of our activities, efficiently utilise 

natural resources and reduce waste. Our focus is on materials, energy, water, sustainable 

packaging and waste.  

 

At Miyoshi, we ensure that the principle of sustainable business is embedded in our activities 

and products. This means protecting the future by making the right choices in an environment 

where water is increasingly scarce, natural resources are constrained and biodiversity is 

declining.  

 

Materials (metals/packaging materials), energy and water are irreplaceable inputs of many of 

our production and consumption processes. Environmental concerns on metal mining include 

physical disturbances to the landscape, soil and water contamination and air contamination. 

Energy sources also have some impact on our environment, including wildlife and habitat loss, 

global warming emissions, air and water pollution. Optimisation of water use by our Group is 

important because it can lower water withdrawals from local water sources thus increasing 

water availability and improving community relations.  

 

Measuring and managing the consumption of the materials, energy and water is not only 

important for our planet and communities in which we operate, it is also essential to the 

sustainability of our business. We are committed to minimising our environmental impact 

across our operations. 

 

 

The Company has adopted electronic communication with shareholders and the Company is 

no longer required to print and deliver physical copies of Annual Report and Circular for 

General Meetings. The objective is to reduce the use of paper and save the environment. In 

FY2021, the Company has saved more papers from printing of notice of Annual General 

Meeting and Extraordinary General Meeting on 30 December 2021 as companies are allowed 

to use electronic means of communication with shareholders and relevant authorities. This is 




 

Miyoshi Limited   Sustainability 2021.  

 

12 

in response to the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Alternative Arrangements for Meetings 

for Companies, Variable Capital Companies, Business Trusts, Unit Trusts and Debenture 

Holders) Order 2020. 

 

Materials and Waste 

Our components manufactured are mainly made of steel, copper and aluminium. For FY2021, 

we bought 70.1% of the materials used locally (i.e., from the country of our operations). We 

work closely with our suppliers to ensure they match our commitment to corporate social 

responsibility.  

 

Steel is a uniquely sustainable material because once it is made, it can be used as steel forever. 

Steel is infinitely recyclable and the material can be used by future generations. Steel is one 

of the most recycled materials in the world. 

 

Steel waste or scrap, such as metal shavings, cut-outs and debris, is nearly inevitable when 

cutting and shaping products. Scrap is also generated when the dimensions of the product 

does not meet stringent quality standards.  

 

Our approach is to minimise quality scrap by keeping our employees trained and motivated. 

We believe our people are still key to our Group’s success. It is our workers who set up, 

operate, and maintain the machinery that we use to meet our production goals. Keeping their 

skills up to date while motivating them to find ways to improve efficiency is a key part of 

minimising scrap. 

 

The other approach is to ensure all the scrap are accounted for and sent to a local steel mill 

for recycling or exported.   

 

Target:  To maintain materials scrap of production volume of 20% in FY2022. 

 

 

 

In FY2021, as materials consumed increased, we did not meet the target of 15% set in FY2021 

partly due to the fire incident reported on 28 May 2020 (the “Fire Incident”) which resulted 

in higher scrap percentage of materials for FY2021 as production only resumed gradually from 

the 1st quarter of FY2021. 

 

 

 

 

 

 






 

Miyoshi Limited   Sustainability 2021.

Energy and Water 

Managing energy and water is important to our bottom line and the environment. Our 

factories require energy to operate and approximately 8,285 megawatt hours (MWh) of 

electricity was consumed in FY2021.  

 

Energy is consumed by our various equipment, lighting systems, cooling/heating and 

ventilation systems. Our approach towards energy is mainly focused on the reduction of 

machine idling time. This idling is due to the metal part queueing for quality check before 

continuing production. Machine idling leads to inefficiency and in turn increases the energy 

consumption per part.  

 

The 

lighting 

systems 

offer 

great 

opportunities for savings. Adopting the 

latest fluorescent and Light Emitting Diode 

(LED) tubes and installing occupancy 

detection system will ensure that only 

occupied areas are lit and light levels 

exactly match what is required by the 

activities in each specific area. No energy is 

wasted on lighting empty areas or 

providing more light than is necessary. An 

example is having the light sensors in our 

toilets.  

 

Water savings are achieved through a 

combination 

of 

changing 

behaviour, 

modifying and replacing equipment with 

water saving equipment to reduce overall 

water consumption and increase internal 

reuse. Trainings are also conducted to raise 

the awareness among employees on 

efficient use of water and responsible use. 

We 

conduct 

regular 

inspections 

of 

equipment or areas where leaks could 

occur, such as piping joints, connections 

and fittings.  

 

 

Target:   To reduce up to 5% of energy and water consumption from previous year.  

 

In FY2021, the Group has achieved the target of reducing up to 5% energy and water 

consumption from previous year.

Sustainable Packaging 

One of the most overlooked sources of waste in the supply chain is packaging waste. 

Recognising that one-way packaging supply chains result in an unacceptable amount of waste, 

Miyoshi has initiated a Returnable Packaging program at our manufacturing sites in the 

Philippines, Thailand and China.  

 

The economics of sustainable packaging is clear as reducing packaging waste creates 

efficiencies and lowers costs of production. Re-using materials extend their life and helps to 

use less of the earth’s precious resources. Recycling allows us to repurpose valuable materials 

that would otherwise have been wasted. The more we reduce, re-use and recycle, the greater 

the cost savings in packaging materials, transport and disposal.  

 

In Miyoshi, we use cardboard boxes (recyclable) and plastic crates (reusable and recyclable) 

in our packaging and they are usually placed on wooden and plastic pallets (recyclable and 

reusable).  

 

Target:   To increase the use of recyclable or reusable packaging materials.  

 

The Group has not collected the information on the usage of recyclable or reusable packing 

materials for FY2021 as the total costs of packaging material over the Group’s revenue is only 

approximately S$0.8 million or 1.4%. However, we will be working to collect the data and 

report in FY 2022.  

 

Our Material EESG Factors 

 

SOCIAL IMPACT AND PERFORMANCE 

Miyoshi defines social sustainability as 

caring about and investing in the needs of 

our employees and communities over the 

long 

term. 

We 

partner 

with 

our 

stakeholders in the pursuit of positive 

societal change, ensuring all parties 

operate with integrity and an ethical 

mindset. 

In 

doing 

so, 

we 

share 

responsibilities for delivering results the 

right way. We strive to engage our 

employees and improve the quality of life 

in the communities where we do business. 

 

Human Capital 

At Miyoshi, we understand that our people 

make us what we are. We strive to hire the 

best candidates and retain employees 

around the region. We aim to motivate all 

our employees within a high performing 

culture, 

with 

lifelong 

learning 

and 

development possibilities. We seek to 

create a respectful, inclusive and diverse 

workplace. At Miyoshi, we believe that 

talent 

and 

effort 

should 

drive 

advancement. Everyone should be treated 

fairly regardless of their ethnicity, gender, 

age or disability. We aim to create an 

environment where all people are treated 

with respect and valued for their individual 

strengths. 

 

Globalisation, demographic change and 

technology are changing the world of 

work. This creates opportunities, but also 

presents challenges – especially for those 

accustomed to earlier models of workplace 

organization. Constant connectivity and 

the intensification of work threaten to blur 

the boundaries between work and private 

life. 

 

Talent Acquisition 

Our employees make Miyoshi what it is. 

We need to attract, develop and retain 

top-notch people to be successful. Our

talent acquisition efforts are geared 

towards finding the best individuals, 

wherever they may be. Our development 

and retention programs help employees 

reach their personal goals as they 

contribute to making Miyoshi the best 

company it can be. 

 

As at 31 August 2021, we employed 811 

employees within Asia, an increase of 

approximately 

15 

employees 

in 

comparison to 31 August 2020. Thereof, 

58% were in the Philippines, 21% in the 

People’s Republic of China, 14% in Thailand 

and the remaining 7% from Malaysia and 

Singapore. More than 72% of our 

employees have a permanent contract, a 

slight decrease from 77.6% a year ago. The 

use of temporary workers enhances labour 

flexibility and allow us to cater to 

fluctuating demand of our businesses. 

 

To maintain a high-quality workforce, we 

have taken several initiatives, including 

using recruiters for recruitment as they

Learning and Development 

Having the right people with the right skills 

in the right places at the right time is 

essential to our success as a Group. 

 

Miyoshi 

advocates 

development 

opportunities that allow employees to 

achieve 

their 

full 

potential. 

The 

management, comprising the head of sub-

units and heads of departments, meets to 

identify 

and 

manage 

learning 

and 

developmental needs, career planning and 

human 

resource 

concerns. 

Suitable 

training is extended to employees to 

enable them to perform at optimal levels. 

Such training comprises mainly on-the-job 

training 

and 

mentoring, 

classroom 

training, 

job 

rotation 

and 

courses 

conducted by external trainers.  

 

Employee Retention 

Miyoshi supports paying employees a 

competitive wage. Consistent with our 

principle of valuing personal contribution 

and mastery, we provide employees the 

opportunity to develop their skills and 

capabilities to enhance their ability to 

succeed in their career, consistent with the 

needs of the business.  

 

Our 

employee 

benefits 

have 

been 

developed to protect the financial security 

of employees. These benefits include 

comprehensive coverage for health care, 

vacation and holiday time, and other 

work/family benefits, including flexitime 

and child care leave. 

 

The average tenure of our employees is 

about 6.9 years and more than 50.9% of 

our employees have been with Miyoshi for 

more than five years. Miyoshi’s attrition 

rate is 17.6% in FY 2021, a decrease from 

35.9% a year ago.  A minimum of one 

month’s notice is required for any 

employee resignation. 

 

Target:  To maintain attrition rate of less 

than 25% in FY2022. 

 

The lower attrition rate in FY2021 was 

mainly due to gradual recovery of business 

activities.  

 

In FY2021, the Group has achieved target 

attrition rate of less than 25%.

people 

with 

different 

experiences, 

backgrounds, skills, we are better able to 

meet a wide range of challenges and 

encourage innovation. Our employees 

need to reflect the diverse markets and 

customers we serve. We aim to strengthen 

our Group by recruiting different kinds of 

people who can help create value in 

unique ways for our Group, our customers 

and partners, and society at large.  

 

At the core of our strategy, we want to 

foster a culture of inclusion so that 

everyone is valued, included and performs 

at their peak.  

 

Foundational 

diversity 

and 

inclusion 

capability focuses on key concepts such as 

microinequities, unconscious bias, benefits 

in leveraging diversity and intent versus 

impact on others. By understanding these 

types of differences, it enables our 

employees to be in touch and build 

collaborative diverse relationships so that 

we can all successfully grow our business 

together. 

 

Our diversity strategy is facilitated by our 

geographical reach, and we employ 

individuals from 8 countries. Beyond that, 

we have taken steps to promote and 

strengthen the diversity of our workforce: 

 

- 

Addressing unconscious bias; 

- 

Promoting gender balance; 

- 

Supporting people with disabilities; 

- 

Ensuring an inclusive culture that 

values 

the 

contributions 

of 

different people from diverse 

backgrounds. 

 

The proportion of women as a percentage 

of the total workforce increased slightly to 

49.6% as at 31 August 2021, compared to 

49.2% a year ago.  

 

The median age in the year under review 

was 42, compared to 42 a year ago. 

Diversity has become a key element of our 

hiring, regional placement and promotion 

processes. We are taking strides to ensure 

diversity in the candidate pools for top 

positions as well as on the teams that make 

decisions related to hiring and promotions. 

Among the new hires in FY2021, 51.3% 

were women, compared to 48.4% in 

FY2020. 

 

 

Among the 119 new hires, 49.0% were 

under 30 years old, 50.3% between 30 and 

50 years old and 0.7% over 50 years old.  

 

Target:  To develop an inclusive culture 

and respecting the contribution of all 

employees regardless of gender, age, race 

or disability.

Workplace safety, health and well-being 

Creating and sustaining a safety-focused, zero-incident culture is a top priority for everyone 

at Miyoshi. This commitment starts with our CEO and permeates the entire organisation. At 

Miyoshi, everyone is responsible for their own safety and the safety of their co-workers’ 

safety. We promote open discussions with Management regarding work-related hazards and 

safety issues. Our manufacturing sites conduct monthly environmental, health and safety 








 

Miyoshi Limited   Sustainability 2021.  

 

19 

(EHS) meetings. These meetings raise awareness of safety compliance issues and provide our 

employees with opportunities to share best practices. 

 

At Miyoshi, we support our employees to live healthy lives and achieve peak performance. 

We emphasise on nutrition, fitness, easy access to our health information and an 

environment that encourages healthy choices and personal management of health risks. 

In our manufacturing sites, we work with our canteen operators to provide meals based on 

healthier cooking methods, such as ovens and grilling, instead of frying and to include more 

fibre in their diet, such as fruits and vegetables. 

 

During FY2021, the Group has implemented Safe Management Measures in respect of the 

safety measures requirements to curb the spread of COVID-19. This includes the use of virtual 

meetings, remote work arrangement and dissemination of materials and articles from local 

authorities on health measures related to COVID-19 to our employees.  

 

 

 

Target:  To have zero work-related fatality and minimise the number of lost days due to 

injuries. 

 

In FY2021, the Group has met its targets as there were no work-related fatality and reduced 

number of lost days by 45% compared to previous year. 

 

Incident Investigations 

In our drive to constantly improve our safety performance and share lessons learned, we are 

constantly strengthening our incident investigation capabilities through training and support. 

Training sessions helps systematically analyse the root causes of incidents and address 

measures preventing recurrence have been conducted in the Philippines, Thailand, China and 

Malaysia. The Management and all employees have been alerted to the importance of 

workplace safety and everyone plays a crucial part in preventing accidents from happening.    

 

Suppliers and Contractors 

Suppliers and contractors are essential to our operations, especially in the core business. 

Therefore, we must make the safety performance of contractors and suppliers a central 

concern. The selection process for suppliers and contractors, especially for high-risk activities 

(such as electrical works or working at heights), includes the mandatory participation of safety 

experts. Additionally, we also train the employees of suppliers and contractors in our practical 

safety training courses at our various manufacturing locations. 

 

Anti-Child Labour and Anti-Forced Labour 

Miyoshi is against any form of coerced labour and discrimination, and adheres to the tenets 

of global human rights conventions that include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 

and the International Labour Organisation (“ILO”) Conventions. We comply with the five key 

principles of fair employment:
