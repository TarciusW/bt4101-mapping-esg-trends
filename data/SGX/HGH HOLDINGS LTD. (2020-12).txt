BOARD'S STATEMENT  

 

The Board of Directors (the “Board” or "Directors") of HGH Holdings Ltd. (formerly known as AA Group 

Holdings Ltd.) (the “Company” and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) reaffirm our commitment 

to sustainability with the publication of our sustainability report for the financial year ended 31 December 

2020 ("Report"), highlighting the Group’s environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) initiatives.  

 

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the necessary precautions that have been taken to contain 

its spread have led to business disruptions, and thus economic slowdown, around the world.  

 

With the gradual reopening of the global economy, we remain vigilant about operating safely in this new 

normal. This goes beyond restarting business to include seizing opportunities that may arise in this new 

environment to catalyse change internally and holistically. 

 

The Group is committed to upholding good corporate governance practices, enhancing operational safety 

and promoting environmental sustainability. We have and will consider these sustainability issues as part 

of our strategic formulation for the Group, and will continue to oversee the management and monitoring 

of our ESG performance and initiatives. We will continue to take a phased approach to progress along our 

sustainability journey as we grow our business. We look forward to progressively enhance our 

sustainability performance to strengthen the growth of our business in the long-term. 

 

 

For and on behalf of  

the Board of Directors of  

HGH Holdings Ltd.

ABOUT THE GROUP  

Our Business 

The Group was listed on the Catalist Board of the Singapore Exchange Securities in 2005. In 2017, the 

Group underwent a transformation as it ventured into new businesses namely leasing of property and 

provision of property related services, supply and manufacturing of ready-mix concrete, precast 

component and related products and supply of precast concrete products. In 2018, the Group completed 

its divestment of its initial business in manufacturing and supplying of high-precision cold forged 

loudspeaker parts and had successfully acquired PHH, whose main business is in the provision of 

underground cable installation and road reinstatement services.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

The Group conducted our first materiality assessment in 2017 to identify and prioritise relevant 

sustainability topics. Facilitated by an independent sustainability consultant, this assessment involves the 

management, key representatives from the Company’s various business units as well as internal and 

external stakeholders. Material topics have been identified based on both risks and opportunities arising 

from our business activities, the environmental, social and governance impacts that are most significant 

to our stakeholders, as well as with reference to our current risk management framework.  

 

This year, we reviewed and revalidated the existing material ESG topics, and determined that they remain 

relevant in 2020.  

The matrix below depicts the material topics that are of importance to our stakeholders in 2020: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Step 1:



Identification

Issues were identified by

stakeholders

and

a

discussion

was

held to

obtain

views

on

these

issues. After consolidating

feedbacks, a list of key

issues were crafted.

Step 2:



Prioritisation

Key issues were reviewed

by

key

representatives

and management and this

allowed us to prioritise

issues

based

on

the

impact to our business.

The level of priority was

ranked from low to high.

Step 3:



Validation

A materiality matrix was

plotted, which was then

revalidated

by

the

management

and

the

Board.

The materiality assessment took into account the GRI guidelines, and the material topics that are 

significant to the Group's operations in Singapore and Malaysia are presented below. We have gathered 

feedback from various stakeholders across our entire value chain who are influenced by, and can 

significantly influence, the Group’s businesses and operations. By identifying material topics that have 

both positive and negative impact on stakeholders, we ensure that both risks and opportunities are taken 

into account in our strategic and business planning. 

Reporting Framework and List of Material Topics 

For each material topic, we report on its relevance to our business and stakeholders. 

 

The following sections in this Report evaluate these material topics taking into consideration the changing 

business landscape and our business direction. We will strengthen our existing sustainability framework, 

set targets for improvement and aim to reach these targets in the subsequent years. 

We look forward to further engage with our stakeholders. The perspectives of our stakeholders will help 

us evaluate and fine-tune our approach to better manage our business in a sustainable way.

GOVERNANCE  

We believe that having the right business values – good corporate governance and ethical conduct is 

crucial to the Group's growth and provides a robust foundation to the Group. The Group is committed to 

conduct our business in an ethical and responsible manner, and we do not tolerate any corruption or 

bribery within any of our businesses. 

 

Corporate Governance 

The Group understands the importance of good corporate governance, accountability and transparency 

and is committed to uphold high standards of governance and regulatory compliance. In FY2020, the 

Group ensured compliance with the Code of Corporate Governance 2018 as required under the Catalist 

Rules.  

 

Please refer to pages 12 to 41 of our Annual Report 2020 for further details of our Corporate Governance 

practices and compliance with the Code of Corporate Governance 2018.  

 

The Group has a dynamic team in place to implement and execute sustainable strategies across the 

organisation. The Sustainability Committee ensures all strategies, policies and practices have been 

incorporated to strengthen its sustainability performance and reports to the Board on all sustainability 

matters.  

 

The Board oversees the Sustainability Committee and ensures that all material factors identified are well-

managed and monitored to ensure transparency and accountability towards the Group.

Compliance 

The Group conducts its businesses in an honest and ethical manner and is committed to act professionally 

and fairly in all business dealings. 

 

The Board meets on a regular basis to ensure that the Group meets all regulatory requirements and 

ensures compliance with all relevant laws and regulations in countries we operate in. Similarly, the Board 

will also manage the Sustainability Committee to ensure that the Group is in compliance with the relevant 

rules and regulations and adheres to the policies and procedures that have been set out by the 

management and the Board. 

We have been actively engaging our continuing sponsor and we remain compliant with all reporting 

requirements under the Catalist Rules as well as other applicable rules and regulations in Singapore. There 

were no non-compliance cases recorded during the reporting year of 2020. Since there was no record of 

non-compliance, the Board believes that the Group's compliance controls remain appropriate and we 

strive to work closely with our continuing sponsor to maintain zero incident of non-compliance record in 

the subsequent years. 

 

Whistleblowing 

The Group has had a robust whistle-blowing policy in place since 2008 and it has been updated from time 

to time in order to stay relevant, with the latest review in FY2020. The updated policies and procedures 

for raising any concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or management 

were communicated to all employees of the Group via email on 1 January 2020. This will also be 

communicated to all new employees of the Group during the orientation for new employees. 

 

The policy applies to all employees within the Group and any third parties dealing with the Group, and 

provides a mechanism for employees and external parties to report concerns over alleged wrongful acts. 

Employees or external parties with complaints, concerns or issues relating to potential corrupt activities, 

are able to raise their concerns, in confidence, to the Chairman of the Audit Committee, Ms. Amelia 

Vincent, or the Independent Director, Mr Andrew Bek. This is also addressed on page 34 of our Annual 

Report 2020.  

 

There have been no reported incidents of corruption in the Group during the period and we will continue 

to monitor and prevent its occurrence. We will also continue to ensure that all employees are fully aware 

of our policies and sign our anti-corruption declaration form.  

 


 

 

11 

 

SOCIAL 

Employment Practices 

We practice fair employment and provide equal opportunities to all employees, regardless of their race, 

religion, age, gender or background. The Group’s recruitment of employees and their subsequent annual 

appraisal are based on merit, work attitude, cooperation with other staff and their efficiency and 

effectiveness of work. We believe that promoting a fair workplace environment will build the employees’ 

respect and loyalty towards the Company.  

 

We are fully compliant with the Singapore Government’s Employment Practices listed under the Ministry 

of Manpower to ensure that we remain competitive against similar industry players. Furthermore, the 

Group does not discriminate according to race, age, gender, religion, ethnicity, facial attractiveness, 

physical impairments, sexual preference, political viewpoints or nationality. 

 

The Human Resource Policies and Procedures (“HRPP”) formulated by the Human Resource team have 

been updated from time to time and applied across all business units to ensure consistency of internal 

practices among all business units. The HRPP documents the employee's benefits and governs our non-

discriminatory hiring policies and merit-based promotion policies. Fair and non-discriminatory 

employment policies are put in place to attract and retain talent. 

 

➢ Valuing our employees 

The Group prioritises job satisfaction and welfare as one of its top priorities. We recognise long-serving 

employees with cash awards and the contributions made by our employees with various incentives to 

show our appreciation. Our employees are entitled to a range of benefits including healthcare, insurance 

and parental leave. Further, the Group offers competitive pay packages that are benchmarked to the 

market and rewards each employee based on their competency and performance. Our retention rates, 

as per the chart below:

As part of our continued efforts toward providing transparent and merit-based compensation package, 

the remuneration breakdown of our Directors and our key management personnel can be found on page 

28 of our Annual Report 2020.  

 

The Company and its subsidiaries will continue to abide to the local labour laws in Singapore to promote 

fair employment practices. In FY2020, the Group has adhered to all relevant labour laws and there were 

no records of complaints from staff or of non-compliance from the authorities as targeted in the previous 

sustainability report (FY2019: Nil). We target to maintain the current status of adherence to all relevant 

labour laws and zero records of complaints from staff or of non-compliance from the authorities, in 

FY2021. 

 

Training and development 

We ensure that our employees have access to a fair, collaborative and engaging workplace which allows 

them to provide their perspectives and concerns on the issues. To ensure that our staff stay abreast of 

the updated skills or information, we provide regular training opportunities for staff to equip themselves 

with the required skill sets. In the upcoming years, we target to increase the frequency in which our 

workers attend courses and trainings, in particular for courses and trainings in relation to safety work 

practices. 

 

Some of the courses attended by the employees are workplace safety and health, plumbing and 

pipefitting tradesman continual education training, construction safety orientation, ISO 9001:2017 

Awareness and Quality Audit, WSQ – operate forklift/lorry crane/excavator, supervisor safe lifting 

operations, perform rigger &amp; signalman tasks, first aid, traffic control course and basic concept in 

construction. 

 

In FY2020, employees attended courses and trainings amounting to 832 training hours as compared to 

488.7 training hours in FY2019. The training covers the necessary technical and soft skill sets, as well as 

on-the-job training. The substantial increase of training hours in FY2020 is due to the provision of basic 

trainings (i.e. concept in construction) to new hires.   

 


 

 

13 

 

 

 

 

In FY2021, we will continue to deploy our resources and offer training courses to our employees to 

enhance their professional competence. 

 

Workforce Diversity 

The Group believes in the importance of diversity that it drives innovation and increases competitive 

advantage in our organization. Our employees come from all walks of life. 

 

In FY2020, our workforce consisted of 83 employees, including 79 male employees and 4 female 

employees, as shown in the charts below. The decrease in the number of total employees was due to the 

COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the operation of PC. In addition, expiry of foreign workers permits 

and contracts in PHH has contributed to the decrease. Our workforce has a higher number of male 

employees due to the nature of our business operations. 

 

Total number of employees and the workforce diversity for FY2020 is as follows:

Total number of employees and the workforce diversity for FY2019 is as follows: 

 

 

 

 

As at 31 December 2020, we have 5 directors on the Board; 4 male Directors and 1 female Director and 

they are individuals who have diverse qualifications and work experience. For more details on the 

qualification and work experience of each Director, please refer to Board of Directors on pages 8 and 9 of 

our Annual Report 2020.  

 

In FY2020, there were a total of 11 new male hires and 43 male job leavers across all business units, as 

shown in the chart below. Our turnover rate for the year averages at 30% largely due to the impact of 

COVID-19 which has severely affected the business operation in PC as well as the expiry of work permits 

for foreign workers in PHH. To address this issue, employees are encouraged to provide feedback to their 

reporting manager. There are also cohesive activities (such as team lunches, special occasion 

celebrations) in place for team bonding.

Occupational Health and Safety 

The well-being and safety of our employees and relevant stakeholders are of utmost importance to us. 

To ensure a safe working environment, our employees and relevant stakeholders are expected to observe 

and follow safety procedures at all times.  

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group has deepened our focus on occupational health and 

safety. To ensure a safe working environment, the Group has established dedicated task forces in 

Singapore to develop health and safety measures in accordance with evolving local directives and best 

practices.  

Some examples of these newly instituted measures include mandating the wearing of protective masks 

and other protective equipment in the workplace at all times, observance of safe distancing measures 

and adherence to medical testing and quarantine directives if an employee has travelled to medium- or 

high-risk areas or is suspected of contracting COVID-19. Office premises and sites are also disinfected 

regularly and adequate ventilation is ensured. In addition, physical meetings have been minimised, with 

virtual meetings becoming the default mode of communication. 

In addition to the new COVID-19 containment measures, the Group continues to maintain our Safety 

Management System, across our business operations in implementing occupational health and safety 

measures.  

Safety briefing by the project lead will be held before the commencement of each project. All safe work 

practices manual will be reviewed regularly by the top management, taking into account the feedback we 

received from the ground staff, to ensure effectiveness in work processes.

The management sends the employees for safety training courses conducted by the Singapore Workforce 

Skills and Qualifications, to keep them updated on the safety procedures. The management also sends 

the employees to attend occupational first aid courses, as well as refresher courses as and when needed 

to maintain the validity of their first aid certificates. 

In FY2020, the Group has adhered to all the laws and regulations in place which can be supported by zero 

incidents of non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary codes concerning the health and safety 

impacts of products and services. We target to maintain the same performance for FY2021. 

Customer Satisfaction 

Our businesses thrive on mutually beneficial and strong relationships formed with our customers. We 

always emphasize the importance of providing good customer service to all our employees. Feedback 

from customers is reviewed and relevant follow-up actions are performed in a timely manner. Good 

relationships with our customers and positive feedback from our customers motivate us as a Group to 

continue delivering a high standard of service quality and work across all our operations. 

For FY2020 (FY2019: Nil complaints), the Group did not receive any official complaints from our 

customers. We target to maintain this good track record of zero customer complaints for FY2021.

ENVIRONMENTAL 

There is an increasing awareness to environmental issues such as climate change. The Group believes that 

environmentally friendly practices complement business efficiency and advocates corporate social 

responsibility towards the environment by incorporating these processes in its daily operations. As a 

socially responsible corporation, the Group strictly complies with related environmental regulations and 

all employees share responsibilities in monitoring the Group’s environmental performances. In FY2020, 

there were zero incidents of non-compliance with relevant material environmental laws and regulations. 

We aim to maintain this trend in FY2021.

➢  Energy and water efficiency 

As part of our continuing initiative, we do have stringent controls such as prompt reporting of faulty 

equipment that may result in excess waste, water or electricity consumption. Employees and relevant 

stakeholders are also reminded of the importance to save water in their daily activities and to reduce 

water usage.   

 

We monitor energy usage at the construction sites for all our projects to ensure that they are maintained 

at consistent levels, and any abnormality is immediately investigated and rectified. In addition to reducing 

energy consumption in relation to construction activities, we also implement various measures to 

minimize energy consumption in our head office building. Employees and relevant stakeholders are 

reminded regularly to switch off all lights, air conditioners and equipment when they leave the office or 

when equipment is not in use. Air conditioners within the head office buildings are serviced regularly, and 

rundown Fan Coil Units (FCUs) are replaced to maintain high efficiency.  

 

As part of our initiatives, energy saving LED lights were installed around our premises. Subsequently, we 

are looking to progressively install energy saving LED lights for all office units on our premises. We may 

also consider energy efficient equipment when purchasing new office equipment in the future.

Effluents and Waste 

We continuously strive to reduce waste from operations by encouraging employees and relevant 

stakeholders to re-use and recycle usable material. In addition, we have been enforcing stringent controls 

on the management of waste generated from our operations. These controls include proper segregation 

and disposal of waste. Our waste includes general waste, wood waste and food waste. There is no 

hazardous waste produced. Recycling bins and multiple waste segregation bins are available within our 

premises and are placed at common areas for employees and relevant stakeholders to segregate waste.  

We also engage environmentally responsible service provider to manage the disposal of our waste. All 

waste generated are collected from the site by a licensed waste collector. General and food waste are 

sent to the National Environment Agency (NEA) for waste-to-energy (WTE) incineration and wood waste 

are sent to our service provider's site for recycling purposes. The Group endeavours to manage waste 

sustainably by utilising technologies in the future. 

In FY2020, there were no incidence of non-compliance with laws and regulations resulting in significant 

fines.  We target to maintain the same performance in FY2021. 

 

Supply Chain 

We recognise the importance of sustainable value generation and take into consideration the following 

factors - economic value of products, business ethics and reputation as a few of the criterion when 

assessing and selecting new potential suppliers. We believe that a sustainable supply chain can help us 

conserve resources, optimise processes and increase productivity. 

 

The head of each business unit conducts stringent checks on our current suppliers to ensure they are in 

compliance with local rules and regulations. Similarly, the checks include ethical practices of these 

suppliers while sourcing for raw materials and the degree of impact these processes contribute to the 

environment.  

 

In FY2020, we did not have any reported incident of non-compliance regarding product health and safety, 

environmental and social performance. In FY2021, we aim to maintain the same performance.

Product and Service Quality 

We have a stringent quality assurance system and we have conducted random due diligence checks to 

ensure all our products receive proper certification of compliance. We are committed to ensuring that 

our products are manufactured according to industry standards. PC’s source of materials for the supply 

of ready-mix concrete, precast component and related products are from Building and Construction 

Authority (BCA) registered suppliers in Singapore. 

 

In FY2020, we did not receive any formal complaints about our product or service quality, and we 

endeavour to maintain this clean record in FY2021.
