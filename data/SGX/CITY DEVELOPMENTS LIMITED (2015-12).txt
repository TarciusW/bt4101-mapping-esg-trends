Integrating our Strengths, 

Creating Future Value

At City Developments Limited (CDL), we believe the 

future is ours to build. 

Over the past 20 years, our ethos of ‘Conserving as 

we Construct’ has built a strong Corporate Social 

Responsibility (CSR) foundation.

The sustainability journey of a thousand miles for 

us, began with a single step in 1995. In 2015, 

we challenged ourselves to “Create Future Value” 

for sustainable growth by harnessing our capitals. 

Today, we take a further step in that direction by 

“Integrating our Strengths”, making positive impact 

in the areas most material to our business and 

stakeholders, and staying the course of our Corporate 

Vision to Building Value for Tomorrow, Today.

01




EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN STATEMENT

Dear Stakeholders,

As a pioneering adopter of sustainability since 1995 

with our first dedicated Social and Environment 

Report published in 2008, CDL is fully supportive 

of the Singapore Exchange’s plan to implement the 

“comply or explain” approach towards sustainability 

reporting in 2017. 

Having celebrated two decades of our CSR journey 

in 2015, CDL has stepped up our focus towards 

“Creating Future Value”. In line with this emphasis 

on value creation, we became the first property 

developer in Singapore to adopt the International 

Integrated Reporting Council’s (IIRC) Integrated 

Reporting &lt;IR&gt; approach for our Sustainability 

Report last year.

This Report continues to embrace the IR approach to 

connect CDL’s social and environmental performance 

with business and financial impact for a more 

meaningful and all-rounded corporate reporting. 

Testament to our sustainability efforts, CDL was 

ranked the Top Real Estate Company and Top 10 

in the prestigious Global 100 Most Sustainable 

Corporations in the World in 2016. In 2014 and 

2015, CDL was Asia’s Top Property Developer and 

Top Singapore Company in the Channel NewsAsia 

Sustainability Ranking. The Company also remains 

the first Singapore corporation to be listed on three 

of the world’s leading sustainability benchmarks – 

FTSE4Good Index Series (since 2002), Global 100 

Most Sustainable Corporations in the World  

(since 2010) and Dow Jones Sustainability  

Indices (since 2011).

In 2015, CDL mourned the sudden passing of our 

Deputy Chairman, Mr Kwek Leng Joo, who was also 

Chairman of the CSR &amp; Corporate Governance (CG) 

Committee. A dedicated advocate of CSR for over 

two decades, Mr Kwek’s vision of ‘Conserving as we 

Construct’ established CDL’s reputation as a leading 

green building champion and forerunner in CSR, 

raising the bar for Singapore’s real estate industry 

and driving change for the building sector. His 

pioneering green efforts have helped to place CDL 

and Singapore on the global map of sustainability. 

The Board remains committed to building upon these 

achievements and advancing CDL’s sustainability 

efforts. In February 2016, the Board welcomed  

Mr Eric Chan as Chairman of the CSR &amp; CG 

Committee, in addition to his role as Chairman of the 

Audit &amp; Risk Committee as well as the Remuneration 

Committee. Mr Chan’s expertise and extensive 

experience will no doubt be invaluable as we continue 

to strive forward in our sustainability journey.

Since January 2016, the sustainability function and 

company-wide CSR committee has come under the 

direct supervision of the Chief Executive Officer. 

This demonstrates CDL’s continued leadership 

commitment to sustainable practices and our 

strategic approach to integrating sustainability in all 

aspects of our business and operations.

CEO STATEMENT

Dear Stakeholders,

For several years now, most especially in the wake 

of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, there 

has been a growing recognition that the financial 

system must not only be sound and stable, but also 

sustainable. Specifically, in January 2014 the United 

Nations Environment Programme launched an inquiry 

into policy options for guiding the global financial 

system to invest in the transition to a low-carbon, 

green economy. In response, global sustainable 

investment assets have increased dramatically in 

recent years, rising from US$13.3 trillion at the 

outset of 2012 to a total of US$21.4 trillion at the 

start of 2014. Similarly, in 2015 the Singapore 

Exchange (SGX) recently released its plans and 

proposed guidelines for sustainability reporting on a 

‘comply or explain’ basis from financial year 2017.

2015 was a year marked with significant 

developments in sustainability. The unprecedented 

COP21 Paris agreement in December saw 195 

nations pledge to limit global warming to below 2°C 

by 2100. Singapore also submitted its Intended 

Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), stating 

its intention to reduce its Emissions Intensity by 

36% from 2005 levels by 2030, and stabilise its 

emissions with the aim of peaking around 2030. 

The financial and environmental alignment around 

sustainability issues is expected to increase and 

this will impact policy decisions in the political 

and business arena. As a result, calls for better 

environmental, social, and governance (ESG) targets, 

performance and accountability can be expected to 

increase for all major corporate actors.

Integrating Strengths, Creating Future Value

For over 20 years, CDL’s ethos of ‘Conserving 

as we Construct’ and integrating sustainability 

into our business has been fundamental to our 

corporate strategy. Our commitment to achieving a 

balanced triple bottom line has delivered the right 

mix between financial results, social engagement 

and environmental stewardship. As environmental 

regulations are progressively applied to the property 

sector, our leadership in ESG performance provides a 

clear first-mover advantage. 

Last year, for the first time, CDL adopted the 

International Integrated Reporting Council’s 

(IIRC) Integrated Reporting &lt;IR&gt; approach for our 

Sustainability Report. We are continuing to use this 

framework, by harnessing our six reservoirs of capital – 

financial, organisational, natural, manufactured, social 

and relationship, as well as human – to enhance 

value for our brand, business and stakeholders.

CEO STATEMENT

Driven by our commitment to play 

our part in mitigating the effects of 

climate change, and etched in the firm 

belief that what gets measured gets 

managed, we made yet another bold 

move to become the first developer in 

Singapore to embark on the stringent 

ISO 14064-1 Greenhouse Gas 

verification in March this year.

Financial Capital – Increasing Values through 

Sustained Growth

Despite challenging market conditions both 

domestically and overseas, CDL posted resilient 

earnings of $773.4 million in 2015, comparable to 

the $769.6 million for 2014. 

In light of persistent headwinds in the local market, 

since 2014, CDL has made deliberate efforts to focus 

on our diversification strategy via both geographic 

expansion and development of new investment 

platforms. One of them is to actively grow our funds 

management business. 

In December 2015, CDL unveiled our second Profit 

Participation Securities (PPS 2) programme involving 

a joint investment in a Singapore office portfolio 

comprising three of CDL’s prime office assets. PPS 

2 generated $1.1 billion of incremental cash flow 

and $314 million of incremental profit before tax. 

It enabled CDL to recycle capital for our growth 

plans, rebalances CDL’s office portfolio exposure in 

Singapore, while retaining a substantial investment 

in these prime assets for further capital appreciation. 

To date, CDL has $2.6 billion in funds under 

management through its two PPS vehicles.

Organisational Capital – Instilling Responsible  

Best Practices 

Good corporate governance and risk management 

are key components of our operations and planning 

processes. Where applicable, we strive to align our 

policies and practices with best-in-class standards, 

especially in terms of Environment, Health and 

Safety (EHS). 

We were honoured to be conferred the prestigious 

title of “Best Corporate Governance in the Real 

Estate Developer Sector” at the Ethical Boardroom 

Corporate Governance Awards 2015 and the 

“Most Transparent Company Award 2015” in the 

Real Estate category by the Securities Investors 

Association (Singapore). 

CDL also understands the importance of effective 

risk management and mitigation in realising 

strategic business objectives in today’s increasingly 

dynamic environment. Against the backdrop of 

unprecedented global climate actions and public 

commitments, a review was conducted in 2015 to 

expand our Enterprise Risk Management portfolio to 

include emerging EHS risks material to our business 

operations.

For many years now, CDL has ventured beyond 

practicing to also advocating corporate responsibility 

to our supply chain, tenants, customers, academia, 

and students through thought leadership platforms. 

With more key stakeholders on board in the eco-

system, we believe sustainability goals with the wider 

community can be better achieved. 

 

Natural Capital – Intensifying Efforts in 

Environmental Sustainability 

For the past two decades, we have continuously 

innovated, invested in, and improved on the way 

buildings sustain life. Our pioneering adoption of 

green and low carbon strategies such as maintaining 

our carbon neutral operations in our corporate head 

office, early adoption of extensive solar panels at our 

commercial and residential developments, as well 

as vertical greening have helped to make Singapore 

more sustainable and liveable. 

We have also upheld our unwavering commitment to 

environmental management and energy efficiency. As 

the first private property developer in Singapore to 

achieve the ISO 14001 Environmental Management 

System and ISO 50001 Energy Management System 

certifications since 2003 and 2014 respectively, 

we continue our efforts to overcome inherent 

environmental challenges today and tomorrow. 

04


Driven by our commitment to play our part in 

mitigating the effects of climate change, and etched 

in the firm belief that what gets measured gets 

managed, we made yet another bold move to become 

the first developer in Singapore to embark on the 

stringent ISO 14064-1 Greenhouse Gas verification 

in March this year.

In addition to the carbon intensity reduction targets 

established in 2011, we also further introduced 

electricity and water intensity targets in 2015 – to 

achieve a reduction of 22% by 2020 and 25% by 

2030 from baseline year 2007, across CDL’s core 

business. 

To reinforce our efforts in helping Singapore achieve its 

INDC, CDL is also reviewing our carbon emission targets 

based on the Sectoral Decarbonisation Approach.

Manufactured Capital – Innovating for Smart  

Green Spaces 

We invest between 2% and 5% of a new 

development’s construction cost on green building 

design and features and deliver on quality eco-

spaces. Today, we continue to be the private 

developer with the largest portfolio of Building and 

Construction Authority (BCA) Green Mark buildings 

and office interiors in Singapore – over 801, including 

33 Platinum projects.

At our latest project, The Brownstone Executive 

Condominium (EC), we are adopting the use 

of the innovative Prefabricated Prefinished 

Volumetric Construction (PPVC) technology. 

This PPVC application is the first in Asia and 

also we understand the world’s largest for a 

major residential development. The Brownstone 

emerged as the best-selling EC in 2015 at the 

time of its launch in July 2015, a testament to the 

marketability of our green developments.

In Singapore, buildings account for about 39% of 

energy consumption and users can certainly make 

a difference in conserving energy. With active 

engagement to raise eco-consciousness, over 90% of 

our existing commercial tenants have signed the CDL 

Green Lease Memorandum of Understanding as at 

March 2016.

Social and Relationship Capital – Inspiring 

Stakeholders to Build a Sustainable Future

In this year’s report, we have aligned our material 

issues with the Sustainable Development Goals 

(SDGs) launched by the UN in September 2015. 

This allows us to further pave the way in sustainable 

development through innovative business approaches 

and partnerships in finding solutions for the world’s 

economic, social, and environmental challenges.

As a longstanding advocate of the Government’s 

3P model which encourages partnerships between 

the People, Private, and Public sectors, we are 

committed to sustaining established partnerships and 

forging new collaborations to create a positive impact 

on the community. 

In December 2015, CDL partnered Eco-Business to 

launch a new initiative – EcoBank, to promote waste 

reduction and sustainable consumption. With the 

support of our tenants and shoppers at City Square 

Mall and at six of our commercial properties, over 

6,000kg of “pre-loved” (i.e. second-hand) items 

were collected and sold through a weekend bazaar, 

raising nearly $48,0002 for disadvantaged women 

and children. CDL employees and partners also 

contributed over 500 volunteer hours to help realise 

this meaningful initiative.

1 Includes subsidiaries and associated companies.

2 Includes dollar-to-dollar matching by the Government under the Care and Share @ SG50 Movement.

In this year’s report, we have aligned 

our material issues with the Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs) launched 

by the UN in September 2015. This 

allows us to further pave the way in 

sustainable development through 

innovative business approaches and 

partnerships in finding solutions for 

the world’s economic, social, and 

environmental challenges.

CEO STATEMENT

Celebrating the successful inscription of the 

Singapore Botanic Gardens as Singapore’s first 

UNESCO World Heritage Site, CDL organised a 

charity gala dinner to raise some S$350,000 for 

the Garden City Fund in support of its outreach and 

conservation efforts. As a personal contribution, our 

late Deputy Chairman Mr Kwek Leng Joo launched a 

special photo book titled “Embrace”, capturing the 

natural and cultural beauty of the Gardens. Sale of 

20 copies of the book autographed by Prime Minister 

Lee Hsien Loong raised S$320,0003 for the National 

Heritage Board’s National Monuments Fund.

Youth engagement also remains a key focus with our 

signature outreach programmes such as the annual 

CDL-Compact Singapore Young CSR Leaders Award 

and CDL E-Generation Challenge growing year-

on-year. Through our sustained partnerships with 

educational institutions and creation of knowledge 

sharing platforms, CDL hopes to cultivate a strong 

sense of social and environmental responsibility in 

our youth – our future leaders. 

Human Capital – Investing in our People

At CDL, we see human capital as one of the 

Company’s most valuable resources. We are 

committed to being an employer of choice through 

competitive remuneration, as well as by developing, 

engaging, and caring for our people. In 2015, we 

were awarded with the Singapore Best Companies To 

Work For 2015 – Watch Out World! (W.O.W) Special 

Mention Award presented by Great Place To Work® in 

Singapore for our progressive workplace culture and 

good people practices. 

Biennial Employee Engagement Surveys are also 

conducted to obtain feedback and insights into 

employee-related concerns. For the 2015 Employee 

Engagement Survey, our Employee Engagement 

score was above the Singapore country norm. Our 

employee turnover rate remains well below the 

national average, and we continue to nurture a robust 

talent pool of high-potential employees as part of our 

succession planning efforts. In 2015, we introduced 

the CDL Leadership Programme to sharpen their 

leadership and management skills.

We have also reviewed our remuneration practices 

to align appropriate ESG issues with executive 

management goals and incentive schemes. As a 

result, an ESG-linked appraisal and remuneration 

policy was introduced in 2015 which incorporated 

ESG goals in the setting of individual KPIs for all 

employees, including Senior Management. 

Challenges and Opportunities

The domestic and international economy is expected 

to remain soft in 2016, challenging businesses 

across many sectors. Fears of a global recession, 

stock market volatility, a dramatic fall in oil prices, 

and other uncertainties, have all made the global 

economic climate highly sensitive, and an air of 

caution prevails. 

Locally, the effects of oversupply, higher land and 

construction costs, and property cooling measures, 

have led to a softening of the property market, 

dampening both demand and prices, with little 

impetus for investors. According to the 2016 Budget, 

cooling measures are also not expected to be relaxed 

in the short-term.

Amid the looming threat of the Zika virus, the 

government has also warned that Singapore could 

experience its worst dengue spell in 2016. This is a 

significant risk to our business as construction sites 

are known to have a high potential for mosquito 

breeding. While our established EHS practices have 

helped mitigate such risks to a large extent, we 

will remain vigilant and continue to step up on our 

engagement with contractors.

06


Innovation will continue to be the 

key driver for green and sustainable 

developments. In March this year, 

we announced a partnership with the 

National University of Singapore (NUS) 

to catalyse innovations in smart, green 

building technologies, which could be 

pilot tested in our future developments. 

CDL made a gift of $2.25 million 

to the NUS School of Design and 

Environment to establish two new 

research laboratories – NUS-CDL Smart 

Green Home and NUS-CDL Tropical 

Technologies Laboratory (T² Lab).

The Journey Ahead

As a listed company, strong endorsements of our 

sustainability performance by global sustainability 

benchmarks such as FTSE4Good, Global 100 Most 

Sustainable Corporations in the World, Dow Jones 

Sustainability Indices, GRESB, and CDP continue to 

build trust with international investors, in particular 

Socially Responsible Investing funds. 

Innovation will continue to be the key driver for

a gift of $2.25 million to the NUS School of Design 

and Environment to establish two new research 

laboratories – NUS-CDL Smart Green Home and

These two laboratories are first-of-their-kind tailored 

to the tropical climate, and in line with Singapore’s 

vision to become a cleaner, greener, smarter, and 

more sustainable city.

As we expand our business and investments, we 

are mindful that in the near future, businesses will 

likely be held accountable for their carbon footprint 

and will have to take into consideration possible 

carbon pricing. As such, in managing our day-to-

day business, we remain committed to low carbon 

operations, evident from our newly-set targets for 

electricity and water intensity, and our review of our 

carbon emission goals. We remain steadfast in ESG 

tracking and disclosure for continuous improvement. 

In the long run, superior ESG performance will not 

only enhance a company’s reputation, but also assist 

in risk mitigation and cost management, create 

greater sales volume, and drive improved operational 

performance– ultimately contributing to a growing 

bottom line and the long-term health of the business.

STRATEGY FOR VALUE 

CREATION


INTEGRATED STRATEGY FOR VALUE CREATION

STRATEGIC APPROACH FOR SUSTAINABILITY

At CDL, we continue to refine our management 

approach to adapt to the changing business 

and sustainability landscape. Aligning with 

the perspective of our stakeholders, the Senior 

Management Team (SMT) has, within the scope 

of CDL’s corporate operations, identified that the 

Environment, Employee Relations, Corporate 

Governance (CG) and Risk Management, 

Stakeholder Relations and Community constitute key 

sustainability aspects material to our business. 

A company-wide CSR Committee was set up 

in 2008 and is responsible for driving CSR 

strategically across the business, and measuring 

key performance. This Committee cuts across all 

corporate and operational units that are material 

to the business. It initiates, drives, and monitors 

various aspects of our sustainability practices, 

ensuring that these are integrated into our business 

operations and complement corporate objectives. 

Above this Committee, at the Board Level, is a 

CSR &amp; CG Committee that assumes an advisory 

role for the Company’s sustainability strategy. The 

Committee meets at least once a year to review 

CDL’s sustainability performance.

Following the passing of Mr Kwek Leng Joo, who 

was Deputy Chairman of CDL and Chairman of the 

CSR &amp; CG Committee, the Board has appointed 

Non-Executive and Lead Independent Director Mr 

Chan Soon Hee Eric as Chairman of the Committee. 

The Committee also comprises two other 

independent directors, Mr Yeo Liat Kok Philip and 

Mr Tan Poay Seng. 

With effect from January 2016, the sustainability 

function and company-wide CSR committee comes 

under the direct supervision of the Chief Executive 

Officer. This demonstrates CDL’s continued 

leadership commitment to sustainable practices and 

our strategic approach to integrating sustainability 

across all aspects of our business and operations.

INTEGRATED STRATEGY FOR VALUE CREATION

STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT OF  

MATERIAL ISSUES

Materiality is any factor that can have a present or 

future impact on CDL’s value creation, and hence 

our business performance over time. Balancing 

internal and external viewpoints is therefore critical 

in defining aspects and issues that are of significant 

relevance to our business and stakeholders. 

Since 2008 when we published CDL’s first Social 

and Environment Report which completed the 

Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) Application Level 

Check, we have focused our sustainability efforts 

around our material environmental, social and 

governance (ESG) issues by aligning our business 

perspectives with that of our stakeholders’. Our 

materiality also takes into account our value chain 

where CDL has considerable influence, but not 

direct control. 

To keep abreast of critical issues, we periodically 

review our material issues against the changing 

business environment, stakeholder opinions, and 

emerging global and local trends. 

Stakeholder-Driven Materiality Review

Following our in-depth materiality assessment1 in 

2014, we conducted a review in February 2016 to 

validate and update CDL’s key material issues against 

today’s business and sustainability context. 

Administered by an independent consultant, the 

online survey engaged our internal and external 

stakeholder groups as outlined on the next page. 

Stakeholders were asked to rank key issues and 

to inform us on any additional issues which they 

deemed to be of concern to our business. The high 

response rate of 75% reflected the willingness of 

our internal and external stakeholders to engage 

CDL on sustainability matters, and underscored 

the importance of these issues to our business 

performance in the long-term.

As part of the review, we have refreshed our 

sustainability objectives which were established since 

2009, to reflect the current issues of concern to our 

stakeholders. CDL’s sustainability objectives can be 

found on page 17.

Additionally, we took the initiative to assess our 

material issues against the new Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs) released by United 

Nations (UN) in September 2015. As a responsible 

corporate citizen, CDL actively contributes towards 

the SDGs by effectively managing our material issues 

and building innovative collaborations across sectors. 

More details can be found on page 18 and 19.

Materiality II, AccountAbility (2013)

Stakeholder Groups

Impact and Significance

Our Employees

Our employees are part of our human capital whose competencies and 

well-being are fundamental to CDL’s operational effectiveness. We aim to 

develop their potential to drive innovation and organisational excellence.

Our Customers

Our promise is to create inspiring spaces and deliver quality homes in 

line with the rising expectations and lifestyle aspirations of tenants and 

homebuyers. CDL seeks to deliver sustainable solutions and exceptional 

service levels to delight our customers.

Our Builders and 

Suppliers

CDL works closely with partners in our value chain to ensure that 

construction activities are carried out in line with best practices in EHS  

standards and sustainable building methods.

Our Investors

We strive to maximise shareholder returns, maintain good corporate 

governance, and improve levels of transparency through financial and 

sustainability reporting and timely communication.

The Government 

and Regulators

Beyond compliance, we partner with key agencies in elevating industry 

standards for green building, sustainable practices as well as EHS.

The Media

As news and information outlets are one of the primary sources of 

information for our stakeholders and members of the public, we aim to 

engage the media in promoting the sustainability and green building 

agenda to raise eco-consciousness.

Our Community

Our developments shape public spaces and impact the interaction between 

people and their broader environment. CDL seeks to create a sense of 

shared space that benefits diverse community groups and activities through 

sustainable development and community investment.

CDL’s Stakeholders

We define our stakeholders as groups whom our business has a significant impact on, and those with a vested 

interest in our operations. By assessing the significance and impact of their interest on CDL’s business, we have 

identified seven key stakeholder groups.

*G4-24, G4-25, G4-26

DEFINING OUR MATERIAL ISSUES 

Our material issues are identified as those that are ranked as high and critical by both our internal and 

external stakeholders on the materiality matrix. We therefore focus our sustainability efforts and reporting on 

these issues that are of the most concern to our business and stakeholders.

 

CDL’s Materiality Matrix

Issues of Increased Stakeholder Concern 

The recent review has also highlighted several material issues with notable increase in concern, particularly 

from our internal stakeholders. This feedback will help us to evaluate and re-prioritise our sustainability 

practices and disclosure to align with the perspective of our stakeholders.

INTEGRATED STRATEGY FOR VALUE CREATION

ALIGNING MATERIAL ISSUES WITH SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGs)

Towards the end of 2015, the UN released a set of 17 SDGs and indicators that aim to transform the world by 

2030. CDL firmly believes that a sustainable society can only be achieved with the support of the corporate 

community, and as such we have assessed the ways in which the management of our material issues can 

contribute towards sustainable development through specific SDGs.

CDL reviewed the relevance of each of the SDGs to our business operations and material issues. Nine goals 

have been identified as being of relevance, both in terms of our potential impact on these goals, and potential 

contributions that we can make towards these goals.

SDGs Applicable to CDL

Our Impact and Contributions 

Ensure access to 

affordable, reliable, 

sustainable, and modern 

energy for all

Through best practices in energy management, low carbon operations, green features and 

retrofitting, as well as increased adoption of solar technologies, we build and manage certified 

green buildings and office interiors with energy efficiency and sustainable energy in mind. 

This aims to benefit our homebuyers, tenants, and business operations. Recognised as the 

leader in green building, CDL also plays an active role in sharing know-how within the built 

industry in Singapore and beyond.

Promote inclusive and 

sustainable economic 

growth, employment, and 

decent work for all

We adopt consistent, equitable, and fair labour policies and practices in rewarding, 

developing, and caring for our employees under the direct hire of CDL. Through our EHS 

policy and CDL 5-Star EHS Assessment System, we also ensure safe, clean, and dignified 

working and living conditions for the workers at our construction sites who are employed by 

our contractors.

Build resilient 

infrastructure, 

promote sustainable 

industrialisation, and foster 

innovation

CDL has contributed towards this goal by investing 2% to 5% of a new development’s 

construction cost on sustainable designs and construction methods and committing to local 

and international certifications for quality green homes and offices. We also strive to introduce 

at least one innovation for every new development such as AgriCube at Lush Acres and 

extensive solar panels at d’Nest.

Make cities inclusive, safe, 

resilient, and sustainable

By embedding the principle of Universal Design in all our developments, upholding 

EHS standards and driving innovations in smart and green lifestyle solutions. CDL is 

well positioned to support Singapore’s aspiration to become a clean, green, smart and 

sustainable nation.

Ensure sustainable 

consumption and 

production patterns

Through our sustained programmes to engage tenants, homebuyers, youths and members of 

the public through initiatives such as CDL Green Lease Partnership Programme, “Let’s Live 

Green” outreach, EcoBank, North West Power Up Scheme, CDL actively advocates sustainable 

consumption through behavioural changes. We also uphold responsible sourcing along the 

supply chain through our Green Procurement Guidelines and by setting a target for 35% of 

our building material to be derived from recycled content, low-carbon sources, or are certified 

by recognised environmental organisations.

Take urgent action to 

combat climate change and 

its impacts

Since 2008, CDL has established a target to reduce carbon emissions intensity across all 

our operations in Singapore. In 2015, we advanced our commitment with a Climate Change 

Policy, and have achieved a 19% carbon intensity reduction from baseline year 2007.  

We have also implemented a Greenhouse Gas (GHG) management system in line with ISO 

14064-1, and have adopted the Sectoral Decarbonisation Approach in reviewing our existing 

targets in support of Singapore’s climate goals and the COP21 Paris Agreement.

Sustainably manage 

forests, combat 

desertification, halt and 

reverse land degradation, 

halt biodiversity loss

CDL has taken steps to ensure the conservation of natural habitats and biodiversity by 

making it a standard practice during the planning stage of construction to conduct a 

Biodiversity Impact Assessment (BIA) and consult with environmental NGOs and agencies, 

where applicable. Moving forward, we are reviewing the implementation of a more rigorous 

Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for CDL’s new developments in 2016.

Promote just, peaceful and 

inclusive societies

CDL believes in creating a fair and inclusive society for our business to thrive and prosper in. 

Our steadfast commitment is evident in our ‘zero-tolerance’ policies and practices towards 

fraud and corruption, non-discrimination in hiring policy, as well as our corporate stance on 

human rights prohibiting child and forced labour in CDL’s operations and supply chain. Legal 

compliance across all our operations is of utmost concern to our business.

Revitalise the global 

partnership for sustainable 

development

As signatory to the UN Global Compact, and member to the World Green Building Council and 

Business Council for Sustainable Development Singapore, CDL has taken on an active and 

leading role in promoting best practices and enabling collaboration in advancing the CSR and 

green building agenda. We also further our advocacy efforts through participation in local and 

international forums.

INTEGRATED STRATEGY FOR VALUE CREATION

REPORT PERIOD AND SCOPE

The CDL Integrated Sustainability Report is CDL’s ninth 

standalone sustainability report. It is our latest annual 

publication dedicated to providing information on 

financial, social, and environmental performance that 

are material to CDL’s business and key stakeholders. 

Our last report was published in May 2015. 

This Report contains a full year’s data from 1 January 

to 31 December 2015 and focuses primarily on 

operations owned and managed by CDL’s Singapore 

headquarters, excluding that of our subsidiaries. The 

scope covers our principal business as a property 

developer comprising operational functions such 

as project development as well as property and 

facilities management of residential and commercial 

developments, and our corporate headquarters in 

Singapore. In 2015, property development was the 

main contributor to CDL’s pre-tax profit. 

Since 2015, we have expanded the reporting scope 

to include carbon emissions data from the following 

key subsidiaries:

• Hotels owned and managed by Millennium &amp; 

Copthorne Hotels plc (M&amp;C)

• CBM Pte Ltd

• City Serviced Offices

• Le Grove Serviced Apartments

• The Tower Club Singapore

M&amp;C has 126 hotels with about 35,000 rooms globally, 

many in key gateway cities. While CDL has a 65% 

interest in M&amp;C, the company has its own Board of 

Directors that oversees its policies and operations. The 

Board has adopted a number of policies, collectively 

referred to as Responsible Hospitality, which are 

designed to recognise M&amp;C’s wider impact on the 

communities in which it operates. M&amp;C’s CSR activities 

and full year carbon footprint are included in its Annual 

Report available at www.millenniumhotels.com.

Monetary values in this Report are presented in 

Singapore dollars, which is CDL’s functional currency. 

Where possible, we have provided up to five years of 

historical data for comparison.

CDL voluntarily discloses the information as we 

believe in upholding the principles of corporate 

transparency, disclosure, and communication with 

our stakeholders. Any variance in data from the CDL 

Annual Report 2015 is due to updates following 

the external assurance of this Sustainability Report. 

For additional information on our comprehensive 

initiatives on sustainability, please refer to our 

website www.cdl.com.sg.

Report Content

In each reporting cycle, CDL’s CSR Committee reviews 

the content of the Report to determine its relevance to 

our business. Efforts are also made to ensure that current 

and emerging material issues pertaining to sustainability 

and the interests of our stakeholders are addressed.

Other operational committees oversee existing 

management systems and certifications such as the 

ISO 14001 Environmental Management System, ISO 

50001 Energy Management System, OHSAS 18001 

Occupational Health and Safety Management System 

and Singapore Quality Class. Relevant targets and 

key performance indicators are established, tracked, 

and disclosed within this Sustainability Report.

Our Report continues to integrate the ISO 26000:2010 

Guidance on social responsibility, and the Company 

actively promotes compliance with internationally 

adopted standards and regulations in the fields of 

occupational standards, environmental protection, 

and the fight against corruption.

Reporting Boundaries and Standards

This Report is aligned with the reporting guidelines 

under the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) G4 

Comprehensive option and its guidance for the 

Construction and Real Estate Sector. This Report is 

also prepared in accordance with G4 principles for 

defining report content, including:  

• Materiality: focusing on issues that impact 

business growth and are of utmost importance to 

stakeholders;

• Stakeholder Inclusiveness: responding to 

stakeholder expectations and interests; 

• Sustainability Context: presenting performance in 

the wider context of sustainability;

• Completeness: including all information that 

is of significant economic, environmental, and 

social impact to enable stakeholders to assess the 

Company’s performance 

This Report has successfully completed the GRI 

Materiality Disclosures service which verifies that the 

General Standard Disclosures G4-17 to G4-27 were 

correctly located in both the GRI Content Index and 

in the text of this Report. The GRI Content Index can 

be found on pages 94 to 100.

This Report also adopts the International Integrated 

Reporting Council’s (IIRC) Integrated Reporting 

Framework by connecting social and environmental 

performance with business and financial impact 

*G4-22, G4-23

for a more meaningful and all-rounded corporate 

reporting. Centred around six capitals – Financial, 

Manufactured, Organisational, Social and 

Relationship, Human, and Natural – this approach 

aims to present a holistic picture to our investors 

and stakeholders on how the interrelation between 

our business and sustainability performance leads to 

value creation over the short-, medium- and long-

term. CDL’s value creation model is outlined on pages 

12 to 13.

Since 2005, CDL has been a signatory to the United 

Nations Global Compact and we are committed to 

its 10 principles. Our annual Sustainability Report 

also serves as our Communication on Progress 

(COP) addressing the areas of human rights, labour, 

environment and anti-corruption. Our COP is 

available at www.unglobalcompact.org.

Our carbon footprint is calculated in accordance 

with the World Business Council for Sustainable 

Development and World Resources Institute’s 

(WBCSD/WRI) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, 

a Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. 

This protocol is considered current best practice for 

corporate or organisational emissions reporting, and 

we measure our emissions in three ‘scopes’:

• Scope 1 — direct GHG emissions from sources 

that are owned such as company-owned vehicles 

and refrigerants

• Scope 2 — GHG emissions from purchased

• Scope 3 — indirect emissions such as our 

business travel, staff commute, and outsourced 

services

In addition to the GHG Protocol, our carbon 

emissions are also calculated based on The 

CarbonNeutral® Protocol, a set of guidelines 

to meet the global standard for managing our 

offset-inclusive programmes. The Protocol 

includes requirements for GHG assessments, 

emission reduction planning, carbon credit 

eligibility, management of carbon credits through 

registration and retirement, and communication of 

CarbonNeutral® programmes. 

We use an operational consolidation approach 

to determine organisational boundaries. Data is 

consolidated from a number of sources, including 

our project sites and fuel use information, and is 

analysed centrally. Our baseline year is 2007 and our 

emissions are independent of any GHG trades.

In line with our continual efforts to monitor and 

review CDL’s environmental practices against 

international best practices, CDL embarked on the 

stringent ISO 14064-1 for GHG verification in 2016 

– becoming the first developer to do so in Singapore.

INCREASE

VALUE THROUGH 

SUSTAINED GROWTH

FINANCIAL CAPITAL


FINANCIAL CAPITAL

Studies have shown that a company’s ability to grow 

its earnings increasingly depends on intangible 

assets such as the quality of management, brand 

equity, natural, human and intellectual capital. A 

company’s financial capital and its position in the 

market depend on its ability to generate competitive 

advantages and create economic value for its 

stakeholders and society at large. 

Sustainability trends such as climate change, 

resource scarcity and demographic changes shape 

the competitive environment in which companies 

operate by introducing long-term sustainability 

opportunities and risks. We therefore view our 

business performance beyond short-term gains and 

the financial bottom line. Our conviction is to achieve 

a balanced triple bottom line for sustained growth.

In today’s highly volatile business environment, CDL 

has, beyond sustained earnings, diligently embraced 

prudent financial management, capitalised on our 

assets and investments, and remain focused on 

growth strategies, to enhance shareholder value. 

MARKET REVIEW AND 

PERFORMANCE

Despite challenging market conditions both 

domestically and overseas, the CDL Group achieved 

a strong financial performance for the year ended 

2015, registering a revenue of $3.3 billion (FY 

2014: $3.8 billion). The decrease was largely due to 

the absence of revenue recognition from Executive 

Condominium (EC) projects as compared to revenue 

recognised in its entirety for the Blossom Residences 

EC in Q3 2014 upon its completion. Nevertheless, 

we delivered a resilient net profit after tax and non-

controlling interests (PATMI) of $773.4 million, 

comparable to $769.6 million for FY 2014. Basic 

earnings per share stood at 83.6 cents (FY 2014: 

83.2 cents) for FY 2015.

Since 2009, the Singapore Government has made 

several rounds of property cooling measures. The Total 

Debt Servicing Ratio which restricts potential buyers’ 

borrowing capacity and Additional Buyer’s Stamp 

Duty were perhaps the most drastic, and continue 

to adversely impact both sales volume and property 

prices across all residential market segments. CDL 

with our joint venture (JV) associates sold 674 units 

including ECs at a sales value of around $692 million 

for the year under review (2014: 1,378 units with 

total sales value of about $1.4 billion), a reflection of 

the weak residential property market in Singapore. 

The outlook for Singapore’s residential property 

market remains challenging as the economic growth 

forecast remains soft while interest rates are on 

the rise. As of end 2015, the remaining supply of 

24,546 unsold private residential units and 26,517 

vacant private residential units will continue to put 

downward pressure on capital values and rentals while 

transaction volumes are expected to remain moderate.

We were acutely aware that our property development 

business was highly Singapore-centric and we needed 

to reposition ourselves to mitigate the imminent 

headwinds. Over the years, we have mitigated our 

risks through our diversification strategy, by focusing 

on overseas expansion, developing unique investment 

platforms and funds management products, for a 

more balanced and diversified portfolio. 

In August 2010, we established our wholly-owned 

subsidiary – CDL China Limited, which now has 

four development sites in Suzhou, Shanghai and 

Chongqing (two sites). In May 2013, CDL announced 

our plans for property development in United 

Kingdom (UK). To date, we have seven freehold 

properties in UK. Additionally, in September 2014, 

CDL also acquired the prime Shirokane site in 

Tokyo, where acquisition of land sites is extremely 

rare and difficult in Japan, and re-entered the 

Australian residential market in December 2015. 

These overseas projects require a gestation period for 

profit recognition in accordance with the respective 

accounting treatment. However, CDL anticipates the 

projects to bear fruit in terms of recurring profits from 

2H 2016, starting with strong sales from the Phase 

1 launch of our Suzhou Hong Leong City Center and 

the Hongqiao Royal Lake project in Shanghai.

CDL Group’s total EBITDA* is about $1.3 billion. 

Our business today is one in which 71% of EBITDA 

and 51% of total assets (excluding tax recoverable 

and deferred tax asset) is from recurring income 

segments. We are de-risking our Singapore exposure 

and today, our overseas segment accounts for 27% 

of EBITDA and 45% of total assets, including our 

hotel portfolio under our London-listed subsidiary, 

Millennium and Copthorne Hotels plc (M&amp;C).

PRUDENT CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

AND SUSTAINABLE DIVIDEND POLICY

CDL’s primary objective in capital management is 

to maintain a strong capital base so as to sustain 

investor, creditor and market confidence, and to 

continue to develop and grow our business.

We manage our capital structure and make adjustments 

to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. 

For this purpose, CDL defines “capital” as including 

all components of equity, including non-controlling 

interests. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, 

CDL may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders 

or issue new shares or other financial instruments.

The Company’s dividend policy aims to provide a 

return to shareholders at least once a year through 

24


the payment of dividends, after taking into account 

the Group’s financial performance, short and long-

term capital requirements, future investment plans, 

general global and business economic conditions and 

any regulatory factors. The CDL Board endeavours to 

maintain a balance between meeting shareholders’ 

expectations and prudent capital management with a 

sustainable dividend policy; and will review the policy 

from time to time and reserves the right to modify, 

amend and update the policy.

CDL monitors capital using a net debt equity ratio, 

which is defined as net borrowings divided by total 

capital employed. In 2015, we maintained a strong 

balance sheet with cash and cash equivalents of $3.6 

billion and a healthy net gearing ratio of 26%, without 

factoring the fair value gains on our investment 

properties, and 19% if fair value accounting is used. 

A strong position, together with banking facilities, 

provides us with capital to seize opportunities for 

acquisitions and other platforms for growth.

FINANCIAL CAPITAL

ACQUISITIONS AND EXPANSION

A key focus of CDL’s growth strategy is to actively 

build our overseas platforms while seizing suitable 

opportunities in Singapore. Collectively, the Group’s 

major international and domestic acquisitions in 

2015 amounted to almost $1 billion.

UK

CDL acquired the landmark Stag Brewery land site 

in Mortlake in December, within the London Borough 

of Richmond upon Thames in southwest London, for 

£158 million. The expansive 89,031 square metre 

(sqm) (approximately 22 acres) freehold site offers 

tremendous potential for redevelopment into a mixed-

use scheme with a riverside residential belt.

The purchase comes on the back of CDL’s £85 

million acquisition of the Teddington Studios site in 

November, also located within the London Borough 

of Richmond. The 18,211 sqm freehold site will be 

redeveloped into a luxury riverside condominium.

With the two acquisitions, to date CDL has invested 

a total of £400 million in seven prime freehold 

properties in the UK, after successfully monetising 

Emerald House with a profit of approximately  

£5.7 million.

On the hospitality front, M&amp;C acquired the world’s 

only Beatles-inspired hotel, Hard Days Night Hotel 

in Liverpool, the UK, for £13.8 million. Located in 

the heart of Liverpool’s Cavern Quarter, the hotel 

comprises 110 guest rooms and suites.

CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT), M&amp;C’s subsidiary, 

acquired Hilton Cambridge City Centre (previously 

known as Cambridge City Hotel) in the UK, valued 

at £61.5 million. The acquisition of this upscale 

198-room hotel, which is near popular tourist 

destinations, was a rare opportunity in a tightly-

held investment market and marks CDLHT’s first 

investment in Europe.

Australia

CDL also re-entered the Australian residential sector. 

In partnership with leading Australian developers, 

Abacus Property Group and KPG Capital, CDL will 

jointly develop a prime residential land site in 

Brisbane’s highly sought-after South Bank precinct. 

CDL and Abacus will jointly provide the majority of 

the equity funding with CDL contributing a preferred 

equity interest of approximately A$30 million.

Singapore

In Singapore, CDL and our JV partners won a tightly 

contested bid by a thin margin of 2.6% over 10 other 

bidders, for a 99-year leasehold residential site at 

Lorong Lew Lian for $321 million. The 14,001.5 

sqm site is located within walking distance of 

Serangoon MRT station and bus interchange. There 

are plans to develop a residential project of up to 

13-storeys with over 500 units.

FUNDS MANAGEMENT

One of our major milestones in 2015 was 

the successful execution of our second Profit 

Participation Securities (PPS) investment platform. 

Riding on the success of our first PPS launched in 

2014, our second PPS involved a joint investment 

between CDL and Alpha Investment Partners 

Limited (Alpha) in a $1.1 billion office portfolio 

comprising three of CDL’s prime office buildings: 

Central Mall (Office Tower), Manulife Centre and 7 

and 9 Tampines Grande. These assets were sold as 

99-year leasehold tenures, and CDL retains upside 

from our long-term reversionary title for both Central 

Mall (Office Tower) and Manulife Centre, which 

are freehold and 999-year leasehold properties 

respectively. The assets have a strong occupancy 

average of 98% and a high-quality and diversified 

tenant base.

The total aggregated value of the securities issued 

in the PPS transaction is $333.5 million. Alpha and 

CDL co-financed the portfolio in the ratio of 60:40. 

The investors will receive a fixed coupon payout of 

5% per annum for a period of five years, in relation 

to a component of the PPS transaction involving the 

subscription of bonds. Two banks provided senior 

loan facilities of $750.1 million.

When the assets are divested, the first priority will be 

to repay the bank borrowings, followed by repaying 

Alpha’s $200.2 million capital, then a preferred 

return to Alpha amounting to a total internal rate 

of return of up to 12.6% per annum (inclusive of 

the 5% annual coupon payment). CDL will then 

be repaid its $133.3 million capital investment. 

Thereafter, whatever cash flows remain will be split 

between Alpha and CDL in the proportion of 40:60 

respectively.

This initiative enabled the Group to recycle 

capital for our growth plans and realise the capital 

appreciation potential of our real estate assets. 

Through the partnership with our co-investor, CDL 

remains a substantial investor and continues to 

manage the three prime office assets. The Group now 

has $2.6 billion in funds under management through 

our two PPS vehicles.

LOOKING AHEAD

2016 will be a challenging year for businesses across 

many sectors as the global growth outlook remains 

dim. Domestically, the effects of oversupply, higher 

land and construction costs, and prevailing property 

cooling measures continue to dampen both demand 

and prices.

The Group is keeping a close tab on the Singapore 

property market, ready to seize opportunities 

with changing market conditions; and we are 

building value through geographical and product 

diversification. 

We are well-poised to deploy our strong balance 

sheet towards acquisitions in a period of rising 

market dislocation, while maintaining discipline in 

our investments. We will continue to expand our 

international footprint in our five key markets – China, 

UK, US, Japan and Australia; capitalise the value of 

our assets; and grow our funds management platform.

ORGANISATIONAL CAPITAL

LEADERSHIP AND CULTURE

The Company has a strong commitment to the triple 

bottom line approach established by our late Deputy 

Chairman Mr Kwek Leng Joo two decades ago. Today 

the Company continues this strong DNA of doing well 

financially and doing good for the society and the 

environment, under the leadership of our CEO.

Refining our Vision, Mission 

and Values (VMV)

Our corporate VMV established since the mid-1990s 

has gained us good stead in directing our paths 

towards strong, ethical and sustained business growth. 

To complement the Company’s business strategy 

in today’s fast-evolving business environment, an 

enhanced set of corporate VMV has been set.

The refined VMV, proposed by our Top Management 

and approved by the Board in 2015, was the result 

of a rigorous process of internal consultations and 

gap analysis led by senior staff, Head of Departments 

(HODs), and a group of high potential employees. 

The new VMV can be found on page 9 of this 

report. The enhanced VMV will guide our actions in 

supporting the Company’s new direction, expanded 

operating environments, and changing expectations 

of stakeholders, employees and customers.

A town hall involving all staff was held in April 2016 

to launch the new VMV and our employees continue 

to share their stories of how they are applying CDL’s 

VMV in their everyday interactions towards an 

enduring and sustainable business. 

Setting the Tone for Communication 

through All Levels 

Aligning our corporate culture and employees’ 

commitment with the Company’s strategic goals is 

key to our business performance and sustainability. 

We provide employees with clear directions through 

regular communication and review of processes at 

all levels. Our Senior Management and HODs, who 

are highly involved in setting the direction, meet 

regularly to look into key issues. Our review and 

communication channels include:

• Weekly Senior Management Meetings to discuss 

and review strategic initiatives

• Monthly HOD Meetings for operational updates 

and senior leaders’ directions 

• Quarterly Business Operations Meetings where 

frontline HODs review operational issues

• Quarterly Risk Management Committee (RMC) 

Meetings chaired by our CEO and attended by 

members of Senior Management and HODs in 

charge of the Company’s strategic risks to provide 

updates, guidance and reporting of key risk 

issues. The RMC also reports quarterly to the 

Board Audit and Risk Committee (ARC)

• Regular taskforce meetings chaired by our CEO/ 

Group General Manager/Chiefs on matters such as 

CSR, ISO 14001, risk management, and tenant 

engagement

• CEO staff dialogues where our CEO will receive 

feedback from employees and share Top 

Management’s vision for CDL

• Town hall and staff events throughout the year 

where Top Management communicates business 

directions and challenges, celebrates good 

results, and addresses employees’ queries

• A structured induction programme where HODs 

brief new hires on their respective departments, 

while the Human Resources (HR) department 

shares on CDL’s VMV and organisation

• CDL360, an employee communications platform 

updated with CDL’s VMV, Code of Business 

Conduct and Ethics, corporate policies, HR 

initiatives, CSR information, Company-wide 

announcements and news about CDL

Aligning with Best Practices

We recognise that organisational capital is in general 

qualitative in nature and it may not be meaningful to 

quantify its performance. However, where applicable, 

we strive to align our policies and practices to best-

in-class, international and national standards and 

rankings including:

• ISO 9001 – Quality Management

• ISO 14001 – Environmental Management

• ISO 14064 – Greenhouse Gas Emissions

• ISO 26000 – Guidance on Social Responsibility

• ISO 50001 – Energy Management Systems

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

CDL remains dedicated to maintaining good

business activities, which is essential for the long-

term sustainability of our business.

To demonstrate our promise in upholding the highest 

standards of corporate governance, CDL has joined the 

Securities Investors Association (Singapore) (SIAS) 

and its partners since 2010 in making the following 

public Statement of Support, which was reiterated at 

the 6th Singapore Corporate Governance Week 2015 

(organised by the SIAS) in October 2015:

“As an Organisation, we are committed to upholding 

high standards of corporate governance to enhance 

shareholder value. We believe practising good 

corporate governance is central to the health and 

stability of our financial markets and economy.”

At the SIAS Investors’ Choice Awards 2015, CDL 

was conferred the prestigious “Most Transparent 

Company Award 2015” in the Real Estate category 

for our outstanding efforts in corporate disclosure 

and transparency standards. CDL’s Board was also 

recognised for its leadership in raising the bar for 

corporate governance with the Company winning 

the “Best Corporate Governance” award in the 

Real Estate Developer Sector (Asia) at the Ethical 

Boardroom Corporate Governance Awards 2015. 

Our corporate governance practices are set out in 

CDL’s 2015 Annual Report with specific reference 

to the principles and guidelines of the Code of 

Corporate Governance 2012 (2012 Code). Where 

CDL’s practices differ from the principles and

CORPORATE VALUES AND CONDUCT 

OF BUSINESS 

The Board and Senior Management remain steadfast 

in conducting business with integrity, consistent 

with the high standards of business ethics, and in 

compliance with all applicable laws and regulatory 

requirements. This shapes a culture of responsibility 

among employees, with a system of checks and 

balances at all levels of the organisation.

Code of Business Conduct and Ethics

CDL has an internal Code of Business Conduct and 

Ethics crystallising the Company’s business principles 

and practices on matters which may have ethical 

implications. The code provides a communicable 

and understandable framework for staff to observe 

the Company’s principles such as honesty, integrity, 

responsibility and accountability at all levels of 

the organisation and in conducting the Company’s 

business and in dealings with customers, suppliers 

and colleagues. Employees can easily access the code 

on CDL’s intranet. 

The code provides guidance on issues such as:

• Conflicts of interest and the appropriate disclosures 

to be made

• The Company’s stance against corruption  

and bribery

• Compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

including those relating to the protection of the 

environment and the conservation of energy and 

natural resources

• Compliance with the Company’s policies and 

procedures, including those on internal controls 

and accounting

• Safeguarding and proper use of the Company’s 

assets, confidential information and intellectual 

property rights, including the respect of the 

intellectual property rights of third parties 

• Competition and fair dealing in the conduct of 

the Company’s business, in its relationships with 

customers, suppliers, competitors and employees

Internal Code on Dealings in Securities

CDL’s internal code on securities trading sets out the 

implications of insider trading and provides guidance 

and internal regulation with regard to dealings in the 

Company’s securities by its Directors and officers. 

These guidelines prohibit dealing in the Company’s 

securities (a) on short-term considerations, (b) while 

in possession of unpublished material and price-

sensitive information in relation to such securities, 

and (c) during the “closed period”, which is defined 

as two weeks before the date of announcement of 

results for the first, second, and third quarter of 

the Company’s financial year and one month before 

the date of announcement of the full-year financial 

results, and ending on the date of the announcement 

of the relevant results. The Directors and employees 

of the Company are notified in advance of the 

commencement of each “closed period” relating to 

dealing in the Company’s securities. Employees can 

easily access the code on CDL’s intranet.

CORPORATE POLICIES AND GUIDELINES 

In line with the Board’s stance to maintain high 

ethical standards which are integral to our corporate 

identity and business, CDL has the following 

corporate policies and guidelines in place, which are 

publicly available on our corporate website  

(www.cdl.com.sg) and intranet for easy access by all 

employees. The policies have also been disseminated 

to employees of CDL’s key subsidiaries, where 

applicable. 

Anti-Corruption Policy and Guidelines

This set of policy and guidelines spell out 

the responsibilities of CDL’s companies and 

employees in observing and upholding CDL’s ‘zero-

tolerance’ position against all forms of corruption, 

bribery, and extortion. It also provides information 

and guidance to employees on how to recognise, 

address, resolve, avoid, and prevent instances of 

corruption, bribery, and extortion which may arise 

in the course of their work.

Fraud Policy and Guidelines

CDL provides guidance on actions which may 

constitute fraudulent conduct and highlights the 

importance of the implementation, maintenance, 

and compliance with the internal controls framework 

of the Group and its policies and procedures.

31


Whistle-Blowing Policy 

CDL has a whistle-blowing procedure which 

enables employees and other persons to raise in 

confidence, whether anonymously or otherwise, 

concerns on possible improprieties relating to 

accounting, financial reporting, internal controls, 

auditing or other matters, without fear of reprisal 

in any form. The ARC has the responsibility of 

overseeing this Policy, which is administered 

with the assistance of the Head of IA. Under 

these procedures, arrangements are in place for 

independent investigation and for appropriate 

follow-up actions to be taken.

To facilitate and encourage reporting, the Whistle-

Blowing Policy together with the dedicated whistle-

blowing communication channels (email and postal 

address as well as telephone contact numbers) are 

available on the Company’s website and intranet, 

and are easily accessible by all employees and 

other persons.

Toll-free lines for callers from Singapore, China, and 

Thailand are now available. Direct email channels 

to the Board Chairman, CEO, and ARC Chairman

Senior Management and the Head of IA.

Personal Data Policy

CDL’s Personal Data Policy serves to inform our 

stakeholders on how CDL manages personal data 

in compliance with the Singapore Personal Data 

Protection Act (No. 26 of 2012). Customers can 

contact our Data Protection Officer by mail, email, 

and phone on the following:

• Any questions, complaints or feedback relating to 

their Personal Data or our Personal Data Policy

• To withdraw their consent to our use of their 

Personal Data as set out in our Personal Data Policy

• To obtain access and/or make corrections to 

their Personal Data records under our control or 

in our possession

Competition Policy and Guidelines

It is CDL’s policy to compete fairly and ethically in 

the conduct of business in all our markets, and this 

Policy seeks to:

• Educate and improve our employees’ knowledge 

and understanding of anti-competitive practices, 

conduct and acts which amount to an abuse of 

a dominant position in the market, which are 

prohibited

• Provide direction and guidance to employees 

in their relationships and communications with 

competitors and customers

EHS Policy

CDL’s corporate EHS Policy reflects our pledge 

towards a ‘Safe and Green’ culture. The Policy 

includes KPIs for departments contributing to our 

EHS performance. This ensures that we achieve 

a consistently high EHS standard across the 

organisation.

Climate Change Policy

CDL supports Singapore’s INDC of reducing its 

Emissions Intensity by 36% from 2005 levels 

by 2030, and to stabilise emissions with the 

aim of peaking around 2030. Based on existing 

procedures and policies demonstrating our duty to 

mitigate climate change, a Climate Change Policy 

was formalised on 3 March 2015.

Corporate Statement on Human Rights

Advocating human rights is important to CDL. 

We recognise the need to look at the broader 

Singapore context and keep in mind the priorities 

and challenges of the industry. While CDL 

understands that the Company can only act 

within the scope of our core business activities, 

we ensure that the direction and outcome of our 

actions are constantly monitored and improved on.

In doing so, CDL:

• Embraces diversity and inclusivity at the 

workplace and appreciates contributions by all 

employees

• Provides just and favourable work conditions in a 

fair manner

• Supports the right to work and recognises that 

job creation and protection are fundamental 

business responsibilities

• Strives to work with builders in protecting the 

rights of foreign workers they hire

ORGANISATIONAL CAPITAL

32


In addition, CDL seeks to uphold fair and responsible 

practices and promote inclusivity in all our business 

activities, by effecting the following responsibilities 

along our value chain. 

Pledge for Zero – A CEO Commitment Charter

CDL is a founding signatory of the “Pledge for 

Zero – A CEO Commitment Charter”, which was 

launched at the inaugural Construction CEO 

Summit organised by the Workplace Safety and 

Health Council in November 2008. CDL adopted 

the pledge and committed to establishing a 

zero-injury workplace. In 2010, CDL invited our 

builders and consultants to sign the pledge and 

collectively commit to raising EHS standards at our 

construction sites in Singapore. The commitment 

was renewed at the 11th Anniversary of CDL’s 

annual EHS Awards in 2015.

Employers’ Pledge of Fair Employment Practices

CDL is a signatory of the Employers’ Pledge of Fair 

Employment Practices with the Tripartite Alliance 

for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP). TAFEP 

works with employer organisations, unions and the 

Government to create awareness and facilitate the 

adoption of fair employment practices. The alliance 

is co-chaired by representing employer unions and 

National Trades Union Congress.

Green Procurement Guidelines

Reflecting our belief in more efficient use of 

resources, we have a set of Green Procurement 

Guidelines in place for the selection of vendors and 

suppliers at our Corporate Office and across our core 

business operations in Singapore. The guidelines 

include:

• Sharing the corporate EHS Policy with new 

vendors and suppliers

• Indicating preference for use of eco-friendly and 

recycled materials and products

• Indicating preference for ISO 14001  

certified vendors

• Declaring the use of eco-friendly and recycled 

paper in printed materials

Supplier Code of Conduct

In August 2015, a Supplier Code of Conduct was 

introduced across CDL’s core business operations 

in Singapore. The Code provides comprehensive 

guiding principles for our vendors and suppliers 

to comply with CDL’s expectations of ethical 

standards, covering the following areas: 

• Business integrity 

 

 

• Fair competition  

 

 

• Open communication 

 

• Conflict of interest

• Gifts and entertainment

• EHS 

• Legal compliance

• Human rights

• Reciprocity

Ethical Marketing Practices

Since 2000, we have developed a set of internal 

procedures and an operations manual for marketing 

and leasing. These are reviewed annually to reflect 

changes in marketing practices, technology, 

regulation, and stakeholder expectations.

Marketing collaterals produced by CDL are 

compliant with the Singapore Code of Advertising 

Practice administered by the Advertising Standards 

Authority of Singapore, an advisory council to the 

Consumers Association of Singapore. 

CDL’s marketing practices also comply with the Urban 

Redevelopment Authority’s Housing Developers Rules 

(HDR) and Building and Construction Authority’s 

(BCA) Guidelines for Outdoor Signs at our construction 

sites. The HDR seeks to enhance transparency in the 

real estate industry, enabling homebuyers to make 

better informed decisions when buying a home, 

while the BCA guidelines prohibit cross-marketing 

of other products and services.

33


Board Diversity Pledge

In July 2015, CDL supported the Board Diversity 

Pledge initiated by the Singapore Institute of 

Directors and SGX. By taking the pledge, the 

Company commits to promoting diversity as a key 

attribute of a well-functioning and effective Board. 

This is in line with our belief that a diverse Board 

will enhance decision-making by harnessing the 

variety of skills, industry and business experiences, 

gender, age, ethnicity and culture, geographical 

background and nationalities, tenure of service, 

and other distinguishing qualities of the members 

of the Board.

Universal Design Policy

CDL develops a wide range of properties from 

mass market Executive Condominiums to luxury 

homes. Regardless of property type, we believe that 

resource-efficient buildings can be a differentiator. 

We also continue to embed the principles of 

Universal Design – “design for all people” in 

all our projects, over and above the mandatory 

requirements specified in the Code of Barrier-Free 

Accessibility by BCA.

Our design brief includes features that encourage 

community-building and social integration. Our 

Universal Design Policy, which is endorsed by CDL’s 

Top Management, provides the Company with a 

framework to achieve our objective of creating an 

inclusive built environment mindful of developing 

buildings that respond to differing customer needs.

Procedures for Compliance

As part of CDL’s corporate governance process, all 

employees are required to complete a compulsory 

annual online declaration to acknowledge that they 

are aware of, have read, and are in compliance with 

the policies, standards, and practices as set out in 

the Company’s Corporate Policies and Guidelines. 

These Policies include the Code of Business Conduct 

and Ethics as well as policies and guidelines on Anti-

Corruption, Fraud, Competition, Whistle-Blowing, 

Personal Data Protection, and EHS. 

During the induction and training programme for all 

new employees, information is provided in respect 

of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and 

related corporate policies including Anti-Corruption, 

Fraud, and Competition. 

Employees and other parties who have a business 

relationship with CDL can raise in confidence, whether 

anonymously or otherwise, concerns of non-compliance 

through any of the dedicated whistle-blowing channels 

which are available on the CDL website. 

In 2015, CDL had no incidents of non-compliance with 

the Singapore Code of Advertising Practice, nor with 

laws and regulations for which significant fines or non-

monetary sanctions were issued to the Company. There 

were also zero incidents of anti-competitive behaviour 

and monopoly practices within the Company. 

CDL had no incident of fraud and corruption across our 

business operations in Singapore for the year of 2015.

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Risk management is a critical component to our 

business success. When fully embedded, risk 

management assumes an important component in all 

our business activities and serves as a beacon for our 

strategic planning and decision-making process. 

Board Audit &amp; Risk Committee (ARC)

The Board has overall responsibility to ensure that 

the Company has the capability and necessary 

framework to manage risks in new and existing 

businesses, and that business plans and strategies 

accord with the risk appetite that the Company 

undertakes to achieve its corporate objectives. 

To assist the Board to discharge its role in risk 

management oversight, the ARC has been delegated 

by the Board to provide oversight and to review 

matters relating to the risk management policies and 

systems of the Company.

Risk Management Committee (RMC)

The ARC’s risk management function is assisted by the 

RMC, whose members comprise Senior Management 

and relevant HODs, Business Units and Corporate 

Functions. The RMC is responsible for ensuring the 

effectiveness of the risk management framework of 

the Company, with a mandate to focus on key strategic 

risks whilst also ensuring that the business units are 

held responsible for the management, monitoring and 

control of risks in their day-to-day operations. Since 

2015, the RMC has also been provided quarterly risk 

reports from local operating subsidiaries, operations 

from China and Thailand as well as Millennium and 

Copthorne Hotels plc (M&amp;C). This greatly enhanced 

the visibility of the ARC in operational risks outside 

Singapore while allowing a unified value of good 

corporate governance and risk management to be 

shared in our overseas operations. 

CDL’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 

Framework

The Company’s ERM framework was developed to 

realise the value of risk management by providing an 

enterprise-wide view of the risks involved in property 

investment, development and management activities, 

and institutionalising a systematic risk assessment 

methodology for the identification, assessment, 

management and reporting of risks on a consistent 

and reliable basis. 

The ERM function provides the RMC and Senior 

Management with regular updates on key strategic 

risks, assessment of key risk exposures and any 

new emerging risks that may require mitigations. It 

also assists the RMC to report quarterly to the ARC 

on overall strategic and operational risk positions, 

including mitigation measures, treatment plans, and 

the occurrence or potential occurrence of significant 

risk events.

The RMC and ERM regularly review the framework 

against international standards and best practices in 

risk management to establish a holistic, structured, 

and consistent process for the identification, 

assessment, evaluation, monitoring, and reporting of 

risks. Continuous training to build risk awareness 

and competencies, as well as systems and tools to 

operationalise the risk management framework are put 

in place to support this critical function. 

The framework has categorised CDL’s strategic 

business risks into the following main types:

• Operational risks

• Investment and portfolio risks 

• Treasury and financial risks

• Human resource risks

• Crisis risks

• Information technology risks

• EHS risks

• Market risks 

• M&amp;C risks

For full details on each risk type, please refer to the 

Risk Management Report in CDL Annual Report 2015. 

35


Reviews and Improvements 

Against the backdrop of unprecedented global 

climate actions and public commitments, as well as 

our own pledge to comply with workplace health and 

safety standards, a review was conducted in 2015 

to expand our EHS risk portfolio to include emerging 

risks that are material to our business:

• Climate change

• Water

• Raw material supply

• Workplace safety and health

• EHS legal compliance 

Developed in 2014, the Control Self-Assessment 

(CSA) programme was fully implemented across 

CDL’s core business operations in project 

development, property and facilities management 

as well as marketing and leasing in 2015. 

Promoting greater ownership and accountability, 

the programme allows HODs and their employees 

to jointly assess their operating risks against 

established control measures, strengthen 

improvement areas and inculcate good governance 

at the operational level. The outcomes of each 

exercise were reviewed by Senior Management and 

independently validated by IA. This management-

led initiative aims to enhance management 

assurance from bottom up, as part of CDL’s ERM 

Framework to manage risks proactively and shift 

mindsets on the ground progressively. Plans are 

also underway to roll out the CSA programme to key 

local subsidiaries in 2016 and overseas business 

operations in 2017. 

Risk management must be an ongoing process. Our 

RMC and ERM functions continue to look into global 

best practices and ways to sharpen our awareness of 

global trends, new threats and emerging technologies 

to mitigate long-term risks that may have a profound 

impact on our business sustainability.

Identified Areas of Improvement

Integrate risk management as a part of 

strategic and operational decision-making 

process within the Company by building 

a strong risk culture and instilling risk 

accountability and ownership at all levels

Continual review of the effectiveness of the 

systems of internal controls to limit, mitigate, 

manage, and monitor identified risks

Ensure that information required for effective 

risk management is delivered adequately and in 

a timely manner

Build on and integrate into our existing 

governance and management systems the 

appropriate tools for effective management of 

strategic business risks which are reflective of 

changes in markets, products, technologies and 

embracing emerging global best practices

Embed risk management into employees as part 

of our Company’s value and culture

CDL strongly believes that the most senior executive in 

the Company sets the “tone from the top” towards risk 

management and instils an effective risk culture. This 

is crucial for the success of risk management at both 

operational and strategic levels. To reinforce the desired 

culture and to promote accountability and ownership at 

all levels, our management and employees are engaged 

regularly on risk management related activities such 

as risk identification and assessment workshops and 

topical talks by external consultants. 

MOVING FORWARD

CDL recognises that risks cannot be eliminated 

and can only be managed to acceptable levels. 

Nevertheless, we remain steadfast in continuously 

refining and improving our risk management 

framework, systems, and processes to ensure that risks 

are being well managed and monitored throughout the 

organisation, to thrive in an increasingly dynamic and 

changing business environment. 

BRAND AND REPUTATION 

Beyond our policies, processes, and tacit knowledge, we value the positive reputation and deep trust in our 

brand gained through CDL’s sustainability track record and achievements.

NATURAL CAPITAL

INTENSIFY

EFFORTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL 

SUSTAINABILITY


NATURAL CAPITAL

A thriving, healthy natural environment is critical for 

the sustainability of businesses. The built sector has 

a high environmental impact – buildings use about 

40% of global energy and resources and account for 

30% of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), the largest 

contributor. The Earth’s natural resources are finite, 

and the availability of these resources directly affects 

our bottom line as well as our capacity to create safe 

and efficient spaces for our customers. As a developer 

and landlord, our operations heavily rely on natural 

resources including energy, water, wood and other 

building materials. The rising cost of these resources 

will have a high impact on the long-term sustainability 

and financial performance of our business.

Effective management of natural capital has long been 

a key priority for CDL. Since adopting the ethos of 

‘Conserving as we Construct’ in 1995, we have put in 

place a host of policies and practices to mitigate our 

environmental impact. This aims to maintain strong 

natural capital for CDL, today and tomorrow.

The Environment sub-committee under the 

company-wide CSR Committee identifies significant 

environmental aspects and manages impacts that 

result from our corporate operations, property 

development and facilities management activities. 

Under the advice of our Senior Management, we 

continue to assess our material environmental 

aspects which include carbon emissions1, energy 

use, water use, waste, and resource management. In 

addition, we also monitor and report other aspects 

such as biodiversity and noise, which are important 

to some of our stakeholders. 

CLIMATE CHANGE AND EMISSIONS

In Singapore, the building sector is responsible 

for as much as 37%2 of electricity consumption 

and is projected to contribute to about 13.8%3 of 

Singapore’s Business-As-Usual (BAU) GHG emissions 

by 2020. As a major developer and manager of 

property assets, CDL is committed to low-carbon 

operations through actions outlined in our Climate 

Change Policy on page 32.

As Singapore is a low-lying and densely populated 

island, the projected increase in average 

temperatures and rise in sea levels may pose a risk 

to our core activities. More frequent warmer days will 

result in increased demand for cooling and declining 

air quality in cities. These have implications on 

the property sector including increased demands 

on ventilation and air conditioning equipment, 

which will result in higher operating costs due to 

greater plant wear and tear and increased energy 

consumption.

Through our climate change adaptation initiatives, we 

reduce the risk of business disruption that may affect 

our customers and residents, and mitigate potential 

damage and costs associated with the repair and 

maintenance of our assets due to extreme weather 

and global warming. 

Measuring and Reducing Carbon Emissions

To track and mitigate our climate impact, CDL has 

established targets to reduce our carbon emissions 

intensity by 22% by 2020 and 25% by 2030, below 

BAU levels from the baseline year 2007. In 2015, 

CDL achieved a reduction in total carbon intensity 

emissions by 19%. 

To better manage our carbon reduction efforts, we 

have implemented a GHG management system 

according to the requirements of ISO 14064-1,  

and have externally audited and validated our 

emissions computations in 2015. ISO 14064-1 is an 

international standard that specifies organisational-

level principles and requirements for quantification 

and reporting of GHG emissions and removals. 

Since 2009, CDL has also voluntarily reduced 

our annual carbon emissions to ‘net zero’ for our 

Corporate Office operations including our data 

centre and 11 Tampines Concourse – the first 

CarbonNeutral® development in Singapore and Asia 

Pacific. Besides carbon neutralising the construction 

phase of 11 Tampines Concourse, we also annually 

offset emissions from its operations, including that of 

our tenants.

NATURAL CAPITAL

The largest source of emissions was electricity 

usage at CDL-managed commercial and industrial 

properties, which accounted for about 75% of the 

Company’s carbon footprint in Singapore.

Improving Disclosure on Carbon Emissions

Even though the reporting of Scope 3 emissions is 

voluntary, we monitor and disclose the emissions to 

better assess their impact across the entire value 

chain and identify the most effective ways to reduce 

emissions. Since 2014, we have included hotel 

accommodations from business travels and employee 

commute in our calculations. 

As a result of CDL’s ongoing overseas diversification 

strategy, air travel from our Corporate Office has 

been increasing since 2014 due to the higher 

frequency of business travel. The Company advocates 

communication via audio or video conferencing where 

possible so as to minimise overseas travel. 

For greater disclosure and accountability of the 

Group’s carbon footprint, CDL has started to track and 

report the carbon emissions of our key subsidiaries 

in Singapore and overseas since 2014. The following 

table shows carbon emissions from the 126 hotels 

under Millennium and Copthorne Hotels plc (M&amp;C) 

across 20 countries, CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT), 

CBM Pte Ltd, City Serviced Offices (CSO), Le Grove 

Serviced Apartments as well as Tower Club.

ENERGY MANAGEMENT AND 

EFFICIENCY 

Property development and facilities management are 

energy intensive activities that use both electricity 

from the grid and diesel to drive generators. Any 

use of energy will inadvertently create a negative 

environmental impact – emissions, whether direct or 

indirect, contribute to global warming and air quality 

deterioration. The extraction of fossil fuels causes 

depletion of natural resources and potential oil spills 

may threaten delicate ecosystems.

As electricity constitutes a significant proportion of 

our assets’ operating expenditure, improvements 

in energy efficiency enables us to reduce cost and 

optimises our operational efficiency. Integrating 

energy efficiency considerations into the design and 

construction of our assets can also help to reduce the 

energy usage and electricity costs of our customers, 

tenants, and residents.

Initiatives to maximise energy efficiency are 

applied differently across our key business units 

and at different stages in the building’s lifecycle. 

Each business unit has its own specific guidelines 

that detail the strategic initiatives, performance 

standards, and specific requirements relating to 

energy efficiency and climate change mitigation 

measures. These guidelines are to be considered in 

the design, construction, and operation of the assets.

By innovating, developing, and adopting energy 

efficient fixtures and renewable energy solutions 

in our properties, CDL seeks to reduce electricity 

consumption and contribute towards the property 

industry’s know-how in green innovations for a low-

carbon future. 

In 2014, CDL became the first developer in 

Singapore to achieve the ISO 50001 EnMS 

certification for the provision of property and facilities 

management services in our managed buildings. 

We also actively engage our tenants on the 

importance of energy conservation. In partnership 

with Tuas Power, an Automated Meter Reading 

portal was introduced in 2014 for our tenants to 

monitor their electricity use on a near real-time 

basis, allowing them to better manage their energy 

consumption. Incentives are provided by both

Tuas Power and CDL to tenants with substantial 

reductions in energy consumption.

5 World Resource Institute’s Ranking of the World’s Most Water-stressed Countries in 2040

As a result of our energy-saving initiatives, CDL 

achieved a reduction of 27% for total energy use 

intensity in 2015 across all CDL commercial and 

industrial buildings against the baseline year of 2007.

In 2015, there were significantly more development 

projects at the intensive construction stages. This 

resulted in a 18% increase in energy use intensity at 

construction sites as compared to 2014. As projects 

are at different construction phases across the year, 

energy usage varies based on site activities. Due 

to site constraints, some projects faced difficulties 

switching to grid electricity from less efficient diesel-

powered generators.

In 2015, CDL introduced targets to reduce energy 

use across our core business operations in Singapore 

by 22% by 2020 and 25% by 2030 from the 

baseline year 2007. For the year in review, CDL 

achieved 27% reduction in energy use intensity 

across the entire company, exceeding our 25% target 

set for 2030. This demonstrates our commitment to 

reducing our energy use intensity.

WATER MANAGEMENT  

AND QUALITY 

Water is essential in supporting life. It is an 

important resource for us to manage our assets 

and plays an important role in creating attractive, 

healthy, and efficient green spaces in which our 

customers want to live and work. The use of water in 

our business activities may reduce the availability of 

freshwater. As some of our core business activities 

result in degradative water use, pollution may occur 

if wastewater discharge is not managed properly.

Taking a strategic approach towards effective water 

management systems to minimise consumption 

and manage water quality is a key priority. We 

recognise the importance of effectively managing 

water consumption and the quality of rainwater 

run-off leaving our project sites. We acknowledge 

the significant benefits that arise from a strategic 

approach to water management and quality, as it 

enhances the efficiency, resilience, desirability and 

long-term value of our assets and developments. 

Not only do they deliver significant benefits to the 

environment, but they also promote performance and 

cost efficiencies across our operations.

With climate change and a rapidly growing population, 

the demand for water is likely to surge in the next few 

decades. Even though Singapore is likely to become 

one of the world’s most water stressed countries5 come 

2040, the national water agency, PUB, has built a 

robust and diversified water supply known as the ‘Four 

National Taps’.

From the initial design stages all the way through to 

construction and management, CDL’s developments 

are conceptualised with a strong focus on water 

sustainability. Such responsible water management 

practices allow us to deliver value to our customers 

through cost savings.

our key business processes. 

CDL has also implemented a variety of Silt and Earth 

Control Measures at all construction sites to ensure 

that Total Suspended Solids (TSS) readings of the 

discharged water do not exceed the legal limit of 50 

mg/litre. In 2015, the highest TSS level discharged 

across all 15 construction sites was 26 mg/litre, well 

below the legal limit.

In recognition of our significant contribution towards 

Singapore’s water sustainability, CDL was one of the 

first recipients of the inaugural Watermark Award by 

PUB in 2007. Since the inception of PUB’s Active, 

Beautiful, and Clean Waters certification in 2010, 

CDL has also been a pioneer winner for a number of 

our developments. To date, 14 of our buildings have 

been certified as “Water Efficient Buildings” by PUB 

for outstanding efforts in water conservation.

Due to the higher water usage for the development 

projects nearing completion in 2015, our water use at 

construction sites increased by about 20% compared 

to 2014. 

To better manage our water use, CDL has established 

targets in 2015 to reduce water use intensity by 22% 

by 2020 and 25% by 2030, with 2007 as baseline 

year. We have so far achieved a 17% reduction in 

2015, with more initiatives to be put in place to 

achieve our target in 2020.

NATURAL CAPITAL

WASTE AND RESOURCE 

MANAGEMENT

Waste generation, treatment and disposal have 

significant environmental impacts. Waste breakdown 

in landfills contribute to carbon emissions and 

leachates may contaminate groundwater and 

waterways, while incineration causes pollution issues 

and affects air quality. 

CDL remains steadfast in managing our waste 

efficiently and seeks to reduce, reuse, and recycle 

our waste whenever feasible. As a property 

developer and manager, the bulk of our waste is 

generated by our builders and commercial tenants. 

Unless reused, demolition at the end of a building’s 

life cycle can produce significant waste for land 

disposal. Here are some ways we practise the 3Rs – 

Reduce, Reuse and Recycle in waste management:

Note: 2015’s waste intensity figure for 15 CDL construction sites in 

Singapore are based on the built gross floor area for the projects in 2015.

In land-scarce Singapore, most general waste is 

sent to the waste-to-energy incineration plants. 

Incineration plants are capable of reducing the solid 

waste volume by 90%, and the incinerated ash is 

then transported to the landfill for disposal. Mindful 

that construction debris cannot be incinerated and 

are directly sent to the landfill, we are spurred to 

continuously invest in, innovate, and adopt leading-

edge technology such as PPVC to significantly reduce 

construction waste. 

All of CDL’s generated waste is non-hazardous and 

disposed of in accordance with the NEA’s waste 

regulations. In 2015, construction waste generated 

at all CDL construction sites amounted to 13,906 

tonnes or 66.2kg/m2. This is higher than the previous 

years as many of our construction projects in 2015 

were in the intensive building stage where greater 

volume of waste is expected.

Waste Recycling at CDL Commercial Buildings

In CDL-managed buildings, 1,057 tonnes of 

paper was recycled in 2015. Our paper recycling 

programme has seen increasing tenant participation 

from 68% in 2005 to 94% in 2015. Under the lamp 

recycling programme with Global Lamp Recyclers, 

14,459 lamps were recycled in 2015. 

Paper Consumption at CDL Corporate Office

The main source of waste generated at CDL Corporate 

Office is paper. To conserve forest resources, CDL 

has steadily reduced the use of paper over the years 

through usage monitoring, setting double-sided 

printing by default and encouraging electronic 

publications.

Responsible Material Use 

and Green Procurement

CDL understands that the development and 

management of buildings accounts for large 

quantities of material usage and waste. We therefore 

focus on material selection, specification, and 

construction management as ways to reduce the 

overall impact of our projects across their life-cycle. 

We acknowledge that the use of virgin materials 

can impact the environment and human health. 

By specifying the use of sustainable and healthy 

building materials in our developments, we are 

able to deliver tangible environmental, social, and 

business benefits.

Beyond our operations, CDL has also implemented 

a set of green procurement guidelines to promote 

responsible sourcing along our supply chain since 

2008. Aligned with our corporate EHS Policy, the 

guidelines encourage the use of eco-friendly and 

recycled materials. An example is the use of non-

toxic materials like low volatile organic compounds 

paint. All our builders, suppliers and vendors of new 

development projects are subject to these guidelines. 

The top five building materials that were used 

in construction for the three developments that 

achieved TOP status in 2015 are: granite (209,714 

tonnes), sand (146,639 tonnes), cement (73,231 

tonnes), rebar and steelworks (26,254 tonnes), and 

granite or marble tiles (6,881 tonnes). In one of 

the projects, the H2O Residences, more than 30% 

of building materials used consisted of recycled 

content that were from low carbon sources, or were 

certified by recognised environmental organisations. 

The materials include premixed concrete, drywall 

partition, and laminate flooring.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION

Investing in Environmental Protection

Testament to our commitment to environmental 

conservation, CDL has established a minimum target 

for all new developments to be certified BCA Green 

Mark GoldPLUS, beyond legislative requirements. To 

support this ambition, CDL currently invests between 

2% and 5% of a new development’s construction 

cost on green design and features, mitigating the 

environmental impacts of our buildings.

CDL also contributes to various non-governmental 

and grassroots organisations such as the Singapore 

Environment Council and Nature Society (Singapore), 

as well as youth-led environmental groups in support 

of their eco-outreach and education initiatives that 

drive environmental conversation and sustainability 

within the wider community. In 2015, CDL pledged 

to donate $100,000 to the North West Community 

Development Council’s “Power Up Scheme”. More 

details can be found on page 75.

More information on CDL’s partnerships and 

community investment in environmental conservation 

programmes can be found on pages 73 to 76.

NATURAL CAPITAL

Protecting Biodiversity and Natural Habitats

Property development is a key business activity 

for CDL and this presents both challenges and 

opportunities in environmental management. 

We develop new land for housing, including 

infrastructure and social amenities to create 

sustainable, thriving communities. Developments on 

greenfield sites can impact ecological communities, 

and protected or significant species. 

As Singapore is highly urbanised, densely populated 

and land scarce, the Government views optimal 

land use planning as a crucial aspect of our nation’s 

sustainable development. All of CDL’s development 

projects are within the land allocated by the Urban 

Redevelopment Authority (URA) for home and 

commercial use and hence, none are located within 

protected areas. With proper planning by URA, the 

forests in Singapore are not commercially exploited 

for timber or other resources.

As an environmentally responsible developer, we 

are firmly rooted in minimising and mitigating the 

impacts of our developments on the natural habitats 

of wildlife and protecting the biodiversity of the 

surrounding environments. We appreciate that 

preserving biodiversity enhances the liveability and 

vitality of our communities in the long run. 

We make it a standard practice to conduct a 

Biodiversity Impact Assessment (BIA) at our sites 

during the planning stage, where applicable. BIA helps 

to determine if any plant or animal life of national 

conservation importance exists at the intended 

development site and makes recommendations for 

environmental mitigation if necessary. 

For the Brownstone EC which is located in an area of 

woodland and open fields, specialists were engaged to 

conduct a BIA onsite. The two-day field survey found 

70 species of plants, 11 species of butterflies and 35 

species of birds, of which three species – Long-tailed 

Parakeet, Changeable Hawk Eagle, and Grey Heron –

were considered to be of conservation importance.

The development of the site is not expected to have a 

significant impact on the overall health of the natural 

populations of these bird species, as they would be 

able to find foraging and roosting sites in similar 

habitats nearby.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE 

CDL is committed to comply with all applicable 

legal requirements enforced by local governing 

authorities such as BCA, NEA, Ministry of 

Manpower (MOM), Singapore Civil Defence Force 

and other relevant enforcers. Through constant 

monitoring, evaluation, and auditing of our certified 

EHS management system, CDL actively ensures that 

all our activities and operations comply with existing 

regulatory requirements.

In 2015, 16 fines were imposed on our builders 

across 15 construction sites and three other fines were 

for our commercial buildings. Nine were for vector 

breeding, one for working beyond allowable hours, five 

for performing construction activities above the noise 

limit and one for safety infringement. Three stop work 

orders were received from NEA for mosquito breeding 

and one stop work order was received from MOM for

To prevent future occurrences of non-compliance, 

we have reviewed and streamlined our current 

processes to improve and tighten the procedures at 

construction sites. Since 2005, we have incentivised 

our builders to uphold high EHS standards through 

the CDL 5-Star EHS Awards and monetary rewards. 

From 2013, a penalty system has been imposed 

on builders of all new developments for any EHS 

infringements. This was formulated as part of an 

ongoing review of our system and process to maintain 

good EHS performance.

To address public enquiries or complaints on EHS 

matters, phone hotlines managed by our builders 

were set-up at all construction sites. 

Managing Construction Noise

In Singapore, NEA regulates the noise levels from 

construction sites, with a set of permissible noise 

limits that vary depending on the time of the day and 

neighbouring premises. To protect nearby residents, 

we place emphasis on our builders to comply with 

the construction noise limits at all our construction 

sites. To minimise noise-related complaints, our 

builders are encouraged to put in place an active 

management programme and to take all necessary 

action to address and resolve related complaints. 

As part of efforts to keep the community informed 

about project statuses, schedules of the construction 

process at each site are communicated to the 

community, to pre-empt them about the works 

that might affect them. More details on our public 

communications can be found on page 65. 

MOVING FORWARD

In line with Singapore’s goal of becoming a climate 

resilient city and the growing international focus on 

low-carbon economies, CDL has adopted the Sectoral 

Decarbonisation Approach to review our carbon 

emission targets. This revision will align our targets 

with the COP21 Paris Agreement to keep the global 

temperature rise this century well below two degrees 

Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

With effect from 2016, we have also set a target 

for 35% of our building materials to be derived 

from recycled content, low-carbon sources or those 

certified by recognised environmental organisations.

To minimise the onsite environmental impact of our 

construction activities, CDL will be embarking on 

an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for an 

upcoming development site. Compared to a BIA, an 

EIA offers a more comprehensive assessment of our 

construction activities’ impact onsite. Beyond this 

pilot, we will continue to study the application of EIA 

for CDL’s future developments.

MANUFACTURED CAPITAL

INNOVATE

FOR SMART  

GREEN SPACES


MANUFACTURED CAPITAL

Creating quality spaces for people to live, work and 

play in lies at the heart of CDL’s business. Building 

on our expertise and experience as a pioneer 

developer since 1963, strategic efforts have been 

put in place to enhance CDL’s brand and product 

differentiation. This helps us sharpen our competitive 

edge in an intensely competitive market. Our quality, 

innovative and green spaces have strengthened our 

manufactured capital, enabling us to create greater 

value for our customers and investors.

Over the years, our green building efforts have 

translated to tangible benefits for not only CDL, but 

also our homebuyers and tenants. Between 2008 

and 2015, 57 of our Green Mark certified buildings 

achieved energy savings of more than $31 million. 

This includes savings passed on to homebuyers and 

tenants from our buildings’ green features. 

For over a decade, the Company has been investing 

between 2% and 5% of a new development’s 

construction cost on green building design and 

features. Our promise to deliver quality green homes 

and commercial spaces was re-affirmed when CDL 

was awarded the Quality Excellence Award – Quality 

Champion (Platinum) by the BCA in 2015, earning 

us the distinction of being the only developer to have 

received this highest honour for three consecutive 

years. 

As at end 2015, CDL has over 80* BCA Green Mark 

developments and office interiors – the highest 

among Singapore developers. Besides tangible cost 

and resource savings, our pursuit of green building 

has built a strong reputation for CDL and generated 

goodwill amongst our stakeholders. 

For the full list of CDL’s Green Mark awarded 

developments and office interiors, please refer to 

page 60 and 61.

VALUE OF GREEN BUILDINGS

Our commitment to sustainable development has 

gained traction as the business case for green 

investments becomes increasingly evident. According 

to the BCA Building Energy Benchmarking Report 

20151, certified green buildings have continued 

to outperform non-certified buildings in terms of 

electricity savings by as much as 15% for offices and 

10% for retail properties.

We proactively adopt sustainable construction 

methods and integrate innovative technologies 

to enhance the environmental performance and 

financial value of our properties, as well as create 

comfortable green homes. To optimise resource 

and cost-savings, sustainability considerations are 

factored into the entire lifecycle of our developments, 

starting from land acquisition and design to 

construction and building management.

Our leadership approach towards green buildings 

has also allowed CDL to stay ahead and seize 

opportunities arising from emerging regulatory 

changes. Since 2011, CDL has set a minimum target 

for all its new developments to be certified BCA 

Green Mark2 GoldPLUS, beyond the mandatory Green 

Mark certification level. Today, close to 70% of CDL’s 

portfolio of Green Mark certified developments and 

office interiors are rated Green Mark GoldPLUS and 

Platinum – the highest tier certification. 

Besides complementing BCA’s national target of 

greening at least 80% of Singapore’s building 

stock by 2030, our steadfast commitment to green 

buildings has strengthened our licence to operate 

and earned CDL the priceless reputation as the built 

industry leader. 

Testament to our relentless pursuit of green building 

excellence, CDL’s Tree House condominium topped 

the Sustainable Development category at the FIABCI 

World Prix d’Excellence Awards 2015, winning us 

the World Gold award. Conferred by an international 

panel comprising real estate professionals and 

experts, the award recognises Tree House’s eco-

inspired design and energy-saving green features.

2 Developed by BCA in 2005, the Green Mark rating is the national assessment system of green building performance based on key areas of energy 

efficiency, water efficiency, environmental protection, indoor environment quality and green features and innovation. Certified Green Mark build-

ings are re-assessed once every three years to determine if they maintain the Green Mark status.

55


MANUFACTURED CAPITAL

Tree House is home to one of the world’s largest 

vertical gardens, holding the Guinness World Record 

from April 2014 to June 2015. At 24-storeys tall, 

the garden provides natural insulation and lowers the 

energy needed to cool indoor spaces. It also helps to 

filter pollutants from the air. 

According to a 2015 study by the National University 

of Singapore (NUS), the 48 west-facing bedrooms 

insulated by the vertical garden are expected to 

achieve air-conditioning energy savings of close to  

98,000 kWh/year or about $21,0003 in electricity 

savings annually.

Retrofitting Existing Buildings

Besides new property developments, CDL has set 

the pace for greening our existing buildings. A 2015 

study by BCA1 on 83 retrofitted buildings revealed 

an average total annual electricity savings of 16%, 

equivalent to about $41 million in savings each year.

Since 2006, CDL has retrofitted all our existing 

commercial and industrial buildings by upgrading 

chiller plants, introducing motion sensors, installing 

energy-efficient lighting, and recladding facades. On 

average, these efforts have yielded estimated annual 

energy savings of around 14 million kWh, equivalent 

to more than $3 million in 2015. These initiatives 

contributed to the Green Mark Platinum certification 

for 10 of our commercial buildings which have 

demonstrated improvements in environmental 

performance during the re-certification process. 

For more details on CDL’s energy management initiatives 

in 2015, please refer to page 45 in Natural Capital. 

Green Lease and User Engagement

Mindful that tenant and occupant activities within 

a building can account for close to 50%4 of the 

total electricity consumption of a building, CDL’s 

efforts go beyond green infrastructure to proactive 

steps to promote eco-friendly behaviour amongst 

our tenants. Since 2014, we have implemented the 

CDL Green Lease Partnership Programme to support 

our commercial tenants in reducing their energy 

consumption and environmental footprint. 

A dedicated team of Green Lease ambassadors guide 

tenants on ‘greening’ their offices by giving advice 

on indoor greenery, as well as energy and water 

conservation measures. The team of ambassadors 

also act as consultants to help tenants achieve the 

BCA Green Mark Office Interior certification.

To enable tenants to better control and manage their 

energy usage, a real-time digital energy monitoring 

portal was launched in partnership with Tuas Power 

in 2014. As an incentive to encourage greater energy 

conservation amongst our tenants, CDL further 

introduced a 1% electricity rebate for commercial 

tenants who attain 2% savings over the previous 

quarter’s bill. As of March 2016, over 90% of our 

existing tenants have pledged their commitment to the 

CDL Green Lease Partnership Programme by signing a 

Green Lease Memorandum of Understanding. 

In recognition of CDL’s sterling efforts and success in 

engaging our tenants on environmental sustainability, 

CDL was conferred three out of seven of the inaugural 

Green Mark Pearl Awards given during the BCA Awards 

2015 – the biggest winner of this new category. CDL’s 

City House also emerged as the sole winner of the 

top tier Green Mark Pearl Prestige Award for actively 

engaging with our tenants to use less energy through 

changes in behaviour and daily operations.

DELIVERING QUALITY 

GREEN SPACES

The quality of our developments determines how well 

we perform in the marketplace. We recognise that 

each property purchase is a significant investment 

for our customers and we make it a priority to deliver 

on innovative green designs, high standards of 

workmanship, and buildability, without compromising 

on functionality or price. 

Established in 1989, the BCA Construction Quality 

Assessment System (CONQUAS)5 has been the 

industry benchmark for quality and workmanship 

standards of construction projects in Singapore. 

Although it is not mandatory for private sector 

projects to subscribe to CONQUAS, CDL has 

consistently made efforts to submit all its projects 

for assessment since the inception of the system. 

As a seal of our commitment to the highest quality 

standards, 368 Thomson became the first project 

to be awarded the CONQUAS STAR6 rating under 

its eighth edition. Six out of the top ten private 

residential projects in the 2015 CONQUAS ranking 

were developed by CDL.

For three years in a row, CDL has also been 

accorded BCA’s top honours for the Quality 

Excellence Award – Quality Champion (Platinum) 

for our sustained leadership and commitment to 

delivering quality homes. 

EMBRACING INCLUSIVITY THROUGH 

UNIVERSAL DESIGN

CDL stands firm in the principle of ‘designing for all 

people’ in all our projects. We do this over and above 

the minimum requirements specified in the Code on 

Barrier-Free Accessibility by BCA.

In 2015, Blossom Residences, 368 Thomson,

The Glyndebourne, and Buckley Classique were

recognised with the BCA Universal Design Mark Gold

Award for imbuing user-centric philosophy into its

design, operations, and maintenance. In addition, 

Coco Palms and The Venue Residences and Shoppes 

received the Universal Design Mark rating of GoldPLUS 

and Gold for its design respectively.

5 BCA CONQUAS is a de facto national standard assessment system on the quality of buildings based on three areas of Structural Works, Architectural 

Works and Mechanical &amp; Electrical Works. 

6 BCA CONQUAS STAR is accorded to a project that has attained a CONQUAS score of at least 95 points.

PIONEERING SUSTAINABLE 

BUILDING INNOVATION

As Singapore’s third largest contributor of carbon 

emissions, the built sector consumes up to 37% of 

electricity7 and employs close to 326,000 foreign 

workers8. As part of our long-term strategy for 

environmental and supply chain management, CDL 

has invested in sustainable and more productive 

methods of building against the challenges of skilled 

labour shortage and rising cost of resources. 

Driving Productivity through Technologies 

For the upcoming The Brownstone Executive 

Condominium (EC), CDL became the first developer in 

Asia to apply the advanced construction technology, 

Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction 

(PPVC), for a large-scale residential development 

comprising 638 apartment units. Likely the world’s 

largest application of PPVC for a residential project, 

some 5,000 building modules will be used. Apart 

from mitigating environmental impacts onsite, this 

technology is expected to raise productivity by over 

40%, saving some 55,000 man-days. 

Testament to the marketability of our innovative and 

green developments, The Brownstone emerged as 

the bestselling EC in 2015. The ground-breaking 

PPVC technology follows CDL’s success in the early 

adoption of the Prefabricated Bathroom Units (PBUs). 

The use of PBUs improves construction productivity 

by up to 80% and reduces construction waste while 

improving water tightness of the bathrooms. To date, 

CDL has installed more than 10,000 PBUs in our 

residential developments.

Since 2000’s, CDL has also pioneered the use 

of drywalls which are easy to install and improve 

productivity compared with the conventional 

brickwall system.

For our efforts, all three Platinum accolades in 

the Projects category of the BCA Construction 

Productivity Awards 2015 were awarded to CDL’s 

developments.

Innovating for a Smart and Liveable City 

Since 2001, CDL has embarked on integrated smart-

home solutions, starting with the introduction of the 

intelligent, interactive, and internet-ready i-Home 

concept for The Equatorial condominium. Over the 

years, we have continued to innovate and introduce 

smart-home features in our residential developments, 

creating living spaces that will improve on the quality 

of life and support Singapore’s position as a leading 

international Smart City. 

Smart solutions are also introduced at CDL-managed 

commercial and retail buildings. Some of our smart 

initiatives are detailed on the next page.

SOCIAL AND RELATIONSHIP CAPITAL

INSPIRE

STAKEHOLDERS TO BUILD 

A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE


SOCIAL AND RELATIONSHIP CAPITAL

At CDL, we view social and relationship capital 

as the stock of resources created by the goodwill 

forged with our stakeholders and within the local 

and international communities that we operate in. To 

continuously build trust, we consistently manage our 

stakeholder relations through various platforms where 

we can mutually communicate views and concerns. 

Our sustainable business model and strong track 

record of being an eco-developer and responsible 

corporate citizen have not only allowed us to 

attract like-minded partners and investors, but 

also a growing pool of consumers who consider 

sustainability more of an imperative than a value-

add. The trust we have built with stakeholders 

beyond our shores also helps us gain foothold as we 

expand our international footprint. Strengthening 

our social and relationship capital is now even more 

essential and has far-reaching business impact 

beyond retaining our social licence to operate. 

Anticipating and meeting the needs of our 

stakeholders is thus of utmost importance. As such, 

we invest considerable resources in building strategic 

collaborations with organisations from the Public, 

Private and People (3P) sectors to create greater 

value for our business and the community. 

We define our stakeholders as groups that our 

business has a significant impact on and those 

with a vested interest in our operations. Our key 

stakeholders include employees, customers, builders 

and suppliers, and investors. Other groups include 

regulators and key government agencies, non-

governmental organisations (NGOs), the media, and 

our community-at-large. They are mapped into groups 

based on their impact on the Company as detailed on 

page 15. Stakeholders’ issues of interest are outlined 

on pages 64 to 65. 

The trust we have built with stakeholders beyond our shores also helps us gain 

foothold as we expand our international footprint. Strengthening our social and 

relationship capital is now even more essential and has far-reaching business 

impact beyond retaining our social licence to operate.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Employees

Our employees are the key drivers of organisational 

knowledge and innovation – these are vital to 

building our competitive advantage. Consistent 

engagement of employees forms the foundation 

of CDL’s long-term strategy for human capital 

development. Our initiatives to recruit and retain 

employees and develop their competencies are 

addressed in the Human Capital section, from pages 

80 to 87. The following sections will focus more on 

our key internal staff engagement initiatives.

Regular Communication and Survey

CDL conducts an Employee Engagement Survey 

biennially to measure employee satisfaction and 

gather feedback. The survey provides insights into 

employee-related concerns including training and 

development, pay and benefits, as well as employee 

engagement and empowerment. 

Our Company intranet – CDL 360, was upgraded in 

2013 to provide an interactive platform for employees 

to receive and share information more readily and 

promptly, and includes key information such as 

employment terms, benefits, and corporate policies. 

Through regular communication sessions such as 

dialogue with Senior Management, Meet-the-CEO 

sessions, and internal platforms comprising various 

working committees, CDL ensures that employees’ 

views are always heard. Through the dissemination of 

City News, daily news bulletins, e-posters of employee 

activities, CSR News, webcasts of financial results 

briefings and Annual General Meetings, as well as 

employee circulars, employees are informed of the 

Company’s business developments and activities.  

For more information, please refer to page 29.

Managing Employee Grievances

CDL has in place policies to address employee 

grievances in a prompt, fair, and impartial manner. 

Employees are guided by the Code of Business 

Conduct and Ethics, and the Whistle-Blowing Policy.

The latter deals with and protects the confidentiality 

of employees who whistle-blow on the Company’s 

accounting, financial reporting, internal controls, and 

auditing matters.

Our Employee Grievance Handling Policy includes a 

comprehensive and structured three-stage procedure. 

Employees can escalate their grievances first to 

their immediate supervisor or HOD, followed by the 

HR Department. If the grievance is still unresolved, 

a Board of Inquiry consisting of the Group General 

Manager, a HR representative, and a neutral member 

of Senior Management will investigate and propose a 

final resolution. All discussions are documented in a 

Grievance Lodge Form and a follow-up report.

Advocating Greener Employee Lifestyles

To promote greener habits among employees, CDL 

organises regular in-house environment-related 

talks and activities, with various lifestyle angles and 

hands-on components. 

In 2015, we registered an employee participation 

rate of about 60% for our green-related activities, 

an increase from 40% in 2014. This is based on 

attendance across activities such as an Earth Hour 

movie screening, a microgreen workshop, and a talk 

on Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle (3R) practices. 

Customers

We believe that our financial viability hinges on 

customer satisfaction and our ability to meet 

customer demand for our products and service. As 

such, CDL regularly engages with homebuyers and 

tenants to understand their concerns and needs. 

Delivering Exceptional Customer Experience

CDL was the first property developer to set up an 

integrated customer and call centre in 2001. We 

believe that word-of-mouth is one of the primary 

factors behind purchasing decisions and customers 

who receive a positive experience from us will 

become our brand advocates. From the moment 

they step into a CDL show suite to the handover 

of their keys, we aim to provide the support that 

SOCIAL AND RELATIONSHIP CAPITAL

66


homebuyers require to make their purchasing 

process a pleasant one. Customers can easily 

contact us through various channels, mainly the 

hotline, site offices, and our website.

Customer-specific information on the progress 

status of projects under construction and related 

correspondence are also available on a secured 

online platform. There is also a structured approach 

to reviewing feedback and resolving complaints. 

Follow-up actions are then closely monitored and 

reviewed regularly at inter-departmental meetings.

Engaging Homebuyers on Sustainable Living 

CDL was the first private-sector property developer 

to launch an environmental outreach programme 

for homebuyers in March 2004. Following the 

attainment of the development’s TOP, a special 

Welcome Party is organised for homebuyers. The 

Party comprises a host of activities, including talks 

and exhibitions on environmental conservation to 

encourage homebuyers to adopt greener lifestyles. 

Apart from a sneak peek of their new estate, 

homebuyers also receive a special Green Living Kit 

containing information on the eco-friendly features of 

their new homes, green living tips, and eco-friendly 

gifts. In 2015, close to 1,900 Green Living kits were 

distributed and the average satisfaction rate for the 

“Let’s Live Green!” talks and exhibition was 67%.

Moving forward, CDL will expand the eco-gift ideas to 

support the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint 2015’s 

goals of turning Singapore into a smarter and more 

sustainable city. 

Measuring Customer Satisfaction to 

Improve Service Delivery

To improve our service delivery, CDL reviews customer 

satisfaction through formalised surveys. Our target 

is to achieve a 70% satisfaction rate from our 

homebuyers. For tenants, we aim to attain a satisfaction 

rate of 80% for our office/retail tenants and 70% for 

industrial tenants. 

For homebuyers, an online customer satisfaction 

survey is administered at least six months after 

handover of the new apartment to measure their 

experience across various touch points and to 

solicit feedback and suggestions on project design, 

apartment features, as well as facilities and amenities.

Tenants at CDL’s commercial properties are also 

surveyed annually. Through feedback, we can better 

understand customers’ expectations and identify gaps 

for continual improvements. Some of our product 

refinement and service engagement initiatives have 

originated from customer feedback. 

For example, progressive upgrading of toilets has been 

in the pipeline following feedback from tenants of City 

Industrial Building. To cater to the needs of a tenant 

whose clients are predominantly wheelchair bound, 

plans have also been made for one of the ground floor 

toilets to be converted to a handicap-friendly one. At 

City Square Mall, sustainable solutions to improve 

toilets with high usage have also been implemented. 

Such upgrading initiatives have helped to enhance the 

value and marketability of the properties.

In 2015, customer satisfaction surveys were 

conducted for four of our residential developments 

and 34.6% of homebuyers participated. Our 

homebuyers were surveyed on levels of satisfaction 

with their entire experience, ranging from a property’s 

finishes and workmanship, overall construction 

quality, green features provided in the home, 

facilities and landscaping at common areas, and 

management of defects rectification.

The average satisfaction level amongst all 

homebuyers surveyed was 60% in 2015. Over the 

years, we have noticed that the expectations of 

homebuyers have increased, particularly in finishes 

and workmanship.

Apart from existing homebuyers, CDL also solicits 

feedback from potential homebuyers who visit our 

project show suites. Respondents’ feedback on the 

quality and finishes of the show suites, apartment 

configuration preferences, and service standards, 

are invaluable to our design refinement and project 

planning process.

As part of the quality assurance process, 

homebuyers are provided with a Defects Notification 

Form during handover of new apartments to provide 

feedback on defects in their unit. Defects reported 

are rectified within 30 days, where possible.

The progress of rectification is tracked closely and as 

at 31 December 2015, 77% of defects reported were 

rectified within 30 days. 66% of homebuyers also 

indicated that they would recommend CDL properties 

to their friends and relatives. 

As a result of our Customer Service Department’s 

attention to detail in rectifying defects, we have 

received positive feedback from homebuyers 

complimenting staff for their high service standards. 

SPOTLIGHT

Electronic Defect Management System

In 2015, the Customer Service Department 

implemented an electronic defects 

management system. With this system, 

homeowners are able to lodge unit defects, 

track, and acknowledge defect rectification

Safeguarding Customer Privacy

CDL protects the privacy and confidentiality of 

our customers’ information. In addition to internal 

policies and procedures designed to safeguard 

customer information, CDL does not divulge or 

sell such personal information to third parties for 

marketing or promotional purposes. Our approach to 

personal data management is spelt out in the CDL 

Personal Data Policy which is publicly accessible on 

our website and outlined on page 32. 

All employees are guided by CDL’s Code of Business 

Conduct and Ethics, and the Company will mete out 

strict disciplinary action for any breach of customer 

confidentiality. In 2015, there were zero complaints 

regarding breach of customer privacy or loss of 

customer data.

Engaging Tenant on Resource Efficiency 

Findings from the BCA Building Energy Benchmarking 

Report 2015 have shown that tenant electricity usage 

accounts for 48% and 50% of electricity consumption 

in office and retail buildings respectively. To support 

our commercial tenants’ efforts in reducing their 

energy consumption and environmental footprint, 

we implemented the CDL Green Lease Partnership 

Programme in 2014. A digital energy monitoring 

portal was jointly developed with Tuas Power to enable 

our tenants to better manage their energy usage.

In addition to the “green fit-out” guide issued to all 

tenants, we created a dedicated team of CDL Green 

Lease ambassadors to guide tenants on how they 

can create more environmentally-friendly premises 

by adopting sustainable designs, materials, fittings, 

equipment, and lighting fixtures. More importantly, 

the ambassadors helped identify energy-saving 

opportunities to lower tenants’ operating costs. 

As of March 2016, more than 90% of our existing 

tenants signed a Green Lease Memorandum of 

Understanding as part of lease renewal. CDL aims 

to achieve a 100% participation in our Green Lease 

Partnership Programme for both new and renewal 

agreements. 

A number of our tenants have also taken their green 

journey a step further by achieving the Green Mark 

Office Interior certification. In recognition of CDL’s 

sterling efforts in engaging its tenants to go green, 

BCA conferred CDL with three out of seven Green 

Mark Pearl Awards in 2015. CDL is the biggest 

winner of this new category. CDL was also the sole 

winner of the top-tier Pearl Prestige Award for 

outstanding commercial tenant engagement efforts. 

For more information, please refer to page 56.

Protecting our Tenants’ Health, Safety and Security

As a responsible facility manager, CDL actively 

identifies the significant hazards and manages the 

risks in all CDL-managed commercial buildings. A 

range of measures are in place to ensure public safety 

and security. Current security and loss prevention 

processes include traditional security measures of 

monitoring (CCTV and security guards), supplemented 

by emergency management procedures that are 

subject to continual review and improvement. 

To ensure tenants’ safety and security, every 

building is under the care of a Complex Manager 

who oversees daily operations with a team of full-

time service providers, including security firms, 

providing 24-hour coverage.

For each building, there is an Emergency Response 

Plan (ERP) for known building-related emergencies 

such as flu epidemic outbreaks, fires, and major 

electricity outages. In view of Singapore’s climate 

change risk, a flood management response plan for 

commercial buildings has been put in place since 

2012. Besides two mandatory fire drills and two 

table-top exercises annually, CDL also conducts 

flood drills and other exercises to further enhance 

the preparedness at our buildings. With the threat 

of terrorism increasing significantly in the region, 

CDL is enhancing the current ERP to prepare for and 

respond to terrorist threats. 

Since 2014, CDL has been organising complimentary 

health-screenings for tenants at selected commercial 

buildings to provide them with the convenience of 

having the checks conducted at their workplace. 

69


Builders and Suppliers

CDL proactively influences and engages with key 

stakeholders in our value chain to embrace safe 

and environmentally-friendly designs as well as 

operational best practices throughout the life cycle  

of our buildings.

Managing EHS along the Value Chain

When awarding a contract, CDL places considerable 

emphasis on the EHS culture and track record of 

suppliers and contractors. In key operations like 

project development and property management, 

major suppliers and builders shall meet the EHS 

pre-qualification criteria of appropriate bizSAFE 

certification. Almost 100% of the consultants and 

builders of CDL’s developments in 2015 obtained 

both ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certifications.

Since 2008, CDL has voluntarily committed itself as 

a founding signatory to the ‘Pledge for Zero – A CEO 

Commitment Charter’, an initiative by the Workplace 

Safety and Health Council. In 2010, we amplified 

our efforts by inviting our builders and consultants 

to collectively pledge their commitment to raise EHS 

standards at the construction sites. 

At the 10th anniversary of the CDL 5-Star EHS 

Awards in 2014, a special event was held to engage 

CDL builders and their workers. Nine builders, 

which collectively employed over 6,000 construction 

workers across 16 CDL construction sites, signed 

a pledge to re-affirm their commitment to uphold 

workers’ well-being, safety and health.

Measuring Performance through CDL 5-Star  

EHS Assessment System

Since 2001, the CDL 5-Star EHS Assessment 

System – an independent audit tool to assess, 

measure, and improve the builders’ EHS 

management and performance, was put in place to 

ensure a comprehensive, audited, and appraised 

EHS approach. All CDL builders undergo quarterly 

EHS inspections and audits conducted by an 

independent EHS audit firm recognised by MOM, 

and are appraised on a scale of one to five stars. 

Results are then presented to the management 

and site supervisors of the builders and project 

consultants during the quarterly CDL 5-Star EHS 

Seminars. These seminars promote sharing of best 

practices and peer learning to encourage better EHS 

performance amongst the builders. 

In 2005, the CDL 5-Star EHS Awards was introduced 

to recognise builders who have excelled in the CDL 

5-Star EHS Assessment System over a one-year 

period. The Assessment System and Awards have 

been instrumental in influencing CDL’s builders 

and consultants to monitor and improve their EHS 

performance.

The Awards comprise the CDL EHS Excellence Award 

and the CDL Productivity Excellence Award, which 

was introduced in 2011 in support of Singapore’s 

national productivity drive. In 2012, the CDL 

Workers’ Welfare Award was introduced as part of our 

continuous efforts to align business practices with  

ISO 26000. To recognise exemplary workers who live 

the safety message and inspire fellow colleagues to 

be more safety-conscious, the Safe Worker Award was 

launched in 2014. 

In the same year, we launched the CDL EHS Cup 

soccer league with the aim of promoting a healthy 

lifestyle and fostering camaraderie amongst our 

builders’ workers. The league received favourable 

response and was held again in 2015. 

Upholding Workers’ Welfare and Well-Being

Even though the workforce of builders does not come 

directly under CDL’s supervision, their welfare and 

well-being are a priority to us. With that, we have put in 

place measures to ensure that our operations and that 

of our significant suppliers are not involved in unethical 

labour practices such as child or forced labour.

While onsite workers’ housing is not encouraged, we 

accept that there may be circumstances under which 

this is necessary. As such, following the issuance 

of our Corporate Statement on Human Rights in 

2012, workers’ housing conditions was subsequently 

included in the CDL 5-Star EHS Assessment System, 

where applicable, after a trial run and refinement 

of criteria. The current assessment criteria follows 

requirements mandated by relevant government 

SOCIAL AND RELATIONSHIP CAPITAL

70


agencies and goes beyond local compliance1 to ensure 

that in instances where there are onsite workers’ 

housing, workers are treated with dignity and respect. 

Workers’ dormitories and facilities have to meet the 

minimum requirements stipulated in our guidelines.

CDL’s appointed builders are expected to exceed 

compliance of local labour laws. They are responsible 

for taking all necessary measures to provide safe, 

clean, and dignified living and working conditions, 

without risks to the workers’ health. For instance, 

vector and pest control programmes must be in 

place, and site offices and toilets must be equipped 

with basic amenities such as electricity, water, 

adequate lighting, and proper ventilation.

In our selection of consultants and suppliers, we place 

considerable emphasis on their EHS culture and track 

record. Upon their appointment, the top management 

of these qualified firms pledge their EHS commitment, 

which also serves as a further reminder for them to 

work with CDL to ensure high EHS standards at our 

projects.

In 2015, there were zero incidents and grievances 

of child and forced labour being reported at CDL 

construction sites and managed buildings. 

For more information on CDL’s position on Human 

Rights, please refer to page 80.

Investors and Analysts

Businesses worldwide are impacted by the growing 

demand for transparency and accountability, 

including increasingly stringent requirements for 

sustainability reporting. Apart from growing company 

earnings and maximising shareholder returns, CDL 

prioritises quality and timely communication of our 

ESG performance to engage investors and analysts.

As an affirmation of our sustainability efforts and 

commitment to ESG tracking, disclosure, and 

reporting, CDL has been ranked the Top Real Estate 

Company and Top 10 in the prestigious Global 

100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World in 

2016. For two consecutive years since the Channel 

NewsAsia Ranking was launched in 2014, CDL 

1 Local legislations mandate that quarters on construction sites have to meet the technical requirements of relevant government agencies, such as 

Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), National Environment Agency (NEA) and BCA, to ensure safe and hygienic living conditions. More details 

can be found at www.mom.gov.sg.

has also been named Asia’s Top Property Developer 

and Top Singapore Company. We remain the first 

Singapore corporation to be listed on three of 

the world’s leading sustainability benchmarks – 

FTSE4Good Index Series (since 2002), Global 100 

(since 2010), and Dow Jones Sustainability Indices 

(since 2011). Please refer to pages 38 to 39 for our 

performance across key global benchmarks.

Our Senior Management holds briefings with 

analysts and the media on CDL’s half-year and 

full-year financial results. Financial statements and 

presentation slides are also available on SGXNET and 

CDL’s website. A live webcast was also made available 

for our FY2015 results announcement. CDL also 

ensures that shareholders are notified of all material 

information in an accurate and timely manner.

In addition, the Senior Management takes an active 

role in investor relations, meeting local and foreign 

fund managers regularly as well as participating in 

local and overseas roadshows and conferences.

Government Agencies and Regulators

Feedback and Experience-Sharing

Participation in stakeholder consultations organised 

by key government agencies provides us with 

opportunities to weigh in on proposed regulatory 

changes that impact our business. Apart from 

cushioning the Company from the cost of regulatory 

alignment, engaging regulators and relevant industry 

bodies has enabled CDL to be attuned to industry 

challenges, placing us in a better position to capture 

existing and future opportunities for growth.

CDL is committed to full compliance with 

regulations. Our robust policies and procedures 

ensure that all our activities and operations comply 

with existing regulatory requirements through 

constant monitoring, evaluation, and auditing of our 

EHS management systems.

Over the years, CDL has been recognised as 

an example for best practices in sustainability, 

innovation, and productivity through our use of 

technologies that have gone beyond compliance.

Going Beyond Compliance

Regulatory Changes

CDL – Ahead of the Curve

Sustainability Reporting:

The Sustainability Reporting 

consultation paper released 

by the SGX in January 2016 

proposed for companies to 

include a Board Statement 

in their Sustainability 

Report. 

Ahead of SGX’s “comply or explain” approach towards sustainability reporting 

which will take effect in 2017, CDL was the first Singapore organisation to 

produce a GRI-checked sustainability report in 2008. To align ourselves with 

SGX’s proposed guidelines, CDL has also included a Board Statement in this 

dedicated Sustainability Report, as well as in the “Sustainability” section in 

CDL’s 2015 Annual Report.

Climate Change: 

Singapore’s Intended 

Nationally Determined 

Contribution (INDC)

In July 2015, Singapore submitted its INDC to the United Nations Framework 

Convention on Climate Change. Singapore’s INDC states that it intends 

to reduce its emissions intensity by 36% from 2005 levels by 2030, and 

stabilise its emissions with the aim of peaking around 2030. 

Since 2011, CDL has set targets to reduce our carbon emissions intensity by 

22% by 2020 and 25% by 2030 from business-as-usual levels in baseline 

year 2007. In 2015, we further introduced electricity and water intensity 

targets in 2015 – to achieve a reduction of 22% by 2020 and 25% by 2030 

from baseline year 2007 across CDL’s core business.

Workplace Safety and 

Health (Design for Safety) 

Regulations

Under the Design for Safety (DfS) regulations, all parties involved in 

construction projects worth $10 million or more will have to comply with new 

safety rules from August 2016. A key requirement in the DfS regulations is 

the preparation of a DfS register. 

Since 2003, CDL has in place a two-part EHS risk register at all our 

property developments. This register comprises the Design EHS risk register 

maintained by our architects, engineers and designers, and a Construction 

EHS risk register maintained by our builders. 

In 2012, way before the DfS regulations were enacted, an additional Concept 

Design EHS Risk Register had already been incorporated at the planning 

stage of our developments.

Corporate Political Contributions

As outlined in our Anti-Corruption Policy, CDL has 

a corporate stance against using the Company’s 

resources to make donations to political parties 

and political associations, or to candidates and/or 

election agents in a parliamentary or presidential 

election. Employees who intend to be involved in any 

political party are required to declare and seek Top 

Management’s approval. 

Trade and Industry Associations

To further the sustainability cause at home and 

abroad, CDL’s Senior Management has been 

represented on various industry bodies and 

civil society organisations. Moving forward, 

CDL will continue to partner the industry and 

form collaborations in support of the Singapore 

Government’s agenda of becoming a smart and 

sustainable city.

The Community

Over the years, we have gone beyond shaping 

cityscapes to contributing towards community 

building. This has generated very strong social 

capital and goodwill for CDL in the communities 

we operate in. By actively initiating and supporting 

sustained outreach programmes in four focus areas 

– environmental conservation, youth development, 

the arts, and caring for the less fortunate – CDL 

aims to deliver a lasting and positive impact in the 

communities we operate in. 

Managing Community Impact

CDL understands that building activities at 

construction sites might pose inconveniences 

to the local community which we define as 

residents who live in the immediate vicinity of 

a construction site. Aside from complying with 

applicable legal requirements, we require builders 

at our development sites to communicate with the 

community and offer avenues where the residents 

can give comments and feedback.

At all construction sites, hotline numbers and 

contact details are displayed on hoardings and 

signboards as an avenue for public feedback. 

Feedback collected are compiled and analysed and 

concerns are addressed. 

Since 2014, CDL has in place a public 

communications plan for the community within 

a 100 m radius of our development plans for the 

land parcel. As part of efforts to keep the local 

community informed, plans are in place to send 

out flyers with project details and the construction 

schedule. Measures to reduce the impact of 

construction work on the surroundings also continue 

to be a priority. 

73


SPOTLIGHT

Caring for Public Health and Safety

Health and safety are at the core of all that we do. 

This includes ensuring the health and safety of 

our homebuyers, tenants, shoppers and even the 

community in the vicinity of our buildings. 

CDL places great emphasis on the structural stability 

of our buildings, fire safety compliance, and the 

integrity of building materials. Qualified professionals 

like resident engineers and technical supervisory staff 

are engaged to monitor construction to ensure they 

are built in accordance with building regulations and 

codes. Our builders are expected to meet our high 

standards in terms of the quality and sustainability of 

our buildings.

Community Spring Cleaning

With the warmer conditions brought about by the El Niño weather phenomenon, mosquito breeding 

is a key public health concern in Singapore due to the faster breeding and maturation cycles of the 

Aedes mosquito. 

As a responsible corporate citizen, CDL is committed to creating a positive impact on the community. 

While our construction activities are undertaken by our builders, we influence and strongly encourage 

them to embark on their own CSR and EHS initiatives. In addition to regular vector control programmes 

at the construction site, many of our builders have also gone the extra mile to help clean up the 

surrounding public areas. Through these efforts, our builders hope to build greater trust and better 

rapport with residents in the neighbouring community.

Helping the Less Fortunate through 

Employee Volunteerism

Apart from monetary donations to deserving charities, 

CDL has always believed in engaging our stakeholders 

through active employee volunteerism to complement 

our philanthropic giving and deliver greater impact. 

Since 1999, CDL’s dedicated employee volunteer 

arm, CSC, has been reaching out to help the less 

fortunate and underprivileged. In 2015, we achieved 

an employee participation rate of 74% and a total of 

2,079 volunteer manhours.

Raising Eco-awareness in the Wider Community

Key Initiatives

Impact

EcoBank – a CDL 

and Eco-Business 

Initiative

In December 2015, CDL partnered Eco-Business to launch a new initiative – EcoBank 

– to raise awareness of waste reduction and sustainable consumption. Through this 

initiative, nearly $48,000 was raised for disadvantaged women and children after a 

dollar-for-dollar match from the Care and Share movement under Community Chest. 

With the support of tenants and customers at City Square Mall and six of CDL’s 

commercial properties, over 6,000kg of pre-loved items were collected. CDL employees 

and partners also contributed over 500 volunteer hours to help realise this meaningful 

initiative.

National 

University of 

Singapore (NUS) 

Asia Environment

Lecture

In partnership with BCA, CDL supported the 3rd Asia Environment Lecture which was 

co-organised by various faculties in the NUS. More than 200 students, academia, and 

industry representatives benefited from the insights shared by renowned speaker Ms 

Christine Ervin — the first CEO and President of the US Green Building Council — on 

the drivers underpinning the rapid uptake of green building and the future of resilient 

infrastructure.

Reduce @ North

West Power Up

Scheme”

CDL partnered the North West Community Development Council (CDC) on a scheme 

to help needy families defray their electricity bills while raising environmental 

awareness amongst the community. CDL has pledged to donate $10 to the scheme for 

every household that pledges to sign up for a six-month energy audit, up to a cap of 

$100,000. The scheme is expected to assist up to 600 households over three years.

NEA Environment 

Challenge for 

Schools (ECS)

The NEA ECS is a national-level competition that encourages schools to partner 

tri-sector (business, government, and non-profit) organisations in the co-creation of 

solutions to solve local environmental challenges.

CDL’s partner schools — Beatty Secondary School, Raffles Girls’ School (Secondary), and 

CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School (Secondary) — won 2nd place and Merit prize respectively 

for the NEA ECS. The first two schools showcased their winning projects at the Clean 

and Green SG50 Carnival. The Carnival, which was co-organised by the Ministry of the 

Environment and Water Resources, NEA, North East CDC, National Parks Board, and 

Public Utilities Board, also featured a CDL-branded Eco Home exhibit which offered 

environmentally-friendly tips that Singaporeans can practise at home.

HUMAN CAPITAL

INVEST

IN OUR PEOPLE


HUMAN CAPITAL

Our employees are the driving force behind our 

sustained growth. We believe strongly in the 

importance of employee engagement, talent 

acquisition, and retention, to remain an employer 

of choice. Our HR policies and initiatives are 

geared towards building a conducive workplace for 

our employees’ development and well-being. This 

increases productivity and employee satisfaction, 

which enable us to achieve organisational and 

business excellence. 

In addition, we also recognise that the workers at our 

construction sites are key resources to the long-term 

viability of our business. While they may not operate 

directly within our immediate realm of influence, this 

has not prevented us from being a strong advocate of 

health and safety across our value chain. 

HEALTH AND SAFETY

People are our greatest asset and their safety 

and well-being are of utmost importance. It is 

our responsibility to provide a safe and healthy 

environment for our employees, customers as well as 

the workers at our construction sites. 

In addition to workplace health and safety, we also 

place great emphasis on employee health and well-

being. Ergonomics, stress, and anxiety can have 

significant impact on job performance, employee 

satisfaction, and retention, which ultimately affect 

organisational goals and objectives.

In line with our corporate EHS Policy, KPIs were 

identified with targets established and reviewed 

annually to monitor our EHS performance. This is 

to ensure that we achieve a consistently high EHS 

standard across the organisation. More details on our 

EHS Policy can be found on page 32.

As early as 2003, we received the Occupational 

Health and Safety Management System (OHSAS) 

18001 certification for our development projects. 

Since 2011, all properties under management in 

Singapore were also certified. 

Safety at Construction Sites 

All our builders are required to have an accredited 

safety and health management system in place. 

This is a pre-requisite in the tender review process. 

We actively engage our consultants and builders in 

health and safety matters through risk reviews and 

monitoring of EHS performance. 

We recognise that labour shortage will continue to 

pose a challenge as we uphold workplace safety and 

health standards through our management system. 

Through a combination of rewards and penalties, 

we hope to heighten awareness and minimise safety 

breaches at all our construction sites. 

As a result of various safety initiatives and engagement 

with our builders and their workers, CDL’s Accident 

Frequency Rate (AFR)1 and Workplace Injury Rate (WIR)2 

remained way below the construction industry average. 

 

AFR at Construction Sites:

 

No. of workplace accidents per million 

 

manhours worked

 

WIR at Construction Sites:

 

No. of fatal and non-fatal workplace injuries per  

 

100,000 persons employed

HUMAN CAPITAL

There were a total of five reportable work-related 

accidents in 2015 at our construction sites. Our 

builders also received one stop work order and one 

fine for workplace safety and health related non-

compliances. Even though the accidents and non-

compliances were a result of lapses in our builders’ 

site practices, CDL is fully committed to working 

with them to continuously improve safety and health 

conditions at the construction sites.

Workplace Safety and Health

At the CDL Corporate Office, there were no fatalities 

and reportable accidents in 2015, resulting in zero 

WIR and AFR. There were also no occupational 

diseases reported. The average medical leave taken 

per employee per year was approximately four days, 

and these were not arising from any workplace 

incidents.

8% of the employees at our Corporate Office 

are involved in workplace health and safety 

committees. Initiatives and activities planned by 

these committees are part of a continual process to 

protect and promote health, safety, and well-being 

of all employees, as well as the sustainability of our 

workplace.

Healthy Living 

An array of activities were organised in 2015 to 

promote a healthy lifestyle amongst our employees:

• Free annual basic health screenings for all 

employees during work hours

• Discounted health screening programmes for the 

family members of our employees

• Bi-monthly healthy snacks to promote better 

consumption habits

• Regular lunchtime talks on joint pain management, 

cancer fighting diet, hypertension prevention, and 

personal grooming

Active Lifestyle

To encourage employees to get active and stay 

healthy, CDL organises various fitness activities 

including yoga, pilates, stair-climbing, dragon 

boating, bowling, table tennis, and futsal.

Emotional Well-being

CDL’s Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) 

provides support for issues concerning work, family 

matters, and interpersonal relationships. Employees 

can be assured of confidentiality when they call the 

EAP hotline manned by a third-party psychologist.

HUMAN RIGHTS

Since 2005, CDL has been a signatory to the UN 

Global Compact and is committed to its principles 

on Human Rights and Labour, which are derived 

from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 

the International Labour Organisation’s Declaration 

on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Our 

stand on human and labour rights are also outlined 

in our Corporate Statement on Human Rights found 

on page 32, which is published on CDL’s website 

and communicated to our builders and contractors 

for adherence.

Additionally, CDL fully complies with the following 

legislations on the welfare and rights of our 

employees. In 2015, there were no incidents and 

grievances of discrimination, child labour or forced 

labour at the CDL Corporate Office.

The Employment Act

The Employment Act outlines the statutory 

requirements of hiring employees in Singapore. 

Employees are eligible for overtime compensation 

in accordance with the Employment Act. Beyond 

compliance, our employee benefits typically exceed 

the requirements stipulated within the Act. Benefits 

are extended to managerial and executive level 

employees who are not covered under the Act. More 

information on our benefits can be found on the 

next page. 

Anti-Child and Anti-Forced Labour

In Singapore, legislations such as the Employment 

Act, Retirement Act, Workplace Safety and 

Health Act, and Factories Act mitigate risks and 

incidents of child and forced labour. For example, 

the Employment Act prohibits the employment of 

80


children below 13 years of age and stipulates a clear 

set of laws for the employment of children between 

13 and 15 years old, including their working hours 

and the type of work they can be engaged in. The 

Commissioner for Labour must be notified if they are 

engaged in industrial undertakings or have obtained 

permission to work on their rest days.

In addition to the existing legislations, CDL ensures 

that all employees are issued employment contracts 

specifying clear employment terms and conditions. 

We also require our suppliers to adhere strictly to 

such legislations.

Respect for Freedom of Association

CDL respects all employees’ fundamental rights 

to freedom of association and the right to be 

members of trade unions. Although CDL is not a 

unionised company, we are guided by the Industrial 

Relations Act which allows trade unions to represent 

our employees for collective bargaining, providing 

our employees with an avenue to seek redress for 

disputes. 

On the other hand, our key subsidiaries CBM Pte Ltd 

and The Tower Club are both unionised, providing 

their workforce a channel for collective bargaining.

BENEFITS AND WELFARE

Beyond competitive remuneration, we take care 

of our employees through comprehensive welfare 

and benefits schemes, including but not limited to 

insurance coverage, medical, and dental benefits for 

our full-time employees. Part-time employees also 

enjoy similar benefits on either a full or pro-rated 

basis, thereby promoting a conducive environment 

should employees decide to take on part-time 

arrangements to cope with their personal needs. 

Pro-Family Benefits

CDL adopts benefits and welfare practices in 

line with the Singapore Government’s pro-family 

legislation. Mothers whose children are Singapore 

Citizens at birth get to enjoy maternity leave of 16 

weeks as advocated by the Government. CDL also 

provides eligible employees with childcare leave, 

extended childcare leave, paternity leave and shared 

parental leave.

In recognition of the important role fathers play 

in the family, CDL participated in the enhanced 

paternity leave scheme introduced by the Singapore 

Government in 2015. The scheme allows male 

employees who have citizen child(ren) born from 

2015 to enjoy two weeks of paternity leave in 

comparison to the legislated one week of paternity 

leave. They are also entitled to share one week of 

the 16 weeks of maternity leave, subject to the 

agreement of the mother, if the mother qualifies for 

the Government-Paid Maternity Leave. 

In 2015, 12 eligible female CDL employees utilised 

their maternity benefits and all 12 employees are still 

employed with the Company after their return from 

maternity leave. Five eligible male employees used 

their paternity leave benefits.

98 CDL employees (28 male, 70 female) with at 

least one Singapore Citizen child under the age of 

seven were entitled to six days of paid childcare leave 

in 2015. In addition, 35 employees (four male, 31 

female) with at least one Singapore Citizen child 

aged seven to 12 years were entitled to two days of 

paid extended childcare leave in 2015. All eligible 

employees have utilised these entitlements.

Flexible Work Arrangements

CDL also provides flexible work arrangements for 

employees with special family needs to manage their 

personal and work commitments more effectively. 

Full-time employees can convert to working part-

time, and enjoy similar benefits as full-time 

employees on a full or pro-rated basis. In 2015, 

three employees worked on a part-time arrangement.

Fair Remuneration

CDL’s compensation packages are aligned with 

internal parity and market benchmarks. CDL offers 

fair and competitive remuneration packages based on 

employees’ performance, roles and responsibilities. 

This is to ensure that we remain competitive in 

attracting talent which is key to our sustained 

growth. CDL also has a well-structured and open 

annual performance appraisal system which is 

reviewed periodically and enhanced to ensure 

open communication between employees and their 

reporting officers.

81


Performance-Based Appraisal

As a company committed to meritocracy, our 

rewards and compensation policies emphasise on 

employees’ performance. This is judged not only on 

what employees achieve in the review period, but 

also on how it is achieved. All employees received 

performance and career development reviews in 

2015. Our performance management process was 

reviewed periodically to incorporate employees’ 

feedback and enhancements to the system. 

In 2015, our performance management process 

was enhanced to incorporate an assessment matrix 

to derive and calculate employees’ achievements 

in relation to goals set. The revised set of CDL core 

values has also been included in the assessment of 

how well an employee has displayed the core values 

in his or her daily work.

Competitive Remuneration

Remuneration is recommended by the HR 

Department and the Group General Manager’s Office, 

and approved by the Remuneration Committee 

which consists of members from the CDL Board of 

Directors. Salary benchmarks against market surveys 

are conducted to ensure relevancy of CDL’s salaries 

with the industry and the overall market. An external 

consultancy firm was engaged to conduct a biennial 

Employee Engagement Survey to gather employees’ 

opinions and feedback, including their perception of 

CDL’s remuneration and reward system. 

In the recent Employee Engagement Survey 

conducted in 2015, more than 60% of our 

employees have rated CDL’s remuneration and 

benefits favourably, six percentage points higher than 

the Singapore National Norms3.

ESG-Linked Remuneration

CDL recognises that inclusion of appropriate 

ESG issues within executive management goals 

and incentive schemes is an important factor in 

promoting greater recognition of and accountability 

in our CSR practices. In 2015, CDL reviewed 

the performance appraisal system to establish 

stronger linkages between employee and executive 

remuneration and our corporate sustainability 

performance. ESG indicators that are aligned with 

global standards such as ISO 26000, ISO 140001 

and GRI reporting indicators, to name a few, have 

been incorporated in the individual goals setting of 

all employees, including senior management.

Central Provident Fund (CPF) Scheme 

and Contributions

The CPF is a comprehensive social security savings 

plan which aims to provide working Singaporeans 

and Permanent Residents with a measure of financial 

security and confidence in their old age. CPF 

contribution is computed based on a percentage of 

the employee’s monthly salary and varies with the 

employee’s age.

Savings in the Ordinary Account earn a minimum 

risk-free interest of 2.5% guaranteed by Government, 

while savings in Special, Medisave, and Retirement 

Accounts will earn 4% per annum. CPF funds can be 

used for the following purposes:

• Retirement Plan 

To ensure sufficient savings to see CPF members 

through their retirement

• Healthcare Plan 

To ensure sufficient savings to meet members’ 

medical needs in their old age

• Home Ownership Plan 

To ensure a property that is fully paid-up when 

members retire

• Family Protection 

Several schemes and insurance plans such as the 

Dependents’ Protection Scheme, Home Protection 

Scheme, catastrophic medical insurance scheme 

and even severe disability insurance scheme to 

protect CPF members and their families

• Asset Enhancement 

CPF members have the choice to decide for 

themselves how to invest their CPF savings and what 

risks to accept, to ensure their financial security

CDL assists employees to make monthly contributions 

which are deducted from their monthly gross salaries 

and deposits the contribution into their CPF accounts, 

as required by law. In addition to employees’ 

contribution of 20%, CDL contributes an additional 

17% as an employer, making a total monthly 

contribution of 37% to the employee’s CPF account.

LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT

CDL strongly believes that investing in learning and 

development will give CDL the competitive edge for 

future growth and success. All new employees are 

required to attend the CDL On-Boarding Programme, 

which aims to induct and integrate new hires into the 

organisational culture seamlessly. Annual training 

needs analysis is conducted to ensure that there 

are necessary training interventions to level up 

competencies and professional knowledge. 

Training Hours and Investments

In 2015, CDL invested over $370,000 and clocked 

over 16,000 hours in training and development. 100% 

of our workforce was provided the opportunity to attend 

training, while over 50% of the workforce achieved an 

average of four training days or more per employee.

Education Sponsorships and Scholarships

CDL also sponsors part-time courses relevant 

to employees’ work, conducted locally by 

recognised institutions and universities. In 2015, 

CDL sponsored two employees to upgrade their 

educational qualifications. 

We believe in nurturing and investing in talents 

even before they join the organisation. Since 2001, 

CDL has been partnering BCA to offer the BCA-CDL 

Built Environment Undergraduate Scholarship for 

young adults who excel academically and are keen 

to pursue a career with CDL after graduation. So 

far, CDL has offered 10 scholarships to local young 

talents, up from eight reported in 2014. There are 

currently five scholars in our workforce and three 

scholars who will join CDL upon their graduation.

Internships 

In addition, CDL partners with local tertiary 

education institutions to offer student internship 

opportunities for students interested in the property 

industry. In 2015, there were 10 interns assigned to 

various departments in CDL.

Talent Management

Developing a robust talent pool is crucial to 

strengthening CDL’s position as a leading property 

developer. The CDL Leadership Programme is 

structured to develop high-potential employees by 

sharpening their leadership and general management 

skills to enable them to become more effective leaders.

Building Capacity in CSR and EHS

We educate employees on our CSR efforts and inspire 

action at every level of our business. This begins with 

the induction of new employees and the provision of 

learning opportunities on CSR and EHS issues.

To cultivate a “Safe and Green” corporate culture, 

EHS training and awareness programmes are planned 

for all CDL employees. Employees are also encouraged 

to attend relevant external conferences and workshops 

to strengthen their CSR knowledge and EHS 

management skills. Over 3,900 training hours were 

dedicated to CSR and EHS issues in 2015, which 

include ISO 26000 core subjects such as human 

rights, anti-corruption, and environmental protection.

83


In 2015, an esteemed panel comprising renowned 

CSR expert Mr Wayne Visser and SGX’s Special 

Adviser Ms Yeo Lian Sim, shared their views on global 

sustainability trends and the move towards mandatory 

sustainability reporting at an in-house seminar. The 

seminar was well-attended by close to 80 participants, 

including the Board of Directors of Hong Leong 

Group’s listed companies, as well as the Senior 

Management and CSR committee members of CDL.

From the 2015 Employee Engagement Survey, 94% 

of our employees have rated CDL’s CSR commitment 

and practices favourably, 12 percentage points higher 

than the Singapore National Norms3.

JOB CREATION AND SECURITY

CDL adheres to the Tripartite Guidelines on Managing 

Excess Manpower issued by the Ministry of Manpower 

(MOM) and its tripartite partners, Singapore National 

Employers Federation and the National Trades Union 

Congress. The Company supports and shares a similar 

philosophy as the Tripartite Guidelines, which strongly 

encourage companies to manage excess manpower and 

consider reorganisation as a last resort. The Guidelines 

also suggest providing retraining programmes for 

workers, redeploying of workers to alternative work areas, 

implementing shorter work weeks, temporary layoffs, 

flexible work arrangements, and managing wage costs 

through a flexible wage system. 

In the past five years, there has been no major 

reorganisation within CDL that resulted in job cuts  

or redundancies. 

In the event of termination or employee resignation, a 

minimum notice period of one to three months needs 

to be fulfilled, depending on the employee’s job 

grade. Due to operational requirements, middle and 

senior management are required to provide a notice 

period of two and three months respectively.

Total No. of Employees

As at 31 December 2015, CDL has a total of 429 

employees. 93% of our HODs are Singaporeans 

or Permanent Residents, hired from our local 

community. 6.29% of our employees are hired on 

permanent contract basis.

New Hires

As our business grows, so does our capacity to provide 

secure employment. Despite cyclical downswings in 

the property market, we have managed to sustain 

our growth without cutting headcount. In 2015, we 

witnessed a year-on-year growth of 2% in employee 

strength as our operations expanded.

Out of the 74 new hires in 2015, 58 were 

replacements for existing positions and 16 were

Employer of Choice

As a testament to our steadfast commitment to be 

an employer of choice, CDL was awarded the W.O.W! 

Special Mention Award by Great Place To Work® for 

our progressive workplace culture and good people 

practices in 2015. 

Based on the 2015 Employee Engagement Survey, 

CDL achieved a Sustainable Engagement Score 

of 80%, eight percentage points higher than the 

Singapore National Norm3. The biennial survey 

provides insights into potential employee concerns 

and allows CDL to proactively address them, hence 

improving employee engagement and effectiveness. 

Retirement and Re-Employment Practices

The Singapore Government implemented  

re-employment legislation in 2012 to enable more 

people to continue working to 65 years of age, 

beyond the current statutory retirement age of 62. 

This will be increased to 67 in future. The legislation 

requires employers to offer re-employment to 

employees with satisfactory performance and who are 

medically fit.

Since 2005, CDL has extended re-employment 

to employees who have reached retirement age. 

Employees who are due for retirement but still able 

to contribute to CDL can remain employed at full pay. 

At age 62, employees who meet CDL’s re-employment 

criteria (i.e. satisfactory performance and medically 

fit, with availability of a suitable role), will be re-

employed in the same job. They will be offered an 

annual contract with no change in existing benefits 

and salary, and are also eligible for all bonuses.

As stipulated by legislation, CDL also provides a one-

off Employment Assistance Payment for employees 

who reach age 62 but do not meet the criteria for 

re-employment.

In 2015, CDL had nine employees above the age of 

62. Two employees at age 62 were re-employed in 

the same job, while one employee was eligible for the 

Employment Assistance Payment.

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL 

OPPORTUNITY

We believe that having an inclusive culture 

is important for our business. CDL provides 

equal opportunities for all employees without 

discrimination. Our recruitment process adheres 

to the strict guidelines on non-discrimination and 

fairness. There is no preference for any particular 

gender, ethnicity, religion, or age.

 

Age Profile

We have a diversified workforce across all age 

groups. In 2015, 81% of new recruits were 

Generation Ys (Gen Ys) (born in 1978 or later). 

More than 40% of our current workforce now 

consists of Gen Ys, injecting new ideas, enthusiasm, 

and energy to our organisation. In 2015, 37% of 

promotions went to Gen Y employees.

Gender Diversity 

CDL has more females than males in both managerial 

and non-managerial categories – a testament to the 

Company’s emphasis on gender diversity and the 

success of our pro-family initiatives. 

In 2015, females in both non-managerial and 

managerial positions were paid 96% of the average 

pay of males, with female employees holding more 

of the junior positions within the Company.

Racial and Disability Inclusion 

CDL embraces an inclusive workplace in our 

multi-racial workforce from diverse educational 

backgrounds. Our workforce is nonetheless heavier 

on the number of Chinese employees as a reflection 

of Singapore’s predominantly Chinese population. 

Where possible, we also provide fair employment 

opportunities for the less physically-abled. As of 

2015, CDL has a wheelchair-bound employee who 

has been with the Company for five years.

MOVING FORWARD

From 2016, CDL has implemented the SAP SuccessFactors Learning Management System (LMS) to better 

identify and assess individual and organisational learning needs. The LMS also improves course administration, 

skills gap analysis, tracking and reporting. Through this new system, training metrics can be recorded and trends 

can be analysed, to ensure cost effectiveness and efficiency in our training budgeting and expenditure.

INDEPENDENT LIMITED ASSURANCE STATEMENT 

Independent Limited Assurance 

Statement to the Management of 

City Developments Limited (‘CDL’)

We have performed limited assurance procedures in 

relation to CDL’s Sustainability Report 2016 (‘the 

Report’) as detailed in the ‘Subject Matter’ below. 

The management’s responsibility 

CDL’s Sustainability Report 2016 has been prepared 

by the Management of CDL, which is responsible 

for the collection and presentation of the information 

it contains and for maintaining adequate records 

and internal controls that are designed to support 

the sustainability reporting process. There are 

currently no legally prescribed requirements relating 

to the preparation, publication and verification of 

sustainability reports.

The auditor’s responsibility 

Our responsibility in performing our limited assurance 

activities is to the Management of CDL only and in 

accordance with the terms of reference agreed with 

them. We do not accept or assume any responsibility 

for any other purpose or to any other person or 

organisation. Any reliance any such third party may 

place on the Report is entirely at their own risk.

Our review was limited to the information on the 

select indicators set out within the Report from 

01 January 2015 to 31 December 2015 and our 

responsibility does not include:

• Any work in respect of sustainability information 

published elsewhere on CDL’s annual report, 

website and other publications,

• Sustainability information prior to 01 January 

2015 and subsequent to 31 December 2015, and

• Management’s forward looking statements such as 

targets, plans and intentions.

Our multi-disciplinary team has the required 

competencies and experience to conduct this assurance 

engagement. Our professionals have experience in both 

assurance skills and in the applicable subject matter 

including environmental, social and financial aspects.

Reporting criteria

As a basis for the assurance engagement, we have 

used relevant criteria in the sustainability reporting 

guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI 

G4) and the Construction &amp; Real Estate Sector 

Supplement. We consider these reporting criteria to 

be relevant and appropriate to review the Report.

Assurance standard used and level of assurance

Our limited assurance engagement has been planned 

and performed in accordance with the ISAE 30001 

Assurance Engagement Other Than Audits or Reviews 

of Historical Financial Information. We have also 

considered the Global Reporting Initiative G4 (‘GRI 

G4’) reporting guidelines in conducting our limited 

assurance procedures.

A limited assurance engagement consists of making 

enquiries and applying analytical and other limited 

assurance procedures. Our procedures were designed 

to provide a limited level of assurance and as such do 

not provide all the evidence that would be required to 

provide a reasonable level of assurance. 

The procedures performed depend on the assurance 

practitioner’s judgement including the risk of material 

misstatement of the specific activity data, whether due 

to fraud or error. While we considered the effectiveness 

of Management’s internal controls when determining the 

nature and extent of our procedures, our review was not 

designed to provide assurance on internal controls. We 

believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient 

and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.

Scope of work

We have been engaged by the Management of CDL to 

perform limited assurance on selected indicators of 

the Report as set out in Subject Matter below.

processes for data aggregation and reporting, with 

relevant personnel to understand the quality of 

checks and control mechanisms, assessing and 

testing the controls in relation to the concerned 

subject matters in the Report

4. Interviews with employees and management (CSR 

committee, human resources, property &amp; facilities 

management, marketing, environment health &amp; 

safety, customer service, internal audit, enterprise 

risk management, projects, corporate secretarial 

services) to understand key sustainability issues 

related to the select indicators and processes 

for the collection and accurate reporting of 

performance information

5. Obtain documentation through sampling 

methods to verify assumptions, estimations and 

computations made by management in relation to 

the concerned subject matters in the Report

6. Checking that data and statements had been 

correctly transcribed from corporate systems and / 

or supporting evidence, into the Report

7. Obtain various certifications, audit reports and 

financial statement report in relation to the 

concerned subject matters in the Report

Our independence

EY has provided independent assurance services in 

relation to CDL’s Sustainability Report 2016. 

In conducting our assurance engagement we have 

met the independence requirements of the Institute 

of Singapore Chartered Accountants and Code of 

Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants 

and Accounting Entities. Our EY independence policies 

prohibit any financial interests in our clients that 

would or might be seen to impair independence. Each 

year, partners and staff are required to confirm their 

compliance with the firm’s policies. 

Observations and areas for improvement

Our observations and areas for improvement will be 

raised in an internal report to CDL’s Management. 

These observations do not affect our conclusions on 

the Report set out below. 

Conclusion
