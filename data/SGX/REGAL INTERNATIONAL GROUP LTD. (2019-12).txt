Overview of Report 

Regal International Group Ltd. (“RIG” or the “Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, the 

“Group”) proudly presents our third annual sustainability report. All data, statistics and 

information presented in this report are in relation to the sustainability performance in the 

financial year ended 31 December 2019 (“FY2019”). No restatements were made from the 

previous report as there were no significant changes to the organization and our supply chain 

during the reporting cycle. Our approach to sustainability is guided by the Group’s mission to 

create sustainable values for our stakeholders.  

 

In selecting the content for inclusion in our 2019 Sustainability Report (the “SR”), we have used 

the Global Reporting Initiative Standards (“GRI Standards”) reporting principles of materiality, 

sustainability context, stakeholder inclusiveness, and completeness. As we continue our 

journey as a formidable builder developer, we regularly review our strategy and approach to 

corporate social responsibility. This ongoing analysis helps us to identify and prioritize the issues 

of relevance to our business and our stakeholders. 

 

Scope of Report 

RIG started producing its Sustainability Report annually utilizing the GRI for the first time in June 

2018. The last SR report was published in July 2019 for the reporting period covering from 1 

January 2018 to 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”). This report covers our performance in FY2019, 

from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. 

 

This report aims to provide a balanced and reasonable representation of the sustainability 

performance of RIG. All the information and statistics are in relations to the Group’s operations 

unless stated otherwise. All information and data are not verified by third party. Internal data 

monitoring and verification have been relied on to ensure accuracy. 

 

Reporting Process 

For FY2019, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) and RIG’s management would continue to 

rely on internal efforts to present the respective statistics of the key material aspects of 

sustainability. 

 

RIG’s Sustainability Reporting Committee (the “SR Committee”) consists of the Chief Executive 

Officer (the “CEO”), the SR Champion, and the key management staff of each core business 

function. 

 

The SR Committee manages and integrates all sustainability practices for the Group, using the 

SGX sustainability guidelines to assist in their course of action for the preparation of SR. After 

key management staff from the various departments collated data statistics and information 

necessary, the SR Champion will compile and coordinate the SR report for further review and 

comments by the SR Committee and the Board.

Message from the Board 

 

Despite challenging market conditions, the Group followed through on its efforts to conserve 

business sustainability in FY2019. 

 

Sustainable Journey 

 

FY2019 was yet another challenging year for RIG. The ongoing challenging economic situation 

for Malaysia has only shown that there is still much work to be done in the rebuilding and the 

re-strengthening of the country and these ongoing changes have reflected themselves in the 

business performance of the Group. 

 

However, as compared to FY2018, FY2019 performance has improved slightly and we are 

taking this as a positive sign of returning market confidence as well as progress, albeit a slow 

one, in terms of improving market conditions for the property sector. 

 

Achievements 

 

Starting as a small building construction and property development company since 2004, the 

Group has continued to achieve an impressive track record of constructing and developing 

more than 30 property development projects in Kuching and Kota Samarahan area, including 

shop houses, landed residential properties, condominiums, commercial and industrial units. 

 

The Group was elated to have been one of the recipients of the award of Prominent 

Developers in Sarawak by Sarawak Housing and Real Estate Developers’ Association 

(“SHEDA”) on 18 January 2019 as recognition of our efforts to continuously deliver quality 

projects in Sarawak. 

 

Forward Strategy 

 

Looking forward, while 2020 and the years ahead may result in much changes and unforeseen 

economic challenges with the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group will continue 

to do its best endeavours to overcome such issues despite the unprecedented scale of the 

ongoing health crisis affecting industries and the economy. 

 

RIG will continue to focus on completing and delivering our mega projects, as well as to 

increase our sales momentum to improve financial performance. In the year to come, the 

Group is looking to cater to market demands for the types of properties that are needed by 

the mass market, and will shift our attention to capitalising on the current demand trends.

Strategic Updates 

 

Fundamental Beliefs  

 

Giving and sharing have always been an integral part of RIG’s corporate culture since day 

one. Started more than 15 years ago, the Group has been playing an active role in charitable 

community works with the aim of creating a more harmonious society. 

 

Staff and management of RIG have been passionately participating in fundraisers for welfare 

organizations, schools, associations for the underprivileged, orphanage and old folk homes in 

Kuching, Sarawak on a regular basis. Our vision of “Forging Sustainable Future” denotes our 

business value when developing properties, as we aspire to polish a future where all needs 

and wants of all stakeholders could be accommodated. 

 

Commitment  

 

The Group believes in giving back to the society and contributing to the general social well-

being through the execution of development projects and the management of its operations. 

 

In February 2019, RIG spread the joy of Chinese New Year by handing out Angpows to various 

welfare organisations in Kuching, Sarawak such as Home of Peace and Sarawak Cheshire 

Home. These tokens of blessings put smile and warmth in these less fortunate, who are mostly 

ailing elderly and physically disabled in old folk homes and handicapped homes. 

 

Subsequently, our RIG staff and management also involved in setting up booths at the charity 

food fairs organised by Persatuan Bagi Kebajikan Kanak-Kanak Terencat Akal Sarawak 

(“PERKATA”) to help raise funds for the respective welfare organisations. The initial budget to 

procure food items for sale was provided by the Group and our staff volunteered to man the 

booth. All sale proceeds were donated to the aforementioned charities. 

 

During the year, the Group also established connections with several associate partners, such 

as Express LUCK (Shenzhen) Pte Ltd, MERK-EL Elderly Care and Dr. Xu Kecheng Cancer 

Rehabilitation Center, as well as local college for higher education Institute Technology 

Maklumat Nusantara College, for varied collaborations. 

 

Future Aspirations 

 

RIG will continue to seek growth through strategic acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances in 

addition to existing project portfolio. 

 

The Group will continue to focus on completing and delivering our mega projects, as well as 

not losing sight of sustainability in FY2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite disruptions, 

we begun to explore more flexible ways of working for colleagues such as working from home 

and changing shifts. In the year to come, the Group is also looking to cater to market demands 

for the types of properties that are needed by the mass market, and will shift our attention to 

capitalising on the current demand trends.

As of 31 December 2019, RIG recorded 131 male and 77 female employees. The scenario was 

similar to the previous year where there was more male employees almost by one fold 

compared to the female employees in FY2019. The reason behind this scenario is that the

assigned to our various construction sites.

Parental Leaves 

 

RIG encourage employees to practice work-life balance in the knowledge that it is an 

important aspect of a healthy work environment. We provide paid parental leave for male 

and female employees to allow mothers and fathers to adapt to their life-changing moments. 

As a Group, it is important for us to support our employees in meeting both workplace and 

personal needs as it has been proven to help boost employee morale and productivity at 

work.  

 

For FY2019, only 1 female employee has taken maternity leave from August 2019 until October 

2019 and did not return to work after her leave ended. Hence, she is now no longer with the 

Group. 

 

 

Training &amp; Development 

 

The success of our growth depends on the quality of our workforce. Having the right people 

with the right skills is essential for our continued growth. We acknowledge that it is crucial for 

our employees to undergo training programmes to enhance knowledge and skills in order to 

better perform at work. As such, we continuously guide the developmental progress of our 

employees by providing relevant training, which subsequently benefits our business growth.  

 

Our training framework is designed for all employment levels, from non-executives to junior 

management, middle management and senior management. The training programmes 

offered mainly encompass Sales and Marketing, Technical, Health, Safety and Environment, 

Green and Sustainability, Health and Wellness, Language, Finance and Information 

Technology.

In ensuring that the career development of our employees is monitored and gaps are 

addressed, the Group conducts yearly performance appraisals for 100% of our people, 

including managerial and non-managerial staffs. The work performance of all employees from 

all employment levels are reviewed by their respective superiors and Divisional General 

Manager or General Manager. Any identified gaps in employees’ career development are 

addressed and training plans are created for our employees.

Workplace Health and Safety 

 

Providing employees with a safe and healthy environment has always been one of RIG’s top 

priorities. Safety practices had been constantly implemented not only at our head offices, but 

also at all our construction sites to minimize the safety risks. 

 

The Group also set forth several safety rules and guidelines to be strictly followed by all our 

employees at all times. 

 

Once again, the Group is proud to announce that we have achieved zero accident rate at 

all our workplaces and construction sites in Malaysia for FY2019.

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 

 

Charitable giving has been a part of RIG for decades, as we constantly believes in sharing is a 

kind of honest communication in expressing our caring to people who need help. The Group 

has constantly looked into various ways to support community and welfare related activities 

as we know every little bit of help counts. Showing more concern to the less fortunate people 

and having respect for their needs without any selfishness is rewarding in the way of increasing 

our happiness set point. 

 

 

Red Packets Giving @ Home of Peace and 

Sarawak Cheshire Home 





In the annual tradition of RIG during Chinese 

New Year, our staffs have charity visits to Home 

of Peace which is a charitable institution run by 

the Catholic Welfare Services Council Sarawak 

(CWS) under Roman Catholic Church, and 

given out red packets for the elderly to share 

the blessings and happiness with them. Through 

this campaign, we aim to achieve the objective 

of instilling values such as respecting and most 

importantly 

spending 

time 

with 

elders, 

especially during Chinese New Year when 

family reunion is a very significant tradition. In 

addition to that, our employees had brought 

cheers by providing support to Sarawak 

Cheshire Home in conjunction with the festive 

season celebration too.
