This report details our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) performance for FY2018 (1 July 

2017 to 30 June 2018) and covers the operations of NSG’s healthcare division in Singapore, and our 

energy division. We will consider including other overseas operations in the reporting scope of future

Sustainability Board Statement 

[GRI 102-14]  

 

Dear Stakeholders,  

As NSG embarks on its sustainability journey, we are delighted to share with you our inaugural 

Sustainability Report. Prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards 2016 (Core Option), this report 

outlines our efforts in embedding sustainable business practices across our healthcare and energy divisions.  

Our Sustainability Vision   

At NSG, sustainability is highly regarded by the Board and top management as key to maintaining our long-

term success, and we have collectively considered Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues in 

the formulation of our business strategy. We believe in the Group’s ability to leverage our core 

competencies in ways that both contributes to social inclusion and generates long-term economic 

opportunities, and are committed to creating an organisational culture which values sustainable business 

practices.  

Through a robust stakeholder engagement process, we have identified several ESG issues that are material 

to both our business and our stakeholders. They are namely: Economic Performance, Customer Health and 

Safety, Marketing and Labelling, and Customer Privacy. We also identified Market Presence as an emerging 

issue that could be given subsequent attention further to our expansion. Setting the tone from the top, we 

assume ultimate responsibility for reporting and overseeing the management and monitoring of these 

material issues. 

Our Sustainability Performance  

As a Group, NSG has directly generated a positive economic value of US$693 million over the reporting 

period, of which US$692 million is distributed as operating costs, and employee wages and benefits among 

other societal contributions. We have recorded zero incidents in topics considered material to our 

stakeholders and business operations, including breaches in marketing and labelling standards, or 

standards to maintain the health, safety and data privacy of our patients and customers. We intend to 

maintain our performance in FY2019, and in the customer health and safety category, to derive indicators 

to monitor our performance in a more specific manner. In the customer privacy arena, NSG will look to 

strengthen existing cyber security measures with additional IT enhancements to further safeguard our 

performance.  

Our Sustainability Commitment  

Going forward, NSG will continue to identify, manage and address our material ESG issues. We pledge to 

review them on an ongoing basis, taking into account the business environment, our business objectives 

and stakeholders’ feedback. The Group is in the process of finalising an organisational-wide Enterprise Risk 

Management (ERM) framework, which takes into account the ESG topics outlined in this report. The 

continuous integration of sustainability measures into our strategy and operations will be complemented 

by quality disclosures so as to provide our stakeholders with a holistic view of both our financial and non-

financial performance. We are on track in building a resilient and sustainable business committed to creating 

long-term value for all our stakeholders.

Sustainability at NSG 

[GRI 102-9 | 102-11 |102-12 | 102-13 | 102-16 | 102-18]

NSG is committed to conducting our business 

in a responsible manner as we embark on our 

sustainability journey. We acknowledge our 

role 

in 

minimising 

and 

mitigating 

environmental and social impacts from our 

business operations by adopting relevant risk 

management procedures across our divisions. 

The Group is in the process of finalising our 

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework 

for the ongoing identification, assessment and 

management of risk exposures to our business 

operations. The sustainability topics outlined in 

this report would be an integral part of the 

overall framework. 

 

 

Vision and Mission 

As NSG’s healthcare division, HSI envisages 

the organisation to be a leading integrated 

healthcare provider in Asia that places patients 

and community interests before self.  

To achieve this end, our mission is to positively 

impact lives and the community through 

excellent care. We value our patients and 

caregivers by treating those we serve, and 

each other, with compassion, dignity and 

respect. We achieve excellence by acting with 

integrity and striving for the highest quality 

care and service. 

At IEG, NSG’s energy division, sustainability is 

not only a strategy but a way of doing business 

where all employees and business partners 

embrace the highest standards in trading 

execution. We place a great emphasis on the 

most critical issues we face globally, even as 

we assess the impact of our business at the 

local level. We make sure environmental 

concerns are managed and the communities of 

where we work and the biodiversity around 

them are protected. 

Sustainability governance  

At NSG, we are committed to maintaining high 

standards of corporate governance across all 

functions of our organisation. We strive to put 

in place a robust governance framework to 

maintain 

integrity, 

accountability, 

and 

transparency in our operations. 

As the highest governing body of the Group, 

the Board is in charge of overseeing all ESG 

factors and sustainability-related matters of 

the organisation.  Please refer to page 13-24 

of our annual report for corporate governance 

report for our governance structure. NSG is 

also committed to achieving the highest 

standards in accordance with the principles 

and guidelines of the Code of Corporate 

Governance 2012 (the “Code”).  

 

Supply Chain 

At HSI, we procure drugs, dental and 

orthodontic appliances and consumables from 

pharmaceutical companies or authorised third-

party distributors.  Our clinics practice first-in-

first-out 

as 

our 

inventory 

management 

process, and we check expiry dates before 

dispensation or usage of products.  

 

 

At IEG, our supply chain elements are 

determined by Incoterms, a set of rules 

published by the International Chamber of 

Commerce defining the responsibilities of 

sellers and buyers for the delivery of goods 

under sales contracts.

As a business involved in the trading of oil 

products, 

our 

supply 

chain 

is 

typically 

positioned between the refineries and the end-

users. IEG only conducts business with 

terminals, facilities and ship-owners that 

follow adequate maintenance procedures, and 

specifically hire superintendents to oversee 

our operations as part of our emphasis on 

safety. As a responsible commodity industry 

player, we have established measures to 

prevent the harmful effects of our oil product 

shipments 

through 

the 

appointment 

of 

inspectors for every transaction, working with 

reputable suppliers and ship-owners, and 

ensuring relevant parties in the supply chains 

take precautions as per guidelines of their 

respective product material safety data sheets.  

Our team is committed to the establishment of 

efficient and safe models of supply of oil 

products, which, along with our innovations in 

the supply of products, makes us well-

positioned to meet both the needs of our 

customers today and in the future.

Stakeholder Engagement 

[GRI 102-40 | 102-42 | 102-43 | 102-44] 

 

NSG recognises the importance of meaningful two-way engagement with its stakeholders to understand 

their concerns and interests. We are committed to identifying issues most important to our stakeholders 

and addressing their concerns in the formulation of our business strategies and policies.  

We identified and selected our key stakeholders based on importance, representation, responsibility, 

dependency, and proximity to our business. The table below showcases our stakeholder engagement 

mechanisms. 

We continuously seek to improve stakeholder engagement by enhancing our communication channels 

and embedding their valuable feedback into our strategy.

Materiality Assessment 

[GRI 102-46 | 102-47 | 103-1] 

 

To identify material Environment, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) topics for NSG, the organisation 

considered a reasonable estimation of economic, environmental and/or social impacts and the interests 

and expectations of our stakeholders. It also conducted internal discussions with employees from 

departments that acted as proxies to the various stakeholder groups. While we identified eight topics as 

being relevant for the Group, five of the topics were prioritised for disclosure in this reporting period. 

These ESG topics were subsequently endorsed by NSG’s management and board.

Economic 

Economic Performance 

[GRI 103-1| 103-2 | 103-3 | 201-1] 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

The measurement of our economic and financial performance is a basic and fundamental indication of 

how we as an organisation has created wealth for our stakeholders, especially our investors and 

shareholders. We strive to continuously enhance our financial performance and create long-term value 

for our investors and stakeholders. 

Management approach 

While NSG’s overall financial performance in FY2018 is moderated by one-off expenses, including writing 

off of receivables and professional fees for corporate exercises, our core business divisions in healthcare 

and energy have contributed to positive economic value to our stakeholders for the reporting period.  

Following an organisational strategic review in FY2018, NSG decided to fine-tune our business strategy 

to focus on healthcare and energy as core businesses.  Besides the acquisition of new clinics in 

Singapore, FY2018 also saw the group setting its sights overseas for economic expansion.  We have 

entered talks with Vietnam-based Egroup Education Group Joint Stock Company for a new dental joint-

venture in Hanoi, and are also considering acquisition plans in China. The group is confident that our 

plans to strengthen our healthcare division will bear fruit in the coming years and contribute significantly 

to profitability going forward. 

FY2018 Performance  

The table below highlights the financial performance of two NSG’s major business divisions in 2018, HSI 

and IEG. More information on our financial performance as a Group is disclosed in our 2018 Annual 

Report.

Market Presence  

 

 

The Group has identified Market Presence, defined in the GRI Standards as covering an organisation’s 

contribution to economic development in the local areas or communities where it operates, as an 

emerging priority in its materiality analysis. With the Group poised for regional expansion through our 

plans for acquisitions in Vietnam and China, including local community members in the management 

team of our regional footprint would increase economic benefits to the local community and enhance 

local human capital. Such market presence could also improve our organisation’s ability to understand 

local needs and enhance our expansion strategy. Going forward, NSG will explore ways to strengthen 

its presence among local communities in Vietnam and China through the adoption of best practices in 

hiring and remuneration.

Social 

Customer Health and Safety 

[GRI 103-1 |103-2 | 103-3 | 416-1] 

 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

The safety and wellbeing of HSI’s patients is a top priority for NSG. As a provider of health and medical-

related products and services, our service and performance can have a direct impact on the health and 

safety of our patients, making this topic especially material to our organisation. We strive at NSG to not 

just meet the intended functions of our services and products to our patients, but to exceed their 

expectations and provide the highest standards of care and treatment. 

Our management approach  

HSI adhere strictly to government regulations such as the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act, 

Medicine Act and Health Products Act. Our clinics maintain strict adherence to these government 

regulations by observing a comprehensive set of standard operating procedures (“SOPs”) which follows 

clinical best practices, including clinic workflows and codes of conducts for clinical assistants. Our 

procedures are reviewed annually by the department heads, with required approvals by the Chief 

Executive Officer for new or changes to SOPs. We also ensure that our clinical staff are well-trained, 

and all new staff will receive orientation and on-the-job training by Clinic Heads. Monthly audits will be 

conducted to ensure compliance. Cases studies and industry incidences are shared with clinicians and 

frontline staff as occurred as reminders on patient safety and adherence to safe clinical practices. 

FY2018 performance and targets 

In FY2018, the organisation has not identified any non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary 

codes concerning the health and safety impacts of its products and services. Going forward, we aim to 

maintain our record for FY2019. We also aim to establish a baseline for FY2019 and derive indicators 

relating to safety in the workplace.

Marketing and Labelling  

[GRI 103-1 |103-2 | 103-3 | 417-2 | 417-3] 

 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

NSG is committed to the fair and responsible marketing of its products and services to its customers 

and stakeholders, including the transparent communication of the economic, environmental and social 

impacts of its brands, products and services.  Any breach of marketing and labelling standards for our 

healthcare division could potentially also lead to customer health and safety issues, which is why the 

Group places a material emphasis on this topic.  

Our management approach 

All professionals practising in our clinics under HSI are required to be registered and comply with the 

Codes and Conduct and guidelines of their respective professional bodies, including those of the 

Singapore Medical Council, the Singapore Dental Council and the Traditional Chinese Medicine 

Practitioners Board, each with their respective guidelines on ethical advertising. All medical practitioners 

are also required to conform to the Advertising Guidelines made pursuant to the Private Hospitals and 

Medical Clinics Act (PHMCA) or the new Healthcare Services Bill.  

FY2018 performance and targets 

In FY2018, the organisation has not identified any incidents of non-compliance with regulations resulting 

in a fine/penalty, a warning, or with voluntary codes related to product and service information and 

labelling, and with matters related to marketing communications, including advertising, promotion and 

sponsorship. Going forward, we aim to continue to comply with the rules within the PHMCA and Codes 

and Conduct and guidelines established by the professional bodies.

Customer Privacy 

[GRI 103-1 |103-2 | 103-3 | 418-1] 

 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

The safeguarding of our customers’ private information is of paramount importance to NSG, especially 

when the organisation deals with information as sensitive as the health data of its patients. Therefore, 

the continued success of the Group’s performance is dependent on us maintaining the highest standards 

of how our customers’ personal data is being collected, handled and protected, and we are committed 

to doing so in relation to our business operations.  

Our management approach 

To meet NSG’s obligations under the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), NSG issued a notice to all 

employees in 2018 regarding their obligations and roles under the Act as NSG staff. The notice 

introduced the Group’s Privacy and Personal Data Protection Policies, which laid out our position and 

guidelines on the collection of personal data from our existing and prospective customers, business 

associates and employees, among others, and how we protect the use of these data. Additionally, our 

clinical SOPs also included guidelines for clinical assistants to safeguard patients’ confidentiality.  

NSG takes the adherence of these policies very seriously and all staff has been notified of the potential 

of disciplinary action in the event of a breach. To ensure enforcement, we have appointed a dedicated 

Data Protection Officer, which can be reached at dpo@newsilkroutes.org.  

FY2018 performance and targets 

In FY2018, the organisation has not received any substantiated complaints concerning breaches of 

customer privacy from outside parties, regulatory bodies, nor recorded any incidents of leaks, thefts, or 

losses of customer data.   

Going forward, we aim to maintain our record for FY 2019. We will continue to work with our vendor to 

ensure adequate cyber security over our patient database, including exploring the installation of 

additional IT security enhancements such as user IDs and passwords, user access control, automatic 

lock-out of unattended computers, etc. We also intend to establish a company intranet, or equivalent, 

to facilitate sharing of our Privacy and Personal Data Protection policy documents with all employees.
