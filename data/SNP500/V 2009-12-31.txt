VISA INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December 31, 2009
 (unaudited)  (in millions, except as noted)  Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Organization—Visa Inc. (“Visa” or the “Company”) is a global payments technology company that connects consumers,
businesses, banks and governments around the world, enabling them to use digital currency instead of cash and checks. Visa and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (“Visa U.S.A.”), Visa International Service
Association (“Visa International”), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited (“VWPL”), Visa Canada Corporation (“Visa Canada”) and Inovant LLC (“Inovant”), operate the world’s largest retail electronic payments
network. The Company provides financial institutions with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments, and facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among
financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. The Company does not issue cards, set fees, or determine the interest rates consumers will be charged on Visa-branded cards, which are the independent responsibility
of the Company’s issuing customers.  Consolidation and basis of presentation—The accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Visa Inc. and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Company consolidates all
entities that are controlled by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Certain reclassifications, not affecting net income attributable to Visa, have been made to prior period information to conform to the current period presentation format, including the reclassification of $24 million of contractor expense, which was
previously reported in professional and consulting fees, to personnel for the quarter ended December 31, 2008.  The Company began
to report non-controlling interest (previously referred to as minority interest) as a component of equity in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and for all comparable periods presented as required under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810. The
impact of reporting non-controlling interest is financial statement presentation only.  The accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements of Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by GAAP.
Reference should be made to the Visa Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2009 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies.  Subsequent events have been evaluated through February 3, 2010, the date this quarterly report was filed with the SEC.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  In
September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2009-12, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures – Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset
Value per Share. ASU 2009-12 allows companies that have investments that are within the scope of this ASU to use net asset value per share as a fair value measurement without further adjustment as a practical expedient. The Company adopted this
standard

Table of Contents
VISA INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)   

in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Additional disclosures required under this ASU are not presented because
the related investments are not material to the overall consolidated financial statements.  In October 2009, ASU 2009-13 was issued
which addresses the accounting for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services (deliverables) separately rather than as a combined unit. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
ASU 2009-13, which is effective for the Company at the beginning of fiscal 2011, on its consolidated financial statements.  In January
2010, ASU 2010-06 was issued which requires new disclosures for fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The ASU also requires additional information in the roll-forward
of Level 3 fair value measurements including the presentation of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis. Further clarification for existing disclosure requirements provides for the disaggregation of assets and liabilities
presented, and the enhancement of disclosures around inputs and valuation techniques. This ASU impacts disclosures only and is effective for the Company in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, with the exception of the additional information in the
roll-forward for Level 3 fair value measurements, which is effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, with early adoption permitted.  Note
2—Retrospective Responsibility Plan  The Company has established several related mechanisms designed to address settled
liability and potential liability under certain litigation referred to as the covered litigation, including the retrospective responsibility plan, or the plan. In accordance with the plan, the Company established a litigation escrow account, or the
escrow account, from which settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be paid. Under the terms of the plan, when the Company funds the escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment
to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. There was no funding to the escrow account during the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The conversion rate applicable to the Company’s class B common
stock is 0.5824 class A share at December 31, 2009.  The following table sets forth the changes in the escrow account
during the three months ended December 31, 2009:

 An accrual for covered litigation is recorded when loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably
estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates information including funding decisions made by the litigation committee. The accrual related to covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account.

VISA INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)   
Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  Corporate debt securities, mortgage backed securities, other asset backed securities and auction rate securities are classified as Level 3 due to a
lack of trading in active markets and a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value. There was no change to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during the quarter ended December 31, 2009.  Visa Europe put option agreement. The Company has granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option, which if exercised, will require Visa Inc. to
purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The purchase price of the Visa Europe shares under the put option is based upon a formula that, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.’s forward
price-to-earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement), at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe’s projected sustainable adjusted net operating income for the forward 12-month period, or the adjusted
sustainable income. Visa Europe’s adjusted sustainable income is calculated under the terms of the put option agreement and includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items.  At December 31, 2009, and September 30, 2009, the Company determined the fair value of the put option to be approximately $346 million.
While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at December 31, 2009, it does not represent the actual purchase price that the Company may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or
more. The fair value of the put option represents the value of Visa Europe’s option, which under certain conditions could obligate the Company to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value. While the put option is in
fact non-transferable, its fair value represents the Company’s estimate of the amount the Company would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction.  In determining the fair value of the put option at December 31, 2009, the Company assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some
point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of 5.3x. These assumptions are consistent with those used in the valuation of the put option at September 30, 2009. At December 31, 2009, the P/E ratio
was 21.8 and the P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 4.3x. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could
be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future.  The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole
discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009. Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management’s expectation
of exercise and simply reflects the fact that the obligation resulting from the exercise of the instrument could become payable within 12 months. The liability is classified within Level 3 as the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to
exercise its option and the estimated P/E differential are unobservable inputs used to value the put option. Changes in fair value are included in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. There was no change in the fair value of the
put option during the first quarter of fiscal 2010.

  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis  Certain financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the tables above.
 Non-marketable equity investments. The Company’s strategic investments are accounted for under the cost and equity methods
and are classified as Level 3 assets due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity, and the fact that inputs used to measure the fair value are unobservable and require management judgment. During the three months ended
December 31, 2009, certain events and circumstances triggered impairment analyses for certain non-marketable equity securities which resulted in recognized losses of $1 million. At December 31, 2009, and September 30, 2009,
non-marketable equity security investments totaled $101 million and $102 million in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, respectively.  Reserve Primary Fund. The Company’s investment in the Reserve Primary Fund, or the Fund, is accounted for under the cost method of accounting and classified within prepaid expenses and other current
assets on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009. The Fund balance was $50 million and $69 million at December 31, 2009, and September 30, 2009, respectively. The investment is considered a Level 3 asset as the fair value
is estimated by discounting the Company’s pro-rata

Table of Contents
VISA INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)   

ownership of the Fund’s underlying investment holdings based upon an estimate of inherent risk. In January 2010, the Company received a further distribution from the Fund of $66 million
and in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 recorded a pre-tax gain of $16 million in investment income, net. This distribution substantially represents the Company’s remaining pro-rata ownership in the Fund, but is net of a portion reserved
by the Fund for ongoing expenses and claims. It is not possible to predict the timing of distribution, if ever, of the remaining amount reserved by the Fund. However, the Company’s pro-rata portion of this amount is not expected to be material
to the consolidated financial statements.  Debt. The estimated fair value of the Company’s debt at December 31, 2009,
and September 30, 2009 was $60 million and $64 million, respectively, based on credit ratings for similar notes.  Non-financial
assets and liabilities. In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company adopted the accounting and disclosure provisions related to the measurement of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities at fair value. Long-lived assets such as
goodwill, finite-lived intangible assets, and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets, and are measured at fair value only when impairment indicators exist. The Company does not have any significant non-financial
liabilities. During the three months ended December 31, 2009, there was no indication that the Company’s long-lived assets were impaired, and accordingly, measurement at fair value was not required.  Note 4—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits  The Company sponsors various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans which provide retirement and health benefits for substantially all employees residing in the United States. 
The components of net periodic benefit cost are as follows:

  Note 5—Settlement Guarantee Management  The indemnification for settlement losses that Visa provides to its customers creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of
subsequent settlement. The term and amount of the indemnification are unlimited. The Company requires certain customers that do not meet its credit standards to post collateral. The Company’s estimated maximum settlement exposure was
approximately $43.8 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to $41.8 billion at September 30, 2009. Of these amounts, $3.9 billion at December 31, 2009 and $3.7 billion at September 30, 2009, are covered by collateral. The total
available collateral

balances presented below are greater than the settlement exposure covered by customer collateral held due to instances in which the available collateral exceeds the total settlement exposure for
certain financial institutions at each date presented.  Cash equivalents collateral is reflected in customer collateral on the
consolidated balance sheet as it is held in escrow in the Company’s name. All other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheet. Pledged securities are held by third parties in trust for the Company and customers. Guarantees are
provided primarily by parent financial institutions to secure the obligations of their subsidiaries, and the Company routinely evaluates the financial viability of institutions providing the guarantees.  The Company maintained collateral as follows:

740 2009 Accelerated Class C Share Release Program
 During the three months ended December 31, 2009, an additional 3 million shares were converted from class C common stock
to class A common stock upon the sale or transfer by the class C shareholders into the public market. Of the 40 million shares of class C common stock released from transfer restrictions under this program, 16 million shares remain
available for sale or transfer, subject to certain terms and conditions, at December 31, 2009. There is no dilutive effect to the outstanding share count from these transactions.

2010 Class C Share Release Program  On January 21, 2010, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved the release of additional class C shares. The number of shares
released for any class C shareholder will be the greater of (a) 50% (fifty percent) of the restricted class C shares held by that shareholder as of March 1, 2010, and (b) 5,000 (five thousand) class C shares. Shareholder
application will not be required. The shares will automatically become eligible for public sale on March 8, 2010. The remaining restricted class C shares will continue to be subject to the general transfer restrictions that expire on
March 25, 2011, under Visa’s certificate of incorporation. Class C shares sold in the public market upon release under this program will automatically convert to class A shares. Approximately 56 million class C shares are expected to
be released from transfer restrictions. The release of the class C shares will not increase the number of outstanding shares on an as-converted basis of the Company’s common stock, and there will be no dilutive effect to the outstanding class A
common stock share count on an as-converted basis.  Share Repurchase Plan  In October 2009, the Company’s board of directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase plan. The authorization will be in place through
September 30, 2010, and is subject to extension or expansion at the determination of the Company’s board of directors. Under this plan, the Company repurchased 5.5 million shares of its class A common stock at an average price of
$78.78 per share for a total cost of $432 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Repurchased shares have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. At December 31, 2009, the share repurchase plan has remaining
authorized funds of $568 million.  Dividends Declared  On January 20, 2010, the Company’s board of directors declared a dividend in the amount of $0.125 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an
as-converted basis) which will be paid on March 2, 2010, to all holders of record of the Company’s class A, class B, and class C common stock as of February 12, 2010.  Stock Dividends Received from Cost Method Investees  During the first quarter of fiscal 2010,
the Company retired the 24,449 shares of treasury stock received from cost method investees in the first half of fiscal 2009. The Company has no class C common treasury stock outstanding at December 31, 2009.  Note 7—Earnings Per Share  During the
first quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company adopted a new accounting standard which defines unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents as participating securities and requires these
securities to be included in computing earnings per share under the two-class method. The Company’s unvested restricted stock awards and unvested restricted stock units are considered participating securities and have been included in the
computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Comparable prior period earnings per share data have been recomputed to conform to current period presentation. There was no change to the basic and diluted earnings per share previously
reported for the three months ended December 31, 2008, as a result of this adoption.

(1)
 The calculation of diluted class A earnings per share considers, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period
consisting of: (1) incremental shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of class B and class C common stock based on the conversion rate in effect through the period, (2) participating securities in the form of unvested
restricted stock awards and unvested restricted stock units, and (3) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options and the assumed vesting of
unearned performance shares. The computation of average dilutive shares outstanding excluded stock options to purchase 1 million and 10 million shares of common stock for the three months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, because their effect would be antidilutive. 


(2)
 Net income attributable to Visa is allocated to each class and series of common stock on an as-converted basis. On an as-converted basis and for the purpose of
calculating net income attributable to Visa allocated to each class and series of common stock, the weighted average numbers of shares of class B common stock outstanding on an as-converted basis used in the allocation are 143 million and
172 million for the three months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 


(3)
 Net income attributable to Visa was allocated to the redeemed common stock for the period during which they were outstanding.

VISA INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)   
Note 8—Share-based Compensation  During the three months ended December 31, 2009, the Company granted 961,967 non-qualified stock options, or options, 846,648 restricted stock
awards, or RSAs, and 241,661 restricted stock units, or RSUs, to Company employees and non-employee directors under the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan. The options had a weighted average exercise price per share of $79.59 and a weighted
average grant date fair value per share of $29.49. The RSAs and RSUs had weighted average grant date fair values per share of $79.59. The Company accounted for these awards using the straight-line method of attribution for expensing equity awards
with only service conditions. Compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures, which are adjusted as appropriate.  The
Company also granted performance-based shares during the quarter ended December 31, 2009. The ultimate number of performance shares to be earned will be between zero and 203,006, depending on the Company’s achievement of specified
cumulative net income performance targets, and the Company’s stock price ranked against the total shareholder return of companies that are included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index during the approximate two-year period
beginning October 28, 2009. These earned performance shares vest in two equal installments on November 30, 2011 and 2012, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. The grant-date fair value of the performance-based
shares, incorporating the market condition by using a Monte Carlo simulation model, was $88.06 per share. Compensation expense for the performance awards is initially estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate throughout
the performance period. For awards with performance conditions, the Company uses the graded-vesting method of expense attribution. Compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures, which are adjusted as appropriate.  Note 9—Income Taxes  The effective income
tax rates were 37% and 40% for the three months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The rate for the three months ended December 31, 2009 was lower than the rate for the comparable period in the prior year primarily due to
changes in the geographic mix of the Company’s global income and the benefit of Singapore tax incentives.  Note 10—Legal Matters
 The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject
to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not
relate to a probable loss and/or amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could in the future incur judgments or fines or enter
into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  The Company’s litigation provision was ($43) million and less than $1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The credit to the provision in the three months ended
December 31, 2009, is primarily a result of a $41 million pre-tax gain recognized related to the prepayment of the remaining obligations under the Retailers’ litigation (discussed in Other Litigation below). The litigation accrual
is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its

litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet date. From time to time, the
Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties.  The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation for both covered and other non-covered litigation for the three months ended

 This amount includes the reduction to the provision for the $41 million pre-tax gain recognized related to the prepayment of the remaining obligations under the
Retailers’ litigation. 


(2)
 This balance represents the amount of
the Discover settlement refunded to the Company during fiscal 2009 by Morgan Stanley under a separate agreement. 


(3)
 This amount includes the
Company’s October 2009 prepayment of its remaining $800 million in payment obligations in the Retailers’ litigation at a discounted amount of $682 million.  Covered Litigation  Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain
legal proceedings discussed below that are subject to the retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the covered litigation. See Note 2—Retrospective Responsibility Plan. An accrual for covered litigation is
recorded when loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination the Company evaluates available information, including funding decisions made by the litigation committee. The accrual related to covered litigation
could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance.  The Attridge Litigation  In the separate California “Indirect Purchaser” Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases also pending in California state court, Visa entered
into a settlement agreement on September 14, 2009. That settlement agreement, which was subsequently amended and is subject to the approval of the court in those cases, also could potentially have the effect of releasing the claims asserted in
the Attridge case, subject to the ruling of the Attridge court.  Other Litigation  Retailers’ Litigation  On
October 2, 2009, the court entered a final order approving the prepayment agreement, and Visa made the $682 million prepayment pursuant to the agreement’s terms on October 5, 2009. Pursuant to its terms, the prepayment agreement
became final after no appeals to the approval order were filed within the 30-day appeal period.

VISA INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)   
“Indirect Purchaser” Actions  In California (Credit/Debit Card Tying Cases), after the parties amended the settlement agreement in certain respects, the court entered an
order preliminarily approving the settlement on January 5, 2010 and scheduled a final approval hearing for July 16, 2010.  Currency Conversion Litigation  Various appeals have been filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
challenging the district court’s approval of the settlement. The issuance of refund checks for valid, timely claims will not commence until after the appeals are resolved (in favor of the court-approved settlement) and the settlement
administrator has validated the claims.  State Investigative Demands  The Office of the Attorney General of Texas issued a Civil Investigative Demand, or “CID”, to Visa Inc. on October 9, 2009 seeking
information regarding a potential violation of Sections 15.05 of the Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act of 1983, Texas’s antitrust law. The CID seeks narrative responses to interrogatories that focus on certain Visa U.S.A. policies
relating to merchant acceptance practices, including Visa U.S.A.’s policies regarding merchant surcharging and merchants’ ability to steer customers to other forms of payment.  On January 7, 2010, the Attorney General of the State of Missouri issued a CID to Visa requiring Visa to produce the same documents sought by the
Ohio Investigative Demand. Visa Inc. is cooperating with the state Attorneys General in connection with these requests.  Brazilian
Competition Authority Proceedings  On December 16, 2009, Visa International and Visa do Brasil reached an agreement with CADE
for the immediate suspension of the investigation and its eventual closure without fines if certain conditions are met. The terms of the settlement are not considered material to the consolidated financial statements.  Gift Card Litigation  Visa is a
party to various lawsuits involving prepaid gift cards. Pursuant to existing agreements, Visa may be indemnified by the issuer of the gift card in question for liability associated with some or all of the claims asserted in these suits. 
Loiseau/Barclay  On
November 24, 2009, Loiseau filed his third amended complaint. Both Visa and Metabank moved to dismiss that complaint.  On
December 1, 2009, by the same counsel as Mr. Loiseau, William Barclay filed a putative class action against Visa U.S.A. and Metabank making similar allegations as in the Loiseau case. On December 31, 2009, Metabank removed the Barclay
action to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California and filed a notice of relatedness between the two cases.

The Reserve Primary Fund  On November 25, 2009, the court accepted most aspects of the SEC plan and ordered that the remaining assets in the Fund, with the exception of a
reserve for ongoing expenses and claims, be returned to investors on a pro-rata basis. On January 29, 2010, Visa U.S.A. received a further distribution from the Fund of $66 million. Together with interim distributions, Visa U.S.A. has received to
date, a total payout of 99% of Visa U.S.A.’s original investment.  Intellectual Property Litigation  Vale Canjeable  On
August 6, 2008, the Commercial Chamber of the Supreme Court in Venezuela (the “Supreme Court”) accepted the defendants’ extraordinary appeal and declared the lower court’s decision null and void, ordering a new Superior
Tribunal to rule on the defendants’ appeal of the preliminary injunction. Pursuant to the Supreme Court’s order, on March 25, 2009, the First Superior Tribunal of Caracas issued a new decision. The decision (i) dismissed the
defendants’ appeal; (ii) ratified the preliminary injunction; and (iii) found the defendants liable for legal fees and costs in connection with the appeal. On July 9, 2009, the defendants filed a further extraordinary appeal to
the Supreme Court as to the March 25, 2009 decision. On December 10, 2009, the Supreme Court again accepted the defendants’ extraordinary appeal, declared null and void the March 25 ruling, and ordered a new Superior Tribunal to
rule on the defendants’ appeal of the preliminary injunction.  TQP Development, LLC—Data Encryption  On December 21, 2009, the parties executed an agreement to settle the litigation, and the case was dismissed with prejudice on January 4,
2010. The settlement amount is not considered material to the consolidated financial statements.  Restricted Spending Solutions,
LLC—Prepaid and Commercial Cards  On November 19, 2009, Visa U.S.A. filed its First Amended Answer and Counterclaim to
plaintiff’s complaint.

ITEM 2.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  This management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital
resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Visa,” “we,” “our” and “the Company”) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect
future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Visa Inc.’s unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.  Forward-Looking statements  This Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are subject to the “safe
harbor” created by those sections. These statements can be identified by the terms “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,”
“may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “will” and similar expressions which are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  By their nature, forward-looking statements: (i) speak only as of the date they are made, (ii) are not guarantees of future performance or
results and (iii) are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from those forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of
factors, including all the risks discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part 1, Item 1A – “Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Periodic
Reports on Form 8-K, if any. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Unless required to do so under U.S. federal securities laws or other applicable laws, we do not intend to
update or revise any forward-looking statements.  Overview  Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, banks and governments around the world, enabling them to use digital currency instead of checks and cash. We provide financial
institutions with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers,
businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth
opportunities. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services to benefit our existing customers and to position Visa to serve more and different constituencies.
 Overall Economic Conditions  Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. We expect that soft economic conditions will continue to moderate consumer and commercial spending, and our rate of payments volume
growth, in the near term and will continue to monitor the progress over the course of the global economic recovery. Regulatory measures enacted in the United States in fiscal 2009 expected to take effect in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 will
impact our financial institution customers. Should financial institutions constrict credit offerings in response to these measures, this could ultimately impact consumer spending and our payments volume. However, we believe that the continuing
secular shift to electronic payment products for non-discretionary spending will buffer the
  
22 


Table of Contents

impact to our overall payments volume growth. This shift is particularly clear in debit products, where Visa has a strong market position in the United States and significant growth opportunities
internationally.  Share Repurchase Plan  In October 2009, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase plan. The authorization will be in place through September 30, 2010, and is subject to extension or expansion at the
determination of our board of directors. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we repurchased 5.5 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $78.78 per share for a total cost of $432 million. As of the end of the first
fiscal quarter, $568 million remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for further discussion.  Nominal Payments Volume and Transaction Counts  We believe that payments volume and processed transactions are key drivers of our business. Payments volume is the basis for service revenues and processed transactions are the basis for data processing revenues.
Compared to the same prior year period, nominal payments volume declined in commercial products, offset by growth in consumer debit and credit, resulting in a moderate increase in overall nominal payments volume year over year. The number of
processed transactions continues to increase reflecting the continued shift to electronic payments globally.  This
table sets forth nominal product payments volume for the periods presented in nominal dollars(1):

 Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for
goods and services that are purchased. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balances access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution customers,
subject to verification by Visa. From time to time, previously submitted volume information may be updated. Prior year volume information presented in these tables has not been updated, as subsequent adjustments were not material.

 Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported with respect to the three
months ended December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, were based on payments volume reported by our financial institution customers for the three months ended September 30, 2009, and September 30, 2008, respectively.

 Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers.  Growth in operating revenues primarily reflects a moderate increase in nominal payments volume, continued growth of processed transactions, and the
impact of pricing modifications made on various services as a result of innovations in our product line and improvements in our service model. The benefits of pricing modifications are partially offset by increases to volume and support incentives.
We regularly review our pricing strategy to ensure that it competitively aligns with the value and growth opportunities provided to our customers.  A significant portion of the revenues we earn outside the United States results from cross-border business and leisure travel, which has shown signs of moderate improvement in most regions in the first fiscal
quarter. Revenues from processing cross-border transactions for our customers fluctuate with cross-border travel and the extent to which Visa-branded products are utilized for travel purposes.  Our operating revenues are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Operating revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or
weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to local or regional currencies in which our payments volume are denominated. The general weakening of the U.S. dollar in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 over the prior year comparable period was moderated by
our hedging activities. Currency fluctuation primarily impacted service and international transaction revenues.

(1)
 Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers.   


 
•
 
 Service revenues increased primarily due to modest growth of 3% in nominal payments volume combined with strategic pricing modifications implemented after
the second quarter of fiscal 2009. We continue to monitor the progress of nominal payments volume growth as part of the overall global economic recovery.   


 
•
 
 Data processing revenues increased due to competitive pricing adjustments which became effective in the second half of fiscal 2009 across various regions
combined with 12% growth in the number of transactions processed. We believe that the secular shift to electronic payments will continue on a global basis.   


 
•
 
 International transaction revenues increased due to a growth of 8% in nominal cross-border payments volume, combined with strategic pricing modifications
which took place after the second quarter of fiscal 2009.   


 
•
 
 Other revenues increased primarily due to license fees from Cielo, formerly known as Companhia Brasileira de Meois de Pagamento, or VisaNet do Brasil, for
the use of Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property. We entered into this licensing arrangement with VisaNet do Brasil following their initial public offering and the sale of our investment interest in the third quarter of fiscal 2009.
Additionally, the increase also reflects continued growth in the Visa Extras loyalty platform and the administrative and rewards fulfillment services performed in support of the platform, and other new license and royalty fees.
  


 
•
 
 Volume and support incentives increased primarily due to incentives incurred on significant long-term customer contracts that were initiated or renewed
after the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The increase in incentives is also attributable to the absence of $19 million downward performance adjustments included in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, reflective of the economic environment at the time.

 Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers.   


 
•
 
 Personnel decreased primarily due to the absence of larger severances incurred in the prior year associated with workforce consolidation and elimination
of overlapping functions. We reclassified contractor expenses to personnel from professional and consulting fees in the prior year to conform to the current year presentation. Contractor expense decreased in the current quarter reflecting the
effective implementation of our global strategy to reduce cost.   


 
•
 
 Network, EDP and communications increased primarily due to higher fees paid for debit processing services related to processing transactions through
non-Visa networks.   


 
•
 
 Advertising, marketing and promotion increased slightly over the prior year. We anticipate a larger increase compared to prior year during the second and
third quarters of fiscal 2010 due to increased spending in connection with the 2010 Winter Olympics and FIFA World Cup

campaigns. We continue to review and refine our marketing and advertising spending globally to ensure it is consistent with our overall strategy to reduce cost.   


 
•
 
 Professional and consulting fees decreased primarily reflecting the absence of legal fees incurred in connection with the Discover settlement in October
2008.   


 
•
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased as expected reflecting charges related to the new data center and office building that were placed in service
during the second half of fiscal 2009.   


 
•
 
 Administrative and other expense increased primarily due to unrealized foreign exchange losses recorded upon the remeasurement of monetary assets and
liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currencies, combined with the absence of foreign exchange gains recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.   


 
•
 
 Litigation provision primarily reflects the $41 million pre-tax gain recorded in the current quarter as a result of prepaying the remaining obligation
under the Retailers’ litigation settlement, as well as release of additional accruals for other matters settled during the quarter. The gain reflects the difference between our prepayment amount of $682 million and the carrying value of the
obligation. There were no significant new litigation accruals made during the current quarter.  Other Income (Expense)

•
 
 Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower interest accretion from declining litigation balances. See Note 10—Legal Matters.
  


 
•
 
 Investment income, net decreased due to lower interest earned in the current quarter as a result of lower interest rates and declining investment
balances, which reflect the use of $682 million to pre-pay the Retailers’ litigation and the use of $432 million to repurchase class A common stock under the Share Repurchase Plan.  Income Taxes  Our effective income tax rate is
a combination of federal, state and foreign statutory rates and certain required adjustments to taxable income. The effective income tax rates were 37% and 40% for the three months ended December 31, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The rate for
the three months ended December 31, 2009 was lower than the rate for the same period in the prior year primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of our global income and the benefit of Singapore tax incentives.

  Cash used in operating activities during the three months ended December 31, 2009, consisted of net income
including non-controlling interest of $763 million and adjustments for non-cash items of $520 million, primarily amortization of volume and support incentives. Cash used in operating activities during the three months ended December 31, 2009
primarily reflects the $682 million prepayment of our Retailers’ litigation obligation as further discussed below. Cash from operating activities in both periods also reflects other significant operational payments including those related to
settlement transactions, other litigation settlement payments, volume and support incentives, and our annual compensation benefits. We believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will sufficiently meet the demands of our ongoing
operational needs.  Cash provided by investing activities during the three months ended December 31, 2009, primarily reflects net
cash proceeds of $41 million from the sales and maturities of investment securities compared to $195 million in the prior year, both of which were reinvested in money market funds. We also received a $19 million cash distribution from the Reserve
Primary Fund, or the Fund, in the current quarter compared to $775 million of distribution in the prior year. Both periods’ net cash proceeds were offset by purchases of property, equipment and technology, which were lower this quarter
reflecting the completion of our east coast data center in fiscal 2009. We expect capital expenditures to increase during the remaining quarters of fiscal 2010 as capital projects are reviewed and approved.  Cash used in financing activities during the three months ended December 31, 2009, consisted primarily of $432 million in repurchases of class A
common stock in the open market and $93 million of quarterly dividend payments as further discussed below. Comparatively, cash used in financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2008, reflects redemption of our class C (series
II) and class C (series III) liability shares for $2.6 billion, funding of $1.1 billion to the litigation escrow account and quarterly dividend payment of $81 million, offset by funding of covered litigation payments totaling $397 million covered by
the litigation escrow account.  Liquidity  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, an investment portfolio, and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and
cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investment securities, or long- term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and return that these holdings provide.
 There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2009, except as discussed below. Based
on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term
  
28 


Table of Contents

and long-term liquidity needs, management believes that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. Management
will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances.  Other Litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. In
connection with our Retailers’ litigation settlement in fiscal 2003, we were required to make annual settlement payments of $200 million through fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2009, we entered into an agreement to modify our remaining payment
obligations under the original Retailers’ litigation settlement agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, on October 5, 2009, we made a payment of $682 million to fully satisfy the remaining $800 million obligation.  Share Repurchase Plan. In October 2009, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase plan. The authorization will be in
place through September 30, 2010, and is subject to extension or expansion at the determination of our board of directors. During the three months ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased 5.5 million shares of our outstanding class A
common stock at an average price of $78.78 per share in the open market for a total cost of $432 million. At December 31, 2009, the share repurchase plan has remaining authorized funds of $568 million.  Dividends. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we paid $93 million in dividends. On January 20, 2010, our board of directors declared
a dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.125 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $93 million in connection with this dividend in
March 2010. See Note 6—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for further information regarding dividend declarations. We intend to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to
approval by our board of directors.  Visa Europe put-call option agreement. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put
option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. At December 31, 2009, the fair value of the put option
liability was $346 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at December 31, 2009, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we
could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation, which could be several billion dollars or more. We may need to obtain third-party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent
equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europe’s adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as determined at the time
the put option is exercised.  Fair Value Measurements—Financial Instruments  The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party
would use in pricing an asset or liability.  As of December 31, 2009, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a
recurring basis included approximately $5.7 billion of assets, of which $31 million, or less than 1%, had significant unobservable inputs. For these instruments, we lacked observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus
prices or the non-binding broker quotes. Marketable debt

instruments in this category include corporate debt securities, mortgage backed securities, other asset backed securities and auction rate securities. See Note 3—Fair Value
Measurements to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.   


ITEM 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency rates, interest rates and
equity prices. We do not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis, and cash and cash equivalents are not considered to be subject to
significant interest rate risk due to the short period of time to maturity. There have been no significant changes to our market risks during the three months ended December 31, 2009, compared to September 30, 2009.   


ITEM 4.
Controls and Procedures  Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) of Visa Inc. at the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, at the end of such period, the disclosure controls and procedures of Visa Inc. were effective in alerting them, on a timely basis, to material information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or furnish under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  There has been no change in the internal control over financial reporting of Visa Inc. that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this report
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

approximately $568 million remaining under the plan. 


(2)
 Includes 140,720 shares of class A common stock withheld at an average price of $79.59 per share (under the terms of grants under the Company’s
