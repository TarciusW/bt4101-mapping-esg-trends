TalkMed Group is pleased to present our fourth Sustainability 

Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2020. Our 

report documents our sustainability performance, progress 

and the initiatives we have adopted to meet our stakeholders’ 

expectations.

ENVIRONMENT

We are aware of our responsibility to conduct our business in 

an environmentally responsible manner. We strive to minimise 

the harmful environmental impacts of our day-to-day practices 

and integrate sustainable practices across all business 

operations. Through sustainability reporting, we would be 

able to track the progress of our initiatives and create greater 

environmental consciousness among our community.

At TalkMed, we understand the dangerous effects of improper 

handling and disposal of medical waste on the environment 

as well as the society. We are therefore committed to 

adopt the best practices and ensure compliance with all 

relevant regulations. This helps minimise the risk of disease 

transmission, air and water contamination, as well as soil 

pollution. We hire licensed and experienced firms to collect, 

transport and dispose of any biohazardous and cytotoxic 

waste.

SOCIAL

As a medical service provider, we understand the importance 

of attracting and retaining talented employees to provide 

exceptional service to our customers. We are committed to 

enforcing fair labour practices, providing equal opportunities 

and providing a safe working environment for all our 

employees.

At TalkMed, we have created a culture that fosters innovation 

and encourage our medical staff to stay up to date with 

the latest development in their field. We provide them with 

diverse training opportunities and support their professional 

as well as personal development. This helps them to be aware 

of the latest medical advancement, treatment methods and 

equipment available in the market and allows them to make 

well-informed decisions for our customers.

Our ultimate goal is to provide quality and safe patient care that 

exceeds industry standards and responds to the needs of our 

customers. We believe that maintaining a safe environment 

is a crucial aspect of competent healthcare. To protect the 

safety of both patients and our healthcare professionals, we 

ensure strict adherence to all applicable rules and regulations.

TalkMed values its employees, customers and the community 

it serves. Our doctors play their part by providing health 

education to the people. They share their knowledge and 

contribute to raising disease awareness in Singapore and 

neighbouring countries via newspapers, magazines, medical 

journals and medical educational sessions.

COMMUNITY

We strive to have a positive impact on our community and 

have collaborated with the Singapore Cancer Society to create 

a difference. As part of our local initiatives, we sponsored and 

participated in the “Relay for Life” event in Singapore.

GOVERNANCE

We understand our role as a member of the medical 

fraternity and uphold the highest standards of corporate 

governance across all our business functions. To demonstrate 

our commitment to business ethics, we have included 

anti-corruption as one of the material topics in our report to 

disclose our practices, policies and performance. We strictly 

adhere to the compliance requirements of a public listed 

company and are committed to providing transparent and 

relevant information to all our stakeholders on a timely basis.

TalkMed believes our responsibility as a healthcare group 

goes beyond our business operations. We are committed to 

look for ways to enhance our services and use our resources 

responsibly. We strive for medical excellence and aim to 

provide the safest services to our valuable customers. We 

want to thank our stakeholders for their continuous trust and 

support in our sustainability journey.

(1) The Group exercises control over and derives economic benefits from the remaining 30% interest in the entity through contractual 

arrangements.

TalkMed and its group of companies (collectively, the “Group”) is a premier provider of medical oncology services, stem cell 

transplant services and palliative healthcare services. We are headquartered in Singapore and our operations extend to serve 

the markets in Vietnam and China as well.

TalkMed was incorporated on 10 September 2013 and listed on the Catalist Board of Singapore Exchange Securities Trading 

Limited on 30 January 2014. TalkMed’s group structure as of May 2021 is as follows:

Singapore Cancer Centre Pte. Ltd. (“SCC”) provides tertiary 

healthcare services to the oncology patients in the private 

sector in Singapore, through Parkway Cancer Centre 

(“PCC”). Our highly-trained doctors attend to patients, 

examine and administer medical treatments, perform minor 

outpatient surgical procedures, prescribe medicines and 

conduct laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures. In addition 

to the above clinical functions, we review the results of these 

investigations and provide follow-up patient care.

TalkMed is recognised as one of the leading medical tourism 

facilities in Singapore. This has been made possible by the 

excellent medical services provided by our team of fifteen 

doctors at nine clinics in facilities operated by Parkway 

Hospitals Singapore Pte. Ltd.. These include Gleneagles 

Hospital Singapore, Mount Elizabeth Hospital Singapore, 

Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre and Mount Elizabeth Novena 

Specialist Centre. For the past few years, SCC has established 

itself as one of the market leaders in medical tourism in 

Singapore with foreign patients accounting for approximately 

half of its patient- load.

TalkMed Vietnam Pte. Ltd. was established in March 2014 and 

we collaborated with Thu Cuc International General Hospital 

to set up a medical centre known as Singapore Cancer Centre 

Thu Cuc. The centre provides specialist medical oncology 

services in Hanoi, Vietnam.

In November 2019, TalkMed Greater China Pte. Ltd. 

was incorporated pursuant to a restructuring exercise to 

consolidate and streamline the Group’s projects in the People’s 

Republic of China (“PRC”). It is used by the Group as a vehicle 

to hold its current projects in Beijing and Chongqing through 

TalkMed China Pte. Ltd. (“TMC”) and TalkMed Chongqing 

Pte. Ltd. (“TMCQ”) respectively as well as to explore future 

healthcare-related projects collaborations in the PRC.

Beijing

The Group has a 100% deemed interest in Beijing Yachuang 

Siwei Investment Management Co., Ltd. (“Yachuang”), after 

TMC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group acquired 70% 

of the total issued and paid-up share capital of Yachuang 

in January 2020. The remaining 30% stake is held through 

an entity controlled by the Group through contractual 

arrangements.

Yachuang is principally engaged in the business of investment 

management, 

hospital 

management, 

and 

healthcare 

management and consultancy (excluding diagnosis and 

treatment). Yachuang’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Beijing Deyi 

Shanshui Clinic Co., Ltd., will operate a private medical centre 

in Beijing, offering premier and quality oncology services as well 

as ancillary services to support oncology patients in the PRC.

TalkMed Hospital Management (Beijing) Co., Ltd. is 100% 

owned by TMC, and its principal activity is to provide hospital 

management and advisory services in the PRC.

Chongqing

TMCQ, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, was 

incorporated with the aim to provide healthcare management 

services in Chongqing, PRC. TMCQ has jointly established a 

sino-foreign joint venture enterprise, Sino-Singapore Hospital 

Management (Chongqing) Co., Ltd. (“SSHM”) in Chongqing, 

PRC, with Chongqing Yongchuan District People’s Hospital 

(“YCDPH”). TMCQ and YCDPH hold 60% and 40% of the 

equity interests in SSHM respectively. SSHM has established 

Sino-Singapore Cancer Centre, a category 2A oncology 

hospital, which is located in Yongchuan, Western Chongqing 

that offers a comprehensive suite of services from cancer 

diagnosis to cancer treatment as well as post-treatment care 

to cancer patients in the PRC.

At TalkMed, we understand the importance of engaging our stakeholders and identifying the material issues that are most 

important to them. We selected our key stakeholder group based on influence, representation, responsibility, dependency and 

proximity.

We have identified the key material issues through a process of identification, prioritisation and validation via a stakeholder 

engagement conducted previously.

We firmly believe that stakeholder engagement is a key factor to ensure the success of our business. Therefore, we constantly 

seek to improve our communication channels with all our stakeholders to seek their inputs as well as address their concerns.

The content and aspect boundaries in this report have been developed in alignment with the GRI Reporting Principles of 

Materiality, Stakeholder Inclusiveness, Sustainability Context and Completeness. Our key stakeholders were engaged through 

carefully formulated surveys to understand their areas of concern.

TalkMed conducted a peer benchmarking exercise in the financial year ended 31 December 2019 (“FY19”). We compared 

the material topics and disclosures against our top local and national peers to assess gaps and identify areas of improvement. 

After analysing the findings from the exercise, we have refreshed our material aspects and selected “Anti-corruption” as an 

additional material aspect to be included in our Sustainability Report from FY19 onwards.

We are committed to updating our materiality assessment biennially.

ANTI-CORRUPTION

GRI 103-1 | 103-2 | 103-3 | 205-3

Why is this a material issue?

TalkMed adheres to the highest standards of business integrity, ethics and transparency. Corruption in any form undermines 

the capability of healthcare organisations to contribute to better health and to serve their customers well. Hence, it is important 

for us to keep our corruption risk low through good corporate governance, business ethics and strong internal controls in our 

business processes.

As a medical services provider, we take this issue very seriously and are committed to complying with all applicable standards, 

rules and regulations necessary to prevent corruption and unethical behaviour.

Our approach to managing

At TalkMed, we have zero tolerance for all forms of corruption, bribery, fraud and unethical behavior. This is reflected in our 

Code of Conduct, which outlines the guidelines for maintaining transparency and accountability.

We have also established a whistle-blowing policy which will stipulate the mechanism by which concerns about plausible 

improprieties in matters of financial reporting may be raised. A dedicated secured email address allows whistle-blowers direct 

access to the Audit and Risk Committee.

The whistle-blowing policy and its procedures have also been made available to all employees.

The Company’s whistle-blowing policy allows employees to raise concerns and offers reassurance that they will be protected 

from reprisals or victimisation for whistle-blowing in good faith.

FY20 Performance

There were no reported cases of corruption during the reporting period.

FY21(3) Target

We aim to maintain zero cases of all forms of corruption in our future business operations as well.

CUSTOMER HEALTH AND SAFETY

GRI 103-1 | 103-2 | 103-3 | 416-2

Why is this a material issue?

The safety and well-being of our customers form the core of our organisation’s value. We are committed to providing excellent 

service to our patients at all times and have taken several measures to ensure the same.

We have integrated standards and procedures across all our operations and installed continuous monitoring systems to 

safeguard the health and safety of our valued customers.

Our approach to managing

As customer safety is a crucial aspect of our business, we ensure strict adherence to government regulations such as Private 

Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act, Medicines Act, Health Products Act and Singapore Medical Council Ethical Code and Ethical 

Guidelines.

We have in place a set of clinical standard operating procedures (“SOPs”) to maintain competency among staff and compliance 

with the applicable regulations and laws.

As a provider of medical services, we believe the professional capability of our nurses is a direct reflection of the quality of our 

services. We have, therefore, put in place a system of competency checklists to assess and evaluate their proficiency. In addition 

to this, we also have an apheresis competency checklist, as our operations require handling of blood products. The above SOPs 

and checklists are reviewed every year for relevance and completeness.

FY20 Performance

There were no incidents of non-compliance concerning the health and safety impacts of products and services.

FY21 Target

TalkMed aims to continue its performance by maintaining a strong framework to ensure compliance with relevant guidelines 

and regulations.

PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY


EMPLOYMENT

GRI 103-1 | 103-2 | 103-3 | 401-1

Why is this a material issue?

Our employees are the foundation of our business and the secret to our long-lasting success. They are integral to our ability to 

provide exceptional medical services to our customers and consistently improve our performance. As they are our most valuable 

assets, we are committed to providing a challenging work environment for our workforce of talented doctors and specialists.

Our approach to managing

We are aware that our ability to attract, develop and retain highly motivated employees is critical to our business.

Our human resource team follows fair and supportive policies which are in line with our objectives. We have an equitable 

system of recognition and awards that allows doctors the opportunity to participate in revenue-sharing schemes. Our staff is 

awarded attractive year-end bonus that commensurates with their performances. In addition to the above, we provide annual 

subsidised holidays to promote staff bonding. We recognise and acknowledge the contribution of our long-serving staff by 

rewarding them with long service awards.

We aim to have the very best talent and also work towards ensuring that each role is filled by a candidate who is qualified and 

of the right fit. Therefore, we have delegated this crucial task of recruiting new doctors to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief 

Operating Officer, while the hiring of new clinical staff is entrusted to nurse management and human resource department. 

This helps us to identify candidates with high potential who can contribute meaningfully to the Group.

FY20 Performance

Total new hire rate: 5.4%

Total turnover rate: 6.5%

FY21 Target

To ensure greater retention of talent pool.

TRAINING AND EDUCATION

GRI 103-1 | 103-2 | 103-3 | 404-1

Why is this issue material?

TalkMed places a strong emphasis on developing talent through training and education programmes. It is necessary for our 

doctors and specialists to be updated with the latest development in their field to perform to the best of their abilities. 

Therefore, we provide opportunities for holistic improvement in their competency level and help them reach their full potential.

Our approach to managing

To enable employees to refine their skills, we organise regular training and development programmes to cater to their area of 

specialisation. We offer our nurses fully-sponsored diploma courses to help them upgrade their qualifications. We have fostered 

a culture of learning in our organisation and we encourage regular feedback to identify new areas of improvement.

RELAY FOR LIFE 2020

TalkMed was the title sponsor for Relay for Life (“RFL”) 2020 event. RFL is a community-based fund-raising event that takes 

place every year all around the world. Singapore is the 25th country to organise RFL and be part of this global movement. This 

event aims to bring the community together to Celebrate the triumph of survivors, Remember those lost to the disease, and 

Fight Back against a disease that has taken so much.

Unlike previous years, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic just before the event, the organiser, Singapore Cancer Society 

(“SCS”), replaced the physical event with the “SCS-TalkMed Relay for Life Virtual 100km Challenge” which took place between 

21 and 29 March 2020.

This virtual event saw almost 2,000 sign-ups forming a total of 240 teams that clocked a total of 57,417.56km. It also helped to 

raise over $800,000 which will go towards funding the programmes and services run by SCS to Minimise Cancer and Maximise 

Lives of the cancer community.
