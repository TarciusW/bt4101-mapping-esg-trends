1.2 Message to stakeholders &amp; board statement 

The Board of Spackman Entertainment is committed to 

minimising our environmental impacts, growing 

sustainably, and inspiring others to take action for the 

benefit of conserving and protecting the world we live in. 

This year, we embarked on our sustainability journey to measure and 

manage our environmental impacts through our newly implemented 

sustainability program.  

As a leading entertainment production company in Korea, we believe 

it is important for us to capitalise on the power of film and media to 

convey the message of environmental protection, not only through 

our actions of producing content but also narrating it in our content. 

With the increasing global need and desire to practise eco-friendly 

and sustainable processes to produce content, we intend to set and 

improve our policies to achieve Environmental, Social and 

Governance sustainability. 

We understand that our position in the film and drama production 

arena provides us with the unique opportunity to advocate positive 

Environment, Social and Economic narratives through our efforts 

behind the camera as well as the underlying messages relayed on 

screen. 

As such, we shall strive to comply with industry-leading sustainability 

practices in film and drama production, and also aim to raise 

awareness and inspire sustainable and socially responsible thinking 

in local and international audiences through our movie and drama 

content in the future. 

On behalf of the Board, we wish to state that the Board has 

considered sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation 

and, together with the Management, determined the material 

Environmental, Social and Governance factors, as well as overseen 

the management and monitoring of these factors in the Group’s 

sustainability journey.

3. Our performance 

3.1 How we measure our performance 

Our sustainability strategy is embedded into the appropriate parts 

of our business, with dedicated teams for each focus area, and 

coordination by our relevant departmental managers. 

Progress will be tracked in two key ways: measuring performance 

against metrics, and evaluating how well the programs have 

advanced, through a series of ‘commitments’. 

Metrics and targets 

We have established key performance indicators for each of the four 

focus areas outlined in our sustainability strategy. As this is our first 

year adopting sustainability reporting, we will be establishing targets 

within the next year to hold ourselves accountable and track how we 

are doing. 

Periodically, we plan to introduce new metrics and update targets to 

ensure alignment with our strategy. 

Commitments 

To ensure we have a robust sustainability program in place, we will 

also publish the key initiatives we plan to implement within the next 

year.

3.2 Environmental sustainability 

Overview 

Tracking of the energy consumptions of our businesses 

forms the basis of our sustainability efforts. We measure 

the carbon footprint of our operations, providing insight 

into the carbon reduction and energy efficiency 

opportunities at each division. 

Managing our carbon footprint 

We are committed to positive action on climate change and dedicated 

to reducing the carbon emission in our daily operations. Employees 

are reminded to save electricity and fuel consumption through regular 

internal communications.  

To determine the carbon footprint, we collect energy usage data from 

each our businesses and then calculate our total annual greenhouse 

gas emissions.  

In FY2017, Spackman Entertainment generated a carbon footprint of 

184.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide emission (tCO2e), representing a 

carbon emission intensity of 9.0 tCO2e per million dollars of revenue. 

The emission mainly arises from purchased electricity used in our 

offices which accounted for approximately 63% of the total carbon 

emission of Spackman Entertainment. 

 

 

 

9tCO2e 

Carbon emission intensity per 

million dollars of revenue 




Sustainability Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 

Spackman Entertainment Group Ltd | 10 

 

 

 

 

 

We follow the Greenhouse Gas Protocol established by the World 

Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable 

Development, the standard manual for measuring corporate 

greenhouse gas emissions. Using the “control method”, we include 

100% of the emissions associated with businesses which we directly 

control. Our carbon footprint includes:  

• 

All fuels used directly by our companies (Scope 1 emissions) 

• 

All purchased electricity used in our offices (Scope 2 

emissions) 

• 

Impact of business air travel (optional Scope 3 emissions) 

We will continue to monitor the performance on the carbon emission 

reduction. Progress and performance on the reduction of carbon 

emission will be reported in the following year. 

Saving electricity 

The Group’s electricity consumption came from regular operations of 

the office. In FY2017, the total electricity consumption of the Group is 

394 megawatt-hours (MWh), representing an electricity consumption 

intensity of 19 MWh per million dollars of revenue. 

All employees stringently complied with the Group’s policy of saving 

energy. The Group utilised electricity-saving light bulbs at its offices 

as well as educated its employees about energy conservation and 

emission reductions. To ensure the effective use of electricity, the 

Group adopted the following practices:   

• 

Turn off lights, computers and air conditioning system before 

clocking out 

• 

Place energy saving reminder labels next to switches 

• 

Clean office equipment (such as refrigerator, air-conditioner) 

regularly to maintain high efficiency 

• 

Use energy saving equipment  

• 

Set temperature of air conditioners to 25˚C 

The Group established policies and procedures to reduce energy 

consumption in the office, to assess the energy efficiency, to increase 

the use of clean energy, if possible, to set applicable targets to 

monitor energy consumption, and to ensure power is turned off when 

electrical appliances are not in use.

3.3 Supporting local 

Overview 

Supporting local talent is the way to go in developing the 

local film industry. Collaborating with local authorities 

provides a host of economic benefits such as tourism 

promotion and job creation. 

Supporting the local industry 

Zip Cinema has been a member of the Korean Film Producers 

Association (KFPA) under the Korean Film Council (KOFIC) since 

2007. Novus Mediacorp and Frame Pictures also strongly support the 

industry initiatives of KFPA and KOFIC, to stimulate, grow and 

sustain the Korean film industry.  

We also seek to create long-term economic benefits for our 

communities through recruitment of local talent and development of 

local suppliers, supporting a reliable local supply network to drive 

economic growth. In FY2017, 94.1% of our talent were recruited 

locally and 79.5% of our purchases were sourced locally as well. 

In addition, all of our suppliers and contractors must adhere to our 

requirements regarding safety, health, security and the environment, 

as well as the principles of our Standards of Business Conduct. We 

are also focused on developing local businesses through regular 

meetings with them to ensure they are aware of the opportunities 

created by our projects and understand our requirements. 

KOFIC Location Incentives 

KOFIC is a government-supported, self-administered body, which 

strives to promote and support Korean films both in Korea and abroad 

to promote and support the production of Korean films through 

funding, research, education and training.  

KOFIC partners with the Korean Tourism Organisation (KTO) to 

combine Hallyu – the ‘Korean wave’ and the tourism industry through 

Hallyu marketing to boost the Korean tourism industry and share 

Korea’s culture with the world.  

As part of this initiative, KOFIC provides a Location Incentive Grant to 

support part of the expenses spent in Korea for producing foreign 

audio-visual works, for the purpose of tourism promotion, job creation 

and other economic benefits. 

It is also aimed at encouraging the hosting of location shooting and 

post-production of foreign audio-visual works and thereby enhancing 

the production capacities of the Korean film industry and creating an 

international production network around it.  

Eligible works consist of feature films, television series and 

documentaries produced by a foreign production company, in which 

the allocation of foreign capital in the production cost exceeds 80%. 

Up to 20-25% of the total Qualifying Production Expenditure (QPE) is 

claimable as Location Incentives Grant, depending on the available 

amount in the production’s total budget.  

Presently, the Group has not tapped either directly or indirectly on 

such incentives but may look at opportunities to collaborate with 

foreign partners to promote the Korea as a film and drama hub and 

the sharing of Hallyu to international audiences.

3.4 Connecting audiences 

Overview 

Korean movies claimed a domestic market share of 

51.8% (representing a box office of 113.9 million 

admissions) in 2017. Given this potential, the Korean 

movie industry certainly has the opportunity to effect 

positive change in the society on a large scale.  

Through effective storytelling, our movies helps to 

empower and inspire audiences to take action to improve 

their own lives and communities  

Box office performance – 

MASTER and GOLDEN SLUMBER 

Amidst an atmosphere of political uncertainty in Korea, it is not 

surprising to note that many of the most visible Korean movies in 

2017 were ones with political and crime themes, including Spackman 

Entertainment’s year end blockbuster MASTER and GOLDEN 

SLUMBER. 

According to KOFIC, MASTER ranked 37th on the list of the highest 

grossing films in South Korea of all time. The film is crime action 

movie about an intellectual crime investigation team and a notorious 

fraud surrounding a grand scam. 

GOLDEN SLUMBER is a manhunt thriller based on the Japanese 

novel by Isaka Kotaro. The film is about a mail courier who is falsely 

accused of assassinating a presidential candidate and how his past 

friendships intertwined along the way to save him.   

Through these two of our recent major movies, we believe that both 

local and international audiences would be able to relate to the 

underlying political and crime themes that are closely linked to the 

economic and social issues relevant to both developed and 

developing cities, and stimulate their thoughts on these global topics. 

Future goals 

We recognise that our businesses represent a wide variety of voices, 

cultures, lifestyles, and perspectives; we do not speak with one single 

voice about sustainability but rather approach each audience with a 

unique and appropriate message.  

Going forward, we will continue to find new opportunities to use these 

platforms to address various sustainability concerns.

3.5 Regulatory compliance 

Overview 

To maintain a fair, ethical and efficient business and 

working environment, the Group strictly adheres to the 

local laws and regulations relating to intellectual property 

(IP), child actors, anti-corruption and bribery, irrespective 

of the area or country where the Group conducts its 

business.  

Intellectual property 

IP rights shape each stage of a film-maker’s journey from script to 

screen. They help producers attract much needed funds; enable 

directors, screenwriters and actors, as well as the numerous artists 

and technicians who work behind the scenes, to earn a living; and 

inspire technological breakthroughs that enable creative ideas to be 

brought to life.  

The Group respects the creative effort behind all IPs driving the 

movie industry and ensures that all of its movies acknowledges and 

respects and appropriately remunerates the IP rights of all authors. 

Child actors 

The Group aims to uphold industry standards to ensure conditions for 

the development and protection of children and young people under 

the age of 18 involved in artistic performance (e.g., level of guardian 

supervision required when working for the Group, continuation of 

education according to local legal conditions, limits to number of 

hours worked, psychological support in dealing with child celebrity). 

Legal compliance 

The Group, through its Company Secretary, has updated the Board 

on relevant new laws and regulations affecting the Company, 

including changes to the SGX-ST Listing Rules, risk management, 

corporate governance, insider trading and key changes in the 

relevant regulatory requirements, to facilitate effective discharge of 

their fiduciary duties as Board or Board Committees members.  

Preventing corruption and bribery 

The Group prohibits all forms of corruption and bribery. The Group 

requires all employees to strictly abide by professional ethics and 

eliminate any corruption and bribery. All employees are expected to 

discharge their duties with integrity, to act fairly and professionally, 

and to abstain from engaging in bribery activities or any activities, 

which might exploit their positions against the Group’s interests. 

Whistle-blowers can report verbally or in writing to the senior 

management of the Group for any suspected misconduct (including 

corruption, bribery extortion, fraud and money laundering) with full 

details and supporting evidence. The management will conduct 

investigations against any suspicious or illegal behavior to protect the 

Group’s interests and the whistleblowers’ confidentiality. 

In FY2017, the Group was not in violation of any of the relevant laws 

and regulations in relation to IP, child actors, anti-corruption and 

bribery, extortion, fraud and money laundering that have a significant 

impact on the Group.
