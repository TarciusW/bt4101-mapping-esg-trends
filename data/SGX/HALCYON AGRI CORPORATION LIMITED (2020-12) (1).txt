Book 2:  Corporate Governance and Financial Reports


Halcyon Agri Corporation Limited (the “Company” or “HAC” and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) aspires to the highest standard 

of corporate governance practices, and continues to integrate sustainability development into the Group’s business approach as the Group 

believes that these are the pillars that support long-term value creation. The global COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world in different ways.

This report describes the Group’s ongoing efforts to enforce best practices in corporate governance in all aspects of the Group’s operations, as 

well as the practices implemented throughout the financial year ended 31 December 2020 (“FY2020”). The Board is pleased to report that the 

Group has adhered to all material principles and provisions of the Code of Corporate Governance 2018 (the “Code”), and wherever applicable, 

the disclosure guide developed by the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) in January 2015, together with other applicable 

laws, rules and regulations, including the Listing Manual (the “Listing Manual”) of the SGX-ST.

The disclosure of our corporate governance framework and practices in this report has been approved by the Board. To provide shareholders

BOARD MATTERS

The Board’s Conduct of Affairs

The Company is committed to conduct its business with integrity, fairness and transparency and will not tolerate any acts, attempted acts, or 

assistance with any form of bribery or corruption whether direct or indirect. The Board embraces value creation, innovation, sustainability and 

ethical business practices, and has embedded them in setting the strategic directions of the Company. It upholds high standards of corporate 

governance, puts in place a code of conduct and ethics, sets appropriate tone-from-the-top and desired organisational culture, and ensures 

proper accountability within the Company.

Although COVID-19 crisis has fundamentally changed the way businesses operate, the Company has been able to adapt and adjust to the 

changing environment, and deliver business outcome while conforming to the prevailing lockdown and other health and safety measures.

The Board has considered that the Company’s business model and fundamentals remain resilient to disruption.

Duties of the Board. The principal functions of the Board are to:

(a) 

establish corporate values and ethical standards of conduct for the Group;

(b) 

oversee the business performance and affairs of the Group and provide entrepreneurial leadership;

(c) 

set strategic direction for the Group, maintain the policy and decision-making framework in which the strategy is implemented;

(d) 

establish and maintain a sound risk management framework and adequate internal controls, setting risk appetite to achieve an 

appropriate balance between risk and the Group’s performance;

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

Book 2:  Corporate Governance and Financial Reports


(e) 

supervise, monitor and review the function and performance of the Group’s management and ensure that necessary resources are in 

place for the Company to meet its strategic objectives;

(f) 

review and approve annual budgets, financial plans, major acquisitions and divestment plans, funding and investment proposals;

(g) 

ensure transparency and accountability to key stakeholder groups including compliance with relevant laws and regulations as well as 

the financial reporting standards;

(h) 

ascertain and ensure the environmental, social and governance factors that are most material to the Company’s long-term goal and 

viability are integrated into overall company strategy;

(i) 

review and approve the appointment of Directors and KMP; and

(j) 

instil an ethical corporate culture and promote sustainable development.

Delegation of Authority. The Board capitalises on the expertise of the Independent Directors and benefits from delegating certain functions 

and authority of the Board to the four (4) board committees, namely, the AC, NC, RC and StratCom (collectively, the “Board Committees”). Each 

Board Committee functions within clearly defined terms of reference (“TOR”) which have been approved by the Board. The TOR, committee 

structure and membership of each committee are reviewed by the Board from time to time.

Except for the chairman of StratCom who is not an independent director, all other Board Committees are led by an Independent Director, to 

encourage independent oversight and enable the Board to discharge its obligations more effectively. Detailed functions and involvement of 

the Board Committees are described on pages 79 to 85 of this annual report.

The Board embraces the principle of empowerment, and believes that governance and management are more effective and efficient when 

they are separated. The day-to-day management, operation and administration of the Group are led by the CEO and the senior management 

of the Group (collectively, the “Management”), whose are accountable to the Board for their performance in pursuing the long-term success 

of the Group. The Management collaborates closely with the non-executive Directors and provide insights on the Group’s operations.

While the Board Committees and Management are tasked with certain responsibilities, all major decision-making remains the ultimate 

responsibility of the Board as a whole. A written Policy on Board Delegation of Authority (the “Delegation Policy”) which set out the framework 

and mechanisms by which the Board delegates specific standing powers and limits of authority to specified positions, has been adopted. The 

Delegation Policy aims to balance the need to empower and devolve decision-making to appropriate levels for operational efficiency and to 

ensure proper systems of control are in place. It provides clear directions to Management on matters that are reserved for the Board’s decision 

and approval, which include the followings:

(a) 

overall Group business and budget strategies;

(b) 

capital expenditures, investments or divestments exceeding certain material thresholds;

(c) 

all capital-related matters including capital issuance and redemption;

(d) 

significant policies governing the operations of the Company;

(e) 

corporate strategic development and restructuring;

(f) 

material interested person transactions which fall within the meaning of the Listing Manual; and

(g) 

risk management strategies.

All material transactions are reserved for the Board’s decision as a whole, without any individual or group of individuals exercising any 

considerable concentration of power or influence, or being allowed to dominate the Board’s decision making.

In times of heightened uncertainty, it is vital that the Management with a global vision of Group’s operation has the capacity and authority to 

make timely and agile decisions. Delegation of crisis response to the Management has facilitated the Company’s ability to quickly adopt the 

measures required or restrictions relating to COVID-19 pandemic which are imposed by the governing bodies in the countries where it operates.

Conflict of Interest. Directors have a duty to act in the best interests of the Company and are required to take all reasonable steps to avoid 

situations in which their own personal or business interests directly or indirectly conflict, or appear to conflict, with the interests of the Company. 

The Policy on Director’s Conflicts of Interest complements the Company’s corporate governance practices, and serves to guide the Directors 

in recognising and handling conflict situations. This policy requires any member of the Board or Board Committees who has an interest in 

a matter being deliberated upon by the Directors to recuse himself from discussions and abstain from participating in the approval process 

involving the issue of conflict. The Directors are also obliged to comply with disclosures obligations to avoid any possible conflicts of interest.

Board Meetings. The Board meets on a quarterly basis and as warranted by particular circumstances. Eight (8) meetings were scheduled and 

held in FY2020 to review, discuss and receive updates from Management on the Group’s financial performance, annual budget, corporate 

strategy, business plans, potential corporate actions, capital plans, risk management policies, appointment and re-appointment of Directors, 

executive remuneration, significant operational matters and development of corporate actions that took place during the year.

The Board believes that meetings between Directors who do not hold executive positions in the Group encourage and promote greater openness 

and facilitate provision of well-balanced viewpoints to the Board. Lead Independent Director may summon a meeting without the presence 

of the Management whenever deemed appropriate. Any recommendations or suggestions arising from such meeting will be communicated 

to the Board or to the Management as appropriate.

The Chairman oversees the setting of Board meeting agendas, and the Directors are encouraged to propose any topic that is deemed appropriate 

to be discussed. Draft meeting agendas are circulated to the chairmen of the Board and Board Committees in advance for comments, to make 

sure that all material topics are attended to.

Book 2:  Corporate Governance and Financial Reports

To ensure meetings are held with maximum Director participation, all Board meetings are planned and scheduled in advance after consultation 

with Directors. In addition, Directors who are not able to be physically present in the Board meetings may participate in the Board and Board 

Committee meetings by telephone or video conference, as permitted under the Company’s Constitution (the “Constitution”). The Constitution 

also provides that the Board may make decisions and grant approval by way of written resolutions. A list of written resolutions approved by 

the Board and Board Committees is compiled and circulated during Board and Board Committee meetings.

Social distancing measures and travel restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus have made virtual Board meeting a necessity, and all the 

Company’s Board and Board Committee meetings held after February 2020 were conducted remotely via electronic means. As the Board has 

employed board portal technologies since 2014, it is technologically equipped to have virtual meetings. All materials for Board and Board 

Committee meetings prior to COVID-19 pandemic have been disseminated through the encrypted, secure board portal. The switch from the 

regular physical meetings to virtual ones does not affect the effectiveness of the Board process and all meeting materials continued to be 

readily accessible in a timely manner on Directors’ tablet devices, laptops or desktop computers. The board portal enhances effectiveness in 

the boardroom and is especially important to facilitate information flow to and amongst Board members during this pandemic.

The record of Directors’ attendance at the Board and Board Committee meetings for FY2020 is set out on pages 73 to 76 of this annual report.

Board Access to Information. The Board has unrestricted access to the Company’s records and information. Directors are furnished with 

complete, adequate and timely information, and they are promptly alerted of changes to the Group’s business and financial condition, to assist 

the Board to make a balanced and informed assessment to decide on matters as and when they arise. Management has been maintaining close 

coordination and open dialogue with the Board on both the business risks and the workplace health and safety issues posed by COVID-19, to 

ensure the Directors are fully cognisant of the decisions and actions of the Management.

Documents and adequate information relating to meeting agenda items, including background and explanatory notes, financial statements, 

budgets, forecasts and progress reports of the Group’s business operations and internal audit reports are circulated at least one week prior to 

each Board and/or Board Committee meeting through the board portal, to allow sufficient time for Directors to comprehensively understand 

the issues to be deliberated upon and make informed decisions thereon. Senior management personnel who can provide additional insights 

into the matters at hand, if required, will be invited to attend the meetings to address queries from the Directors.

Analysis report covering the Group’s operational performance, financial results, market environment, treasury activities, corporate and business 

development as well as other relevant information is presented to the Board on a monthly basis. Such regular updates and timely reports allow 

the Board to monitor the Group’s performance as well as Management’s performance relating to the goals and objectives set by the Board. 

All information requested by the Director is provided in a timely manner.

Directors have direct and independent access to Management and may, at any time, request for further explanation, briefings or informal 

discussions on any aspect regarding the Group that is required for the discharge of Directors’ duties and responsibilities. The Directors also 

have separate and independent access to the Company Secretary at all times. The Company Secretary advises the Board on corporate and 

administrative matters, facilitates Director’s orientation and professional development, and ensures timely and good information flow within 

the Board and Board Committees, and between Management and the Independent Directors. The Company Secretary or her colleague attends 

all Board and Board Committees meetings to ensure that Board procedures are followed and that the applicable rules and regulations are 

complied with. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary are subject to the approval of the Board as a whole.

Where necessary, a Director may also seek independent legal and other professional advice concerning any aspect of the Group’s operations 

or undertakings at the Company’s expense.

Board Composition and Guidance

The Company’s Board is effective, comprises professionals with a broad range of experience and industry expertise, who discharge their duties 

and responsibilities at all times as fiduciaries in the interests of the Company. Taking into account the scope and nature of the Group’s operations 

as well as its strategic direction, and having regard to the Diversity Policy (as defined below), the Company and the Board are satisfied that 

the Board and Board Committees are of the right size for effective decision-making, has the appropriate balance and mix of skills, expertise, 

knowledge, experience and collectively possesses the necessary core competencies in diverse areas including accounting, finance, political 

or geopolitical savvy, business and management, strategic planning and global business experience, for the Board to effectively discharge its 

duties. The collective skillset and global business experience of the Board enable the Company to sustain and thrive in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Board Composition. The Company’s Board size has reduced from 10 members to eight (8) members in FY2020 and all disclosures relating to the 

appointment and departure of Directors in FY2020 have been announced to the public through SGXNet, in a timely manner. The Board presently 

consists a non-executive non-independent Chairman, one (1) executive director, four (4) independent directors and two (2) non-executive 

non-independent directors. There is a strong and independent element on the Board, with the Independent Directors constructively challenge 

and assist in developing proposals on strategies. The Board continued to function effectively during the year and was able to exercise objective 

judgement on corporate affairs independently.

The Board has considered the recommendation of the Code which stipulates that the independent directors to make up a majority of the 

Board where the Chairman is not an independent director. With reference to the common board size of six (6) directors for Singapore-listed 

companies1 and having considered the scope and nature of the Group’s operations, the Board concluded that it is well-constituted as the 

current board composition (board size of eight (8) members with 50% of independent directors and 88% of non-executive directors) has a high 

level of independence and with the right structure to enable the Board to function at optimum levels. Notwithstanding, the Board continues 

to review the attributes and skills that will enhance heterogeneity in the boardroom.

Board Diversity. The Company views diversity at the Board level as an essential element to build an open, inclusive and collaborative boardroom 

culture to support its strategic objectives and sustainable development. The Company’s Policy on Board Diversity (the “Diversity Policy”) 

endorses the principle that diverse Board should include and make good use of differences between the Directors in terms of professional 

experience, skills, knowledge, length of service, industry discipline, cultural and educational background, gender, age, ethnicity and other 

relevant factors. Different social constructs and diversity in thoughts allow the Board to consider issues more holistically and creatively during 

periods of uncertainty, which is important given the various emerging trends and business disruptions that may come up from time to time, 

such as COVID-19. The Board promotes the inclusion of different perspectives and ideas, recognises the potential merits of gender diversity 

in the boardroom and welcomes female directors on board. Where the candidates for appointment as director are relatively equivalent in their 

levels of required skills and experience, the Board is committed to advancing female candidates, in order to achieve gender diversity and add 

a broader perspective on the Board.

The Singapore Directorship Report 2018 published by Singapore Institute of Directors indicates that the most common size continues to 

be six (6) directors.

Chairman, CEO and Lead Independent Director

There is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and the executive responsible for managing the Company’s 

business. The roles of Chairman and the post of CEO are held by separate persons, to ensure an appropriate checks and balances, increased 

accountability, and greater capacity of the Board for independent decision making where no one individual has unfettered powers of 

decision-making. The two (2) key roles have fundamentally disparate responsibilities and functions, but complement each other in the overall 

objective of creating value for Shareholders, and play vital roles in providing the Group with strong leadership and vision.

Chairman. As the Chairman of the Board, Mr Liu Hongsheng leads and ensures the effectiveness of all general meetings and Board meetings. He 

is responsible for promoting culture of openness and debate of the Board, steering productive and comprehensive discussions between members 

of the Board and Management on strategic, business and other issues pertinent to the Group, as well as ensuring effective communication 

with Shareholders and other stakeholders. The Chairman takes a leading role in the Company’s drive to achieve and maintain a high standard 

of corporate governance with the support of the Board, Management and Company Secretary.

CEO. Mr Li Xuetao was appointed as the Company’s CEO in June 2020. He possesses in-depth industry knowledge and has the foresight to 

support the formulation of the Group’s strategic direction. Assisted by the management team, the CEO make decisions in all matters affecting 

the operations, performance and strategy of the Group’s businesses, with the exception of those matters reserved for the Board or specifically 

delegated by the Board to the Board Committees. He oversees the day-to-day management, leads and implements all major initiatives of the 

Group.

Lead Independent Director. Mr Alan Nisbet has been the Lead Independent Director since 2013 and continues to avail himself to address 

Shareholders’ concerns and acts as a counter-balance in the decision-making process. Shareholders and other stakeholders may approach 

the Lead Independent Director through the online enquiry form under the Company’s website, where all messages will be transmitted to him 

directly. The Lead Independent Director also plays an additional facilitative role within the Board and provides a channel to non-executive 

directors for confidential discussion on any concerns and to resolve conflicts of interest as and when necessary. He provides leadership in 

situation where the Chairman is conflicted, convenes and chairs meetings without the involvement of the Management, which enhance the 

capacity of the Board for independent decision making.

The roles, duties and responsibilities of the Chairman, CEO, Lead Independent Director and Directors of different classes (executive, 

non-executive and independent director) are detailed under a Memorandum on Director’s Duties and Responsibilities which has been distributed 

to each Director upon his appointment, and accessible in the board portal.

Board Membership and Performance Evaluation

The Board has a formal and transparent process for the appointment and re-appointment of Directors. The search, nomination and evaluation 

process is delegated to the NC. The NC comprises four (4) members and is chaired by Mr Lam Chun Kai, an Independent Director. The Lead 

Independent Director, Mr Nisbet, is also a member of the NC. The NC makes and reviews recommendations to the Board on all nominations 

for appointments and re-appointments to the Board, the appointment of KMP, the training and development programmes for the Board, and 

is responsible for the annual evaluation of Board performance.

The NC functions within clearly written TOR approved by the Board and its principal activities are as follows:

Board Appointment. The Board regularly and continually reviews its structure, size and composition to identify the balance of skills, 

knowledge and experience required for the Board to discharge its responsibilities effectively. Where appropriate, or if circumstances suggest 

that additional skills or experience is required and that a replacement and/or new appointment is beneficial to the Board, the NC will propose 

a new appointment or review and evaluate the competencies of candidates proposed by the Management. The NC has a formal and written 

guide to conduct due diligence checks to assess the suitability of a candidate for appointment as a Director of the Company. To ensure the 

Company has the opportunity to benefit from all available talent, the evaluation of potential new director is made based on meritocracy, and 

candidates will be considered against objective criteria, having due regard for the benefits of diversity on the Board, the ability of prospective 

candidates to contribute to discussions, deliberations and activities of the Board as well as the balance of independent directors on the Board.

In its review of proposal for appointment or re-appointment of each Director as well as KMP, NC will also take into consideration the 

composition and progressive renewal of the Board, as well as each Director’s competencies, principal commitment, contribution and 

performance (including attendance to the meeting, preparedness, participation and candour), including, if applicable, his or her performance 

as an independent director. Such appointment or re-appointment which has been recommended by the NC will be deliberated by the Board 

as a whole, and the appointment are reserved for the Board’s decision. The Constitution also spells out the procedures for the appointment 

of new Directors, along with the re-election and removal of Directors.

The NC is also tasked to recommend and review succession plans for the Company’s Directors and senior management, in particular for the 

Chairman, the CEO and the KMP, taking into account the challenges and opportunities facing the Group and the skills and experience needed 

in the future. The Company integrates executive development programs into CEO and KMP succession planning, and builds talent internally 

through training, so that the best internal candidates are identified early and flagged at the Board level. Where necessary or appropriate, the 

NC may tap on its networks and/or engage external professional headhunters to assist with identifying and shortlisting candidates. The NC can 

also approach relevant institutions such as the Singapore Institute of Directors, professional organisations or business federations to source 

for suitable candidates.

Review of Board Independence. The NC reviews and determines whether a Director is independent on an annual basis, and as and when 

circumstances require. Each of the Independent Directors has submitted a declaration form confirming that he is to be considered independent 

under the requirements of Rule 210(5)(d) of the Listing Manual as well as the provisions set out in the Code. Taking into consideration the 

declarations submitted by the Independent Directors, as well as the length that the Director has served on the Board, the NC has determined 

that each of the Independent Directors is independent in conduct, character and judgement, and has no relationship with the Company, its 

related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers, and there has been no element that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived 

to interfere, with the exercise of the Director’s independent business judgement in the best interests of the Group. It was also noted that 

none of the Independent Directors have served for a continuous period of nine (9) years or more, and none of them or their family members 

was employed by, or received significant payment from or provided material services to the Group in FY2020 or in any of the past three (3) 

financial years.

Book 2:  Corporate Governance and Financial Reports

Board Orientation, Training and Development. The NC oversees and makes recommendations to the Board for training and professional 

development programs available to Directors, as well as induction for newly appointed Directors. The Board has adopted a set of best practice 

for Director’s training and development which is documented under a Policy on Induction, Training and Development for Directors (the 

“Training Policy”).

The Training Policy serves (i) to assist the new Director who is appointed to the Board for the first time to gain an understanding of his or 

her roles, duties, obligations and responsibilities as a Director of the Company, as well as the framework within which the Group operates; 

and (ii) to encourage all Directors to regularly review his or her training and professional development needs, to ensure the Directors have 

appropriate competencies to effectively fulfill their responsibilities to the Company and its Shareholders as well as stakeholders. A formal letter 

of appointment setting out the roles of a Director and the time commitment required, as well as information about the Group, its operations, 

business, practices and governance systems, is also issued to each newly appointed Director to ensure that the Director is aware of his or her 

duties and obligations.

The induction programme is tailored for each new Director (depending on his or her requirements, skills, qualifications and experience) and will, 

as a mandatory requirement, request the new Director who has no prior experience as a director of a listed company to attend pre-requisite 

course for first-time appointee on boards of listed company, to familiarise himself or herself with the roles and responsibilities of a director of 

a public listed company. Mr Eddie Chan Yean Hoe, the new director appointed in FY2020, has completed the core Listed Entity Director (LED) 

Programme of the Singapore Institute of Directors organised with the support of the SGX-ST, within three (3) months of his appointment as 

a Director of the Company.

To ensure each Director fulfils the needed and desired competencies of the Board, and keep abreast of changes to the regulatory environment, 

Directors are encouraged to attend courses which are relevant to the Directors in discharging their roles and responsibilities, at the Company’s 

expense. The list of available seminars and courses is circulated to Directors through the board portal. Reading materials in connection with 

professional developments and applicable regulatory updates or amendments to relevant laws, rules and regulations are also disseminated to 

Directors through the board portal. Comprehensive and useful information covering the duties and obligations of a Director, TOR of Board 

Committees, Group’s business activities, strategic directions, policies and key areas of operations of the Group, are also provided in the 

resource centre under the board portal, and is accessible to all Directors. All Directors would be offered the opportunity to visit the Group’s 

major operational sites and meet with any of the senior executives of the Group.

The Management regularly update the Board and provide insights on business and strategic developments at meetings. The Group’s external 

auditors, Ernst &amp; Young LLP (“EY”), regularly brief the AC members on changes to and new developments of accounting and reporting standards 

and/or regulatory environment.

Commitment to the Board. Directors of the Company are required to notify the Board of any new appointment of directorships to listed 

companies or other principal commitments, for the Board or NC to consider and to evaluate whether such Director is able to commit the time 

to adequately carried out his duties as a Director of the Company.

To ensure that each Director is able to devote sufficient time and attention to carrying out his role in accordance with his duties, the Board has 

determined that the maximum number of listed company board representations each Director of the Company is allowed to hold is as follows:

(a) 

directorships without other executive roles – Six (6)

(b) 

directorships with other executive roles – Four (4)

Rotation and Re-election of Directors. At each annual general meeting (“AGM”), Directors constitutes not less than one-third of the Board are 

required to retire from office by rotation, and a Director shall submit himself for re-nomination and re-election at regular intervals of at least 

once every three (3) years. These requirements are clearly stated in the Company’s Constitution and each member of the Board has submitted 

himself for re-nomination and re-appointment at least once, during the past three (3) years.

Directors appointed after the Company’s AGM held in 2020 (“2020 AGM”) to fill the casual vacancies, being Mr Li Xuetao and Mr Eddie Chan, 

shall hold office only until the forthcoming AGM. Pursuant to the Constitution, they are eligible and will submit themselves for re-election, 

but shall not be taken into account in determining the Directors who are to retire by rotation at the forthcoming AGM. Mr Alan Nisbet, Mr 

Liew Choon Wei and Mr Lam Chun Kai, being Directors who have been longest in office since their last election, have submitted themselves 

for re-nomination and re-election.

Pursuant to Rule 210(5)(d)(iii) of the Listing Manual which will take effect from 1 January 2022, Mr Nisbet, having served on the Board since 7 

January 2013, will not be considered as an Independent Director from 7 January 2022. For Mr Nisbet to continue in office as an Independent 

Director, the resolution to consider his re-appointment would be submitted for two (2) tiers voting process, i.e. by (i) all Shareholders and (ii) 

all Shareholders, excluding the Directors, the CEO and their associates, in the forthcoming AGM.

Each of the Directors who is subject to re-election at the forthcoming AGM has abstained himself from making any recommendation and/or 

participating in any deliberation in respect of the assessment of his own re-election as the Directors. At the recommendation of the NC and 

with the approval of the Board, resolutions for the re-appointment of Mr Li, Mr Eddie Chan, Mr Nisbet, Mr Liew and Mr Lam as Directors of 

the Company will be tabled at the forthcoming AGM for Shareholders’ approval. They will, upon re-appointment as Directors, hold the same 

office in the Board and Board Committees immediately held before their re-appointment.

For information required under Rule 720(6) and Appendix 7.4.1 of the Listing Manual in respect of the Directors seeking re-election at the AGM, 

please refer to pages 91 to 100 of this annual report.

Board Performance Evaluation. The NC decides how the Board’s performance may be evaluated and take charge of the annual assessment of 

the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and of each Board Committee, as well as the contribution of the Chairman and each Director to the 

effectiveness of the Board. The performance of the Board and each of the Board Committees is assessed by the NC on its overall effectiveness 

in accomplishing its goals and discharging its responsibilities based upon the following criteria:

(a) 

Board size and composition;

(b) 

Board governance processes;

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

80

Halcyon Agri    Corporate Report 2020

Book 2:  Corporate Governance and Financial Reports


(c) 

Board information and accountability;

(d) 

Board’s performance in relation to discharging its principal functions;

(e) 

where practical, financial references which include return on capital employed, return on equity, debt to equity ratio, dividend payout 

ratio, economic value added, earnings per share, and total shareholder return (i.e. dividend plus share price increase over the year); 

and

(f) 

Board Committee performance, qualification and effectiveness in relation to discharging their responsibilities set out in their respective 

TOR.

The evaluation of Chairman aims to assess his leadership, commitment as well as his relationship with Board members, whereas the individual 

directors are evaluated based on his dedication and understanding of role, preparedness and participation in the meetings, as well as quality 

of inputs to matters deliberated by the Board.

A formal evaluation questionnaire was tabulated and circulated to all Directors via the board portal, for Directors to rate and provide feedback 

on the performance of the Board, the Board Committees, the Chairman and each Director for FY2020. The assessment provides insights into 

the functioning of the Board, whilst identifying areas that might need strengthening and development. Directors are invited to provide their 

views and suggestions for any specific areas where improvements may be made to improve Board effectiveness. Every Director is also requested 

to complete an assessment of each Director’s contributions, including himself, to the effectiveness of the Board, on anonymous basis.

The findings of the Board evaluation (including feedback and comments received from the Directors) are analysed and discussed by the NC, in 

consultation with the Chairman of the Board to identify areas for improvement and any training required to further enhance the effectiveness 

of the Board. The Board will then review feedback from the NC collectively and will decide and agree on action plans.

Following the review for FY2020, the NC and the Board are satisfied that the Chairman as well as each Director has contributed to the overall 

effectiveness of the Board and demonstrates commitment to his roles on the Board, and that the Board and Board Committees operate 

effectively and have met their respective performance objectives. Notwithstanding that certain Directors have multiple board representations, 

these multiple directorships are not in conflict with the interests of the Company, and are within the maximum number of listed company board 

representations each Director of the Company is allowed to hold. No external facilitator was used in the evaluation process.

Strategy and Investment Committee

The StratCom consists of four (4) members and chaired by the Board’s Chairman, Mr Liu. StratCom’s governing processes, duties and 

responsibilities have been documented under written TOR approved by the Board. StratCom supports the Board in the following areas:

(a) 

defining and monitoring the Company’s strategic direction;

(b) 

reviewing and evaluating significant capital deployment and asset management; and

(c) 

working with the Management to oversee and review significant strategic decisions as well as major investment or divestment plans.

One (1) StratCom meeting was held in FY2020 to review the Group’s prospects and long-term development strategic planning.

REMUNERATION MATTERS

The Company’s remuneration policy seeks to ensure that the level and structure of remuneration are appropriate and proportionate to the 

sustained performance and value creation of the Group, taking into account the strategic objectives of the Group. Reviewing and making 

recommendations to the Board on the framework of remuneration for the Board and KMP as well as the specific packages for each Director 

and the KMP, are the key functions of the RC.

Remuneration Committee

The RC is chaired by an Independent Director, Mr Liew, and comprises Mr Nisbet and Mr Liu. All members of the RC are non-executive directors 

and none of the RC members is allowed to participate in the deliberation, and has to abstain from voting on any resolution, relating to his own 

remuneration or that of employees related to him. 

The key responsibilities and authorities of the RC are as follows:

Developing Group Remuneration Policies. The RC ensures that the remuneration and incentive framework, policies and practices are 

appropriate to attract, retain and motivate Directors to provide good stewardship of the Company and KMP to successfully manage the Company 

for the long term. The RC considers all aspects of remuneration (including directors’ fees, salaries, allowances, bonuses, options, share-based 

incentives and awards, benefits in kind and severance packages) and aims to be fair and avoid rewarding poor performance. It also reviews the 

Company’s obligations arising in the event of termination of the CEO’s and KMP’s contracts of service, to ensure that such contracts contain 

fair and reasonable termination clauses which are not overly generous. It may from time to time, and where necessary or required, seek advice 

from external consultants in framing its remuneration policy and determining the level and mix of remuneration for Directors and KMP.

In respect of long-term incentive schemes (if any, including share schemes as may be implemented), the RC is responsible for considering 

whether Directors should be eligible for benefits under such long-term incentive schemes. Any recommendation of the RC will be submitted 

to the Board for consideration and approval. The Board is ultimately accountable for all remuneration decisions.

Where applicable, the RC will also review annually the remuneration of employees related to the Directors, the CEO and substantial shareholders 

to ensure that their remuneration packages are in line with the staff remuneration guidelines and commensurate with their respective job scopes 

and level of responsibilities. The RC will also review and approve any bonuses, pay increases and/or promotions for these employees, if any.

The Company currently does not impose contractual provisions to reclaim incentive components of remuneration paid in prior years in the 

service agreements or employment agreements of the KMP. Notwithstanding this, the Company is not precluded from exercising the right to 

reclaim such incentives in exceptional circumstances including for example, misstatement of financial results or of misconduct resulting in 

financial loss to the Group.

Agreeing the Level and Mix of Remuneration. The key considerations of the RC in recommending the level and mix of remuneration are:

(a) 

to link rewards with value creation and offer appropriate remuneration and employment conditions to build, motivate and retain 

Directors, KMP and talent;

(b) 

to align the interests of Directors and KMP with the interests of Shareholders and other stakeholders;

(c) 

risk policies of the Company, such that the remuneration is symmetric with risk outcome and sensitive to the time horizon of risk; and

(d) 

country-specific practices including the pay and employment conditions within the industry.

Remuneration framework as well as the specific remuneration packages which is tailored to the specific role and circumstances of each Director 

and KMP, including the CEO, are reviewed and discussed in the RC meeting. When it recommends the remuneration package to the Board, 

the RC takes into consideration the aforementioned factors, the strategic direction of the Group and industry practice, and benchmarks the 

remuneration package against relevant industry players to ensure an appropriate remuneration level and mix that recognises the performance, 

potential and responsibilities of these individuals.

Specific remuneration packages for each Director in respect of FY2020 have been approved by the Board and is explicitly disclosed on a named 

basis, on pages 73 to 76 of this annual report.

Remuneration of Non-executive Directors. The Directors’ Fees for each non-executive Director which comprise a basic fee and attendance 

fees, are appropriate to the level of contribution, taking into account factors such as effort, time spent, and responsibilities. Directors’ Fees 

are reviewed annually by the RC to benchmark such fees against the amounts paid by other listed companies of similar size. No changes are 

proposed to the Directors’ Fees structure for the financial year ending 31 December 2021 (“FY2021”), and it remains the same as FY2020. The 

Directors’ Fees structure is as follows:

of Directors’ fees of up to S$750,000 (payable quarterly in arrears) for FY2021.

Remuneration of Executive Director and KMP. Performance measures and remuneration packages of the executive Director and KMP emphasis

Halcyon Agri    Corporate Report 2020

Book 2:  Corporate Governance and Financial Reports


Summary of RC Observations for FY2020. The Group’s remuneration policies are appropriate, effective, meet the commercial requirements 

to remain competitive, are sensitive to the time horizon of risk and allow flexibility in response to prevailing circumstances, and align with the 

long-term interest of the Group. Currently, there are no employee share schemes provided by the Company or the Group, and the Company 

does not have any long-term incentive plans. None of the Directors and KMP received any termination, retirement and post-employment 

benefits. All Directors and the KMP are remunerated on an earned basis. There is no employee in the Group who is a substantial shareholder 

of the Company or immediate family member of a Director or the CEO or substantial shareholders.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new and unique challenges to the global economy and the Group’s business in the first-half of 2020 

was not spared from the sudden downturn. The performance targets and financial metrics for FY2020 have been adversely affected by the 

on-going pandemic, and KPI planned and set for the KMP at the beginning of the year are inevitably not achievable. As the COVID-19 situation 

was evolving rapidly, KPI for FY2020 were not adjusted as changes may not be reflective of the business environment which was highly volatile 

throughout FY2020.

The Board recognises that despite the FY2020 KPI were not met, the Management devoted extra efforts and energy to fulfilling their 

commitments under the demanding circumstances during the challenging year, and its responses to overcome the unprecedented crisis are 

commendable.

The Board is of the view that the Company’s remuneration decision for FY2020 aligns with the long-term interests of Shareholders and 

other stakeholders, as well as the risk management policy of the Company. The Company did not engage any remuneration consultants or 

professional firms in FY2020.

ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT

The Board is accountable and answerable to the Shareholders for all aspects of the Company. It endeavours to ensure that Shareholders are 

furnished with timely information, full disclosure of material information and aims to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the 

Company’s performance, position and prospects to the Shareholders. It is imperative that the Shareholders are kept informed of the impact of 

COVID-19 on the Group’s operation and performance. The Board is responsible for the governance of risks and ensuring that effective system 

of risk management and internal controls is in place. Its function relating to overseeing both internal and external audits is delegated to the AC.

Risk Management and Internal Controls

The Board as a whole is responsible for the governance of risk and the overall internal controls framework. It determines the nature and extent 

of the significant risks which is appropriate for the Company in achieving its strategic objection and creating value for the Shareholders. The 

Board provides oversight in the design, implementation and monitoring of the risk management framework and policies, as well as the system 

of internal controls. It has significantly heightened vigilance on the effectiveness of internal controls and placed close scrutiny on high-risk 

areas in the wake of COVID-19 crisis.

The Board also ensures that Management puts in place action plans to mitigate the risks identified, and undertake remedial actions to rectify 

any control lapses. It devotes significant attention to maintaining an effective system of risk management and internal controls, to safeguard 

the investment of the Company and its Shareholders, and ensure that risks are managed in the best interests of the Group. The principal risks 

facing the Company are described under the Risk Management section on pages 28 to 29 of this annual report.

In assessing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls, the Board focuses on identifying control gaps in the business process, areas 

for improvement and areas where controls can be strengthened. This process assists in ensuring that primary key objectives are met, material 

assets are properly safeguarded, fraud or errors in the accounting records are prevented or detected, accounting records are accurate and 

complete, and reliable financial information is prepared in compliance with applicable internal policies, laws and regulations. The Company’s 

internal audits supplement the Group’s evaluation on all matters concerning internal controls including the assessment of any issue identified 

in the course of internal audit as well as the administration and implementation of the Group’s internal policies and procedures.

The Company has a dedicated team which is responsible for developing, monitoring and maintaining risk management controls and reporting 

any key issues to Management. A risk management committee (“RMC”) formed by the Management which comprises the CEO, Managing 

Director – HRC Group, Chief Commercial Officer – Corrie MacColl Group and CFO, is responsible to assess and determine the nature and 

extent of the financial risks which the Company is allowed to take. The Group Risk Management Policy which imposed appropriate measures and 

limits to control commercial risk exposures be reviewed regularly to ensure it is symmetric with market environment and Group’s operations.

The internal controls practice of each of the Group’s functions is reviewed annually or when circumstances warrant the review process. The 

Management constantly review legal and regulatory developments regarding COVID-19 as well as the Company’s risk-mitigation policies and 

protocols, and adjust such protocols as necessary to conform to developing regulatory circumstances, especially if a particular regulatory 

scheme relates to activities that are core to the Group’s operations, to enhance the standard operating procedures and ensure the business is 

fully compliant with the applicable regulations and Group’s policies. The Board’s commentary on the Company’s risk management and internal 

controls is set out on page 85 of this annual report.

Audit Committee

The AC is chaired by the Lead Independent Director, Mr Nisbet, and comprise only non-executive Directors, namely, Mr Liew, Mr Qin, Mr Lam 

and Mr Eddie Chan. The members of the AC are professionals who have extensive experience in senior management positions, including two 

(2) retired audit partners from Big-four accounting firms with extensive accounting and financial management expertise. The AC members 

are therefore appropriately qualified to discharge their responsibilities. None of the AC members were previous partners or directors of the 

Company’s external audit firm within the last two (2) years and none of the AC members hold any financial interest in such external audit firm.

The main responsibility and objective of the AC is to assist the Board in fulfilling its financial and other oversight responsibilities by serving as 

an independent and objective party to oversee, monitor and appraise the integrity of the Company’s financial reporting process, the internal 

controls and risk management systems as well as the audits processes. Significant findings in the course of its reviews are reported to the Board.

questions which the AC may have. It also has direct access to the Company’s external auditors and is conferred the authority to source external 

resources including obtaining legal or other professional advice and services. It may commission an independent audit on internal controls 

and risk management for its assurance, or where it is not satisfied with the systems of internal controls and risk management.

The AC performed, among others, the following core duties and activities in FY2020:

Financial Reporting. The Company’s financial results are prepared and presented in compliance with statutory requirements including 

applicable accounting standards and Listing Manual. The AC safeguards the integrity in financial reporting and ensures such reporting is in 

compliance with the requirements of the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards. It reviews all announcements relating to the Company’s 

financial performance, and oversees significant financial reporting issues and assessments, in particular, reviews the Group’s application 

and consistency of financial and accounting policies, judgements and practices. The AC, when satisfied that the financial results and related 

announcements meet statutory requirements, would submit and recommend the release of the financial results and related announcements 

to the Board. Any significant issues and judgement that AC considered in relation to the financial statements and the actions to address such 

concerns will also be reported to the Board.

Following the amendments to Rule 705(2) of the Listing Manual effective from 7 February 2020, the Board has decided to announce its financial 

statements on a half-yearly basis, and provide voluntary interim business performance updates on financial and other operational metrics to 

the Shareholders periodically. The Company continues to comply with its continuing disclosure obligations to keep the Shareholders updated 

when appropriate, should there be any material developments (financial or otherwise) relating to the Company or the Group. Its half-yearly and 

full year financial results are provided to Shareholders and published on the SGX-ST within the timeline stipulated under the Listing Manual, 

after they are approved by the Board.

Given the extremely rapid and onset of the COVID-19 crisis, the Company’s liquidity and capital considerations have been monitored closely 

by the Management and the impact of the crisis on the Company’s cash flow, status of upcoming maturities of outstanding indebtedness as 

well as compliance with financial covenants are reported to the AC regularly.

External Audits. AC reviews the overall scope of external audits prior to each audit process, to ensure material areas are covered and sufficient 

attention is dedicated to emerging and existential risk. During the course of review of the Company’s financial statements for FY2020, the AC 

has reviewed and discussed each of the key audit matters (“KAMs”) with the Management as well as EY. The AC has assessed and considered 

the Management’s approach, methodology and assumptions applied to each of the KAMs, and was satisfied with the appropriateness of the 

analyses performed by the Management. The AC agrees and concurs with the basis and conclusions included in EY’s report with respect to 

the KAMs. For more information on the KAMs, please refer to page 103 of this annual report.

The scope and results of auditing by the Company’s external auditors, EY, its cost effectiveness, as well as its independence and objectivity 

are reviewed by the AC annually. The AC and the Board are satisfied that the aggregate amount of audit fees paid and/or payable to EY in 

connection with the audit as well as non-audit services for FY2020 is appropriate. Having considered the relevant provisions under the applicable 

regulations, the cooperation extended by the Management and the fact that the non-audit services were provided by a separate team from EY, 

AC is of the view that the independence or objectivity of EY is not impaired. For details of fees paid and/or payable to EY in respect of audit 

and non-audit services, please refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Financial Statements on page 129 of this annual report.

Taking into consideration all relevant factors (with reference to the audit quality indicators as published by the Accounting and Regulatory 

Authority) including the adequacy of resources, experience of supervisory and professional staff to be assigned to the audit process, the quality 

of work carried out by EY, the size and complexity of the Group, its businesses and operations, AC has recommended that EY be re-appointed 

as the Company’s external auditors for FY2021. The appointment of external auditors of the Group complies with Rules 712 and 715 of the 

Listing Manual.

Internal audits. The primary functions of the internal audit function are to:

(a) 

assess the relevant risks related to the Group’s business operations and evaluate if an adequate system of internal controls is in place 

to protect the funds and assets of the Group;

(b) 

assess if operations of the business processes under review are conducted efficiently and effectively and to ensure control procedures 

are complied with; and

(c) 

identify and recommend improvement to internal control procedures, where required.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

Halcyon Agri    Corporate Report 2020

Book 2:  Corporate Governance and Financial Reports


The Board believes that outsourcing the internal audit function to a professional firm is beneficial as the professional service provider has a 

broad range of expertise, resources, advanced degrees and technological specialisation to undertake the internal audit of the Group, especially 

for the Group’s business which has global presence.

AC decides on the appointment, termination and remuneration of Nexia TS Risk Advisory Pte Ltd (“Nexia”), the Group’s internal auditor since 

May 2013. To ensure that the review on internal controls is conducted effectively, Nexia’s primary reporting line is to the AC, and it is granted 

unfettered access to all the Company’s documents, records, properties and personnel.

Internal audits are performed accordingly to the audit plan and scope agreed between Nexia and the AC. Nexia reviews, then evaluates and 

tests the effectiveness of the internal controls on material business process including financial, operational, compliance and information 

technology controls that are in place in each of the Group’s key operating units. Notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic posed challenges 

to the internal audit priorities and led to a shift in audit approach to remote auditing, the internal audits for FY2020 had been able to complete 

according to its schedule.

Nexia presented the internal audit reports, which compile the detailed findings relevant to the Group’s key operating units which it had reviewed, 

to the AC during quarterly meetings. Any material non-compliance or failure in internal controls, recommendations for improvements and 

remedial actions taken by Management are reported to the AC. If action plans to mitigate the risks are required, the AC would instruct and 

ensure that Management undertakes follow-up actions.

The AC reviews the adequacy, effectiveness, independence and scope of the internal audit function annually, including the internal audit plans, 

activities, budget for internal audit and organisational structure of Nexia. It believes that the internal audit conducted by Nexia for FY2020 

attained professional standards, including those promulgated by The Institute of Internal Auditors. The AC is satisfied that the internal audit 

function has adequate resources given that there is a team of 11 members assigned to the Company’s internal audits, led by Ms Pamela Chen 

who has 14 years of relevant experience, and Nexia has appropriate standing within the Group during FY2020, and that the quantum of fee 

paid or payable to Nexia should not put its objectivity at risk.

The AC meets with the internal and external auditors without the presence of Management at least once a year, to obtain feedback on the 

competency and adequacy of the finance function and to ascertain if there are any material weaknesses or control deficiencies in the Group’s 

financial reporting and operational systems.

Governance of Risk. The AC is tasked to assist the Board to oversee Management in the design, implementation and monitoring of the internal 

controls and risk management systems. This includes identifying weaknesses, assessing risks of the new possesses relating to COVID-19 

measures, and recommending areas for improvement and additional risk mitigations, where necessary. The Management reviews the conditions 

of the industry and any factors or events that may affect the Group’s operations, and presented its observation of the potential risks to the AC 

during quarterly meetings. Any material changes to the key risks areas are also reported to the AC as soon as they are identified. AC has reviewed 

the up-to-date risk register, the implementation and execution of standard operating procedures, as well as remedial actions recommended 

by the internal auditor and implemented by Management. The AC reports annually to the Board, its view on the effectiveness and adequacy of 

the Group’s internal controls (including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls) and risk management systems.

Whistleblowing Framework. The Group has in place and has published on its website, the Whistleblowing Policy as well as a channel to raise 

concerns about any suspected improprieties. Its Whistleblowing Policy provides employees and third-parties a direct channel to the AC for the 

raising of concerns about any improprieties in matters of financial reporting, or other aspects in confidence and in good faith, without fear of 

reprisal. All whistleblowing matters come under the purview of the AC, to ensure independent investigation of such matters and for appropriate 

follow-up action. The Whistleblowing Policy and its effectiveness will be reviewed by the AC periodically, with any recommendations regarding 

updates or amendments being made to the Board as required.

Interested Person Transactions (“IPT”). The AC reviews IPTs (if any) at its quarterly meetings, to ensure that established procedures for 

monitoring the IPTs have been complied with. The AC is satisfied that the guidelines and review procedures established to review IPTs have been 

complied with in FY2020. Further information relating to the IPTs during FY2020 is provided under the section “Interested Person Transactions”.

Summary of the Board and AC’s Observations for FY2020. The Board is of the view that the AC comprises members with requisite qualifications 

and sufficient financial management expertise to discharge the AC’s functions competently. It has received assurances from the CEO and CFO 

that for FY2020:

(a) 

the Group’s financial records have been properly maintained and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group’s 

operations and finances; and

(b) 

the Group’s risk management and internal controls systems are adequate and effective in addressing the financial, operational, 

compliance and information technology risks of the Group.

With the assurances from the CEO together with the CFO, and following its assessment on the following:

(a) 

the reviews of the reports of Nexia;

(b) 

internal controls established and maintained by the Group;

(c) 

remedial actions taken by the Management according to internal auditor’s recommendations; and

(d) 

reports from EY,

the Board, with the concurrence of the AC, is of the opinion that the Group’s present risk management and internal controls systems are 

adequate and effective in addressing the financial, operational, compliance and information technology risks of the Group. However, the Board 

notes that the risk management and internal controls provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatements of loss, 

and include the safeguarding of assets, the maintenance of proper accounting records, the reliability of financial information, compliance with 

appropriate legislation, regulation and best practice, and the identification and containment of business risk. The Board also notes that all 

internal control systems contain inherent limitations and no system of internal controls can provide absolute assurance against the occurrence 

of material errors, poor judgement in decision-making, human error losses, fraud or other irregularities.

SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND ENGAGEMENT

The Company’s corporate governance practices promote fair and equitable treatment of all Shareholders. Shareholders, as the owners of 

the Company, are entitled to attend and vote at general meetings, to a share of the Company’s profits and all other rights pursuant to The 

Companies Act (Chapter 50) of Singapore (the “Companies Act”) as well as the provisions of the Company’s Constitution.

Shareholder Rights and Conduct of Shareholder Meetings

The Company’s general meetings provide an opportune forum for Shareholders to meet the Board and senior management and to interact 

with them. It is the Company’s principal forum for dialogue with Shareholders. In light of safe distancing measures amid COVID-19 outbreak, 

the 2020 AGM was held via electronic means in accordance with the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 and the COVID-19 (Temporary 

Measures) (Alternative Arrangements for Meetings for Companies, Variable Capital Companies, Business Trusts, Unit Trusts and Debenture 

Holders) Order 2020.

Shareholders were invited to attend the 2020 AGM via live audio-visual webcast. In order to understand the view of Shareholders, to gather 

inputs and address their concerns, Shareholders are encouraged to submit questions in advance of the general meeting. All substantial and 

relevant questions were addressed prior to the AGM through publication on the Singapore Exchange’s website and on the Company’s website.

General meetings are attended by all Directors whenever possible, and would normally be chaired by the Chairman of the Board. Chairmen 

of the Board Committees are also available at the meetings to answer any questions relating to the operations of the Board Committees. The 

Company’s external auditors are also present to address Shareholders’ queries about the conduct of audit and the preparation and content 

of the auditors’ report. Wherever practicable, updates on the Company’s performance and position are presented to the Shareholders in the 

general meetings, and such presentation materials are made available on the SGX-ST and the Company’s website prior to the meetings, for 

the benefit of the Shareholders.

The Company notifies the Shareholders on the meeting schedule and the agenda of meeting at least 14 or 21 days (as the case may be) prior 

to the date appointed for the general meeting. The notice of general meeting issued to all Shareholders is advertised in newspapers (where 

applicable) and disseminated through SGXNet, as well as published on the Company’s website. As 2020 AGM was the first virtual general 

meeting held by the Company, the notice convening such meeting was published 25 days in advance of the date of the 2020 AGM, to allow 

amble time for the dissemination of details relating to the alternative arrangements for the 2020 AGM.

Rules (including the appointment of proxy(ies) and voting procedures) that govern the attendance for general meetings are clearly set out in 

the notice of general meeting as well as the proxy form. Pursuant to the Constitution, every Shareholder is entitled to attend and vote at the 

general meetings of the Company and is allowed to appoint not more than two (2) proxies to vote on his/her behalf at the general meetings 

during his/her absence. Notwithstanding, specified intermediaries such as CPF, banks and capital market services license holders which provide 

custodial services are allowed to appoint multiple proxies.

Sufficient and necessary information required for Shareholders to make informed decisions is provided or accompanied by the notice convening 

each general meeting. At general meetings, each issue is proposed as a separate resolution. The Company adopted and complied with voting 

process stipulated under the Guidance on the Conduct of General meetings amid Evolving COVID-19 Situation for the unconventional AGM 

held in year 2020. Shareholders (whether individual or corporate) who wish to vote on the resolutions tabled at the AGM have to appoint the 

chairman of the AGM as their proxy to attend, speak and vote on their behalf. The voting outcomes including the number of votes cast for and 

against were validated by the polling agent prior to the 2020 AGM, and results of the poll are displayed on-screen during the virtual meeting 

proceeding. The poll results also be announced to the public through SGXNet in accordance with the format prescribed under the Listing Manual.

The proceedings of general meetings are properly recorded and the minutes of the 2020 AGM are published on SGXNet and on the Company’s 

website within one (1) month after the meeting.

The record of Directors’ attendance at the general meeting held in FY2020 is set out on pages 73 to 76 of this annual report.

Dividend Policy. The Company currently does not have a fixed dividend policy, to allow greater flexibility on the capital management. 

It continually reviews strategic options to enhance shareholders value, including potential acquisitions or realisation of assets. As any of 

such strategic actions would affect the allocation of fund, the Company decided to review and/or determine its dividend policy at the most 

appropriate time. The Company recorded a net loss and consequently no dividend has been declared or recommended in respect of FY2020.

Engagement with Shareholders

The Company recognises that effective communication with investors assists the creation and maintenance of an informed market, and 

enhances corporate governance by encouraging a culture of transparency in relation to its corporate activities and proposals. The Company 

gives Shareholders a balanced and understandable assessment of its performance, position and prospects, and informs Shareholders immediately 

of any major or material developments or events that have an impact on the Group or may influence their investment decisions. To facilitate 

Shareholders’ rights and to ensure fair communication with the Shareholders, all information about the Company’s new initiatives which would 

be likely to materially affect the price or value of the Company’s shares are promptly disseminated to Shareholders through the following 

platforms:

(a) 

SGXNet announcements and news release;

(b) 

annual report and notice of general meetings issued to all Shareholders;

(c) 

press releases on major developments of the Group;

(d)

wholly-owned subsidiary of the Singapore Exchange Limited, is one of the Company’s major initiatives which aims to connect natural rubber 

stakeholders in the rubber industry and supports the Company’s commitment towards a more sustainable rubber industry. HeveaConnect 

digital marketplace aims to promote greater price transparency in the natural rubber market, and serves as an all-inclusive platform for farmers, 

producers, tyre manufacturers, as well as facilitators such as financial institutions, logistics and warehousing suppliers. Its goal is to be the 

leading digital marketplace for sustainable natural rubber and a trading platform, which promotes eco-friendly practices and embraces supply 

chain transparency.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant environmental, health and safety and social impacts, risks and challenges for workforces across 

the economies where the Group operates, disrupting supply chain and affecting considerations for stakeholder engagement. The Company 

remains committed to working with stakeholders and engages them at all levels including customers, competitors, industry associations, 

employees, regulators, and suppliers, to combat the COVID-19 impact and navigate the challenges.

Other information on the Group’s corporate social responsibility initiatives and engagements with material stakeholder groups is set out under 

the Sustainability Report contained within this annual report.

Anti-Corruption and Bribery

The Company is committed to conduct its business with integrity, fairness and transparency and does not tolerate corruption and bribery 

in any form, direct or indirect. It has procedures in place to comply with applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations. Under the Company’s 

Anti-Corruption and Bribery Policy, the Directors, Management and employees of the Group must not accept, offer, promise, or pay anything 

of value to another person with the intention to obtain or retain business, to improperly influence an official action or to secure an unfair 

business advantage, whether directly or through a third party.

DEALING IN SECURITIES

The Company observes and complies with Rule 1207(19) of the Listing Manual on dealings in securities and issues notices to its Directors, 

officers and employees on the restrictions in dealing in the Company’s securities during the period commencing one (1) month before the 

announcement of the Company’s half-yearly and full year financial results, and ending on the date of the announcement of the relevant 

results. Notices prohibiting dealing in Company’s securities will also be sent to the Group’s Directors, officers and employees as and when 

circumstances are deemed appropriate, such as when a discussion relating to an acquisition is expected to take a long period of time before 

it achieves certainty.

Directors, officers and employees are reminded periodically not to trade in the Company’s securities at any time while in possession of 

unpublished price sensitive information, and to refrain from dealing in the Company’s securities on short-term considerations. They are also 

advised to be mindful of the laws on insider trading at all times even when dealing in securities within the permitted trading period.

INTERESTED PERSON TRANSACTIONS

The assessment of IPT is under the purview of the AC, to ensure that any transaction to be entered into with interested persons (as defined in 

the Listing Manual) will be assessed independently, and that the transaction is carried out on normal commercial terms and are not prejudicial 

to the interests of the Company or its minority Shareholders.

Any contract to be made with an interested person will not be proceeded with unless the pricing is determined in accordance with the Group’s 

usual business practices and policies, consistent with the usual margin given or price received by the Group for the same or substantially similar 

type of transactions with the unrelated parties, and that the terms are not more favourable to the interested person than those extended to 

or received from unrelated parties. Where it is impractical or not possible to compare against the terms of other transactions with unrelated 

third parties or in situations where the products or services may be purchased only from an interested person, such IPT must be reviewed and 

approved by the AC, and the AC member who is perceived to be related to the interest person is refrained from deliberating, reviewing and 

approving that particular transaction.

DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT

102

Halcyon Agri    Corporate Report 2020

Book 2:  Corporate Governance and Financial Reports


Report on the audit of the financial statement

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Halcyon Agri Corporation Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”), 

which comprise the statements of financial position of the Group and the Company as at 31 December 2020, the consolidated income statement, 

consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated cash flow statement of the Group and the statements of changes in equity 

of the Group and the Company for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting 

policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group, the statement of financial position and the statement of 

changes in equity of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, Chapter 50 (the “Act”) and 

Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)”) so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of 

the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2020 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated 

changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group and changes in equity of the Company for the year then ended.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (“SSA”s). Our responsibilities under those standards are further 

described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in 

accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants 

and Accounting Entities (“ACRA Code”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in 

Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that 

the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the 

current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 

thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the 

matter is provided in that context.

We have fulfilled our responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report, 

including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment 

of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to 

address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements.

1. 

Impairment of goodwill and process know-how

As at 31 December 2020, the Group’s goodwill and process know-how amounted to US$286,379,000 and US$10,000,000 respectively. 

These represent approximately 40% of the Group’s net assets.

We focused on the impairment assessment of goodwill and process know-how because the impairment testing of the cash generating 

units (“CGUs”) attributable to these intangibles rely on estimates of value-in-use (“VIU”) based on the CGU’s expected future cash flows. 

We considered audit of these cash flow projections to be a key audit matter as these involved significant management judgment, and 

are based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market and economic conditions. In addition, judgment has also been 

exercised by management in identifying the appropriate CGUs for the impairment test.

The Group uses assumptions in respect of future market and economic conditions such as forecasted rubber price, forecasted sales 

volume and margin, growth rates and pre-tax discount rates. We assessed and tested these assumptions which the outcome of the 

impairment test is most sensitive and data inputs by comparing them to historical performance of the CGU and industry outlook reports. 

We engaged our valuation specialists to assist us with the audit of the reasonableness of management’s valuation methodologies and 

certain assumptions used.

We also reviewed the Group’s process in identifying changes to CGUs to which goodwill and/or intangible assets have been allocated to. 

We obtained and evaluated management’s sensitivity analyses to ascertain the impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions 

and we performed our own independent sensitivity calculations to quantify the downside changes to management’s models required 

to result in an impairment.

We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures concerning those key assumptions to which the outcome of the impairment test is most 

sensitive. The disclosures on goodwill and process know-how and key assumptions are included in Note 11 to the financial statements.

2. 

Measurement of biological assets

As at 31 December 2020, biological assets of the Group amounted to US$355,384,000 (2019: US$299,466,000). The Group’s biological 

assets, which mainly comprised of latex and rubber trees, are fair valued by professional independent valuers engaged by the Group using 

industry/market accepted valuation methodology. Due to the measurement of fair value being inherently judgement and significance of 

the amount as at the year end, we have considered this to be a key audit matter.

We had obtained the valuation of biological assets prepared by independent professional valuers engaged by the Group. The fair 

value reports are reviewed by us together with our valuation specialists for appropriateness of the fair value methodology used and 

reasonableness of the assumptions used which include forecast cash flows, discount rates and yield rates for the plantation and market 

prices of the latex and log. We assessed the competence, capability and objectivity of the independent professional valuers and assessed 

the reasonableness of their conclusions having regard to the key assumptions mentioned above. We also evaluated the key assumptions 

such as yield rates for the plantation by comparing these assumptions to historical trends and assessed the reasonableness of the market 

price of the latex and log used by comparing these against available external market data.

We have also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in relation to biological assets included in Note 16 to the financial statements.

INDEPENDENT

AUDITOR’S REPORT

To the members of Halcyon Agri Corporation Limited

103

Halcyon Agri    Corporate Report 2020

Book 2:  Corporate Governance and Financial Reports

Other information

Management is responsible for other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does 

not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 

the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to 

be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, 

we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the 

Act and SFRS(I), and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that 

assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded 

as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 

as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate 

the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 

whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 

is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 

can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 

the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 

We also:

• 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform 

audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 

collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

• 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 

circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

• 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made 

by management.

• 

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 

obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to 

continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report 

to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 

based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group 

to cease to continue as a going concern.

• 

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial 

statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

• 

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to 

express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. 

We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 

including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 

communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, 

related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial 

statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 

rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so 

would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

1. 

Corporate information

Halcyon Agri Corporation Limited (the “Company”) is a public limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Singapore and is 

listed on the Main Board of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited.

The registered office of the Company is located at 180 Clemenceau Avenue, #05-02 Haw Par Centre, Singapore 239922.

As at 31 December 2020, the Company is 54.99% owned by Sinochem International (Overseas) Pte. Ltd, a company incorporated  

and domiciled in Singapore. The penultimate holding company is Sinochem International Corporation Co., Ltd. (“SIC”), which is domiciled 

in the People’s Republic of China and listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. SIC is indirectly owned by 中国中化集团公司(also known 

as Sinochem Group) (“ultimate holding company”), a state-owned enterprise of the People’s Republic of China.

The principal activity of the Company is investment holding. The principal activities of the subsidiaries and associates are disclosed in 

Note 14(a) and Note 14(b) to the financial statements respectively.

2. 

Summary of significant accounting policies

2.1 

Basis of preparation

The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity of the 

Company have been prepared in accordance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)”).

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except as disclosed in the accounting policies below.

The financial statements are presented in United States Dollar (“USD” or “US$”) and all values in the tables are rounded to the nearest 

thousand (“US$’000”) unless otherwise indicated.

As of 31 December 2020, the balance sheet of the Group shows a net current liability position of US$240,530,000 (2019: net current asset 

position of US$38,724,000) which was predominantly due to the reclassification of a long-term loan amounting to US$300,000,000 (the 

“Loan”) due by December 2021 (i.e. due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period).

Subsequent to 31 December 2020, the Company has successfully secured a syndicated loan to refinance the Loan before it comes due 

as disclosed in Note 39(c). As such, the Board believe that the going concern assumption remain appropriate in the preparation of the 

financial statements.

NOTES TO THE 

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the financial year ended 31 December 2020

Halcyon Agri    Corporate Report 2020

Book 2:  Corporate Governance and Financial Reports


2. 

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.3 

Basis of consolidation and business combinations

(a) 

Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at the end of the 

reporting period. The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are 

prepared for the same reporting date as the Company. Consistent accounting policies are applied to like transactions and events 

in similar circumstances.

All intra-group balances, income and expenses and unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends 

are eliminated in full.

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be 

consolidated until the date that such control ceases.

Losses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance.

A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group 

loses control over a subsidiary, it:

– 

derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amounts at the date when control 

is lost;

– 

derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest;

– 

derecognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity;

– 

recognises the fair value of the consideration received;

– 

recognises the fair value of any investment retained;

– 

recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss;

– 

re-classifies the Group’s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss or 

retained earnings, as appropriate.

(b) 

Business combinations and goodwill

Where a business combination involves entities or businesses under common control, it is outside the scope of SFRS(I) 3 and may be 

accounted for using the pooling of interest method or the acquisition method. Acquisition method is applied when the transaction 

has substance from the perspective of the Group in accordance with SFRS(I) 3.

Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognised 

as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent 

changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, will be recognised in accordance 

with SFRS(I) 1-39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified 

as equity, it is not remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.

The Group elects for each individual business combination, whether non-controlling interest in the acquiree (if any), that are present 

ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of net assets in the event of liquidation, is recognised on 

the acquisition date at fair value, or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 

Other components of non-controlling interests are measured at their acquisition date fair value, unless another measurement 

basis is required by another SFRS(I).

Any excess of the sum of the fair value of the consideration transferred in the business combination, the amount of non-controlling 

interest in the acquiree (if any), and the fair value of the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), over the 

net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The accounting policy for goodwill is set 

out in Note 2.11(a). In instances where the latter amount exceeds the former, the excess is recognised as gain on bargain purchase 

in profit or loss on the acquisition date.

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.4 

Transactions with non-controlling interests

Non-controlling interests represents the equity in subsidiaries not attributable, directly or indirectly, to owners of the Company.

Changes in the Company’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. 

In such circumstances, the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their 

relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair 

value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company.

2.5 

Subsidiaries

A subsidiary is an investee that is controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable 

returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.

In the Company’s separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment losses.

2.6 

Associates

An associate is an entity over which the Group has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee 

but does not have control or joint control of those policies.

The Group account for its investments in associates using the equity method from the date on which it becomes an associate. On 

acquisition of the investment, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the investee’s 

identifiable assets and liabilities is accounted as goodwill and is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the 

Group’s share of the net fair value of the investee’s identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment is included as income 

in the determination of the entity’s share of the associate’s profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.

Under the equity method, the investment in associates are carried in the statement of financial position at cost plus post-acquisition 

changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associates. The profit or loss reflects the share of results of the operations of the 

associate. Distributions received from associates reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Where there has been a change 

recognised in other comprehensive income by the associates, the Group recognises its share of such changes in other comprehensive 

income. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and associate are eliminated to the extent of the 

interest in the associates.

When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does not recognise further 

losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an additional impairment loss on the 

Group’s investment in associate. The Group determines at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that 

the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between 

the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount in profit or loss.

The financial statements of the associates are prepared as the same reporting date as the Company. Where necessary, adjustments are 

made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.

2.7 

Foreign currency

The financial statements are presented in United States Dollar (“USD”), which is also the Company’s functional currency. Each entity in 

the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that 

functional currency.

(a) 

Transactions and balances

Transactions in foreign currencies are measured in the respective functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries and are 

recorded on initial recognition in the functional currencies at exchange rates approximating those ruling at the transaction dates. 

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling as at the statement 

of financial position date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated 

using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at the end of the reporting 

period are recognised in profit or loss.

(b) 

Consolidated financial statements

For consolidation purpose, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into USD at the rate of exchange ruling at 

the statement of financial position date and their profit or loss are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the 

transactions. The exchange differences arising on the translation are recognised in other comprehensive income. On disposal of 

a foreign operation, the component of other comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in 

profit or loss.

2.8 

Property, plant and equipment

All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent to recognition, property, plant and equipment are 

measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. The cost includes the cost of replacing part 

of the property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production 

of a qualifying property, plant and equipment. The accounting policy for borrowing costs is set out in Note 2.18. The cost of an item of 

property, plant and equipment is recognised as an asset if, and only if, it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the 

item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced in intervals, the Group recognises such parts as 

individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciation, respectively. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is 

recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair 

and maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Leasehold improvements and renovation

–

10 years

Office equipment

–

2 years

Computers and software

–

1 to 10 years

Leasehold buildings

–

20 years

Plant and machinery

–

10 years

Vehicles

–

4 to 10 years

Leasehold land

–

20 to 95 years

Freehold land is not depreciated.

Assets under construction included in property, plant and equipment are not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use.

Plantation establishment costs, consisting of costs directly incurred during the period of plantation development, are not depreciated. 

The establishment costs will be transferred to plantation assets and will be subject to depreciation upon commencement of rubber 

tapping activities.

The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate 

that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

The residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each financial year-end, and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use 

or disposal. Any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset is included in profit or loss in the year the asset is derecognised.

2.9 

Land use rights

Certain plantation lands in Cameroon were given land use rights by the State of Cameroon in 1996 for a period of 50 years plus 50 years, 

renewable at a nominal value to the Group. With the Group’s continuing investment in replanting and extension on the plantation land, 

the Group is of the view that it is not likely that the land use rights will not be renewed at the expiring of its current term. The land use 

rights is depreciated over its remaining useful life of 77 years.

2.10 Investment properties

Investment properties are properties that are owned by the Group that are held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation, or both, 

rather than for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, or in the ordinary course of business. 

Investment properties comprise completed investment properties and properties that are being constructed or developed for future 

use as investment properties. Properties held under operating leases are classified as investment properties when the definition of an 

investment property is met.

Investment properties are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.

Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values 

of investment properties are included in profit or loss in the year in which they arise.

Investment properties are derecognised when either they have been disposed of or when the investment property is permanently 

withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. Any gains or losses on the retirement or disposal of 

an investment property are recognised in profit or loss in the year of retirement or disposal.

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.11 Intangible assets

(a) 

Goodwill

Goodwill is initially measured at cost. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment 

losses.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to the 

Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other 

assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.

The cash-generating units to which goodwill have been allocated is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an 

indication that the cash-generating unit may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable 

amount of each cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable 

amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. Impairment 

losses recognised for goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods.

Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that cash-generating unit is disposed of, the 

goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain 

or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative fair values of the 

operations disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.

(b) 

Other intangible assets

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured initially at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination 

is their fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial acquisition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated 

amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development 

costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in profit or loss in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised over the estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment whenever there 

is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method are reviewed at 

least at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic 

benefits embodied in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated 

as changes in accounting estimates.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives or not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if the 

events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. 

Such intangible assets are not amortised. The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to 

determine whether the useful life assessment continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite 

is made on a prospective basis.

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 

and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.

(i) 

Process know-how

The useful life of the process know-how was estimated to be indefinite because based on the current demand for rubber, 

management believes there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the process know-how are expected to generate 

net cash inflows for the Group.

(ii) 

Customer relationship

Customer relationship acquired was initially recognised at cost and was subsequently carried at cost less accumulated 

amortization and accumulated impairment losses. These costs are amortised to the income statement using the straight line 

method over 10 years.

(iii) 

Computer software

Acquired computer software licences are initially capitalised at cost and was subsequently carried at cost less accumulated 

amortization and accumulated impairment losses. These costs are amortised to the income statement using the straight line 

method over 5 years.

2.12 Bearer plants and biological assets

The classification of rubber trees as bearer plant or non-bearer plant depends on the business plan for respective rubber plantations, 

pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the trees, plantation and relevant market or industry considerations. Rubber trees are not 

considered bearer plant when there is commercially viable plan to convert the rubber trees into products other than incidental scrap at 

the end of the rubber production life to an established market.

Bearer plants consist of the oil palm trees in the Malaysian plantation and rubber trees in Ivory Coast plantation. Cultivation of seedlings 

is stated at cost. The accumulated cost will be classified as immature plantations at the time of planting. Mature plantations are stated 

at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. The Group concluded that depreciating the mature plantations by the expected 

yield pattern of the bearer plants over their useful lives, estimated at 30 years, is more reflective of the pattern in which the assets 

future benefit are expected to be consumed. The carrying value of bearer plants are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 

circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. A bearer plant is derecognised upon disposal or when no future 

economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the bearer plant is included in the 

profit or loss when the bearer plant is derecognised.

Biological assets consist of rubber latex and rubber trees in the Malaysian and Cameroonian plantations, produce that grows on oil palm 

trees in the Malaysian plantations and rubber latex in Ivory Coast plantation. These are measured at fair value less estimate costs to sell. 

Gains or losses arising on initial recognition of plantations at fair value less estimated costs to sell and from the changes in fair value less 

estimated costs to sell of plantations at each reporting date are included in profit or loss for the period in which they arise.

In the financial year ended 31 December 2019, the Group reclassified the Cameroon plantation from bearer plant to biological assets. 

Fair value gain arising from reclassification of rubber trees from bearer plants to non-bearer plants is recognised in profit or loss in the 

year of reclassification.

Further details are disclosed in Note 3.1(a).

2.13 Impairment of non-financial assets

The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when 

an annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount.

An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use and 

is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other 

assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is 

considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations which are prepared separately for each of the 

Group’s cash-generating units to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering 

a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.

Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in profit or loss.

For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously 

recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s 

or cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in 

the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the 

carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increase cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have 

been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised previously.

2.14 Financial instruments

(a) 

Financial assets

Initial recognition and measurement

Financial assets are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial 

instrument. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value 

through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through 

profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.

Trade receivables are measured at the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for 

transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third party, if the trade receivables 

do not contain a significant financing component at initial recognition.

(a) 

Financial assets (cont’d)

Subsequent measurement

Debt instruments

(i) 

Amortised cost

Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of 

principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective 

interest method, less impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the assets are derecognised or 

impaired, and through the amortisation process.

(ii) 

Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets’ 

cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Financial assets measured at FVOCI 

are subsequently measured at fair value. Any gains or losses from changes in fair value of the financial assets are recognised 

in other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses, foreign exchange gains and losses and interest calculated 

using the effective interest method are recognised in profit or loss. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in 

other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment when the financial 

asset is derecognised.

(iii) 

Fair value through profit or loss

Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or 

loss on a debt instruments that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging 

relationship is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it arises.

Investments in equity instruments

On initial recognition of an investment in equity instrument that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present 

subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. Dividends from such investments are to be recognised in profit or loss when the Group’s 

right to receive payments is established. For investments in equity instruments which the Group has not elected to present 

subsequent changes in fair value in OCI, changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.

Derivatives

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date of derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured 

to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recognised in profit or loss.

Derecognition

A financial asset is derecognised where the contractual right to receive cash flows from the asset has expired. On derecognition 

of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and any 

cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in profit or loss.

(b) 

Financial liabilities

Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial 

instrument. The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus in the case of financial liabilities not at fair value through profit or 

loss, directly attributable transaction costs.

Subsequent measurement

After initial recognition, financial liabilities that are not carried at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently measured 

at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are 

derecognised, and through the amortisation process.

Derecognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expired. When an existing 

financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are 

substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition 

of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss.

(c) 

Gain/loss on commodity contracts

Commodity contracts to buy and sell natural rubber commodities can be subject to net settlement if market conditions are 

favourable. Such commodity contracts and derivative financial instruments are marked to market at market rates prevailing at 

the end of the reporting period. Unrealised gains or losses are taken to profit or loss. Market value is generally based on listed 

market prices. If listed market prices are not available, market value is determined based on relevant factors, including trade price 

quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the commodities and price quotations for similar commodities traded in 

different markets, including markets located in different geographical areas.

2.15 Impairment of financial assets

The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (“ECLs”) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or 

loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows 

that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will 

include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.

ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial 

recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that resulted from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (a 12 month 

ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is 

recognised for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposures, irrespective of timing of the default (an ECL).

For trade receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit 

risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is 

based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

For debt instruments at fair value through OCI, the Group applies the low credit risk simplification. At every reporting date, the Group 

evaluates whether the debt instrument is considered to have low credit risk using all reasonable and supportable information that is 

available without undue cost or effort. In making that evaluation, the Group reassess the internal credit rating of the debt instrument. 

In addition, the Group considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when the contractual payments are more than 

90 days past due.

The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 365 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Group 

may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal and external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive 

the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is 

written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.

2.16 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand and short term deposits that are readily convertible to known amount of 

cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

2.17 Inventories

Inventories except consumables are carried at the fair market value at the end of each reporting period, whereby the resulting unrealised 

gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. This is an alternative policy allowed by SFRS(I) 1-2 Inventories for commodity broker or trader, 

as this better reflect the performance of the Group. The Group’s operating activities, including procurement of raw materials, selling 

of finished goods and entering into forward commodity (natural rubber) contracts are subject to movements in the market prices of 

natural rubber. The Group has two main types of sales contracts and purchase contracts; long term contracts (“LTCs”) and spot contracts 

(“Spot”). The prices for LTCs are usually determined based on the average market price preceding the delivery months, whereas the 

prices for Spot contracts are usually agreed on the day the Spot contracts are entered. In addition to the management of the price risk 

between the sales and purchase activities, which is the key driver and contributor to the Group’s profitability, the Group also provided 

other ancillary services such as processing and distribution. The profit for these ancillary services is recognised in the profit or loss only 

when these services are performed by the Group.

Consumables are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable 

value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and 

distribution.

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.18 Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs are capitalised as part of the cost of a qualifying asset if they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or 

production of that asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale 

are in progress and the expenditures and borrowing costs are incurred. Borrowing costs are capitalised until the assets are substantially 

completed for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. Borrowing costs consist of 

interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.

2.19 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that 

an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can 

be estimated reliably.

Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer probable that 

an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed. If the effect of the

time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific 

to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

2.20 Employee benefits

(a) 

Retirement benefit costs

Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense when employees have rendered the services 

entitling them to the contributions. Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes, such as the Singapore Central 

Provident Fund, are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the group’s obligations under the plans are 

equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan.

For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, 

with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and 

losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected 

immediately in the statement of financial position with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period 

in which they occur. Remeasurement recognised in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and 

will not be reclassified to profit or loss. Service costs which include current service cost, past service cost and gains or losses on 

non-routine settlement are recognised as expense in profit or loss. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate based 

on high quality long term bonds at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Net interest on the net 

defined benefit liability or asset is recognised as expense or income in profit or loss.

Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows:

• 

Service cost;

• 

Net interest expense or income of the net retirement benefit obligation; and

• 

Re-measurements of net retirement benefit obligation

The Group presents the first two components of defined benefit costs in profit or loss in the line item ‘Employee benefit expense’. 

Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past service costs.

The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the statement of financial position represents the actual deficit or surplus in the 

group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits 

available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plan.

A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of the termination 

benefit and when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs.

(b) 

Employee leave entitlement

Employees’ entitlement to annual leave is recognised as a liability when they are accrued to the employees. The undiscounted 

liability for leave expected to be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of the reporting period is recognised for services 

rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting period.

2.21 Leases

The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control 

the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

Group as a lessee

The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value 

assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying 

assets.

(i) 

Right-of-use assets

The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available 

for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any 

remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct 

costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use 

assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.

If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase 

option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.

The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting policies in Note 2.13.

(ii) 

Lease liabilities

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments 

to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease 

incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual 

value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the 

Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. 

Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce 

inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement 

date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of 

lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying 

amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., 

changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in 

the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.

(iii) 

Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of machinery and equipment (i.e., those 

leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also 

applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered to be low value. Lease 

payments on short-term leases and leases of low value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Group as a lessor

Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are classified as 

operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the 

statement of profit or loss due to its operating nature. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are 

added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent 

rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.

2.22 Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations

Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held-for-sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less 

costs to sell. Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held-for-sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally 

through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. A component of the Group is classified as a ‘discontinued operation’ 

when the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale have been met or it has been disposed of and such a component represents a separate 

major line of business or geographical area of operations or is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of 

business or geographical area of operations.

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets once classified as held-for-sale are not depreciated or amortised.

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.23 Revenue

Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods 

or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.

Revenue is recognised when the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring promised goods or services to the customer, 

which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service. A performance obligation may be satisfied at a point in time or over 

time. The amount of revenue recognised is the amount allocated to the satisfied performance obligation.

(a) 

Sale of goods

Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when goods are delivered to the customer and all criteria for acceptance have been 

satisfied.

(b) 

Interest income

Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.

(c) 

Rental income

Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease 

terms. The aggregate costs of incentives provided to lessees are recognised as a reduction of rental income over the lease term 

on a straight-line basis.

2.24 Taxes

(a) 

Current income tax

Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered 

from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or 

substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.

Current income taxes are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items recognised outside profit 

or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax 

returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where 

appropriate.

(b) 

Deferred tax

Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the end of the reporting period between the tax 

bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences, except:

– 

Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that 

is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or 

loss; and

– 

In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint 

ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary 

differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused 

tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, 

and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except:

– 

Where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or 

liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting 

profit nor taxable profit or loss; and

– 

In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint 

ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse 

in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no 

longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised 

deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable 

that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.24 Taxes (cont’d)

(b) 

Deferred tax (cont’d)

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised 

or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of each 

reporting period.

Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised 

in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and deferred tax arising 

from a business combination is adjusted against goodwill on acquisition.

Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date, would 

be recognised subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances changed. The adjustment would either be treated as 

a reduction to goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it is incurred during the measurement period or in profit or loss.

(c) 

Sales tax

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except:

– 

Where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case 

the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and

– 

Receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of sales tax included.

The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of other receivables or other 

payables in the statement of financial position.

2.25 Share capital and share issuance expenses

Proceeds from issuance of ordinary shares are recognised as share capital in equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance 

of ordinary shares are deducted against share capital.

Fair valuation of shares is based on the prevailing market price as at the date of issuance.

2.26 Perpetual securities

The perpetual securities do not have a maturity date and the Company is able to elect to defer any scheduled distribution perpetually 

subject to the terms and conditions of the securities issue. Accordingly, the Company is not considered to have a contractual obligation 

to make principal repayments or distributions in respect of its perpetual securities issue and the perpetual securities are presented within 

equity. Distributions are treated as dividends which will be directly debited from equity. Costs directly attributable to the issue of the 

perpetual securities are deducted against the proceeds from the issue.

On the election of the Company to redeem the perpetual securities, the perpetual securities will be reclassified as a financial liability. 

The financial liability is initially recognised at fair value and any difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the previously 

recognised equity instrument is recognised in equity.

No gain or loss is recognised in the profit or loss on the reclassification.

2.27 Contingencies

A contingent liability is:

(a) 

a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence 

of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group; or

(b) 

a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:

(i) 

it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or

(ii) 

the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or 

non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.

Contingent liabilities and assets are not recognised on the statement of financial position of the Group, except for contingent liabilities 

assumed in a business combination that are present obligations and which the fair values can be reliably determined.

2.28 Segment reporting

For management purposes, the Group is organised into operating segments based on their business units. Management regularly reviews 

the segment results in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess the segment performance. Additional disclosures on 

each of these segments are shown in Note 35, including the factors used to identify the reportable segments and the measurement 

basis of segment information.

2.29 Government grant

Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will 

be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the 

related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. When the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as income in 

equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset.

When the Group receives grants of non-monetary assets, the asset and the grant are recorded at nominal amounts and released to profit 

or loss over the expected useful life of the asset, based on the pattern of consumption of the benefits of the underlying asset by equal 

annual instalments.

3. 

Significant accounting judgements and estimates

The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 

that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of 

each reporting period. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment 

to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in the future periods.

3.1 

Judgements made in applying accounting policies

In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, apart from those involving 

estimations, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:

(a) 

Classification of rubber trees as bearer plants or non-bearer plants

The Group has rubber plantations in Malaysia and Cameroon.

The classification of rubber trees as bearer plant or non-bearer plant depends on the business plan for respective rubber plantations, 

pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the trees, plantation and relevant market or industry considerations. Rubber trees 

are not considered bearer plant when there is commercially viable plan to sell the rubber tree as lumber to an established market.

The Group has assessed that there is an established commercial market for end-of-life rubber trees in Malaysia and Cameroon, 

and it is the Group’s business plan to convert the rubber trees into products other than incidental scrap at the end of the rubber 

production life.

The reclassification of Cameroon rubber plantations from bearer plant in the financial year ended 31 December 2019 is due to the 

improvement in accessibility spurred by new transportation infrastructure near the Group’s Cameroonian plantations, which has 

rendered selling harvested rubber trees to key markets to be commercially viable. The change in circumstances led to the Group’s 

plan to establish relevant arrangements to convert the harvested rubber trees into commercially valuable by-products. As such, 

the classification has changed accordingly in December 2019. Fair value gain on biological assets of US$53,250,000 has been 

recognised on the date of the reclassification of Cameroon’s rubber plantation from bearer plant to non-bearer plant. Subsequent 

changes in fair value less estimated costs to sell of plantations at each reporting date are included in profit or loss for the period 

in which they arise.

Further details are disclosed in Note 2.12.

(b) 

Impairment of goodwill and process know-how

Judgement has been made by the Group to identify the cash-generating units and assess the future market and economic 

assumptions, such as forecasted rubber price, forecasted sales volume, growth rate and pre-tax discount rates. The Group has 

estimated the recoverable amounts of cash-generating units to which goodwill and process know-how has been allocated to, 

based on value-in-use approach. Estimates used in deriving the value-in-use, are disclosed in Note 3.2(a).

Significant accounting judgements and estimates (cont’d)

3.2 

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period are 

discussed below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. 

Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances 

arising beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

(a) 

Impairment of goodwill and process know-how

Determining whether goodwill and process know-how is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating-

unit to which the goodwill and process know-how have been allocated.

The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows that is expected to arise, the growth rate used 

for extrapolation purposes and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The key assumptions applied in the 

determination of the value in use including a sensitivity analysis are disclosed and further explained in Note 11 to the financial 

statements. The Group’s carrying amount of goodwill and process know-how at 31 December 2020 is US$296,379,000 (2019: 

US$296,379,000).

(b) 

Measurement of biological assets

The fair value of biological assets is estimated using the discounted cash flow model (“DCF”) by independent professional valuers. 

This requires an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the biological assets to be made and a suitable discount rate to be 

chosen, in order to calculate the present value of future cash flows. The valuation of these biological assets is particularly sensitive 

to discount rates as disclosed in Note 36(d)(i).

Process know-how

Process know-how relates to the production of a certain grade of rubber and has been allocated to the HRC Group. As explained in 

Note 2.11(b)(i), the intangible asset has been assessed as having indefinite life so long as there is a demand for such rubber. The Group 

expects continuance for such demand.

Goodwill

Goodwill acquired through business combinations have been allocated to following cash-generating units (“CGU”), for impairment testing:

Customer related intangibles

Customer related intangibles relates to non-contractual customer relationships acquired through business combination. The intangible 

asset has a remaining amortisation period of 4 to 7 years (2019: 5 to 8 years).

Computer software

Computer software has a remaining amortisation period of 3 to 5 years (2019: 4 to 6 years).

Trademark

Trademark has been fully amortised during the year (2019: remaining useful life of 1 year).

Impairment testing of goodwill and process know-how with indefinite life

The above goodwill and process know-how was tested for impairment as at 31 December 2020. No impairment loss was recognised as 

at 31 December 2020 as the recoverable amounts of the respective CGU to which goodwill and process know-how have been allocated 

to were in excess of their respective carrying values. The recoverable amount of the CGUs have been determined based on value in use 

calculations using five years cash flow projections from financial budgets approved by management and assumed a terminal growth 

rate thereafter.

11. Intangible assets (cont’d)

The calculations of value in use for the CGUs are most sensitive to the following assumptions:

Growth rates – The forecasted growth rates are based on published industry research and do not exceed the long term average growth 

rate for the industries relevant to the CGUs.

Pre-tax discount rates – Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each CGU, regarding the time 

value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets which have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates.

Rubber price – The forecasted rubber price is based on estimated rubber price published by an external industry report.

Gross profit per metric tonne – forecasted gross profit is based on estimated gross profit per metric tonne for the future years.

Sensitivity to changes in assumptions

Changes to the above assumptions used by management to determine the recoverable value can have significant impact on the results of 

the assessment. Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying 

amount of the unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount.

Assets pledged as security

In addition to assets held under lease obligation, the Group has pledged certain property, plant and equipment with a carrying amount 

of US$47,067,000 (2019: US$62,544,000) to secure the Group’s and the Company’s loans and borrowings (Note 26).

12(b) Right-of-use assets

The Group has lease contracts for land, office, vehicles and other equipment used in its operations with predominantly fixed payments 

over the lease terms. Some of these leases have terms of renewal but no purchase options or escalation clauses.

Leases of land and office generally have lease terms between 1 and 91 years, machinery and other equipment generally have lease terms 

between 1 and 5 years. Generally, the Group is restricted from assigning and subleasing the leased assets.

The Group also has certain leases of office and other equipment with lease terms of 12 months or less and leases of other equipment with 

low value. The Group applies the ‘short-term lease’ and ‘lease of low-value assets’ recognition exemption for these leases. The election 

of short-term lease and low-value-lease exemption is made on lease-by-lease basis.

Set out below are the carrying amount of right-of-use assets recognised and the movements during the period:

The Group’s biological assets mainly consist of rubber trees in Malaysia and Cameroonian plantations and produce that grows on oil palm 

trees in Malaysia plantation, all of which are grown for commercial sales as part of normal business operations.

Interest expense amounting to US$10,040,000 was capitalised in 2020 (2019: US$11,085,000). The rate used to determine the amount 

of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation was 2.77% – 7.15% (2019: 3.81% – 7.15%) per annum, which is the effective interest rate of

The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding other assumptions constant. Changes in some of the 

assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the retirement benefit obligations to significant actuarial assumptions, 

the same method (present value of the retirement benefit obligations calculated with the Projected Unit Credit method at the end of the 

reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the retirement benefit obligations recognised within the statement of financial 

position.

Through its retirement benefit pension plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed as 

below:

Changes in bond yields

A decrease in government bond yield will increase plan liabilities.

Inflation risk

The majority of the plan’s benefit obligations are linked to inflation which higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.

The weighted average duration of the retirement benefits obligation is 16.8 years (2019: 18.1 years).

29. Perpetual securities

Financial year ended 31 December 2019

During the financial year ended 31 December 2017, the Company issued perpetual securities with principal amount of US$150,000,000 

bearing distributions at rate of 4.50% per annum. An amount of US$148,690,000 net of issuance costs, was recognised in equity. During 

the financial year 2019, the Board of Directors approved to distribute payment amounting to US$3,375,000 to the holders of the securities. 

On 26 April 2019, the Group has redeemed all the principal amount of the perpetual securities of US$150,000,000.

Financial year ended 31 December 2020

During the financial year ended 31 December 2020, the Company issued guaranteed subordinated perpetual securities with principal 

amount of US$200,000,000 bearing distribution rate of 3.80% per annum. In the event of non-redemption by the Company in November 

2025, the distribution rate will be reset and every five calendar years thereafter to a distribution rate equivalent to the sum of (a) the initial 

spread of 3.345%, (b) the then-prevailing five-year U.S. treasury rate and (c) a margin of 3.00% per annum. The perpetual securities were 

unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Sinochem International Corporation, the major shareholder of the Company. An amount 

of US$192,640,000 net of issuance costs and guarantee fees, was recognised in equity.

The perpetual securities bear distributions which are payable semi-annually. Subject to the relevant terms and conditions of the perpetual 

securities, the Company may elect to defer any scheduled distribution perpetually on the perpetual securities and is not subject to any 

limits as to the number of times a distribution can be deferred.

The perpetual securities are classified as equity and distributions are treated as dividends. This is on the basis that the Company has no 

contractual obligations to repay its principal or to pay any distributions. As a result, the instrument does not meet the definition as a 

financial liability under SFRS(I) 1-32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation.

33. Financial risks and management (cont’d)

(b) 

Financial risk management policies and objectives

The Group and the Company is exposed to financial risks arising from its operations and the use of financial instruments. The 

key financial risks include foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and commodity price risk. The Group 

has documented financial risk management policies. These policies set out the Group’s overall business strategies and its risk 

management philosophy. The Group’s overall financial risk management programme seeks to minimise potential adverse effects 

on the financial performance of the Group.

The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to these financial risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.

(i) 

Foreign currency risk

As disclosed in Note 2.7 of the financial statements, the functional currency of the Company is the United States Dollar.

The Group faces foreign exchange risk as its borrowings, export sales and the costs of certain purchases are denominated in 

a currency other than the respective functional currencies of the Group entities, primarily Singapore Dollar, Euro, Indonesian 

Rupiah, Malaysian Ringgit, Chinese Yuan Renminbi, CFA Franc and Thai Baht. The Group also holds cash and short-term 

deposits denominated in foreign currencies for working capital purposes.

The Group enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposure for some of its receivables.

Foreign currency sensitivity

The following table details the sensitivity to a 5% increase and decrease in the relevant foreign currencies against the 

functional currency of each Group entity. 5% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to 

key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange 

rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their 

translation at the period end for a 5% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well 

as loans to foreign operations within the Group where they gave rise to an impact on the Group’s profit or loss and/or equity.

If the relevant foreign currency strengthens by 5% against the functional currency of each Group entity, income will increase/

(decrease) by:

It excludes the effect of foreign currency exposure that has been materially hedged.

(ii) 

Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group’s and the Company’s financial instruments 

will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s primary interest rate risk arises from its loan payables.

The Group’s exposures to interest rates are set out below.

Interest rate sensitivity

The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments 

at the end of the reporting period and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held 

constant throughout the reporting period in the case of instruments that have floating rates. A 50 basis point increase or 

decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s 

assessment of the possible change in interest rates.

If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s income 

for the financial year would decrease/increase by US$3,848,000 (2019: decrease/increase by US$4,540,000). This is mainly 

attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its balance due to the banks and financial institutions, and certain 

loan receivables.

(b) 

Financial risk management policies and objectives (cont’d)

(iii) 

Credit risk

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the 

Group. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral 

where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Group’s exposure and the credit 

ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst 

approved counterparties.

The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any Group of counterparties having 

similar characteristics. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities. The 

credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are creditworthy entities.

The maximum exposure to credit risk in the event that the counterparties fail to perform their obligations as at the end of 

the reporting period in relation to each class of recognised financial assets is the carrying amount of those assets as stated 

in the statement of financial position.

The Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been a significant 

increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period.

The Group has determined the default event on a financial asset to be when the counterparty fails to make contractual 

payments, within 90 days of when they fall due, which are derived based on the Group’s historical information.

To assess whether there is significant increase in credit risk, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the asset 

as at reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. The Group considers available reasonable and 

supportive forward-looking information which includes the following indicators:

– 

Internal credit rating

– 

External credit rating

– 

Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause 

a significant change to the borrower’s ability to meet its obligation

– 

Actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the borrower

– 

Significant increases in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same borrower

– 

Significant changes in the value of the collateral supporting the obligation or in the quality of third party guarantees 

or credit enhancements

– 

Significant changes in the expected performance and behaviour of the borrower, including changes in the payment 

status of borrowers in the group and changes in the operating results of the borrower.

Regardless of the analysis above, a significant increase in credit risk is presumed if a debtor is more than 90 days past due 

in making contractual payment.

The Group determined that its financial assets are credit-impaired when:

– 

There is significant difficulty of the issuer or the borrower

– 

A breach of contract, such as a default or past due event

– 

It is becoming probably that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation

– 

There is disappearance of an active market for the financial asset because of financial difficulty

The Group categorises a loan or receivable for potential write-off when a debtor fails to make contractual payments more 

than 365 days past due. Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as a debtor 

failing to engage in repayment plan with the Group. Where loans and receivables have been written off, the Group continues 

to engage enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivable due. Where recoveries are made, these are recognised 

in profit or loss.

The following are credit risk management practices and qualitative information about amount arising from expected credit 

losses for each class of financial assets.

(A) 

Trade receivables

The Group provides for expected credit losses (“ECL”) for all trade receivables using a provision matrix. The provision 

rates are determined based on the Group’s historical observed default rates analyse in accordance to days past due by 

grouping of customers which are:

– 

HRC Group

– 

Corrie MacColl Group

(B) 

Other receivables

The Group provides for ECL for all financial assets based on general approach of 12-months ECL either individual or 

collective basis.

The Group has performed specific credit risk assessment on the loan to a third party. The Group assessed the latest 

performance and financial position of the counterparties, adjusted for the future outlook of the industry in which the 

counterparties operate in, and concluded that there has been no significant increase in the credit risk since the initial 

recognition of the financial assets. Accordingly, the Group measured the impairment loss allowance using 12-month 

ECL and determined that the ECL is insignificant.

(C) 

Debt instruments

During the year, the non-current debt instrument is recognised initially at fair value. Further details of the initial 

recognition are disclosed in Note 17. Subsequently, the Group assess and record the ECL for debt instrument based on 

general approach of 12-months ECL and computes the ECL based on probability-weighted scenario analysis.

Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group or the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting financial obligations due to shortage 

of funds. The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from mismatches of the maturities of 

financial assets and liabilities.

The Group maintains sufficient liquidity at all times by efficient cash and working capital management.

The Group’s ability to meet its obligations is managed by maintaining appropriate level of cash balance and working capital 

balances.

Subsequent to 31 December 2020, the Company has successfully secured a syndicated loan to refinance the Loan before it 

comes due as disclosed in Note 39(c). As such, the Board believe that the going concern assumption remain appropriate in 

the preparation of the financial statements.

Non-derivative financial instruments

The following tables detail the remaining contractual maturity for non-derivative financial instruments.

The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on 

which the Group can be required to pay. The tables include both interest and principal cash flows. The adjustment column 

represents the possible future interest cash outflow attributable to the instrument included in the maturity analysis which are 

not included in the carrying amount of the financial asset or liabilities on the statement of financial position.

Financial risk management policies and objectives (cont’d)

(iv) 

Liquidity risk (cont’d)

Derivative financial instruments

The liquidity analysis for derivative financial instruments has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash inflows/

(outflows) on the derivative instrument that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross inflows and outflows on those 

derivatives that require gross settlement. When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been 

determined by reference to the projected interest rates as illustrated by the yield curves existing at the end of the reporting 

period.

Please refer to Note 21 for more details.

(v) 

Commodity price risk

Due to the nature of the Group’s operations, the Group is exposed to changes in agricultural commodity prices.

The Group managed the exposure on commodity price risk by utilising forward physical contracts and/or derivatives to 

manage our open commodity positions. The Group also reviewed daily monitoring reports on market positioning to facilitate 

decision making process on our exposure.

At the end of the reporting period, a 5% increase/decrease of the commodities price index, with all other variables held 

constant, would have increased/decreased profit before income tax by US$430,000 (2019: increased/decreased profit 

before income tax by US$1,172,000) and increased/decreased equity by US$430,000 (2019: increased/decreased equity by 

US$1,172,000).

(a) 

Fair value hierarchies

The Group categorises fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that is dependent on the valuation inputs used as follows:

Level 1 –

Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active market for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at the 

measurement date,

Level 2 –

Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or 

indirectly, and

Level 3 –

Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

(b) 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value

Level 2 fair value measurements

The fair value of inventories (except consumables) are calculated using quoted prices in relevant commodity exchanges at the end 

of the reporting period, making adjustments according to the stage of production of the inventories, port of loading, and grades 

of products. Where such prices are not available, the Group uses valuation models to determine the fair values based on relevant 

factors, including trade price quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the commodities and commodity exchange 

price quotations and dealer quotations for similar commodities traded in different markets and geographical areas, existing at the 

end of the reporting period.

(d) 

Level 3 fair value measurements

(i) 

Information about significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements

Biological assets

The fair value of the Group’s major biological assets has been determined based on valuations by an independent professional 

valuer using the discounted cash flow valuation approach. The most significant inputs into the discounted cash flow valuation 

approach are the average annual yield and discount rate. The fair value of biological assets is computed using the following:

2020

2019

Malaysia

Average annual yield for oil palm and rubber trees in Malaysia plantation 

 (mT per ha)

1.7

1.7

Discount rate for oil palm and rubber trees in Malaysia plantation (%)

11.0

11.0

Average yield per tapping cycle for oil palm in Malaysia plantation 

 (mT per ha)

7.4

7.4

Cameroon

Average annual yield for rubber trees in Cameroon plantation 

 (mT per ha)

1.7 – 2.0

1.7 – 2.0

Discount rate for rubber trees in Cameroon plantation (%)

13.0

13.0

An increase in average annual yield per hectare will result in an increase to the fair value of biological assets, while an increase 

in discount rate will result in a decrease of estimated fair value.

At the end of the reporting period, a 1.0% increase/decrease in average annual yield will increase/decrease the fair value 

of biological asset by US$6,488,000 and a 0.5% increase/decrease in discount rate will decrease/increase the fair value of 

biological asset by US$19,577,000 for Cameroon plantations.

Investment properties

The fair value of the Group’s investment properties has been derived using the sales comparison approach. Sales prices of 

comparable properties in close proximity are adjusted for differences in key attributes such as property location, accessibility, 

topography, facilities and utilities, size and date of transaction.

Valuation policies and procedures

It is the Group’s policy to engage external valuation experts to perform the valuation of biological assets and investment 

properties. The management is responsible for selecting and engaging valuation experts that possess the relevant credentials 

and knowledge on the subject of valuation, valuation methodologies, and SFRS(I) 13 fair value measurement guidance.

Management reviews the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and assumptions adopted, and the reliability of 

the inputs used in the valuations.

(e) 

Fair value of financial instruments not measured at fair value and whose carrying amounts are reasonable approximation of 

fair value

The carrying amounts of cash and bank balances (Note 18), trade receivable (Note 19), loans and other receivables (Note 20), 

trade payables (Note 24), other payables (Note 25), and loan payables (Note 26) approximate their respective fair values due to the 

relatively short-term maturity of these financial instruments or that they are floating rate instruments that are re-priced to market 

interest rates on or near the statement of financial position date.

37. Dividends on ordinary shares

The Group has not paid dividend on ordinary shares during the Financial Year 2020 and 2019.

38. Capital management

The Group reviews its capital structure at least annually to ensure that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern, while 

maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. Refer to Note 2.1 for current year review.

The Group is required to comply with loan covenants imposed by the lenders, unless it is specifically waived by the lenders. This externally 

imposed requirement has been complied with by the Group in financial year ended 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2020, with 

the exception of loans of certain subsidiaries for financial year ended 31 December 2020. As at 31 December 2020, the subsidiaries 

obtained waivers from the banks for bank loans with carrying amount of US$180,861,000 (2019: US$97,540,000) for the non-fulfilment 

of financial covenants. The Company has obtained waiver from the bank to test certain financial covenants for a bank loan amounting 

to US$58,766,000 (2019: US$74,485,000) as at 31 December 2020.

The capital structure of the Group comprises only of issued capital and retained earnings. The Group manages its capital structure and 

makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the 

dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies 

or processes during the years ended 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019.

The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net borrowing divided by total equity. The Group includes within net borrowing, 

loans and borrowings, lease liabilities, adjusted for working capital items.

39. Event occurring after the reporting period

a) 

Striking-off a subsidiary

In February 2021, the Group struck off its wholly-owned dormant subsidiary, JFL Agro Sdn. Bhd. The deregistration did not result 

in any profit or loss impact.

b) 

Changes of interest in a subsidiary

In March 2021, a subsidiary of the Group, HeveaConnect Pte. Ltd. (“HeveaConnect”) issued 35,162 new ordinary shares (“HC shares”) 

to a third party for US$1,500,000 and the Company transferred 56,962 HC shares (the “Trust Shares”) into a trust managed and 

administered by an independent trustee.

Subsequent to the issuance of new HC shares and transfer of the Trust Shares, the Company’s effective shareholding in 

HeveaConnect has reduced from 71.09% to 49.91%. Accordingly, HeveaConnect ceased to be a Company’s subsidiary and it will 

be equity-accounted for as an associate.

c) 

Loan refinancing

In April 2021, the Company has secured a syndicated loan of US$270,000,000 (the “Syndicated Loan”) with an option to upsize to 

US$300,000,000. The Syndicated Loan carries a tenure of three years and the proceeds will be used to refinance an existing term 

loan of US$300,000,000 that is due in December 2021. The completion of Syndicated Loan is subject to fulfilment of, inter alia, 

the Conditions Precedent as set out in the facility agreement, which are expected to be satisfied in May 2021. 

The proforma financial effects subsequent to the drawdown of the Syndicated Loan are as follows:

Concession, which comprises 13,731 hectare of unplanted lands, to the Cameroonian government. Subsequently, the management 

of Sudcam has submitted a formal request to the Ministry of State Property, Surveys and Land Tenure of Cameroon regarding this 

matter, to which the Ministry has yet to respond.
