1. BOARD STATEMENT

In AF Global Limited’s second Sustainability Report, we have presented 

an update on our sustainability efforts for the financial year ended  

31 December 2018 (‘’FY2018”).

The Board had reviewed and determined that the material Environmental, 

Social and Governance (“ESG”) issues identified remained relevant and significant 

to our organisation and key stakeholders. In FY2018, the Board continued to 

oversee the management and monitoring of these ESG factors as part of its 

overall responsibility of directing and leading the organisation towards our mission 

of value creation and building a sustainable business.

4. INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY INTO OUR BUSINESS











4.1  Sustainability 

Management Framework

In July 2017, we established our 

sustainability reporting framework. 

We performed an analysis on 

our 

business 

and 

operation 

models to establish the basis 

for our stakeholder mapping and 

materiality assessment. Through 

our analysis, we identified five 

key stakeholder groups within our 

sustainability context and their 

respective 

material 

issues 

are 

shown in this report.

4.2  Key Stakeholders and 

Material Issues

We have a review, assessment 

and feedback process in relation 

to ESG topics. The key to this 

is a risk assessment exercise 

which entails the identification, 

assessment and documentation of 

material risks and corresponding 

internal controls. Such material 

risks include fraud and corruption, 

environmental, health and safety, 

and human capital risks. We review 

the adequacy and effectiveness 

of our risk assessment process in 

response to changing business and 

operation environment.

We 

also 

identify 

and 

review 

material issues that are most 

relevant and significant to us and 

our stakeholders. Priority is given to 

issues important to society that is 

applicable to us. We then prioritise 

our sustainability efforts and report 

issues that are most material to our 

business and stakeholders.

Corporate Social Responsibility is a key driver towards long-term sustainability which is pragmatically 

integrated into our business practices and our corporate culture.

Being in the hospitality business, we are in a privileged position to raise awareness on the importance 

of sustainability and allow our guests to participate in some of the sustainability initiatives during 

their stay with us in our hotels. We have engaged global professional hotel management companies 

reputed for their experience and approach toward sustainability so as to tap into their valuable 

knowledge to help us in implementing and integrating sustainability in our daily business practices 

and operational activities. We aim to create a culture of sustainability among our staff in every aspect 

of our hotel operations, a culture which allows us to imprint positive influence on our guests through 

their experience with us.

Significance

Environment and Future 

Generation

	Climate change

	Natural disaster

	Urbanisation, pollution etc.

Our core business is in the area of hospitality. 

Our hotels provide comfortable and conducive 

accommodation to our guests. Climate change 

such as prolonged winter or monsoon seasons 

and pollution directly affect the holiday or business-

related experience of our guests.

Our sustainability agenda for the environment and 

future generation has evolved over many years 

and is vital to our business operations as well as 

being instilled into the day-to-day work practices of 

all our staff. Our measures focus on the key goals 

of reduction of energy and water consumption, 

reduction of carbon footprint, and raising staff 

awareness of sustainable issues.

Employee

	Employee skill set

	Employee equal opportunity based 

on merit

	Non-discrimination

	Code of conduct

	Human rights

Our employees want to work in a company that 

is ethical and empathetic, where they will be 

motivated and empowered to meet their full 

potential, both professionally and personally.

Through mutual respect and equal opportunities 

based on merit, we develop a culture of goodwill 

and motivation with the employees. Such culture 

will translate into hospitality towards our hotel 

guests.

Customer

	Customer health and safety

	Terrorism

	Consumer trends

The safety and security of guests are of paramount 

importance, particularly as the hotels are located in 

major cities (e.g. London) and tourist destinations 

(e.g. Phuket) which have witnessed several 

terrorism-related activities in the recent years. Fire, 

life and safety related standards are strictly adhered 

to, in compliance with legal regulations. Such 

measures instill guest confidence in the hotels and 

the brand.

Our service and product are continuously upgraded 

in line with consumer trends, allowing the hotels to 

be competitive in their respective markets.

Supplier

	Sustainable and quality supplies

	Ethical practice of suppliers

Working closely with suppliers and channel partners 

would boost competitiveness and encourage 

sharing of sustainable practices.

Community

	Preserving culture and heritage of 

the local community

	Goodwill with local community

Our hotels maintain good relationships with our 

neighbours in the cities and areas where they 

are located. Neighbours are engaged on a regular 

basis. Much care has been taken to maintain the 

façade of the hotels to blend in with the local built 

environment.

Management team members are involved in local 

associations which promote various community 

causes. Such measures help to build the hotels’ 

reputation in the local community.

Common to All 

Stakeholder Groups

	Compliance with prevailing laws 

and regulations.

	Respect local culture, 

stakeholders and norms within 

the laws and regulations.

Legal compliance and ethical actions form the core 

of our business, and our ethos is exemplified by 

strong corporate governance, transparent reporting 

and open communication with all our stakeholder 

groups.

5. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT



We believe that good CSR practice goes hand-in-hand with good corporate management practice. 

We also recognise that it is vital that our management approaches are adaptable to the dynamics 

of business and operation environment across geographic boundaries in such a way that we can 

continuously assess our impacts, develop sustainability objectives and respond in a proper manner 

to meet expectations.

Communication and provision of appropriate feedback mechanisms which will allow us to monitor 

and evaluate performance as well as explore new possibilities is critical in sustainability reporting. 

This is managed through a CSR plan.

We continuously seek new and 

innovative ways to reduce the 

environmental 

impact 

of 

our 

products 

and 

services 

while 

maintaining 

the 

quality. 

We

5.1.2 Reduction of Carbon 

Footprint

We recognise that the effective 

management 

and 

monitoring 

of carbon footprint can reduce 

operating costs, raise brand profile, 

create a competitive edge and 

increase stakeholder value. Our 

carbon footprint is measured in 

terms of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 

emission. However, GHG emission 

is an absolute measure of how much 

carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) 

is emitted. Our GHG emission is 

predominantly indirect (Scope 2) 

emission. We have direct (Scope 1) 

emissions and we do not include 

the GHG emissions generated by 

our suppliers (Scope 3).

Considering 

the 

changes 

and 

dynamics 

of 

business 

and 

operations, we established our 

GHG emission efficiency index 

for consistent tracking of carbon 

footprint over time. To this end, we 

have set a target for GHG emission 

efficiency improvement of 10% 

from our 2017 level by 2030.

In FY2018, our GHG emission 

efficiency 

index 

stands 

at 

121,709.00 

kgCO2e 

per 

SGD 

million, which registered a 6.2% 

improvement 

as 

compared 

to 

the 

financial 

year 

ended 

31 December 2017 (‘’FY2017’). 

We will continue to monitor our 

performance against our set target.

5.1.3 Reduction of Paper 

Consumption

Our 

employees 

are 

urged 

to 

minimise paper wastage at work by 

adhering to our internal guidelines. 

For example, double-sided printing 

is set as a default, lower grammage 

paper is used for daily printing, 

and blank sides of unneeded 

single-sided copies are used for 

printing drafts. A green message 

to consider the environment before 

printing is always included in the 

email signatures of our employees. 

Paper re-use and recycling habits 

are 

also 

cultivated 

through 

initiatives such as our in-house 

reminders posted near the copy 

machines.

We have embarked on a digital 

document management system 

with an aim to improve operational 

efficiency, security and reduce 

paper consumption. We hope to 

eventually evolve into a paperless 

working environment.

Considering 

the 

changes 

and 

dynamics 

of 

business 

and 

operations, 

we 

established 

our 

paper 

consumption 

index 

for consistent tracking of paper 

consumption over time. To this end, 

we have set a target for a reduction 

in paper consumption of 10% from 

our 2017 level by 2030.

In FY2018, we consumed a total 

of 8,786.69 kg of paper, 100% 

of which are Forest Stewardship 

Council (FSC) certified. The paper 

consumption 

index 

stands 

at 

179.75 kg per SGD million which 

is 12.4% higher than our base year 

2017.

Higher paper consumption was 

mainly due to more events and 

meetings being organised during 

the year.

We will continue to monitor our 

paper 

consumption 

and 

work 

towards our 2030 goal.

5.1.4 Promoting Green Practices

Our operations in various locations 

are in the various stage of their 

journey in the implementation of 

green solutions suitable for their 

respective operating environments. 

Green 

solutions 

are 

initiatives 

that our hotels can implement 

to 

progressively 

improve 

their 

operation practices toward their 

respective sustainability goals. Each 

green solution lays out the steps that 

the hotel must take to implement 

the 

solution. 

Such 

initiatives 

are to be implemented through 

areas such as design, operational 

procedures and adaptation of green 

technologies to achieve objectives 

such as reducing energy, water and 

waste, cutting carbon emissions, 

improving guest health and comfort 

as well as reducing operating and 

maintenance costs.

Examples of green solutions range 

from using energy-efficient lighting 

and lighting controls, installing 

water-efficient bathroom fixtures 

to using energy efficient appliances 

or any other alternative energy 

sourcing.

5.1.5 Hotel Sustainability 

Initiatives

Our 

hotels 

proactively 

track 

sustainability indicators as a core 

part of our hotel management 

practices. Some key indicators are 

shown in section 6.3.

5.2  Caring for Our Employees

5.2.1 Our Approach

Our 

people 

are 

our 

valuable 

resource and investing in their 

professional development is vital 

to our business sustainability. Our 

goal is to establish work ethics 

among our employees, which are in 

line with our core values and code 

of conduct.

We recognise that a motivated 

workforce will convey a positive 

message to all our key stakeholders. 

By  attracting, nurturing, empowering 

and rewarding our employees, we 

create an environment conducive for 

innovation and inspiration which will 

boost our competitiveness.

Our 

business 

operates 

in 

an 

environment with diverse races, 

cultures and geographic locations. 

With this in mind, our Human 

Resource (HR) polices take into 

consideration the prevailing laws 

and regulations as well as local 

culture, norms and sensitivity.

5.2.2 Employment Practices

Our HR management principles 

and policies have been developed 

and established based on fair 

employment practices with the 

goal of attracting, developing and 

retaining a robust and motivated 

workforce. Our HR policies cover 

key areas such as remuneration, 

benefits, 

and 

training. 

Our 

performance-based reward scheme 

provides guidance and motivation 

to our employees to perform to 

their potential in alignment with the 

objectives of the Group.

5.2.2.1 Communication

As we grow, effective and regular 

communication 

across 

the 

organisation is crucial to ensure 

continuous alignment of objectives 

between the employees and the 

organisation. We achieve this through 

our various communication sessions 

customised based on the target 

employees. Communication sessions 

for our managers are held on a 

regular basis. The agendas covered 

at these sessions are customised as 

appropriate to the target functional 

scope of the managers.

5.2.2.2 Employee Feedback

We value our employees’ expertise 

in their areas of responsibilities. 

Therefore, 

their 

feedback 

is 

important in the improvement of 

overall management and operations 

of the organisation. Through various 

established processes of employee 

engagement, such as employee 

objective 

setting, 

performance 

review as well as exit interviews in 

events of resignations, we gather 

valuable feedbacks for continuous 

improvements to the organisation.

In 

addition, 

there 

are 

other 

feedback 

channels 

for 

areas 

specific to business and function, 

such as the whistle-blowing policy 

on control and compliance issues. 

This policy allows staff to raise 

their concerns in confidence about 

possible improprieties in matters of 

financial reporting or other matters. 

We 

also 

accept 

anonymous 

reports to ensure that independent 

investigations of such matters are 

carried out and that appropriate 

follow-up action is taken.

5.2.2.3 Career Development and 

Training

We recognise that education and 

training is essential in maintaining a 

competitive workforce. Employee 

career development and performance 

management are established based 

on merit and contribution.

Training programmes cover a variety

5. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

In addition to the human resources 

we manage, we also engage 

external 

contracted 

companies 

as our outsourced vendors to 

provide personnel, who might work 

within our premises. Although 

we supervise these individuals, 

they are employed by contracted 

companies and are not included in 

our head count. We do not employ 

other 

types 

of 

un-contracted 

workers.

We expect that the contracted 

companies we work with will 

share our core principles of HR 

management practices. In the 

event that this expectation is 

compromised, we will evaluate if 

we will continue to engage them.

5.2.4 Employee Benefits

Employees 

are 

provided 

basic 

employment terms and working 

conditions 

including 

contract 

requirements, remuneration, hours 

of work, overtime, rest days and 

annual leave entitlement. In addition, 

we provide beyond-compliance-level 

benefits to our full-time employees.

5.2.4.1 Retirement and Healthcare

Our 

Group 

has 

presence 

in 

various 

geographic 

locations 

where there are various local laws 

and regulations on pension and 

healthcare for employees. Our HR 

management practices comply with 

applicable laws and regulations in 

the countries where we operate in.

5.2.5 Safety and Health in the 

Workplace

We are committed to workplace 

safety 

and 

health 

and 

take 

precautions to prevent occupational 

injuries among employees. We 

believe that safe work conditions 

will boost morale.

5.2.6 Individual Rights

Protecting basic human rights is 

fundamental to all our operations. 

Labour rights, the prohibition of 

discrimination 

and 

harassment, 

protection of privacy, prohibition 

of forced and child labour, and 

workplace 

health 

and 

safety 

are observed within the work 

environment. Discrimination and 

harassment are not tolerated.

We also respect our employees’ 

rights to freedom of association 

as well as their membership with 

trade unions and other professional 

bodies.

In FY2018, some of our workforce 

was 

covered 

by 

a 

collective 

bargaining agreement; no incidents 

of forced labour, child labour or 

young workers were identified 

across the organisation, and no 

human rights-related grievances 

have been reported.

5.3  Focusing on Our Customers’ Needs

5.3.1 Our Approach

Safety within our hotel premises 

have always been our key priority.

Open and frequent communication 

and 

responsive 

feedback 

are 

ingrained into our daily activities 

with 

customer 

interaction. 

In 

addition to striving for excellence 

in our product, service and support, 

we attach importance to data 

privacy. We have processes and 

controls in place over confidential 

and sensitive data related to our 

customers.

5.3.2 Health and Safety

Providing 

an 

accommodating 

atmosphere 

that 

does 

not 

compromise safety is the biggest 

challenge that hotels face. Achieving 

these goals require a multifaceted 

plan that starts with staff training 

and guest education about safety 

and security issues. Our hotel 

management consistently enforce 

established 

security 

policies, 

such as allowing only registered 

guests on hotel property. Constant 

planning to stay ahead of these 

issues is also a must, especially 

when the hotel hosts public events.

5.3.2.1 Access Control

Controlling access is an important 

part of hotel security planning to 

prevent criminal activities such 

as theft from guest rooms. Our 

contractors and staff are trained 

in controlling room key distribution 

and restricting access to registered 

guests only. Security personnel are 

stationed at all main access points 

to greet people, while deterring 

anyone with no business from 

entering the property, especially 

disruptive or intoxicated non-guests.

5.3.2.2 Guests Education

Hotel employees have a responsibility 

to educate guests on safety and 

security 

responsibilities. 

The 

challenge for staff is to get the 

message across without negatively 

affecting the customer’s experience. 

For instance, the bellman can gently 

remind 

guests 

the 

importance 

of locking room doors to prevent 

theft when delivering luggage to 

guests’ rooms. Front desk staff can 

also subtly discourage guests from 

actions that leave them vulnerable to 

crime, such as flashing their room key 

cards with room numbers. Our staff 

are trained to manage such delicate 

situations in a professional manner to 

ensure the safety of our guests.

5.3.2.3 Public Areas Patrol

Technology has come a long way 

in helping hotels upgrade basic 

security measures. Closed-circuit 

TV cameras with recording systems 

are essential for securing such 

busy public spaces such as bars, 

lounges, parking lots, and loading 

bays. However, these areas also 

allow open access to disruptive 

persons, muggers and pickpockets. 

Monitoring of the camera images 

by staff and proper lighting reduces 

the chances for such crimes.

5.3.2.4 Staff Training

Hotel guests can participate in 

relevant safety programmes carried 

out by the hotels. Our hotel staff 

are trained with the objective of 

ensuring a consistent, professional 

response to emergencies. Our 

staff are empowered to take 

responsibility in addressing unusual 

behaviour that occurs on hotel 

property, without jeopardising their 

own safety.

5.3.3 Data Safety and Privacy

Ensuring safety and privacy of our 

customers’ data is our priority. We 

handle and communicate sensitive 

and confidential information of 

our customers such as guest 

registration, home addresses and 

credit card information with due 

care to ensure our customers’ data 

are managed in accordance to the 

level of confidentiality. We observe 

local laws and internal regulations 

applicable to personal information 

protection.

5.4  Partnering Our Suppliers

5.4.1 Our Approach

Our supply chain activities can be 

split into two broad categories: 

corporate supply chains and hotel 

supply chains. Our corporate supply 

chains cover procurement for our 

corporate offices. At the hotel level, 

supply chains cover procurement 

for items required for running 

a hotel and cover a wide range 

of items including food, linens, 

cleaning supplies and furniture. 

We believe that building strong 

relationships with our suppliers is 

essential in achieving sustainable 

business practices throughout our 

supply chains. We recognise that 

we are only at the beginning of this 

process and have to be pragmatic 

in terms of communication and 

expectation of our key suppliers.

5.4.2 Supplier Selection

Our key suppliers are selected 

through 

our 

supplier 

selection 

process. When selecting our key 

suppliers, we examine criteria 

such as financial health, quality 

of products and services and 

competitiveness of pricing. Our final 

decision on supplier selection will 

be based on the overall assessment 

which takes a balanced view across 

all selection criteria.

5.4.3 Supplier Review

We review the performance of 

our key suppliers to determine 

whether to extend our partnership 

with them. Such review process 

allow us to evaluate and ensure 

that our key suppliers’ services and 

products aligns to our business 

requirements 

and 

sustainability 

objectives.

Launch of The Grenfell Garden

5.5  Supporting Our Community

5.5.1 Our Approach

We believe in giving back to the 

communities 

we 

conduct 

our 

business in. Over the years, we 

have been providing support to 

local schools, families with financial 

difficulties and disaster relief efforts. 

To this end, our engagement 

programmes encompass financial 

and practical support to carefully 

selected beneficiaries, such as 

fundraising and voluntary activities 

like 

donations 

of 

cash 

and 

necessities.

These continuous out-reach efforts 

have fostered goodwill, improved 

relations and communication, and 

On 12 September 2018, Crowne Plaza 

London Kensington has dedicated a 

section of our landscaped garden in 

loving memory of residents of The 

Grenfell Tower who tragically passed 

on the 14 June 2017. 

The Grenfell Garden was located 

in a secluded corner of the hotel, a 

tranquil oasis in Kensington. Arrays of 

72 poppies and daffodils have been 

planted to commemorate those we 

lost in the tragedy.

The Grenfell Garden was officially 

launched by the General Manager of 

Crowne Plaza London Kensington, 

Mr Edward Bracken.

Through collaboration with the 

West London Hotels Association, 

a charitable event was organised  

that raised a sum of £102,915. 

£96,415 of the collected amount 

was 

donated 

to 

the 

Grenfell 

United Foundation and £6,500 was 

donated to the Kensington and 

Chelsea Foundation.

peaceful local environment.

they align with our own community 

engagement goals, the anticipated 

staff participation rate, and the 

tangible impact on the beneficiary.
