STATEMENT
FROM
OUR
BOARD
F J Benjamin Holdings Ltd ("F J Benjamin" or the "Company", and together with its subsidiaries, the
"Group") is proud to present our Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 30 June ("FY"2021.
This report is focused on the Group's strategic efforts and continued commitment to Environmental, Social
and Governance ("ESG") factors to provide sustainable returns to our stakeholders.
The Board of Directors (the "Board") and senior management (the "Management") remain committed to
establish and maintain an effective sustainability management framework,which is supported by underly
ing internal controls,risk management practices,and clear accountability and reporting processes.The
Board evaluates and considers ESG risks and opportunities relevant to the Group during the formulation of
overall business strategy, objectives and performance measurements.
Despite the initiatives and cost containment measures the Group has put in place,COVID-19 related
circumstances continue to impact and disrupt the Group's operations this year. New social norms and safe
management measures imposed by the Governments in the territories the Group operates in to curb the
spread of COVID-19 virus in the community has reduced human footfall at shopping malls, and the fashion
industry, being highly discretionary in nature, has seen more controlled consumer spending.
However, the Group has adapted rapidly by pivoting its business model and accelerating digitalisation
trends to fulfill sales through online platforms. To ensure the continued sustainability of our business,
health and safety measures for our customers and employees were made paramount. Safety protocols
were put in place for the Group's operations and workplace complying with the regulations imposed by the
Government
Since the inception of our Sustainability Report in FY2018, the Group has remained determined to manage
ESG factors that are material to the sustainability of our business. With the Government's commitment to
the Singapore Green Plan 2030, the Group intends to refine our current strategies, incorporate new
technological developments,where possible,and to adopt more environmental business practices such as
reduce, reuse and recycle the usage of energy, water, plastic and paper in our workplace.
We would like to thank all our stakeholders for the continuous support to the Group over the years. We
also appreciate the efforts of our employees who have worked tirelessly over the past year to cope with
the challenges posed by the pandemic. We will endeavour to work smart and continue to incorporate
sustainability initiatives in our business processes

TRAINING AND EDUCATION
The onset of the pandemic has continued to severely impact training plans foi
FY2021.As the core mode of delivery of the training sessions involved
face-to-face and role-playing arrangements,many training programs were
cancelled in compliance of the strict safe management measures issued by
the authority.Alternative approaches have been adopted such as online
training courses, but with limitations in the medium usage (e.g. access to
laptops and small sized classes)that has posed further difficulties for some
frontline staff to attend
In spite of these challenges,we managed to extend training to some
employees covering service-centric topics,product knowledge and work
professionalism. Emphasis was placed on on-the-job training that encourage
productivity and efficiency through targeted and relevant learning content
As F J Benjamin emerges from these challenging times,we aim to maintain
our commitment towards our employees by providing access to training in
accordance with our material targets,so as to equip our employees with the
correct skillsets and knowledge whilst performing their work
responsibilities effectively

WORKPLACE SAEETY AND HEALTH

fices to safeguard the well-being of our employees that are returning to work. In FY2021,the Group

MENTAL HEALTH
The coVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic recession have negatively affected many
people's mental health. Coping with changes in working arrangements and living with a prolonged
restrictions on social and family congregation requires adaption by employees. The Group recognises
these factors and has taken measures to address these concerns amongst our employees. On a
monthly basis,the Head of Departments conduct casual check-in sessions with members of their team
virtually, accompanied with some treats purchased through food delivery services to foster
cohesiveness.
In the in-house magazine publication, selected employees who have been separated from their
immediate families due to the COVID-19 travel restrictions have come forward to share their methods
for coping with the situation as well as to offer words of encouragement to any employee that may be
facing similar circumstances.
Through these sharing sessions, the Group is better able to implement and allow flexibility for
employees to work in a way that does not strain their physical and mental well-being

ENERGY EMISSION AND GHG EMISSIONS
F J Benjamin continues to recognise the importance of managing our operational energy use
We understand that our actions have a direct impact on environmental issues such as climate
change.As such,we take all feasible steps to ensure that energy is not wasted in the course
of our business.
At F J Benjamin,our primary environmental footprint stems from electricity used from lighting
and air-conditioning to run our retail stores, warehouses and offices. In addition to updating
our infrastructure, we recognise the importance of inculcating an environmentally-conscious
attitude in our employees.
Consequently,F J Benjamin has implemented several initiatives - switching off office lights
during lunch period and when not in use after office hours,placing reminders in our stores to
remind our employees to be more mindful about energy consumption, and harnessing
technology at our offices to reduce the frequency of travel-to reduce the energy use by
our employees.
Replacing lighting with energy saving bulbs
and LED on displays and ceilings
Internal monitoring of electrical usage by
switching off lights and air-conditioning at
unoccuppied area in office or during lunch
Encourage the use of digital meeting methods
where possible to minimise the need to travel.

PERFORMANCE
In FY2021,the Group used a total of 2,157,840.59 KWh of energy which produced
1,290,789 Kg CO,in scope 2 emissions.This was a 14% decrease in energy use compared
to the previous reporting period.This decrease was primarily attributed to the temporary
closure of our stores in Singapore and Malaysia in line with the regulations set by the
government during the year to curb the spread of COVID-19.This decrease also led to a
decrease in energy and emission intensities with the overall floor area having little change
compared to the previous reporting period.

APPENDIX
This section explains the calculation boundaries,methodologies and
assumptions used in the computation of F J Benjamin's energy and
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Reporting Scope and Period
F J Benjamin adopts the Operational Control Approach, as outlined in the
GHG Protocol Corporate Standard,and is used to determine organisational
boundaries.This attributes accountability for 100% of the GHG emissions
from operations over which the organisation has control.
Data for energy and GHG emissions consumption from the following
reporting periods have been included in the Sustainability Report FY2021:
FY2020:1 July 2019 to30 June2020
. FY202 1: 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021
Energy and Carbon Intensity
Electricity consumption covers usage at our offices, warehouses and stores
in Singapore and Malaysia. Intensity metrics are calculated relative to
effective Gross Floor Area (GFA), expressed as kWh/sq m.
GHG emissions
Scope 2 emissions are calculated from the consumption of grid electricity
in Singapore and Malaysia, expressed in tonnes of cO,
Emission Factors
Scope 2: Emission factors for the calculation of electricity consumption are
taken from the Energy Market Authority (EMA) for Singapore (0.4080 kg
CO,/KWh) and the Institute of Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) for
Malaysia (0.6448 kg CO,/KWh).
