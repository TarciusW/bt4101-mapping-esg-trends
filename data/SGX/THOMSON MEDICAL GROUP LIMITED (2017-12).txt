OUR APPROACH

Our commitment to sustainability is part of our strategy to foster innovation and create long-term value for 

our stakeholders. We have embarked on a journey to identify and address the key sustainability aspects 

of our business activities.  

A Sustainability Coordinating Committee comprising representatives from the key functions was set up to 

identify the material ESG factors of the design and engineering business, and to gather and monitor the 

performance data and metrics. To strengthen our sustainability governance, we are putting in place a data 

management system to track performance metrics in relation to our key sustainability indicators and targets. 

Our Board of Directors considers sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation and has determined 

the key material issues relating to the Group’s environmental, social and governance impacts. The Board oversees 

the management of these material issues and has ultimate responsibility for the Sustainability Report, 

including its compliance with the SGX-ST guidelines on corporate governance and sustainability reporting. 

Materiality

A materiality assessment exercise was done to determine significant sustainability impacts from our business 

activities and their relevance to our business strategy, business model and key stakeholders. A list of 

potential issues was identified through reviews with management and engagement with key stakeholders. 

 

The Sustainability Coordinating Committee then prioritised the economic, environmental, social and governance 

issues that were deemed highly relevant for the business and its internal and external stakeholders. 

Risks and opportunities were considered in identifying these material issues. With strategic input and guidance 

provided by the Board of Directors, five material issues were identified to be of highest priority to the Company’s 

sustainability risks and opportunities. The Board is satisfied with the relevance of the selected issues to 

its business strategy and performance. The five key material issues are: 

Financial Performance

Corporate Governance &amp; Compliance

Product &amp; Service Quality 

Environment Impact 

Community Engagement

Sustainability Report 2017

Stakeholder Engagement

Interaction with our stakeholders is important for the relevance of the material ESG factors across the value chain 

from the design to construction of our projects. Regular engagement with stakeholders also provides an updated 

perspective of the sustainability aspects of our business.

In support of the national agenda to increase productivity and innovation, RSP has been driving transformation in 

the build sector by being an early adopter of Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA) – with a focus on 

Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (PPVC). With the bulk of the installation moved off-site to 

a controlled environment, on-site safety is improved and noise and dust pollution typically associated 

with traditional construction is greatly reduced.  

PPVC also significantly reduces installation time, improving overall productivity in terms of manpower, time 

and cost savings. PPVC is a means to reduce the quantity of on-site construction waste and minimise harm 

to the environment. This method of construction has been applied for Crowne Plaza Changi Airport hotel 

extension which is the first private commercial project in Singapore to use PPVC. With the PPVC method, 

the project achieved around 40% savings in manpower. The project received the BCA Construction 

Productivity Award (Platinum) in 2017.  



We have also been a pioneer adopter of Building Information Modelling (BIM) since 2010 and have a team of 

BIM professionals and experts who provide strong technical expertise for many projects. BIM allows us and our 

clients to more effectively visualise the architecture and engineering designs and identify and resolve any 

constraints during the early design stages. We have used BIM for various projects such as Jewel Changi Airport 

and CapitaGreen, in collaboration with external consultants and contractors, overseen by our team of BIM 

experts who are dedicated to implementing BIM best practices throughout a project’s lifespan. Working in a fully 

collaborative BIM environment enables us to create well-coordinated and integrated designs of any scale 

and complexity.

Embracing Building Technologies  

Case Study: Changi Airport Terminal 4

As the Civil &amp; Structural engineering consultant for Changi Airport Terminal 4, RSP received the BCA Design 

and Engineering Safety Excellence Award 2018 for the ingenious design and engineering processes 

and solutions for the project. The award recognises the efforts of RSP and the project team for overcoming 

project challenges and achieving the highest standards of design and engineering for safety excellence. 

This is the sixth consecutive year RSP has received the BCA Design and Engineering Safety Excellence 

Award. 

For Terminal 4, RSP faced the challenge of having to complete the main terminal building in 30 months, 

and complete part of the first and second storeys within 12 months to allow subcontractors to start 

their works to meet the project’s deadline. Construction productivity was key for the timely completion 

of the project and the team had most of Terminal 4’s structure prefabricated offsite, then transported 

and assembled onsite. The adoption of a full precast system approach for the second storey of the 

terminal building reduced the construction time required by 64% compared to conventional in-situ 

method.   

RSP also worked closely with the contractors to implement a unique “Hat First” construction method for 

the terminal building. The roof was completed ahead of the floors below from the middle out. This provided 

a safe and conducive working environment for early commencement of finishing and services works as well 

as early installation of the airport’s Baggage Handling System. Another engineering feat was the use of long 

steel roof trusses to support the roof of T4’s departure hall to achieve a visually appealing, column-free 

hall. 

Complete adoption of BIM for the project allowed design solutions to be better assessed and construction 

risks to be identified before commencement of site works. This maximised site productivity and safety 

by minimising abortive works on site.

Clients Satisfaction  

To assess our clients’ satisfaction and continually strive for quality service, we gather feedback from our clients, 

consultants and contractors through feedback forms issued when key milestones such as regulatory approvals 

and Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) are attained. Clients assessed the project team on factors such as 

innovativeness, cost effectiveness, timeliness, quality control and technical expertise.   

In 2017, our architecture business achieved an average score of 4.3 over a maximum score of five from clients, 

contractors and consultants. We target to achieve a yearly increment of 2% over our satisfaction scores 

from these stakeholders.  

To assess the performance of the contractors we work with and to maintain the standards of the developments 

we work on, we also gather feedback from the architects and engineers about the contractors and vendors

we work with. Issued when a project has been completed, the feedback report is intended as a 

channel for promoting shared experiences and knowledge to benefit others within the organisation. 

The contractors are assessed on a range of criteria such as the quality of materials and equipment used, 

workmanship, safety standards, prevention of public inconvenience and more.

ENVIRONMENT

A major focus of the Company is on developing environmentally sustainable design and engineering solutions. 

17 certified Green Mark Managers within the Company provide expertise on designing energy efficient and 

sustainable buildings. This group of Green Mark Managers constantly identify and develop integrated solutions in the 

following areas: 

• 

Efficient energy, water and resource use, with responsible considerations for renewable over non-renewable 

 

sources 

• 

Reduction and elimination of waste and harmful emissions

• 

Sustainable, reusable and recyclable materials and techniques

• 

Optimal daylighting, clean air and enhancement of health, comfort and productivity

• 

Minimisation of health and safety risks

We always strive to be at the forefront of new building design and engineering techniques and applications of 

sustainable features. An example is the creation of the first rooftop solar garden in Singapore for Woh Hup 

Building which won the BCA Green Mark Award (Platinum) in 2017. As the architecture, civil &amp; structural 

and mechanical &amp; electrical engineering consultant for Woh Hup Building, we have designed energy efficient 

air-conditioning, lighting and water efficient fittings for the office building. An advanced energy management 

system monitors the building’s energy and water consumption, solar and rainwater harvesting.  

Grand Park City Hall, where RSP is architecture and civil &amp; structural engineering consultant, is another 

project which won the BCA Green Mark Award (Platinum) in 2017. To offer the most optimum solution to 

achieve an efficient building, the hotel includes features such as energy efficient lightings, water fittings, 

photovoltaic cells to harness solar energy and rainwater harvesting for irrigation. Our target is to achieve 

three or more Green Mark Platinum Awards per year on average over a three-year period.

ENVIRONMENT

Based on the BCA Building Energy Benchmarking Report 2017, our EUI is within the top quartile 

performance of the EUI benchmark for office buildings in both 2016 and 2017. According to the National 

Building Energy Benchmark, average EUI for office buildings in Singapore is 261 kWh/sq m per year. We target 

a 2% reduction in electricity consumption and paper usage per year.   

To reduce our environmental impact and contribute towards a sustainable environment, we have implemented 

energy and water conservation measures and practices in our Singapore offices. We reduce electricity consumption 

by using energy-efficient lightings and setting machines on default standby mode or turned off when not in use. 

 

We reduce paper usage by minimising printing and setting printers and photocopiers to duplex printing by default. 

Green Label certified products, paper from sustainably managed forests, recycled and refillable products are used. 

Regular waste paper collection for recycling are scheduled and recycling bins are conveniently located within 

the office building. We have also started to adopt electronic transmission for the Annual Report 2017 and

reduced substantially the copies of the report we printed.  

We held an electronic waste (e-waste) recycling drive in March 2017 for staff looking to dispose unwanted 

electrical and electronic equipment. Items such as cables, wires, CDs, modems, headphones and light bulbs, 

were collected before being transported to a collection centre to be emptied into e-waste recycling bins for 

proper disposal or recycling. The e-waste collection drive is aimed at motivating staff on nurturing a green 

company culture. According to the National Environment Agency, Singaporeans churn out 60 million kg of 

e-waste every year, of which only a fraction is disposed properly or recycled. With the amount of e-waste 

growing continuously, we are committed to play our part by taking action to combat the e-waste problem. 

We honour our commitment to the overall goals of tackling climate change, enabling sustainable growth and 

developing environmental stewardship. In support of the Singapore Green Building Week 2017, we co-sponsored 

a tree-planting event held on August 2017 at Kranji Marshes. Staff helped plant 50 trees as a show 

of support for the preservation of local ecosystems and biodiversity. Organised by BCA, the tree-planting event 

was a key activity of the International Green Building Conference 2017, which aims to promote greening 

efforts and reduce carbon footprint of the built industry. 

 

RSP is a member of the Singapore Green Building Council (SGBC), which enables us to share and learn about new 

industry research and trends and assimilate the best green building practices. As a member of SGBC, 

we contribute to SGBC’s vision of fostering innovative industry solutions across the building and construction 

value chain, and upholding high standards and benchmarks for green building solutions to build more 

sustainable cities for better living.

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT

As an active corporate citizen, we seek opportunities where we can positively impact communities through 

meaningful charitable and social initiatives. To raise funds for the less privileged and disadvantaged, we have 

donated to charities such as Community Chest and Assisi Hospice. In 2017, we donated over $60,000 to charitable 

causes and accumulated over 110 hours of volunteer service. Here are some of our community engagement 

activities in 2017.  

In November 2017, we volunteered with charity organisation Willing Hearts in preparing, cooking and distributing 

about 5,000 meals to over 40 locations islandwide. Beneficiaries include the elderly, the disabled, low income 

families, children from single parent families or otherwise poverty stricken families, and migrant workers 

in Singapore.  

“United @ Home” football clinic with Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs

Together with our UK partners and football legends, Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs, we co-organised a community 

outreach event - “United @ Home” - which aims to reach out to youths and provide them with opportunities 

to learn values such as teamwork, commitment and discipline through football. The football clinic which was 

organised with Home United, and supported by the Singapore Land Authority and Teens Network Club @ 

MacPherson, 

saw 

the

the youths. Over 40 youth footballers who were aged between 11 and 15 from different organisations 

in the MacPherson area, including the Teens Network Club @MacPherson, MacPherson Primary School, 

Darul Ihsan Orphanage, Salim Mattar Mosque and Ramakrishna Mission Singapore participated in the 

April event. 

We also support the nurturing of talents in the built environment sector through career guidance workshops 

and scholarships. In 2017, we awarded three BCA-Industry Built Environment Scholarships to outstanding 

students pursuing full-time built environment courses. We have been a loyal sponsor of this programme 

since 2009. Through these programme, graduates will enjoy opportunities to build on an exciting and 

rewarding career in the built environment sector.
