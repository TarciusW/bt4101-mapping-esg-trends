1 BOARD STATEMENT 

It gives us great pleasure to present our Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 30 June 

2020 ("FY2020”). In our Third Sustainability Report, we will be highlighting the progress and 

achievements of our organisation over the previous 12 months, with particular focus on our 

commitment to working alongside our valued stakeholders to build a sustainable business based on 

our resilience, adaptability and innovation.  

It is our belief that building a sustainable business is vital to our continued success and that we must 

be fully accountable for the impacts on our environment, customers, people, community as well as 

our financial performance.  

The delivery of sustainable results is a critical aspect of our ability to remain strong and financially 

stable. Acknowledging this, will help focus our commitment to principles laid out in our Corporate 

Sustainability Policy. Our responsibility to society is to ensure that sustainable practices are 

incorporated into every link of our value chain. We must meet the needs not only of our customers, 

employees and the community we operate in, but also those of our environment and our future 

generations.  

This report provides details on how we have met our responsibilities with our key stakeholders in 

FY2020.

2 ABOUT THE REPORT 

This sustainability report articulates our commitment to sustainability and transparency. This is our 

Third sustainability report. The report is designed to provide a transparent and balanced view of TEHO 

International Inc Ltd. (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”), to reflect the interests of our 

key stakeholders, and to address those interests pragmatically. This report aims to include 

comprehensive and accessible information on the Company’s strategy towards sustainability, key 

issues as well as data according to recognized standards.  

2.1 Report Scope 

The report covers the performance of our consolidated entities for FY2020. The content of this report 

will focus on the sustainability performance, activities and initiatives that are under our direct control, 

including our Singapore offices and operations, our local supply chain as well as any overseas activities 

directly associated with us. This report excludes joint ventures which are not directly under our control. 

Material issues and topics described in this report have been selected according to their level of 

significance within the Company boundaries, the sustainability context and the expectations of 

stakeholders which are reflective of our core business in a consistent manner for comparability of our 

performance indicators across time. In this respect, this report covers our Marine &amp; Offshore Segment 

in our material operational boundaries in Singapore. All material aspects disclosed in this report are 

relevant to activities in Singapore only. The scope of this report covers operations and initiatives within 

Singapore, where the Group is based. Nevertheless, our corporate governance and sustainability 

approaches are drawn from the policies and practices set at Group level. 

This sustainability report focuses on the Group’s sustainability strategies and practices whilst 

highlighting the economic, environmental, social and governance aspects of our activities and 

developments. The report aims to provide an overview of our approach, priorities and targets, as well 

as a performance review for our key sustainability areas.  

2.2 Report Methodology 

This report has been prepared in compliance with the requirements of Rules 711A and 711B of the 

Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (the 

“SGX-ST”) (the “Catalist Rules”) as well as in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) 

Standards: Core option. We have chosen the GRI Standards reporting guidelines for its robust guidance 

which offers an international reference for the disclosure of governance approach and of the 

environmental, social and economic performance and impacts of organisations. This report has also 

taken into consideration the primary components of the report content as set out by the SGX-ST 

“Comply or Explain” requirements for sustainability reporting. Our data are reported in good faith and 

to the best of our knowledge. We will continue to improve our data collection processes.  

We did not seek external assurance for this report. 

2.3 Report Structure 

This Sustainability Report is structured to reflect the interests of our key stakeholders. We have 

identified five (5) key stakeholder groups, namely, the future generations, employees, customers, 

suppliers and communities. For each stakeholder group, we lay out our management approaches that 

govern how our material issues are identified as well as how the issues are prioritized and managed. 

Further, we will present our initiatives relating to sustainability in the areas of environmental, social 

and economic issues relevant to our aspects and boundaries. Finally, we will provide the information 

of our key performance indicators, performance targets and outcomes.

3 CORPORATE PROFILE 

3.1 Vision and Mission 

Our vision is to be a leading and trusted key supplier for the marine &amp; offshore and oil &amp; gas industries. 

Our mission is to build a company that is recognised internationally as a dependable key supplier and 

servicing different customers in various major ports of the world. 

3.2 Governance 

Our Board of Directors (“the Board”) oversees all corporate governance and operational matters 

relating to our business. For corporate sustainability, the Board is supported by the Corporate 

Sustainability Committee (“CSC”) which includes designated senior executives and is chaired by our 

Executive Chairman and Group Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). CSC provides leadership and approval 

over corporate sustainability matters such as Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) plan, community 

investment and environmental initiatives. Supported by CSC, our Corporate Sustainability Champion 

(the “Champion”) is our Subject Matter Expert (“SME”) in the area of corporate sustainability. It pro-

actively raises awareness through education and training across the organisation. Further, through 

the Corporate Sustainability Work Group (“CSWG”), our Champion will identify the Group’s 

Environment, Social and Governance (“ESG”) factors, before engaging stakeholders, businesses and 

functions to execute the Group’s sustainability plan. Businesses and functions provide back-to-back 

assurance over the quality of information used for sustainability reporting.

3.3 Ethics and Compliance 

Being a listed Company in the SGX-ST, we are committed to maintaining a high standard of corporate 

governance, to ensure greater transparency and to protect the interests of the Company’s 

shareholders. Our corporate governance framework covers ethics and compliance through a Code of 

Conduct as well as action guidelines which are to be adhered by officers and employees across the 

organisation. TEHO has in place a whistle blowing policy, which establishes the procedures for 

reporting in good faith, any improper conduct while protecting the whistle-blower from reprisals. In 

addition, the Employee Code of Conduct, found in the Employee Handbook, sets out expectations of 

employees in relation to issues such as fraud or bribery. Our employees are required to adhere to the 

Employee Code of Conduct and maintain high levels of integrity. Internal Auditors monitor for risk of 

corruption and report any findings to the Audit Committee, without the presence of management as 

a means of monitoring TEHO’s policies and performance internally.

4 INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY INTO OUR BUSINESS 

We believe CSR is a key driver towards long-term sustainability. Such responsibility is pragmatically 

integrated into our business practices as one of the core values in our corporate culture. Embedding 

such responsibility into our management processes across the value chain allows us to establish 

credibility among our stakeholders. Through our action today, we play a part in influencing the 

environment for our future generations. Through integrating the notion of sustainability in our 

business, we ensure that our business strategy and operations are in line with a long-term vision 

towards a conducive and sustainability future. 

Despite escalating global trade tensions in a slowing economy, we remain steadfast in growing our 

core business. We expect greater challenges in the upcoming years and will strive to remain 

committed to seeking high-value and high-performance product offerings to sustain our competitive 

edge. 

4.1 Sustainability Management Framework 

In July 2017, we took the initiative to establish our sustainability reporting framework. We performed 

an analysis on our business and operation models as the basis for our stakeholder mapping and 

materiality assessment. Through our analysis, we identified five (5) key stakeholder groups within our 

sustainability context and their respective material issues are to be shown in this report. 

4.2 Key Stakeholders and Material Issues 

We have a regular review, assessment and feedback process in relation to ESG topics. Key to this is 

our regular Enterprise Risk Management exercise which entails the identification, assessment and 

documentation of material risks and corresponding internal controls. Such material risks include fraud 

and corruption, environmental, health and safety, and human capital risks which are ESG-relevant. 

We are continuously improving the adequacy and effectiveness of our Risk Assessment and Control 

Self-Assessment processes in response to changing business and operation environment. 

Through regular stakeholder engagement, we identify and review material issues that are most 

relevant and significant to us and our stakeholders. For external stakeholders, priority is given to issues 

important to society and applicable to us. Then, we prioritize our sustainability efforts and report 

issues that are most material to its business and stakeholders. Considering that specific stakeholders 

and material issues are specific in countries and locations, we are reporting the stakeholder 

engagement and material issues for our Singapore operations in this report.

4.3 Alignment with International Initiatives 

4.3.1 

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 

Established in 1945 under the Charter of the United Nations (the “UN”), the General Assembly 

occupies a central position as the chief deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the UN. 

Comprising all 193 Members of the UN, it provides a unique forum for multilateral discussion of the 

full spectrum of international issues covered by the Charter. It also plays a significant role in the 

process of standard-setting and the codification of international law. 

On 25 September 2015, the UN General Assembly adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals 

(“SDGs”) to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable 

development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to be achieved over the next 15 years. Although 

the SDGs are primarily aimed at governments, they represent an important opportunity for businesses 

to also act for a more sustainable world. We will use SDGs as one of the guiding principles for our 

sustainability initiatives. 


 

 

Sustainability Report

We acknowledge that our participation in reaching the SDGs has room for improvement. As we 

advance on our sustainability journey, we will continue to assess our alignment with the SDGs and, 

whenever possible, redirect our internal priorities and sustainability strategy to more effectively and 

comprehensively address the goals.

Relevant Targets to Our Businesses

http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org) 

Our Participation 

 

13.3: Improve education, awareness-raising 

and human and institutional capacity on 

climate change mitigation, adaptation, 

impact reduction and early warning. 

We have our own internal processes and 

environmental policies to reduce electricity 

and fuel consumption. Our approach to 

mitigating climate change includes staff 

training and implementing energy-efficient 

measures. We monitor and report our Green 

House Gas (“GHG”) emissions and set 

reduction targets. 

 

15.1: By 2020, ensure the conservation, 

restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial 

and inland freshwater ecosystems and their 

services, in particular forests, wetlands, 

mountains and drylands, in line with 

obligations under international agreements. 

We strive to ensure that we use paper from 

responsible sources. The paper used in our 

offices are mostly Forest Stewardship Council 

(“FSC”) 

certified, 

Programme 

for 

the 

Endorsement of Forest Certification (“PEFC”) 

certified, or made from KHAN-NA. We actively 

promote the use of such papers across our 

organisation. Through that, the Company 

supports efforts in mitigating global warming 

and the creation of positive rural community 

engagement, job opportunity, and better 

livelihood for the farmers and members of the 

community. 

 

 

 

 

 

The following SDGs goals are relevant to our 

business, operations and value chain. They are 

addressed in our various policies at group level. 

Such goals are also embedded in various initiatives 

carried out across the organisation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We do believe these goals are not relevant to our 

business or industry. They are not within our 

boundaries and scope of influence; therefore, we 

are currently unable to make noticeable 

contributions to such goals.

5 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

We believe that good CSR practice goes hand-in-hand with good corporate management practice. We 

also recognize that it is vital that our management approaches are adaptable to the dynamics of 

business and operation environment in such a way that we can continuously assess our impacts, 

develop sustainability objectives and respond in a proper manner to meet our stakeholders’ 

expectations. Our CSR framework is based on our approach to sustainability and includes policies and 

measurement mechanisms to monitor the impacts made by our businesses and operations. 

The key to the success of our sustainability programme is regular and up-to-date communication 

about our CSR policies and activities to all our stakeholders, and the provision of appropriate feedback 

mechanisms so that we can monitor and evaluate how we are doing and explore new possibilities 

stimulated by stakeholder responses. We see our sustainability reports as being a critical component 

of this continuous cycle of communication and evaluation. The overall sustainability context of the 

stakeholder engagements is managed through our CSR plan for our sustainability governance 

oversight.

Reduction of Carbon Footprint 

We recognize that the effective management and monitoring of its carbon footprint can reduce 

operating costs, raise brand profile, create a competitive edge and increase stakeholder value. Our 

carbon footprint is measured in terms of GHG emission. However, GHG emission is an absolute 

measure of how much carbon dioxide equivalent (“CO2e”) is emitted. Our GHG emission is 

predominantly indirect (Scope 2) emission. We have insignificant direct (Scope 1) emission, and we do 

not include the GHG emissions generated by our suppliers (Scope 3). 

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, we established our GHG emission 

efficiency index for consistent tracking of carbon footprint over time. To this end, we have set a target 

for GHG emission efficiency improvement of 12% from our 2019 level by 2030. Our target for GHG 

emission improvement is 1% per year. Although various business lines and operations account for 

different percentage of GHG emissions across the organisation, they all support this target and have 

aligned our environmental objectives accordingly.  

In FY2020, our GHG emission efficiency index stands at 0.0299 which is 1.6% improvement from last 

year. 

 

 

5.1.3 

Reduction of Paper Consumption 

All our employees are urged to minimize paper wastage at work. For example, double-sided printing 

is set as a default, lower grammage paper is used for daily printing, and blank sides of unneeded single-

sided copies are used for printing drafts. Paper re-use and recycling habits are also cultivated through 

initiatives such as our in-house reminders posted near the copy machines.

All waste paper from our own offices is collected for recycling. Further, we encourage all employees 

to adopt digital documents instead of paper documents with an aim to further reduce paper 

consumption. 

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, we established our paper 

consumption index for consistent tracking of paper consumption over time. To this end, we have set 

a target of 12% reduction in paper consumption by 2030. Our target for paper consumption 

improvement is 1% per year. Although various business lines and operations account for different 

percentage of paper consumption across the organisation, they all support this target and have 

aligned our environmental objectives accordingly.  

In FY2020, we consumed a total of 1,029 kg of paper, 100% of which are either FSC certified, PEFC 

certified, or made from KHAN-NA. Our paper consumption index stands at 22.27 which of 28% 

improvement as compared to FY2019 of 30.97.  

 

5.1.4 

Promoting Green Practices  

We have embraced various green practices in our business and operation such as the Eco-Office 

certification, an eco-outreach initiative by the Singapore Environment Council (“SEC”) in partnership 

with City Development Limited (“CDL”).  

Source: https://sec.org.sg/our-programmes/eco-certifications/ 

 

In addition to maximisation of cost savings as we work towards reducing water, electricity and paper 

consumption, the Eco-Office Label demonstrates our standing of being environmentally responsible 

in the eyes of the stakeholders. 

The Eco-Office initiative was launched in June 2002 to mark World Environment Day. This brings the 

environmental message to offices in Singapore by incorporating environmental practices into the daily 

lives of office workers.

5.2 Caring for Our Employees 

5.2.1 

Our Approach 

Our people are our most valuable resource and investing in their professional and personal well-being 

is vital to our business sustainability. Our goal is to establish work ethics among our employees, which 

are in line with our core values and code of conduct. They are the foundation upon which we build all 

our business initiatives and conduct our day-to-day activities.  

We recognise that a motivated workforce will convey a positive and powerful message to all our key 

stakeholders, such as our customers, suppliers and the members of the community. By attracting, 

nurturing, empowering and rewarding our employees, we create an environment conducive for 

innovation and inspiration flourish to further boost our competitiveness. Such commitment to our 

employees promotes a corporate culture of passion, quality, excellence and trust within the 

organisation which reflect in our ability to create values to our stakeholders. 

Our Human Resource (“HR”) management principles and policies have been developed and 

established based on fair employment practices with the goal of attracting, supporting and 

maintaining a motivated workforce. Our HR policies cover key areas such as remuneration, benefits, 

health and safety, career development and training. Such policies are communicated to all employees 

through our comprehensive Employee Handbook which is reviewed regularly by our management and 

we constantly seek feedback from our staff to ensure that our decisions are aligned as much as 

possible with their needs. 

Our business operates in an environment which comprises diverse races, cultures and geographic 

locations. With this in mind, our HR polices are implemented across the organisation within the 

principles with pragmatism, taking into consideration of the prevailing laws and regulations as well as 

local culture, norms and racial sensitivity. 

5.2.2 

Employment Practices 

Our employment practices focus on maximising the strength of our employees by providing equal 

opportunities based on merits, and help our employees to develop strength through our 

comprehensive training and development programme. We regularly review the performance and 

development of our employees to effectively match their strength to their job specifications. Our 

performance-based reward scheme provides guidance and motivation to our employee to perform to 

their potentials in alignment with the objectives of the Company.  

5.2.2.1 

The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices  

We proactively pursue and adopt best practices in HR management. Our HR practices are guided by 

the Singapore Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices. The Singapore 

Tripartite Alliance comprises the Ministry of Manpower, Singapore National Employers Federation and 

National Trades Union Congress. The Tripartite Alliance has formulated guidelines on fair employment 

practice for adoption by Singapore employers, embracing the recruitment, training, treatment and 

reward of employees.  

5.2.2.2 

Communications  

As our Company grows, effective communications across the organisation are crucial to ensure 

continuous alignment of objectives of the employees and the organisational objectives. We achieve 

this through our various communication sessions customized based on target employees. 

Communication sessions for our managers are held on a regular basis. Agendas covered at these 

sessions are customized in appropriate to the target functional scope of the managers. For example, 


 

 

Sustainability Report  



Page 18 of 40 

 



in monthly managers’ meeting, operational agendas such as leadership and operation issues may be 

discussed while at the annual sessions, high level topics include strategic business directions, 

commercial issues, ongoing developments and key project reviews may be discussed. 

5.2.2.3 

Employee Feedback  

We value our employee’s expertise in their areas of responsibilities. Therefore, their feedbacks are 

important in the improvement of overall management and operation of the organisation. Through 

various established processes of employee engagement, such as employee objective setting, 

performance review as well as exit interview in the case of resignations, we gather valuable feedbacks 

for the continuous improvement of our organisation. 

In addition, there are other feedback channels for areas specific to business and function, such as 

health and safety issues and compliance issues. Such feedbacks are managed by the leaders and 

managers of their specific business and function domain. We have also established reporting and 

escalation channel, should the feedback require attention of the higher management. 

5.2.2.4 

Career Development and Training 

We recognise that consistent and ongoing education is critical to maintaining a competitive, skilled, 

productive and motivated workforce. Employee career development and performance management 

are established through objective settings and regular performance reviews and are based on 

employee’s merits and contributing skill sets towards the organisation objectives. We continue to 

review and improve our career development and performance review process in light of the changing 

business and operation environment. 

Our training programme covers a variety of areas catering for employees with difference job scopes 

and skills set requirements. Our core training curriculum and contents are developed according to 

well-established industry and international standards such as bizSAFE. In addition, specific training 

curriculums are developed based on the specific requirements of the specific businesses and functions. 

Training topics range from soft skills development in areas such as communications and leadership, to 

technical programmes covering project management and office productivity tools.  

In FY2020, employees each received an average of 4.3 hours training. We recognized that the training 

requirements vary, depending on the levels of management responsibilities. Senior management, 

managerial and non-managerial staffs receive an average of 8.3 hours, 8.7 hours and 3.5 hours of 

training respectively. In light of changing business and operation requirements, we continue to revise 

our training curriculum and programme to align with the Group’s objectives and to also strive for 

effectiveness and efficiency in our training approach.

5.2.3 

Workforce Diversity 

Our business thrives on diversity. As such, we leverage on a host of strengths and skills that can only 

come from a diverse workforce embracing employees from various ethnic groups, religion, age and 

gender.  

In FY2020, 45 of our employees were female, comprising 41% of our workforce, while 66 (59%) 

employees were male. In terms of management function, 11 females (44%) held managerial positions 

compared to 14 males (56%), while 34 females (40%) and 52 males (60%) held non-managerial 

positions. The male to female ratio managerial and non-managerial positions were 14:11 and 26:17 

respectively. From age profile perspective, there were 35 employees (31%) below 30 years old. The 

number of employees between 30 and 50 years old and above 50 years old were 55 (50%) and 21 

(19%) respectively.

In FY2020, we hired a total of 18 new employees, while 14 resigned during the same period. As a result, 

we have a net increase of 4 in our workforce. Out of the new hires, 56% of the new hires were below 

the age of 30 and 44% were between 30 and 50 years old. The gender ratio of new hires was 7 males 

to 2 females. For the resignees, 29% of the resignees were below the age of 30, 57% were between 

30 and 50 years old while 14% were above 50 years old. The gender ratio of resignees was 4 males to 

3 females.  

 

 

 




 

 

Sustainability Report  



Page 23 of 40 

 



In addition to the human resources we managed under our payroll internally, we also engage external 

contracted companies as our outsourced vendors which provide outsourced personnel, such as 

cleaners and security guards who might work within our premises. Although we supervise these 

people, they are employed by contracted companies and are not included in our head count. We do 

not employ other types of un-contracted workers. 

We expect that all the contracted companies we work with will share our core principles of HR 

management practices. In our vendor selection process, we take into consideration of their HR 

management practices as one of the key selections and performance criteria. We regularly review the 

performance of our vendors based on these criteria as a key basis to determine whether to continue 

to engage the vendors with their services. 

5.2.4 

Employee Benefits 

All non-managerial employees in Singapore are covered by the Employment Act, which provides basic 

employment terms and working conditions including contract requirements, remuneration, hours of 

work, overtime, rest days and annual leave entitlement.  

In addition to the statutory benefits outlined in the Employment Act, we provide beyond-compliance-

level benefits to our fulltime employees. Examples of these benefits include paternity leave and 

compassionate leave.  

5.2.4.1 

Work–Life Balance  

While developing the talents of our employees and providing equal opportunities for them to excel 

are the key drivers for our Company, we also recognize that well-being and contentment of our 

employees are pivotal to the success and sustainability of our business and performance. Our 

employees are our most valuable asset, and we appreciate that their overall well-beings need to be 

well looked after in order for them to sustain their performance and realize their full potential.  

To support our employees to strike a work-life balance, we aim to create an environment that allows 

our employees to achieve harmony in their personal and professional life. We achieve this through 

the adoption of a flexible approach to work arrangements and offering programmes to support health 

and wellness.  

We understand that workplace could be at times stressful due to the competitiveness of our workforce 

and our business. To support our employees in their effort of pursuing excellence, we have various 

programmes and initiatives to balance their work, and to development an environment and culture of 

mutual support.  

5.2.4.2 

Retirement and Healthcare  

Our Company has presence in various geographic locations where there are various local laws and 

regulations on pension and healthcare for employees. Our HR management practices comply with 

such laws and regulations. In Singapore, we participate in the Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) personal 

savings scheme, which helps employees fund their retirement, home ownership, healthcare and 

education. Under this scheme, monthly deductions from employees’ gross salaries are paid into their 

CPF savings accounts. We, the Company, make employer contributions to these accounts, according 

to rates stipulated in the CPF Act. In addition to CPF contributions, we provide comprehensive medical 

coverage for all employees. For more information on the CPF scheme and contribution rates, please 

go to www.cpf.gov.sg.

5.2.5 

Safety and Health in the Workplace 

We are committed to Workplace Safety and Health (“WSH”) and take every precaution to prevent 

occupational injuries among employees. We believe that optimum work conditions not only make our 

employees safer, but also boost morale. As an essential requirement, we are in compliance with the 

Ministry of Manpower’s WSH Act. In addition, we have attained certification for bizSAFE. These well 

recognized standards provide us with the frameworks to manage risks associated with safety and 

health in our workplace. In FY2020, no workplace safety incident has been reported. We will continue 

to aim zero case of workplace safety and health incident.  

5.2.6 

Individual Rights  

Respecting and protecting basic human rights are fundamental to all our operations and deeply 

ingrained in our Code of Conduct, which applies to all employees. Labour rights, the prohibition of 

discrimination and harassment, protection of privacy, prohibition of forced and child labour, and 

workplace health and safety are all strictly observed within the work environment and discrimination 

and harassment of any kind are not tolerated in our Company.  

We also respect our employees’ rights to freedom of association as well as their membership of trade 

unions and other professional bodies.  

In FY2020, none of our workforce was covered by a collective bargaining agreement; no incidents of 

forced labour, child labour or young workers were identified across the organisation, and no human 

rights-related grievances have been reported.

5.3 Focusing on Our Customers’ Needs 

5.3.1 

Our Approach 

Customer service, quality products and the highest level of product safety have always been our 

priorities, with customer satisfaction being the goal of all our corporate activities. Customer retention 

begins with trust, and we place utmost importance on training our employees in customer service 

excellence as well as in continuously striving to improve the quality and safety of our products and 

services. 

Open and frequent communication and responsive feedback are ingrained into our daily activities with 

customer interaction. In addition to striving for excellence in product service and support, we attach 

enormous importance to data privacy. We have process and controls in place over confidential and 

sensitive data related to our customers such as contracts. 

In 2017, we have been certified for Business Excellence. In 2020, we have passed the renewal 

assessment and have again been certified for Business Excellence. The Business Excellence initiative 

enable us to assess our organisational performance based on the internationally benchmark Business 

Excellence framework. It provides an external perspective of our business’ strengths and area for 

improvement. 

Since 2019, we have been certified under the ISO 9001 standard for quality management systems. The 

certification has helped us increase the control of our internal processes and the quality of our services.  

5.3.2 

Customer Feedback and Satisfaction 

We listen to our customers and take their opinions very seriously. We consolidate customers’ 

feedback through a range of communication channels including our website, and regular customer 

visits. Through our customer feedback system, we capture our customers’ comments for analysis and 

action. Customers’ complaints on our services are captured and the corrective and preventive action 

are proposed, implemented and recorded as part of our service improvement process. Customers’ 

compliments are also tracked so that we can monitor where we are getting things right and cascade 

positive feedback to our employees, to their superiors and to our CEO.  

5.3.3 

Service Quality and Safety 

Reliability and quality of our products are of paramount importance to us. Health and safety of our 

customers is always our priority. To ensure product safety to our customers, we have in place a set of 

key quality assurance processes and standards, such as ISO 9001 and bizSAFE to ensure compliance 

with regulations and international standards. No incident of product safety reported. We aim to 

sustain the product safety incident at zero rate so as to foster a ‘Safety First’ culture through employee 

training and quality control.  

5.3.4 

Data Safety and Privacy  

Ensuring safety and privacy of our customers’ data is of great priority to us. We have processes and 

controls in place for handling and communicating sensitive and confidential information of our 

customers such as contracts, customer orders and service delivery orders. Our information security 

policies ensure our customers’ data are managed in accordance to the level of confidentiality. We 

strictly observe all local laws and internal regulations applicable to personal information protection. 

For the collection and disposal of wastepaper, we work with our office cleaning personnel for handling 

and reselling of wastepaper to recovery companies for pragmatic reasons. Every individual is 

responsible for the shredding of all papers, including confidential documents, before disposing into 


 

 

Sustainability Report  



Page 26 of 40 

 



paper recycling boxes situated near photocopiers and printers. Such practice established within our 

office provides us with the confidence that sensitive information is protected during the whole life 

cycle of our documents. 

5.4 Partnering Our Suppliers 

5.4.1 

Our Approach 

As a part of our ambition to realize sustainability throughout our value chain, we extend the 

application of responsible business practices to our local partners and suppliers. We recognise that 

we are only at the beginning of our journey to integrate sustainable business practice throughout our 

supply chain, and we commit in our pragmatic approach to continuous improvement. We aim to 

identify new opportunities for collaboration with our suppliers, gradually increase transparency and 

continue to build shared capacity to minimise our indirect environmental and social impacts. 

5.4.2 

Supplier Selection 

Our key suppliers are carefully selected through our supplier selection process. When selecting our 

key suppliers, we examine criteria such as financial health, quality of products and services, as well as 

competitiveness of pricing. In addition, we also take into consideration of the overall sustainability 

policies adopted by our suppliers. Our final decision on supplier selection is based on the overall 

assessment which takes a balanced view across all selection criteria. 

5.4.3 

Supplier Review  

We regularly review the performance of our key suppliers to determine whether to extend our 

partnership with them. During the key supplier review process, we engage with our key suppliers to 

communicate our expectations and mutual feedbacks. Such review process ensures alignment of our 

key suppliers’ services and products to our business requirements and sustainability objectives 

through pragmatic and continuous improvement in our partnership with our key suppliers.

6 PERFORMANCE TABLE AND TARGETS 

6.1 Energy Usage and CO2 Emissions  

GHG emissions are measured in tonnes (t-CO2); the underlying measures for direct and indirect CO2 

emissions calculation are electricity consumption in kilowatt Hours (kWh) and fuel consumed. The 

electricity and fuel we purchase are both from non-renewable sources. 

Our business and function grow over time; the GHG emissions and electricity consumption vary. To 

ensure consistency and comparability of the GHG emission and electricity consumption measures over 

time, we create a GHG emission index and electricity consumption index for our performance 

monitoring. The index adjusts the GHG emissions and electricity consumption for the size of our 

activities. We normalize the amount GHG emissions and electricity consumption by the amount of our 

revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. The GHG emission index is measured in 

t-CO2 per SGD million and the electricity consumption index is measured in kWh per SGD million.

6.2 Paper Consumption 

We capture the data for paper consumption by the amount of paper reams used where one ream is 

equivalent to 500 sheets of paper. To ensure consistency and comparability across various paper sizes, 

such as A3 and A4 papers, we measure the paper consumption by the weight of paper used which is 

adjusted for the various sizes and quality of papers. 

Our business and function grow over time and the paper consumption patterns vary. We devise a 

paper consumption index for our performance monitoring. The index adjusts the paper consumption 

for the size of our activities. We normalize the amount of weights of paper consumed by the amount 

of our revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. The paper consumption index is 

measured in kilograms per million SGD.
