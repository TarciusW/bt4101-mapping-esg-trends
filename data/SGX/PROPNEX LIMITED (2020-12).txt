ABOUT

THIS REPORT


2020 marks another milestone in PropNex’s history as the Group celebrates 20 years of trusted service in real estate. We are 

delighted to share that PropNex has a stronger foothold in the Singapore’s property industry -- producing unprecedented 

30 Millionaire Achievers in FY2020. Today, we continue to be the market leader in new launches and in attracting record 

number of experienced and new salespersons to join PropNex. Despite the global COVID pandemic, it is commendable that 

we achieved a revenue of $515.6 million for FY2020.

While the market was impacted by the circuit breaker period in Singapore, PropNex was able to harness our exceptional 

assets – leveraging on the strong branding and talent of our people across the Company, to win in the marketplace.

A cornerstone of our success is our focus on sustainability. Sustainability is fundamental to achieving our long-term vision of 

success. We have incorporated considerations for social and governance factors in the way we grow our business, cultivate 

our people and serve our communities. This is based on the belief that PropNex will thrive when our people are motivated, 

committed and empowered to continuously improve themselves and give back to society.

With support of the Sustainability Steering Committee (“SSC”), composed of our management team, we have considered 

sustainability issues as part of our strategic formulation, determined the material ESG factors, overseen the management and 

monitoring of the ESG factors. The SSC will continue to assist the Board in integrating ESG considerations into our strategic 

formulation, as well as monitor, manage and report on our ESG performance.

Our commitment to service excellence has enabled us to become Singapore’s largest home-grown listed real estate agency 

and we will continue to drive our business for years to come. We take pride in our motto “Service You Trust” and together with 

our Core Values, our business decisions are made with the aim of taking pole position in the market.

We are pleased to share with you PropNex’s approach to sustainability and efforts taken to be a sustainable business in the 

Group’s Sustainability Report.

BOARD

STATEMENT

02


We soared as Singapore’s largest listed real estate agency and continued to grow our salesforce. We recorded a total of 9,050 

salespersons as at 8 February 2021. PropNex has proven to be the preferred agency of choice by clients and salespersons 

and we are on track in realising our vision of having 10,000 PropNex salespersons by 2022. As a brand owner-manager, we 

also possess a strong desire to build the PropNex brand into a leading regional brand.

The pandemic had created new norms in the way we conduct our business. As the Group had invested over S$2 million in 

IT infrastructure and IT-related training in 2019, this allowed our accelerated adoption of technology in 2020. As a result, the 

Group was able to react swiftly during the crisis. Our salesforce effectively used these myriad virtual platforms to continuously 

engage their clients via webinars and managed to close million-dollar private and HDB properties, despite the restrictions 

brought about by the pandemic.

Aside from delivering a commendable set of financial results in 2020, we stayed true to our continued focus on corporate 

citizenry as well. We donated $750,000 to The Community Chest, at an event officiated by Minister Desmond Lee and the 

Chairman of The Community Chest, Mr Phillip Tan during our Mid-Year Virtual Convention in September 2020. We were 

heartened to see that the $250,000 went to helping the vulnerable communities who were affected by the COVID-19 situation 

as well as the frontline heroes who were fighting the virus. Since 2013, PropNex has been contributing $500,000 annually to 

benefit underprivileged children and the less fortunate.

On the client-front, the Group launched a new customer marketing programme -- PropNex Friends -- in December 2020. 

This formation of a community was created with the aim of staying close to our customers through curated, personalised 

experiences.

The achievements we have accomplished today, after 20 years in the real estate business, are made possible by our very own 

salespersons, managers, leaders and also all our PropNex staff who have continued to trust in the PropNex brand. It is through 

their belief and efforts that have made us number one in the industry.

We will continue to fly the PropNex flag high, backed by their trust and support, as well as that of our clients, developers and 

partners.

With Service You Trust,

Ismail Gafoor

To identify and prioritise material ESG factors that are important to our business and key stakeholders, we have implemented 

a three-step materiality assessment process that is in line with GRI Standards’ Materiality Principle.

annually to ensure their relevance.

We help our people establish a fulfilling career at PropNex by offering them the care, guidance and resources they need to 

continuously improve themselves, exercise entrepreneurship and achieve autonomy.

EMPLOYMENT

The collective sum of our people – including their life experiences, knowledge, creativity and talent – represents the PropNex 

culture, reputation and achievements. We are committed to recruiting, cultivating and retaining staff and salespersons that 

believe in and practise our core values, and who consistently strive to provide service that our customers trust.

Recruitment

Staff

Our Recruitment &amp; Selection Policy and Diversity Policy guides the recruitment of our employees. We embrace and encourage 

our employees’ differences in age, colour, ethnicity, marital status, gender, national origin, political affiliation, race, religion, 

sexual orientation and other characteristics that make our employees unique.

At PropNex, we take cultivating a culture of diversity and inclusion seriously. Employees who believe they have been subjected 

to any kind of discrimination that conflicts with our Diversity Policy are encouraged to seek assistance from their immediate 

superior or the Human Resources Department. Any employee found to have exhibited any inappropriate conduct or behaviour 

against others may be subject to disciplinary action.

Our referral programme encourages our staff and salespersons to recommend suitable candidates to apply for job openings 

at PropNex. Upon appointment and subsequent confirmation in the position, a referral fee will be awarded to the referee.

Salespersons

Our cultivation of salespersons begins even before they become a PropNexian and extends to providing assistance to new 

real estate salespersons (“RES”) candidates. Any person interested in becoming a RES is welcome to participate in our Real 

Estate Programme in RES Study Groups and we train and guide new RES candidates in preparation for the RES exam. Once 

they pass the RES exam, they will be eligible to participate in our recruitment programme (Success Seminar) for brand-new 

RES and activities like the Accelerated Closing System (“ACS”) for experienced RES.

All employment conditions, including responsibilities and the split of commission, are stated in the Associate Agreement that 

our salespersons sign with us. We require our salespersons to review their contract with us at least once every two years to 

ensure that they are reminded of and fully understand their employment conditions. For our Team Leaders, we ask that they 

sign an additional contract when they become Team Leaders to ensure they understand their role and responsibilities.

professional progression. Each roadmap can be further customised according to and based upon the needs, level of

Advanced training programmes are also available for experienced salespersons or those who have chosen to become a 

Team Leader through the Dual Career Path Scheme.

Addressing COVID-19

In light of the current COVID-19 situation, we leverage on online alternatives like e-learning to substitute physical classes. In 

playing our part in the community to slow the transmission of the virus, PropNex had suspended physical trainings last year like 

bootcamps. In light of the challenging times, we rolled out a $28.8m PropNex Resilience Package, in helping our salespersons 

to tide over the period. It consisted of Commission Express Scheme (New Launches &amp; Resale Properties), Overriding Express 

Service for PropNex Team Leaders &amp; Early Pension Payouts, Waived off for Auto Deduction of 2021 Convention Fee, Subsidized

courses, track their training progress and make sure that they have completed all compulsory training, including those required 

by PropNex and fulfilling CPD credits mandated by the Council for Estate Agencies (“CEA”) regulatory framework.

2020 Performance against 2020 Targets: Average training hours for our staffs remain similar to 2019 and we have shifted 

many of the physical training to be conducted online via webinar over the weekends and during working hours due to the 

COVID situation. However, our salespersons’ trainings were increased.

Our mission is to enhance customers’ quality of life through value-added professional service. Property purchases are 

important life decisions and we are committed to sharing our knowledge with our customers and consumers at large to help 

them make the right choices.

SERVING OUR 

CUSTOMERS

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS

We believe the key to achieving this is to conduct our business ethically, honestly and with integrity, thereby serving as a role 

model for others. PropNex does not tolerate any acts of fraud and corruption, and follows all laws and regulations relevant to 

our business.

Like other real estate practitioners, PropNex adheres to the regulatory framework of the Estate Agents Act, established by 

the CEA, a government agency under the Ministry of National Development. PropNex regularly collaborates with CEA on 

industry development programmes and supports them in protecting the interests of the consumers through targeted public 

education schemes.

Being a service-oriented company working closely with customers, PropNex also closely abides by the Personal Data Protection 

Act, ensuring the security of our customers’ private data.

Furthermore, our employees and salespersons must abide by the PropNex Code of Conduct, Staff Handbook, Associate 

Agreements and various corporate policies, such as the Conflict of Interest Policy. They must also conduct themselves in a 

professional and ethical manner. For our salespersons, we have implemented the Annual CEA License Renewal Exercise Policy

EMBRACING OUR 

COMMUNITY

PropNex strives to be a positive corporate citizen and influence, both for our society today as well as future generations. 

We do this by championing our core values of respect and concern for others, in reaching out and helping less privileged 

communities.

Since 2000, we have been involved in various charitable events and championed numerous meaningful causes, in Singapore 

and overseas. Our CSR Philosophy, “Empowering Future Generations through Education”, guides our CSR initiatives. We review 

current initiatives and plan for future CSR direction and initiatives during our strategic meetings.

PropNex firmly believes in contributing back to the communities around us and in which we operate, at the company, team 

and individual levels. We can only truly help our communities when a culture of giving is instilled in each and every one of our 

employees and salespersons. PropNex has established programmes and initiatives to enable everyone within the PropNex 

family to easily be involved with and contribute to our CSR initiatives.

PropNex has adopted Community Chest as its main charity 

beneficiary since 2013. Through Community Chest, we support myriad 

social service programmes that assist over 300,000 people in need in 

Singapore. We have also expressed a preference for adopting schools 

and centres that cater to children with special needs and disabilities as 

beneficiaries, to further align our contribution with our CSR philosophy.

Continuing our commitment of an annual $500,000 in donations since 

2015, we contributed another $$529,179 to Community Chest in 2020 

through our monthly SHARE and Sponsor-A-Child programme. The 

funds raised will help to improve facilities and programmes provided 

at our adopted beneficiaries, Pathlight School, AWWA, Care Corner 

Student Care Centre, SHINE and Metta Welfare Association.

Technology in the real estate realm has disrupted and transformed how business is conducted, and will continue to play a 

pivotal role in the way corporations conduct their business.

One of our key strategies is the empowerment of our people by enhancing our technological capabilities. We are committed 

to improving our salespersons’ productivity by providing relevant and reliable technological support. This in turn helps them to 

provide better customer service for their clients.

Our Information Technology (“IT”) Working Committee has developed the PropNex IT Roadmap to guide our future investments 

in technological and digital innovation. In consultation with our salespersons, we identified their needs and challenges. These 

were then translated into modules and focal points in our Roadmap. We continuously evaluate our IT needs and calibrate our 

IT Roadmap accordingly throughout the year.

Long term target

We aim to achieve the following through the implementation of our IT Roadmap:

• 

Digitalise manual procedures and processes;

• 

Reduce redundancies in procedures and processes;

• 

Facilitate the collaboration and sharing of resources amongst salespersons;

• 

Enable consumers to access relevant property information more easily.

As of 2020, we have developed several technological solutions that aim to assist our salespersons, as summarized below.

This app transforms the way our salespersons work 

as it frees up our salespersons’ time on administrative 

work 

and 

improves 

the 

productivity 

of 

our 

salespersons. Some of the new features include Asset 

Planning 2.0 calculator so that our salespersons 

could assist clients in their assessment of risks before 

committing a property purchase. Other new features 

include a new Savings Plan, handover report, spot 

resale and bundle deals.

PropNex has raised the bar by being the first to roll out 

these new  features in the industry, setting ourselves 

apart from others and leading with innovative 

practices.

The group had also trained our salesforce on the usage of Zoom webinars, so that they could do virtual presentations and 

even viewings.

REVAMPED WEBSITE

We took the opportunity to revamp our PropNex website and had completely changed the overall presentation and user 

experience, targeting at home investors in search of their dream homes. This offers another channel for our agents to display 

their listings more prominently for exposure.

INNOVATING ON 

THE DIGITAL FRONT


Rampant use of energy from non-renewable sources can cause global warming and, through the resultant melting of the 

polar ice caps, subsequent sea level rise. As a small island state of which a third is below five metres above means sea level, 

climate change can adversely impact Singapore and the main business of PropNex: real estate.

We have logged our electrical consumption captured at various corporate premises at HDB Hub Levels 10, 11 and 18, Branch 

Office and General Magnetic Building. Tabulations were based on utility bills from the electricity supplier.

All electricity is purchased from the national grid and is produced almost entirely by the combustion of natural gas, which is 

classified as Scope 2 emissions.

A total 525,637.4kWh of electricity was used, which translates to 112.3tCO2e.

No incident of non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations were identified within the reporting year.

ENVIRONMENT


As the nation’s largest real estate agency, PropNex fulfils an important role within the real estate sector by facilitating the 

buying, selling, renting and leasing of property in Singapore.

In line with our vision of having the strength of a big company and our status as a listed entity on the Singapore Exchange, 

PropNex also contributes to the economy by providing gainful employment to thousands of employees and salespersons.

The Group’s revenue increased by approximately S$95.8 million or 22.8%, to S$515.6 million in FY2020, from S$419.8 million 

in financial year ended 2019. This was mainly attributable to the increase in commission income from project marketing 

services of S$83.8 million and an increase in agency services of S$13.1 million, as a result of the higher number of transactions 

completed in FY2020.

The Group’s salesforce grew from 8,324 as at 1 January 2020 to 8,918 as at 1 January 2021. Consequently, net profit after tax 

came in at 47.8% year-on-year growth for FY2020 to S$31.2 million, despite COVID-19 and resulting restrictions in Singapore.

You may refer to our financial results announcements on SGXNET or PropNex’s corporate website for more information.

No incident of non-compliance with socio-economic laws and regulations were identified within the reporting year
