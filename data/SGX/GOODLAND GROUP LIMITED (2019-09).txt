SUSTAINABILTY FACTORS, RISKS, OPPORTUNITIES, GOALS AND TARGETS  

 

In today’s multi-faceted business climate, effective risk management is required to 

achieve continuous profitable growth. As such, ESG factors are thoughtfully considered 

before being integrated into the Group’s organisational decision-making processes. 

 

8.1 

Environmental Factors 

 

The Group is committed to minimising its environmental impact as a real estate owner, 

developer and manager. It believes that lowering the environmental footprint of its 

buildings through innovation creates value for its stakeholders. 

 

The incorporates environmental sustainability in our projects, from feasibility, design, 

procurement, construction, operation to redevelopment. Monitoring environmental 

impacts is integral to its business operations, as efficient use of environmental resources 

such as energy and water contributes to the operational efficiency and long-term 

sustainability of the company. 

 

We strive to improve our environmental performance over time and to initiate additional 

projects and activities that will further reduce the impact of the Group’s activities on the 

environment and the public. 

 

Our commitment to the environment extends to our customers, staff and the community 

in which we operate.   We are committed to: 

 minimise or prevent pollution and ensure that working environment is kept clean and 

in good order at all times whenever possible 

 train all staff on our environmental management program and empower them to

customers, staff and our community

through regular audits 

 care and consideration for the safety of site personnel, visitors and the general public 

 understand, implement and comply with all applicable environmental regulations  


7 | P a g e 

 





In FY2019, our initiative to reduce the heat of building and energy costs gets us started a 

rooftop garden growing plants and vegetables at our headquarter, Goodland Group 

Building. We also use food waste as fertiliser. The rooftop garden not only saves the 

energy of the building, but also promote recycling of food waste to a useful fertiliser for 

the plants and vegetables. 

 

Energy 

 

The Group’s efforts on mitigating energy consumption include: 

 

use of energy saving equipment such as the use of solar panel to power equipment 

such as the noise monitoring equipment 

 

efficient design of site office/work 

 

use of alternating current grid power supply and diesel-powered generators 

 

continuously monitoring electricity and diesel consumption with allocated budget  

 

Water 

 

The Group’s efforts on mitigating water consumption include: 

 

use of treated re-cycled water for cleaning purposes on site 

 

provision of perimeter drains, silt traps, and sealing up of gaps at the base of 

hoardings to help contain surface run-off within the site 

 

Waste 

 

The Group’s efforts on managing waste include: 

 

continuously monitoring building materials requirement throughout the project 

 

consolidation and re-use of used building materials for future projects 

 

reuse of recycled galvanized iron pipe and scaffolding as formwork support which 

reduces the use of timber plank 

 

 

8.2 

Social Factors 

 

Occupational Health and Safety 

 

Occupational health and safety (OHS) of our staff, tenants, contractors, suppliers and 

the communities who use its properties, is of utmost importance to the Group. Effective 

OHS management is part of risk management and deemed to enhance staff 

productivity and morale.  The Group’s efforts on public safety include the use of proper 

full-height hoarding of the construction site, provision of site safety information and 

sufficient signages to visitors and the use of traffic cones or barriers to raise awareness of 

construction activities 

 

Noise and Vibrations 

 

The Group’s efforts on reducing noise and vibrations includes: 

 

installation of instruments to manage noise and vibration levels 

 

use newer equipment/machinery to achieve lower noise emissions 

 

Supply Chain 

 

Building materials are purchased by contractors. As such, the Group has limited control 

over the type and quantity of materials purchased for the development projects. Instead, 

the scope of disclosure for materials is confined to areas it has operational control: the 

promoting of responsible sourcing practices along the supply chain, and to encourage 

the use of eco-friendly and recycled materials.  For example, we used green products 

that are certified by PSB Singapore for construction, such as Davco Eco-friendly 

waterproofing and plastering, tile adhesive &amp; etc.

Talent Retention  

 

Goodland advocates and invests in the development of employees to fulfil their 

potential and contribute towards the progress of the Group, including the sponsorship of 

degree and diploma programmes. Our employees are encouraged to attend 

conferences and seminars to acquire knowledge to meet their relevant work 

requirements. Goodland conducts In-house training regularly to enhance employee’s 

understanding of the Group’s products and operations and to align staff with the 

Group’s objectives.

relationship with our neighbourhood, which include:

delivered to construction site to minimize public inconvenience  

 

provision of repairs and repainting work to affected neighbours  

 

 

Community

longer term, this strengthens the Group’s social licence to operate and ability to deliver 

sustainable value.  We are committed to continually engaging our employees in our 

corporate social responsibility initiatives and efforts. 

 

In giving back to the community, Goodland:

8.3 

Corporate Governance 

Goodland is committed to ensuring and maintaining a high standard of corporate 

governance and business conduct to safeguard the interests of its stakeholders. We are 

dedicated to uphold integrity and honesty in our operations.  The Board acknowledges 

that it is responsible for the governance of risks and the overall internal control framework, 

but recognises that no cost effective internal control system will preclude all errors and 

irregularities, as the system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure 

to achieve business objectives, and can provide only reasonable and not absolute 

assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poor judgment in decision-making, 

human errors, losses, fraud or other irregularities. The Board will, on a continuing basis, 

endeavour to further enhance and improve the Group’s system of internal controls and 

risk management policies. 

 

During the 10th Singapore Corporate Governance Week 2019 organised by the 

Securities Investors Association (Singapore) (“SIAS”), Goodland joined SIAS and its 

partners to publicly endorse the Statement of Support initiative which advocates 

excellence in corporate governance 

 

ANTI-CORRUPTION 

 

The Group has incorporated “whistle blowing” procedures as part of the Group’s system 

of internal controls. This is to provide a channel for employees of the Group to report in 

good faith and in confidence, without fear of reprisals, concerns about possible 

improprieties in financial reporting and other matters. The objective of the policy is to 

ensure that there is independent investigation of such matters and that appropriate 

follow up actions will be taken.  For FY2019, there were no reports received. 

 

In addition, the Group’s sets out expectations of employees in relation to issues such as 

fraud, conflicts of interest and anti-competitive conduct in the employees’ handbook.  

For FY2019, the Group achieved the target of zero confirmed incidents of concerning 

employees or business partners.  

 

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS &amp; REGULATIONS 

 

The Group adheres to the Code of Corporate Governance 2012, listing rules and 

regulations set out by SGX, the MAS Securities and Futures Act, the Singapore Code of 

Advertising Practice, the Personal Data Protection Act, as well as all other applicable 

laws and regulations. 

 

For our developments, the Group is subject to regulations administered by Urban 

Redevelopment Authority (URA), Building and Construction Authority (BCA), National 

Environment Agency (NEA), Public Utilities Board (PUB), Land Transport Authority (LTA) 

and others. 

 

There were no incidents of non-compliance with laws and regulations, including 

environmental regulations and marketing guidelines, resulting in significant fines or 

sanctions in FY2019. 

 

8.4 

Performance Measurement 

The factors identified and the corresponding performance measurement during the 

financial year ended 30 September 2019 are shown in Table 8.1 below. 

 

We have set the same qualitative and quantitative sustainability targets for FY2019, as
