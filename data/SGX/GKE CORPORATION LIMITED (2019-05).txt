This is the second sustainability 

report (“Report”) for GKE Corporation 

Limited (“GKE” or “Company”, together 

with its subsidiaries, “Group”) and 

the relevant topics covered in this 

Report for the financial year ended 

31 May (“FY2019”) are based on 

the results of the previous year’s 

materiality 

process. 

Taking 

into 

account business developments, as 

well as our stakeholders’ interests, 

we have continued to report on 

similar subjects in this year’s report. 

The Board of Directors of the 

Company (“Board”) believes this 

report is a reasonable and clear 

presentation of the Company’s plans 

and of its environmental, social and 

governance performance. The Board 

has emphasised that management 

will continue to be evaluated by its 

success in executing the Company’s 

strategic plan to meet stakeholders’ 

and 

the 

Board’s 

expectations, 

including being agile in responding 

to changing circumstances while 

respecting the commitments in this 

Report.

Our Strategy

In 

times 

of 

climate 

change, 

growing competitive pressure in a 

globalised society, and competition 

to attract the best and most capable 

talents, sustainability has a special 

significance. At GKE, sustainability is 

approached holistically to create and 

continuously improve a sustainable 

company delivering long term value 

for all our stakeholders: customers, 

employees, suppliers, investors and 

the communities in which we operate. 

We believe that sustainability is 

everyone’s responsibility and that 

a sound corporate sustainability 

governance framework promotes 

strong 

leadership 

by 

all 

our 

management.

Maintaining cost competitiveness, 

productivity, service excellence and 

quality are some of the challenges 

that we face in our industry. Hence, 

we are constantly exploring new 

opportunities to grow our business 

and enter new markets. To maintain 

our strong and consistent focus, 

we are building on our existing 

framework and using new insights to 

deepen our approach. We also need 

to deliver our products and services 

in an innovative and sustainable 

way, which means listening to and 

collaborating with our stakeholders, 

and 

becoming 

more 

agile 

in 

innovating new solutions.

The sustainability focus for GKE 

is delivering long-term value for 

all our stakeholders: customers, 

employees, 

investors 

and 

the 

communities in which we operate. 

Within this sustainability approach, 

we take the broader economic, 

governance and social aspects, such 

as labour practices, human rights, 

and 

societal 

responsibility, 

into 

account. This approach guarantees 

that our services and solutions are 

provided to our customers in a 

manner that is respectful to people, 

the environment and is economically 

smart every time.

Our services are often a critical 

part of the supply chains of other 

businesses. We help people receive 

the materials they need to create 

products and then help deliver those 

products to their customers. When 

we operate more efficiently, we 

in turn help reduce the emissions 

intensity of supply chains worldwide.

This commitment to sustainability 

involves ensuring that strong ethical, 

social and environmental criteria 

are integrated in our Company’s 

strategy and business model and in 

its internal policies and processes.

In structure and topic range, our Report for FY2019 takes reference from the previous year’s Report. A thorough 

analysis conducted in FY2018 identified what topics and areas of activity we consider relevant for GKE’s Report. We 

identified not only GRI topics, but also key areas of GKE sustainability management as important potential reporting 

content. Through ongoing consultation with related departments, we have reviewed our material topics internally 

and taken into account new businesses and the relevance of our material topics. There have been no changes to our 

material topics for FY2019.

The top eight (8) material topics have 

been grouped according to the focus 

areas listed below. Where applicable,

PERFORMANCE

Overview


Regulatory compliance is critically 

important to GKE, serving to protect 

our integrity and reputation and 

foster trust among stakeholders. 

Observance 

of 

all 

regulatory 

requirements forms the basis of 

good corporate governance within 

the Group. We also ensure our 

compliance to all relevant local and 

international laws and regulations, 

including 

the 

principles 

and 

guidelines set out in the Singapore 

Code of Corporate Governance 

2012. More details can be found in 

our Annual Report for FY2019.

SOciOecOnOmic cOmPliance 

(gri 419-1)

We had no cases of socioeconomic 

non-compliance 

in 

FY2019. We 

strive to continue to maintain zero 

non-compliance cases in FY2020.



In FY2019, GKE had distributed 

around 37.5% of our revenues 

to key stakeholders – 32.3% to 

employees, 2.3% to government in 

countries where we operate, namely 

Singapore and China, and 2.8% to 

capital providers. 

There was an overall loss from our 

continuing operations in FY2019 

and the overall economic value 

retained is a negative $S2.0 million. 

More details of our economic 

performance can be found in our 

Annual Report for FY2019.

ECONOMIC ENHANCEMENT &amp;

cOmPliance


We are sensitive to the environmental 

impact across our business operations, 

and are committed to taking steps to 

reduce our impact, especially the 

waste generated and GHG emissions. 

Fuel and energy consumption is 

managed and monitored by the 

various business units.

GKE Corporation is committed to 

reducing our environmental footprint 

through two (2) key approaches:

environmental 

regulations), 

after 

which the incinerated ash is sent 

to landfill. We are exploring ways 

to improve our waste segregation 

to improve on the volume of 

recyclables in the coming years. 

Since 2018, iPads have been used 

for Board meetings to reduce the 

amount of paper used for printing 

minutes 

of 

meetings, 

agendas 

and other attachments. For other 

meeting, projectors are used to 

present meeting materials. As far 

as possible, we are moving towards 

a paperless environment in all our 

business units. We aim to recycle 

our used carton boxes and shrink 

wrap and in FY2019, 15,950kg of 

carton boxes and 17,978kg of plastic 

shrink wrap generated mostly from 

our warehousing operations was 

recycled. We have also incinerated 

142,100kg of general waste. There 

was no hazardous waste disposed 

in the reporting year.

reDucing Our ghg emiSSiOnS 

(gri 305-1, 305-2) 

 

As a leading warehousing and 

logistics solutions provider, we have 

a dedicated and modern fleet for 

our operational needs. We operate 

our own fleet of vehicles including 

prime movers and trailers. Our 

vehicles from the logistics business 

accounts for approximately 50.0% 

of total fuel consumption while the 

remaining 50.0% is attributed to 

our readymix cement business. In 

FY2019, our total greenhouse gas 

emissions for our Singapore and China 

operations amounted to 3,935 tonnes 

CO2 comprising largely of Scope 1 

emissions from the use of diesel 

for logistics and from the readymix 

cement business in China. The overall 

increase in GHG emissions was due to 

an increase in business as well as an 

increase in our boundary of reporting 

which now includes our operations in 

China. 

Our emissions for the last two years 

are shown in the table in page 10. With 

more data collected from our various 

business units, we intend to use these 

values to compare with values for the 

next year so that we can determine our 

targets and areas for improvements in 

FY2020. 

We have also replaced our older trucks 

with Euro 6 model in our logistics 

business, which are in compliance 

with local National Environmental 

Agency regulations, and will also help 

to reduce nitrogen oxides pollutants 

and fine particulate matter.

One of our new business initiatives 

currently 

underway 

is 

the 

construction of a new recycling plant 

– Cenxi Haoyi Recycling, which will 

recycle material waste arising from 

mining, construction, manufacturing 

and 

other 

related 

processes 

into 

reusable 

construction 

raw 

materials. Every year a large part of 

recyclable materials is disposed of 

in landfills or arbitrarily discharged 

to the environment. To ensure 

the 

sustainability 

of 

building 

construction materials, it is essential 

to utilise production waste. By 

recycling waste products arising 

from mining, manufacturing and 

construction activities into reusable 

raw materials for manufacturing of 

ready-mix concrete, it can help to 

reduce the environmental impact 

associated 

with 

the 

transport 

of materials and mining of new 

materials. This recycling plant is 

being built in Longmu village, in 

Cenxi city in the People’s Republic 

of China.

secured to prevent loss of data. 

CCTV cameras are installed at

across the various GKE subsidiaries. 

We shall strive to continue to

But 

with

Our people are our most important 

asset. 

Neglecting 

their 

health 

and safety would not only be 

irresponsible 

and 

unethical 

but 

would also endanger our business 

performance. Our employees are 

encouraged to take ownership when 

it comes to health and safety. Our 

health and safety approach applies 

at all levels of the organisation, from 

a trip hazard in a corridor at head 

office, to a partially closed truck 

door, or pallets stacked too high in 

a warehouse – all GKE employees 

should identify a potential danger 

and take immediate action to resolve.

Our health and safety representatives 

from the various business units help 

to integrate health and safety into 

the daily strategic and operational 

planning for the organisation. GKE 

Express Logistics Pte Ltd is certified 

for ISO 9001 and has achieved 

Workplace 

Safety 

and 

Health 

(WSH) bizSAFE Level 3 since 2017. 

GKE has in place a health, safety 

and 

environment 

system 

with 

defined safe work procedures, risk 

assessments and other relevant 

work instructions for our staff and 

contractors.

GKE has also conducted health and 

safety days regularly to promote 

awareness to the employee.

Last year, we had two (2) cases of 

reportable accidents which resulted 

in a total of 26 days lost. We have 

since made improvements to our 

equipment and work procedures 

to address the root cause of these 

accidents, and communicated these 

to our employees to raise their 

awareness on lessons that can be 

learnt, with an aim to minimise the 

number of lost days in FY2020.
