The Group’s Lifestyle Division is focused on marketing and distributing brands in the beauty, wellness and lifestyle 

categories, working with leading e-commerce platforms as well as traditional retailers. The brands distributed by the

ABOUT THAKRAL 

CORPORATION LTD

The Group’s Investment Division was set up to create a sustainable second revenue stream and contribute to positive 

shareholder value.

Thakral Capital Holdings Pte Ltd (“TCH”), the holding company of the Group’s Investment Division in Australia, was 

incorporated in 2009 and the TCH group started operations in Australia as TCAP in early 2011, originating, packaging 

and managing investments for the Group.

The division has been the financial backer and investment partner for a slew of major apartment and townhouse 

developments in Australia since 2010, investing and committing in excess of A$380 million of capital into projects 

with an end value surpassing A$3.5 billion. It has to date successfully completed 17 projects, with another 15 in the 

pipeline, 6 of which are under construction.

The division’s retirement living joint venture with the Puljich family, under the GemLife brand, continues to leverage on 

their 30 years of experience in building one of Australia’s most well-known and respected brands in the resort style 

retirement homes sector. To date, five resorts with more than 1,200 homes to be built throughout the east coast of 

Australia are underway, of which four resorts have commenced construction, and a further six with more than 1,100 

homes have been contracted. The Group’s diversification into the retirement living segment is expected to provide 

sustainable returns in a growing sector that is less affected by movements in the core housing market.

BOARD

STATEMENT

BOARD

STATEMENT

Dear Stakeholders,

The Group is pleased to publish its Sustainability Report for FY2018, which is our second year of sustainability reporting, 

with which we aim to strengthen our commitment towards operational sustainability and corporate responsibility. Our 

Management continues to dedicate itself in the creation of long term strategies in the management of the Economic 

and Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) factors.

The Management has established a Sustainability Working Group (“SWG”), which works under the guidance of the 

Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) to ensure that sustainability measures are implemented across the business 

and the business is on track to achieve its sustainability goals and objectives.

OUR ACHIEVEMENTS

We strongly value the relationships with our stakeholders, and also strongly believe in committing to governance and 

incorporating sustainability measures in our business model which allows us to give back to the community and further 

translates into positive growth and results for the Group. During the financial year, the Group made noteworthy progress 

with respect to the management of the ESG factors.

ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL

Incorporating operational sustainability and corporate responsibility in our business model has allowed the Group 

to achieve long term growth and focus on creating value which reflect positively on the Group by rewarding its 

shareholders with positive returns. By implementing effective corporate governance measures, the Group has focused 

and strengthened its two core divisions – Investment and Lifestyle – amid the changing business landscapes and 

challenging global market environment.

In order to be a successful and sustainable business, it is vital for us to adopt various environmental friendly measures 

into our business strategies. The Management is committed to being environmentally conscientious by meeting all 

applicable green standards and energy efficiencies in our day-to-day business operations across the region.

In Australia, our Investment Division continues to encourage its partners to meet all applicable green standards, 

obtain energy efficiency and green ratings wherever possible and to deliver designs and use eco-friendly materials to 

minimise the environmental impact on the community where the developments are located. The Group’s joint venture 

retirement living resorts under the GemLife brand are designed to offer residents high quality livable units that are both 

attractive and environmentally-friendly. Installation of solar panels at the GemLife Bribie Island resort commenced in 

2018. Similarly, energy efficient air-conditioning and lighting was also installed during renovation of certain properties 

in Japan during the year. This will be an ongoing effort undertaken as circumstances permit.

Our Lifestyle Division has limited ability to influence environmental, social and governance practices of its business 

associates. On the supply side, the division generally receives pre-packaged finished goods from brand-owners or 

vendors and has little say in the manufacture or packaging of such products. Manufacturers/brand-owners continue 

to adapt to present day consumer demand that leans towards environmentally-friendly products. Logistics partners 

for bulk shipments are generally appointed by the larger suppliers themselves with cost, margins and speed-to-market 

being major considerations in the choice of service provider. On the sales side, customer requirements generally prevail 

in relation to packaging and timing of delivery which then determines the shipment/delivery mode.

07

THAKRAL CORPORATION LTD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2018




At the operational level, we also generally adhere to some basic environment-friendly practices such as switching off 

lights and air-conditioning in rooms or spaces unoccupied during the work-day, powering down personal computers 

overnight, on weekends and on holidays, using recycled/EA-Eco printer toners, returning used photocopier toner 

cartridges for recycling in locations that support this, using PEFC/FSC certified paper (i.e., from sustainably managed 

forests, recycled and controlled sources) as well as disposing of used paper in a manner that enables recycling, etc. The 

Board has also implemented a Board meeting documents portal to go paperless and significantly reduce paper usage.

SOCIAL

We believe that employees are greatly responsible for the success of the Group. Hence, it is highly important to attract, 

retain and develop a high-quality workforce in order to maintain the operational excellence of the Group.

BOARD

STATEMENT

The Group continued its commitment towards supporting social and community causes to make a positive impact. 

Our China subsidiary, Thakral China Ltd had, through collaboration with Teng Chong Red Cross Society, provided 

donation in the form of school uniforms, computers, desk chairs, library books, bookcase, solar panels, sports items, 

etc as well as cash study grants for students to Liangying Wan Quan Primary School under the TuanTian Town Hope 

Project in Yunnan Province, China. This effort has directly benefited more than 120 students in the school.

Donations in kind of electronic products and computer accessories were also made to the ChickenSoup Foundation 

Limited, a grassroot philanthropic organisation in Hong Kong supported by working professionals to empower at-risk 

children in underprivileged communities in Hong Kong.

Locally, other than the usual cash donations to charitable organisations from time to time, cash donations were also 

made to (i) the Malay Youth Literary Association (4PM), a non-profit organisation to help the Malay community as 

well as the larger society to meet everyday challenges, to coincide with the celebration of their 70th anniversary and  

(ii) TODAY Enable Fund which aims to help people with disabilities fulfil their dreams and hopes and EduGrow which 

seeks to help underprivileged children break out of their low-income trap through intensive mentoring and education 

support, in conjunction with the Charity Book Launch for “Tall Order: The Goh Chok Tong Story”.

GOVERNANCE

The Group aims on building an ecosystem where high standards of corporate governance are upheld and best practices 

are applied business-wide. This not only contributes to the long-term growth of the business but also helps the business 

achieve its sustainability goals regionally. We strive to maintain integrity, transparency, accountability and discipline in 

all our practices and have put in place a robust governance framework to ensure we meet our objectives.

LOOKING AHEAD

Looking ahead, we hope to further improve our sustainability tracking, and continue building a sustainable business 

by placing more emphasis on the ESG factors. In this report, you will be provided with a balanced view of our position 

and performance with regard to some key issues and measures.

THAKRAL CORPORATION LTD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2018


The Group’s sustainability approach remains focused on value creation for all our stakeholders. The approach follows 

our sustainability policy which is to:

Sustainability is managed across the business through relevant policies, programs and operating procedures that 

are in place. These are shared with all employees of the Group, supported with training and well-defined roles and 

responsibilities. This guides the Management of the Group on its decision-making processes and ensures that we 

continually deliver on our business principles across all of our operations.

We employ a risk-based management approach. This involves reviewing our policies periodically, adjusting how we 

work in the event of any breach and reporting compliance.

We believe that to meet our sustainability goals and live by our values we need to integrate best practices into our 

day-to-day operations. Our aim is to contribute to local economies where we have a presence as well as to create a 

workplace that brings out the best in our employees. Most importantly, we want to build a sustainable business based 

on trust. We support the precautionary approach by taking actions to reduce environmental impact.

The Group is committed to integrating positive sustainability practices into our working environment and business 

processes. This is essential in order to deliver value to our business partners, foster trust with our communities, and 

ensure transparency and sustainable growth for our investors.

MARKET PRESENCE3

The prominent areas which the Lifestyle Division operates in is China and Hong Kong. However, the Group also has 

locally registered companies in Japan, India and Singapore. As the Japanese, Indian and Singaporean operations are not 

significant, these locations are not covered in this report. The international nature of our business encourages diversity 

in leadership and the Group believes that a good mix of international and local leadership is key to understanding and 

maximising market access.

Our market presence is based on consideration of issues such as scale of activity in markets, presence in product 

sectors and the relative risks and opportunities are determined as part of the strategy for entering a particular market. 

Market presence is subsequently considered based on the achievements and performance of the relevant unit.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE6

We strongly believe that compliance with environmental laws is crucial to ensure the business minimises any negative 

impact on the environment. Complying with environmental laws and using renewable energies also comes along with 

long term financial benefits and growth for the Group as there are various opportunities for the Group to receive 

government subsidies which further helps the division in improving its operations.

Within the GemLife business in the Investment Division, a review of of environmental conditions are taken for each 

unique project the Group onboards. This review consists of taking into consideration the impact of the development 

on existing land, nature or wildlife. Prior to the commencement of any site works, submissions are made to the local 

councils to obtain development approval. Moreover, opportunities are explored to create a development which utilises 

renewable energies, where possible. For example, solar panels are placed on house roofs to reduce the impact on the 

environment and also helps in reducing electricity costs.

To ensure that results are being achieved, constant monitoring and evaluation takes place. For example, external 

reviews are conducted in order to ensure that construction has been completed in accordance with with the approved 

development application. This tends to affirm that the construction results in a safe structure which complies with the 

local building legislation and does not negatively impact the environment.

Significant monetary and non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with  

environmental laws and/or regulations: NIL

EMPLOYMENT

The Group recognises the importance of attracting, retaining and developing a high-quality workforce in order to ensure

It employed a total of 231 employees as at 31 December 2018. The breakdown of our employee workforce based on 

geographical location and by gender demographics is as follows.

Figure 4: Number of employees for the Group

Given that employees are key to the Group’s growth, we aim to provide a safe and healthy working environment with 

development opportunity for them. The Group strongly believes in diversity and is conscious of ensuring a diverse range 

of employees. All employees are paid at or above the prescribed minimum wages where applicable.

Within TCAP (Investment Division in Australia), there is only a small number of staff, and there is minimal turnover. 

When it comes to GemLife within the Investment Division, it is currently still in the growth phase and additional staff 

are being hired. Within GemLife, there are a number of divisions, with a separate manager in charge of each of the 

divisions. To better manage their division and also to improve the skill sets of the managers to enhance operational 

efficiency, internal and external training is strongly encouraged where applicable. To ensure that the desired results 

are being achieved, the staff at GemLife are appraised of GemLife’s Human Resources Policy upon recruitment and 

receive an annual review including on performance and remuneration.

The Lifestyle Division being the more prominent division between the two requires a larger staff and is also expanding 

its operations to better serve its customers, thus necessitating the hiring of more people to match its needs. Moreover, 

the employees need to be skilled to contribute to the operational performance of the division in order to achieve long 

term growth.

Figure 5: New hires and employee turnover statistics for the Group

In the coming years, we will continue to ensure equal opportunity and improve the employee new hire rate within the 

Group. We will also manage employee turnover in the context of a tight and competitive talent market in China.

MARKETING AND LABELING

We believe that it is vital that the Lifestyle Division complies with all the rules and regulations related to advertising and 

labelling in each of the markets in which it operates.

Marketing is handled by the Group itself in places where the Group distributes products and it ensures that all 

marketing activities comply with the rules and regulations in the relevant country. Labelling in majority is not handled 

by the division; however, it ensures that the principal complies with the applicable rules and regulations in the country 

at product introduction as well as on an ongoing basis. The Group provides ongoing feedback to brand owners to 

ensure continued compliance with the relevant rules and regulations. The Group was able to achieve zero incidents of 

non-compliance concerning product and service information and labelling in FY2018.

In FY2019, we aim to maintain zero incidents of non-compliance concerning product and service information and 

labelling.

CUSTOMER PRIVACY

Protection, availability and integrity of both corporate and personal data, as well as appropriate use, are of crucial 

consideration to the Group as it determines the Group’s ability to conduct business, build trust and remain compliant 

with laws and regulations. Each time new personal information is obtained by the Group, it follows the necessary 

procedure for securely storing the data. It is the Group’s responsibility to protect the privacy of those who entrust it 

with their personal information. Our employees, suppliers, customers, consumers, and all those who do business with 

us trust and expect that we will protect information and remain compliant with legal requirements and our policies.

The Group’s Investment Division operates in the finance industry, and the legislation often requires certain information 

which is specific to its needs to be recorded and retained. The Group ensures that this information is safe and secure, 

as evidenced by zero complaints concerning breach of customer privacy and loss of customer data recorded at the 

Investment Division in FY2018. Data security is also important for the Lifestyle Division which also achieved zero cases 

of complaints/breaches.
