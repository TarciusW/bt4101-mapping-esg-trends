OUR BOARD’S MESSAGE 

[GRI 102-12, 14, 50, 52] 

Dear Stakeholders 

 

It is with utmost pleasure that we present to you Asia Vets Holdings Ltd. and its subsidiaries’ 

(“AVH” or the “Group”) inaugural annual Sustainability Report (“Report”) for the reporting period 

from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. Besides striving to be at the forefront of pet care 

in Singapore, one of the core values of the Group is to remain committed to be a trusted partner 

with professional ethics. This year, playing a more active role as a trusted partner, we have put 

together this Report to highlight our performance in the Economic, Environmental, Social and 

Governance (“EESG”) aspects. We have considered the sustainability issues as part of our 

strategic planning. The material EESG aspects are overseen and monitored by management 

of the Group. 

 

Subsequent to 31 December 2019, there has been a significant impact to the Singapore 

economy caused by the spread of COVID-19 (“COVID-19 outbreak”). As at the date of this 

Report, the Group has not experienced any adverse impact on our operations caused by the 

COVID-19 outbreak. However, the related impact to the performance of the Group for the rest 

of the year cannot be reliably estimated due to the uncertainty in the magnitude and duration 

of the impact to the veterinary sector caused by the COVID-

19 outbreak. Management will closely monitor the situation 

to initiate a tailored and measured approach to overcome 

any upcoming challenges caused by the COVID-19 

outbreak. 

 

We hope this Report will present you with greater insights to 

our sustainability performance and initiatives that we have 

taken.  

 

 

Tan Tong Guan 

Executive Chairman and CEO

This Report covers AVH’s approach towards the EESG factors deemed material to the Group.  

 

AVH has utilised the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards which are the most widely 

adopted global standards for sustainability reporting. This Report has been prepared in 

accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. No external assurance has been sought for 

this Report. 

 

As we seek to continually improve upon our sustainability efforts, any feedback is welcomed at

Headquartered in Singapore, the Group’s 

principal business activity is to provide 

veterinary services and sales of veterinary 

medicines 

and 

products 

through 

our 

subsidiary, AVH Animal Ark Pte Ltd. 

 

With our reputation of providing the highest 

level of pet care, equipped with experienced 

and competent team of staff, we are 

optimistic about our performance in the 

following years.

OUR EXPERTISE 

[GRI 102-2 4, 6, 7] 

The Group is proud to serve our customers for all pet related needs. Our veterinary clinics 

prides itself on its team of highly experienced and motivated animal healthcare professionals. 

AVH is currently operating three veterinary clinics in Singapore, with one of the outlets offering 

acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine (“TCM”). Our three veterinary clinics have a 

sturdy base of customers through quality service care and an established record in the 

performance of certain procedures such as endoscopy and laparoscopy. These services 

include the latest in surgical procedure, key-hole surgery as well as utilisation of natural killer 

cell and stem cell therapies in cancer treatments.  

 

Embracing a wider philosophy to wellbeing, we also offer veterinary acupuncture and TCM for 

a more holistic approach to health and healing for animals with conditions such as epilepsy, 

hepatitis, anaemia, arthritis and abdominal pains. The clinics also provide a comprehensive 

range of veterinary services which includes medical, surgical and dental care.  

 

Our Medical Director, Dr Eugene Lin, was among the first veterinarians to offer endoscopy and 

laparoscopy procedures. These minimally invasive surgical methods gained reputation due to 

its precision and smaller incisions on animals which could speed up the wound recovery 

process. The clinics also incorporated an interventional radiology which is a combination of the 

minimally invasive surgery techniques and fluoroscopy, which allow for real-time imaging of the 

small animals’ internal body structure.  

 

AVH also offers after-hours emergency 

hotline services which operates from 8pm to 

9am the following day and throughout public 

holidays.  

 

All cases are first screened and triaged by 

the duty veterinarian over the telephone. If 

required, the duty veterinarian will then meet 

the customers at the assigned clinic.

OUR PROMISE 

[GRI 102-16, 205-3] 

Our team is committed to educating our clients on how to keep their pets healthy all year round, 

with good nutrition and exercise. AVH stays on top of the latest advances in veterinarian 

technology and above all, remembers that all animals and pets need to be treated with loving 

care in every check-up, procedure, or surgery. 

 

Conflict of Interest 

To uphold the highest standards of 

corporate governance, the Group engages 

in responsible business practices and 

comply with applicable acts, laws, rules 

and regulations. All employees and 

governance body members are required to 

submit a Conflict of Interest Declaration as 

guided by AVH’s Conflict of Interest Policy.  

 

This 

ensures 

that 

employees’ 

and 

governance body members’ business 

judgement and decision making are not 

influenced by undue personal interests 

that creates a conflict of interest to the 

Group. The Group also requires its new 

suppliers to submit a Conflict of Interest 

Declaration prior to the start of their 

business relationship. Any activity that 

appears to present a conflict must be 

avoided 

or 

terminated 

unless 

management determines the activity is not 

harmful to the Group or otherwise 

improper. 

 

Bribery and Anti-corruption 

The Group is committed to the highest 

standards of ethical, moral and legal 

business conduct. AVH has adopted a zero-

tolerance approach to bribery and corruption. 

In line with this commitment to open 

communication 

and 

good 

corporate 

governance, the Group has implemented a 

Whistle-blowing 

Policy 

which 

provides 

employees and external parties with a 

platform to raise concerns in confidence on 

any wrongdoings, malpractices or possible 

irregularity within the Group. They are 

protected from reprisals or victimisation for 

whistle blowing in good faith and without 

malice. 

 

Our Whistle-blowing Policy is disseminated 

to all governance body members and 

employees which serve as a guideline in 

recognising and addressing any possible 

instances of corruption that they may face or 

witness. There have been no incidents of 

bribery or corruption reported during the 

reporting period.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY JOURNEY 

[GRI 102-18, 46] 

The Group has adopted the 4-step approach below to identify the relevant topics for reporting. 

 

In accordance with the GRI Standards, we applied the four reporting principles to decide which 

content to include in the Report by considering the Group’s activities, impacts, and the 

substantive expectation and interests of our stakeholders. 

 

Stakeholder Inclusiveness 

During the identification and prioritisation 

process, 

AVH 

had 

appointed 

a 

representative for each stakeholder group 

to 

participate 

in 

the 

focus 

group 

discussions.  

 

Materiality 

Identified factors are filtered during the 

prioritisation and validation process. This 

ensures that the factors reported are 

material and relevant to the Group. 

 

Sustainability Context 

In order to provide useful and comparative 

information that is relevant for the readers, 

AVH has included the topic boundaries to 

provide sustainability context. 

 

Completeness 

The Group ensures that the Report is 

complete by validating the material factors 

with senior management, as well as 

obtaining feedback from the stakeholders. 

 

• Feedback will 

be gathered 

for continual 

improvement 

of reporting.

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN 

[GRI 102-9, 11, 204-1] 

The Group strives to build a sustainable supply chain to seize value creation opportunities and 

offer significant competitive advantages. AVH engaged a total of 75 suppliers during the 

reporting period. Our vendors are mainly located in established countries with reliable medical 

care such as Singapore, Japan and the United States of America. This builds consumer 

confidence in the medical products used and sold at our clinics.  

 

The proportion of local spending in Singapore contributes to approximately 98% of the Group’s 

total expenditure during the reporting period. There are plenty of benefits from sourcing locally 

as compared to sourcing internationally. These include shorter delivery lead time and better 

communication with suppliers due to quicker response time. 

 

With 20 years of experience in the veterinary practice, Dr Eugene Lin regularly conducts 

lectures and workshops to share his knowledge with other local and overseas veterinary 

professionals. The lectures and workshops on endoscopy and laparoscopy not only aid in 

raising awareness and knowledge on the availability of such diagnostics, but it also helps the 

Group’s clinics in obtaining referrals from other veterinary clinics.  

 

 

 

 

 






 

 



 

12 

Decreasing 

Energy 

Consumption 

OUR ENVIRONMENT 

[GRI 302-1, 3, 307-1] 

At AVH, we each play our part to improve environmental sustainability through the reduction of 

energy consumption across our clinics. The Group did not identify any incidents on non-

compliance with environmental laws and regulations during the reporting period. 

 

 

 

 

 

The Group’s only significant form of energy consumed is electricity. In our efforts to conserve 

the environment, AVH utilises energy saving lights and air conditioners. Our medical equipment 

is only switched on when required during medical procedures or surgeries. 

 

During the reporting period, the Group consumed a total of 73,129kWh of electricity and 

reported a turnover of S$3.8 million. On average, 0.019kWh of energy was consumed for every 

dollar earned. The Group will continue to monitor our energy consumption and strive to reduce 

the energy usage in the next reporting period. 

 

 


 

 



 

13 

OUR PEOPLE 

[GRI 102-7 to 8, 401-1, 405-1, 406-1] 

The Group believes that our people are our greatest assets. We are committed to building a 

safe and positive environment for the physical and mental wellbeing of our employees. At the 

end of the reporting period, the Group reported a total employee strength of 20.  

 

 

 

Diversity and Non-discrimination 

 

 

 

 

During the reporting period, the Group’s employee hiring rate and turnover rate was 35%1 and 

25%1 respectively. Here at AVH, we believe in diversity. Regardless of gender, age and 

nationality, we provide our people with equal opportunities and employ them based on their 

merits. There have been no incidents of discrimination reported during the reporting period. 

 

1 We excluded a temporary staff with a one-month contract when computing the hiring rate and turnover rate.

OUR PEOPLE 

[GRI 404-1, 3] 

Professional Development 

In AVH, we strongly believe in continual learning, training and development for all. We 

encourage our employees to learn new skills and techniques to keep abreast with veterinary 

changes to provide quality care for our patients. This also aids the personal development of 

individual employees. All our new employees undergo a 3 months’ probation period during 

which their performance will be assessed. During the probation period, they are given on-the-

job training while shadowing a senior employee. This is to provide them with the opportunity to 

familiarise themselves with the operations. 

 

Apart from the on-site coaching by 

supervisors, AVH invests in external 

development 

courses 

for 

our 

employees. 

The 

Group 

provides 

funding support for our people to 

upgrade 

their 

professional 

competence. During the reporting 

period, the Group reported an average 

of 8.4 training hours per employee. 

 

Regular performance and career development reviews are conducted during our annual 

appraisals for all employees. This serves as a platform for AVH and employees to align 

corporate and individual goals to work towards the same objective. Together with clear 

individual development plans, we believe that effective motivation and encouragement 

enhances employee satisfaction, which correlates with improved organisation performance. 

 

AVH also works closely with Ngee Ann Polytechnic to match suitable individuals who are within 

three years of graduation to undergo structured training programme at our clinics. The Work-

Study Post-Diploma (“WSPostDip”), which is a SkillsFuture Work-Study Programme benefits 

the graduates as they undergo structured on-the-job training and mentorship at AVH. They also 

benefit from a well-structured career development pathway and guidance from mentors through 

our talent development plan.

OUR PEOPLE 

[GRI 102-11] 

Health and Safety 

In ensuring that there are no safety lapses at the clinics, employees are required to be skilled 

in handling equipment. On top of that, an in-depth understanding of medical procedures is also 

expected of employees. Any lapses from incompetency of employee may lead to undesirable 

consequences that may potentially put the animal being treated in danger.   

 

Employees may also be exposed to risks if policies and procedures are not closely observed 

during administration of treatments or surgeries on animals. Our employees handling any 

ionising irradiating apparatus must possess an L5 licence2. This licence is required for 

applicants intending to use, operate, energise or supervise the use of ionising radiation 

irradiating apparatus.  

 

With safety being our utmost priority, our clinics are staffed with skilled veterinary technicians 

who have at least 5 years of experience.

OUR CUSTOMERS 

[GRI 102-11, 416-2] 

AVH takes pride in the quality of our pet health care. The health, safety and wellbeing of our 

patients are of utmost importance to us. At AVH, we closely observe all regulations concerning 

health and safety of products and services that we offer. This is to ensure that we provide safe 

products and services to our customers.  

 

There are no instances of non-compliance to regulations concerning the health and safety 

impacts of products and services during the reporting period. 

 

In Safe Hands 

A selection of educational media has been provided to the public, on our subsidiary’s website, 

from the case notes of our Medical Director, Dr Eugene Lin. We hope to raise awareness of the 

enhanced clarity, safety and precision achieved via laparoscopy and endoscopy procedures. 

This aids the owners of the pets (who are our customers) to better understand the surgical 

procedures to be performed and thereby putting them at ease. 

 

We seek to reassure the owners that their pets are in safe hands. As such, AVH operates as 

an open clinic. This means that our team welcomes owners to observe their pets during any 

medical procedure, whether a simple vaccination or a complex surgery. 

 

 

 

 

 

 





My pet 'posh' is a 17-year-old Labrador and 

she owes her long, healthy life to the care 

and concern shown by this amazing place. 

It’s not a vet clinic, more of a community 

that loves animals…

OUR CUSTOMERS 

[GRI 418-1, 419-1] 

Safeguarding Customer Privacy 

Preserving and protecting customer data and privacy against any losses or breaches has 

always been our top priority. The Group complies with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 

(“PDPA”) to ensure that our customers’ privacy are safeguarded. We did not receive any 

complaints regarding any breaches of customer privacy during the reporting period.  

 

Social and Economic Laws and Regulations 

It is in our best interest to aim towards an all sustainable operations. This includes the social 

aspect of sustainability which concerns the impacts we impose on social systems. We place 

emphasis on socioeconomic compliance in our operations. There have been no reports on non-

compliance of socioeconomic laws and regulations during the reporting period.  

 

AVH is a committed partner whose main aim is to deliver highest level of care and 

professionalism. We always look towards fulfilling the needs and expectations of our customers 

and stakeholders.  

 

Taking precautionary measures in our business operations is very vital to ensure that we are 

fully aware of possible risks or side effects in any scientific administration to animals. Especially 

in our operations of evaluating and administering veterinary medicines and products to animals, 

it is essential that we uphold our precautionary principles.  

 

Giving back 

In AVH, we believe in giving back. Everyone has a role to play in making positive changes to 

the world. Whether in the social aspect or environmental aspect, all efforts matter. Here at AVH, 

we are actively involved in supporting the community through various Corporate Social 

Responsibility (“CSR”) efforts. Apart from free talks given by our Medical Director, Dr Eugene 

Lin, to pet owners at pet events to raise the importance of regular health checks and dental 

hygiene, preferential rates are also given to dogs who have been adopted from Save Our Street 

Dogs (“SoSD”).
