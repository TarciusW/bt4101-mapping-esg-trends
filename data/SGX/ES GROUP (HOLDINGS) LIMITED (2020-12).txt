OUR LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS

OUR LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS 

Dear Stakeholders,  

The COVID-19 pandemic is currently the 

focus of public attention. It has a 

significant impact on the life of people 

around the world and sharply slowed 

down global economic activity. As a 

result of the COVID-19 pandemic, 

companies are seeing the need to have 

a comprehensive business continuity 

plan to build a sustainable business that 

remain resilient amidst adversity. 

Ever since the establishment of ES 

Group 

(Holdings) Limited and 

its 

subsidiaries in 1975, our vision and 

mission that have been instilled in us for 

over 45 years have brought us far, and 

even through tough times like previous 

downturns in the offshore and marine 

industry. In order to strengthen and to 

build a more sustainable business, we 

carefully consider environmental, social 

and governance (“ESG”) issues in all our 

strategic and investment decisions. 

We seek to deliver steady value growth 

in our new building and repair segment, 

as well as our shipping segment through 

innovative supply chain solutions and 

sustainable 

long-term 

partnerships. 

Together with our management, our 

Board has determined the material ESG 

risks as well as the opportunities that are 

important steps to our Group’s long-

term success.  

Our core business in the new building 

and repair segment remains a significant 

aspect of our Group’s operations. This 

industry is highly labour intensive. Our 

people are thus the most valuable 

resource. We are committed to invest in 

people development to grow the 

capabilities of our workforce and 

continue 

creating 

value 

for 

our 

stakeholders. Safety is the core value at 

ES Group. We are committed to safety 

and training for our workers and we 

strive for a “Zero Accident” goal in the 

shipyards. 

Amid 

the 

COVID-19 

pandemic, the health and well-being of 

our employees and other stakeholders 

have been our top priority. We have put 

in place various safe management 

measures 

in 

accordance 

to 

the 

prevailing regulations, orders, advisories 

and 

guidelines 

issued 

by 

the 

Government in order to curb the spread 

of the virus. 

Our shipping segment continues to be a 

significant segment for reporting as it 

contributed to 30.6% of our Group’s 

revenue in 2020. Being part of the 

shipping industry, our Group is aware of 

the carbon emission damage and hopes 

that ongoing efforts in reducing carbon 

footprint 

will 

contribute 

towards 

international efforts to tackle climate 

change, given that over 90% of all global 

trades are carried out by ships1.  

As the world moves towards a lower 

emission future, our Group continues to 

support 

fully 

the 

decision 

of 

International Maritime Organisation 

(IMO) to implement a 0.5% sulphur cap 

(down from 3.5%) for marine fuels in an 

effort to reduce the amount of sulphur 

oxide, from 1 January 2020 (“IMO 

2020”). In view of this, our Group has 

switched from using heavy marine fuel 

oil to low sulphur fuel oil since 

November 2019 for our vessel, ES 

Aspire, to be in compliance with IMO 

2020 as we strongly believe in “cleaner 

shipping for cleaner air”.   

This is the fourth year that our Group 

has 

been 

publishing 

sustainability 

reports, 

since 

our 

inaugural 

sustainability report for 2017, which was 

published in November 2018. We have 

taken into consideration feedbacks on 

our past sustainability reports and this 

edition adopts a more structured and 

detailed 

explanation 

of 

our 

sustainability policies and efforts. 

Sustainability 

is 

a 

collective 

responsibility 

that 

involves 

every 

individual. We believe by continuous 

collaboration 

with 

each 

of 

our 

stakeholders, we could create a more 

sustainable operation in every aspect of 

our Group. We hope that this report will 

communicate our efforts to a broader 

audience, not only to spur us to build an 

enduring and high performing business, 

but also to ensure we continue to 

commit towards greener planet. 

Join us in our Voyage into Sustainability.

On Behalf of the Board of Directors

LOW CHEE WEE

Stakeholders 

of 

the 

Company 

(“Stakeholders”) referred in this report 

are various groups of people who uses 

this report, alongside with the Annual 

Report of the Company, which is 

published 

separately, 

to 

garner 

information on our sustainability efforts 

and the relevant risks, impacts, and 

opportunities arising from the relevant 

sustainability elements. Stakeholders 

include our shareholders, customers, 

suppliers, employees and government, 

as detailed below.

We reach out to the Stakeholders by 

means of published documents on our 

website and on the Singapore Exchange 

(“SGX”) website.  

Stakeholders working within the Group 

are free to contact us using the 

established reporting lines or whistle 

blowing 

procedures, 

whereas 

Stakeholders outside the Group can 

reach out to us via our contact details 

listed in our website or under the 

section “Our Reporting Basis” of this 

report.

The Group does not have an active 

engagement approach such as surveys 

and discussions group, as the Group is 

still in the process of maturing its 

Sustainability Report and its topics and 

factors (refer to the section “Our 

Sustainability Topics” of this report) 

before we are able to have a meaningful 

and fruitful engagement with our 

Stakeholders.

Shareholders 



Shareholders play an important role in the control, financing, and governance of the Group’s business. Shareholders are 

concerned with the going concern of the Group and the maximisation of returns on the capital they have invested. The 

Group’s commitment to a sustainable operation is their utmost interest as we continue to strive for excellence in alignment 

of their interest.

Customers



In line with the Group’s Vision and Mission, we believe that meeting customers’ satisfaction and excellence in quality will 

provide the best basis to retain customers and ensure a sustainable operation. 

Suppliers



Strong and effective relationships with our suppliers give our business better strategic advantages, which includes access 

to resources, greater supplier support, and lower costs. Suppliers will be interested in our financial performance in terms 

of payment ability so as to decide on the continuance of our working relationship in the long run. 

Employees 



As a labour-intensive operation with a huge labour force, the Group focuses on human resource related policies (e.g. merit-

based and non-discriminatory recruitment; grievance procedures), competitive remuneration condition and the safety of 

our employees, which are crucial factors for attracting and retaining the best employees, and employees’ motivation and 

commitment to the Company. 

Government



The relevant statutory boards of the Government will be interested in how we have imposed relevant internal controls and 

processes to ensure that all applicable laws and regulations have been adhered to.

OUR COMMITMENT TO A SUSTAINABLE OPERATION 

For the past 40 over years, we have 

been a quality driven service provider in 

the offshore and marine industry 

committed to uphold a high level of 

customers’ satisfaction. Along the 

journey, we have recognised that the 

Group’s activities have a broad impact 

on the social, environmental, and 

financial aspects within the Group and 

outside the Group. Hence, we are 

committed 

to 

work 

with 

the 

Stakeholders 

to 

address 

all 

sustainability concerns – minimising the 

unfavourable 

impact 

and 

taking 

advantage 

of 

the 

favourable 

opportunities – with our vision and 

mission governing our operation.  

Voyaging into Sustainability 

We 

have 

published 

our 

first 

Sustainability Report (for the financial 

year ended 31 December 2017) in 

November 

2018, 

driven 

by 

the 

requirement of SGX Catalist Rules, 

which marks our first embarkation to 

the road of sustainability. 

In 2021, the fourth publication of our 

Sustainability Report (for the financial 

year ended 31 December (“FY”) 2020) 

was updated, aiming at improving the 

quality of the report in terms of 

compliance (refer to the section “Our 

Reporting Basis” of this report for 

more information), depth, relevance, 

and understandability.  

We believe that the driver for 

sustainability must first start from a 

sound 

and 

effective 

Corporate 

Governance that propagates across 

each function of our Group, which we 

will detail further below.

Management Approach 

The board of directors of the Company 

(the “Board” or the “Directors”) and  

management of the Company (the 

“Management”) believe that it is 

important to establish good corporate 

governance within the Group as this 

provides the foundation for a well-

managed, sustainable and efficient 

organisation. This can in turn sustain 

good 

business 

performance 

and 

safeguard 

the 

interests 

of 

the 

Stakeholders. The Board is committed 

to continually develop and uphold high 

standards of corporate governance, 

guided by the principles and guidelines 

of the Singapore Code of Corporate 

Governance 2018 (the “Code”) issued 

by 

the 

Monetary 

Authority 

of 

Singapore. A full detailed Corporate 

Governance Report can be found in the 

Company’s Annual Report 2020 pages 

19 to 48. 

Whistle-Blowing 

Whistle-blowing policies have been in 

place 

since 

2010. 

The 

Group 

encourages employees to report in 

good faith and in confidence, without 

fear of reprisals, concerns about 

possible 

improprieties 

in 

financial 

reporting or other matters to the 

chairman of the Audit and Risk 

Committee. 

Reportable 

conducts 

include, but are not limited to, fraud, 

corruption, illegality, safety violations, 

and 

serious 

misconduct 

that 

contravene the procedures set by the 

Group that may lead to legal action 

and/or losses for the Group. Losses can 

include financial losses, non-financial 

losses, and tarnish of reputation of the 

Group.  

Whistle-blowing policy and whistle-

blowing reports received (if any), will be 

assessed by the Audit and Risk 

Committee for appropriate action. 

No incident of reportable misconducts 

occurred during FY2020.

Sustainability Management 

Sustainability matters are managed by 

the 

Compliance 

Committee 

(“Committee”). The Committee, was 

first set up in 2010 to implement and 

review 

the 

effectiveness 

of 

the 

compliance framework of the Group 

with the SGX Catalist Rules, compliance 

with 

legislation 

and 

regulations 

imposed by the relevant authorities, as 

well as the liaison with professional 

advisors on all corporate documents 

and actions (e.g. announcements, 

circulars, etc.). 

The Committee also spearheads and 

manages all sustainability management 

matters, aligned with the requirements 

imposed by the SGX Catalist Rules, 

which includes: 

 Setting the direction of the Group’s 

sustainability efforts. 

 Identifying 

and 

reviewing 

the 

sustainability factors. 

 Reporting the identified factors to the 

Board at least once annually. 

 Reporting 

identified 

factors 

as 

relevant to Stakeholders via the 

published sustainability report. 

The Committee reports to the Audit and 

Risk Committee.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS

OUR SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS 

Our Assessment Processes 

Sustainability topics primarily revolve 

around the operational aspects of our 

business, and are inherent factors 

arising from within the Group. They are 

deemed material to either impact our 

businesses if these factors are poorly 

managed or will have a direct impact on 

our Stakeholders in their decision-

making processes, or on the economic, 

environmental, and social factors of 

using our products and services.  

Other factors include external factors 

outside the Group (such as political 

development internationally or locally, 

socio-economic factors, environmental 

issues, and so on) where these factors 

will have material impact over the 

Group’s 

operational 

performance, 

economically or socially. 

As introduced in the section “Our 

Corporate Profile” in this report, our 

operations are separated into two main 

segments. 

In 

the 

application 

of 

materiality for the identification of 

material sustainable topics, we looked 

into these two main segments and their 

presence in the various geographical 

locations where the operations of the 

respective segments are. We further 

identify whether the operations are 

significant to focus in the scope of our 

reporting. 

We then proceed to identify the 

material Sustainability Topics at a 

broad level, as presented in the 

Material Topic Matrix (see Table 2). 

The accompanying risks, impacts and 

opportunities 

factors 

under 

each 

Sustainability 

Topic 

(“Sustainability 

Factors”) 

are 

then 

assigned 

and 

presented in the following Identified 

Sustainability Factors Table (see Table 

3). 

Most of our Sustainability Topics 

revolve around the new building and 

repair segment as it is the core business 

of the Group. The Group continuously 

assess, based on events occurring both 

internally and externally, information 

and 

feedbacks 

received 

from 

Stakeholders, 

the 

relevance 

and 

materiality of each Sustainability Topic 

and Factors and shall report based on 

the 

latest 

relevant 

material 

Sustainability Topics and Factors. 

Specific 

management 

approach 

is 

further detailed in each Sustainability 

Topic. 

Changes to Sustainability Topics 

In response to SGX expectations for 

COVID-19 related disclosures, we have 

set out our plans and strategies to 

recover from the COVID-19 pandemic 

under the Safety and Health topic in this 

report. 

We have also reassessed our material 

Sustainability Topics and Sustainability 

Factors but no changes have been made 

to 

the 

Sustainability 

Topics 

and 

Sustainability Factors from last year 

report.

Management approach

Our core business is a manpower-centric operation, and this reflects the importance 

in maintaining a healthy workforce and a safe working environment. High accident 

rate in the shipyard will reflect a risky work environment with unacceptable human 

costs and may impact morale and the confidence of the workers. It will also expose 

the Group to potential litigation as well as fines from authorities. 

We are devoted in maintaining a healthy workforce and a safe working environment 

through the efforts detailed below, and further testified and audited with the 

attainment of ISO 45001:2018 and BizSAFE Star. 

HEALTH AND SAFETY OF 

WORKERS 

Accidents are unforeseeable events and 

may 

not 

be 

entirely 

avoidable. 

Nonetheless the Group aims to achieve 

a ‘Zero Accident’ goal with adopted 

measures such as educating workers 

and implementing accident preventive 

procedures. Further initiatives include 

inculcating a ‘Safety First’ mindset to all 

workers on the ground as well as having 

an adequate number of safety officers 

on board vessels to supervise and 

ensure safety regulations are followed 

by workers. 

Safety starts from every individual, and 

that is where inculcating a ‘Safety First’ 

mindset is the utmost importance in 

achieving a ‘Zero Accident’ goal. This is 

done by emphasising safety matters 

during daily and weekly site briefings, 

putting up safety information posters 

around the site as well as implementing 

punitive system to penalise workers 

who 

knowingly 

breach 

safety 

regulations. During lunch time, workers 

are allowed to take a nap to recharge 

and remain alert for the remaining of 

the day. 

To further encourage individuals to be 

responsible for their own safety and 

people around them, the Group awards 

top performers during our annual Safety 

Award Presentation to recognise the 

efforts put in by individuals. All workers 

are appraised individually by the 

Department Manager based on their 

safety knowledge, number of safety 

infringements, number of accidents and 

incidents, 

proficiency 

in 

material 

handling, and so on. Top performing 

workers are then selected and awarded 

a Certificate of Recognition for the 

outstanding performance in Workplace 

Safety and Health for the year.  

Another level of safeguard over safety is 

by stationing safety officers on board 

vessels to supervise and ensure safety 

regulations are followed by crew and 

workers. Supervisors working on board 

will provide an additional pair of eyes on 

safety. The Group ensures both the 

safety officers and supervisors are 

adequately trained and updated by 

sending them to courses (e.g. Shipyard 

safety induction course). 

Our commitment to achieve a ‘Zero 

Accident’ goal is further demonstrated 

with 

the 

achievement 

of 

safety 

certification ISO 45001:2018 and BizSafe 

Star. Annual audit is required to ensure 

that safety procedures are intact and 

followed before certifications can be 

renewed.

Safe Working Environment 

Injury statistics as seen in Tables 4 to 6 

are data tabulated from the new 

building and repair segment in the 

shipyard in Singapore for the Group, 

and consists wholly of our own male 

employees 

(females 

non-executive 

holds administrative roles in the offices 

– refer to the section “Employment 

Practices 

– 

Diversification 

of 

Workforce” in this report for more 

information) in the shipyard. No third 

parties’ workers are engaged. 

The categories of injury are defined 

below: 

 First Aid Injury (FAI): Incidents that 

require first aid treatment and are 

considered minor. The worker will 

be able to work as per normal. 

 Non-lost 

Time 

Injury 

(NLTI) 

Restricted Work Days Case (RWDC):

Injury that are moderately light but 

require more medical attention as 

compared to FAI. According to 

doctor’s 

instructions 

/ 

recommendations, the worker will 

still be able to work on the day of 

incident, but on work that are 

deemed to be light duty and will not 

aggravate his injury further. 

 Lost Time Injury (LTI): Any work-

related injury or illness which 

prevents an employee from doing 

any work after an incident and / or 

being hospitalised, but is not within 

the scope of Lost Time Accident 

below. 

 Lost 

Time 

Accident 

(LTA):

A 

recordable incident whereby an 

employee is not able to return to 

work or is assigned restricted work 

on the day following the incident 

and / or hospitalised. ‘Recordable’ is 

determined by a medical leave of 

more than 3 days, or hospitalisation 

for more than 24 hours. 

The Group has seen a decrease in the 

Incident Frequency Rate from 6 cases 

per million man-hours in 2019 to 4 

cases per million man-hours in 2020. 

This was mainly due to the decrease in 

number of cases of NLTI and LTI, which 

translated to an Incident Severity Rate 

of 48 man-days lost per million man-

hours in 2019, as compared to 27 man-

days lost per million man-hours in 

2020. The number of LTA cases remains 

at 1 in both 2020 and 2019. 

The Group continues to strive towards 

‘Zero Accident’ goal and targets to cap 

the number of LTA cases in 2021 at zero 

case and the IFR, ISR and ODR to be 

capped at 5 cases per million man-

hours, 20 man-days lost per million 

man-hours and zero case per million 

man-hours, respectively. 

All safety accidents must be reported to 

the safety officer. In an event of a 

workplace injury, the worker is required 

to report directly to the immediate 

supervisor on the incident or accident. 

The supervisor will then immediately 

report to the safety officer with details 

on how the incident or accident 

occurred, the exact time and location, 

and the injury sustained by the worker 

during the incident or accident.

For prompt medical attention, workers 

are 

directed 

to 

nearby 

general 

practising medical clinics and private 

hospitals, in addition to government 

hospitals. In compliance to the local 

foreign worker legislation, workers are 

covered with the necessary insurance 

policies. 

Safe Living and Working Environment 

Majority of our workers in the shipyard 

stays in the dormitory, which includes 

rented dormitory (approved by Ministry 

of Manpower) as well as our own 

dormitory. For rented dormitory, rules 

and regulations are imposed by the 

landlord to ensure that the dormitory is 

kept in healthy and liveable conditions. 

The 

onus 

of 

the 

creation 

and 

maintenance of a healthy and safe living 

environment for our own dormitory lies 

in our hand.  

We have imposed rules and regulations 

on all workers living in our dormitory 

and ensure that all workers abide by 

them to maintain a healthy and safe 

living environment. Serious offences 

such as display of violence, indecent 

behaviour, gambling, shoplifting, drug 

abuse and money lending activity shall 

result in eviction of the workers from 

the dormitory. Other offences, such as 

smoking 

at 

undesignated 

area, 

indiscriminate parking of bicycles, 

failure to hang clothes on assigned 

racks, failure to tidy personal area and 

improper disposal of rubbish, attract 

fines. Spot checks by supervisors and 

human resource staff are conducted at 

random so as to ensure that rules and 

regulations are adhered to, where 

punitive measures are imposed against 

workers in breach of the rules and 

regulations. 

We have also, in line with Building and 

Construction Authority’s rules and 

regulations, Ministry of Manpower 

Occupational Safety and Health (“OSH”) 

regulations as well as ISO 45001:2018, 

implemented an Operational Control 

Procedure (“OCP”). The OCP detailed 

the following: 

 Responsibility 

to 

the 

relevant 

parties in the Emergency Response 

Team (“ERT”). 

 Identification, 

assessment, 

and 

prevention of OSH Emergencies 

Risks. 

 Emergency response protocol in the 

event of an emergency. 

 Site 

clean-up 

and 

follow-up 

protocol. 

The OCP is applicable to the workshop, 

office and dormitory (all situated at the 

same location at 10 Kwong Min Road) 

owned by the Group, in which it is 

extended to all personnel working at 

the workshop and office, a tenant 

renting partial of the workshop space, 

and workers staying in the dormitory. 

The effectiveness of the emergency 

response protocol is assessed every 

year 

by 

carrying 

out 

Emergency 

Evacuation Drill (the “Drill”). Due to the 

COVID-19 pandemic, the Drill for 

FY2020 was delayed to 13 January 

2021. Notwithstanding the delay, the 

Drill was conducted efficiently and 

successfully in accordance to the OCP, 

where all company personnel and 

tenants were accounted for at the 

muster point within 17 minutes from 

the start of the Drill. 

Global warming and safety  

Global warming has been affecting the 

whole world where extreme changes 

to the weather can be observed around 

the globe. 

In Singapore, we are observing higher 

temperatures 

and 

intense 

heat, 

accompanied by erratic thunderstorms. 

These expose our workers in our core 

business working in shipyards on board 

vessels to higher risk of heat injury and 

lightning risks arising from erratic 

thunderstorms. 

Safety officers are tasked to ensure that 

the workers, including themselves, are 

protected 

against 

such 

weathers. 

Workers exposed to intense heat are 

given frequent breaks to properly 

hydrate and cool themselves to prevent 

heat injury, and in the case of wet 

weather, workers on board will be 

evacuated 

from 

open 

space 

to 

sheltered areas.

COVID-19 measures and recovery 

plans 

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a 

significant impact globally, especially to 

the marine and offshore industry that 

we are operating in, where the 

operation is highly labour intensive with 

a huge labour force working in close 

physical proximity with 

one and 

another and in enclosed spaces. In 

order to provide a safe working 

environment 

for 

employees 

and 

prevent the spread of COVID-19, we

which 

can 

be 

summarised to those applied to office 

staffs and those applied to shipyard 

workers. 

For office staffs 

• Staffs are required to reduce 

physical interaction and maintain 

social distancing at workplace. 

• Staffs are required to wear a mask at 

all 

times 

and 

maintain 

good 

hygiene. 

• Staffs and visitors are required to 

use SafeEntry to check in/out when 

arriving/leaving the office. 

• Staffs are required to take their 

body temperature twice daily. They 

are also required to leave the office 

immediately and see a doctor if 

their temperature is too high. 

• Staffs are allowed to work from 

home where applicable. 

• Shorten working hours so that staffs 

can avoid to travel during peak hour, 

especially for those commuting to 

work by public transport.

• Reduce physical meetings by having 

all meetings to be conducted by 

electronic means if applicable. 

For shipyard workers 

• A system of Safe Management 

Measures (SMM) at worksites has 

been 

implemented. 

Detailed 

monitoring plan is laid out in a 

handbook which gives detailed 

outline 

of 

Safe 

Management 

Measures 

implemented 

to 

all 

operations and activities so as to 

minimize the risk of COVID-19 

spread within the Company and 

promote 

a 

safe 

working 

environment for employees. It also 

identifies potential risks and non-

compliance 

to 

the 

Safe 

Management Team and introduces 

corrective action. 

• Pre-screening and segregation of 

teams to reduce physical interaction 

and ensure safe distancing at 

worksite. Before entering work site, 

workers have to take the required 

swab test, being identified as 

"Green" and approved by EDB. Even 

after returning to work site, workers 

are required to go for swab test 

every 2 weeks. We have a total of 

319 workers working in shipyards, of 

which 163 were tested positive for 

COVID-19 virus and have since fully 

recovered. As at the date of this 

report, majority of all our workers 

(316) have returned to work, except 

for 3 workers who have returned to 

their home country for holidays. 

• In order to support contract tracing, 

all 

workers 

are 

required 

to 

download 

and 

active 

the 

TraceTogether software application. 

Workers and visitors must declare 

via SafeEntry or other means 

permitted 

by 

the 

government 

before the person is allowed to 

enter the premises. 

• Regular temperature screening are 

conducted twice daily on the 

workers. 

• Workers are required to reduce 

physical interaction and ensure safe 

distancing at worksites. 

• All onsite personnel and workers are 

required to wear masks and other 

necessary 

personal 

protective 

equipment at all times. We will 

ensure that sufficient masks are 

provided to all workers. 

• Any worker who is feeling unwell or 

showing symptoms of illness should 

report to his superior, leave the 

workplace and consult a doctor 

immediately. 

• Workers are required to observe 

good personal hygiene e.g. wash 

their hands regularly and refrain 

from touching their face. 

There are 3 dormitories that are 

currently being occupied 

by our 

shipyard 

workers, 

Aluania 

Lodge 

(rented), woodlands dormitory (rented) 

and 10 Kwong Min Road (Company 

owned). Some modifications have been 

made to the dormitory at 10 Kwong Min 

Road to ensure safe distancing to curb 

the spread of COVID-19. The building at 

10 Kwong Min Road has 2 floors, of 

which the first floor is used as office, 

while the second floor is used as 

dormitory. The modifications include 

but not limited to the following: 

• Inserted a board to break dormitory 

to 2 blocks, Block A and Block B to 

prevent interactions between Block 

A and Block B. So that if workers at 

Block A infected, workers at Block B 

won't be affected. 

• Created an isolation room of 8 beds 

and bought 2 mobile toilets for 

isolation purpose. 

• Created new washing point for 

workers to come back to wash their 

hand and boots before entering the 

dormitory. 

The list above is not exhaustive, and 

such modifications are part of the 

precautionary measures implemented 

by the Company. As we are resident 

contractors and common contractors in 

the Marine Shipyard Sector, we are 

required to also adhere to a list of 

COVID-Safe Restart Criteria issued by 

EDB and Enterprise Singapore before 

the Company can resume its business 

activities. Even though close to full 

force of the Company's employees and 

workers have resumed to work, we 

continue to ensure compliance with the 

relevant safe management measures. 

Compared to past crises, the COVID-19 

pandemic has had a more severe 

economic impact. As the COVID-19 

pandemic continues to impact people 

and economies around the world, full 

recovery from COVID-19 could be a long 

journey ahead. With the support from 

Singapore government, especially in 

monetary term through job support 

scheme, foreign worker levy rebate, 

rental relief etc., it definitely has eased 

the Company's financial burden for the 

business to carry on. Despite huge 

uncertainty 

about 

how 

long 

the 

recovery process would take, the 

Management is ready to lead the team 

to adapt to the changing environment 

so as to rebound stronger.

 Assessed and confirmed 

Sustainability Factors identified in

 Update information for 

Sustainability Factors 

Continue to assess the validity of the 

Sustainability Factors and the 

information contained therein. 

Management Approach 

As our core business function relies heavily on manpower, labour practices in managing both employees’ welfare and 

development, labour supply and costs affected by macro-factors such as inter-country relationship, and fair and equal 

employment practices have a direct impact on the sustainability of our operation, in terms of the costs of our operations and 

the employees’ job fulfilment. The Group aims to create a working culture that is fair, equal, inclusive, diverse, and free from 

any form of discrimination.  

EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES 

The first step to achieving the ideal work 

culture is to have a sound system of 

employment policy. Such policy includes 

care of the responsible hiring and fair 

compensation commensurate with non-

bias and commonly accepted indicators 

and rights of employees. 

Work-life balance 

The Group understands the importance 

for our employees to strike a balance 

between their work commitment and 

their personal life. We provide a certain 

degree of flexibility by supporting their 

need to apply urgent leave to take care of 

their personal matters, particularly to 

family related matters, or pre-approved 

tweak in their work schedule to enable 

them to pick their children or go for night 

classes for skill upgrade courses. 

The Group also adheres to the applicable 

employment 

legislation 

to 

provide 

paternal, maternal and childcare leave for 

employees to take care of their children 

as and when required. 

Fair compensation and benefits 

The Group commits to compensating our 

employees fairly and commensurate with 

employees’ position and experience, free 

from any discrimination. Employee’s 

compensation 

in 

Singapore 

is 

not 

subjected to minimum wages. Employees 

are also given benefits and compensation 

for overtime work prescribed by the 

applicable 

employment 

law 

and 

regulations. 

Rights of employees 

The Group does not currently have any 

policy to either advocate or restrict rights 

of our employees to associate freely, 

engage 

in 

collective 

bargaining, 

participate in trade / labour union, as well 

as seek representation as long as it is 

permitted by the governing law and 

regulations. There is no collective 

bargaining agreement for employees in 

the Group. 

In any event of significant operational 

changes that affects an employee, the 

employee will be notified at least one 

month in advance for them to have the 

necessary preparation. 

Ethical and responsible hiring 

The 

Group 

practises 

ethical 

and 

responsible hiring. We do not practice 

nor accept any hiring of any persons that 

are either below the prescribed legal 

working 

age 

by 

the 

governing 

employment law and regulation of the 

country our operations are present 

(known subsequently as “child labour”) 

and the hiring of persons that are 

unwilling, forced, bonded, or other forms 

of compulsory forced labour that goes 

against the will and the natural course of 

the accepted norm of an employment 

process. 

In 

Singapore, 

employments, 

where 

applicable, 

are 

approved 

and/or 

submitted to the respective Government 

authorities overlooking labour matters. 

This ensure that employees are of legal 

age and protected by the employment 

legislation which forbids child, forced and 

compulsory labour. 

We aim to ensure that our suppliers do 

their part in respect to their employees’ 

rights 

and 

practice 

ethical 

and 

responsible 

hiring 

through 

efforts 

detailed in Supply Chain Management. 

The Group has not been subject to human 

rights review or human rights impact 

assessment at any geographical location 

of which we operate in. 

DIVERSIFICATION OF WORKFORCE 

An inclusive and diverse working culture 

requires an employment policy that 

accepts people of all backgrounds and 

not based on prejudicial selection.  

The Group understands the importance 

and benefits of having a diversified 

workforce, which includes: 

• Macro-factors relating to labour 

policy and relationship between 

Singapore 

and 

other 

countries, 

affecting supply of labour and the 

associated cost. By recruiting workers 

of different nationality, this

prevents over-reliance on one or 

two nationality group(s) and 

mitigate 

the 

impact 

on 

unfavourable 

labour 

changes 

resulting from changes to labour 

policy and relationship between 

Singapore and the said countries. 

 •  Socio-factor where workers learn 

how to interact, work and live with 

people of different ethnic groups 

and nationalities while working, 

and also adapting to the society 

outside work. This enable workers 

to be able to adapt and live in a 

cosmopolitan 

nation 

like 

Singapore. 

• People from different location, 

coming from different culture, can 

propagate different positive work 

habits and input creative solutions 

to tackle challenges.

• Reduce the chance of possible 

powering 

of 

one 

particular 

nationality, ethnic or religious 

group. 

For safety and work efficiency, the 

Management recognises that language 

and especially language barriers are 

important factors to be considered in 

hiring and work team grouping. 

It is the Group’s policy to be open in the 

recruitment of persons of different 

background (e.g. gender, nationality, 

age and so on) for all positions 

(including office positions).  

Our challenges in diversification of 

workers 

lies 

on 

the 

gender 

diversification, where the bulk of our 

workforce in the core business is nature 

of work in the shipyard demanding 

physical strength and exposure to the 

hot sun as well as the already male-

dominated environment that female 

would normally refrain themselves 

from applying. 

All employees are permanent and full-

time staff during the years 2020 and 

2019.

Please refer to Tables 7 to 10 for the 

information on the diversity of our 

workforce.

OUR LABOUR PRACTICES

CAREER DEVELOPMENT 

Attracting and retaining talents is an 

important step in achieving the ideal 

work culture.  

Furthermore, our reliance on skilled 

personnel (such as heavy equipment 

operators, 

draughtsmen, 

welders, 

grinders, etc) is unavoidable. Skilled 

personnel 

with 

the 

appropriate 

experiences 

and/or 

requisite 

certifications in our industry are limited 

and competition for such personnel is 

intense. Hence, there is a need to 

continue to retain the skilled personnel 

that we have trained.  

Therefore, 

we 

believe 

in 

the 

development of our workers and this is 

in line with our mission. We send our 

employees for training not just for 

single trade but multiple trades so that 

workers can be re-deployed whenever 

reshuffling of workforce is required.  

This give them a sense of job 

satisfaction, personal development and 

enhance job security and employability 

of each employee, which we hope will 

inspire greater intrinsic value within 

themselves. 

This policy also enables us to be less 

reliance on the external labour market, 

improve efficiency and quality in the 

work produced by the workers, as well 

as give workers the opportunity to 

develop and excel within the Group. 

Furthermore, 

all 

employees 

are 

subjected to performance review, 

regardless of employment category or 

gender and without prejudice. These 

performance reviews are conducted on  

an annual basis where employees’  

performance during the year are 

assessed. Through these appraisals,  

Management can identify areas for 

development of each employee’s skill 

set. 

New hire and turnover of employees 

Despite the efforts stated above to 

retain our skilled workers, the Group 

practices lean cost management (since 

2015) by managing and restructuring 

our headcount to align with the 

demand in the marine, oil and gas 

industries. The employee turnover and 

hire rates are expected to stabilise as 

the market stabilises. Please refer to 

Tables 11 to 12 for the data on new hire 

and turnover of employees. 

Our turnover rate has increased from 

16.0% in 2019 to 24.4% in 2020, while 

the hire rate has decreased from 21.5% 

in 2019 to 4.5% in 2020 (refer to Table 

13). Overall, this resulted in the Group 

having a smaller headcount in 2020, as 

compared to 2019. This was mainly due 

to the COVID-19 pandemic, as the 

shipyard 

was 

forced 

to 

cease 

operations for a period of time in 2020 

as a result of the circuit breaker 

measures imposed by the Singapore 

government in response to the COVID-

19 pandemic and the Group’s business 

activities have reduced after the circuit 

breaker measures ended on 1 June 

2020. 

Training 

We have not presented training for 

other employment categories as those 

are cyclical in nature and immaterial 

(15% of the Group’s workforce). 

Training provided to non-executives are 

only to all male non-executives due to 

the circumstances that all female non-

executives holds administrative office 

roles. 

Training hours per employee per year 

has decreased from 7 hours per 

employee in 2019 to 5 hours per 

employee in 2020. This was due to 

majority of the core training for the 

workers being completed in 2017 to 

2019 and these trained workers are still 

with 

the 

Group. 

The 

COVID-19 

pandemic has an impact to the reduced 

training hours in 2020 too. 

LABOUR POLICY AND 

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 

SINGAPORE AND OTHER 

COUNTRIES AND ITS RELEVANT 

LAWS AND REGULATIONS 

A clear understanding of the applicable 

labour laws and regulations, as well as 

the labour policy and relationship 

between Singapore and other countries 

are required given that our shipyard 

business relies largely on foreign 

workers (including skilled workers) 

from Thailand, Bangladesh, China, 

India, Malaysia and Myanmar to meet 

our staffing needs.  

Our labour supply and its associated 

costs are correlated to developments of 

labour policies of the abovementioned 

countries as well as the relationship 

between them and Singapore. In 

addition to the above, we are also 

subjected 

by 

local 

employment 

legislation, in terms of hiring quota, 

levies 

and 

security 

bonds. 

Any 

unfavourable changes to either of the 

above 

will 

definitely 

affect 

our 

operations.  

We stay constantly updated to the 

labour policies between Singapore and 

other countries, and to the local 

legislation (largely in particular to the 

Singapore Budget), so as to react and 

tweak, at the earliest possible, our 

employment practices accordingly to 

minimise 

and 

mitigate 

any 

unfavourable impact.

OUR ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY 

Management Approach 

The going-concern and profitability of 

the Company are important for the 

Stakeholders. 

Financially 

sound 

strategy and operational method for 

the present and the future determine 

the profitability and sustainability of 

the 

Group. 

The 

accurate 

and 

transparent presentation of financial 

information in the financial statements 

will provide transparency of the 

performance and position of the Group 

for Stakeholders. 

We regularly review our operation and 

strategy 

risks 

affecting 

the 

sustainability of our businesses. The 

Group is on constant lookout for 

changes in 

business 

trends and 

opportunities to shift our business 

directions 

accordingly. 

This 

is 

accompanied by consultation with 

professionals, to ensure that the 

Group’s directions are on the right 

track. 

We also seriously consider and assess 

any weakness and lapse in controls 

made known during audits and strive 

to enhance the internal controls to 

ensure the effectiveness of our 

controls, as well as to ensure the true 

and 

fair 

view 

of 

the 

financial 

statements. 

PERFORMANCE IN 2020 

Economic value generated by the 

Group was reported at S$20.6 million in 

FY2020, decreased from S$28.9 million 

in FY2019. Total expenditure incurred 

by the Group, excluding Employee 

Wages and Benefits was S$13.6 million 

in FY2020, decreased from S$14.6 

million in FY2019. Group net profit was 

S$0.3 million in FY2020, as compared to 

S$3.8 million in FY2019.  

The decrease of Group net profit was 

mainly due to decrease in the Group’s 

revenue and the Group having to 

continue to incur basic salary costs for 

its foreign workers despite the closure 

of the Group’s key customer’s shipyard, 

which resulted in a temporary halt of 

the Group’s operations at the shipyard 

from April 2020 to June 2020. In 

FY2019, there were collection and 

recognition of revenue of S$7.8 million 

derived from final settlement of 

variation orders, while the associated 

cost had been recognised in previous 

financial years in line with accounting 

standards. This had led to a higher gross 

profit and gross profit margin being

employers 

during 

the 

COVID-19 

outbreak in FY2020. 

The Group paid tax of approximately 

S$125,000 in FY2020. Taxes paid are net 

of any tax rebates granted by the 

government, where applicable. 

Staff Costs 

In FY2020, staff costs amounted to 

S$9.5 million for 421 employees, which 

decreased from S$10.2 million for 490 

employees in FY2019, in the form of 

salary, wages, pension scheme based 

on respective jurisdictions (mainly 

Singapore’s Central Provident Fund 

(“CPF”)), foreign workers’ levy, skill 

development fund and other staff 

benefits (including, but not limited to, 

welfare given to staff and bonuses).  

Singapore’s CPF contributions were 

made in accordance to prevailing 

Central Provident Fund Act. The total 

pension paid, which was included in the 

total staff costs, was S$451,000 in 

FY2020, decreased from S$467,000 in 

FY2019. 

A detailed account of the full financial 

performance and position of the Group 

can be found in the Annual Report 

2020. 

Economic Value Delivered to the 

Society 

In FY2020, the Group generated S$20.6 

million of economic value for our 

Stakeholders, which was distributed to 

them through our business operations. 

The Group has generated employment 

opportunities, business opportunities 

to our suppliers, and tax revenues for 

the governments.  

The Group has generated negative 

S$0.1 economic value in FY2020, mainly 

due 

to 

subsidy 

received 

from 

government to support as a result of 

the COVID-19 pandemic, was greater 

than income tax paid for the year. 

Reportable Fines and Sanctions 

There is no reportable significant fine 

paid to and sanction (including non-

monetary form) imposed by laws and 

regulations in country where our 

operations 

exist,

TRUE AND FAIR VIEW OF THE 

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Financial information presented in the 

Annual 

Report is a medium of 

communication to the Stakeholders in 

informing how the Group is performing. 

We understand the importance of our 

Stakeholders 

and 

management 

in 

making informed decisions based on 

the Annual Report that presents a true 

and fair view of the Group’s financial 

performance and position.  

We ensure that the information 

contained in our Annual Reports are 

both 

adequate 

and 

free 

from 

misstatement (which can arise from an 

error, or from a fraudulent activity that 

remains undiscovered). Efforts made to 

ensure the true and fair view of the 

financial statements include: 

 Implementation of procedures; 

 Sending the finance team for 

training and updates; 

 Implementation of whistle-blowing 

procedures; and

 Introduction 

of 

contractual 

provisions to allow the Company to 

reclaim 

incentive 

components 

linked to the performance of the 

Company.

Implementation of procedures 

The 

Group 

has 

implemented 

procedures manual to govern the 

Group on how operational procedures 

should be carried out, and how 

employees should behave and perform 

in the interest of the Group. 

Training and Updates 

We periodically send our finance team 

for training and updates on the relevant 

reporting standards, such as those 

required by the Financial Reporting 

Standards of Singapore, the Code, SGX 

Catalist Rules, and so on. This is to 

ensure that the Annual Report is 


ES GROUP (HOLDINGS) LIMITED 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020 

OUR ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY 

25

prepared in accordance to the required 

standards and rules so as to give a true 

and fair view of the financial position 

and performance of the Group. The 

above function is undertaken by the 

Committee (refer to the section “Our 

Commitment 

to 

Sustainable 

Operation” of this report for the 

detailed 

responsibility 

of 

the 

Committee) to oversee compliance 

matters of the Annual Report. 

Whistle-blowing 

Whistle-blowing procedures have been 

implemented to ensure that everyone 

within the Group acts legally and in the 

interest of the Stakeholders. All this 

information is reported as required 

under the Code and can be found in the 

Annual Report 2020 page 37. Whistle-

blowing policy and whistle-blowing 

reports received (if any), will be 

assessed by the Audit and Risk 

Committee from time to time. Please 

refer 

to 

the 

section 

on 

“Our 

Commitment 

to 

a 

Sustainable 

Operation” in this report for further 

details.

Incentive-linked remuneration 

The remuneration of the Executive 

Directors’ and the key Management is 

linked to the performance of the 

Company (please refer to the Annual 

Report 2020 page 29). With effect from 

2018, the Company has adopted 

contractual provisions to safeguard 

against 

material 

misstatement 

of 

financial statements to deter and 

recover from the unlikely event of 

deliberate 

manipulation 

of 

the 

performance of the Company. Such 

contractual 

provisions 

allow 

the 

Company 

to 

reclaim 

incentive 

components of the remuneration from 

the Executive Directors’ and the key 

Management 

in 

the 

exceptional 

circumstances of misstatement of 

financial results or misconduct resulting 

in financial loss to the Company. 

PROJECT AND QUALITY 

MANAGEMENT 

New building and repair segment 

It is known that ineffective, poor 

planning and slow execution of a 

project plan can result in costly 

avoidable losses (such as wastages, 

disputable damages, overrun in project 

costs, liquidated damage claims and 

terminations from customers). At such, 

we have invested heavily on effective 

project management system to ensure 

effective and safe project execution 

with high quality deliverables.  

We have testified the above with the 

attainment of ISO, OHSAS and BizSafe 

Star certifications since 2009, which is a 

testament 

to 

our 

effective 

implementation of the processes across 

the Group. The certifications require us 

to be audited on an annual basis, which 

ensure 

that 

the 

above 

mention 

processes stay effective on a continuing 

basis. 

Shipping segment 

Similarly, we have high confidence on 

the operational processes in the ship 

chartering 

and 

marine 

supplies 

divisions to deliver high quality and 

timely charter services as well as 

efficient and timely supply of marine 

consumables and spare parts.  

The ship chartering division constantly 

monitors the performances and co-

ordination between the relevant agents 

and brokers to ensure that the vessels 

are competently crewed and well 

maintained at all times so as to ensure 

high 

utilisation 

with 

repeated 

customers at profitable rates, as well as 

avoid any downtime arising from poor 

co-ordination and planning which will 

result in demurrages and loss of charter 

opportunities. 

In the context of marine supplies, the 

division will ensure that the supply 

chain is properly managed, by fulfilling 

pre-requisites that may be imposed by 

suppliers so as to receive the supplies in 

good time shortly before fulfilling the 

promised 

delivery 

date 

to 

the 

customers. This mitigate risk arising 

from poor coordination with vendors, 

ship owners and ship managers that will 

result in poor customers’ satisfaction 

and loss of business opportunities. 

DIVERSIFICATION OF TRADES 

The Group understands the importance 

of diversification as the marine and 

offshore oil and gas industries are 

cyclical in nature. Any downturn in 

global or trade specific economic 

conditions such as the financial crisis in 

2008 and 2009, as well as the downturn 

in marine and offshore oil and gas 

industries due to the drastic fall in oil 

prices since 2015, will adversely affect 

us. There is no assurance that future 

economic downturns will not occur and 

hence steps to diversify are constantly 

being evaluated and implemented.  

Furthermore, diversification creates 

synergy, and allows sharing of technical 

resources, reduction of operational 

costs, higher market penetration and 

expansion of customer and supplier 

base.  

Besides expanding to undertake EPC, 

we are also constantly looking into 

possibilities 

of 

acquisition 

or 

establishment 

of 

complementary 

businesses or joint ventures with 

sustainable parties as and when 

opportunities arise. 

In 2012, we launched our first bareboat 

charter vessel after assessing the 

performance of this segment and noted 

its potential. In 2016, we officially 

placed more resources to further 

develop the shipping segment, with the 

acquisition of an additional vessel and 

started spot chartering services in 

December 2016. In mid-2017, we 

started the marine supplies division.  

In 2020, we completed the acquisition 

of ProXess Engineering Pte Ltd, which is 

a part of the Group’s effort to diversify 

into components sales, supplying valve, 

actuator 

and 

related 

solutions. 

Nonetheless, our focus of expanding 

the shipping segment continued from 

2018, where revenue from the shipping 

segment stood at 30.64% (FY2019: 

22.8%, FY2018: 23.7%) of the Group’s 

revenue in FY2020. The Group has also 

completed the acquisition of another 

vessel, ES Jewel, in 2021. With the 

diversification 

into 

the 

shipping 

segment, 

the 

Group’s 

revenue 

contribution concentration on new 

building and repair of offshore and 

marine structures and vessels has 

reduced.

MITIGATION OF IMPACT FROM 

CLIMATE CHANGE 

The burning of fossil fuels such as oil 

and gas is likely to change structurally in 

the coming years, with the Paris 

Climate Agreement first passed in 12 

December 2015 and with the COP24 in 

Katowice, Poland (also known as the 

24th Conference of the Parties to the 

United Nations Framework Convention 

on Climate Change (“UNFCCC”)). 

The conference continues to press 

nations to commit even tremendous 

global climate efforts to slow down 

global 

warming 

to 

under 

2°C, 

emphasising that current efforts are far 

from efficient in achieving the goal.  The 

conference also gave birth to a common 

climate rulebook, known as the Paris 

Agreement Rulebook (also common 

referred as the Katowice Rulebook) that 

aims to regulate on carbon emissions 

reduction and reporting7. 

Carbon 

emissions 

are 

directly 

correlated to the demand in the marine, 

offshore, oil and gas, where demand is 

likely to reduce over time with 

renewable energy sources sought for. 

This may drive oil prices downward 

which may affect us in the following 

manner: 

New building and repair segment 

Business activities in shipyards are 

expected to be impacted, and thus our 

core business will take a hit financially. 

As the market demand changes in the 

marine, offshore, oil and gas industries 

alongside with global trend, we will 

have to adapt and grow with the new 

changes. For instance, we have since 

2016 shifted our focus from the new 

building and conversion projects to the 

repair projects and components sales as 

we expected the demand for the new 

building and conversion to weaken over 

time. On the same note, we have also 

continued to focus on the expansion in 

our shipping segment this year. 

Shipping segment 

Our vessels are oil tank bunkers 

designed for the transportation of 

marine and gas oil for oil and gas 

companies. The impact of global 

warming will result in a change in 

market condition, either due to a 

change in the terrain throughout the 

region or the change in demand for 

chartering services.  

We have taken a prudent approach to 

determine the size of our fleet and the 

physical size of our vessels while we 

expand this segment. We constantly 

monitor 

market conditions within 

Southeast 

Asia, 

assess 

market 

competition before we decide on the 

viability of expanding our fleet size and 

vessel type to satisfy the current market 

condition. 

Please refer to section “Diversification 

of 

Trade” 

in 

this 

report 

for 

diversification efforts that further 

mitigate this risk.

 Continue to evaluate the impact at 

each point of supply chain in relation 

to sustainability and report on them. 

Management Approach 

The effectiveness of our sustainability 

efforts can only be optimised with the 

proper management of each major point 

of our supply chain, which ranges from 

the beginning of the supply chain (i.e. 

suppliers and subcontractors) to the final 

end user (charterers, contractors and 

end-user). Their sustainable efforts 

affect the performance of ours indirectly. 

The boundary of this topic can be wide, 

extending to a customer or supplier that 

we might not have direct contact, but 

may affect our sustainability efforts. We 

will however restrict our boundary to 

only active efforts that are applicable to 

our 

immediate 

suppliers, 

subcontractors, charterer, contractors, 

or end-user due to the practicality 

constraint. 

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT 

New building and repair segment 

In our core business, we primarily 

contract with and supply skilled labour 

and services to a shipyard (i.e. the 

contractor), 

acting 

as 

a 

resident 

subcontractor. 

The 

contractor 

is 

primarily 

responsible 

with 

the 

procurement of the required equipment 

and 

materials 

for 

the 

building, 

conversion and repairs work on the 

vessels. 

The 

contractor 

imposes 

regulations to regulate us, such as on 

areas of safety, material handling, and so 

on. 

We 

are 

responsible 

for 

the 

procurement 

of 

safety 

equipment, 

components and small equipment in the 

course of the supply of skilled labour and 

services. The completed job is first 

handed over to our contractor who will 

in turn handover the vessel once it is 

completed and ready for voyage. 

Shipping segment 

The shipping segment comprises of ship 

chartering, and the trading of marine 

supplies to vessels. The execution of a 

complete ship charter starts by charterer 

engaging us to transport liquid oil from a 

predetermined departure port to a 

Southeast 

Asia 

destination 

as 

determined by the charter agreement. 

We then engage port agents (both local 

and 

the 

Southeast 

Asia 

region), 

commercial managers, ship managers, 

and suppliers supplying marine gas oil 

and other marine supplies for the 

operation of our vessels.

As required by the Marine and Port 

Authority of Singapore (“MPA”) and in 

line 

with 

International 

Maritime 

Organisation 

(“IMO”), 

we 

will 

periodically conduct surveys on the 

vessels to ensure that it is optimal for 

voyages. 

We 

engage 

professional 

surveyors, equipment manufacturers, 

and subcontractors to survey, supply 

equipment, and service the vessels. 

In our marine supplies division, we 

engage suppliers and subcontractors for 

the bespoke fabrication of vessel’s 

components as well as the trading of 

consumables and other liquid goods on 

board vessels that are required by the 

customer. Goods, components and 

services are acquired from suppliers, and 

the requested goods are subsequently 

delivered to the customers. 

Management 

We have finalised our first Supplier Code 

of Conduct and circulated it to all our 

suppliers on 21 November 2019. This 

Supplier Code of Conduct is expected to 

be 

abided 

by 

all 

suppliers 

and 

subcontractors 

to 

ensure 

the 

sustainability of their operations in all 

areas of economic, environment, social 

and governance, which comprises of 

topic on business conduct, labour 

practices, 

health 

and 

safety, 

and 

environmental management. We believe 

that this will positively value-add to our 

sustainability effort throughout our 

supply chain and even benefit our 

suppliers themselves. 

New suppliers are assessed for any bad 

reputation and records, together with 

any presence of applicable certifications 

and licenses. These are credentials 

towards 

key 

sustainability 

factors 

relevant to us. Continuing assessments, 

such as mandated reporting, inspection 

visits or enquiry of information, shall be 

made accordingly to ensure acceptable 

standards of safety and health, quality, 

and environment are maintained. We 

will make the necessary changes upon 

observation of unsatisfactory standard. 

As for customers, we aim to ensure that 

the provision of the sales or services are 

not directly associated to matters on 

breach 

of 

safety, 

financial 

and 

environmental misconducts, or any 

other unethical practices. 

For those parties who are other than our 

immediate suppliers, subcontractors, 

charterer, contractors, or end-user, we 

will make effort to disassociate in the 

event that it is made known to us 

through credible sources (such as 

professional consultants, public news, 

and etc.) that there is breach of safety, 

financial and environmental recognised 

standards, or any other unethical 

practices. 

The Group is committed to make 

continuous efforts to work closely with 

parties in our supply chain to ensure best 

practices and alignment of policies. We 

are committed to cooperate with all 

parties for effective and safe operation. 

Commitment 

We 

practice 

fair 

competition 

in 

compliance of applicable competition 

laws and regulations in our businesses. In 

2020, there are no legal actions taken 

against the Group for anti-competitive 

behaviour, anti-trust, and monopoly 

practices.

OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE 

28



OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE

Management approach 

Environmental effort is an increasing hot 

topic around the world, and Singapore 

has committed on environmental effort 

with the signing of Paris Agreement on 

22 

April 

2016 

followed 

by 

the 

ratification on 21 September 2016. On 

31 March 2020, Singapore submitted its 

enhanced 

Nationally 

Determined 

Contribution (NDC) and Long-Term Low-

Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) 

documents 

to 

United 

Nations 

Framework Convention on Climate 

Change (UNFCC), to update Singapore’s 

climate pledge submitted earlier under 

the Paris Agreement. The Group is 

committed to participate in the effort of 

being “green” to be aligned with the 

nation and global effort.  

The inaugural Sustainability Report 

published in November 2018 for the 

reporting year of 2017 has initiated our 

attention to environmental issues in 

relation to our sustainability. We had 

then identified the existing efforts we 

have made as well as the relating 

Sustainability Factors that we can work 

on 

as 

part 

of 

our 

effort 

and 

commitment. We have implemented 

controls since 2018 to record data on 

energy consumption and the associated 

emissions.  

The boundary of this topic is restricted 

to the operations in Singapore due to 

the insignificance of the overseas 

operations (as illustrated in “Our 

Sustainability Topics” in this report). We 

have extended the boundary to include 

energy consumption and emissions from 

vessels in this report. We have chosen  

not to extend our boundary to the 

consumption made indirectly in our core 

business’ contractor’s shipyard due to 

the limited access to and availability of 

that information. We will only be able to 

report the consumption directly from 

the service provider or supplier where 

consumption information is readily 

available. We apply the Precautionary 

Principle (as described in The Rio 

Declaration 

on 

Environment 

and 

Development (1992) Principle 15) via 

the 

applicable 

legislation 

and 

regulations in our business to stay in 

compliance to the abovementioned 

legislation 

and 

regulations, 

where 

efforts are detailed below. 

ENERGY CONSUMPTION 

We 

started 

tracking 

our 

energy 

consumption data for the Group in 2018, 

but this was only for the direct 

consumption of energy purchased from 

service providers.  

In 2020, the Group consumed a total of 

15,897,329 kWh of energy in the form of 

low sulphur marine gas oil, electricity, 

gas and fuel purchased from suppliers / 

service 

providers, 

increased 

from 

14,223,277 kWh in 2019. Out of which 

49,851 kWh (2019: 43,699 kWh) related 

to energy used in dormitories and were 

subsequently reimbursed to the Group 

from workers staying in the dormitory. 

100% of the energy consumed is non-

renewable. 

EMISSIONS

The Group reported a total emission9 of 

4,432 metric tonnes (“MT”) of carbon  

dioxide (“CO2”) in 2020, increased by 

791 MT from 2019. After deducting 

emission related to the consumption 

subsequently reimbursed to the Group 

from workers staying in the dormitory of 

21 MT (2019: 18 MT), of which all are 

Scope 2 Emissions, the Group would 

have reported a net emission of 4,412 

MT in 2020 (2019: 3,624 MT). Total 

emission figure comprises of Scope 1 

Emissions10 of 4,308 MT and Scope 2 

Emissions11 of 125 MT. The composition 

of emissions only includes CO2. For 

2020, we have included the emissions 

from our vessels, but the analysis is still 

confined within Singapore’s operations. 

Scope 1 Emissions comprises direct 

emissions of fossil fuel consumed 

directly by the Group’s vessels and 

vehicles. Scope 2 Emissions comprises 

electricity and gas consumed by the 

Group. The resources reported here is 

the same as those reported in Energy 

Consumption Sustainability Factor.

Footnotes 

8.

Petrol, diesel and low sulphur marine gas oil energy are converted to kWh from litre consumed using a conversion factor of 

approximately 10.55, 9.32 and 10.64 respectively. Conversion factors are obtained from U.S. Energy Information Administration 

(“EIA”). 

9.

Emissions data are computed using the calculators from Greenhouse Gas Protocol website. We have applied financial control 

approach, as defined in GHG Protocol “A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard”. 

10. Scope 1 Emissions refers to direct GHG emissions occur from sources that are owned or controlled by the Group, expressed in CO2

equivalent in MT, as defined in GHG Protocol “A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard”. Figures excludes emissions from 

combustion of biomass, which the Group does not have. 

11. Scope 2 Emissions refers to GHG from the generation of purchased electricity consumed by the Group as defined in GHG Protocol “A 

Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard”.

OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE

WATER COMSUMPTION 

The Group reported a total water 

consumption of 31,798 cubic metres 

(“m3”) in 2020, as compared to 

16,658m3 in 2019. The significant 

increase was due to water consumption 

being overcharged in year 2018. The 

Group subsequently receive a refund 

for the overpayment, in August 2019. 

The water consumed is 100% from 

municipal water supplies. 

EFFLUENTS AND WASTE 

New building and repair segment 

The core business involves heavy usage 

of materials. However, as a resident 

subcontractor based in our contractor’s 

shipyard, we are bounded by the 

regulations imposed by the shipyard on 

how materials are used and disposed. 

The onus is on us to abide to the 

regulations set out by the contractor. 

All materials for the purpose of new 

building and repair works, are issued by 

the 

shipyard. 

Excess 

materials 

unutilised are returned to the shipyard 

for reuse. Any minor remnants of 

material are disposed in locations 

designated by the shipyard, and 

subsequently 

collected 

by 

waste 

collector. This ensure that wastage 

contributed 

by 

our 

workers 

are 

minimised and properly handled.

On the part of the Group’s effort, we 

educate 

our 

employees 

on 

the 

importance of efficient usage to reduce 

material 

wastage. 

Trainings 

are 

provided to improve the skillset of the 

workers, which will also translate to 

lesser wastage arising from inefficient 

use 

of 

materials. 

The 

materials 

purchased directly by us are safety 

equipment and small materials and 

they are disposed according to the 

shipyard regulation. 

Shipping segment 

Our vessels are registered under MPA’s 

Ship Registry of Ships (“SRS”), and the 

pre-requisites relating to the vessels are 

fulfilled 

through 

the 

classification 

awarded by Bureau Veritas and Nippon 

Kaiji 

Kyokai, 

which 

covers 

the 

compliance to various key convention 

and regulations set by the IMO and the 

International 

Labour 

Organization 

(“ILO”). Included in the classification is 

the various certifications covering key 

environmental conventions as seen in 

Table 21. 

The certifications are credentials of 

efforts taken to ensure that the 

structure, equipment systems, fittings 

and material used for the vessels fully 

comply with the requirements to 

prevent environmental pollution, be it 

through 

improper, 

unintentional, 

and/or accidental discharge of oil, spill 

of oil, disposal of garbage waste, and 

discharge 

of 

ozone 

depleting 

substances.  

OUR EFFORTS  

We continue to commit in reducing the 

use of carbon-emitting transportation 

to transport our workers. We are still 

using dormitory that houses workers 

within 

walkable 

distance 

to 

the 

shipyard. Out of the total workforce of 

421, 179 and 33 workers are currently 

staying in the shipyard and near (i.e. 

walking 

distance) 

the 

shipyard 

respectively.  

To further reduce the indirect emission 

of GHG via the use of public transport, 

we have and are still providing each 

worker with a bicycle. This is in line with 

the nation’s effort of a “Car-lite” city. 

For other workers staying at our own 

dormitory which is located outside the  

shipyard, we transport them to the 

shipyard using commercial buses and 

we ensure that the buses are fully 

occupied to maximise efficiency of each 

bus-trip.  

Our Group has also switched from using 

heavy marine fuel oil to low sulphur fuel 

oil since November 2019 for our vessel, 

ES Aspire. This is in compliance with 

IMO 2020, and is also part of our 

Group’s effort to move towards a lower 

emission future. 

OTHER COMPLIANCE MATTERS 

The Group has no operations that are 

on or near any habitat that are 

protected or have high biodiversity 

value as identified by international 

bodies such as the International Union 

for Conservation of Nature (“IUCN”). 

As of the reporting date of the Annual 

Report 2020, the Group has not been 

penalised for any non-compliance of 

environmental laws and regulations 

imposed by Singapore and will continue 

to work with the relevant authorities to 

stay updated so as to continue to 

comply with the laws and regulations.
