Message  

from Chairman

Dear Stakeholders,

The past financial year – FY2021 – was an unprecedented 

year for King Wan Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries 

(“King Wan” or the “Group”), and  businesses worldwide. 

The disruptions and uncertainty that the global pandemic 

brought to all aspects of our business cannot be 

overstated, contributing to rising costs of materials and 

labour, and project suspensions and delays.

As the world scrambled to tackle the challenges the 

COVID-19 pandemic brought and live with the new 

normal, dealing with the pandemic and the deep 

uncertainty ahead has reinforced the importance of 

corporations being resilient, adaptable, and sustainable.

In this 4th Sustainability Report of King Wan, we have 

set aside a section to highlight our COVID-19 response 

- the ways we have worked to prioritise the safety of 

our employees and workers, adapting to the new ways 

of working, and seizing opportunities that the pandemic 

brought.

King Wan recognises the importance of sustainability 

and actively embraces sustainability practices in the 

Group’s strategic formulation process. It is our belief 

that by doing so, we can:

• 

achieve sustainable growth;

• 

care for our people; and

• 

protect our environment.

The challenges faced in the past year has strengthened 

our commitment to sustainability, and we will continue 

to work towards integrating sustainability practices 

throughout the organisation to create long-term value 

for all our stakeholders, and do our part in building a 

safe, sustainable and resilient corporation.

King Wan Corporation Limited


King Wan’s 

COVID-19 Response

As part of our business continuity plan, we assembled 

a management-led Task Force with key employee 

representatives in February 2020. Standard operating 

procedures were drawn up in response to COVID-19 

scenarios and disseminated. We had regular employee 

communications and broadcast advisories to keep them 

updated on the latest developments and our work 

arrangements.

The safety and well-being of our stakeholders was 

paramount, and we took all necessary precautionary 

measures in accordance with the guidelines from the 

Singapore government.

Employee Health, Safety and Well-Being

We distributed masks and hand sanitisers to our 

employees, strengthened sanitation measures in the 

office, and increased disinfection frequencies of high 

touch points in the office. 

Frontline employees were provided with masks and 

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and training on 

their use. 

We provided temporary accommodations for employees 

who chose to relocate to continue working in Singapore 

when Malaysia initiated the Movement Control Order 

in March 2020, as well as facilitated our employees in 

telecommuting and provided IT support arrangements 

for remote working.

Employees 

were 

also 

engaged 

with 

regular 

teleconferences and broadcasts to provide a summary 

of resources available, such as where to seek healthcare 

hotlines and safe management measures.

Migrant worker community

We also especially reached out to ensure the well-

being and safety of the section of our community that 

was thrust into the spotlight during the pandemic – our 

migrant worker community.

We supported them with provision of daily necessities 

and food, paying special attention for muslim migrant 

workers when they fast during the Ramadan period.

We also provided for their Wi-Fi and mobile data needs, 

and avenues to connect to our team of employee 

volunteers in ensuring their health mental disposition.

A team of employees also stepped up to volunteer in 

cleaning and disinfecting the worker’s dormitory on our 

premises.

Here were some of the other ways we supported our 

employees and community during the pandemic:

• 

Provision of hand sanitisers at several points in the 

office, warehouse and worker’s dormitory;

• 

Deferment of all non-essential events;

• 

Implementation of stringent measures on safe 

distancing in the office, warehouse and worker’s 

dormitory;

• 

Delivery of food to employees who have no local 

dependents during the lockdowns;

• 

Escalated upskilling through online learning on 

relevant topics for employees ; and

• 

Expanded 

usage 

of 

cloud-based 

resources 

to 

synchronise and collaborate work among employees.

Supporting Customers

Our engineering and technical teams worked 24/7 to 

ensure minimal disruption of our essential services 

during the Circuit Breaker period.

Our team also participated in the quick conversion 

of existing multi-storey carparks to temporary living 

quarters for the migrant workers.

Additional resources were deployed at key premises such 

as hospitals, polyclinics, Government Community Care 

Facilities, Community Isolation Facilities and dormitories 

to meet enhanced sanitation needs. 

Our engineering team also innovated and provided 

modified portable lavatories to meet customer needs and 

adhere to space constraints at some of these facilities.

Corporate Social 

Responsibility Initiative 

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 

Corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) has evolved over 

the years to become an integral part of the organisation. 

It has expanded to more dimensions such as corporate 

responsibility to our stakeholders – our shareholders, 

employees, customers, suppliers, sub-contractors and 

the wider community. We actively seek to play a part 

to improve the environment and contribute to the 

well-being of the communities in which we live and do 

business.

We encourage our employees to volunteer at the 

individual and corporate level. Some of our initiatives 

this year include:

Care to Clean and Disinfect 

During the pandemic lockdown, a group of our 

employees, geared in masks, face shields and 

personal protective equipment, stepped forward and 

initiated to serve our migrant workers by cleaning and 

disinfecting their dormitory. It was hot, strenuous 

and draining work, but it was a humbling experience 

which reminded us of what our migrant workers 

experience daily over the past years, as they built our 

houses and roads, and provided services to us.

Care to Trim

On 19 July 2020, a group of our migrant workers 

residing at the former Ngee Ann Polytechnic spent 

their Sunday morning helping to trim 1.5 hectares of 

overgrown grass around HDB blocks in Toh Yi. It was 

hard to maintain the estate’s landscaping during that 

period as workers in many horticultural firms had not 

been cleared by the authorities to resume work. Our 

workers were happy to have a chance to contribute 

and give back.

Care to Pack and Deliver

During Ramadan this year, Muslim migrant workers 

had to fast under Circuit Breaker conditions, while 

being quarantined. Our team prepared dates (kurma) 

and packed them in smaller packets for individual 

distribution. Dates are a staple for Muslims to break 

their fast as it helps to boost their energy and is 

also a good supplement for nutrition. Our Muslim 

employees took time to go from room to room in 

the dormitory to explain and remind our migrant 

workers to practice safe distancing when performing 

their prayers. There were others who delivered food 

during the early hours of the morning island-wide to 

migrant workers staying at other locales. 

Care to Gift and Engage

Since 2014, we have been working with the Muscular 

Dystrophy Association (Singapore) (“MDAS”) in 

support of their mission to maximise the quality of 

life of people with Muscular Dystrophy and their 

families, to integrate into society and support 

research towards a cure. All corporate funds raised 

are channelled into supporting MDAS’ essential 

programmes and services for beneficiaries such 

as therapy sessions to help slow down muscle 

deterioration and transport subsidies for fetching 

beneficiaries between home and school in specialised 

vehicles. We also continue to promote opportunities 

for young adults with severe muscular dystrophy 

to be meaningfully employed by engaging them for 

print or web-based collaterals, through BizPower – a 

centre-based employment programme run by MDAS.

Legal Compliance and 

Corporate Governance

compliance. It is of paramount importance that the 

Group abides by legal and regulatory requirements 

and is in compliance with, including but not limited to, 

the Code of corporate Governance issued by Monetary 

Authority of Singapore and guidelines provided by BCA, 

Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”), Singapore Civil Defence 

Force (”SCDF”), National Environmental Agency (”NEA”) 

and other relevant regulators.

For further details on Corporate Governance, please 

refer to pages 17 to 40 of the Annual Report.

Conflict of Interest Policy

The Company has set out procedures governing all 

interested persons transactions to ensure that they 

are carried out at arm’s length, on normal commercial 

terms and not be detrimental to the interests of the 

Group and our shareholders.

In FY2021, there were no identified conflicts of 

interest between the Group and any interested party.

Customer Privacy Policy

King Wan protects the privacy and confidentiality of 

our customers’ information. We do not divulge or sell 

personal information to third parties for marketing 

or promotional purposes. All employees are guided 

by King Wan’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. 

In FY2021, there were no identified cases regarding 

breach of customer privacy or loss of customer data.

Anti-Corruption Policy

King Wan takes a strong stand against corruption 

and bribery in the Group. We provide an accessible 

platform for employees and third parties to raise 

concerns about any wrongdoing and improper 

conduct within the Group.

New employees are trained on the Code of Business 

Conduct and Ethics and briefed on the whistle-

blowing policy.

In order to facilitate the reporting of suspected cases 

of fraud, corruption, workplace harassment or other 

improper activities, independent investigations are 

carried out in a timely manner. Appropriate action 

will be taken to correct any weaknesses in internal 

controls and policies to prevent a recurrence.

In FY2021, there were no incidents of corruption and 

no public legal cases brought against the Group or its 

employees.

Compliance with Laws and Regulations 

The Group has put in place policies and procedures 

to ensure compliance with relevant laws and 

regulations, particularly those relating to BCA, MOM, 

SCDF and NEA. At the corporate level, we also ensure 

that we are in compliance with the  SGX-ST Listing 

Rules, Securities and Futures Act and the Singapore 

Companies Act. 

Through 

constant 

monitoring, 

evaluation, 

and auditing of our ISO 45001:2018 certified 

Occupational 

Health 

and 

Safety 

(”OH&amp;S”) 

management system, King Wan actively ensures 

that all our activities and operations comply with 

existing regulatory requirements. Any changes and 

non-compliance with the relevant laws are made 

known to the management, and actions are taken to 

ensure compliance.

Towards ensuring continued improvement, we have 

reviewed and streamlined our processes to improve 

and tighten the procedures at construction sites.  In 

addition, we have implemented an ISO 14001:2015 

certified Environmental, Health and Safety standard 

(“EHS”) management system. 



11

Sustainability Report 2021


Environmental 

Initiative

At King Wan, we strive to carry out our business 

operations in a socially responsible manner and are 

committed to protecting the environment. We believe 

that the efficient use of natural resources such as energy 

and water will contribute positively to the Group’s 

sustainable growth in the long term.

We continue to use more energy-efficient lightings and 

lift in our office building, thereby reducing electricity 

consumption. Additionally, we use water-efficient 

fittings and fixtures in our corporate office to reduce 

water consumption, as well as adopt environmentally 

friendly methods of waste disposal in our desilting 

business. 

The 

management 

also 

strongly 

encourages 

and 

reinforces the importance of practising the 3Rs (i.e. 

reduce, reuse and recycle) in our daily operations – the 

responsible usage of electricity, water and paper by 

every employee. King Wan believes that every small 

effort counts and goes a long way in contributing to 

the conservation and protection of the earth’s natural 

resources.

Energy Efficiency 

As a result of our continuous efforts to reduce energy and water consumption, as well as reduced usage during the 

pandemic due to capacity changes, we recorded a 13.8% reduction in electricity consumption and a 46.9% reduction 

in water consumption This improvement allowed us to reduce our carbon footprint and enjoy 15.9% cost savings on 

our electricity bills, and 46.9% savings on our water bills.

Workplace  

Safety &amp; Health

At King Wan, we are guided by our philosophy “Lead the 

Way – Safety First” in our care for our employees and 

communities. Workplace safety and health (“WSH”) is of 

paramount importance to us. We firmly believe that work 

progress cannot be achieved at the expense of safety. 

Management sets the tone by defining and enforcing 

clear WSH management guidelines, fostering a safe and 

conducive working environment. 

We place great emphasis on proper installation 

methods, fire and emergency safety compliance, 

maintenance of equipment and materials integrity. 

Qualified professionals such as engineers and technical 

supervisory staff are engaged to monitor construction 

progress and ensure that developments are built in 

accordance with building regulations and codes. All 

our employees and subcontractors are expected to 

meet King Wan’s high standards of quality, safety and 

sustainability for projects.

COVID-related measures 

As covered in the section “King Wan Group’s COVID-19 

Response”.

Health and Safety Policies

Our commitment to WSH is based on the belief 

that a good working environment not only makes 

our employees safer, but also enables them to focus 

better, enjoy high work morale, and increase their work 

productivity and efficiency. 

Safety Courses and Training Hours

We ensure that our employees are adequately 

orientated on site safety measures and regulations, 

in addition to being well-trained in WSH standards and 

regulations through WSH courses. Employees with 

designated job scope are also further assessed based 

on specialised requirements and sent for training in 

relevant courses. 

Our endeavour in achieving and maintaining high 

WSH standards sees King Wan putting in place a 

comprehensive Safety and Health management system, 

which has been certified in ISO 45001, ISO 9001:2015 and 

awarded with the bizSAFE Star accreditation.  

Regular Health and Safety Meetings 

During our regular project meetings, latest health 

and safety matters and reports on any related issue 

or incident are prioritised and promptly highlighted. 

Attendees are also constantly reminded to follow 

recommended 

safety 

measures 

and 

regulations. 

Relevant findings and new policies are communicated in 

a timely manner to the rest of the project team.

Our respective Project-in-charge will also carry out 

regular site safety inspections to ensure that WSH 

standards and measures are fully observed at all times.

In FY2021, we have achieved zero fatalities both at the 

corporate office and project sites.

The quality of our project determines how well 

we add value to our customers. It is our priority to 

deliver innovative green designs, high standards of 

workmanship without compromising on functionality 

or price. Established in 1989, CONQUAS is the industry 

benchmark for quality and workmanship standards of 

construction projects in Singapore. With an average 

CONQUAS score of 97.03, King Wan’s score is significantly 

above the latest industry’s average of 90.1 obtained 

from BCA’s website.

King Wan believes that for the Group to grow and stay 

relevant in this competitive business landscape, it is 

critical that we invest in our employees’ learning and 

development and equip them with knowledge and 

relevant skills to perform well in their jobs. The Group 

strives to develop our employees through training, job 

rotation and internal promotion opportunities. Training 

needs are identified and implemented at the start of 

each year. We encourage employees to take up relevant 

job-related skill courses.

The number of total training hours clocked in FY2021 

was 5,143 hours, lower than the 5,907 hours recorded 

in FY2020, largely due to the increased difficulties 

of attending hands-on, in-person courses during the 

pandemic.

However, even during the circuit-breaker, our staff 

also attended more than 1,100 hours of digital training 

courses, taking full advantage of downtime to upgrade 

and develop key skills.

King Wan’s compensation packages are aligned with 

internal parity and market benchmarks. King Wan 

offers fair and competitive remuneration packages 

based on employees’ performance, and expected roles 

and responsibilities. This is to ensure that we remain 

competitive in attracting talent, which is key to our 

sustained growth. King Wan also has a well-structured 

and open annual performance appraisal system which 

is reviewed periodically and enhanced to ensure open 

communication between employees and their reporting 

officers.

Competitive Remuneration

Remuneration is recommended by the HR Department 

and the respective HODs, and approved by the 

Remuneration Committee which consists of members 

from King Wan’s Board of Directors. Compensation 

packages are benchmarked against market surveys to 

ensure relevancy of King Wan’s salaries to the industry 

and overall market. 

Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) Scheme and Contributions

The CPF is a comprehensive social security savings 

plan which aims to provide working Singaporeans 

and Permanent Residents with a measure of financial 

security and confidence in their old age. CPF contribution 

is computed based on a percentage of the employee’s 

monthly salary and varies with the employee’s age.
