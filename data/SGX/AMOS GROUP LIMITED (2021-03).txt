We are pleased to issue the third Sustainability Report 

(“Report”) for AMOS Group Limited (“AMOS”).  The Report 

reflects AMOS’ performance as well as our strategy and vision 

towards a sustainable future.

We believe sustainable business practices are intrinsic to 

our organisational vision and mission.  AMOS recognizes 

the importance of delivering value through responsible 

and positive contributions to both the environment and 

society.  As a result, we focus our sustainability strategy 

on the management of Economic, Environmental, Social 

and Governance (“EESG”) factors that are significant to our 

business.

FY2021 was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic 

and the resultant disruptions continue to remain challenging. 

Nonetheless, AMOS continues to work on reducing its 

environmental 

impact 

and 

pursue 

opportunities 

for 

improvement.  This year we are pleased to announce our solar 

partnership with Urban Renewables to produce clean sources 

of energy and reduce our carbon footprint.  We are furthering 

our efforts to improve the environment through our waste 

management initiatives, which will increase in the upcoming 

year as we commence reporting on packaging waste as part of 

Singapore’s Zero Waste Masterplan.

Over the past year, our Human Resources department 

organized CSR initiatives to positively contribute to the 

communities in which we operate.  Our employees participated 

in a blood donation drive and fundraising initiative, all of which 

reminds us of the importance of charitable contributions and 

employee engagement.  AMOS also helped its employees 

during these turbulent times brought by the pandemic 

through the distribution of festive treats and personal 

protective equipment.  As the pandemic continues to effect 

public health, AMOS is committed to ensuring the health, 

safety and wellbeing of its employees.

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of AMOS Group Limited 

is committed to sustainability and fully supports the adoption 

of the SGX sustainability reporting guidelines.  The Board 

oversees 

AMOS’ 

sustainability 

performance, 

practices 

and initiatives, and its compliance with SGX guidelines on 

sustainability reporting by reviewing progress throughout the 

year.  The Board was also involved in the determination of the 

material ESG factors for AMOS.

Through our sustainability journey, we encourage our 

stakeholders and business partners to join us in furthering 

the economic, environmental, and social well-being of the 

communities with which we interact and together contribute 

to a more sustainable society.

(a) 

Energy and Emissions

Why this is material

AMOS is a global provider of supplies, services, and solutions to major international shipping fleets and energy operators.  Our 

fulfilment centre in Singapore operates as our headquarters, warehousing, cold chain storage, and provisioning.

Across our operations, we utilize two main sources of energy consumption.  Our chartered vessels and fleet of vehicles run 

on diesel, whilst our office premises, warehouse, and fulfilment centre primarily use electricity.  At AMOS, we steer toward the 

reduction of our total energy consumption to mitigate our carbon footprint and negative impact on the environment.  We also 

acknowledge the importance of this reduction in driving cost savings and overall, improving our economic performance.

Management Approach

Adopting renewable energy alternatives: Solar Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Urban Renewables

In FY2021, AMOS signed a PPA with Urban Renewables, a sustainable energy solutions provider and developer, to install solar PVs 

on the rooftop of the Group’s headquarters.  We aim to fulfil our commitment towards a more sustainable business by using clean 

solar energy through the installation of the 300 kWp solar project.  The capacity of the installed panels will be 481,000 kWh and 

we will be employing the panels to drive our electricity consumption during the day.  We estimate to consume 437,766 kWh of 

energy from the solar panels, resulting in approximately $13,133 savings per year.  Urban Renewables will additionally install 2 EV 

charging stations at our headquarters and assist in further implementing energy efficiency improvements.

Through this alliance, we have developed a 36-month plan to further our key sustainability strategies including increasing 

our overall energy efficiency, growing the proportion of renewables in our energy supply, and purchasing more green power, 

ultimately aiming to negate our unavoidable carbon emissions.  Our plan has commenced with the installation of the solar panels 

upon the rooftops of the building and will proceed to focusing on energy efficient modifications across our headquarters.  The 

plan also entails the creation of a building management system to inculcate smart technology for increased energy efficiency 

over the upcoming years.

We also continue our dedication in lowering our energy use by increasing awareness amongst employees, implementing 

energy efficient technologies, and leveraging carbon offsets.  We have continued with the following practices to curb energy 

consumption.

E N V I R O N M E N T

Awareness among employees

&gt; Display energy saving posters and related labelling in prominent areas in the AMOS office, and warehouse to remind 

employees of energy conservation practices.

&gt; Improve AMOS employees’ awareness of energy savings in yearly briefings.

&gt; Encourage employees to reduce energy consumption in the office by maintaining an adequate air temperature in office.

Energy efficient technologies

&gt; Use of motion sensor lights at stairways and toilets.

&gt; Use of energy saving bulbs.

&gt; Efficient planning of route for our fleet.

&gt; Efficiency checks on chillers conducted during the year.

Carbon Neutral Program

At AMOS, we view reducing our carbon footprint as a journey, and to account for the emissions we are unable to currently reduce, 

we have continued our participation in the Carbon Neutral Program.  From our involvement, we purchase carbon offsets for our 

emissions and these offsets support renewable energy generation projects.  We have been awarded with the following carbon 

neutral certificates by Environmental Solutions (Asia) Pte Ltd (“ES Power”):

Targets

We continue to strive toward our overall goal of achieving a zero-carbon footprint.  As per our energy efficiency plan, we will be 

installing smart technology to ensure the efficient use of energy at our headquarters in Singapore.

Effluent and waste management

Why this is material

Our operations result in the creation of non-hazardous waste, primarily metal scrap, plastics, paper, and wood among others. 

At AMOS, we acknowledge the importance of proper waste disposal techniques to ensure that we do not cause environmental 

damage through land or air pollution.  We manage our waste through waste reduction initiatives as they are imperative in 

bettering the environment, reducing our operational costs, and fostering innovation in design.

Management Approach

We undertook the following waste reduction measures in FY2021:

&gt; We have continued our engagement with Tidy Waste Management, an external waste collector that ensures our recyclable 

waste is properly handled and disposed.  The collectors provide bins and place them across different sections of the 

warehouse, segregating the waste into paper and plastics.  The waste is collected daily and is ultimately compiled at the end 

of every month for its subsequent sale for recycling purposes.

1 

We have revised our FY2020 electricity data as it did not include the data from one of our entity in our report last year.

2 

This data was acquired from the diesel consumed by 4 of our vessels.

3 

This figure has been recalculated based on the revised electricity consumption figure. We used the emission factors 0.4188 kgCO2/kWh 

(2018), for calculation of CO2 [Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/cmsmedia/Publications_and_Statistics/Statistics/18RSU.pdf ]

4 

We used the emission factors 0.4085 kgCO2/kWh (2019), for calculation of CO2.

We use the emission factors 74,100 kg/TJ, for calculation of CO2.

&gt; Since its inauguration, AMOS’s Group Global Plastic Policy has remained in effect with a commitment to consume and manage 

fewer resources responsibly by adopting the ‘reduce, reuse, recycle’ principles across all our waste streams and procurement 

decisions.

&gt; Since FY2020, AMOS has continued tracking the amount of plastic used to wrap pallets, which are shrink wrapped to protect 

against adverse weather conditions.  We are pleased to report that in FY2021, we have reduced our plastic consumption for 

the wrapping of pallets from 700 grams per pallet to an average of 440 grams per pallet.

&gt; As of FY2021, we no longer store diesel or chemicals at our sites, and therefore do not have any hazardous waste to report as 

part of our scope.

&gt; AMOS has continued its position as a core member of the joint committee with DNVGL and Wilhelmsen Ship Management, 

to tackle issues of plastics in the marine industry.  Whilst we continue providing monthly reports to the committee about our 

plastic reduction, there were no round table discussions conducted in FY2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our People

At AMOS, we view our employees as our most vital asset as they are pertinent in ensuring the continuity and success of our 

business.  We embrace diversity and inclusion whilst focusing on fair and equitable employment practices throughout our 

recruitment process.  We aim to nurture a motivated workforce by attracting, developing, and retaining the best to work with us.

Our COVID-19 Response

Over the past year, the world was enveloped by an unforeseen circumstance, the COVID-19 pandemic.  Whilst this has resulted in 

numerous challenges and disruptions across our operations, AMOS’s focus remains on ensuring the wellbeing and safety of its 

employees through these difficult times.  We were quick to implement our ‘Safe Management Measures’ (SMM) plan to ensure 

employee safety, business continuity, and work-from-home arrangements, as per the government guidelines. The SMM explicates 

all the safe social practices and emergency preparedness responses mandated by staff with regard to COVID-19.

Employee welfare and talent retention

Why is it material

At AMOS, we believe that attracting and retaining the right talent ensures business growth, succession planning, and alleviates 

the overall morale of the organization.

Management Approach

In FY2021, we made our comprehensive employee handbook available to our staff, assisting in the global alignment of all our 

policies, including the unified code of conduct, whistleblowing policy, disciplinary actions, payroll, leave, and recruitment matters. 

The new employee handbook is also robust as it entails a portion that highlights policies specific to the different countries in which 

we have our operations.  Furthermore, we have refreshed our employee code of conduct, KPIs, and appraisal processes as per our 

target in FY2020.  The policies outlined in the employee handbook are conveyed to all our employees through communication 

sessions, which have received positive feedback.

AMOS is dedicated to continuously engaging its employees to comprehend any grievances they may share.  Over the year, we 

hosted a Townhall where employees were requested to attend at staggered hours.  This was to ensure a continued open dialogue 

with our staff whilst keeping them abreast with any emerging challenges.  Since the introduction of our new CEO in November 

2020, we aim to host a large-scale virtual townhall in FY2022.

As a part of our employee welfare and retention management process, we practice fair employment, provide employment 

benefits, reward their performance, and build a diverse culture.

Fair Employment

We continue to reward employees fairly based on their ability, performance, contribution, and experience.  All our employees 

are given employment contracts with clear terms and conditions, and equal employment opportunities that are clearly cited in 

the employee handbook.  We adhere to the labour laws in Singapore and adapt the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive 

Employment Practices (“TAFEP”).  Additionally, we ensure that our employees declare any conflicts of interest on an annual basis, 

and we subsequently address them.

6 

We do not have any part time employees. We also do not have any employees to whom collective bargaining agreements apply.

S O C I A L

Sustainability Report 2021 | AMOS Group Limited  |  13 


Employee Benefits

The welfare and medical benefits for our employees is a great priority.  We provide insurance for all our employees and facilitate 

annual health screening for our senior management and elderly employees.  In light of the pandemic, AMOS has dispersed hand 

sanitizers and masks to its employees to ensure they are well protected.

In FY2021, AMOS gifted each staff member a Christmas pudding for them to share with their family during the festive season.  As 

we were unable to celebrate Chinese New Year together, we hosted a fun lucky draw for our employees.  The winners were gifted 

a Chinese New Year themed hamper.  Additionally, during the mooncake festival, AMOS distributed mooncakes to all its staff in 

Singapore as means of upholding their morale and facilitating inclusion.

AMOS’s Human Resources (HR) Department organized a Blood Donation Drive for its employees to foster engagement and further 

our corporate social responsibility.  Ultimately, 39 of our employees partook in the donation drive.  Additionally, the AMOS’s HR 

established the “AMOS Community Welfare Fund” initiative, which aims to deliver food and gift hampers to needy groups across 

communities in Christmas of 2020.  Many of our employees donated to the cause and we collectively raised $6,130 for distribution 

across three charitable beneficiaries in Singapore:

➢ 

Care for the Elderly Foundation

➢ 

CARE SG (Children-at-Risk Empowerment)

➢ 

MINDS (Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore)

In FY2021, we established ‘Flexi Working Hours’, which entails a work arrangement for our staff to have the freedom to establish 

their location of work.  Our employees consolidate this work arrangement with their respective head of department and 

subsequently are able to work flexibly.

As AMOS’s industry is foreign labour intensive their welfare is pertinent to the success of our operations.  We continue to provide 

them with housing allowances with the purpose of enabling better flexibility in their choice of living.  We also provide transport 

to all our employees from the MRT station to the workplace to limit their public exposure, in light of COVID-19, and to assist those 

who are reliant on public transport as they do not possess their own vehicle.

For our Malaysian staff who were displaced as a result of Malaysia’s Movement Control Order, AMOS financially assisted in housing 

them in hotels in Singapore.  We continue to abide by all government regulations and ensure the to remain abreast with any 

updates to protect our employees.

Diversity and Equal Opportunities

AMOS is committed to fair, equitable, and quality employment practices in our recruitment process to attract, develop, and retain 

a talented, innovative, flexible, and motivated workforce in every country that we operate in.  All employment decisions will 

conform to the principle of equal opportunity by imposing only the valid requirements of the position on the candidate under 

consideration.  We encourage diversity of race, age, skills, experience and gender, assessing candidates and employees on merit 

alone.

Occupational Health and Safety

Why is it material

Our industry is prone to numerous health and safety risks, therefore requiring adherence to stringent safety policies in ensuring 

the wellbeing of our employees.  At AMOS, we do not compromise on the safety of our employees and workers.

Management Approach

Operational health and safety (“H&amp;S”) are managed holistically by all departments, where all departmental heads are responsible 

for the safety of the employees under their charge.  All our staff are empowered to halt any activity that threatens their safety.

At AMOS, we have an established Quality, Health, Security, Safety, Environment (“QHSSE”) department that is responsible for 

promoting, administering, and governing H&amp;S directives and performance throughout the organization.  The QHSSE Department 

along with HR also ensures that every new employee goes through an induction program where basic H&amp;S responsibilities for 

all employees are conveyed.  The AMOS QHSSE Department also continues to work with our HR to identify relevant courses to 

continue developing our employees’ competencies for operational safety supervision and management.  The QHSSE Department 

is also responsible for routinely engaging all departments to track, monitor, and improve their H&amp;S performance.

S O C I A L

16  |  AMOS Group Limited | Sustainability Report 2021


As a result of the pandemic, the QHSSE Department was unable to organize the bi-annual fire safety drills.  Instead, the department 

hosted two table talk discussions to facilitate a virtual simulation and update employees on fire safety guidelines.

In FY2021, we updated our Global Group Health Safety Security and Environment Policy Statement.  The QHSSE department is 

responsible for the communication of QHSSE updates across all entities to ensure best practices are shared and standard practices 

can be established across the organization.  The department also organizes a monthly committee meeting to discuss safety 

performance, incidents that have occurred, best practices, H&amp;S Campaigns planning, and to ensure that feedback from workers 

and other employees are addressed.

At AMOS, we have a Risk Management Organization Chart that assigns responsibility for conducting risk assessments and 

ensuring that all control measures are adequately addressed on the ground.  For every operational activity, a BizSafe Level 2 

trained personnel approved by the Risk Management Organization Chart Team Leader is given the responsibility to conduct risk 

assessment of that activity.  The outcome of the risk assessments is communicated to the ground workforce.  Generally, all risks 

are assessed by a 5x5 matrix and control measures are determined by the hierarchy of controls.

AMOS QHSSE Department also works very closely with the Procurement department to ensure compliance to the Inventory of 

Hazardous Materials regulations issued by IMO.  This regulation ensures that all specified potentially hazardous material supplied 

to the vessel are within the acceptable threshold limit.  AMOS has set up a process and system to govern the purchases of these 

products, which include:

➢ 

Establishing a controlled guideline for all suppliers supplying these materials;

➢ 

Declaration of suppliers’ commitment to comply with the guidelines;

➢ 

Suppliers’ processes and physical site audits by the QHSSE Department and;

➢ 

A site audit of the suppliers’ manufacturer for a specific product, by QHSSE Department.

(a) 

Responsible supply chain management

Why is it material

Our supply chain includes a several parties.  Our marine 

supplies range from technical supplies such as steel valves 

and personal protective equipment (“PPE”) to general supplies 

such as frozen food and water.  Our rigging, mooring, and 

lifting business segment procures rigging equipment, rigging 

systems along with consumables amongst other items.  A large 

number of our suppliers are based overseas.

We are cognizant that the suppliers we engage with have 

a significant impact on our sustainability performance. 

Additionally, ensuring that our suppliers provide high 

standards of product quality, health, and safety will directly 

improve what we offer to our customers.

Management Approach

AMOS has a close relationship with its strategic partners 

and suppliers who are committed to high quality and safety 

standards.  We engage with reputable manufacturers and 

strive for lean procurement to support fast turn-around and 

minimization of wastage.

We have a Procurement and Supplier Management Policy, 

which utilizes the Supplier Questionnaire Form to promote and 

maintain sustainable procurement activities and governance.  

Our Supplier Questionnaire Form is employed to evaluate 

our suppliers’ risk assessment on Quality, Health and Safety, 

Environmental and Social responsibility.  Any gaps identified 

for potential improvement is followed up with a Supplier 

Improvement Action Plan arranged by the QHSSE Department.

Prior to engaging with a new supplier, we perform a pre-

qualification assessment as part of our Know Your Supplier 

(“KYS”) policy.  This is through a checklist filled by the vendor 

applicants.  After assessment, selected vendors are included 

in the Approved Vendor List (“AVL”).  In addition to quality 

considerations, compliance with environmental regulations, 

and health and safety practices are key requirements.

For high risk suppliers, we also conduct periodic audits 

and checks, particularly as many of our customers demand 

supply chain visibility on the use of hazardous materials such 

as asbestos.  We have established the database where the 

relevant material certifications and test reports are readily 

available to customers to support the Inventory of Hazardous 

Material (IHM).

Performance

We screened 7 of our suppliers in FY2021 using environmental 

and social criteria.  In FY2021, we did not identify any high-risk 

suppliers.

As per our target for FY2021, we worked on our supplier code 

of conduct and introduced a mandatory requirement for all 

our suppliers to complete a conflict of interest form upon 

engagement.  We have also reviewed our supplier base and 

refined our supply chain to ensure that it is not impacted by 

the current pandemic.

Target

We aim to maintain stringent assessments and audits on 

our vendors.  We strive to achieve zero incidences of non-

compliance concerning environmental and social criteria in 

the upcoming year.

(b) 

Product Quality and Reliability

Why is it material

As the marine industry becomes more competitive, our 

customers rely on our brands for safe and quality products 

and services.  At AMOS, we believe in the importance of 

differentiation through the provision of products and services 

of high quality and reliability.  Through this, we aim to exceed 

the expectations of our customers and foster long-term 

relationships with them.

Management Approach

We adhere to international standards to ensure the quality and 

safety of our products and services.  We conduct and evaluate 

the periodic assessments of the health and safety impacts of 

our products and services.  This aids in identifying, assessing 

and treating all quality and safety-related risks associated with 

our business activities, products and services in a responsible 

manner.

For Alcona Brand, one of key offering product range will be the 

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).  Durability and Safety 

are crucial requirements for customers purchasing these 

products.  As our customers highlight their specifications 

and certifications required for each product during the 

tender stage, we ensure that we meet their requirements and 

standards when offering our products to the customer.

The type of standards and certification requirements are 

supported with testing and accreditation from the respective 

appointed testing bodies, along with certificate of conformity 

from AMOS.

G O V E R N A N C E

Sustainability Report 2021 | AMOS Group Limited  |  19 


Performance

In FY2021, there were no incidents of non-compliance with 

regulations and/or voluntary codes concerning the health and 

safety impacts of products and services within the reporting 

period.  We have not identified any non-compliance with 

regulations and/or voluntary codes with respect to health and 

safety impacts of our products and services.

Target

We aim to maintain stringent risk assessments of our products 

and services.  We strive to achieve zero reportable incidents of 

non-compliance concerning the health and safety impacts of 

products and services in the upcoming year.

(c) 

Ethics &amp; Anti-corruption

Why is it material

Good corporate governance is integral to building a reliable 

corporate, enabling transparency, and ensuring longevity. 

Corporate governance is imperative in protecting the 

company and its stakeholders against fraudulent and corrupt 

behaviours, amongst other foreseeable risks within the marine 

industry.  As we uphold integrity and trust across all our 

stakeholders, we acknowledge the detrimental impacts of any 

failures in compliance.

Management Approach

At AMOS, we are committed to maintaining a high standard 

of corporate governance.  We expect honesty, integrity, 

and accountability at every level of the company.  AMOS 

has established internal controls to ensure the highest 

standards of governance &amp; fraud prevention.  The Board and 

the Management believe that an effective whistle-blowing 

arrangement will act as a deterrent to malpractice and 

wrongdoing, encourage openness, promote transparency, 

underpin the risk management systems of AMOS, and enhance 

its business practice; thereby increasing the reputation of 

AMOS and its management.  We conduct yearly internal audit 

to ensure compliance.  Cases of non-compliance are directly 

reported to our Audit committee.  Employees, suppliers, 

customers, and other stakeholders can directly write-in to our 

Audit Committee to report cases of fraud or other irregularities. 

These reported cases are thoroughly investigated followed by 

the undertaking of subsequent necessary actions.

The specific objectives of the policy are:

● 

to maintain a high standard of corporate governance.

● 

to provide a channel of communication to the 

employees of AMOS to report fraudulent practices and 

to guide employees on actions to address their concerns 

on suspicious fraudulent activities.

● 

to provide a process in investigations and management 

reporting.

The whistle-blowing policy can be found on our website with 

details on the scope of the policy, the whistle blowing officer, 

what is not covered in the policy, administration, and whistle-

blowing procedures.

Performance

In FY2021, there was a case of ‘Misappropriation’ at AMOS.  The 

case involved an employee who was involved with unrecorded 

sales proceeds within the company.  Upon discovery, AMOS’s 

Board of Directors took the following actions:

● 

Terminated the employment of the employee

● 

Conducted preliminary investigations, commissioned an 

external provider to investigate the case and is currently 

in consultation with relevant advisors on next steps 

following a review of the findings

● 

Engaged internal and external auditors to conduct an 

independent review of the Group’s internal controls in 

light of the Misappropriation whilst considering if an 

increase in the scope of internal controls of the Group is 

required so as to protect against a repeat of this incident

● 

Considering legal recourses available in relation to this 

matter; including the making of a police report, amongst 

others, in respect of the Misappropriation.

We have taken this incident extremely seriously and will 

continue to enhance our controls and processes to avoid such 

lapses in future.

Target

We aim to ensure zero reportable incidents relating to 

corruption and bribery in FY2022.
