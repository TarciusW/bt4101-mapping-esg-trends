MESSAGE FROM BOARD 

BOARD STATEMENT 

 

 

Yanlord has a stellar track record in delivering high-quality development projects to our customers. To 

show our commitment towards sustainable development, we have taken the first step in this inaugural 

sustainability report to disclose our sustainability accomplishments for 2017 and improvement targets 

for the following year. 

While we look forward to economic performance in the forthcoming years, we are equally responsible to 

incorporate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors into our sustainability strategy. We 

have conducted stakeholder engagement sessions in 2017 to determine the material ESG factors of our 

business. These factors are used to develop the content of this report.  

At Yanlord, we look after the well-being of our employees by upholding occupational health and safety 

(OHS) at our workplace. We strive to comply with all applicable legislation, policies and management 

systems to foster a safe and healthy work environment. To ensure that our employees return home 

safely, we strive to minimise OHS-related incidents amongst our employees throughout the year. 

We extend the same care to our customers by ensuring the health and safety aspect is taken into 

consideration during every phase of our property development. Similarly, we strive to comply with all 

relevant regulations, policies and management system to safeguard the health and safety of our 

customers. Every year, we strive to have neither non-compliance nor health and safety incidents for our 

customers. 

At the same time, we always listen to the needs of our customers. To obtain valuable feedbacks, we 

engaged an independent and reputable agency to conduct regular surveys and subsequently analysed 

for follow-up actions. Through the development of safe and conducive living environments, Yanlord 

seeks to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction by meeting and exceeding the expectations of 

its customers.  

Most importantly, we have been advocating sustainable development in where we operate. Yanlord has 

a stellar track record in delivering high-quality green projects in PRC. By introducing the practice of 

developing fully furnished apartments and standard property management services into Mainland China, 


5 

 

Yanlord has been credited by the government – at the central, provincial and municipal level – as the 

standard-bearer for responsible and environment-friendly development.  

In 2001, Yanlord Gardens in Shanghai was certified as one of the first triple-A residential projects by 

the Ministry of Construction1. Later in 2009, we led a Singapore-based consortium into a large-scale 

urbanization project in collaboration with the local state-asset development companies. With Yanlord 

assuming the leadership in master planning and operational management, the joint venture is to 

transform a 15-km2 rural island in Yangtze River into a vibrant modern township, characterized with 

high-quality development and preservation of natural environment. One of the key indices for the 

development is that the surface water in the island will be upgraded to Grade III water2, which is suitable 

for direct contact with human bodies. 

We are proud that the Yanlord Landmark in Chengdu has also attained LEED-EB certification. At the 

highest rating of Platinum level, this certification is a globally recognised symbol of outstanding 

achievement in sustainable development. With over 10 years of constant perseverance for certification, 

we are serious about sustainability in what we do. We intend to catalyse on the exemplary achievement 

in Yanlord Landmark Plaza in driving similar initiatives to our entire property portfolio.  

With the start of our sustainability journey, we look forward to improving our business performance by 

building responsibly, while keeping our key ESG factors at the forefront.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 

ABOUT THIS REPORT 

This sustainability report aims to disclose our sustainable performance in the Environment, Social and 

Governance (ESG) aspects to our stakeholders in a transparent and accountable manner.  

For our inaugural report, we have chosen to report in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative 

(GRI) Standards: Core option, an international standard for sustainability reporting unveiled by GRI in 

2016.  

This report captures our sustainability efforts, initiatives and agendas from 1 January 2017 to 31 

December 2017, unless stated otherwise. We intend to continue reporting on our performance annually. 

Although this report has not been externally assured, we intend to seek external assurance for future 

sustainability reports. 

 

REPORTING SCOPE AND BOUNDARIES 

 

 

This report covers the sustainability performance of Yanlord’s main operations in PRC, Hong Kong, and 

Singapore. Furthermore, this report was defined by the reporting principles established by GRI 

Standards: Stakeholder Inclusiveness, Sustainability Context, Materiality, and Completeness. 

Stakeholder Inclusiveness principle was implemented to determine the report context through the 

stakeholder engagement and materiality assessment exercise conducted in August 2017.  

Sustainability Context principle was implemented to determine the report context which covered the 

ESG aspects. 

Materiality principle was implemented to determine the report context based on the internal and external 

factors that were considered when assessing whether a topic is material. 

Completeness principle was implemented to evaluate specific and material topics on data availability as 

well as to determine the topics’ boundaries.

OUR COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY 

 

Sustainability is high on our agenda. We are committed to delivering quality homes to our customers, 

through realising eco-friendly developments. Several of our properties are located in scenic areas that 

are also recognised by the government as sustainable properties. Residential properties of Yanlord 

Yunjie Riverside Gardens and Yanlord Riverside Gardens are not only recognised for their architectural 

design, but also won various awards for energy preservation technologies, landscaping, and quality.  

One of our key approaches to embracing sustainability in our operations is by managing both internal 

and external risks. The Board has overall responsibility for the governance of risk to ensure the sound 

system of risk management and internal controls. Comprising four members, the Risk Management 

Committee identifies, measures, manages, and controls risks that may have a significant impact on the 

Group’s property development activities. The committee is also responsible for reviewing and assessing 

risk related policies and methodologies. 

Our Group acts in accordance with the code of business conduct policy which deals with issues such as 

confidentiality, conduct and work discipline, corporate gifts and concessionary offers. Clear policies and 

guidelines on how to handle workplace harassment and grievances are also in place. We also have a 

whistleblowing policy in place to provide sufficient channels for our staff and any other persons to provide 

their feedback about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting, accounting or auditing, 

internal controls or internal accounting controls and other operational matters.  

We do not tolerate any form of corruption and bribery, especially our dealings with third-party vendors 

and suppliers. To prevent corruption, we have an anti-corruption policy in place which sets out the 

principles on how we conduct our business. Our corporate governance procedures are in line with this 

policy to ensure our Group behaves in a socially responsible manner. Vendors and suppliers are required 

to sign agreements/contracts with sections on anti-corruption and anti-bribery.  

Our agreements with vendors and suppliers go beyond anti-corruption and bribery to ensure that the 

products and services sourced are of high quality and standards. Contractors are appointed on the 

criteria of safety and a good record of compliance with regulations. Contractors are required to abide by 

Yanlord’s policies on health and safety and use personal protective equipment, report on accidents and 

ensure that waste matter has been disposed of properly.  

Yanlord is committed to upholding high corporate governance standards. The Group is also committed 

to ensuring workplace health and safety and is a member of the Workplace Safety and Health Council 

(Construction and Landscape) Committee, in Singapore.  

We have also undertaken several corporate social responsibility initiatives. These include holding several 

engagement programs for students and youths such as the enrichment program. In addition, we have 

provided grants and donations to educational institutions and other non-profit organisations.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

 

Throughout 2017, we engaged our key stakeholders through various channels to inform them of our 

sustainability initiatives, and at the same time, gathered their expectations and concerns on the 

sustainability of our business. These key stakeholders were chosen based on their ability to influence 

our performance and provide effective solutions to incorporate sustainability into our operations.  

These stakeholders include investors, business partners, suppliers, local communities, customers, 

media, and employees. The concerns raised by them during engagement have been compiled and 

prioritised based on sustainability considerations and their impact on the business.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

 

Expectations of the stakeholders and sustainability-related concerns raised by them during engagement 

were gathered to identify the material Environmental, Social and Governance factors, which was 

subsequently mapped to the GRI list of aspects. The aspects mapped were then given priority based on 

their impact on the business and how important stakeholders considered each aspect. The aspects that 

shared high importance for both the stakeholders, as well as the business, were validated by Yanlord’s 

top management.

CARING FOR OUR CUSTOMERS 

One of Yanlord’s top priority is ensuring the health and safety of customers in all our development 

properties. The health and safety aspect for our customers is well thought of at every stage of the 

property development. This is essential to avoid injuries, maintain a healthy environment within our 

properties and avoid compliance breaches. We are devoted to identifying all possible hazards that our 

customers can encounter and mitigate such hazards at an early stage.   

We have set aside several policies to manage this aspect. Our company policy has provisions on 

safeguarding the health and safety of customers for avoiding accidents and non-compliance of 

regulations. We are working on enhancing the accessibility of people of different age groups and mobility 

within our properties built. We have the special infrastructures in place – such as ramps, boarding bays 

and public toilets – to cater to groups concerned.  

We also believe that open and green spaces for customers within the built environment enhance 

aesthetics and customer satisfaction. These greeneries not only improve the urban environment but 

also the wellbeing of our customers. All our properties have large open spaces and lush natural greenery. 

Yanlord Townhouse is an example of our “natural” properties. It is situated within the wetland ecological 

conservation zone in Shanghai. The property capitalises on the natural tranquillity of its surroundings 

which is coupled with proximity to the amenities of cosmopolitan living.   

Entry and exit of our properties are also located closely to transport hubs such as bus stops and train 

stations. Proximity to transport hubs enables easy and convenient commute and easy access to all 

amenities. Our properties of Yanlord Western Gardens is an example that is ideally situated between 

Hongqiao CBD &amp; Transportation Hub in Qingpu New Town.    

In 2017, there were no incidences of non-compliance concerning the health and safety issues in our 

properties, as well as no cases of non-compliance with voluntary codes concerning either occupational 

health and safety or product and service information.  

We have set some goals and targets to ensure customer health and safety practices are followed in 

our properties as given below:  

 

We strive to have: 

 

ZERO incidents involving negative effect to health and safety for our customers 

 

ZERO cases of non-compliance with voluntary codes concerning either occupational 

health and safety or product and service information 

 


 

14 

 

CARING FOR OUR PEOPLE 

 

We believe that building people within the organization is crucial to building our business.  At Yanlord, 

we consider people as the backbone holding up our business and strive to ensure that our employees 

are always taken care of. We abide by PRC’s Labour Law and Safe Production Law, among others, for 

ensuring the health and safety of our employees.  

Our policy on health and safety has been developed to safeguard our employees. We have a systematic 

way of reporting any incidents of injury or accident taken place in our properties. For construction sites, 

any incidents will be reported to project managers for immediate treatment. For managed properties, 

any incidents will be reported to the respective property manager. All cases of incident will be 

documented by our human resources department for the processing of leaves and insurance payout. 

In 2017, we had 23 incidents reported, which translates into less than 80 lost days per million hours 

worked. There were no cases of occupational diseases and work-related fatalities in the same year. 

To continue the emphasis on managing workplace health and safety in our business, we have outlined 

goals and targets to better manage health and safety concerns of our employees. We will follow up 

closely and report on our progress in the next report.

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION 

We are dedicated to designing and creating high-quality properties. Our properties are characterised by 

outstanding architectural design and quality construction. We actively try to identify and address the 

needs of our customers. This commitment underpins our brand and provides the necessary foundation 

for a harmonious community. 

We recognise the value of customer feedback, as it allows us to understand the experience of our 

customers and inform how we can improve our products services to better meet their needs. We 

engaged an independent research agency that is well-known in PRC to conduct regular surveys for all 

our customers – the buyers of our development properties, the tenants of our office buildings, service 

apartments and retails shops, as well as the guests of our service apartments and hotels. The survey 

results are later analysed for any potential gaps and areas of improvement, with the appropriate follow-

up actions after the analysis.  

Our proactive approach has ensured that we achieve high satisfaction level at all stages of services to 

our customers. The table below shows the satisfaction level rated by our customer, which we have been 

given scoring that exceeds the industry’s average. We will always strive to achieve better satisfaction 

level than our peers, which are represented by the industrial average scores.

SUSTAINABLE GREEN DEVELOPMENTS 

 

In 2016, an estimated 54.5 per cent of the world’s population lived in urban settlements. By 2030, it is 

estimated that urban areas are projected to house 60 per cent of people globally1. As a property 

developer, Yanlord’s focus is on building green infrastructure that supports sustainable development for 

growing communities. The sustainable infrastructure includes thorough site planning, environmental 

friendly materials usage, innovative design to reduce energy and water consumption, and indoor 

environmental quality maintenance. 

Developing sustainable infrastructure can be assured through green ratings and certifications. Located 

in Chengdu, Sichuan Province in PRC, Yanlord Landmark has been awarded LEED-EB Platinum. This 

certification ensures reduction of wastage of energy and resources in the building and improvement of 

the indoor air quality within the buildings thereby improving the comfort level within the buildings. The 

certification also ensures increased work efficiency and satisfaction of office workers within the building. 

Most importantly, the certification helps align sustainability development goals for both property owners 

and tenants.  

Yanlord Landmark is an example of future developments in urban areas. Sustainable property 

development commences with purchasing green materials for developing properties, separation of 

waste, and sustainable housekeeping and maintenance, amongst others. Yanlord Landmark has been 

successful in pest management, erosion control, landscape management, and in reducing outdoor 

parking. Environmental systems in place such as water-saving features in toilets and the installation of 

meters to control water dispensed, affirms our commitment to reduce water consumption.  

Yanlord is committed to developing properties with LEED or equivalent green certifications to support 

sustainable development. Currently, Yanlord looks after the environment surrounding the property sites, 

resource usage (material and energy), and other aspects such as indoor air quality and educating the 

community on practicing sustainability within the properties.

CARING FOR OUR COMMUNITY 

At Yanlord, we have been actively organising charity events for the differently abled and the 

underprivileged communities, as well as various activities for the environment. In addition to achieving 

high standards of investor relations, good corporate citizenry is another key focus of the Company. 

Building on our commitment to delivering quality homes to our discerning customers, we continue to 

focus on environmental conservation through developing eco-friendly developments. Our corporate 

social responsibilities also extend to student and youth engagement programs such as grants and 

donations to educational institutes as well as enrichment programs for students. Building on our earlier 

initiatives to enhance understanding of the Chinese business environment amongst Singapore students, 

our Group had in FY 2017 welcomed an additional 2 batches comprising approximately 100 students 

and staff from Nanyang Polytechnic to our residential and commercial developments in Chengdu. 

 

SPECIAL FUND FOR THE VISUALLY-IMPAIRED 

Our Shanghai unit raised over RMB 3 million as a donation for the visually impaired on 31 May 2017 in 

Shanghai. The key beneficiary for this initiative was Shanghai Fudan University Education Development 

Foundation and the Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital.  

 

 

HELPING THE ELDERLY 

In 2017, our Shenzhen unit raised a total of RMB 1 million to support the elderly. We supported two 

charitable organisations, namely 深圳市爱联股份合作有限公司、深圳市龙岗区龙城道爱联社区老年人协会 for 

this cause.  

 

CONTRIBUTION FOR SPORTS 

For the 13th PRC National Games held in September 2017, our Tianjin unit contributed printers and 

consumables for the event. This initiative was to support sports within the country.
