1.A. Corporate Profile 

 

Atlantic Navigation Holdings (Singapore) Limited (the “Company” and together 

with its subsidiaries, the “Atlantic Group”) is listed on the Catalist board (“Catalist”) of the 

Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”).

GRI: 102-2: Activities, brands, products, and services 

 

GRI: 102-7: Scale of the organization 

 

The Atlantic Group’s history dates back to 1997 when our operations began under 

Atlantic Marine Services LLC (“AMS LLC”) in Dubai, UAE. The principal business 

activities of AMS LLC were to provide ship repair, fabrication and other marine services 

to ship owners in the UAE region.  The Atlantic Group has since evolved from a ship repair, 

fabrication and other marine services provider to a ship owner and integrated offshore 

service provider. 

 

 

We manage our operations mainly through our subsidiaries, namely Atlantic 

Maritime Group FZE (based in Hamriyah Free Zone, Sharjah, UAE) and Atlantic Ship 

Management LLC (based in Abu Dhabi, UAE). 

 

Listed on the Catalist, the Company had changed its name to Atlantic Navigation 

Holdings (Singapore) Limited on 31 July 2012, following the completion of the reverse 

acquisition by Fastube Limited. 

 

Over the years, our dedicated services have enabled us to establish strong and stable 

relationships with various leading oil companies, offshore contractors, survey companies, 

ship owners, ship yards and ship brokers/charterers in the region.

1.B. Strategy 

 

1.B.i. General Strategy &amp; Outlook 

 

Given the continuing subdued and volatility in oil prices, the Atlantic Group 

continues to exercise management prudence in its operations. While the general 

sentiments have improved with slight increase in enquiries for the Atlantic Group’s 

marine logistics services, the Atlantic Group expects continuing competitive pressure 

on charter rates due to the influx of excess tonnages from other more adversely affected 

regions into the Middle East. 

 

Given the established track record and entrenched market presence in the 

Middle East, while efforts are focused on sustaining the utilization rates of its owned-

fleet, the Atlantic Group will continue to explore opportunities for cross chartering-in 

of third party vessels backed by secured contracts to complement its fleet and service 

offering to generate positive cash flows and profits for the Atlantic Group. 

 

1.B.ii. Operational Outlook 

 

The Atlantic Group continues to exercise management prudence in its operations 

and expects to continue to focus on improving its operational efficiencies, while optimizing 

and reducing its cost of operations as it pursues new contracts with its established pool of 

existing and new clients. 

 

The Atlantic Group continues to focus on maintaining and protecting the enhanced 

level of utilization of its existing fleet and securing employment for its owned vessels at 

competitive market rates. 

 

Having progressively taken full delivery of the 7 new-built vessels by January 2019, 

we have now a fleet of vessels which are relatively new of less than 4 years old on average, 

if we disregard the old legacy vessels comprising of a utility vessel, 2 tugboats and 1 

remaining deck cargo barge estimated as at 31 March 2019.  

 

While our intention is to limit our capital expenditure in view of the general market 

condition as well as the demand and supply dynamics, we will continue to evaluate our 

fleet portfolio in accordance of the needs of the market with a view of continual fleet 

renewal in our bid to remain streamlined and focused with the ultimate aim of being nimble 

and competitive in our service offerings.

1.B.iii. Specific Goals, Plans &amp; Strategy Elements 

 

In view of the general strategy and with regards to the outlook of the industry, we intend 

to embark or follow through on the following: 

 

1) Having taking delivery of the 7 new vessels for a MENOC’s 10 vessels project, the 

Atlantic Group intends to continue to work towards maintaining or improving its 

overall utilization of the enlarged fleet. 

 

2) The Atlantic Group intends to increase in geographic presence in selected countries in 

the Middle East and North Africa (“MENA”) region given its understanding and track 

record with a view to improve the daily charter rates and profitability. 

 

3) The Atlantic Group intends to diversify its customer base in two broad categories (i) 

securing contracts with National Oil Companies (“NOCs”), and (ii) working through 

established EPC contractors with extensive international operations.    

 

4) The Atlantic Group intends to explore avenues to enhance its presence in KSA, both 

administratively and operationally, so as to compete more effectively for new contracts, 

while focusing on one of our largest clients: Saudi Aramco.  

 

5) Depending on the operational requirements, the Atlantic Group intends to reduce the 

use of leverage and reduce its interest cost. 

 

6) Having recently completed the US$45 million deconstruction project with our joint 

venture partner, the Atlantic Group intends to build on this track record and evaluate 

opportunities with strategic partners on such collaborative projects to diversify our 

business operations. 

 

7) The Atlantic Group intends to invest in system, processes and training for higher 

efficiency and cost effectiveness, especially in our administrative and operational 

departments. 

 

8) The Atlantic Group intends to continue to review its cost base with a view to lower 

operational expenditures, without compromising on operational and service quality.

GRI: 102-14: Statement from senior decision-maker 

 

GRI: 102-32: Highest governance body’s role in sustainability reporting 

 

Board Statement 

 

The board of directors (the “Board” or the “Directors”) of the Company is of the 

view that this sustainability report provides a reasonable and transparent presentation of 

the Company’s sustainability performance, specifically shedding light on its 

environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) impacts. In this respect, we affirm that our 

sustainability reporting is in compliance with the second year reporting requirements under 

the Catalist Rules. 

 

This statement also conforms with Singapore Code of Corporate Governance 

(issued on May 2, 2012) (the “CG Code”), and specifically Principle 1 of the CG Code, 

which states that the Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success of the 

Company. In line with Guideline 1.1 of the CG Code, we affirm that that the Board has 

fulfilled its role in considering and determining the material sustainability issues 

throughout this report, and has considered and will continue to consider and further assess 

ESG factors on an ongoing basis of the Atlantic Group’s strategic formulation and 

direction. 

 

The Board’s interaction with management has enabled us to satisfy ourselves on 

the way sustainability governance is structured and functioning through the various levels 

of management. In this regard, we currently provide oversight over management through 

the lens of sustainability performance, and aspire to improve by reviewing on a quarterly 

basis the Atlantic Group’s material ESG factors.   

 

Concerning future reporting, the Board will continue to work with the management 

in order to determine what needs to be done to improve sustainability reporting with a view 

in attaining full compliance under the Catalist Rules and the adoption of Global Reporting 

Initiative (“GRI”) reporting framework.

1.D. Ethics &amp; Integrity 

 

 

GRI: 102-16: Values, principles, standards, and norms of behavior 

 

We recognize that our industry is sensitive in the area of ethics and corruption. Any 

such issues can lead to significant reputational damage, legal consequences and loss of 

customers to our business.  

 

We have no tolerance for bribery and corruption in our business. We aim to achieve 

the highest levels of corporate ethics and transparency through sound corporate governance 

and appropriate internal controls. 

 

In addition, we have put in place a whistle-blowing policy, issued since February 

2013, whereby employees may, in confidence, report possible improprieties that may cause 

financial or non-financial loss of the Company, including but not limited to fraud, 

misappropriation of assets, sexual harassment, criminal breach of trust, corruption, 

questionable or improper accounting, misuse of confidential information, breach of 

Atlantic Group’s policies and authorities, and acts or omissions which are deemed to be 

against the interest of the Atlantic Group, laws, regulations or public policies. Whistle 

blowers could call and/or email to the Whistle Blowing Committee directly and in 

confidence, and his/her identity is protected from reprisals within the limit of the law.  

 

All employees have access to top management, providing communication channels 

that reach the Chairman of the Board and the CEO who will be informed of any material 

incidents raised. 

 

Our employees are briefed and have received communication on our whistle-

blowing policy. There have been no cases of whistle-blowing in the Atlantic Group during 

the reporting period. The Atlantic Group will continue to maintain the whistle-blowing 

policy and other internal controls in place to prevent wrongful acts.

2.A. Stakeholder Engagement 

 

 

GRI: 102-46: Defining report content and topic boundaries  

 

In order to report on the material ESG topics for Atlantic Group, it is important to 

first determine the important stakeholders that will form the basis of these topics. This is 

done through a stakeholder-centered approach that follows the following process: 

 

 

Stakeholder-Centered Approach to Materiality 

 

 

 

 

1



• List potential stakeholders, classified as external or internal.

2



• Impact matrix to identify high, medium, and low impact stakeholders.

3



• List engagement methods for each stakeholder, based on impact 

importance.

4



• Engage with the relevant stakeholders to conduct impact rating on a list of 

potentially material ESG factors.

5



• Create a materiality matrix that identifies each material topic according to 

the stakeholder impact rating results and other best-practice benchmarking 

results.

6



• Align the material topics to sustainability frameworks (in this case, GRI &amp; 

UNSDGs) to highlight their ESG elements.

7



• Report on each material ESG factor identified, focusing on the high-

intensity topics on the materiality matrix.


 

24 

 



• Step 1: 

 

 

GRI: 102-40: List of stakeholder groups  

 

The Atlantic Group interacts with and impacts (directly and indirectly) a variety 

of stakeholder groups. An assessment resulted in the list of 9 potentially relevant 

stakeholders below, classified as to whether they are internal or external to the 

organization: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

GRI: 102-41: Collective bargaining agreements 

 

The Atlantic Group does not have any collective bargaining agreements with 

employees or other stakeholders.

• Step 2: 

 

 

GRI: 102-42: Identifying and selecting stakeholders  

 

After listing the 3 internal and 6 external stakeholder groups that could be 

potentially relevant, another assessment was done to determine the stakeholders’ relevance 

based on the impact they have on us, as well as the impact we have on them. A further step 

adds a column on the right that helps determine the type of engagement with each 

stakeholder group, based on the impact intensity (to be discussed in Step 3). The results 

are illustrated in the below Stakeholder Impact Matrix:

26 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The results of the stakeholder impact matrix show that stakeholders with highest-

intensity impact on and from the Atlantic Group are 1 external stakeholder group 

(customers) and 2 internal stakeholder groups (employees and management). 

 

• Step 3: 

 

 

GRI: 102-43: Approach to stakeholder engagement 

 

After identifying the relevant stakeholders, the Atlantic Group determines how 

these stakeholders are engaged. Using the same stakeholder impact matrix in Step 2, the 

type of engagement can be determined according to the intensity of impact, where the types 

of engagement (from highest impact to lowest impact stakeholders) are: empower, 

collaborate, involve, consult, and inform. 

 

The results of the stakeholder impact matrix (along with engagement types) show 

that customers, employees, and management, along with shareholders should be engaged 

in an empowering way, since their involvement is very highly significant to the operations 

of the Atlantic Group. This means that our actions should not be aimed at simply 

communicating with these stakeholders, but also empowering them to be able to reap the 

optimal benefits for both us and them. Customers could be empowered through Atlantic 

Group events and delivery of superb quality of service, employees and management could 

be empowered through training, events, certain policies &amp; procedures, etc while 

shareholders are provided with periodic results announcements and timely disclosure of 

material events. 

 

Next in significant are government / regulators as well as suppliers who should be 

engaged with in a collaborative way. This means that they are not too significant to directly 

allocate our resources to in order to empower, yet they are significant enough to collaborate

with rather than just simply communicate with. This can be done by having Atlantic Group 

representatives meeting with government representatives / regulators and suppliers in a 

productive and meaningful way, especially to hear the concerns of both parties and work 

together towards maximizing the benefits of each. With regard to competitors, as their 

operations compete and hence impact our business, we monitor our competitors’ 

development and aspire to compete effectively with an efficient fleet and excellent services 

delivery while at the same time, explore ways to selectively work on cross charter-in 

opportunities given our entrenched position in the Middle East and MENOCs.     

 

The rest of the stakeholders should be involved with Atlantic Group—i.e. not only 

communicated with in an informative or consultative manner, but rather directly engaged 

with especially with our creditors which have supported the operations of the Atlantic 

Group.    

 

Next, after determining the engagement category for the appropriate stakeholders, 

the next table lists the specific engagement methods Atlantic Group applies towards each 

of these stakeholder groups:

2.B. Identification of Material Topics 

 

 

GRI: 102-44: Key topics and concerns raised 

 

After determining the most significant stakeholders and their engagement methods, 

the next step is to use the input from these stakeholders, to determine ESG topics that are 

most material to them. Selected internal stakeholders, especially employees and 

management, were engaged by doing an impact rating of a list of potentially material ESG 

topics. Material topics were discussed and compared to previous results, and stakeholders 

were asked to rate the current importance of these topics based on various dimensions of 

impact. Impact rating was done on a scale of 0 to 3, meaning: 

 

• 0: No impact 

• 1: Low impact 

• 2: Medium impact 

• 3: High impact 

 

The table below shows how stakeholders rate the 7 preliminary topics across various 

dimensions:

2.C. Materiality Matrix 

 

 

GRI: 102-47: List of material topics 

 

After having identified the most material ESG topics to stakeholders derived from 

internal stakeholders, the next step is to create a materiality matrix. This matrix has the 

internal stakeholders’ ratings on the x-axis, and the y-axis maps these material topics with 

external sources to determine their importance. Specifically, these external sources include 

benchmarking / best practice of how these material topics (or similar topics) were rated in 

other materiality matrices in various other sustainability reports.

2.D. Sustainability Reporting Frameworks 

 

 

GRI: 102-54: Claims of reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards 

 

After identifying the material topics with their materiality levels, the next step is to 

map each topic with its associated sustainability frameworks, in order to highlight on each 

one’s ESG elements. In this case, the topics are mapped to GRI indicators, as well as to 

UNSDGs. 

 

Additionally, this is to also note that besides material topic alignment to GRI, GRI 

is also the foundational basis upon which this report is prepared and even structured. 

Specifically, Parts 1 &amp; 2 are structured on GRI General Disclosures, while Parts 3, 4, and 

5 are structured on Topic-Specific GRI’s. 

 

Furthermore, though it is not required by the Catalist Rules, this report is aligned 

with the “Core” GRI requirements, meaning the core GRI indicators have been addressed. 

In terms of future sustainability reports, we aim to at least provide core GRI level and 

preferably “Comprehensive” level in the near future.

3.A. Material Topic #1: Quality, Health, Safety, and Environment (QHSE) 

 

3.A.1. Current policies, practices and performance 

 

QHSE at the Atlantic Group 

 

The Atlantic Group believes that the safe operation of vessels, safety of its 

employees (including contractors and all persons working under its control), together with 

the public, as well as the protection of the environment, are the overriding responsibilities 

and considerations in carrying out its diverse marine operations. 

 

The Atlantic Group maintains strict quality control programs to monitor and control 

its operational risks. We remain focused on increasing QHSE awareness among our 

employees and crew, and on upholding our core values in our daily operational activities. 

Structured safety meetings are held and safety trainings were organized for them 

throughout the year. 

 

The Stop Work policy of the Atlantic Group provides responsibility and authority 

to all employees or contractors to stop an activity, if, in his/her opinion or judgement, the 

activity is deemed to be an unsafe or risky behavior. 

 

Atlantic Maritime Group FZE (“AMG”) has successfully aligned its safety 

management system from OHSAS 18001:2008 to the new standard ISO 45001:2018. AMG 

follows a risk based approach and proactive method of implementing control measures or 

taking preventive actions to achieve its goal of zero accidents. 

 

The commitment of the Atlantic Group in ensuring the safety of employees, the 

protection of environment, and the continual improvement are evident from the statistics 

showing zero Lost Time Injury (“LTI”), and zero oil spills in the past 5 years. 

 

Global &amp; Industrial Standards 

 

As one of the leading offshore companies operating mainly in the Middle East, The 

Atlantic Group is fully committed to implementing and complying with all of the standards, 

regulations and statutory requirements codes from: 

 

• International Maritime Organization (“IMO”) conventions 

• International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (“SOLAS”) 

• Internal Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”)  

• Other conventions directly or indirectly related to safety and the environment in full  

 

The Atlantic Group complies with these standards; class certifications are received 

for the vessels. Specifically, IMO and MARPOL are applicable to all vessels; SOLAS is 

applicable to most vessels but not all the vessels. 


 

36 

 



 

Client Standards 

 

All of our key clients and their EPC subcontractors are required to comply fully 

with all the international regulations related to ESG (especially environmental) 

compliance, and also to meet and comply with their own specific standards and 

requirements. Most of these specific standards and requirements deal with their QHSE 

policies.  

 

Our Compliance 

 

The Atlantic Group’s fleet of vessels comply fully with these regulations, standards 

and specific requirements from our clients and international/industrial/marine standards. 

Most importantly, we have achieved zero LTI and zero oil spills in the past 5 years. 

 

 

GRI: 102-13: Membership of associations 

 

The Atlantic Group has various QHSE-related standards and accreditations, including:

We would like to highlight that we comply with all the required mandatory QHSE 

requirements and to have taken further steps to ensure that the Atlantic Group abides by 

the highest QHSE standards. We also actively engage and hence comply with other 

additional QHSE requirements from our clients, and receive audit reports concerning our 

level of compliance.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.A.2. Future plans &amp; targets 

 


 

37 

 



Proactive Compliance 

 

Compliance with various QHSE standards is critical to continue to serve our 

existing contracts and to secure and tender for new contracts from clients—whether 

existing and new. In order to ensure this into the future, we strive to not only meet the 

current standards, but to also proactively anticipate and prepare our fleet for any future 

possible QHSE standards that may arise—whether from clients or from global/industrial 

initiatives. In order to achieve this proactive compliance, we constantly keep ourselves 

updated with QHSE impacts through close interactions across the operational divisions, 

and continuously plan for and implement new measures for improving QHSE elements 

within our operations.  

 

Sulphur Content Limitations in Fuel 

 

Under the revised MARPOL Annex VI, the global sulphur limit in fuel will be 

reduced from current 3.50% to 0.50% m/m, effective from 1 January 2020, subject to a 

feasibility review to be completed no later than 2018. The 70th Marine Environmental 

Protection Committee (MEPC), held on October 2016, considered an assessment of fuel 

oil availability to inform the decision to be taken by the parties to MARPOL Annex VI, 

and decided that the fuel oil standard (0.50% m/m sulphur limit) shall become effective on 

1 January 2020. The limits applicable in Emission Control Areas (ECAs) for Sulphur 

oxides (SOx) and particulate matter (PM) were reduced to 0.10% m/m, from 1 January 

2015. 

 

With respect to the Atlantic Group managed fleet, our vessels are using Low 

sulphur Marine Gas Oil (“MGO”) and complying fully with the low sulphur requirement 

standard. The MGO sulphur content ranges from 0.01% to 0.10% m/m which we actively 

monitor through bunker delivery notes which would indicate the percentage of sulphur at 

all bunkering operations. 

 

International Energy Efficiency Certificates (“IEEC”)  

 

Ship exhaust gases can not only be reduced by the use of higher quality fuels or 

exhaust gas cleaning systems, but also by increasing the energy efficiency of a ship. For 

this reason, the IMO has adopted an amendment to MARPOL Annex VI with effect from 

2010 to increase the energy efficiency. According to this amendment, all new ships must 

now possess a so-called Energy Efficiency Design Index (“EEDI”) with effect from 2013 

which is an index indicating the CO2 emissions per ton of cargo and nautical mile sailed.  

 

The above EEDI index calculations do not apply to our fleet as they do not belong 

to the sub-categories of ships as defined under the regulations. However, as per other 

amendments of MARPOL Annex VI, vessels require IEEC to certify that they are in 

compliance with requirements of having a ship energy efficiency management plan 

(“SEEMP”) onboard. All of our vessels where such compliance is applicable have received 

the IEEC certification and carry respective SEEMP onboard. The contents of each SEEMP 

include the following items:

4.A. Material Topic #2: Succession Planning 

 

4.A.1. Current policies, practices and performance 

 

The Atlantic Group recognizes that succession planning for the Board and key 

management positions can be a long-drawn process, with the successors having to spend 

time understanding and managing different aspects / departments of the Atlantic Group's 

business in order to ensure proper, smooth knowledge and skill transfer. 

 

With regard to succession planning of the Board of Directors, in selecting potential 

new directors, the Nominating Committee (“NC”) will seek to identify the competencies 

required to enable the Board to fulfil its responsibilities. The NC will evaluate the 

suitability of the nominee(s) or candidate(s) based on his/her qualifications, experience, 

commitment and ability to contribute to the Board process and such qualities and attributes 

that may be required by the Board. 

 

The succession planning process with regard to the members of Board of Directors 

are detailed on pages 25 to 26 of the Annual Report 2018. It should be noted that 4 out of 

the 5 current directors were recently re-elected (where 3 were recent appointees including 

the Chairman) on 26 April 2019 as an indication of strong board renewal process.  

 

 

Concerning the general issue of succession planning of the management, the 

management team provides the Board with an assessment on a regular basis as to the status 

and progress on its succession plans for key management positions. 

 

In general, succession planning in the Atlantic Group starts with identification of 

the right candidates to join the Group with the necessary experience, expertise and 

attributes with the potential to grow and take on more responsibilities. On-the-job training 

with the close supervision and guidance provided by the seniors ensure continual learning 

and alignment with corporate culture of the Atlantic Group.  

 

Succession planning for management, in particular for the Chief Executive Officer, 

Mr. Wong Siew Cheong (“Bill”), has been identified as a key risk, given that Bill is the 

founder and key shareholder since its formation some 17 years ago and had established a 

strong relationship in the Middle East with our clients and key suppliers. 

 

4.A.2. Future plans &amp; targets 

 

The Atlantic Group is striving to proactively address this issue of management 

succession planning, and had recently recruited senior appointments including a new Chief 

Operating Officer (“COO”) with experience in all areas of the Atlantic Group's business. 

Mr. Stoyan Radev Ialamov is the newly appointed COO and comes with much experience, 

bringing in capable professionals to manage specific divisions and operations. Mr.  Ialamov 

also internally promoted capable employees from operations to fleet management—which 


 

42 

 



is a testament to the heightened commitment to job training and guidance. Besides Mr. 

Ialamov, other new top management positions hired includes Mr. Hsu Chong Pin as the 

Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) with the necessary work and industry experience to 

complement the senior management team. 

 

Most significantly, following the completion of the investment by Saeed 

Investment Pte. Ltd., which is controlled by Mr. Kum Soh Har, Michael (“Mr. Kum”) and 

his spouse. Mr. Kum has since been appointed as the Non-Executive Non-Independent 

Chairman of the Company in December 2018. As an industry veteran with more than 40 

years of experience in the offshore oil and gas sector and in particular being an early entrant 

to the Middle East market, the appointment of Mr. Kum is expected to enhance the bench 

of experience and expertise of the Atlantic Group.  

 

The management team is expected to benefit from Mr. Kum’s strategic advice with 

respect to the expansion plans and financial strategy of the Atlantic Group and vast industry 

contacts who may be relevant and useful in recommending suitable senior candidates to 

lead the Atlantic Group through his vast industry contacts.   

 

4.A.3. Metrics 

 

To the extent that the Atlantic Group is able to provide quantitative data, it has 

provided or updated them. The reasons that some of quantitative numbers are not provided 

are mainly due to information which were not tracked and/or not available, sensitive 

information, difficult to quantify given their nature, and/or even if they are quantifiable, 

these information may no longer be meaningful as business operations evolve. These data 

in quantitative terms are hence not disclosed, but rather more appropriate to be disclosed 

in qualitative descriptions.

4.B. Material Topic #7: Localization 


 

43 

 



 

4.B.1. Current policies, practices and performance 

 

Importance of Localization 

 

 

The Atlantic Group must comply with the minimum local staffing requirements set 

by the various governments in countries we operate in and the clients that we work with. 

Specifically, the Atlantic Group must ensure that it is hiring ample numbers of Saudi and 

Emirati nationals, since our main operations are in the UAE and the KSA. 

 

Localization continues to be perceived as an opportunity than compliance 

requirements. It is a chance for us to learn about the local environment in which we operate, 

and also a chance to bolster our local image and local standing. Furthermore, since we are 

already established and complying to the localization requirements, this is currently an 

opportunity for us that may keep out potential market entrants in the region; in effect, the 

localization requirements act as a form of cabotage / enhanced barrier to entry that makes 

it more difficult for other foreign companies to comply, and, as a result, to secure business 

in the MENA region. 

 

On the other hand, while there is opportunity, there is also risk of non-compliance, 

in case we do not reach the required levels of localization. Besides compliance risk, we 

must also face the multi-ethnicity within our organization with persistent efforts to 

maintain cultural harmony within the organization as part of managing staff attrition rate 

and creating opportunities for personal development of all employees. 

 

The In-Kingdom Total Value Add (“IKTVA”) Program 

 

IKTVA is Saudi Aramco’s program for encouraging Saudi localization, the 

ultimate aim of which is to achieve 70% localization by the year 2021. IKTVA looks at 

various factors, such as localized goods and services, salaries paid to Saudis, training &amp; 

development to Saudis, etc. 

 

Since Saudi Aramco is one of Atlantic Group’s key clients, we are increasing our 

efforts to hire and train suitably qualified Saudi nationals in order to contribute towards 

IKTVA, and in return reap current and future benefits of working with Saudi Aramco. 

 

While it should be noted that the Atlantic Group is currently not obliged to comply 

to IKTVA, we currently have Saudi Arabian crew members under our payroll. However, 

as we evaluate the setting up a local direct presence in KSA to expand operations especially 

with Saudi Aramco, compliance with IKTVA is an important standard to consider as a 

priority. 

 

 

 

The In-Country Value (“ICV”) Program 

 


 

44 

 



 

ICV is ADNOC’s program for encouraging Emirati localization, aiming to improve 

knowledge transfer and create job opportunities for UAE nationals. As part of this, 

ADNOC requires its suppliers to declare their localization achievements by meeting 

several criteria to ultimately acquire the ICV certificate. This certificate is then verified by 

a third-party annually. 

 

Since ADNOC is also one of the Atlantic Group’s key clients, we ensure that we 

comply with the ICV by hiring adequate Emirati nationals and utilize the services of local 

suppliers to booster the compliance with the ICV certificate criteria, and in return reap 

current and future benefits of working with ADNOC. 

 

Our most recent ICV certificate was issued on 30 January 2019 and remains valid 

until 29 July 2020. The ICV certificate criteria and the applicability to us are outlined 

below:

 4.B.2. Future plans &amp; targets 

 

Saudi Localization 

 

With the view of enhancing our presence in Saudi Arabia together with our partners 

or through direct presence, we plan to grow both our operational and administrative staff 

to include more Saudi nationals. Specifically, we will continue to recruit and train more 

Saudi nationals as marine crew to ensure that we meet the quota for Saudi crew, specifically 

in vessels serving Saudi Aramco.  

 

Further, we plan to procure more services from approved Saudi contractors to meet 

our IKTVA targets. These efforts will become increasingly important as we further develop 

our presence in the KSA. 

 

Emirati Localization 

 

The Atlantic Group is aiming to continue to increase our ICV score by ensuring 

increase in local involvement by way of hiring Emirati nationals and increase procurement 

with local suppliers.

4.C. Material Topic #3: Political Risk 

 

4.C.1. Current policies, practices and performance 

 

Changes in the political environment have caused restrictions in access to a number 

of offshore fields and the associated activities and clients. In some cases, these changes 

directly resulted in unavailability of previously existing work opportunities and 

developments, and deeper isolation and restrictions in terms of accessing operating areas. 

 

In FY2018, Atlantic Group’s business had been further influenced by the impact of 

the political developments and rising tensions amongst countries within the Gulf region, as 

we had specifically been impacted in areas of availability and restrictions on procuring 

charter contracts, banking practices, procurement and logistics support in vessels operating 

in the region.  

 

With respect to political risk, our vessels are backed by the necessary business 

continuity and crisis management measures to be adopted in anticipation of emergencies. 

In this regard, in December 2017, our QHSE Division has implemented (from the ground 

up) a vessel crisis management—also called the rescue operations plan—which outlines a 

safety-related procedure to follow in case of an emergency. 

 

The rescue operations plan constitutes of the following elements:

We recognize that procuring insurance is a necessary approach towards mitigating 

politic risks. In this regard, we procure adequate insurance coverage especially in relation 

to marine war risk and only from reputable insurance companies and Protection &amp; 

Indemnity clubs. Furthermore, we include our clients, both NOCs/IOCs and EPC 

contractors as co-insured in our insurance policies. The types of insurance that we acquire 

include, but are not limited to, the following: 

 

# 

Type of Insurance 

1 

Hull &amp; Machinery (H&amp;M) 

2

4.C.2. Future plans &amp; targets 

 

 

It is not practical for the Atlantic Group to eliminate all risks by directly reducing 

the political risks in the country in which it operates given that the politic risks are outside 

of its control. Instead, we work towards mitigating the risk through other measures, such 

as risk avoidance, sharing, etc. Some ways in which we plan to deal with political risk 

include: 

 

i) We are planning to enhance our awareness, foresight, and impact assessments of political 

situations in the countries in which we operate, in order to proactively identify and prepare 

for potential political risks. 

 

ii) Coordinating with insurance companies in order to mitigate the political risks in a 

favorable manner. 

 

iii) Moving our operations away from politically risk locations to more politically stables 

ones.  

 

iv) Engaging consultants to adopt business continuity and crisis management measures, 

such as cold/warm/hot sites to protect data.

5.A. Material Topic #4: Profitability &amp; Cash Flow 

 

5.A.1. Current policies, practices and performance 

 

Financial Challenges 

 

Given the continuing subdued and volatility in oil prices, and general 

oversupply of vessels resulting in competitive pressures on charter rates, many offshore 

oil &amp; marine companies including the Atlantic Group have been under significant financial 

pressures. Various companies in the oil &amp; marine industry are undergoing restructuring 

processes, such as Chapter 11 bankruptcy protections, judicial managements and scheme 

of arrangements, and consensual restructuring with the creditors including some peer 

companies listed on the SGX-ST. 

 

The key reasons for the situation above is that while, for vessel owners, charter 

rates had collapsed significantly due to reduced demand while contending with oversupply 

of vessels in general, operators had also not been able to materially reduce operating 

expenses due to the need to continue to meet the stringent criteria and demands of the 

NOCs/IOCs—such as vessel requirements, employment requirements, etc. 

 

Cash flow position of vessel owners had severely weakened due to the continuing 

need to service loans and interest payment of assets that were purchased at a high price 

during the boom years (before oil prices crashed in 2015) and having to upkeep the running 

cost and maintenance of the vessels with the annual and special surveys. 

 

5.A.2. Future plans &amp; targets 

 

Our Response to Challenges 

 

The Company has recently completed the cash-for-equity investment of US$26 

million by Saeed Investment Pte. Ltd.. Apart from strengthening the equity base and cash 

flow position of the Atlantic Group, a significant proportion of the proceeds had been used 

to fully redeem the principal and interests under the SCF Convertible Loan Agreement in 

December 2018. This had resulted in a significant decrease in the use of leverage within 

the Atlantic Group and had strengthened our cash flow position to support various contracts 

secured including the US$236 million long-term contracts secured in FY2016 from a 

MENOC.  

 

Having taken delivery of all the 7 new-built vessels progressively by January 2019 

coupled with the recent general increase in utilization rate across the enlarged fleet, the 

Atlantic Group is positioning itself for improving performance in FY2019 over FY2018. 

 

 

 


 

51 

 



Specific Financial Plans 

 

The Atlantic Group's specific financial plans are as follows: 

 

1) Explore new markets within the MENA region with a view to broaden the client 

base to increase the daily charter rates and revenue 

 

2) Maintain and improve operational efficiencies to control or reduce cost for 

improved margins 

 

3) Sustain our enhanced utilization rates  

 

4) Looking into increase cross-chartering and management of third party vessels 

 

5) Evaluating market trends in relation to demand and supply dynamics for certain 

class and types of vessels which could be attractive from an earnings and yields 

perspective over the longer term as potential acquisitions

5.B. Material Topic #6: Internal Processes &amp; Procedures 

 

5.B.i. Material Sub-Topic #6.A: Age of Assets (Vessels) 

 

5.B.i.1. Current policies, practices and performance 

 

We market our vessels according to the specifications of the operators where an 

important specification for operators includes the age of vessels which has an impact on 

operational efficiencies. Both ADNOC and Saudi Aramco generally now require that 

vessels servicing their offshore fields be no more than 15 years old. Our MLS Division is 

a capital intensive industry, and the Atlantic Group’s ability to continue to meet the various 

demands and criteria of the NOCs requires a high internal program for maintenance, 

upkeep and also continuing investment and retrenchment of aging assets. Besides the 

requirements, this internal program is needed in order to meet NOCs requirements such as: 

 

• More environmentally friendly vessels 

• Technically advanced vessels 

• Vessels that are economical to run 

• Stringent industry standards for QHSE 

 

The Atlantic Group had, since its listing on the Catalist Board of the SGX-ST in 

2012, grown its fleet from 12 vessels to 22 vessels (including 2 owned under joint 

operations). We had over the last 2 years disposed of a couple of our old and low-value 

vessels with a view to lower the average age of our fleet and maintain a young and efficient 

fleet. 

 

After progressively taking delivery of 7 new vessels, the last 2 of which in October 

2018, the average age of the vessels in the fleet was 3.9 years estimated as at 31 March 

2019 excluding the 4 utility / supply / tug and barge vessels.

5.B.i.2. Future plans &amp; targets 

 

The Atlantic Group will continue to, both qualitatively and quantitatively, monitor 

its fleet to ensure that the vessels meet the evolving requirements of our key clients. While 

the Atlantic Group's fleet is young, the Atlantic Group has been and will continue to 

evaluate opportunities to improve the fleet operational efficiency which may include 

divesting of lower value and older vessels in its fleet.

5.B.ii. Material Sub-Topic #6.B: Processes, Systems, and Training 

 

5.B.ii.1. Current policies, practices, and performance 

 

Training 

 

Given that the UAE's population profile is about 80% expatriates, our staff, 

excluding crews, comes from about 10 countries with different cultures, educational 

backgrounds, training, and work experience. Therefore, training is crucial to ensure that 

our diverse workforce is equipped with the appropriate skills necessary to conduct their 

functions. 

 

A training plan is developed by the HR department each year, in collaboration with 

each head of department. Specifically, concerning the onshore staff, our HR is supportive 

in providing in-house training, such as QHSE and granting time-off for staff to attend 

relevant courses. With regards to offshore staff, training is provided in order to gain certain 

industry-specific certifications as per project requirements. 

 

Processes &amp; Systems 

 

One of our main operating entities, Atlantic Maritime Group FZE, has been 

established in the UAE for 17 years. While it had relied on fundamentally legacy (old) 

processes and systems, the Atlantic Group intends to be more efficient, effective and 

competitive to provide its stakeholders with reasons to be committed and to continue to 

invest in the Atlantic Group. 

 

The current operating procedures and practices are continually being reviewed in 

light of implementing a process-based risk-assessed quality control system. The process-

based risk analysis and assessment includes evaluation and measures to prevent failures in 

the different aspects of the company’s business activities, including: offshore marine 

operations, internal communications and information flow-exchange, changes in market 

dynamics, client evaluation, risks from clients, etc. 

 

The Atlantic Group will upgrade and optimize the current reporting and information 

management system to an advanced Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) solution.  

During FY2018, the off-shore crewing ERP had been undergoing testing and rolling out 

preparation which went live in operations in the first quarter of 2019. With regards to 

accounting back-office ERP (which is intended to interface among other operational 

divisions), we are currently shortlisting a few potential vendors.  

 

5.B.ii.2. Future plans &amp; targets 

 

The Atlantic Group plans to review, invest in (where necessary), and upgrade its 

processes and system, embrace new technologies, and conduct training so that its personnel 

can be more mobile, connected and able to react and respond to clients and operating 

demands in a timelier manner. 

 


 

57 

 



We are planning on working more closely with our staff to provide the necessary 

training required to develop their skills, both external and in house as required. 

Specifically, when the performance of the Atlantic Group improves, there are plans to 

allocate budget towards training our employees.

The above information consists primarily of data which are not easily tracked or 

available, or even if they are quantifiable, they may not be meaningful or applicable to our 

industry. The Atlantic Group will be reviewing and updating these KPIs for FY2019 and 

subsequent reports and provide updates if applicable or relevant.

5.C. Material Topic #5: Services to Clients 

 

5.C.1. Current policies, practices, and performance 

 

Changing NOC &amp; EPC Developments 

 

The Atlantic Group's fleet composition is currently concentrated in the anchor 

handling / towing / supply sector of the offshore activities, which has become saturated 

with vessels that result in low utilization and low charter rates. Current charter rates and 

utilization rates are not likely in general to support the capital investment of such vessels.  

 

The offshore dynamics are currently developing a demand for workboats and 

vessels with high crane specifications, as well as subsea support. Not responding to these 

market changes will isolate the fleet into a small, low-earning sector of the offshore 

operations. 

 

NOCs and EPC contractors have increasingly focused on cost reduction of 

operating costs, based on efficiency and optimization of their practices, as opposed to the 

just price reduction, which followed the initial market drop. The direct impacts of such 

practices are changes in the utilization per type of vessel and corresponding charter rates.  

 

Evolving Market Trends 

 

Coupled with the over-supply of offshore vessels in the market, this has prompted 

an analysis of the Company’s fleet earning potentials and the business operating model. 

The current fleet utilization is divided between long term contracts with Saudi Aramco, 

and spot market engagement with EPC contractors and offshore contracting companies. 

While the long term Saudi Aramco engagement is a low-risk recurring revenue stream, the 

spot market utilization is based mainly on the type of anchor-handling tug supply 

(“AHTS”) units.  

 

The AHTS market is currently on the lower earning potential in terms of charter 

rates and utilizations. The current market demand is inclined towards vessels related to 

various work and construction activities – including both subsea and top-side works. The 

market also demands vessels with more specialized operating specifications, such as large 

fuel capacity, shallow draft, accommodation, crane lifting capabilities, etc. 

 

The demand for lift-boats in the Middle East is expected to remain well-supported 

mainly due to ageing platforms and high spending on greenfield projects in KSA, UAE and 

Qatar. In general, markets in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa are less penetrated 

than the Gulf of Mexico or North Europe. Utilization levels of lifeboats are increasing with 

the potential to show improvements in the near term. With higher charter rates in 

comparison to AHTS, the lift boats are major contributors to the revenue generation of the 

Atlantic Group. The two lift-boats in the Atlantic Group’s fleet, i.e. AOS Maintainer I and 

Delta 22 are currently both on contracts with two different MENOCs.

5.C.2. Future plans &amp; targets 

 

We now operate from 2 offices in the UAE, which are those of Atlantic Maritime 

Group FZE and Atlantic Ship Management LLC. We are evaluating on expansion of our 

operations and offices in other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. This will allow 

us to increase our presence geographically, and to better meet the clients’ needs. 

 

To capitalize on the changing current market demands, the Atlantic Group intends 

to enhance on and diversify the fleet capability by expanding its service offerings in support 

of different aspects of offshore construction, subsea, survey and top-side operations and 

establish accesses to such vessels, either through suitable charters from other vessel 

owners, as well as enhancing the specifications of our own existing vessels. 

 

Enhancement of capacities for our own vessels, such as accommodation facilities, 

positioning services, and cargo capacities will allow the vessel to access not only the AHTS 

category, but also the work category which would result in improving utilization of the 

fleet, as well as allowing for the additional services to clients, and therefore, generating 

more revenue streams in addition to the charter rates.
