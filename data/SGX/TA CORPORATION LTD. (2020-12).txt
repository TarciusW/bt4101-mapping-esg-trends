Board Statement

The Board of Director is pleased to present TA 

Corporation Ltd (“TA Corp”) and its subsidiaries 

(“the Group”) fourth sustainability report. The 

Group is committed to incorporate long-term 

consideration 

of 

environment, 

social 

and 

governance (“ESG”) issues when formulating 

sustainable business practices that help to 

enhance long-term stakeholders’ value and provide 

reliable and sustainable products and services to 

our customers to create societal and environment 

benefits beyond our financial performance.

The Board provides strategic direction and in close 

interaction with the management monitors results 

of sustainability efforts undertaken by senior 

management of the Group.

The Board has emphasised that management 

will continue to be evaluated by its success in 

executing the Group’s strategic plan to meet 

stakeholders’ and the Board’s expectations, 

including responding to changing business and 

legal landscape while adhering to fundamental 

commitments. The Board is ultimately responsible 

for the Group’s compliance with the Code on 

sustainability reporting.

Senior management commitment and 

staff involvement

The Group continues to build on sustainability 

initiatives from past years, and improve on our past 

efforts in steering the course of our sustainability 

commitments.

The Group deploys a pragmatic approach to 

deliver our sustainability commitments. Our efforts 

are centred on putting in real world solutions with 

maximum benefits.

The Group maintains a strong focus on good 

corporate governance and risk management 

practices. We believe in upholding the highest 

ethical standards of corporate governance which 

translates into a sustainable and long-lasting 

overall sustainable performance.

The Group believes that sustainable supply 

chain management is core to our sustainability 

strategies. Hence, we extend our sustainable 

business practices across our value chain, from 

business units to suppliers. This includes applying 

environmentally friendly construction processes as 

well as using sustainable sources.

Senior management also affirms and dedicates 

communication platforms of different levels to 

interact with the various work groups and trades, 

each with its own function to address the ESG 

aspects and to enable continual improvement in 

the Group’s sustainability policies, processes and 

performance.

The emergence of COVID 19 has challenged the 

Group sustainability journey. At this juncture, the 

repercussion from COVID 19 is far from over, with 

conviction and fervour, it motivates us to embrace 

new normal in how we are going to conduct our 

business moving forward. We have since put 

priority and all necessary measure to ensure the 

safety and well-being of our personnel and to 

mitigate the economic fallout of this existential 

health threat, travel curbs, quarantines and 

lockdowns. This includes the implementation of 

business continuity plans, enhancement of online 

activities and austerity measures. In demonstrating 

of our solidarity to join the authorities’ efforts to 

contain the spread of the COVID 19, we fervently 

complied with the government’s measures for the 

construction sector as far as practical, our office 

also practices split team arrangement to work 

from home to comply with Ministry of Manpower 

(“MOM”) requirement for Safe Management 

Measures at workplace.

our sustainability approach

The Group’s sustainability approach is to integrate 

sustainability and manage our material ESG 

issues within our business strategies.

We recognise the increasing importance of ESG 

factors among our stakeholders and the business 

landscape we are operating in and we are aiming 

to align our sustainability initiatives within our 

business activities.

Our sustainability process begins with the 

identification of relevant ESG factors. Such factors 

are then prioritised and validated through our 

stakeholder engagement periodically. The result 

of this process determine the list of material ESG 

factors which are – Economic Performance; Energy 

Consumption; Emissions, Effluents and Waste 

as well as Occupational Health and Safety. The 

Board reviewed the identification, management 

and monitoring of the material sustainability topics 

in this Report.

This Report is to be read in conjunction with the 

Company’s financial statements in the Annual 

Report. This Report addresses the Group’s 

material ESG topics from 1 January 2020 to 

31 December 2020. All data is reported in good 

faith and to the best of our knowledge. This report 

is aligned with Singapore Exchange Securities 

Trading Limited (SGX-ST) Listing Rules 711A and 

711B – Sustainability Reporting Guide and has 

been prepared with reference to the internationally 

recognised Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 

Standards (2016).

The Board would like to thank all stakeholders 

who have contributed to our sustainability effort 

and will continue to take a balanced approach in 

enhancing long term values which are sustainable 

to our stakeholders.

Workplace safety

We are committed to preventing work-related 

injury or illness by implementing safety measures 

to address any safety and health risk present at the 

workplace. We conduct regular safety briefings to 

instil strong safety mind-set among our employees 

and subcontractors. We also conduct regular

measures awareness.

Workplace safety is a key business challenge and risk in our industry. Upholding good safety standards 

is paramount in protecting our employees from harm and boosting our stakeholders’ confidence in our 

organisation and we have implemented measures for the improvement of health and safety performance. 

These measures include requiring all new employees and any other personnel entering the sites for the 

first time, to attend a safety induction training as part of their orientation programme, and raising awareness 

through exhibitions and emergency drills.

To achieve the targets, we have in-housing training as follows:

To step up our readiness to manage emergencies, 

a team of our employees have been trained and 

are certified as first aiders for all our project sites. 

They are also trained to use automated external 

defibrillators (AED) and CPR techniques in case of 

a medical emergency.

As part of our continuous effort to promote a 

safe and healthy work environment, we have 

also launched work safety training and safety 

awareness courses conducted internally since 

FY2017.

We regularly share best safety practices in order 

to continuously improve on our safety standards. 

Recent accidents in the industry or near misses 

are periodically shared as learning points and to 

serve as reminder of the importance of safety at 

our workplace. To further reinforce the importance 

of workplace safety, we regularly conduct safety 

campaigns or actively participate in campaigns 

organised by our customers.

Through strict adherence to health and safety 

requirements, coupled with relevant programmes 

in place, we strive to remain vigilant to maintain 

stringent health and safety standards in all our 

business operations.

The Group has won multiple Occupational, Health 

and Safety certifications and corporate awards.

During the year, we serve and promote good 

practices to create a more positive safety culture 

in the construction industry. Safety culture is 

translated from the social and technical practices, 

attitudes, values, and priorities of management 

and employees. Together with that, it creates 

an impact on the development, implementation, 

performance, oversight, and enforcement of safety 

and health in the workplace.

COVID 19 safety measures

Beyond occupational health and safety, we also 

prioritised personal health and safety. Since news 

of COVID 19 first surfaced, we have actively sought 

to protect our personnel by equipping them with 

face masks and advised them to avoid crowded 

areas. We increased frequency of cleaning and 

disinfection of frequently touched surfaces and 

made hand sanitisers readily available even before 

official guidelines were issued by the authorities.

The onset of the global pandemic has placed 

health and safety in the workplace as a central 

concern for all our businesses. During the 

COVID 19 outbreak, we have taken cues directly 

from Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of 

Manpower’s (MOM) advisories and implemented 

various strict precautionary measures to reduce 

the spread of the virus at the workplace as well 

as address the safety and well-being of our staff.

In our effort to combat the COVID 19 pandemic, 

we 

have 

established 

Safe 

Management 

Measures (SMMs) which were communicated 

and strictly enforced among all employees to 

ensure that operations resume in a safe manner. 

Safe Management Officers (SMOs) have been 

appointed to conduct SMM inspection and checks 

to ensure compliance at all times. The SMM are 

applicable to all office staff and worksite workers.

In HQ, worksite offices and construction sites, 

we conduct twice-daily temperature checks and 

regular monitoring of health status. We also 

implemented safe entry measures at all entry and

exit points. We advise our employees to avoid 

overcrowding and implement staggered working 

hour and lunch time.

For our construction staff and workers, regular 

swab test are conducted. We comply to Building 

and Construction Authority (“BCA”) guidelines 

to reduce intermixing and avoid cross-infection 

of workers. For example, workers working on

the same project are cohorted in a dedicated 

accommodation, and work in segregated teams. 

At the dormitory and workers quarters, worker’s 

living space are increased and the shared facility 

are segregated. Additional toilet facilities are 

installed so that the workers only use the facilities 

assigned to them. Improvements are also made 

to the workers’ welfare and well-being, and to 

ensure safe distancing among workers during their 

transportation to the work site.

Due to an outbreak of COVID 19 among the 

foreign worker community in Singapore, workers 

residing at all foreign worker dormitories were 

placed under isolation or movement restrictions 

from 21 April 2020 as part of stricter Circuit 

Breaker measures, which required residents to 

stay within their dormitories at all times. Following 

the gradual easing of the Circuit Breaker measures 

from May 2020, necessary measures have been 

taken to ensure compliance with regulations order 

to allow workers residing there to resume work. 

The dormitory has been then declared COVID-

cleared and is working towards the fulfilment of 

requirements for work resumption.

During the period when the dormitories were 

in lockdown, the residents were kept engaged 

with various contactless activities and contests, 

including video making contest, cleanest unit 

contests and seasons greeting video contest. 

Cash vouchers and prizes were given out as prizes 

to winning participants.

employee engagement

We will continue to cultivate a transparent and 

inclusive environment to attract and retain talent 

while ensuring a top-down approach to promote 

fair and ethical business dealings.

Our employees are our key assets, and it is 

paramount that their safety, health and well-being 

are looked after. Staff engagement events such 

as Sports Day, annual Chines New Year lunch, 

Fruits day and tea sessions to create platform for 

our Management and Senior Staff to engage with 

employees and show appreciation for their hard 

work and contributions for the Group.

All full-time employees undergo an annual 

performance review. The Group adopts an open 

appraisal system where employees discuss and 

agree on their performance, areas for improvement, 

targets for the next cycle and personal and career 

development goals.

Employee morale is also vital to our business. In 

order to nurture high employee morale and greater 

camaraderie within our family, our HR department 

conducted TA Pulse survey annually to establish 

the morale index to measure the employees’ 

“happiness”.

Nonetheless, we noted there is drop in index in 

2020. We have investigated the root causes of 

the drop and shared with the respective head of 

department to identify the targeted areas to be 

improved on and building on its strength.

We show our appreciation towards our employees 

via a fair remuneration system and recognition 

programmes developed and established based 

on fair employment practices with the goal of 

attracting, developing and retaining a robust 

motivated workforce.

In anticipation of technological changes and 

its impact on the skillsets of its staff, the Group 

organised a series of sessions where professional 

trainers were invited to share insights on topics 

and trends related to its business, by organising 

these activities, the Group hopes to inculcate a 

spirit of lifelong learning and help equip staff with 

the knowhow to navigate a constantly changing 

world, to be job-ready in the future economy and 

employing digitalisation to improve work practices 

and increase productivity in the digital economy.

We have also organised regular Town Hall 

meeting by senior management with our working 

level employees to understand and identified their 

work issues and challenges especially during this 

ongoing pandemic crisis.

Learning and development

At TA Corporation, we believe in staff training and 

development to help them perform at their best 

and keep them motivated.

The Group encourages and supports the growth 

and development of its employees, advancing their 

knowledge and skills so that they stay responsive 

to changes in the work environment and can 

contribute optimally.

The Group had also set up a more structured 

approach to our training and explore the e-learning 

as a training platform that can be more accessible 

and wider reached as we operate in multiple 

geographical regions.

With increased reliance on digital capabilities as 

a business enabler, the Group restructured the 

learning and development contents and built in 

the SkillsFuture contents to equip the staff with 

the right skills and technical know-how to equip 

them to do their job more efficiently and effectively 

and overcoming technological challenges in 

the workplace. In addition, they learned how 

digitalisation can improve our work practices and 

increase productivity in the digital economy to help 

the growth of our business.

During the year, we have leveraged on the 

government training grants provided to Singapore-

based enterprises during this unprecedented 

COVID 19 pandemic to provide our employees 

with more training. Our employees enrolled in 

significantly more training courses in FY2020 as 

compared to FY2019. The courses range from 

technical skills required for the specific job scope, 

such as Safe Management Officer (SMO) course 

for construction, Occupational First Aid Course, 

Fire Safety Management and other skill including 

Skill Future for Digital Workplace and Digital 

Transformation.

Energy efficiency (energy and water conservation)

Environmental compliance forms an integral 

part of the Group’s sustainability philosophy. 

As a diversified business group with operations 

spanning across real estate, construction, 

distribution and training, it increased pressure 

on us to be accountable for the environmental 

footprint and rising cost of natural resources, we 

endeavour to not just comply but also integrate 

the best sustainability practices across business 

operations to reduce adverse environmental 

impact on the ecosystem.



To promote environmental sustainability, our 

Group has embarked on a series of environmental 

sustainability efforts using a multi-pronged 

approach. We have implemented an environmental 

management system to identify and manage the 

environmental aspects of our operations, including 

the usage and conservation of energy and water, 

as well as the usage of paper. We manage our 

environmental footprint further by establishing 

reduction targets and implementing programs 

to achieve these targets. Our efforts to promote 

environmental protection have won us recognition 

such as the receipt of a Green &amp; Gracious Builder 

(Excellent) certificate.

At our construction sites, the Group has 

implemented 

various 

energy 

conservation 

measures such as installing energy-efficient 

motion-sensing lighting and light sensors at site 

offices and toilets and green walls to lower room 

temperature to reduce electricity consumption. 

Furthermore, we ensure that air-conditioning 

systems for our projects under construction and 

our corporate offices in Singapore are also energy 

efficient, giving preference to equipment with the 

Energy Star logo.

In terms of conserving water, our Group has also 

implemented water conservation measures such 

as the use of recycled water for general cleaning 

purpose and at washing bays as well as installed 

water-saving devices such as self-closing taps and 

water thimbles in our project sites and corporate 

offices in Singapore where possible.

We continuously monitor our energy and water 

consumption to ensure that there is no abnormal 

spike and will continue to identify areas of 

improvement to improve resource efficiency to 

contribute to environmental sustainability.

Promoting green practices

Our Group is committed to being a progressive 

builder in addressing environmental and public 

concerns arising from construction works. We 

firmly support efforts to promote sustainability, 

environmental 

protection 

and 

considerate 

practices by builders during the construction phase 

of development.

To reduce our environmental footprint, we leverage 

on environmentally-friendly technologies and 

practices to ensure that we lessen our operations’ 

impact on the environment. Our Go Green efforts 

include:

(i) 

Extensive usage of recycled aggregates for 

non-structural applications like drains, road, 

kerbs and wheel stoppers;

(ii) 

Use of energy-efficient equipment, green 

label photocopiers, 4 ticks air-conditioners 

and creeper plant in the site office (green 

walls);

(iii) 

Use of green label materials such as 

playground flooring and equipment, paint, 

tile 

adhesive, 

waterproof 

membrane, 

drywall, carpet, vinyl flooring, ceiling board, 

joint grout, etc.;

(iv) 

Providing covered walkways around the site 

where there is heavy usage by the public;

(v) 

Use of cast metal formwork to reduce the 

usage of timbers;

(vi) 

Use of pre-fabricated, pre-casted and 

Prefabricated 

Bathroom 

Unit 

(PBU), 

construction elements to reduce wastage of 

construction materials;

(vii) Use of solar panels hoarding lights;

(viii) Use of drones to check the peripheral drain 

and the depression to prevent environmental 

impacts to the neighbour;

(ix) 

Use of e-PTW (Permit To Work) app to 

reduce usages of papers; and

(x) 

e-Competency Test for workplace safety 

and health (“WSH”) to reduce usages of 

papers;

As a proponent of the Green and Gracious Builder 

Scheme (“GGBS”) initiated by BCA. We inculcate 

the 

environmental 

consciousness, 

promote 

environmental protection and gracious practices 

during the construction and building process. The 

adoption of the GGBS by the Group has raised 

the level of environmental consciousness among 

the project team and also helps to align all entities 

within the Group towards the discharge of our 

environmental responsibilities.

Our good green practices include the following but 

not limited to

• 

Control resources utilization and minimize 

waste/pollutants generation

• 

Create greater awareness of environmental 

issues through training and communication

• 

Monitor 

environmental 

performance 

periodically

• 

Good housekeeping procedures and a well 

maintained site

Good gracious practices include:

• 

To provide public with a safe environment

• 

To prevent noise and vibration generated on 

the site

• 

To ensures pro-active communication to the 

community

Emission control, effluent and waste management

As we grow our business, we are committed to 

reduce the environmental impacts of our business 

activities. Similar to previous years, we have 

complied accordingly to the laws and regulations in 

FY2020 and achieved our target. Moving forward, 

we aim to ensure continual compliance with the 

relevant laws and regulations.

Managing this impact allows the Group to align 

with national priorities, mitigate policy and physical 

risks and reduce operational costs.

The Group aims to minimise the environmental 

impacts created by its operations. To manage the 

Group’s environmental performance holistically 

and systematically, the Group has acquired ISO 

14001 

Environmental 

Management 

System 

certification for its Construction business unit. 

Going forward, the Group will continue to maintain 

zero non-conformances for all external audits 

conducted for the aforementioned management 

systems.

Our Group’s operation in Singapore conforms to all 

local environment laws and regulations including 

the emission target set by the authority.

The Group has also adopted various measures to 

optimise its utilities and emissions performance, 

including regular maintenance of equipment and 

facilities to maintain optimal energy efficiency, 

provision of high-efficiency systems such as lifts 

with variable voltage frequency drive and sleep 

mode features, and installation of energy-efficient 

light fittings and motion sensors at the common 

staircases and toilets.

Due to the nature of our business, our activities 

and operation also create noise and vibration by 

tools and machines use on sites. In this regard, we 

are committed to implementing practical pollution 

and noise control measures in line with the NEA 

regulation and industry standard in order to ensure 

parameter of noise emission is under control.

We continue to attain both Green &amp; Gracious 

Builders Scheme certificate and ISO 14001 and 

ISO 9001 for our continuing efforts in these areas.

Vector control

The construction industry plays an important role 

to play a part to curb dengue transmission and 

protect our workers and residents around work 

sites against dengue disease. This is even more 

important during the circuit breaker period, vector 

control plans are currently implemented at every 

project site to prevent mosquito breeding to protect 

the construction site personnel and members of 

the public from mosquito-borne diseases.

We will continue to make assurance that all of 

our construction site workers are well-educated 

and well-aware of the harmful effects of mosquito 

breeding. We will also continue to cultivate good 

practices, conduct routine checks and engage pest 

control companies to carry out regular insecticide 

spraying to prevent any possible breeding of 

vectors.

As we grow our business, we are committed to 

reduce the environmental impacts of our business 

activities. Similar to prior year, we have complied to 

the laws and regulations in FY2020 and achieved 

our target. Moving forward, we aim to ensure 

continual compliance with the relevant laws and 

regulations.
