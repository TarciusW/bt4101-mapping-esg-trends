OUR LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS

OUR LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS 

Dear Stakeholders,  

Ever since the establishment of ES 

Group 

(Holdings) Limited and 

its 

subsidiaries in 1975, our vision and 

mission that have been instilled in us for 

over 40 years have brought us far, and 

even through tough times like previous 

downturns in the offshore and marine 

industry.  

We seek to deliver steady value growth 

in our new building and repair segment, 

as well as our shipping segment through 

innovative supply chain solutions and 

sustainable 

long-term 

partnerships. 

Together with our management, our 

Board has determined the material 

environmental, social and governance 

(“ESG”) risks as well as the opportunities 

that are important steps to our Group’s 

long-term success.  

Our Board has been providing ongoing 

oversight on a range of initiatives 

relating 

to 

enterprise-wide 

safety, 

protecting 

the 

environment, 

compliance, 

creating 

equal 

opportunities for all employees and 

giving back to the community. To ensure 

effective implementation, our Board is 

working closely with our management 

to monitor the progress of all initiatives 

targeted at these factors. This enables 

our Board to respond to changing 

market developments while keeping in 

view our stakeholders’ inputs and 

expectations. 

Our core business in the new building 

and repair segment remains a significant 

aspect of our Group’s operations and 

the focus on safety and performance of 

our workers continues to be of 

paramount importance for 2019. We 

remain committed to safety and training 

for our workers and we strive for a “Zero 

Accident” goal in the shipyards.   

Our shipping segment continues to be a 

significant segment for reporting as it 

contributed to 22.8% of our Group’s 

revenue in 2019. Being part of the 

shipping industry, our Group is aware of 

the carbon emission damage and hopes 

that ongoing efforts in reducing carbon 

footprint will contribute towards the 

industry’s significant client action efforts 

given that over 90% of all global trades 

are carried out by ships.  

As the world moves towards a lower 

emission 

future, 

our 

Group 

fully 

supports the decision of International 

Maritime 

Organisation 

(IMO) 

to 

implement a 0.5% sulphur cap (down 

from 3.5%) for marine fuels in an effort 

to reduce the amount of sulphur oxide, 

from 1 January 2020 (“IMO 2020”). In 

view of this, our Group has switched 

from using heavy marine fuel oil to low 

sulphur fuel oil in November 2019 for 

our vessel, ES Aspire, to be in 

compliance with IMO 2020 as we 

strongly believe in “cleaner shipping for 

cleaner air”.   

Our 

Group 

has 

been 

publishing 

sustainability reports for the third year 

now, since our inaugural sustainability 

report for 2017, which was published in 

November 

2018. 

We 

have taken 

feedbacks on our past reports on board 

and this edition adopts a more 

structured and detailed explanation of 

our sustainability policies and efforts. 

Understanding that sustainability is a 

long-term voyage, we believe in the 

continuous collaboration with each of 

our stakeholders to ultimately create a 

more sustainable operation in every 

aspect of our Group. We hope that this 

report will communicate our efforts to a 

broader audience as well as spur us to 

build an enduring and high performing 

business. 

Join us in our Voyage into Sustainability.

On Behalf of the Board of Directors

OUR STAKEHOLDERS 

Stakeholders 

of 

the 

Company 

(“Stakeholders”) referred in this report 

are various groups of people who uses 

this report, alongside with the Annual 

Report published separately, to garner 

information on our sustainability efforts 

and the relevant risks, impacts, and 

opportunities arising from the relevant 

sustainability elements. Stakeholders 

include our shareholders, customers, 

suppliers, employees and government, 

as detailed below.

We reach out to the Stakeholders by 

means of published documents on our 

website and on the Singapore Exchange 

(“SGX”) website.  

Stakeholders working within the Group 

correspond with us via whistle-blowing 

procedures or through their respective 

reporting lines, whereas Stakeholders 

outside the Group correspond with us 

via our contact details listed in our 

website or under the section “Our 

Reporting Basis” of this report.

The Group does not have an active 

engagement approach such as surveys 

and discussions group, as the Group is 

still in the process of maturing its 

Sustainability Report and its topics and 

factors (refer to the section “Our 

Sustainability Topics” of this report) 

before we are able to have a meaningful 

and fruitful engagement with our 

Stakeholders.

Shareholders 



As the provider of capital and owners of the Group, Shareholders play an important role in the control, financing, and 

governance of the Group’s business. Shareholders are concerned with the going concern of the Group and the 

maximisation of returns on the capital they have invested. The Group’s commitment to a sustainable operation is their 

utmost interest as we continue to strive for excellence in alignment of their interest.

Customers



In line with the Group’s Vision and Missions, we believe in customers’ satisfaction and excellence in quality, and they in 

return will be concerned with our sustainability towards upholding, or perhaps exceed, their expectation on the quality of 

our services and products. 

Suppliers



Strong and effective relationships with our suppliers give our business better strategic advantages, which includes access 

to resources, greater supplier support, and lower costs. Suppliers will be interested in our financial performance in terms 

of payment ability so as to decide on the continuance of our working relationship in the long run. 

Employees 



As a labour-intensive operation with a huge labour force, the Group focuses on human resource related policies (e.g. merit-

based and non-discriminatory recruitment; grievance procedures) and the safety of our employees, which are crucial 

factors for attracting and retaining the best employees, and employees’ motivation and commitment to the Company. 

Government



The relevant statutory boards of the Government will be interested in how we have imposed relevant internal controls and 

processes to ensure that all applicable laws and regulations have been adhered to.

OUR COMMITMENT TO A SUSTAINABLE OPERATION 

For the past 40 over years, we have 

been a quality driven service provider in 

the offshore and marine industry 

committed to uphold high level of 

customers’ satisfaction. Along the 

journey, we have recognised that the 

Group’s activities have a broad impact 

on the social, environmental, and 

financial aspects within the Group and 

outside the Group. Hence, we are 

committed 

to 

work 

with 

the 

Stakeholders 

to 

address 

all 

sustainability concerns – minimising the 

unfavourable 

impact 

and 

taking 

advantage 

of 

the 

favourable 

opportunities – with our vision and 

mission in the heart of our operation 

and not deviating from that.  

Voyaging into Sustainability 

We 

have 

published 

our 

first 

Sustainability Report (for the financial 

year ended 31 December 2017) in 

November 

2018, 

driven 

by 

the 

requirement of SGX Catalist Rules, 

which marks our first embarkation to 

the road of sustainability. 

In 2020, our third publication (for the 

financial year ended 31 December 

2019) remains on on-going voyage into 

sustainability reporting, with key 

efforts to improve the quality of the 

report in terms of compliance (refer to 

the section “Our Reporting Basis” of 

this report for more information), 

depth, 

relevance, 

and 

understandability.  

We believe that the driver for 

sustainability must first start from a 

sound 

and 

effective 

Corporate 

Governance that propagates across 

each function of our Group, which we 

will detail further below.

Management Approach 

The Group believes that it is important 

to establish good corporate governance 

within the Group as this provides the 

foundation for a well-managed and 

efficient organisation. This can in turn 

sustain good business performance and 

safeguard 

the 

interests 

of 

the 

Stakeholders. The Board of Directors of 

the Company (the “Board” or the 

“Directors”) is committed to continually 

develop and uphold high standards of 

corporate governance, guided by the 

principles 

and 

guidelines 

of 

the 

Singapore 

Code 

of 

Corporate 

Governance 2018 (the “Code”) issued 

by 

the 

Monetary 

Authority 

of 

Singapore. A full detailed Corporate 

Governance Report can be found in the 

Annual Report 2019 pages 14 to 37. 

Whistle-Blowing 

Whistle-blowing policies have been in 

place 

since 

2010. 

The 

Group 

encourages employees to report in 

good faith and in confidence, without 

fear of reprisals, concerns about 

possible 

improprieties 

in 

financial 

reporting or other matters to the 

chairman of the Audit and Risk 

Committee. 

Reportable 

conducts 

include, but are not limited to, fraud, 

corruption, illegality, safety violations, 

and 

serious 

misconduct 

that 

contravene the procedures set by the 

Group that may lead to losses for the 

Group. Losses can include financial 

losses, non-financial losses, and tarnish 

of reputation of the Group.  

Whistle-blowing policy and whistle-

blowing reports received (if any), will be 

assessed by the Audit and Risk 

Committee from time to time. 

No incident of reportable conducts 

occurred during the financial year 

ended 31 December 2019. We aspire to 

maintain this record for the next 

financial year.

Sustainability Management 

Sustainability matters are managed by 

the 

Compliance 

Committee 

(“Committee”). The Committee, was 

first set up in 2010 to implement and 

review 

the 

effectiveness 

of 

the 

compliance framework of the Group 

with the SGX Catalist Rules, compliance 

with 

legislation 

and 

regulations 

imposed by the relevant authorities, as 

well as the liaison with professional 

advisors on all corporate documents 

and actions (e.g. announcements, 

circulars, etc.). 

The Committee also spearheads and 

manages all sustainability management 

matters, align with the requirements 

imposed by the SGX Catalist Rules, 

which includes: 

 Setting the direction of the Group’s 

sustainability efforts. 

 Identifying 

and 

reviewing 

the 

sustainability factors. 

 Reporting the identified factors to the 

Board at least once annually. 

 Reporting identified factors to all 

Stakeholders 

via 

the 

published 

sustainability report. 

The Committee reports to the Audit and 

Risk Committee.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS

OUR SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS 

Our Assessment Processes 

Sustainability topics primarily revolve 

around the operational aspects of our 

businesses, and are inherent factors 

arising from within the Group. They are 

deemed material to either impact our 

businesses if these factors are poorly 

managed or will have a direct impact on 

our Stakeholders in their decision-

making processes, or on the economic, 

environmental, and social factors of 

using our products and services.  

Other factors include external factors 

outside the Group (such as political 

development internationally or locally, 

socio-economic factors, environmental 

issues, and so on) where these factors 

will have material impact over the 

Group’s 

operational 

performance, 

economically or socially. 

As introduced in the section “Our 

Corporate Profile” in this report, our 

operations are separated into two main 

segments. 

In 

the 

application 

of 

materiality for the identification of 

material sustainable topics, we looked 

into these two main segments and their 

presence in the various geographical 

locations where the operations of the 

respective segments are. We further 

identify whether the operations are 

significant to focus in the scope of our 

reporting. 

We then proceed to identify the 

material Sustainability Topics at a 

broad level, as presented in the 

Material Topic Matrix (see Table 2). 

The accompanying risks, impacts and 

opportunities 

factors 

under 

each 

Sustainability 

Topic 

(“Sustainability 

Factors”) 

are 

then 

assigned 

and 

presented in the following Identified 

Sustainability Factors Table (see Table 

3). 

Most of our Sustainability Topics 

revolve around the new building and 

repair segment as it is the core business 

of the Group. The Group continuously 

assess, based on events occurring both 

internally and externally, information 

and 

feedbacks 

received 

from 

Stakeholders, 

the 

relevance 

and 

materiality of each Sustainability Topic 

and Factors and shall report based on 

the 

latest 

relevant

Management approach

Our core business is a manpower-centric operation, and this reflects the 

importance in maintaining a healthy workforce and a safe working environment. 

High accident rate in the shipyard will reflect a risky work environment that will 

impair the morale and the confidence of the workers towards the Group. It will 

also expose the Group to potential litigation as well as fines from authorities. 

We are devoted in maintaining a healthy workforce and a safe working 

environment through the efforts detailed below, and further testified and audited 

with the attainment of OHSAS 18001:2007, SS 506: Part 1: 2009, and BizSAFE Star. 

HEALTH AND SAFETY OF 

WORKERS 

Accidents are unforeseeable events and 

may 

not 

be 

entirely 

avoidable. 

Nonetheless the Group aims to achieve 

a ‘Zero Accident’ goal with adopted 

measures such as educating workers 

and implementing accident preventive 

procedures. Further initiatives include 

inculcating a ‘Safety First’ mindset to all 

workers on the ground as well as having 

an adequate number of safety officers 

on board vessels to supervise and 

ensure safety regulations are followed 

by workers. 

Safety starts from every individual, and 

that is where inculcating a ‘Safety First’ 

mindset is the utmost importance in 

achieving a ‘Zero Accident’ goal. This is 

done by emphasising safety matters 

during daily and weekly site briefings, 

putting up safety information posters 

around the site as well as implementing 

punitive system to penalise workers 

who 

knowingly 

breach 

safety 

regulations. During lunch time, workers 

are allowed to take a nap to recharge 

and remain alert for the remaining of 

the day. 

To further encourage individuals to be 

responsible for the safety of their own 

and people around them, the Group 

awards top performers during our 

annual Safety Award Presentation to 

recognise the efforts put in by 

individuals. Each worker is appraised 

individually 

by 

the 

Department 

Manager 

based 

on 

his 

safety 

knowledge, 

number 

of 

safety 

infringements, number of accidents 

and incidents, proficiency in material 

handling, and so on. Top performing 

workers 

are 

then 

selected 

and 

awarded a Certificate of Recognition 

for the outstanding performance in 

Workplace Safety and Health for the 

year.  

Another level of safeguard over safety 

is by stationing safety officers on board 

vessels to supervise and ensure safety 

regulations are followed by workers. 

Supervisors working on board will 

provide an additional pair of eyes on 

safety. The Group ensures both the 

safety officers and supervisors are 

adequately trained and updated by 

sending them to courses (e.g. Shipyard 

safety induction course). 

Our commitment to achieve a ‘Zero 

Accident’ goal is further demonstrated 

with 

the achievement 

of 

safety 

certification OHSAS 18001:2007, SS 

506: Part 1: 2009 and BizSafe Star. 

Annual audit is required to ensure that 

safety procedures are intact and 

followed before certifications can be 

renewed.

Safe Working Environment 

Injury statistics as seen in Tables 4 to 6 

are data tabulated from the new 

building and repair segment in the 

shipyard in Singapore for the Group, 

and consists wholly of our own male 

employees 

(females 

non-executive 

holds administrative roles in the offices 

– refer to the section “Employment 

Practices 

– 

Diversification 

of 

Workforce” in this report for more 

information) in the shipyard. No third 

parties’ workers are engaged. 

The categories of injury are defined 

below: 

 First Aid Injury (FAI): Incidents that 

require first aid treatment and are 

considered minor. The worker will 

be able to work as per normal. 

 Non-lost Time Injury (NLTI): Injury 

that are moderately light but 

require more medical attention as 

compared to FAI. According to 

doctor’s 

instructions 

/ 

recommendations, the worker will 

still be able to work on the day of 

incident, but on work that are 

deemed to be light duty and will not 

aggravate his injury further. 

 Lost Time Injury (LTI): Any work-

related injury or illness which 

prevents an employee from doing 

any work after an incident and / or 

being hospitalised, but is not within 

the scope of Lost Time Accident 

below. 

 Lost 

Time 

Accident 

(LTA):

A 

recordable incident whereby an 

employee is not able to return to 

work or is assigned restricted work 

on the day following the incident 

and / or hospitalised. ‘Recordable’ is 

determined by a medical leave of 

more than 3 days, or hospitalisation 

for more than 24 hours. 

The Group has seen a decrease in the 

Incident Frequency Rate from 29 cases 

per million man-hours in 2018, to 6 

cases per million man-hours in 2019. 

This was mainly due to the decrease in 

number of cases of all kind of injuries 

namely FAI, NLTI, LTI and LTA. The 

decrease in LTA has also translated to a 

lower Incident Severity Rate of 27 man-

days lost per million man-hours in 2019, 

from 84 man-days lost per million man-

hours in 2018. The number of LTA cases 

decreased from 5 cases in 2018, to 1 

case in 2019. 

The Group continues to strive towards 

‘Zero Accident’ goal and targets to cap 

the number of LTA, IFR, ISR and ODR 

cases in 2020 at zero per million man-

hours and zero man-days lost per 

million man-hours. 

All safety accidents must be reported to 

the safety officer. In an event of a 

workplace injury, the worker is required 

to report directly to the immediate 

supervisor on the incident or accident. 

The supervisor will then immediately 

report to the safety officer with details 

on how the incident or accident 

occurred, the exact time and location, 

and the injury sustained by the worker 

during the incident or accident.

For prompt medical attention, workers 

are 

directed 

to 

nearby 

general 

practising medical clinics and private 

hospitals, in addition to government 

hospitals. In compliance to the local 

foreign worker legislation, workers are 

covered with the necessary insurance 

policies.

Safe Living and Working Environment 

Majority of our workers in the shipyard 

stays in the dormitory, which includes  

rented dormitory (approved by Ministry 

of Manpower) as well as our own 

dormitory. For rented dormitory, rules 

and regulations are imposed by the 

landlord to ensure that the dormitory is 

kept in healthy and liveable conditions. 

The 

onus 

of 

the 

creation 

and 

maintenance of a healthy and safe living 

environment for our own dormitory lies 

on our hand.  

We have imposed rules and regulations 

to all living in our dormitory and ensure 

that all workers abide by them to 

maintain a healthy and safe living 

environment. Serious offences such as 

display of violence, indecent behaviour, 

gambling, shoplifting, drug abuse and 

money lending activity shall result in 

eviction of the workers from the 

dormitory. Other offences, such as 

smoking 

at 

undesignated 

area, 

indiscriminate parking of bicycles, 

failure to hang clothes on assigned 

racks, failure to tidy personal area and 

improper disposal of rubbish, attract 

fines. Spot checks by supervisors and 

human resource staff are conducted at 

random so as to ensure that rules and 

regulations are adhered to, where 

punitive measures are imposed against 

workers in breach of the rules. 

We have also, in line with Building and 

Construction Authority’s rules and 

regulations, Ministry of Manpower 

Occupational Safety and Health (“OSH”) 

regulations 

as 

well 

as 

OHSAS 

18001:2007, 

implemented 

an 

Operational Control Procedure (“OCP”). 

The OCP detailed the following: 

 Responsibility 

to 

the 

relevant 

parties in the Emergency Response 

Team (“ERT”). 

 Identification, 

assessment, 

and 

prevention of OSH Emergencies 

Risks. 

 Emergency response protocol in the 

event of an emergency. 

 Site 

clean-up 

and 

follow-up 

protocol. 

The OCP is applicable to the workshop, 

office and dormitory (all situated at the 

same location at 10 Kwong Min Road) 

owned by the Group, in which it is 

extended to all personnel working at 

the workshop and office, a tenant 

renting partial of the workshop space, 

and workers staying in the dormitory. 

The effectiveness of the emergency 

response protocol is assessed every 

year 

by 

carrying 

out 

Emergency 

Evacuation Drill (the “Drill”). The Drill 

for financial year ended 31 December 

2019 was conducted efficiently and 

successfully in accordance to the OCP, 

where all company personnel and 

tenants were accounted for at the 

muster point within 17 minutes from 

the start of the Drill. 

Global warming and safety  

Global warming has been affecting the 

whole world where extreme changes to 

the weather can be observed around 

the globe. 

In Singapore, we are observing higher 

temperatures 

and 

intense 

heat, 

accompanied by erratic storms. This 

expose our workers in our core business 

working in shipyards on board vessels 

to higher risk of heat injury and 

lightning risks arising from erratic 

thunderstorm. 

Safety officers are tasked to ensure that 

the workers, including themselves are 

protected 

against 

such 

weathers. 

Workers exposed to intense heat are 

given frequent breaks to properly 

hydrate and cool themselves to prevent 

heat injury, and in the case of wet 

weather workers on board will be 

evacuated 

from 

open 

space 

to 

sheltered areas.

Sustainability Factors identified in 

earlier year remain valid 

 Update information for 

Sustainability Factors 

Continue to assess the validity of the 

Sustainability Factors and the 

information contained therein. 

Management Approach 

As our core business function relies heavily on manpower, labour practices in managing both employees’ welfare and 

development, labour supply and costs affected by macro-factors such as inter-country relationship, and fair and equal 

employment practices have a direct impact on the sustainability of our operation, in terms of the costs of our operations and 

the employees’ job fulfilment. The Group aims to create a working culture that is fair, equal, inclusive, diverse, and free from 

any form of discrimination.  

EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES 

The first step to achieving the ideal work 

culture is to have a sound system of 

employment policy. Such policy includes 

care of the responsible hiring and fair 

compensation commensurate with non-

bias and commonly accepted indicators 

and rights of employees. 

Work-life balance 

The Group understands the importance 

for our employees to strike a balance 

between their work commitment and 

their personal life. We provide a certain 

degree of flexibility by supporting their 

need to apply urgent leave to take care 

of their personal matters, particularly to 

family related matters, or pre-approved 

tweak in their work schedule to enable 

them to pick their children or go for 

night classes for skill upgrade courses. 

The 

Group 

also 

adheres 

to 

the 

applicable employment legislation to 

provide 

paternal, 

maternal 

and 

childcare leave for employees to take 

care of their children as and when 

required. 

Fair compensation and benefits 

The Group commits to compensating 

our employees fairly and commensurate 

with 

employees’ 

position 

and 

experience, 

free 

from 

any 

discrimination. 

Employee’s 

compensation in Singapore is not 

subjected 

to 

minimum 

wages. 

Employees are also given benefits and 

compensation 

for 

overtime 

work 

prescribed 

by 

the 

applicable 

employment law and regulations. 

Rights of employees 

The Group does not currently have any 

policy to either advocate or restrict 

rights of our employees to associate 

freely, engage in collective bargaining, 

participate in trade / labour union, as 

well as seek representation as long as it 

is permitted by the governing law and 

regulations. There is no collective 

bargaining agreement for employees in 

the Group. 

In any event of significant operational 

changes that affects an employee, the 

employee will be notified at least one 

month in advance for them to have the 

necessary preparation. 

Ethical and responsible hiring 

The 

Group 

practises 

ethical 

and 

responsible hiring. We do not practice 

nor accept any hiring of any persons that 

are either below the prescribed legal 

working 

age 

by 

the 

governing 

employment law and regulation of the 

country our operations are present 

(known subsequently as “child labour”) 

and the hiring of persons that are 

unwilling, forced, bonded, or other 

forms of compulsory forced labour that 

goes against the will and the natural 

course of the accepted norm of an 

employment process. 

In Singapore, employments, where 

applicable, 

are 

approved 

and/or 

submitted 

to 

the 

respective 

Government authorities overlooking 

labour 

matters. 

This 

ensure 

that 

employees are of legal age and 

protected 

by 

the 

employment 

legislation which forbids child, forced 

and compulsory labour. 

We ensure that our suppliers do their 

part in respect to their employees’ rights 

and practice ethical and responsible 

hiring through efforts detailed in Supply 

Chain Management. 

The Group has not been subjected to 

human rights review or human rights 

impact assessment in all geographical 

locations our operations are in. 

DIVERSIFICATION OF 

WORKFORCE 

An inclusive and diverse working culture 

requires an employment policy that 

accepts people of all backgrounds and 

not based on prejudicial selection.  

The Group understands the importance 

and benefits of having a diversified 

workforce, which includes: 

• Macro-factor relating to labour 

policy and relationship between 

Singapore and other countries, 

affecting supply of labour and the 

associated 

cost.

prevent the over-reliance on one or 

two nationality group(s) and mitigate 

the impact on unfavourable labour 

change 

in 

labour 

policy 

and 

relationship on the said countries. 

• Socio-factor where workers learn 

how to interact, work and live with 

people of different ethnic groups 

and nationalities while working, 

and also adapting to the society 

outside work. This enable workers 

to be able to adapt and live in a 

cosmopolitan 

nation 

like 

Singapore. 

• People from different location, 

coming from different culture, can 

propagate different positive work 

habits and input creative solutions 

to tackle challenges. 

• Reduce the chance of possible 

strikes and bullying due to over-

powering 

of 

one 

particular 

nationality, ethnic or religious 

group. 

It is the Group’s policy to be open in the 

recruitment of persons of different 

background (e.g. gender, nationality, 

age and so on) for all positions 

(including office positions).  

Our challenges in diversification of 

workers 

lies 

on 

the 

gender 

diversification, where the bulk of our 

workforce in the core business is 

dominated by men. This is due to the 

nature of work in the shipyard 

demanding 

physical 

strength 

and 

exposure to the hot sun as well as the 

already male-dominated environment 

that female would normally refrain 

themselves from applying. 

All employees are permanent and full-

time staff during the years 2019 and 

2018.

Please refer to Tables 7 to 10 for the 

information on the diversity of our 

workforce.

CAREER DEVELOPMENT 

Attracting and retaining talents is an 

important step in achieving the ideal 

work culture.  

Furthermore, our reliance on skilled 

personnel (such as heavy equipment 

operators, 

draughtsmen, 

welders, 

grinders, etc) is unavoidable. Skilled 

personnel 

with 

the 

appropriate 

experiences 

and/or 

requisite 

certifications in our industry are limited 

and competition for such personnel is 

intense. Hence, there is a need to 

continue to retain the skilled personnel 

that we have trained.  

Therefore, 

we 

believe 

in 

the 

development of our workers and this is 

in line with our mission. We send our 

employees for training not just for 

single trade but multiple trades so that 

workers can be re-deployed whenever 

reshuffling of workforce is required.  

This give them a sense of job 

satisfaction, personal development and 

enhance job security and employability 

of each employee, which we hope will 

inspire greater intrinsic value within 

themselves. 

This policy also enables us to be less 

reliance on the external labour market, 

improve efficiency and quality in the 

work produced by the workers, as well 

as give workers the opportunity to 

develop and excel within the Group. 

Furthermore, 

all 

employees 

are 

subjected to performance review, 

regardless of employment category or 

gender and without prejudice. These 

performance reviews are conducted on 

an annual basis where employees’ 

performance during the year are 

assessed. Through these appraisals, 

management can identify areas for 

development of each employee’s skill 

set. 

New hire and turnover of employees 

Despite the efforts stated above to 

retain our skilled workers, the Group 

practices lean cost management (since 

2015) by managing and restructuring 

our headcount to align with the 

demand in the marine, oil and gas 

industries. The employee turnover and 

hire rates are expected to stabilise as 

the market stabilise. Please refer to 

Tables 11 to 12 for the data on new hire 

and turnover of employees. 

Our turnover rate has decreased from 

23.3% in 2018 to 16.0% in 2019. 

However, the hire rate has increased 

from 2.0% in 2018 to 21.5% in 2019 

(refer to Table 13). The Group increased 

its hire rate (notwithstanding a decline 

in turnover rate) to meet the demands 

as a result of an increase in business 

activities. 

Training 

We have not presented training for 

other employment categories as those 

are cyclical in nature and immaterial 

(15% of the Group’s workforce). 

Training provided to non-executives are 

only to all male non-executives due to 

the circumstances that all female non-

executives holds administrative office 

roles. 

Training hours per employee per year 

has decreased from 14 hours per 

employee in 2018 to 7 hours per 

employee in 2019. This was due to 

majority of the core training for the 

workers being completed in 2017 and 

2016 and these trained workers are still 

with the Group. 

LABOUR POLICY AND 

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 

SINGAPORE AND OTHER 

COUNTRIES AND ITS RELEVANT 

LAWS AND REGULATIONS 

A clear understanding of the applicable 

labour laws and regulations, as well as 

the labour policy and relationship 

between Singapore and other countries 

are required given that our shipyard 

business relies largely on foreign 

workers (including skilled workers) 

from Thailand, Bangladesh, China, 

India, Malaysia and Myanmar to meet 

our staffing needs.  

Our labour supply and its associated 

costs are correlated to developments of 

labour policies of the abovementioned 

countries as well as the relationship 

between them and Singapore. In 

addition to the above, we are also 

subjected 

by 

local 

employment 

legislation, in terms of hiring quota, 

levies 

and 

security 

bonds. 

Any 

unfavourable changes to either of the 

above 

will 

definitely 

affect 

our 

operations.  

We stay constantly updated to the 

labour policies between Singapore and 

other countries, and to the local 

legislation (largely in particular to the 

Singapore Budget), so as to react and 

tweak, at the earliest possible, our 

employment practices accordingly to 

minimise 

and 

mitigate 

any 

unfavourable impact.

OUR ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY 

Management Approach 

The going-concern and profitability of 

the Company is without a doubt the 

highest 

concern 

for 

Stakeholders. 

Financially 

sound 

strategy 

and 

operational method for the present and 

the future determine the profitability 

and sustainability of the Group. The 

accurate and transparent presentation 

of financial information in the financial 

statements will provide transparency of 

the performance and position of the 

Group for Stakeholders. 

We constantly review our operation 

and 

strategy 

risks 

affecting 

the 

sustainability of our businesses. The 

Group is on constant lookout for 

changes 

in 

business 

trends 

and 

opportunities to shift our business 

directions 

accordingly. 

This 

is 

accompanied by consultation with 

professionals, to ensure that the 

Group’s directions are on the right 

track. 

We also seriously consider and assess 

any weakness and lapse in controls 

made known during audits and strive to 

enhance the internal controls to ensure 

the effectiveness of our controls, as well 

as to ensure the true and fair view of 

the financial statements. 

PERFORMANCE IN 2019 

Economic value generated by the Group 

was reported at S$28.9 million in 2019, 

increased from S$28.8 million in 2018. 

Total expenditure incurred by the 

Group, excluding Employee Wages &amp; 

Benefits was S$14.63 million in 2019, 

decreased from S$17.0 million in 2018. 

Group net profit was S$3.8 million in 

2019, compared to S$0.2 million in 

2018.  

The increase of Group net profit was 

mainly 

due 

to 

collection 

and 

recognition of revenue derived from 

final settlement of variation orders, 

income derived from settlement of 

finance lease receivables for a vessel 

and recovery of loss allowance made for 

third party trade receivables. 

Earnings per share (“EPS”) was 3.30 

cents in 2019, up from EPS of 0.69 cents 

in 2018. 

The Group incurred a cost of capital of 

S$328,000 in 2019, decreased from 

S$421,000 in 2018. Cost of capital 

includes 

interest 

paid 

on 

bank 

borrowings and finance lease. The 

Group declared a cash dividend of a 

total of 0.45 cents per ordinary share 

(comprising a first and final dividend of 

0.15 cents, as well as a special dividend 

of 0.30 cents) for financial year ended 

31 December 2019 (subject to approval 

from Shareholders at the forthcoming 

Annual 

General 

Meeting 

of 

the 

Company to be held on 5 June 2020). No 

cash dividend was paid for the financial 

year ended 31 December 2018. 

Government Taxes 

In 2019, the Group received an amount 

of S$50,640 from government grant for 

financial assistance for employee wages 

and benefits and capital investment 

matters. 

The Group paid tax of approximately 

S$902,000 in 2019. Taxes paid are net of 

any tax rebates granted by the 

government, where applicable.

decreased from S$11.6 million for 460 

employees in 2018, in the form of 

salary, wages, pension scheme based 

on respective jurisdictions (mainly 

Singapore’s Central Provident Fund 

(“CPF”)), foreign workers’ levy, skill 

development fund and other staff 

benefits (including, but not limited to, 

welfare given to staff and bonuses). 

Staff costs were lower despite rising 

headcount as the Group managed to 

source for cheaper labour in 2019, 

mainly from non-executive category. 

Singapore’s CPF contributions were 

made in accordance to prevailing 

Central Provident Fund Act. The total 

pension paid, which was included in the 

total staff costs, was S$467,000 in 2019, 

increased from S$449,000 in 2018. 

A detailed account of the full financial 

performance and position of the Group 

can be found in the Annual Report 

2019. 

Economic Value Delivered to the 

Society 

In 2019, the Group generated S$28.9

the governments.  

The Group has retained S$2.9 million of 

economic value, where the Group had 

decided to conserve the economic 

value for its business operations.

TRUE AND FAIR VIEW OF THE  

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Financial information presented in the 

Annual 

Report is a medium of 

communication to the Stakeholders in 

informing how the Group is performing. 

We understand the importance of our 

Stakeholders 

and 

management 

in 

making informed decisions based on 

the Annual Report that presents a true 

and fair view of the Group’s financial 

performance and position.  

We ensure that the information 

contained in our Annual Reports are 

both 

adequate 

and 

free 

from 

misstatement (which can arise from an 

error, or from a fraudulent activity that 

remains undiscovered). Efforts made to 

ensure the true and fair view of the 

financial statements includes: 

 Implementation of procedures; 

 Sending the finance team for 

training and updates; 

 Implementation of whistle-blowing 

procedures; and 

Introduction of contractual provisions 

to allow the Company to reclaim 

incentive components linked to the 

performance of the Company.

Implementation of procedures 

The 

Group 

has 

implemented 

procedures manual to govern the 

Group on how operational procedures 

should be carried out, and how 

employees should behave and perform 

in the interest of the Group. 

Training and Updates 

We periodically sent our finance team 

for training and updates on the relevant 

reporting standards, such as those 

required by the Financial Reporting 

Standards of Singapore, the Code, SGX 

Catalist Rules, and so on. This is to 

ensure that the Annual Report is 

prepared in accordance to the required 

standards and rules so as to give a true 

and fair view of the financial position 

and performance of the Group. The 

above function is undertaken by the 

Committee (refer to the section “Our 

Commitment 

to 

Sustainable 


ES GROUP (HOLDINGS) LIMITED 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 

OUR ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY 

23

Operation” of this report for the 

detailed 

responsibility 

of 

the 

Committee) to oversee compliance 

matters of the Annual Report. 

Whistle-blowing 

Whistle-blowing procedures have been 

implemented 

to 

ensure 

that 

all 

management personnel acts in the 

interest of the Stakeholders. All this 

information is reported as required 

under the Code and can be found in the 

Annual Report 2019 page 30. Whistle-

blowing policy and whistle-blowing 

reports received (if any), will be 

assessed by the Audit and Risk 

Committee from time to time. Please 

refer 

to 

the 

section 

on 

“Our 

Commitment 

to 

a 

Sustainable 

Operation” in this report for further 

details.

Incentive-linked remuneration 

The remuneration of the Executive 

Directors’ and the key Management is 

linked to the performance of the 

Company (please refer to the Annual 

Report 2019 page 23). With effect from 

2018, the Company has adopted 

contractual provisions to safeguard 

against 

material 

misstatement 

of 

financial statements to deter and 

recover from the unlikely event of 

deliberate 

manipulation 

of 

the 

performance of the Company. Such 

contractual 

provisions 

allow 

the 

Company 

to 

reclaim 

incentive 

components of the remuneration from 

the Executive Directors’ and the key 

Management 

in 

the 

exceptional 

circumstances of misstatement of 

financial results or misconduct resulting 

in financial loss to the Company. 

PROJECT AND QUALITY 

MANAGEMENT 

New building and repair segment 

It is known that ineffective, poor 

planning and slow execution of a 

project plan can result in costly 

avoidable losses (such as wastages, 

disputable damages, overrun in project 

costs, liquidated damage claims and 

terminations from customers). At such, 

we have invested heavily on effective 

project management system to ensure 

effective and safe project execution 

with high quality deliverables.  

We have testified the above with the 

attainment of ISO, OHSAS and BizSafe 

Star certifications since 2009, which is a 

testament 

to 

our 

effective 

implementation of the processes across 

the Group. The certifications require us 

to be audited on an annual basis, which 

ensure 

that 

the 

above 

mention 

processes stay effective on a continuing 

basis. 

Shipping segment 

Similarly, we have high confidence on 

the operational processes in the ship 

chartering 

and 

marine 

supplies 

divisions to deliver high quality and 

timely charter services as well as 

efficient and timely supply of marine 

supplies.  

The ship chartering division constantly 

monitors the performances and co-

ordination between the relevant agents 

and brokers to ensure that the vessels 

are competently crewed and well 

maintained at all times so as to ensure 

high 

utilisation 

with 

repeated 

customers at profitable rates, as well as 

avoid any downtime arising from poor 

co-ordination and planning which will 

result in demurrages and loss of charter 

opportunities. 

In the context of marine supplies, the 

division will ensure that the supply 

chain is properly managed, by fulfilling 

pre-requisites that may be imposed by 

suppliers so as to receive the supplies in 

good time shortly before fulfilling the 

promised 

delivery 

date 

to 

the 

customers. This mitigate risk arising 

from poor coordination with vendors, 

ship owners and ship managers that will 

result in poor customers’ satisfaction 

and loss of business opportunities. 

DIVERSIFICATION OF TRADES 

The Group understands the importance 

of diversification as the marine and 

offshore oil and gas industries are 

cyclical in nature. Any downturn in 

global or trade specific economic 

conditions such as the financial crisis in 

2008 and 2009, as well as the downturn 

in marine and offshore oil and gas 

industries due to the drastic fall in oil 

prices since 2015, will adversely affect 

us. There is no assurance that future 

economic downturns will not occur and 

hence steps to diversify are constantly 

being evaluated and implemented.  

Furthermore, diversification creates 

synergy, and allows sharing of technical 

resources, reduction of operational 

costs, higher market penetration and 

expansion of customer and supplier 

base.  

Besides expanding to undertake EPC, 

we are also constantly looking into 

possibilities 

of 

acquisition 

or 

establishment 

of 

complementary 

businesses or joint ventures with 

sustainable parties as and when 

opportunities arise. 

In 2012, we launched our first bareboat 

charter vessel after assessing the 

performance of this segment and noted 

its potential. In 2016, we officially 

placed more resources to further 

develop the shipping segment, with the 

acquisition of an additional vessel and 

started spot chartering services in 

December 2016. In mid-2017, we 

started the marine supplies division.  

In 2019, our focus of expanding the 

shipping segment continued from 2018, 

where revenue from the shipping 

segment stood at 22.8% (2018: 23.7%, 

2017: 16.8%) of the Group’s revenue. 

With the diversification into the 

shipping segment, the Group’s revenue 

contribution concentration on new 

building and repair of offshore and 

marine structures and vessels has 

reduced.  

MITIGATION OF IMPACT FROM 

CLIMATE CHANGE 

The demand for oil and gas is likely to 

continue to change structurally in the 

coming years, with the Paris Climate 

Agreement first passed in 12 December 

2015 and with the recent COP42 in 

Katowice, Poland (also known as the 

24th Conference of the Parties to the 

United Nations Framework Convention 

on Climate Change (“UNFCCC”)). 


ES GROUP (HOLDINGS) LIMITED 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 

OUR ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY 

24

The conference continues to press 

nations to commit even tremendous 

global climate efforts to slow down 

global 

warming 

to 

under 

2°C, 

emphasising that current efforts are far 

from efficient in achieving the goal.  The 

conference also gave birth to a common 

climate rulebook, known as the Paris 

Agreement Rulebook (also common 

referred as the Katowice Rulebook) that 

aims to regulate on carbon emissions 

reduction and reporting. 

Carbon 

emissions 

are 

directly 

correlated to the demand in the marine, 

offshore, oil and gas, where demand is 

likely to reduce over time with 

renewable energy sources sought for. 

This may drive oil prices to new low 

progressively which we expect this may 

affect us in the following manner: 

New building and repair segment 

Business activities in shipyards are 

expected to be impacted, and thus our 

core business will take a hit financially. 

As the market demand changes in the 

marine, offshore, oil and gas industries 

alongside with global trend, we will 

have to adapt and grow with the new 

changes. For instance, we have since 

2016 shifted our focus from the new 

building and conversion projects to the 

repair projects as we expected the 

demand for the new building and 

conversion to weaken over time. On the 

same note, we have also continued to 

focus on the expansion in our shipping 

segment this year. 

Shipping segment 

Our vessels are oil tank bunkers 

designed for the transportation of 

marine and gas oil for oil and gas 

companies. The impact of global 

warming will result in a change in 

market condition, either due to a 

change in the terrain throughout the 

region or the change in demand for 

chartering services.  

We have been sensitive to the size of 

our fleet and the physical size of our 

vessels while we expand this new 

segment. 

We 

constantly 

monitor 

market conditions within Southeast 

Asia, assess market competition before 

we decide on the viability of expanding 

our fleet size and vessel type to satisfy 

the current market condition. 

Please refer to section “Diversification 

of 

Trade” 

in 

this 

report 

for 

diversification efforts that further 

mitigate this risk.

is 

evaluated and reported. 

 Circulated Supplier Code of Conduct 

on 21 November 2019. 

 Continue to evaluate the impact at 

each point of supply chain in relation 

to sustainability and report on them. 

Management Approach 

The effectiveness of our sustainability 

efforts can only be optimised with the 

proper management of each major point 

of our supply chain, which ranges from 

the beginning of the supply chain (i.e. 

suppliers and subcontractors) to the final 

end user (charterers, contractors and 

end-user). Their sustainable efforts 

affect the performance of ours indirectly. 

The boundary of this topic can be wide, 

extending to a customer or supplier that 

we might not have direct contact, but 

may affect our sustainability efforts. We 

will however restrict our boundary to 

only active efforts that are applicable to 

our 

immediate 

suppliers, 

subcontractors, charterer, contractors, 

or end-user due to the practicality 

constraint. 

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT 

New building and repair segment 

In our core business, we primarily 

contract with and supply skilled labour 

and services to a shipyard (i.e. the 

contractor), 

acting 

as 

a 

resident 

subcontractor. 

The 

contractor 

is 

primarily 

responsible 

with 

the 

procurement of the required equipment 

and 

materials 

for 

the 

building, 

conversion and repairs work on the 

vessels. 

The 

contractor 

imposes 

regulations to regulate us, such as on 

areas of safety, material handling, and so 

on. 

We 

are 

responsible 

for 

the 

procurement 

of 

safety 

equipment, 

components and small equipment in the 

course of the supply of skilled labour and 

services. The completed job is first 

handed over to our contractor who will 

in turn handover the vessel once it is 

completed and ready for voyage. 

Shipping segment 

The shipping segment comprises of ship 

chartering, and the trading of marine 

supplies to vessels. The execution of a 

complete ship charter starts by charterer 

engaging us to transport liquid oil from 

Singapore 

to 

a 

Southeast 

Asia 

destination, we then engage port agents 

(both local and the Southeast Asia 

region), commercial managers, ship 

managers, 

and 

suppliers 

supplying 

marine gas oil and other marine supplies 

for the operation of our vessels.

As required by the Marine and Port 

Authority of Singapore (“MPA”) and in 

line 

with 

International 

Maritime 

Organisation 

(“IMO”), 

we 

will 

periodically conduct surveys on the 

vessels to ensure that it is optimal for 

voyages. 

We 

engage 

professional 

surveyors, equipment manufacturers, 

and subcontractors to survey, supply 

equipment, and service the vessels. 

In our marine supplies division, we 

engage suppliers and subcontractors for 

the bespoke fabrication of vessel’s 

components as well as the trading of 

consumables on board vessels that are 

required by the customer. Goods, 

components and services are acquired 

from suppliers, and the requested goods 

are subsequently delivered to the 

customers. 

Management 

We have finalised our first Supplier Code 

of Conduct and circulated it to all our 

suppliers on 21 November 2019. This 

Supplier Code of Conduct is expected to 

be 

abided 

by 

all 

suppliers 

and 

subcontractors 

to 

ensure 

the 

sustainability of their operations in all 

areas of economic, environment, social 

and governance, which comprises of 

topic on business conduct, labour 

practices, 

health 

and 

safety, 

and 

environmental management. We believe 

that this will positively value-add to our 

sustainability effort throughout our 

supply chain and even benefit our 

suppliers themselves. 

New suppliers are assessed for any bad 

reputation and records, together with 

any presence of applicable certifications 

and licenses. These are credentials 

towards 

key 

sustainability 

factors 

relevant to us. Continuing assessments, 

such as mandated reporting, inspection 

visits or enquiry of information, shall be 

made 

accordingly 

to 

ensure 

the 

standards of safety and health, quality, 

and environment. We will make the 

necessary changes upon observation of 

unsatisfactory standard. 

As for customers, we will ensure that the 

provision of the sales or services are not 

directly associated to matters on breach 

of safety, financial and environmental 

scandals, 

or 

any 

other 

unethical 

practices. 

For those parties who are other than our 

immediate suppliers, subcontractors, 

charterer, contractors, or end-user, we 

will made effort to disassociate in the 

event that it is made known to us 

through credible sources (such as 

professional consultants, public news, 

and etc.) that there is breach of safety, 

financial and environmental scandals, or 

any other unethical practices. 

The Group is committed to make 

continuous efforts to work closely with 

parties in our supply chain to ensure best 

practices and alignment of policies. We 

are opened to listen to them. 

Commitment 

We 

practice 

fair 

competition 

in 

compliance of applicable competition 

laws and regulations in our businesses. In 

2019, there are no legal actions taken 

against the Group for anti-competitive 

behaviour, anti-trust, and monopoly 

practices.


ES GROUP (HOLDINGS) LIMITED 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 

OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE 

26

OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE

Management approach 

Environmental effort is an increasing hot 

topic around the world, and Singapore 

has committed on environmental effort 

with the signing of Paris Agreement on 

22 

April 

2016 

followed 

by 

the 

ratification on 21 September 2016. The 

Group is committed to participate in the 

effort of being “green” to be aligned 

with the nation and global effort.  

The inaugural Sustainability Report 

published in November 2018 for the 

reporting year of 2017 has initiated our 

attention to environmental issues in 

relation to our sustainability. We had 

then identified the existing efforts we 

have made as well as the relating 

Sustainability Factors that we can work 

on 

as 

part 

of 

our 

effort 

and 

commitment. We have implemented 

controls since 2018 to record data on 

energy consumption and the associated 

emissions.  

The boundary of this topic is restricted 

to 

the 

operations 

in 

Singapore, 

excluding vessels due to the limitation in 

control to capture data from vessels, 

and the insignificance of the overseas 

operations (as illustrated in “Our 

Sustainability Topics” in this report). We 

have chosen not to extend our boundary 

to the consumption made indirectly in 

our core business’ contractor’s shipyard 

due to the limited access to and 

availability of that information. We will 

only be able to report the consumption  

directly from the service provider or 

supplier 

where 

consumption 

information is readily available. We 

apply the Precautionary Principle (as 

described in The Rio Declaration on 

Environment and Development (1992)

Principle 

15) 

via 

the 

applicable 

legislation and regulations in our 

business to stay in compliance to the 

abovementioned 

legislation 

and 

regulations, where efforts are detailed 

below. 

ENERGY CONSUMPTION 

We have started tracking our energy 

consumption data for the Group in 2018, 

but 

this 

is 

only 

for 

the 

direct 

consumption of energy purchased from 

service providers.  

In 2019, the Group consumed a total of 

994,519 kWh of energy in the form of 

electricity, gas and fuel purchased from 

service providers, representing a slight 

increase from 938,575 kWh in year 

2018. Out of which 43,699 kWh (2018: 

89,303 kWh) relates to energy used in 

dormitories 

and 

are 

subsequently 

reimbursed to the Group from workers 

staying in the dormitory. 100% of the 

energy consumed is non-renewable. 

EMISSIONS

The Group reported a total emission8 of 

313 Metric tonnes (“MT”) of carbon 

dioxide (“CO2”) in 2019, increased by 13 

MT from 2018. After deducting emission  

related 

to 

the 

consumption 

subsequently reimbursed to the Group 

from workers staying in the dormitory of 

18 MT (2018: 36 MT), of which all are 

Scope 2 Emissions, the Group would 

report a net emission of 295 MT (2018: 

264 

MT). 

Total 

emission 

figure 

comprises of Scope 1 Emissions9 of 200 

MT and Scope 2 Emissions10 of 113 MT. 

The composition of emissions only 

includes CO2. For 2019, we have not 

quantified the emissions from our 

vessels, 

and 

is 

confined 

within 

Singapore’s operations. 

Scope 1 Emissions comprises direct 

emissions of fossil fuel consumed 

directly by the Group’s vehicles. Scope 2 

Emissions comprises electricity and gas 

consumed by the Group. The resources 

reported here is the same as those 

reported 

in

WATER COMSUMPTION 

The 

Group 

reported 

a 

total 

consumption of 16,658 cubic metres 

(“m3”) in 2019 and 40,630m3 in 2018. 

The significant reduction is due to 

consumption being overcharged in 

earlier months. The Group receive a 

refund for the overpayment in August 

2019. The water consumed is 100% 

from municipal water supplies. 

EFFLUENTS AND WASTE 

New building and repair segment 

The core business involves heavy usage 

of materials. However, as a resident 

subcontractor based in our contractor’s 

shipyard, we are bounded by the 

regulations imposed by the shipyard on 

how materials are used and disposed. 

The onus is on us to abide to the 

regulations set out by the contractor. 

All materials for the purpose of new 

building and repair works, are issued by 

the 

shipyard. 

Excess 

materials 

unutilised are returned to the shipyard 

for reuse. Any minor remnants of 

material are disposed in locations 

designated by the shipyard, and 

subsequently 

collected 

by 

waste 

collector. This ensure that wastage 

contributed 

by 

our 

workers 

are 

minimised and properly handled.

On the part of the Group’s effort, we 

educate 

our 

employees 

on 

the 

importance of efficient usage to reduce 

material 

wastage. 

Trainings 

are 

provided to improve the skillset of the 

workers, which will also translate to 

lesser wastage arising from inefficient 

use 

of 

materials. 

The 

materials 

purchased directly by us are safety 

equipment and small materials and 

they are disposed according to the 

shipyard regulation. 

Shipping segment 

Our vessels are registered under MPA’s 

Ship Registry of Ships (“SRS”), and the 

pre-requisites relating to the vessels are 

fulfilled 

through 

the 

classification 

awarded by Bureau Veritas and Nippon 

Kaiji 

Kyokai, 

which 

covers 

the 

compliance to various key convention 

and regulations set by the IMO and the 

International 

Labour 

Organization 

(“ILO”). Included in the classification is  

the various certifications covering key 

environmental conventions as seen in 

Table 21. 

The certifications are credentials of 

efforts taken to ensure that the 

structure, equipment systems, fittings 

and material used for the vessels fully 

comply with the requirements to 

prevent environmental pollution, be it 

through 

improper, 

unintentional, 

and/or accidental discharge of oil, spill 

of oil, disposal of garbage waste, and 

discharge 

of 

ozone 

depleting 

substances.  

OUR EFFORTS  

We continue to commit in reducing the 

use of carbon-emitting transportation 

to transport our workers. We are still 

using dormitory that houses workers 

within 

walkable 

distance 

to 

the 

shipyard. Out of the total workforce of 

492, 213 and 44 workers are currently 

staying in the shipyard and near (i.e. 

walking 

distance) 

the 

shipyard 

respectively.  

To further reduce the indirect emission 

of GHG via the use of public transport, 

we have and are still providing each 

worker with a bicycle. This is in line with 

the nation’s effort of a “Car-lite” city. 

For other workers staying at our own 

dormitory which is located outside the  

shipyard, we transport them to the 

shipyard using commercial buses and 

we ensure that the buses are fully 

occupied to maximise efficiency of each 

bus-trip.  

As mentioned in “Our Letter to 

Stakeholders” above, our Group has 

switched from using heavy marine fuel 

oil to low sulphur fuel oil in November 

2019 for our vessel, ES Aspire. This is in 

compliance with IMO 2020, and is also 

part of our Group’s effort to move 

towards a lower emission future. 

OTHER COMPLIANCE MATTERS 

The Group has no operations that are 

on or near any habitat that are 

protected or have high biodiversity 

value as identified by international 

bodies such as the International Union 

for Conservation of Nature (“IUCN”). 

As of the reporting date of the Annual 

Report 2019, the Group has not been 

penalised for any non-compliance of 

environmental laws and regulations 

imposed by Singapore and will continue 

to work with the relevant authorities to 

stay updated so as to continue to 

comply with the laws and regulations.
