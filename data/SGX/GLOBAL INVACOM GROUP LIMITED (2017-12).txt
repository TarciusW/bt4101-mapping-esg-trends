FOREWORD BY EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

Global Invacom Group Limited (“GIGL”, or the “Group”) wants to be a good corporate citizen with regards to 

sustainability. However, we are constrained in many aspects due to specification demands from our customer base. 

The Group sells the majority of its products to household name broadcasters and is duty bound to meet stringent 

product specification requirements. We will continue to review and move our customers towards a more sustainable 

direction, but it is not always easy or possible.

The Group is constantly trying to reduce the amount of metal, plastics, resins, paper, cardboard and electronics 

used during production. In the current financial year, we have had a lot of success in reducing the physical size and 

weight of metal housings, printed circuit boards and cardboard packaging content for our RF Low Noise Blocks and 

switches, and in using biodegradable (compostable) plastic bags, along with reduced amounts of cardboard and 

foam based spacers.

The use of smaller metal housings has reduced the size and weight of our products, which in turn has allowed GIGL 

to ship more products per container, as has the use of slip sheets instead of pallets, all helping to reduce our carbon 

footprint.

The Group is currently exploring initiatives to produce product in the locality of our customers, so that we can be 

more flexible in meeting changing demand and can reduce stock in transit to a minimum buffer level. We have also 

explored the use of packaging foams made from starch and natural fibers, but concluded, together with potential 

suppliers, that this technology is not yet fully developed to a level suitable for our type of products.

We have considered the use of solar power at our plants in Shanghai, People’s Republic of China and Smithfield, 

United States of America, but have yet to commit to investing in the required infrastructure as both sites are leased and 

we have yet to be convinced of the longevity of either site given the payback period required to justify the investment.

We continue to explore all avenues to improve our carbon footprint while taking into account our customers’ 

requirements and the cost of migration.

BOARD STATEMENT

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Group recognises the need to disclose our environmental, social and 

governance (“ESG”) practices and performances and has produced its first sustainability report to shareholders for 

the financial year ended 31 December 2017.

The Group is committed to create constant growth through sustainable practices and effort. Pivotal to the Group’s 

continued growth is the Board’s belief that our key stakeholders’ interests are of the utmost importance. GIGL acts 

in the best interest of our shareholders’ long term interest through our continuing effort of being financially prudent 

whilst managing our risks (operational and strategic).

Being a listed company on the Singapore’s Stock Exchange and the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange in 

the United Kingdom, GIGL will continue to uphold transparent communication channels with key stakeholders, to 

provide a safe working environment for its employees, and to be a good corporate citizen.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 3





Sustainability Report










Sustainability Report

ABOUT THIS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT, REPORTING LOCATIONS, BOUNDARIES AND PERIOD

The Group’s first sustainability report (the “SR”) covers the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 (“2017”). 

This SR was prepared using reference from Rule 711A and 711B of the Listing Manual of the Singapore Stock Exchange 

(“SGX-ST”) and was prepared using the “Global Reporting Initiative Standards: Core option” (“GRI Standards”) as 

a guideline.

Unless otherwise stated, this report covers the ESG aspects of the Group’s operations across three regions broadly 

defined as America, Europe and APAC (covering Asia and Rest of the World).

The Board will continue to oversee the identification and management of sustainability practices. Our Management 

team will assist to identify, measure and address sustainability related matters on an ongoing basis.

No external assurance was sought for the preparation of this SR.

GOVERNANCE AND DISCLOSURES

The Board, supported by our senior management, was involved in the first assessment and review of sustainability 

issues. Oversight of this first sustainability report was delegated to Mr Malcolm John Burrell, an Executive Director 

and the Chief Risk Officer.

Nonetheless, the Board continues to have oversight on sustainability issues and responsibilities including the 

identification of internal and external stakeholders, their engagement, broad base material topics, and in future years, 

tracking of their performance and progress.

In conducting its business, GIGL always seeks to adhere to local legislations and upholds a high standard of corporate 

governance.

A detailed report on our governance can be found in our Annual Report FY2017 (“AR FY2017”), pages 13 to 27.

WEBSITE AND FEEDBACK

To minimise the environmental impact, the Group has not printed any physical copies of this SR. The SR is available 

on our website: https://www.globalinvacom.com

We welcome our stakeholders to provide your views and feedback. You may email us at SR@globalinvacom.com

RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

The Board is responsible for risk governance and its management practices. The Board has the responsibility to 

ensure that sound system of internal controls are in place to mitigate risk and safeguard shareholders’ interests.

The Board approves key risk management policies, the level of tolerance and oversight on design, monitoring, and 

implementation of risk management and the internal controls system. Further information on our risk management 

and internal control can be found in the Report on Corporate Governance in AR FY2017.

CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT

The Group does not currently have any comprehensive or generic Code of Conduct. We intend to review and 

consolidate our common practices and incorporate them into a Group policy handbook with a view to clearly defining 

written rules for our employees when dealing with third parties.

GIGL has in place a Whistle-Blowing policy, overseen by our Audit and Risk Committee (“ARC”), which provides a 

channel for our employees to raise concerns they may have about potential or actual improprieties directly to the Lead 

Independent Director. GIGL protects whistle-blowers from any form of retaliation, harassment or other discriminatory 

acts.

ANTI-BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION POLICY

GIGL has zero tolerance of bribery and corruption, and employees are expected to uphold the highest standards of 

professional conduct. There have been no reportable incidents of any employee engaging in bribery or corruption.

The Group also confirms that there was no monetary incentive or equivalent provided to any politically exposed person 

or political parties to secure any contract.

Sustainability Report

CUSTOMER PRIVACY

In the course of ordinary business, GIGL operates at the business to business level, and hence the collection of 

customer’s personal data is minimal. The Group has not identified any substantiated complaints concerning breaches 

of customer privacy.

The Group has appointed a Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) to oversee customer data collection in Singapore. Our 

Chief Risk Officer has oversight of the data protection regulations in the various countries in which we operate.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK

As part of the GRI Standards disclosures, the Group has adopted the recommended approach of the four reporting 

principles namely stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context, its materiality, and completeness when determining 

material, strategic and reporting issues.

The likelihood and impact matrix for risk assessment was aligned with the Group’s sustainability strategy when 

prioritising material ESG factors.

COMMITMENT AND DISCLOSURES OF KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (“KPIs”)

All data in the SR was extracted internally from our kept documents and/or records to ensure accuracy. While the 

SR does not specifically evaluate performance against established targets, the Group is committed to set targets 

and goals for future reporting.

As this is our first year of reporting, data gathering was not complete for certain indicators and regions. As such, 

wherever data is inadequate or not available for presentation, we have included an explanatory note.

The Group hopes to establish and implement data tracking and gathering mechanisms for improved reporting going 

forwards. As a baseline, we have put in place certain commitment (targets) using key performance indicators.

WASTE AND EFFLUENTS

The waste generated at our manufacturing plants includes scrap metal, wood and cardboard. All waste is disposed using 

waste contractors hired by our respective manufacturing plants in accordance with the prevailing laws, and disposed of 

through recycling, landfill or incineration. Where possible, for instance in the case of scrap metal, our waste is recycled by 

specialist contractors.

In 2017, approximately 1,875 tonnes of non-hazardous waste was generated by the Group, of which approximately 1,471 

tonnes (78%) was recycled. Hazardous waste is disposed of by specialist waste contractors.

reported in 2017. The Group ended the year with a total of 971 employees, 55% of whom were female and 45% were male.

The Group complies with all labour laws in the regions in which we operate. We have a zero tolerance of the use of child labour, 

both within our own facilities and in those of our suppliers.

Our management teams throughout the Group are largely drawn from local people, with the exception of the executive team 

who are all from the United Kingdom. Of the 71 members of the management teams, 27% are female and 73% are male.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND TURNOVER

The Group offers a range of benefits to its employees, which varies by region and includes some or all of the following – parental 

leave, life insurance, healthcare, and pension provision. As previously mentioned, all employees receive a regular appraisal. The 

various entities within the Group also hold events such as team building exercises and staff dinners.

The overall staff turnover rate of the Group in 2017 was 12%. Part of this was due to the closure of our operations in Shenzhen, 

People’s Republic of China.

Going forwards, we will be looking to develop our engagement with our employees, and will also continue to monitor and 

report on our staff turnover, with the aim of improving our employee engagement and reducing staff turnover (other than where 

required for operational reasons).

HEALTH AND SAFETY

The Group is committed to providing a safe working environment for its employees and also to providing products which are 

safe for its customers to use.

Each of the Group’s facilities complies fully with all local occupational health and safety (OSH) regulations and there were no 

breaches identified in 2017. There were no fatalities or serious work-related injuries, and neither were there any incidents of 

work-related diseases. Going forwards, the Group will be aiming to provide further OSH data including injury rate, occupational 

disease rate, lost day rate and absentee rate.

Product safety is inherent in our product design, product manufacturing and material procurement processes. The Group is 

not aware of any non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary codes, nor has it been made aware of any safety issues 

arising out of the use of our products in 2017.

SOCIOECONOMIC

The Group takes seriously its obligations to comply with the legislation and standards in the regions in which it operates. In 

2017 there was no reportable incidents of significant fines due to non-compliance with existing labour laws and/or regulations 

across the Group.

COMMUNITY

As a good corporate citizen, GIGL strives to minimise our impact on the environment. Our various facilities largely draw their 

workforces from the local communities in which they are based. The Group currently makes available a nominal amount for 

each entity to support local charitable causes. Going forwards, the Group intends to review and ideally increase its charitable 

involvement and contributions to the various local communities in which it operates.

INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACTS

The Group’s operations contributed to the economies of the countries in which it operates. We have sustained and created 

employment, up-skilled local workforces through training and on-the-job experience, and contributed to tax revenues.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 13





Sustainability Report

SUPPLY CHAIN AND PROCUREMENT POLICY

The Group recognises the crucial role that its suppliers play in the overall operation and success of the business. We are 

dependent on our suppliers, and so it is generally in the Group’s interest for our suppliers to continue to be successful, whilst 

supplying quality components at a good price.

The Group also recognises that the overall sustainability of its operations depends not just on its own performance in the ESG 

aspects, but also on that of its suppliers.

Whilst we have some way to go in formulating and implementing a policy in respect of the sustainability of our suppliers, we do 

conduct formal assessments on many of our existing key suppliers, and also on new suppliers. These assessments do cover 

some ESG aspects, including the use of child labour.

Going forwards, the Group intends to formulate a Group-wide procurement policy, which will include a requirement for suppliers 

to report on the key relevant ESG aspects.

LOCAL SUPPLIERS

The Group strives to keep it supply chains short and local. However, many of the components used in the Group’s products, 

notably semi-conductors, are sourced from large multi-national corporations, and so it is not always possible to source locally. 

Furthermore, the need to remain competitive may lead to the sourcing of components from the most cost-effective suppliers, 

which may be located off-shore. The Group will review the practicality of providing objective supply chain data with respect to 

locality in its future reports.

MEMBERSHIP OF ASSOCIATIONS

The Group participates in various professional associations and business federations. A list of these is provided below:

• 

The Society of Broadband Professionals (SCTE)

•
