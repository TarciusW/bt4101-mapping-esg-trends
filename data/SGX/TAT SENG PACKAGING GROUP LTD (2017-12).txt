STRATEGY AND ANALYSIS



After the historic summit in September 2015 when 

193 members of  the United Nations (“UN”) made a 

commitment to adopt the 17 Goals and 169 targets 

in its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 

environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters 

became 

increasingly 

important 

to 

multinational 

companies.

Our major customers are increasingly interested in the 

Group’s ESG impact. This directly affects our business 

in the form of widespread demand for packaging 

produced from paper certified by Forest Stewardship 

Council (FSC®), a platform of managing forests and 

harvesting wood in an ethical way for sustainable 

development. In response to this trend, we now procure 

a significant portion of our paper roll raw material from 

FSC® certified suppliers.

Recycling Paper



Paper is the main raw material used at the Group’s 

production factories. The 12th UN Sustainable 

Development 

Goal 

advocating 

responsible 

consumption and production has among its targets 

the reduction of waste generation through prevention, 

reduction, recycling and reuse. We have invested 

extensively in recycling infrastructure and that has 

enabled us to recycle close to 100% of our paper 

waste.

Stakeholder Engagement



The Group’s vision is to be a leading manufacturer and 

supplier of corrugated paper packaging products. With 

the widespread attention on ESG integration, we now 

have a mission to adopt international best practices 

that positively impact stakeholders. Stakeholder 

engagement is a key part of achieving the triple bottom 

line (which includes social, environmental, financial 

measures). It is also a requirement of the Global 

Reporting Initiative, which we began adopting last year.

We conduct annual customer surveys to ensure high 

product satisfaction. Employee feedback is obtained 

by each department through on-going dialogue. 

Follow-up action and response is documented.

Last 

year, 

we 

strengthened 

our 

stakeholder 

engagement mechanism by reaching out to our  

employees, customers, suppliers, and independent 

directors for feedback on ESG matters.

Statement from the most senior decision maker of the organisation


Tat Seng Packaging Group Ltd   /   Sustainability Report FY2017   /   03

Workplace Safety &amp; Health



We recognize the need to accept responsibility for the 

safety and health of all employees. In Singapore, we have 

a Workplace Safety &amp; Health committee with  members 

that include the relevant department supervisors. I am 

glad to report that historically, we have had no incidence 

of serious accidents.

Governance on Anti-corruption 



The Board takes a serious view on corruption as it 

impedes business growth, escalates costs and poses 

serious legal and reputation risks. Each member of 

our senior management is required to make annual 

disclosures of conflict of interest such as  personal or 

family shareholdings in our competitor, supplier, or 

customer.

Community Development



It is our policy to make charitable community development 

contributions each year. Last year, we financially 

sponsored the Rajan Menon Foundation Charity Golf 

event, the Singapore Cancer Society Run and one 

scholarship under the Republic Polytechnic Education 

Fund for a Diploma in Social Enterprise Management.

Commitment



The Board is committed to integrating sustainable 

development into the Group’s strategic formulation.  

The Group has taken steps to ensure our practices 

comply with environmental regulations and will continue 

to do so on a proactive basis. Recently, we acquired 

and installed advanced equipment at our Singapore 

operations to enhance our waste water management 

practice and to comply with regulatory requirements. 

Our Singapore operations has also adopted cleaner 

energy sources, moving away from diesel to more 

environmentally friendly natural gas. These steps are 

part of our continuous effort to minimise the impact of our 

operations on the environment.

Last year, we formed a sustainable development 

committee to promote, monitor, and report our ESG 

practices. The committee reports to our Managing 

Director / CEO, Mr Loh See Moon, and our Executive 

Director, Madam Cheong Poh Hua. Our ESG integration 

process is ultimately endorsed by the Board of Directors.

Dr Allan Yap

Executive Chairman

Goals

Cap operational waste at 4.3% of 

paper consumed in production.

Safe and healthy workplace.

Greater adoption of FSC® Chain 

of Custody.

Strengthen stakeholder 

engagement.

Greener use of energy.

Encourage employee training &amp; 

development.

More rigorous adoption of anti-

corruption practices.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT











We study international best practices to 

determine areas of sustainable development 

that may be relevant to the Group over the 

long term. We have the following goals in 

our stakeholder engagement activities:

• 

Understand stakeholder priorities and 

values in sustainable development.

• 

Align our goals and values with that of 

the stakeholder group.

• 

Improve on environmental,  social and 

governance matters that our activities 

have impact on.

• 

The Group’s adoption of ISO 9001 Quality Management System 

strengthens the confidence of its stakeholders, especially with 

employees, customers, and other business associates. Adoption 

of these industry-wide standards reduces our risk of liability, keeps 

us ahead of legislation and regulatory developments, and reduces 

the environmental burden of our business activities.

• 

We conduct first article inspection, in-process inspection, and last 

article inspection checks at our production line for every batch of 

order.

Reporting Approach and Framework

We refer to the Global Reporting Initiative (2016) as a framework for disclosure inclusion. As the Group’s raw materials 

sigificantly comprise of paper, our management has identified that paper waste management and supplier assessment for 

environmental impact are key material aspects for the Group’s sustainable development.

Workplace safety and occupational health is also a priority as occupational hazards generally exist in a manufacturing 

environment. The Group’s policy is to have clear communication about workplace safety to eliminate hazardous incidents 

that may arise.

Topic Boundaries

Disclosures in this report revolve around our Singapore manufacturing facility. We are monitoring business sustainability 

activities adopted by our operations in China and will look into extending our reporting to include overseas subsidiaries.  

Metrics applicable to GRI core disclosures are reported only if they are a good representation of the impact of our value chains.

(Please refer to page 70 of our Annual Report 2017 for a list of our China subsidiaries.)

The chart below represents external stakeholders’ sentiment on the importance of sustainability issues material to the 

Group relative to internal stakeholders. Proper waste disposal ranks high in the value system of both internal and external 

stakeholders. The Group’s factories are equipped with advanced infrastructure for automatic recycling of wastepaper.

The results are based on a survey conducted in August 2017.

List of Material Topics




Paper waste is automatically collected and

14   /   Company Specific Disclosures





Our manufacturing process requires a large 

amount of paper rolls. In FY2017, our factories in 

China and Singapore consumed about 250,000 

tons of paper rolls. During production, paper rolls 

are trimmed to produce boards and carton boxes. 

One of the main causes of paper waste is the 

trimming of paper.

Paper waste management is very important to 

the Group and we strive to reduce and dispose of 

paper waste responsibly.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

Our raw materials for production mainly comprise of 

paper harvested from wood. Wood is a renewable 

resource. Paper can be recycled several times. 

These raw materials are sourced from external 

suppliers.

Paper waste is compacted into bales at our factory premise.



Improvements 

in 

our 

production 

processes 

reduce  paper wastage and represent improved 

operational 

efficiency. 

Our 

operation 

team 

regularly reviews the practices at our production 

facilities and equipment in order to optimize our 

production results, maximize the effectiveness of 

our paper roll consumption, and ultimately improve 

our management of operation waste.

Our extensive capital investment in recycling 

infrastructure reduces the consumption of forestry 

resources. Our paper shreds are automatically 

collected using conveyor belts under grooves 

on our factory floor. The waste paper is then 

compacted into bales for disposal via a licensed 

wastepaper collection agent.

The external recycling company may then send 

the compacted bales of recovered paper shreds 

back to paper mills for production of pulp used in 

recycled paper.

How we

Responsibility

Most of our raw material is paper roll, and that 

is produced from wood. Deforestation, the 

clearance of forests for conversion of land to a 

non-forest use, accounts for almost the same 

carbon emissions as the entire world’s transport 

sector and is a major driver of biodiversity loss.

Many of our customers now require our paper 

packaging solutions to be certified by the Forest 

Stewardship Council (FSC®).



Policy

We procure paper roll mainly from FSC® certified 

suppliers. The certification system allows us to 

identify, purchase and use wood, paper and other 

forest products produced from well-managed forests 

and/or recycled materials. Adoption of the FSC® 

Chain of Custody means that the paper we use 

as raw material is unlikely to have been harvested 

illegally in violation of traditional or civil rights, or in 

a way that threatens high conservation value areas.

Workplace safety and health is important to the Group as 

occupational hazards generally exist in a manufacturing

and forklifts. 

When workers are overly fatigued or in poor health, there is 

higher risk of a vicious cycle of poor workplace safety  and health

Responsibility

We recognize the need to accept responsibility for 

the safety and health of all employees.

In Singapore, we have a Workplace Safety &amp; 

Health  committee that include various department 

supervisors who monitor, manage, and implement 

workplace safety practices.

The committee meets regularly to develop, plan, 

organize, manage and improve on our workplace 

safety programs. The meeting is chaired by the 

committee chairman who is also our Production 

Manager. The committee secretary is a registered 

Workplace Safety &amp; Health officer.  

Policy

• 

Control risks at workplace

• 

Maintain a safe work environment

• 

Make sure that safety is maintained in the 

handling of all equipment used

• 

Provide easily accessible resources for dealing  

with emergencies and for keeping the workplace 

safe. 

Commitment

Total Workplace Safety and Health (Total WSH) is 

an integrated approach to managing safety, health 

and well-being in the workplace. This approach 

views a safe and healthy workplace as one that has 

workers and managers collaborating in a continual 

improvement process to protect and promote the 

health, safety, and well-being of all workers and the 

sustainability of the workplace. 

Each employee is expected to observe all rules and 

regulations governing safety practices, use the safety 

equipment provided and practice safety at all times. 

Protective Resources

• 

We provide the proper work tools and personal 

protection equipment such as safety shoes, 

respirators, and eyes google to employees 

where necessary. 

• 

We provide employees with ear plugs / ear 

muffs to mask noise pollution arising from our 

machines. To avoid noise-induced deafness, 

employees are required to wear ear plugs / ear 

muffs during working hours at all times.

• 

We engage a healthcare services provider to 

provide a hearing test service at our factory 

premises annually. The hearing test determines 

the hearing ability of all our employees who 

are exposed to excessive noise. All of our 110 

employees in Singapore that are exposed to 

long term noise hazards arising from operation 

of corrugator machines go through this test that 

we fully sponsor.

REGULATORY NON-COMPLIANCE

In January 2018, Tat Seng Packaging Group Ltd (the “Company”) was fined S$12,000 for an incident of non-

compliance with PUB requirements in the discharge of industrial waste water that occurred in 2016. Our Singapore 

operations was previously relying on widely adopted waste water treatment procedures that unfortunately did 

not meet the standards required. 

The Company views the matter seriously and has looked into ways to minimize the impact of the used industrial 

water discharged into the environment. Working closely with waste water treatment equipment vendors, the 

Company has also recently acquired and installed advanced equipment to enhance our waste water management 

practices and to comply with regulatory requirements.

The Company is committed to responsible operations and continues to work together with the relevant authorities 

and our vendors to ensure compliance with environmental regulations.

To the best of our knowledge, the Group has not identified any incidence of non-compliance in its activities
