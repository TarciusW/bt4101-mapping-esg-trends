Supply Chain 

We procure raw materials such as plastic, silica gel, electroplated components from qualified suppliers 

with proven track records. Based on a set of internal metrics comprising (i) quality of products supplied, 

(ii) ability to fulfil contract terms and (iii) financial health of the company, our suppliers are classified and 

placed into “A”, “B”, “C” ranks. This ranking allows us to differentiate our suppliers based on the 

Company’s current needs and expectations. Consequentially, potential financial and supplier risks are 

mitigated and it allows us to build stable and longstanding relationships with our suppliers.  

Recognizing the need for active engagement, we hold meetings and discussions routinely to improve 

communication between Memtech and our key suppliers so as to strengthen collaboration and 

partnerships with them. 

Approximately 96% of our suppliers are China-based. Our top 10 suppliers manufacture plastic particles, 

silica gel, plastic raw materials, metal conductive particles, electroplating equipment and manufacturing 

process.

17 | P a g e 

 



In FY2018, we introduced a new scheme under which incentives would be given to employees who have 

completed R&amp;D projects. Appropriate compensation will also be given to engaged R&amp;D engineers as a 

token of appreciation for their efforts should the project not be able to meet the set goals or targets set. 

FY2018, several new practices were implemented in Nantong.  

R&amp;D Centre 

In line with our sustainable development strategy, we have applied to the Jiangsu Provincial People’s 

Government for permission to establish a provincial-level innovative research and development centre. 

At this research facility, we aim to develop human-computer control modules for use in automobile 

electronic information which are in line to international standards. To better improve oversight and 

management of R&amp;D operations, we have established six new functional departments. They comprise 

of (1) new material development and self-production, (2) new process development, (3) precision 

mould design and manufacturing (4) process design, (5) mass production conversion and (6) IT and 

Finance.   

 

To build and enhance capabilities at this R&amp;D centre, we have recruited two PhD, five Masters and 20 

undergraduates. The facility also has an additional 500 m2 area dedicated towards expansions of our 

laboratories.  

 

With these new additions, we hope to  

• 

Strengthen our organisation’s knowledge and expertise on intellectual property  

• 

Raise and promote industry’s standards and quality  

• 

Spearhead upstream and downstream industrial chain development 

• 

Provide automobile industry with transfer of technological information, solution on 

technological radiation and related consultancy services  

 

Under the leadership and guidance of the Board of Directors, the various committees, namely the 

General Manager, Executive Working Committee, Committee on strategic sustainable development will 

ensure that we are aligned with the Company’s strategy direction.  

 

Meanwhile, according to different orientation of development, we mainly assist and focus on the use 

of new materials and introduction of new technology in order to achieve practical use of our technology.

Smart Factory 

During the year, we enhanced our factories’ capabilities and automated over 600 assembly lines in 

manufacturing operations including mould processing centre, injection moulding, automatic printing, 

painting and assembly.  

 

We invested over RMB 70 million in the construction of new facilities, upgrading works and equipment 

enhancement.  We also made improvements to over 200 assembly lines and consolidated hard and 

software resources. Capabilities 

have also been strengthened with 

the recruitment of subject-matter 

experts 

and 

management-level 

employees at various levels in areas 

of manufacturing, moulding and IT. 

Additionally, more than 2500 sqm 

was 

added 

to 

our 

existing 

workshop area for the construction 

of 

intelligent 

manufacturing 

industrial workshops.  

Case study: Research and Application of Water-based coating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Purpose 

Organic volatiles released from coatings, especially aromatic hydrocarbons and formaldehyde, 

have a serious impact on human health. Water-borne coatings, also known as green coatings or 

environmentally friendly coatings, have significant advantages. They are non-toxic and harmless 

in water when used as a dispersion medium. Water-borne coatings do not cause pollution to the 

environment, are harmless to the ecological environment system and do not have a negative 

impact on human health. 

 

Method 

The environmentally friendly water-borne resins are synthesised and used. The physical properties 

of water-borne coatings can be specified according to customer’s requirement by modifying the 

resin or adding specific water-borne additives. All resin will be manufactured to meet adhesion 

requirements.

Key R&amp;D Achievements 

FY2018 

Modification of Engineering Plastics 

Polycarbonate (“PC”) is an essential component in engineering 

plastics and is one of the commonly used raw materials at 

Memtech. We have developed a new technology to improve the 

toughness of PC through a compounding process aimed at 

strengthening its properties. This enhanced PC has been used in 

our injecting moulding process. 

 

Injection moulding of PC with in-mould polyimide-based Flexible Circuit Board 

 

Embedding a flexible circuit board inside a plastic part is carried out 

by double injection moulding. With the use of the primer 

formulated by our in-house laboratory, an appropriate adhesion 

between the polyimide-based flexible circuit board and plastics has 

been achieved. The adhesion strength can be adjusted according to 

the process requirements.  

 

Continuous Knurling Machine 

 

Our engineers have developed a continuous knurling machine to produce knurled 

nickel strips.  Using this machine, we are now able to produce high quality knurled 

nickel strips achieving much higher production efficiency than the previous 

method of producing it one sheet at a time. The electrical properties of 

conductive pills made with the use of the knurled nickel strip are also improved. 

The conductive pills have a good anti-chatter performance. 

Synthesis and Application of Primer for Thermal Vulcanization Bonding of PEI with Liquid Silicone 

Rubber 

A basic polymer, which is the key component in the primer for thermal vulcanization bonding of 

polyetherimide (“PEI”) with liquid silicone rubber, was prepared by graft copolymerization. Use of the 

primer gives a good adhesion between PEI and silicone rubber. After boiling at 100℃ for 1 hour, the 

bonding strength is maintained, resulting in a cohesive rupture after the peel test. Adhesion strength 

can be catered to customers’ requirements.  

 








 

20 | P a g e 

 



Figure 12: R&amp;D Capabilities at Memtech 

 

 

 

For each R&amp;D project, daily reports and monthly summaries are prepared, together with monthly KPI 

assessment system which combines reward systems and elimination systems. This provides for effective 

supervision of the progress of the projects. We engage external accredited organisations to conduct third-

party performance testing to ensure that we meet European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances 

(“RoHS”) and other hazardous materials testing standards.

Memtech conducts periodic reviews on environmental hazards management process and the results are 

reported to management during environmental safety management meetings to ensure the effectiveness 

of our management systems. Our manufacturing facilities also undergo annual audits from government 

environmental agencies, customers or their appointed third-party auditors on our waste management 

systems. All our operations are compliant with all applicable standards, laws and regulations and we are 

committed to maintaining this track record in FY2019.  

Performance 

1. Wastewater 

The total volume of planned wastewater discharge increased from 273m3 in FY 2017 to 393m3 in FY2018 

because Dongguan had increased water consumption to clean the filters of its new air purifiers. The 

figures below show wastewater processing methods and total volume processed over the past three years.

Total hazardous waste in FY2018 increased by 84.2% compared to last year due to the increase in new 

equipment and additional production facilities, the cleaning of such facilities and increase in tool recycling.. 

Our production 

processes such as 

washing of filters, 

scrubbers, rinsing of 

final products and 

from the use of air 

compressors generate 

wastewater

Water in backwashing 

of filters will be 

recirculated until it is 

deemed to be 

unusable. 

All wastewater will be 

gathered in effluent 

collection tanks for 

pre-treatment to 

ensure that the total 

suspended solids(TSS) 

concentration of the 

wastewater does not 

exceed 4.0 mg/L. 

Wastewater is then 

transported by third-

party contractors to 

treatment facilities.

3. Non-hazardous waste 

For non-hazardous waste, Memtech recovers mainly waste engine oil and scrap packaging materials 

including cardboard and cartons, metal, wood and rubber. Domestic waste is often incinerated and office 

stationery and supplies are disposed of in this manner. In FY2018, there was a slight increase in the total 

weight of non-hazardous waste disposed of. Continuing our effort in moving towards more 

environmentally friendly disposal methods, we recycled 93% of our non-hazardous waste in FY2018.

Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) 

Policy 

Memtech commits to reducing workplace injuries and property damage: 

• 

Our employees are our valuable assets. A positive work attitude and a strong sense of belonging will 

increase employees' performance and their loyalty to the company and will ultimately lead to better 

greater success of Memtech. 

• 

Good OHS embodies the company's "People-oriented", "Creating a harmonious enterprise" and 

“Safety First” ethoses. Being in the manufacturing industry, it is our responsibility to provide a safe, 

secure and healthy working environment for our employees. 

• 

Memtech promotes the implementation of occupational health and safety regulations and ensures 

compliance with all applicable regulations, laws and standards. 

• 

Good OHS efforts can establish a good social image of the Company. 

We have established a strong foundation in OHS through the various policies and practices put in place 

across all three manufacturing facilities, including Personal Protective Equipment (“PPE”) Management 

Policy, Workplace Injury Management Policy and Fire Safety Management Policy. Please refer to SR2017 

for more details on these policies.

Responsibility  

Our Occupational Health Management Committee and Safety Production Committee maintain oversight 

on the implementation of safe production practices and the communication of safety information to 

employees at our manufacturing facilities. Memtech also adopts a performance-linked system group-wide 

to encourage safe production practices according to the guidelines listed in the Safety Production Reward 

Standards.

(Nantong) 

 

Figure 21: Occupational health management 

committee (Dongguan) 

 

Figure 22: Safety production 

committee (Dongguan)_ 

 

Practices  

Memtech adheres to the principle of “safety first, prevention first” which strictly abides by relevant laws 

and regulations. We continuously improve production methods and enhance safety measures to improve 

safety management. We advocate having each employee understanding the need for occupational health 

and safety, and accepting that he must play an important role in safeguarding his own health and safety 

in the work environment. We encourage all employees to provide feedback through our reporting channel 

should there be any cases of safety non-compliance or areas for improvement.

Memtech conducts risks and hazards assessments on the use of equipment and materials to improve 

production processes. Mitigative actions have been taken which include replacement of old and used 

equipment with newer, low-risk equipment and installation of safety protection devices. For employees, 

mandatory induction training covering occupational health and safety, fire safety, use of PPE and ad-hoc 

training based on specific skillset required are provided where necessary. In FY2018, Memtech Dongguan 

conducted occupational disease examination for 360 employees who are exposed to benzene, toluene, 

xylene, methanol, noise, dust and electrical work. 

Safety meetings are held bi-weekly and safety performance appraisals are carried out annually. To ensure 

the effectiveness of management systems, Memtech conducts regular checks and maintenance using our 

safety operation guidelines as a checklist to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 

Periodic evaluation in the occurrence of occupational disease is also performed. Memtech achieved Safety 

Standardisation in Guangdong Province – Level 2 certification and OHSAS 18001:2007 certification in 

FY2017. 

Our internal and external audits show good performance for FY2018. In December 2018, Nantong 

obtained the Standardisation certificate from the Nantong Safety Supervision Bureau and received zero 

negative feedback on related topics.

30 | P a g e 

 



Memtech strives to keep reducing the reported injuries towards the “zero” target. We analyse each 

incident to identify its root cause and ensure corrective actions are implemented to prevent any 

reoccurrence. To this end, we implement stricter supervision and inspection of workplace hazards, 

enforce the use of PPE and maintenance of equipment and impose strict regulations on operation 

procedures. Safety training for our employees are also provided on a more frequent basis.

Employees Training and Advancement 

Policies  

Provision of training for employees is necessary to build a strong, motivated and productive workforce. 

While it increases the productivity of our workforce, it also provides employees with more opportunities 

to grow and advance in their careers at Memtech. This allows us to stay competitive and relevant in our 

industry. The Sustainability Management Committee developed a Staff Training Regulation and Employee 

Training Assessment to better manage training. Please refer to SR2017 for more details on the policies.  

Practices 

Our training framework is prepared according to our employees’ needs. We provide sufficient training for 

new employees before commencement and continuously build capability for existing employees.  

Figure 26: Memtech's training framework 

 

We recognise the importance of providing employees with avenues to voice their opinions on their 

training and advancement programmes. We actively encourage employees to participate in various 

Mandatory induction training such as 

safety training upon commencement 

On-the-job assessment may take 

place to assess employees on their 

technical skillsets and expertise 

After the probation period, an 

evaluation will be conducted within 

the first month of completion and
