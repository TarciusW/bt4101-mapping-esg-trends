material factors and identified 15 material factors for FY2020 which helped shaped our
sustainability strategy and set time-based targets which will be managed with the help of
 our Sustainability Steering Committee.
Since the start of the coronavirus ("COVID-19") outbreak, we have continued implementing
a series of measures to ensure the well-being of our stakeholders. We are monitoring the
pandemic situation and its impacts on our business closely as well as maintaining ongoing
communications on COVID-19 updates with our staff, customers and visitors. We have
implemented precautionary measures to minimise the risk of spread of cOVID-19, such as
daily temperature-taking, mandatory health declarations for employees and customers and
safe distancing measures. During this COVID-19 period, we have also facilitated the smooth
transition of our employees to work from home and conducted our trainings, as well as our
internal board meetings, online. We strive to continue safeguarding the well-being of our
staff and customers and deliver products and services to our valued customers, with minimal
disruptions to our operations.
We seek to grow our role in sustainability and are sure that this will help enhance our quality

Materiality Assessment
Annually, the Board conducts an exercise, involving members of ASA's senior management
team, to review the relevance of ASA's material factors in order to identify if there has been
any shift in priorities among stakeholders and examine any emerging areas of concern. This
was especially important this year as there were many changes in the organisation. As such,
we have engaged an external consultant to assist management with the development of the
sustainability report.
The identification of material issues involved conducting research on global and local trends
in our industry and material topics identified by our peers and industry best practices. In
FY2020, we have identified 15 material topics reflective of our business directions, as
compared to the 12 reported material topics in FY2019. The new ESG factors are Water and
Effluents, Diversity & Equal Opportunity and Customer Health and Safety. This is due to a
combination of the sustainability practices in ASA maturing and our desire to put
sustainability at the forefront of our strategic decision making.
We will continue to assess these material topics on regular basis to ensure their relevance
and importance to our business.

Impact of COVID-19 on Material Factors
Globally, manufacturing industries have taken a major hit from the COVID-19 outbreak. The
disruptions posed by the outbreak could affect the achievement of the ESG targets for FY2021. We
will continue to assess the uncertainties of cOVID-19 on our operations, and the targets for FY2021
will be closely monitored against this assessment and adjusted, if necessary, to reflect the latest
developments of the pandemic.

4.2.
Environmental
4.2.1.
Energy and Emissions
A large portion of our operation costs are attributed to electricity usage in the manufacturing
process. This results in greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions. It is our belief that improving our
energy and emissions performance will lead to benefits for our organisation by maximising
usage of energy sources, reducing both consumption and cost.
We acknowledge our responsibility to reduce the environmental impacts of our business
operations and commit to minimise our environmental footprints through sustainable
practices and initiatives.
ASA places great emphasis on improving energy and emissions performance through energy
reduction initiatives, for example, increasing the usage of shared office spaces and increasing
the awareness among employees on the importance of environmental sustainability and the
part they can play by reducing their energy and emissions consumption as part of safety
protocols to battle the pandemic.
Regular monitoring of our energy consumption is conducted in areas such as equipment
manufacturing, heating, ventilation and air conditioning by implementing a robust monitoring
system. With implementation of energy monitoring initiatives, we have seen a reduction in
operational costs.

Energy intensity and GHG emissions intensity each declined by approximately 1.6%, which met the
target of maintaining the energy intensity within 10% from FY2019 levels. The decline in energy
consumption in FY2020 is mainly due to decreased usage at ASA's premises as part of safety protocols
to battle the pandemic as well as implementation of energy monitoring initiatives.
Targets
Maintain energy (electricity) intensity within 10% of FY2020's levels.

4.2.2. Water and Effluents
Management Approach
ASA is supportive of the international emphasis towards conserving water resources. ASA implements
holistic Water Usage Procedures to focus on reducing water usage especially with regards to operations
and production of our machinery products. Water consumption of our properties is tracked using the
water meters and usage is reported each quarter to the Board. Our Employment Handbook encourages
employees to integrate environmental considerations into their decision-making and activities which an
emphasis on minimising water usage.

The total water withdrawal for FY2020 was approximately 5.3% more than FY2019. The increase in
water usage in FY2020 was a result of enhanced hygiene procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic as
emphasis was put on washing hands thoroughly; sanitizing equipment and machinery, and ensuring
common touch-points like door handles are regularly disinfected.
Targets
Maintain water intensity within 10% of FY2020's levels.
12 | Sustainability Report

4.2.3.
Waste
At ASA, we consider waste management a key issue as we observe a growing interest from our
stakeholders and communities on how we manage waste generated from our business
operations. We are aware that companies that incorrectly and irresponsibly dispose waste are
being held accountable to their actions. More importantly, we recognize that any unregulated
methods of disposal could result in severe pollution that has ramifications on the community,
environment, and people's health.
Management Approach
ASA complies with all environmental regulations and goes beyond these legal statutes to better
manage hazardous and non-hazardous waste with an IS014001-certified environmental management
system for all our operations.
We ensure that our generated waste is processed through incineration, landfill or other disposal
methods that adhere to local rules and regulations.
At ASA, we prohibit burning of waste within our premises. All general waste and toxic industrial waste
are segregated and disposed of accordingly. We strive to recycle and possibly reuse most of the general
waste generated. We ensure collection and storage of all waste oils is secured and label drums at
designated areas to prevent any leaks or spills. All our waste oils and solid waste are sent to licensed
third party contractors for safe disposal.
Performance Data
In FY2020, there were zero incidents of non-compliance with laws and regulations concerning waste
management / disposal.
Targets
Achieve zero incidents of non-compliance with laws and regulations concerning
waste
management/disposal.
4.3.
Economic

Economic Performance
It is our belief that to deliver value for all our stakeholders, particularly our shareholders, we
have to focus on maintaining a strong financial position by carrying out our operations in a
responsible manner and building resilience throughout our business operations for long-term
sustainable growth.
Our financial performance for FY2020 can be found in the Financial Highlights section and
Appendix 2 - Audited Financial Statements of the Annual Report for FY2020, which was
released on 14 May 2021.

agreement in relation to the Company's proposed disposal of the entire issued and paid-up
share capital of each of Emerald Precision Engineering Sdn. Bhd., Yumei Technologies Sdn
Bhd., Yumei REIT Sdn. Bhd. and Pioneer Venture Pte. Ltd.; its results are presented separately
in the statement of comprehensive income as "Discontinued Operations".

4.4.1. Talent Attraction and Retention
At ASA, we value and respect every individual in the organisation and strive to have an
environment where all our employees feel like they are a part of the organisation. We are
committed to provide equal and fair employment opportunities as we believe diversity is the
key to growth and innovation in our business.
Management Approach
We believe in a transparent talent acquisition system. We offer our employees a competitive
compensation and a range of other benefits, such as health care coverage, parental leave and
retirement plans. We ensure that we recruit and retain the best talent. We also learn from the
employees who leave the company through the exit interviews where we gather feedback and
comments. It gives us some key insights on the areas for improvement in our recruitment and talent
retention system.

For FY2021, ASA will continue to target a turnover rate lower than the industry average of that year.
4.4.2. Diversity and Equal Opportunities
Management Approach
ASA is constantly striving to maintain a nurturing environment where all employees feel valued and
respected. Our human resource policies are holistic in nature and founded on the values of integrity
and empathy. Within our human resource policy, the whistleblowing process is well-established which
aids ASA to be transparent, promoting employee well-being and satisfaction.
The Group's Handbook and Terms and Conditions of Employment are aligned with these policies and
aim to provide employees an inclusive environment. We do not discriminate during our recruitment
process and we ensure that fair practices of hiring are adopted for all the deserving candidates,
including persons with disabilities, by offering remuneration as per market standards.
Additionally, diversity is a key focus of ASA Group and its importance is duly respected. We believe that
diversity is crucial for consistent innovation and aim to achieve diversity in terms of both age and
gender, as disclosed in the graphs below.

4.4.3. Training and Education
The key to ASA's success lies with its people, as such, we want to grow the right pool of talent
who are kept abreast of the latest industry developments, future-ready and will be able to
work together for the success of the organisation. We believe we can achieve that with the
right combination of on-site and off-site training and education. Due to COVID-19, we have
transitioned our training to online in order to meet safety distancing measures.
Management Approach
Our HR department assesses the current and future skills requirements for our business operations and
design learning and development programmes to meet these requirements. These programmes are
tailored to meet the needs of employees and enhance their personal and professional development.
Our training programmes in latest technology updates allow us to stay on the forefront of the industry.
There are special training programmes for the Senior Management to identify and groom promising
 individuals as part of our succession planning.
Performance Data
In FY2020, the total internal training hours provided to the staff was 30 hours, this equated to an
average of 0.3 hours of internal training catered to each of our employees. The decrease in training
hours is mainly due to COVID-19 safe-distancing measures and restrictions which affected the
conducting of on-site operational training, a major component of internal training provided by the
Company.
Targets
For FY2021, we will set our target to provide an average of 3 hours of internal training to our
employees.
17 | Sustainability Report

4.4.4. Occupational Health and Safety
Keeping our employees safe is our top priority as we endeavour to provide a safe working
environment for all staff.We remain committed to the health and safety and welfare of our
employees and strive to be in adherence to global and industrial standards and guidelines
while providing a safe and positive working environment to our employees.
Management Approach
ASA adopts safe work practices and have established standard operating procedures and conducts
emergency response training to ensure that the risk of accidents, injuries and exposure to health
hazards are minimised for all employees and contractors. In addition to this training, health and safety
training is conducted for employees to ensure that they are able to identify and manage common
hazards in the workplace in a safe manner. Employees and contractors are also required to follow the
ASA safety handbook which outlines standard safety practices and requirements.
On-site inspections are conducted to ensure that all equipment in ASA premises is safe for employees
to work with. Emergency plans and procedures are provided on signage for employees and ASA
building occupants to read in the case of an emergency. ASA seeks to identify any potential hazards and
monitor the effectiveness of health and safety risk control measures implemented. There is regular
maintenance and inspections of machinery utilised in the workplace.
With the emergence of cOVID-19, we have implemented a series of measures to maintain a safe
working environment for our employees. Some of the measures include, among other things, travel
restrictions to countries of operations, on-going communications between management and staff,
provision of three ply masks to all workers, and safe distancing among employees. Temperature-taking
was also conducted daily for each staff prior to admitting them into the workspace and each
department is equipped with a hand sanitiser station. Sanitisation at work areas is also conducted on a
regular basis to maintain a clean and safe environment for employees and visitors.
Performance Data
With zero reported workplace fatalities and zero major accidents among our employees in FY2020, we
have hereby achieved our target set for zero workplace fatalities/ injuries for FY2020.
Targets
Our FY2021 goal is to achieve zero workplace fatalities and injuries.
18 | Sustainability Report

4.4.5. Customer Health and Safety

4.4.9. Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is a key emerging threat in Singapore, as such, we strive to ensure our defences
against such breaches is sufficient in order to protect the Group's and our stakeholders'
interests.
Management Approach
Cybersecurity is handled by ASA's IT department which has routinely updated ASA's Active Antivirus
Server to protect all of ASA's clients' PCs and servers. They also conduct an annual health check for IT
Infrastructure including Servers and Devices (Firewall, VPN Device and Wireless Router). During this
session, the IT department will update the relevant firmware and related important patches. Such
updates and checks will reduce the risk of ASA being a target of cybercrime, and it will serve to enhance
the overall security in ASA's computers and network.
In ASA, users are made to reset their password annually to reduce the possibility of their account being
accessed by unauthorised people who may know their password.
Other controls put in place include data access rights to particular data folders in the data server only
being assigned to authorised users. ASA has a good and reputable firewall which is constantly updated
There is daily back-up in place to ensure that in any case of breaches such as ransomware, we can
easily reinstall the data from our backup tape. Normal employees have limited access to the server. In
any case of malware, there will be lower chances of disrupting the data and operating system of the
server. The company website is hosted by external party and not ASA's own server. This reduces the
possibility of hacking into ASA's office server. Lastly, ASA outsourced email services to Microsoft who
possesses an advanced scanning system to scan all emails for possible viruses and malware. This
reduced ASA's cybersecurity risk significantly as normally the first point of intrusion is through email.
Performance Data
There were zero incidents of cybersecurity breaches in FY2020.
Targets
There were no cybersecurity breaches in FY2020 and we continue to target for zero cybersecurity
breaches in FY2021.
