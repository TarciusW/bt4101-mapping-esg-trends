Conservation, Product Excellence and Corporate Social Responsibility

The Group has always held a high standard for environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues. In addition to 

complying with relevant laws and regulations on environmental protection matters, the Group is always mindful 

of conserving resources. For example, the design of the Group’s factory for the manufacturing of electronics and 

acoustic products conserves electricity consumption by allowing more sunlight to enter into the building. On a daily 

basis, employees are always reminded to minimise paper consumption by recycling used paper whenever possible.

The Group strives to develop innovative products that are both eco-friendly and cost-efficient in order to enrich 

the daily experience and improve the living standard of its customers as a whole. This is well demonstrated by 

the Group’s new KEF LSX wireless music system and the new R-series premium loudspeaker system, launched 

during the second half of FY2019, which were well received by the market and scooped a number of awards from 

prestigious music and gadget magazines.

GP Batteries has dedicated significant amount of resources and efforts to its research and development centre for 

the development of new products and introduction of advanced equipment. In order to meet the increasing market 

demand, GP Batteries has equipped itself with cost-effective automated systems that enhance productivity and 

quality control. GP Batteries’ quality management system and manufacturing process is data-driven and follows 

the Six Sigma philosophy for continuous improvement. Factors / parameters that could affect product quality are 

hence prevented by data automation. GP Batteries also possess world-class inspection equipment exclusive to the 

battery industry such as AAS (Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy), UV - VIS (UV - Visible Spectrometry) and EDXRF 

(Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence).

In promoting GP Batteries’ commitment in cleaner production to its suppliers, during FY2019, GP Batteries jointly 

organized “Greening the Supply Chain - Cleaner Production Seminar” with the “Cleaner Production Partnership 

Programme” in Shenzhen. The seminar promoted the best practices of reducing effluents and discharge of 

volatile organic compound from the industry, and GP Batteries’ requirements on factories and suppliers regarding 

IATF16949:2016 - the automotive sector quality management system. GP Batteries has minimised discharge of 

volatile organic compound according to regulatory requirement. The sharing targeted to achieve a win-win situation 

between environmental protection and economic benefits by enhancing the corporate social responsibility and 

environmental performance of GP Batteries’ supply chain, as well as lowering the production costs.

The Group cares about the community by organizing and participating in various social caring events. Driven by this 

fundamental value, the Group continues to provide resources in protecting environment, promote health and safety 

in the workplace, take an active role in shouldering corporate social responsibility and stay committed to providing 

the best products and services for its customers and the community.
