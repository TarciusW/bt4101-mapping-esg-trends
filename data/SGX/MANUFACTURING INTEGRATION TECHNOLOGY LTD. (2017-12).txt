Manufacturing Integration Technology Ltd

Sustainability Report 2017



Building	sustainable	businesses	deliver	long-term	shareholder	value	and	growth.	We	believe	that	a	truly	sustainable	

business	not	only	makes	good	economic	sense,	but	does	so	in	a	responsible	way	that	enhances	value	for	our	MIT	

brand,	business	and	stakeholders.	Our	Board	of	Directors	oversees	the	business	affairs	of	the	Group	and	is	collectively	

responsible	for	our	long-term	growth	and	success.	The	Board	remains	committed	to	advance	our	sustainability	efforts	

by	aligning	social	and	environmental	performance	with	the	business	and	financial	impact.

Manufacturing	 Integration	 Technology	 Ltd	 (hereafter	 referred	 to	 as“MIT”or	 the“Group”)	 presents	 our	 first	 annual	

Sustainability	Report	(the“SR	Report”)	which	covers	our	Group’s	operations	and	performance	from	1	January	2017	to	31	

December	2017	(the“reporting	period”).	

This	 Report	 examines	 the	 Group’s	 key	 sustainability	 issues,	 management	 approach,	 performance	 measures	 and	

outcomes.	It	is	prepared	in	accordance	with	the	GRI	(4G)	standards	:	Core	Option	and	is	guided	by	the	SGX	Sustainability	

Reporting	Guide.	Our	inaugural	Report	provides	information	on	the	Group’s	activities	primarily	in	Singapore.	Its	only	

other	overseas	operations	is	in	Shanghai,	China	where	we	operate	a	precision	machining	and	equipment	assembly	

facility.	Sustainability	performance	in	our	Shanghai	plant	will	be	integrated	into	our	subsequent	SRs	as	its	contributions	

to	the	restructured	new	core	business	become	more	significant,	especially	with	the	imminent	divestment	of	the	Group’s	

semiconductor	business	to	a	Chinese	private	equity	fund.	(Please	see	footnote	1	)	

The	formulation	of	a	more	complete	set	of	sustainability	targets	on	material	Environmental,	Social	and	Governance	

(ESG)	issues	still	requires	time	and	co-ordination	amongst	our	process	owners	and	we	hope	to	share	more	about	them	

in	our	subsequent	reports.	We	have	not	sought	external	assurance	for	this	reporting	period.

Our	Board	of	Directors	appoints	a	Sustainability	Steering	Committee	(SSC)	headed	by	our	Executive	Director,	Mr.	Lim	

Chin	Tong	and	supported	by	the	SSC	Corporate	team.	The	SSC’s	role	is	primarily	to	ensure	that	all	ESG	factors	and	

material	topics	which	are	likely	to	impact	the	Group	are	determined	and	evaluated	comprehesively	with	appropriate	

measures taken to address them. 

The	Board	holds	the	belief	that	achieving	superior	ESG	performance	must	be	an	ongoing	process	that	will	not	only	

enhance	the	Group’s	reputational	capital	but	will	also	help	drive	the	bottom	line	and	long-term	health	of	the	business.	

Our	Committee	had	worked	closely	with	all	relevant	stakeholders	in	our	ecosystem	to	gather	valuable	material	ESG	

factors	and	insights	for	our	sustainability	assessment.	We	are	pleased	that	several	new	policies	and	initiatives	had	been	

developed	from	these	discussions	to	form	part	of	our	overall	business	sustainability	strategy.

Sustainability Report 2017

2.1 Our Business

Manufacturing	Integration	Technology	Ltd	(MIT)	was	founded	in	1992	by	our	Chairman	and	Managing	Director,	Mr	Tony	

Kwong,	to	provide	industrial	automation	services	to	the	electronics	industry.	Over	a	span	of	25	years,	we	have	developed	

to	become	a	capital	goods	supplier	serving	the	semiconductor,	solar	and	contract	equipment	manufacturing	industries,	

not	just	in	Singapore,	but	across	Asia,	Europe	and	USA.	MIT	became	a	public	listed	Company	in	1999	with	its	shares	

traded on the Main Board of the Singapore Exchange Limited.   

Today,	we	operate	from	three	rented	facilities,	two	in	Ang	Mo	Kio	(Singapore)	and	the	other	in	Jiading	District	(Shanghai,	

China).	Our	corporate	headquarters	is	in	Singapore	together	with	our	R&amp;D	centre	for	semiconductor	equipment.	The	

semiconductor	equipment	are	manufactured	in	Singapore	while	the	more	hefty	solar	machines	are	assembled	in	our	

Jiading	facility.	In	recent	years,	we	have	deepened	our	local	CEM	capabilities	to	offer	built-to-print	manufacturing	services	

under	 CASEM	 (Asia)	 Pte	 Ltd	 and	 customized	 factory	 automation	 solutions	 provided	 by	 Automated	 Manufacturing	

Solutions	Pte	Ltd;	both	wholly-owned	subsidiaries	of	MIT.

2.2 Economic Performance, Financial Summary, Markets

We	closed	FY	2017	with	sales	of	S$65.929m	and	a	net	profit	of	S$6.006m.	The	external	environment	will	continue	to	

remain	uncertain	that	could	impinge	on	demand	growth	in	the	global	semiconductor	industry	especially	in	the	near-

term.	Going	forward,	we	should	see	stronger	performance	in	our	contract	equipment	manufacturing	(CEM)	business	as	

it	evolves	to	become	the	new	centrepiece	of	MIT's	core	business.

2.3 ISO9001 &amp; ISO14001 (since 2005)

We	have	been	ISO9001	(Quality	Management)	&amp;	ISO	14001	(Environment	Management)	certified	under	an	Integrated	

Management	 System	 (IMS)	 since	 2005.	 The	 primary	 focus	 of	 our	 IMS	 quality	 management	 is	 to	 meet	 customer	

requirements	and	to	strive	to	exceed	customer	expectations.	We	measure	our	success	by	our	ability	to	attract	and	retain	

the	confidence	of	customers	with	the	continuing	strong	support	of	our	business	and	supply	chain	partners.	Every	aspect	

of	our	internal	and	external	customer	interaction	provides	an	opportunity	for	continuous	improvement	thereby	creating	

greater	business	value	that	is	sustainable	over	the	longer-term.

As	 a	 testament	 to	 our	 product	 assurance,	 our	 semiconductor	 equipment	 are	 also	 certified	 to	 SEMI	 S2/S8	 and	 CE	

Mark	standards	to	ensure	a	global	standard	of	safety	that	are	demanded	from	our	equipment	buyers.	These	stringent	

international	 standards	 cover	 a	 wide	 range	 of	 safety,	 health	 and	 environmental	 protection	 provisions,	 including	

regulatory	requirements,	electrical,	mechanical,	fire,	chemical,	radiation,	noise	and	ergonomics	hazards	and	more.	This	

even	includes	warning	labels	and	instructions	on	the	proper	decommissioning	of	our	systems	from	active	status	or	the	

disposal	of	the	equipment	(or	its	parts)	at	the	end	of	its	productive	life.

4.1 Materiality Assessment

Our	materiality	assessment	process	for	FY2017	involved	the	SSC	team	in	consultation	with	our	major	stakeholders	to	

establish	ESG	issues	that	are	deemed	material	to	our	core	businesses	and	that	are	also	of	major	concern	to	the	wider	

community	(Fig.3).	This	is	to	ensure	that	our	strategies	and	resources	are	better	deployed	in	those	areas	that	matter	

most.	From	this	process,	16	attributes	were	identified	and	prioritized	(Fig.	4)	according	to	their	materiality	based	on		the

5. Environmental

5.1 Electricity and Water Conservation

On	environmental	management,	we	aim	to	comply	fully	with	all	legal	regulations	and	requirements	and	to	consume	

resources	responsibly,	focusing	on	minimizing	impacts	through	prevention	at	source,	reduction,	re-use	and	recycling	

initiatives.

Our	 energy	 and	 water	 efficiency	 efforts	 also	 apply	 to	 our	 daily	 office	 activities	 as	 we	 actively	 seek	 to	 reduce	 our	

consumption	of	energy	and	water	through	responsible	practices	such	as:

• 

Upgrading	of	equipment	and	lighting	that	are	more	energy	efficient

• 

Separation	of	paper/plastic/metal/general	waste	for	recycling

• 

Collection	and	recycling	of	office	paper	waste	by	authorized	contractors

• 

Automation	of	business	processes	e.g.	ERP,	E-leave	system	etc

• 

Inculcating	“Green	Office	and	Green	Home”	habits	such	as	switching	off	lights	and	electrical	appliances	when	

not	in	use,	practicing	air	conditioning	energy	saving	tips	and	even	encouraging	the	use	of	recyclable	bags	and	

reusable	cutlery	sets	or	containers	for	meal	takeaways

Our	most	direct	environmental	impact	stems	from	the	use	of	electricity.	Our	water	consumption	has	been	relatively	

minimal	over	the	years.	There	are	no	water	discharge	or	chemicals	used	in	our	equipment	manufacturing	processes.

Below	are	some	statistics	on	our	consumption	trend	and	records	of	the	last	three	years:

            Figure 7:  Collection and Recycling of Office paper waste

5.2 Work Place Air and Environment Certification

MIT	has	been	certified	ISO	14001	since	2005	to	provide	an	assurance	to	all	stakeholders	that	we	have	an	effective	

environmental	management	system	in	place	to	minimize	the	impact	our	operations	would	have	on	the	environment,	to	

ensure	that	all	applicable	laws	and	regulations	are	complied	with	and	to	continually	improve	on	our	business	processes	

to achieve higher level environmental standards that we have set for ourselves. 

To	ensure	a	safe	and	healthy	physical	work	environment	is	being	maintained,	indoor	air	quality	assessments	have	also	

been	conducted	within	our	premises	on	a	periodic	basis,	last	tested	on	14th	March	2017.

5.3 Laws and Regulations

In	the	area	of	WSHE,	we	comply	fully	with	the	relevant	laws	and	regulations	under	the	Fire	Safety	Act,	Workplace	

Safety	and	Health	Act,	Environment	Public	Health	Act	and	Environmental	Protection	and	Management	Act	that	regulates	

general	waste	collection,	the	control	of	trade	effluents,	ozone-depleting	substances	(ODS),	noise,	hazardous	substances,	

air	pollution	and	prevention	of	fire	and	others.	There	is	no	record	of	violation	against	any	of	the	regulations	during	the	

reporting	year.

5.4 Supply Chain

Our	main	suppliers	consist	of	original	equipment	manufacturers	(OEMs)	and	fabrication	houses.	OEMs	supply	us	with	

standard	parts	or	components	such	as	motors,	pneumatics,	lasers,	optics,	actuators,	sensors	etc	whereas	fabrication	

suppliers	 provide	 mainly	 machined	 parts,	 sheet-metal	 parts,	 structures	 and	 covers	 according	 to	 our	 engineering	

specifications.	We	seek	to	influence	our	supply	chain	partners	towards	sustainable	practices	by	outlining	our	expectations	

in	the	vendor	selection	process	as	well	as	through	our	annual	evaluation	of	their	performance.	To	remain	in	our	Approved	

Vendor	List	(AVL),	our	top	vendors	had	to	meet	a	host	of	performance	criteria	ranging	from	quality	assurance	and	service	

levels	as	well	as	adhering	to	best	practices	or	internationally	established	Code	of	Conduct	governing	human	rights,	

business	and	integrity,	and	safety,	health	and	environmental	standards.	We	aim	to	apply	these	standards	to	all	our	new	

major	suppliers/vendors.	It	is	our	belief	that	securing	a	pool	of	like-minded	suppliers	that	share	our	commitment	to	

sustainability	will	mitigate	risks	to	our	operations	and	reputation.	We	are	also	broadening	our	vendor	base	for	alternative	

parts	supply	to	improve	demand	planning,	cost	competitiveness	and	ensure	certainty	of	supply.	We	therefore	aim	to	

maintain	at	least	one	primary	and	one	secondary	supply	source	for	critical	parts	and	long	lead	items	wherever	possible.

5.5 International Environment Calendar

We	 promote	 international	 Environmental	 Days	 as	 special	 days	 to	 raise	 the	 awareness	 of	 environmental	 issues	 and	

environmental	protection.	We	mark	these	environmental	days	to	disseminate	information,	educate	about	risks	in	our	

ecosystem,	and	to	encourage	participation	on	“Car	free	days”,	observing	“Earth	Hour/	Day”	,”World	Biological	Diversity	

Day”	and	even	“World	Animal	Day”,	just	to	name	a	few.				

Our	next	approach	beyond	awareness	will	be	to	encourage	and	measure	the	participation	level	of	our	staff	in	the	various	

activities	associated	with	these	global	initiatives	so	that	these	values	can	be	imbibed	into	them	at	a	personal	level	and	

also	as	part	of	our	corporate	DNA.

6. Social

MIT	 is	 committed	 to	 carrying	 out	 its	 business	 mission	

efficiently	,	effectively	and	responsibly	with	integrity	and	

respect	 for	 the	 law,	 the	 environment	 and	 well-being	 of	

employees and the community at large. Our commitment 

to	maintain	the	highest	standards	of	business	ethics	and	

to	continually	improve	our	Corporate	Social	Responsibility	

practices	 is	 paramount.	 We	 expect	 the	 same	 level	 of	

commitment from every employee and our partners in the 

conduct	of	their	daily	work	affairs	and	in	their	relationship	

with all our major stakeholders.

Our Employees

6.1 Fair Employment Practices

MIT	adheres	to	the	philosophy	espoused	in	the	Tripartite	

Guidelines	on	Fair	Employment	and	other	best	HR	practices	

that	we	had	publicly	pledged	with	Tripartite	Alliance	for	

Fair	and	Progressive	Employment	Practices	(or	TAFEP).

We	also	subscribe	to	the	Responsible	Business	Alliance	Code	

of	 Conduct	 (formerly	 the	 Electronic	 Industry	 Citizenship	

Coalition)	to	ensure	that	our	working	conditions	are	safe,	

that workers are treated with respect and dignity and that 

our	business	operations	are	environmentally	responsible	

and conducted ethically.  

MIT	endeavors	to	uphold	the	spirit	of	these	best	practices	

and	 to	 conform	 to	 (and	 continually	 improve	 on)	 its	

standards	 in	 accordance	 with	 acceptable	 management	

practices	within	the	jurisdiction	of	the	local	laws	in	which	

we	operate.	Some	of	the	key	principles	are	to:

• 

Recruit, select, promote, reward and train employees 

on	the	basis	of	merit	such	as	skills,	experience	and	

ability,	 regardless	 of	 race	 color,	 age,	 gender,	 sexual	

orientation,	 ethnicity,	 national	 origin,	 disability,	

pregnancy,	

religion,	

political	

affiliation,	

union	

membership	or	marital	status

• 

Treat employees fairly and with respect and implement 

progressive	human	resource	practices

• 

Embrace	the	diversity	of	all	members	within	the	MIT	

family

• 

Provide	 employees	 with	 equal	 opportunities	 for	

training	 and	 development	 based	 on	 their	 individual	

needs	to	help	them	achieve	their	fullest	potential

• 

Promote and provide a harassment free environment

• 

Reward	 employees	 fairly	 based	 on	 their	 ability,	

performance,	contributions	and	experience

• 

Respect	for	privacy	and	protect	personal	information

Social

• 

Provide	 transparency	 in	 and	 accountability	 for	 the	

Group’s	performance	and	practices

• 

Abide	by	local	regulations	including	Safety.	Health	and	

Environmental laws

6.2 Training and Education

We	are	focused	on	developing	our	people	and	getting	the	

very	best	from	our	staff	whilst	helping	them	to	achieve	

their	individual	career	aspirations.	We	want	our	employees	

to	 feel	 that	 they	 are	 contributing	 to	 our	 purpose	 and	

believe	the	organization	supports	them	in	this	endeavour.	

MIT	operates	in	a	technology	space	where	we	continually	

invest	on	R&amp;D.	Similarly,	we	believe	that	it	is	in	our	best	

interest to invest in the careers of our employees through 

continuous	learning.	We	do	this	by	investing	in	structured	

On-Job-Training,	 providing	 Core	 Skills	 Training	 (at	 both	

individual	 and	 group	 levels),	 as	 well	 as	 exposing	 them	

to	 development	 opportunities	 where	 they	 can	 get	 to	

undertake stretched projects or assignments, and even to 

lead them.

6.3 Compensation and Rewards

Our	compensation	policy	is	intended	to	be	well-balanced,	

competitive,	 performance	 based	 and	 aligned	 with	 the	

achievements of each employee. While the approach 

reflects	 an	 emphasis	 on	 pay-for-performance,	 it	 is	 also	

designed	to	attract,	motivate	and	retain	high	performing	

and	 high	 potential	 employees.	 Employees	 are	 also	

incentivized	through	annual	bonus	that	are	tied	to	financial	

and	non-financial	metrics	as	well	as	stock-option	awards	

for	key	staff	to	enable	them	to	benefit	from	the	growth	of	

the	Group.

6. Social (cont'd)

6.3 Compensation and Rewards (cont'd)

In	addition,	a	range	of	statutory	and	non-statutory	staff	

benefits	are	offered	to	employees	including	medical	and	

dental	 benefits,	 term	 life,	 personal	 accident	 plans,	 long	

service awards, paternity, maternity and other leave 

benefits	 etc.	 that	 we	 peg	 to	 industry	 practices.	 Beyond	

this,	 MIT	 provides	 paid-leave	 for	 employees	 attending	

work-related	 training	 courses	 making	 use	 of	 their	 own	

SkillFuture credits.

We	 believe	 it	 is	 also	 important	 to	 recognize	 the	 right	

behavior	 and	 reward	 them	 (either	 individually	 or	

groups)	financially	and	by	peer	to	peer	recognition.	Our	

“Spontaneous	Award”	program	has	worked	well	to	ensure	

that	exceptional	efforts	performed	by	employee(s)	above	

and	beyond	the	normal	course	of	duty	do	not	go	unnoticed	

but	 are	 positively	 reinforced	 through	 these	 on-the-spot	

rewards.

6.4 Performance Management &amp; Engagement 

MIT	 is	 committed	 to	 carry	 out	 an	 objective	 and	 fair	

performance	 management	 system	 to	 align	 the	 Group’s	

objectives	 with	 individual	 performance,	 reward	 results	

and to support people development in the process.  Even 

though the formal PA assessment is conducted once a 

year,	managers	and	their	staff	are	encouraged	to	review	

and	 discuss	 performance	 issues	 on	 an	 ongoing	 basis.	

Performance Improvement plans are also developed for 

under-performing	employees.

Apart	from	one-on-one	dialogues	with	employees,	we	also	

engage	them	through	other	media	such	as	Open-Comm	

meetings	with	senior	staff,	regular	department	briefings,	

corporate	updates	through	e-platforms	(emails,	intranet)	

and even during corporate social events. 

Employee	 feedback	 is	 also	 encouraged	 to	 help	 MIT	

understand what makes them more engaged and to 

address real and latent disengagement risks in the 

process.	 Such	 feedback	 channels	 are	 not	 confined	 to	

engagement	surveys	but	will	also	include	all	forms	of	open	

communications	 and	 focused	 groups	 (both	 formal	 and	

informal).

6.5 Safety, Health and overall well being, Employee 

Benefits

Our	 WSHE	 Committee	 includes	 representation	 from	

the	various	business	units	to	help	us	in	our	endeavor	to	

ensure	that	the	workplace	continues	to	remain	free	from	

industrial	hazards	and	accidents.	

Social

Apart	 from	 monthly	 meetings	 and	 inspections,	 the	

Committee	 for	 the	 reporting	 year	 had	 been	 very	 much	

involved	 in	 other	 activities	 such	 as	 promoting	 WSHE	

awareness, reviewing our safety risk management 

framework,	 undergoing	 training	 in	 first	 aid	 (and	 AED),	

exercising	 vigilance	 over	 dengue	 and	 ZIKA	 outbreaks,	

and	 seeing	 to	 the	 conduct	 of	 emergency	 evacuation	

exercises.	One	of	the	many	other	recommendations	that	

had	been	carried	out	was	also	to	ensure	that	workplace	

safety	 policies	 and	 manufacturing	 work	 instructions	

are documented in at least two major languages for the 

benefit	of	our	foreign	workers.

in 2015 involved a minor ankle injury sustained outside of 

the	office	but	in	connection	with	employment	requiring	a	

period	of	hospitalization	leave.

6.6 Leadership development for succession planning

Our	Board	of	Directors	through	its	Nominating	Committee	

has	oversight	of	Senior	Management	(including	the	CEO)	

talent and succession plans which is reviewed annually. 

Ensuring	a	pipeline	of	effective	leaders	for	the	Group	who	

will	 be	 ready	 and	 able	 to	 assume	 greater	 responsibility	

when	 critical	 positions	 become	 available	 is	 still	 work	 in	

progress	for	the	Board	and	HR.

6.7 Work Force characteristics and Diversity

We view the diversity of our people as a source of strength. 

We seek to create an inclusive work environment that 

extends	beyond	just	age	and	gender	differences	to	include	

drawing on the range of cultural dimensions represented 

by	the	different	nationalities	and	backgrounds.

7.2 Ethics and Integrity

MIT's	Code	of	Conduct	establishes	an	ethical	framework	

for	business	practices	and	conduct	to	which	all	employees	

are	required	to	adhere	to	without	exceptions.	Employees	

are expected to exercise good judgment, prudence 

and	 with	 clarity	 of	 intention	 and	 to	 seek	 to	 avoid	 even	

the	 appearance	 of	 any	 improper	 behavior	 in	 their	 daily	

interactions	 with	 their	 colleagues,	 customers,	 suppliers,	

business	 associates	 and	 with	 the	 general	 public.	 MIT	

expects	the	same	high	standards	of	business	ethics	and	

integrity	to	be	upheld	by	our	agents	or	partners	and	those	

that	it	does	business	with.

MIT's	Code	of	Conduct	covers	ethical	issues	and	guidance	

concerning:

• Outside employment and Personal Interest

•	 Conflict	of	interest

•	 Compliance	with	laws,	rules	and	regulations

•	 Insider	Trading	prohibitions

•	 Disclosure	requirements	and	Accuracy	of	records

•	 Investor	Relations	and	Business	Communications

• Social Media

•	 Discrimination	and	Harassment,	and	Privacy

• Workplace Violence

•	 Proper	Use	and	Protection	of	Assets

•	 Competition	and	Fair	Dealing

•	 Business	Integrity	and	No	improper	Advantage

•	 Bribery	and	Corruption	(Entertainment	,	Gifts	and	

Gratuities)

•	 Purchasing	Practices	&amp;	Equal	Business	Opportunity

• Copyright and Licensing Compliance

•	 Confidential	 Information/Intellectual	 Property	

Protection

Awareness	is	created	from	the	very	first	day	of	employment	

by	way	of	basic	ethics	training	at	the	time	of	on-boarding.	

Masterclasses	on	Business	Ethics	for	senior	staff	are	also	

being	conducted	periodically.	As	part	of	our	internal	audit	

compliance	 practices,	 all	 staff	 are	 required	 to	 sign	 an	

acknowledgement of their compliance to the Code and to 

declare	any	existing	or	potential	conflict	of	interest	on	an	

annual	basis.	There	are	furthermore	procedures	to	ensure	

that	all	transactions	with	interested	parties	are	reported	

timely	 to	 the	 Audit	 Committee	 whilst	 ascertaining	 that	

transactions	are	being	conducted	on	an	arms-length	basis	

and are not deemed prejudicial to the interests of the 

Group	or	its	shareholders.	

In	dealing	with	MIT’s	securities,	our	Directors	and	Officers	

are	 also	 expected	 to	 strictly	 abide	 by	 internal	 Code	 of	

Best	 Practices	 on	 Securities	 Transaction	 established	 in	

compliance	 with	 SGX	 listing	 rule	 1207(19)	 to	 ensure	

that	 they	 do	 not	 run	 afoul	 of	 securities	 regulations	

especially	 on	 insider-trading.	 The	 Securities	 Transaction	

Code	 furthermore	 enables	 MIT	 to	 monitor	 such	 shares	

transactions	 by	 requiring	 them	 to	 report	 within	 two	 (2)	

business	 days	 whenever	 they	 deal	 in	 its	 securities.	 To-

date,	there	has	been	no	incident	of	corruption	(alleged	or	

otherwise)	and	no	legal	cases	brought	against	the	Group	

or	our	employees	by	the	authorities.

7.3 Whistle-Blowing Policy

Bribery	 or	 corruption	 or	 ethical	 violations	 in	 any	 form	

will	 not	 be	 tolerated	 in	 any	 circumstances	 and	 any	

incident	report	will	be	looked	into	very	seriously.	We	have	

established	 a	 direct	 whistle	 blowing	 channel	 that	 goes	

right	up	to	the	attention	of	the	Audit	Committee	members	

(comprising	 Independent	 Directors)	 who	 will	 deal	 with	

these	 matters	 or	 any	 other	 serious	 acts	 of	 business	

impropriety.	 Whistle-blowers	 are	 assured	 of	 anonymity,	

confidentiality	and	non-retaliation.	We	are	glad	to	report	

that	since	2008	when	our	whistle-blowing	policy	was	first	

introduced,	there	has	been	no	official	complaint	or	case	

lodged	with	the	Committee.

7.4 Risk Management

We	have	an	Enterprise	Risk	Management	(ERM)	Committee	

in	place,	reporting	to	the	Audit	Committee	of	the	Board.	

The	 ERM	 is	 responsible	 for	 identifying	 operational,	

compliance	and	financial	risks	areas	affecting	the	Group	

and	 implementing	 measures	 to	 mitigate	 these	 risks.	 A	

2-page	summary	of	our	risk	management	report	has	been	

highlighted	 in	 our	 Annual	 Report	 2017.	 By	 identifying	

and	managing	these	risks	the	Group	will	be	able	to	take	

a	balanced	approach	to	managing	risks	and	rewards	and	

to	make	more	informed	decisions	to	better	protect	and	

safeguard the interests of our stakeholders.
