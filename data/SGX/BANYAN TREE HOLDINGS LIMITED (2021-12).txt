Having weathered two years of the COVID storm we now 

see the light at the end of the tunnel. While there may yet be 

uncertainty and setbacks, we see a resilient and sustainable 

future, with purposeful travel embracing nature and wellness. 

We emerge a different business, having introduced three new 

wellbeing oriented brands, and this journey has strengthened 

our core wellbeing and environmental consciousness. 

We see a global sustainable movement is afoot, but this 

is not new to us. Sustainability is a need not a luxury, and 

has been a core Banyan Tree value since our founding 27 

years ago. This is our 16th sustainability report, and the 

last in our current materiality cycle as we reflect on our 

progress and begin to chart a new path, addressing ongoing 

and emerging challenges post-COVID. All our efforts up 

to this point provide a platform for future possibilities. 

The next global challenge is already upon us, and COP26 

and the recent IPCC report paint a daunting picture of 

climate change and reinforce the collective action required. 

Emission reductions during global lockdowns show what 

we need to sustain to support the planet, and we shall 

prepare a TCFD aligned roadmap for decarbonisation. As 

a founding member and signatory of the United Nations 

Global Compact in Singapore, our efforts extend beyond 

the precautionary approach, and we have incorporated 

the new SGX reporting metrics a year in advance as we 

transition to new materiality and a new world of business. 

Supported by an engaged Board of Directors, passionate 

associates, and stakeholder alliances, collective action 

can tackle what might at first appear insurmountable. 

Disciplined in our behaviour, transparent and 

accountable for our efforts, we accept each challenge 

to imagine new ways for business to better society.

The world continues to be uncertain and disruptive. There 

is no room to talk about a post-COVID era, because we 

will continue to encounter various kinds of threats, if not 

from mutated virus, it will be human conflict. We cannot 

look to the past to recapture what we once had, but rather 

we must look forward, to discover and generate new 

ideas and business practices to create new opportunities 

for growth and development. We re-norm, re-design, re-

structure, in view of the threats, and despite them. This 

adaptive agility in crafting our imagination to experiment 

with new possibilities is key to corporate sustainability.

In the midst of struggling with isolation and an uncertain 

future in the travel industry, we did not paralyse and 

close up our minds. We have emphasised many more 

hours of learning and development through Zoom and 

Teams, to create shared purpose, connections and unity. 

We have developed eight corporate cultures to foster 

purpose-based business and personal development, by 

equipping associates with the necessary tools to integrate 

the needs of work, home, community and self.  

We believe wellbeing is not only about enjoying a healthy 

physical condition, it is about being well in the way we 

think, feel and act that are aligned with organisational 

and personal goals. The hours we had spent during the 

COVID months in bringing our associates together to learn 

from one another, had been powerful in enhancing their 

understanding  in what they do, for what purpose, and how. 

More importantly, they know they were not alone. I recall 

an uplifting quote that the empire of the future is the empire 

of the mind. Indeed, our greatest resilience is in nurturing 

well prepared minds, not afraid of change, constantly 

replenished by new people, experiences and ideas.

After awareness comes acceptance, and now action. Now is 

the time to discover meaning and relevance in a time when 

less is more: less exploitation, less excess, less waste; more 

care, more sharing and more conservations at all levels. 

Our sustainability is about creating workplace conditions in 

promoting focus, creative effort, purpose and collaboration; and 

about how we walk the talk to act as stewards of livelihood, 

biodiversity and culture. The journey is what matters, and we 

should all aim to live each day meaningfully and purposefully.

The Board of Directors manage for long-term sustainable value creation for all stakeholders. Sustainability remains a key 

component of our corporate purpose; the Board of Directors consider sustainability issues as part of the company’s strategic 

formulation, approved the selection of the material Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors and the Group’s 

strategic approach to mitigating impact, and monitor progress towards set targets presented in this Report. The Directors 

acknowledge ownership starts with the Board, with senior management ensuring the sustainability mission is embraced 

and implemented by all in the Banyan Tree family. The following highlights showcase our progress over the course of this 

five-year materiality cycle (or as stated if otherwise), with annual progress reported within each relevant section.

Highlights of Our Journey



Tourism has significant generative 

power with one in ten jobs globally 

and the livelihoods of millions more 

depending on the restart of tourism 

for recovery and growth. Out of crisis 

comes opportunity: to discover better 

ways to do business, to mitigate negative 

impact on lives and generate sustainable, 

carbon neutral and resilient tourism 

with people at the centre. A purposeful, 

sustained and generative recovery is 

essential to tackle unprecedented global 

inequality and threats to nature, create 

shared value for society and support 

the achievement of the United Nations 

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

independent, multi-brand hospitality groups. The 

Group’s diversified portfolio of hotels, resorts, 

spas, galleries, golf and residences is centred on an 

ecosystem of 10 global brands including the award-

winning Banyan Tree, Angsana, Cassia, Dhawa and 

Laguna. In 2021, new brands Folio, Garrya and Homm 

were added along with new Banyan Tree brand 

extensions, Banyan Tree Escape and Banyan Tree Veya. 

Detailed breakdowns of operations (pages 10 to 

21), markets served (pages 24 to 39), revenue and 

finance (pages 71 to 76) can be found in our Annual 

Report (investor.banyantree.com). Headquartered 

in Singapore, we have a global presence including 

ownership or management interest in:

The global pandemic continued to impact travel 

and tourism in 2021. We continued to protect 

and support associate health and wellbeing (page 

29), and invested in learning and development 

(page 30) to create connections and shared 

purpose during this challenging time.

To date, our efforts have been acknowledged 

by 102 sustainability awards, with 16 in 2021, 

most notably the Singapore Apex Corporate 

Sustainability Award (Sustainable Business), 

Sustainable Business Award (Community) and 

ASEAN Business Award (Skills Development).

Established in 1994, Banyan Tree Group was founded 

with the core value of driving long-term sustainable 

development, conceptualised by our “Brand for Good” 

framework and a carefully constructed motto of 

“Embracing the Environment, Empowering People”. 

Our mission is to build globally recognised brands that 

create exceptional experiences for our guests, instil 

pride and integrity in our associates, and enhance 

both the physical and human environment in which 

we operate. In doing so, we deliver attractive returns 

to our shareholders, and prove that doing good can 

be good business. It is a strategic priority to protect 

what is ours and evangelise our philosophy to our 

stakeholders as a business value proposition. 

Operating in diverse locations, our approach of 

sustainable stewardship for people, planet and 

prosperity, employs an integrated and participatory 

approach to minimise impact, while safeguarding 

and enhancing the human and physical environment 

for present and future generations. A balanced 

and purposeful business approach supports 

long-term value creation across our global 

network of properties, products and brands.  

Crisis provides an opportunity to rediscover purpose, 

reinforce the values on which Banyan Tree Group 

was founded, and support the generation of human, 

social, natural and financial capital. We go beyond the 

precautionary principle, to harmonise our operations 

with nature and cultivate enduring partnerships with 

our stakeholders. This report presents and evaluates 

the challenges and progress of our journey in 2021, 

and establishes our future focus and ambition.

“Stay for Good” embeds core sustainable and stewardship 

values in operations and guest experience, promoting

OVERVIEW

The global pandemic has disrupted livelihoods and 

business, instigating our new materiality review to ensure 

we address the most current and pressing impacts to 

stakeholders from our business operations. Presently there 

are no hospitality sector-specific reporting standards, so we 

updated our 2017 review of published academic literature, 

as well as competitor and industry reports to incorporate 

emerging material risks. Following consolidation, executive 

management reviewed and approved for prioritisation a 

shortlist of 14 existing and emerging environmental, social and 

governance (ESG) material risks pertinent to our business. 

The severity and likelihood of material risk impacts were rated 

following GRI (2021) guidance, via an online survey, with 659 

senior and executive management respondents across Banyan 

Tree Group worldwide. Material topics were evaluated at the 

residual level, considering the adequacy and effectiveness of 

existing controls and progress, and comparing the impact of 

each topic from our business against other topics rather than 

within a global context that may not be within our control. 

External stakeholder opinions will be incorporated in 2022 

to define impact scope and develop mitigation strategies 

for the four greatest material risks from our business, (waste, 

biodiversity, water scarcity, and climate change), and we 

include diversity, equality and inclusion, and health and 

wellbeing due to alignment with our core values. The exclusion 

of topics we previously reported on (e.g. leadership, supply 

chain) reflects progress made, while new topics such as water 

scarcity have emerged as increasingly important (see matrix). 

This report is the last for our current material topics. For each 

topic, we present the scope and importance, our management 

approach, commitments, responsibilities, targets and progress. 

Further details on the alignment, selection, description and 

progress for each material topic can be found online*. 

In 2022, we shall establish baselines and triple-horizon 

targets for our new framework against which we will 

track progress until 2030, aligned with the SDGs and new 

Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX) reporting frameworks. We 

will periodically review our materiality assessment to ensure 

it addresses current stakeholder needs to deliver on our 

stewardship efforts through “Embracing the Environment, 

Empowering People” and promoting responsible travel.

OUR APPROACH

Stakeholder Engagement

Generation of sustained partnerships supports progress towards 

the SDGs, and our business is a vessel to communicate, engage 

and bring together stakeholders to create shared value. Regular, 

transparent and two-way communication builds trust and is 

central to our stakeholder-inclusive approach to business.

We define our stakeholders as groups that our business has 

significant impact on, and those with a vested interest in our 

operations. We embrace diversity of stakeholders and the 

communication channels, to not just anticipate stakeholder 

needs, but to engage and give stakeholders a platform to voice 

concerns and needs. Stakeholders and their issues of interest, 

and the engagement platforms we use are outlined in the table. 

In 2021, we continued to evangelise our sustainability 

philosophy within travel and tourism, our supply chain (page 

39) and employ a cross-sector collaborative approach to 

engage individuals, businesses, NGOs, public and private 

institutions worldwide. The pandemic continued to challenge 

in-person engagement and public gatherings, so we used 

this opportunity to strengthen online engagement with our 

associates through our new internal mobile application “BT 

Connect”, and held an online pledge campaign for Earth Day. 

Externally, we supported youth awareness online through the 

UNGC Singapore platform, and added our voice and action 

to a growing sustainable travel movement by signing the 

UNSECO Sustainable Travel Pledge with Expedia Group. 

We grew our partnership network to tackle global challenges 

and threats, during a period of restricted movement, teaming 

up Earth Day Network to combat climate change (page 15), 

and issuing funding to eight NGOs in our inaugural round 

of Greater Good Grants (pages 13, 18 to 25). As we engage 

through these platforms, we deepen our partnerships and 

continue to develop our network for collective action for good.

OUR APPROACH

Financial  

Sustainability

Tourism will play an important role in the recovery of 

national economies and global trade, with over 100 million 

livelihoods worldwide depending on the restart of tourism 

for recovery and growth. The United Nations World 

Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) called for diversification 

of tourism in 2022 and beyond, to boost job creation 

and protect natural resources and cultural heritage. 

The announcement of three new brands and two Banyan 

Tree brand extensions, along with the strengthening 

of our sustainability and wellbeing offerings, builds on 

27 years of experience and commitment to sustainable 

development, re-establishing our purpose and positioning 

the Group for business in a next normal. The financial 

capital summary herein provides transparency as a core 

pillar of sustainability; a more detailed review can be found 

in the annual report (pages 26 to 29). Financial sustainability 

provides the fuel for the business as a vehicle “for good”, 

creating shared value for people and the planet.

Our Group’s revenue includes Hotel Investments, Branded 

Residences and Extended Stay, and Fee-based business. As 

at 31 December 2021, revenue from our Hotel Investments 

was contributed by Thailand (37%), Indian Ocean (62%) 

and Others (1%). Branded Residences and Extended Stay 

consist of sales of Hotel Residences, Laguna residences and 

Extended Stay and Development Site Sales. Our fee-based 

business comprises Hotel, Fund and Club management, 

Spa and Gallery Operations, Design and other services.

OUR APPROACH

Reporting Frameworks

Report Scope 

Businesses can play an important role in the successful 

resolution of some of the most pressing contemporary 

global challenges for people and the planet. Tourism has 

considerable potential to generate sustainable development, 

support livelihoods and nurture resilient environments 

on which it depends, particularly in Least Developed 

Countries and Small Island Developing States where 

tourism accounts for up to 80% of domestic GDP. 

We employ multiple frameworks for the strategic 

management of our material risks and to support transparent, 

standardised and comparable communication of our 

economic, environmental and social impacts, as well as 

contribution towards sustainable development:

This is Banyan Tree Group’s 16th annual sustainability 

report. This Report presents data for the calendar 

year as of 31st December 2021, and focuses on hotel, 

resort, spa and gallery operations owned or managed 

by Banyan Tree Group’s headquarters in Singapore.

OUR ENVIRONMENT

Climate Change

Climate change presents one of the greatest global 

challenges of our time and COP26 highlighted the critical 

point at which we stand, and the need for greater climate 

transparency and a net-zero economy. Travel and tourism 

contributes to, and is impacted by, climate change. At the 

same time, a climate-friendly travel and tourism industry 

can be a catalyst for support in destinations at risk. 

Research commissioned by the International Tourism 

Partnership (ITP, 2018) indicated the global hotel industry 

needs to reduce absolute carbon emissions by 66% by 

2030 and 90% by 2050 to stay within a 2oC climate 

change scenario. Our approach towards decarbonisation 

and climate change mitigation includes improvements 

in energy efficiency, awareness and behavioural change 

programmes, increasing the prevalence of renewable 

energy, and spearheading greening projects. We embed 

climate change and related issues in our business strategy, 

engage across the value chain, and promote responsible 

travel through a participatory stakeholder approach. 

Restricted traveller movements and temporary operational 

closures continued to keep Group total resource use (page 

18) and waste production (page 19) lower than pre-pandemic 

levels. However, the return of international travel and planned 

business growth requires a deep understanding of how to 

decarbonise and achieve net-zero by 2050. Therefore, in 2021 

we mapped our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, with energy audits 

planned for older properties, and a group-wide equipment 

inventory to guide efficiency improvements in 2022. Solar 

panels were installed at Laguna Phuket Kindergarten to replace 

half their power supply, and Power Purchase Agreements are 

being explored across the Group to target eligible properties 

based on emissions, location and design. Working with 

EarthCheck, we calculated science-based targets, accounting 

for business growth to 2050 under multiple scenarios 

using the Sectoral Decarbonisation Approach to better 

understand our emission trajectory and reduction needs.

As climate change remains a key material risk to stakeholders 

and business, we are prioritising the strategic development 

and integration of a decarbonisation strategy aligned with 

the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC, 2021) 

industry guidance and the Task Force on Climate-Related 

Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework in 2022, which 

we will communicate in our next Sustainability Report.

Earth Hour

Each year we give a voice to climate change awareness by 

joining the global Earth Hour movement to turn off non-

essential lights for one hour at our properties. Forty properties 

participated in 2021, saving 6,761 kWh of electricity in a 

single hour: equivalent to 18 months’ worth of energy to 

power a four-room public housing unit in Singapore (ema.

gov.sg). Our Maldives properties continue to extend this 

initiative to each full moon, saving an additional 844 kWh 

in 2021. Since 2017, individual engagement has increased 

by 362% with 42,444 participants, and our Group has 

saved 21,921 kWh, equivalent to 8.9 tonnes of CO2.

Biodiversity and ecosystem goods 

and services support all life on 

earth, and the interconnectedness 

between the environment and 

people highlighted by the ongoing 

pandemic requires a coordinated and 

collaborative approach to conserve, 

manage and restore natural systems. 

Our business is intrinsically dependent on 

natural heritage, with biodiverse habitats 

an attraction requiring our careful 

stewardship. We employ a science-

based approach to detect and track 

change, implement efficient operations 

and resource conservation initiatives to 

mitigate impact, deploy education and 

awareness programmes to support action, 

and curate partnerships to access domain 

expertise needed to conserve and restore 

sensitive ecosystems and threatened 

species. This holistic approach extends 

beyond traditional hospitality business 

operations to support climate action and 

the Sustainable Development Goals.

Resource Use 

and Waste 

Conservation of resources and waste reductions go 

beyond operational efficiency, to support climate 

change action and promote healthy communities and 

environments. The principles of reduce, reuse and recycle 

have been implemented at all properties, and resources 

are conserved through improved efficiency, adoption of 

new practices or technology, and awareness programmes 

to encourage behavioural change and best practice. 

Our KPIs are a 5% annual reduction in energy, emissions, 

water and waste at each property, and the implementation 

of at least one resource conservation initiative per 

property each year. Emission reductions focus on 

Scope 1 and 2 as they remain within our control.

A strategic partnership with EarthCheck* since 2010 

provides assurance, benchmarking and certification, 

with offsite data validation continuing in 2021 due to the 

pandemic preventing onsite audits. Energy and water use 

by properties not registered with EarthCheck were verified 

from financial documentation. Waste could not be verified 

and are not included, but we will standardise waste and 

recycling tracking for all properties in 2022. Calculations 

of percent water and waste recycled for the Group were 

made on absolute values rather than averaged across 

properties. Data presented may exhibit minor variance 

from previous reports due to auditing verification. 

Total resource use is reported as the sum of all hotels, resorts, 

offices and golf courses. Resource intensity for hotels and 

resorts is presented per occupied room (POR) to allow 

comparison at different occupancies. Travel restrictions 

continued to reduce occupancies, resulting in higher resource 

intensity values due to public area baseloads. Consequently, 

no insightful comparisons were possible with regional industry 

average or best practice data provided by EarthCheck.

Greening Communities

Since 2007, our Greening Communities programme has 

planted 532,494 trees in local communities to raise awareness 

of climate change, sequestering approximately 183,568 

tonnes of carbon (based on 40 kg of carbon sequestered 

per tree per year, and assuming 100% survival).

In 2021, we planted 9,306 trees, despite challenges during 

the ongoing pandemic, including 5,150 trees planted in 

Mexico’s Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve as part of a 

partnership with EARTHDAY.ORG’s The Canopy Project. 

During a month-long campaign, with strong support from 

guests, each booking included a US$1 donation, which we 

dollar-matched to raise US$10,300 for The Canopy Project. 

Our contribution enabled The Canopy Project to plant 

30,000 trees in Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve with the 

support of 2,000 people from 50 communities, to counter 

climate change, produce food and create bird habitats.

Community conservation to restore and 

protect Borneo’s rainforests

Borneo’s vast peatland forests are home to the largest remaining orangutan 

populations, provide economic and social benefits for indigenous communities, 

and are major global carbon stores. Unfortunately, they are being destroyed 

by annual fires resulting from decades of poor land management. 

In 2021, four new community nurseries were established to empower rural 

communities to grow native seedlings for reforestation, with the necessary 

resources and training provided. Over 47,000 seedlings were purchased 

from the nurseries, and planted in previously-burnt regions of the Sebangau 

National Park in order to regrow the forest, expand the area of wildlife 

habitat, and reduce risk of future fires. These planted seedlings are monitored 

consistently, with high rates of planting success and seedling survival to date. 

At the same time, in spite of challenges brought on by COVID-19 

restrictions, online resources were used to deliver environmental 

education and raise awareness in schools and clubs.

Water and Waste  

Total annual potable water use increased by 6% to 4.53 

billion litres and use POR increased by 2.5%, due to new 

and reopened operations. However, total water use in 2021 

was 18% lower than 2017. Thirty-six water conservation 

initiatives saved 329 million litres of water, an equivalent 

value of over US$765,000, while over 541 million litres of 

water used by the Group was recycled or recaptured. 

In partnership with the China Environmental Protection 

Fund (see page 42), we installed safe drinking water facilities 

at Central Primary School in Yangshuo County, benefitting 

1,096 students and teachers, and supported by education 

activities on water conservation, health and safety. 

Safe Water Gardens

Access to clean running water is a basic human right, but possessed 

by only three families in rural Bumi Indah village in Bintan. Pumps, 

water tanks and sinks were installed in 37 households delivering 

lifelong safe sanitation to homes, boosting self-esteem and reducing 

existing inequality between city and village populations. 

Installations used simple and reliable construction methods, with widely 

available materials so the community can maintain their water systems. An 

average of five taps per house were provided to serve water to the kitchen, 

bathroom and garden, encouraging good hygiene for COVID-19 prevention, 

as well as crop and flower gardening for improved food security.

Recipient: Safe Water Gardens, Loola Adventure Group







Total waste reduced by 8% to 7,829 cubic metres and 

waste production decreased by 12.5% to 14.0 litres POR for 

EarthCheck registered properties and business units, largely 

due to increased recycling efforts. Absolute waste production 

in 2021 was 16% lower than 2017. Potentially hazardous 

waste associated with the pandemic such as face masks 

were disposed of according to local health regulations. 

Recycling initiatives at 21 properties engaged over 2,200 

participants, where waste was recycled, donated, or 

transformed into art to raise awareness of best practice 

and reduce waste to landfill. In 2022, we shall implement 

compulsory waste monitoring and recycling tracking at all 

properties including those not registered with EarthCheck.

Energy and Emissions 

Total energy use and corresponding Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse 

gas emissions (GHG) increased by 13% and 11% respectively 

due to resuming operations and new openings. Energy 

use increased to 1,297,028 GJ, comprising 55% purchased 

electricity, 42% stationary fuel and 3% mobile fuel, while 

GHG emissions increased to 113,660 tonnes. Total energy use 

and GHG emissions were both 24% lower than 2017 despite 

new property openings, due to improvements in resource 

efficiency and some temporary operational closures in 2021.

Energy use and GHG production intensity (POR) increased 

by 3.4% and 6.6% respectively, largely due to baseloads 

and lower occupancies compared to pre-COVID. Seventy-

four energy conservation initiatives saved 5.02 million kWh 

worth US$1.26m in 2021, predominantly driven by LED and 

air conditioner replacements, and energy-saving behavioural 

changes. We are targeting a complete elimination of 

incandescent bulbs and full transition to LEDs by end of 2023.

Plastic Reduction and Elimination 

Plastic production and consumption contribute to greenhouse 

gas emissions and pose a significant threat to the health 

and wellbeing of people and the planet. Since our pledge 

to reduce single-use plastic on Earth Day 2018, we have 

tracked 31 categories of plastic for reduction. Compared 

to a 2017 baseline, we have reduced single-use plastic 

by 53%, with almost 9 million less pieces of plastic used 

in 2021, totalling 28.6 million pieces of plastic prevented 

from going to landfill or the environment since 2018. 

We used over 2,400 km less cling film in 2021 compared 

to the 2017 baseline, with a cumulative saving of 4,514 

km less cling film used since 2017: almost the distance 

from Singapore to South Korea. Of three prioritised items, 

we have reduced 2.4 million straws (98% reduction), 1.7 

million bottles (41%) and 1.3 million bags (46%) across the 

Group. Bag use increased in 2021 due to ongoing COVID-

associated health protocols. These reductions were achieved 

despite the inclusion of use by newly opened properties. 

Our property in Vietnam added a water bottling plant in 

2021, eliminating 360,000 plastic bottles annually, joining 

our properties in Bintan and the Maldives in bottling 

locally to reduce plastic waste. The top ten performing 

properties have reduced single-use plastic by more than 

80%, with seven properties achieving reductions over 90% 

in 2021. The overall reduction trend in single-use plastic 

for the Group continues despite reduced operations, newly 

opened properties and the increase in select items due 

to necessary health measures during the pandemic. 

We support our reduction efforts with collaborative community 

clean-ups (see page 28) to remediate and cleanse natural 

systems, support a shift from a single-use disposable society, 

as well as protect biodiversity threatened by plastic waste.

Agricultural waste in the marshes and flooded grasslands of the Anlung Pring Protected 

Area, a high-priority wetland in Cambodia, threatens the resident population of 

globally threatened Sarus Crane. A community-based waste disposal system was 

implemented in consultation with local communities to better manage and dispose 

potentially hazardous agricultural chemical waste, mitigating risk of leaking potentially 

toxic agro-pollutants into an already fragile, fragmented wetland ecosystem. 

Interviews revealed willingness of local villagers to dispose of waste properly following 

awareness meetings that developed understanding about the impact of pollution on 

agricultural land, human health, and local wildlife. Following requests for the scheme 

to be expanded, waste disposal systems have been installed in four villages, training 

sessions and awareness meetings organised among farmer groups, and rangers trained 

to both track and record wildlife poisoning incidents and intercept illegal hunting. 

 



Food and the Environment  

Food loss and waste accounts for over US$1 trillion in 

economic losses and 8% of greenhouse gas emissions 

globally. Food production also uses 25% of global 

freshwater and a larger land area than China. Achieving 

net-zero is impossible without tackling food loss and waste, 

and sustainable food choices benefit climate change, 

biodiversity, water availability and personal health.

Our food waste goals are 30% reduction and 50% diversion 

from landfill by 2025, with 50% reduction and 100% 

diversion by 2030. Our diversion efforts recycled or donated 

280.7 tonnes of food in 2021, but temporary closures 

prevented accurate measurement of the total food footprint 

of the Group. Our property in Ringha purchased three pigs 

for recycling food waste, and our team in Tamouda Bay 

partnered with Ekogeste to recycle frying oil into biodiesel. 

Composting organic waste at our property in Vietnam 

produced an additional 180 tonnes of natural fertiliser, with 

a saving of US$51,662 from purchasing chemical fertiliser.

Food diversion can reduce emissions, and the ongoing 

partnership with Scholars of Sustenance in Thailand 

contributed a further 6.8 tonnes of diverted food, and saved 

12.9 tonnes of GHG equivalent emissions. To date this 

partnership has provided 40,868 servings to people in need, 

diverting almost 10 tonnes of food from landfills, saving 

16.9 tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions. Meat Free days 

continued at 23 properties to support methane reductions 

and awareness of climate change impact from food, and 13 

properties operated organic gardens and farms. Our organic 

farm ORI9IN in Chiang Mai, Thailand, opened the ‘Waiting 

for May’ picnic restaurant serving field-to-fork sustainable 

dishes made using locally grown and sourced ingredients. 

Sustainable food is not just what you eat, but where 

it comes from and how it is produced. To support our 

understanding of our food supply, we partnered with a Pew 

Charitable Trust project to better understand IUU (Illegal, 

Unreported and Unregulated) seafood in our Phuket supply 

chain, to learn lessons for implementation in the Group. 





Strengthening community stewardship towards 

the conservation of unique aquatic wildlife 

in India’s Ghaghra-Sarju River system

Strengthening community participation and amalgamating traditional 

lifestyles with conservation initiatives supports the conservation of 

unique aquatic wildlife and establishes a self-sustainable, community-led 

conservation model for others to follow. A makeshift “turtle school” at the 

River Conservation Centre benefitted 154 non-school going children from 

four hamlets, imparting primary education and nurturing conservation 

awareness. Alternate livelihood training in innovative small-scale farming to 

28 women and river tourism to 24 fishers helped reduce families’ dependence 

on riverbed agriculture and aquatic wildlife, and further support food and 

nutritional security of households with no or limited land resources.

Training was given to Palabuhanratu Harbour Port Authority and students 

from Universitas Padjadjaran, who sampled 47 Giant Devil Rays and 61 

Bentfin Devil Rays caught in small-scale fisheries in West Java, eastern 

Indian Ocean. Vertebrae samples were aged, and tissue samples underwent 

genetic analysis to determine population structure in the Indian Ocean. 

This information furthers our understanding of population boundaries

Degraded mangrove ecosystem restoration and 

community empowerment in Mahakam Delta

The Mahakam Delta in Borneo provides significant carbon 

sequestration combating climate change as well as home to critically 

endangered species. Reforesting mangroves and establishing alternative 

livelihoods for locals is crucial to restoring this degraded delta. 

Plastic polybags typically used to protect seedlings were replaced 

by environmentally friendly ecopolybags made from woven nipah 

palm leaves. Durable against natural elements, these ecopolybags 

have also given locals a new skill to generate additional income. 

A community nursery developed by this project accommodates 

7,500 mangrove seedlings, with 5,000 mangrove trees planted in 

10 ha of degraded mangrove forest. This was supported by survival 

monitoring and awareness sessions on the damaging nature of plastic 

waste, and importance of protecting the mangrove ecosystem.

Environmental Monitoring  

Long-term monitoring detects environmental change 

and informs conservation efforts. Annual reef monitoring 

using established and scientifically rigorous protocols 

was conducted for the ninth consecutive year in Bintan, 

and extended from three to six sites. In the Maldives, 

annual reef monitoring was not feasible for the seventh 

consecutive year due to challenges getting a team in place 

during the ongoing pandemic, but will resume in 2022. 

Surveys are supported by data from citizen scientist sightings, 

to detect long-term variation in the presence and abundance 

of easily recognised charismatic megafauna such as birds, 

sharks or turtles. Any associate or guest, with minimal training 

and guidance, can contribute observations as a citizen 

scientist in the Maldives and in Bintan, and we expanded 

this initiative to Phuket in 2022. Participation in our specially 

curated programmes allows travellers to connect with local 

nature, learn about the animals they see, and contribute 

their sightings data to support conservation action.

Conservation of muntjac in 

Bach Ma National Park

Bach Ma National Park is home to two endemic threatened species of 

muntjac deer. Information on their populations is sparse but urgently 

needed to create effective conservation strategies. Populations were 

assessed using non-invasive scientifically robust systematic surveys from 

40 camera-trap stations on the Bach Ma summit. Artificial mineral licks 

were used at half the stations to assess effectiveness at increasing muntjac 

detection rates. Preliminary data indicate a potentially sizeable population 

in the area, with detections at 15 sites, and data are being analysed to 

identify patterns in distributions needed for future management.

Science-Based Conservation  

Meaningful engagement with experts through cross-sector 

collaboration supports our goals to protect, manage and 

restore biodiversity. A strategic and science-based approach 

to conservation partners with stakeholders possessing domain 

expertise to engage and educate travellers, communities and 

our associates. Our adaptive conservation framework addresses 

key global issues, critical habitats and priority species†.

Dedicated conservation centres in the Maldives and 

Indonesia support education, restoration and research 

programmes. We actively seek and support partnerships 

to address local conservation needs and generate data for 

local and regional management. In 2021, the inaugural 

recipients of our Greater Good Grants implemented 

projects to conserve threatened ecosystems and species.

GREATER GOOD GRANT

Endangered Species Conservation 

Turtle conservation programmes at six properties generate 

awareness among travellers, local communities and fishermen 

through nest protection and release of 419 hatchlings in 

2021 in partnership with local organisations and research 

centres in Indonesia, the Maldives, Mexico and Vietnam. 

Annual monitoring of shark populations in the Maldives was 

put on hold during the pandemic. Following a call to reopen 

the shark fishery in the Maldives, the Ocean Geographic 

Society organised an online expert panel discussion that our 

team joined alongside marine biologist Dr Sylvia Earle to 

support continuation of shark protection in the Maldives. Our 

data were shared with the Ministry of Environment, to inform 

their decision to continue protection for sharks in the Maldives.



Awareness and education serve as the cornerstone for 

conservation. We promoted awareness and engagement among 

our associates through Earth Day and World Environment 

Day campaigns, with 2,900 associates making 8,437 pledges 

to change behaviour to conserve the environment and tackle 

climate change by car-pooling, recycling waste or eating 

plant-based meals in 2021. Our team in Penang, Malaysia 

also celebrated World Pangolin Day by partnering with 

1StopBorneo Wildlife to host an educational webinar. 

Collective partnership and action is required to deliver 

on conservation goals, and our “Greater Good Grants” 

issued by the Banyan Tree Global Foundation supported 

conservation projects that promoted community 

stewardship and conservation of threatened species 

in India, Indonesia, Cambodia and Vietnam. Our 

partnership with the China Environmental Protection 

Foundation constructed clownfish breeding facilities at 

the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology to support 

population recovery through large-scale breeding.

Community conservation to restore 

and protect Borneo’s rainforests

Illegal logging and hunting threatens the Gunung Leuser National Park 

and its protected wildlife species such as the Sumatran slow loris. Homes 

and villages located around the forest buffer area have limited land 

for subsistence agriculture and forest products. Alternative community 

livelihoods through permaculture and agroforestry were promoted by 

establishing a forest plant nursery for a 30-farmer group in Garunggang 

village. Illegal logging and hunting activities have decreased due to joint 

forestry patrols, environmental awareness workshops and campaigns, 

and the installation of signboards in the forest and surrounding 

villages. A number of wild animals have been rescued and released, 

including the Sumatran slow loris, bearcats and a leopard cat.

livelihoods, so an Associate Emergency Loan Scheme to 

support essential living costs issued interest-free personal 

loans helping 827 associates through this difficult time. 

Associate welfare continues to be supported by an Associate 

Saving Cooperative for associates in Phuket, Thailand, 

although membership and volume decreased in 2021. 

The health and safety of our associates is supported by 

a structured and coherent approach to Enterprise Risk 

Management based on the Committee of Sponsoring 

Organizations of the Treadway Commission Internal 

Control – Integrated Framework (“COSO Framework”). 

On a quarterly basis, all significant risks to the Group and/

or properties which have been identified and managed are 

highlighted at the Audit &amp; Risk Committee (ARC) meetings. 

Mandatory KPIs of 100% associate fire awareness training 

and 30% of associates trained in CPR at each property 

were exceeded for all reporting operational properties (41 

hotels and resorts). Workplace accident data were aligned 

with SGX definitions, with no fatalities, 3 high consequence 

injuries, 236 recordable injuries, and 91 recordable work-

related ill health cases worldwide in 2021. We will continue 

to track these new metrics and continually review and, 

where opportunities arise, revise our processes to mitigate 

risk. By the end of 2021, 6,421 associates (97%) were 

double vaccinated against COVID-19, we also supported 

community vaccinations and wellbeing (see page 37). In 

2021, we had 478 COVID-19 cases, with all recovered.

OUR COMMUNITY

Associate Satisfaction 

and Wellbeing 

Banyan Tree Group is committed to the happiness, safety, 

health and wellbeing of our associates and guests by 

combining wellbeing and sustainability in a single concept. 

A simple, structured and codified approach of eight 

wellbeing pillars enables leisure travellers to enrich their 

stay and encourages associates towards collective action and 

personal fulfilment. Our approach creates personal practices 

that can be sustained beyond a stay or outside work.

Potential isolation from continued temporary operational 

closures directed our focus to stakeholder engagement 

(pages 9 to 11) with an emphasis on associate interaction 

and connectivity via online learning and development 

(paged 31 and 32) during this challenging time, rather 

than the annual associate satisfaction survey which will 

recommence in 2022 when the pandemic subsides. 

Online training in 17 outlets amounting to 6,400 hours 

was issued to improve physical and mental wellbeing of 

associates and supported by weekly wellbeing and health 

tips in six languages to associates worldwide via our new 

brand app on which 80% of associates have registered.

This support builds on our previous introduction of a 

flexible employment programme to protect jobs, a rehiring 

app to help associates find new roles and access reskilling 

training, complimentary tele-therapy sessions with external 

practitioners to support associate wellbeing, and an 

internal learning revolution to promote resilience, self-

awareness and self-care. The pandemic continued to strain

OUR COMMUNITY

Empowering 

Education

















Community education programmes support life and 

professional skills development to empower people with 

the opportunity and tools to succeed. Inclusive and quality 

education programmes are adapted support local needs, 

improving livelihoods and providing pathways out of poverty.

Seedlings Mentorship 

Our Seedlings Mentorship programme provides 

vocational and life skills, creating a lasting positive 

community impact. A “big-brother” or

“big-sister” mentorship approach with scholarship supports 

young people aged 12 to 18 at risk of societal exclusion. 

Structured topics guide mentor-mentee interactions 

to reinforce social (heritage, culture, arts and crafts), 

environmental (conservation), academic (language and 

computing), and health values (nutrition and lifestyle).

In 2021, external trainers from the Pink Lotus Foundation 

delivered mentor training to strengthen programme delivery 

and increase the skill set of Banyan Tree Group mentors. 

Face-to-face mentorship opportunities remained limited 

in 2021 with only 79 equivalent work days of mentorship 

provided (632 hours) to 121 Seedlings students supported by 

27 properties. Since inception, 177 Seedlings mentees have 

been supported for up to 6 years each in this programme.

Following the success of the Seedlings Café internships at 

Laguna Phuket since 2014, Banyan Tree Group launched 

a new Apprenticeship Programme in 2021 with funding 

support from Banyan Tree Global Foundation. This 

programme provides trade, service and life skills

I Am With You

Our Service Culture is about being engaged 

with our guests, partners and associates in a 

meaningful and purposeful pattern that focuses 

on key ambassadorial qualities of being present, 

positive, open-minded, empathetic and authentic. 

Better Me, Better You and Better Us.

We Team,  

Together We Execute 

Our Service Culture is about working together as one, 

breaking down communication isolation and drawing 

upon divergent views and skillsets, to develop consensus 

and maintain credibility through clarity of purpose and 

action plans; critical skills to create organisational success.

We Embrace  

the Environment,  

We Empower People 

Our Sustainability Culture is about creating 

shared value, through the persevering search for 

solutions and thirst for adventure, to help the 

environment and community where we operate.

We Make  

Differences Matter  

Our Diversity and Inclusion Culture is about 

respect for differences; we believe everyone 

matters and we must learn to create a seat 

around the table for all to share their thoughts 

and perspectives, from top to bottom.

What’s New, What Works,  

We Change to Delight  

Our Guests

Our Innovation Culture is about continually 

exploring interesting business models and ways of 

meeting the expectations of travellers to find our 

market positioning in a competitive environment.

WeGo, We Care 

Our Wellbeing Culture is about creating a supportive 

and nourishing environment without ego, to understand 

the importance of self-care before we extend care to 

others. Mindfulness is a significant discovery tool in 

fortifying our self-assurance and self-confidence. 

We Create Deeper Value

Our Marketing Culture is about perspective 

and information to tell the same brand story, 

using the same brand language, knowing the 

differences and Unique Selling Point of the Group, 

the brands to serve as a Brand ambassador.

We Grow to Understand

Our Marketing Culture is about learning, unlearning, 

and relearning, championing a growth mind-set 

that understands peoples and cultures in a deeper 

way to foster inter-cultural acceptance and respect; 

adopting a global business perspective by piecing 

together complex scenarios with many moving parts, 

to discover the numerous business options before us.

Management Academy 

Established in 2008, Banyan Tree Management Academy 

(BTMA) serves as a centralised training facility that supports 

organisational goals by advancing people development 

and management excellence. Building on the success of 

our service culture programme “I Am With You” in 2020, 

a further seven core culture workshops were developed for 

wellbeing, sustainability, diversity and inclusion, marketing, 

team, innovation and learning. Combined, these eight 

cultures support organisational and individual success. 

Ongoing business disruptions from the global pandemic 

provided the impetus to deliver 124 online learning sessions 

and workshops from BTMA, reaching a greater number 

of associates than ever before while bringing together 

associates from different geographies to learn together. 

Graduation data was not available for online workshop 

sessions conducted in 2021. These efforts were further 

supported by a learning needs analysis to target development 

of trainers on each property and ongoing revisions of 

key service and management skills training courses.

COMMUNITY IMPACT

Support for St Jude India  

ChildCare Centres 

Support for St Jude India ChildCare Centres 

provided safe, clean, comfortable caring space 

for children during their cancer treatment. 

Despite ongoing COVID pandemic and fatigue, 

St Jude supported 2,128 children providing 

98,458 peaceful nights for families in their

Bintan, Indonesia, and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Every year we celebrate World Tourism Day to engage 

travellers, explorers, our associates, businesses and 

communities to support local livelihoods and the conservation 

of our natural world. No single element of society can bring 

about long-term sustainable prosperity; this can only be 

achieved through a cohesive collaborative approach in a  

post-pandemic world.

Tourism must serve as a steward of local culture on which it 

is often intrinsically dependent. Our approach to preserve 

cultural heritage includes celebrating local cultural festivals, 

engaging guests, associates and community members to 

promote awareness and drive responsible travel, supporting 

local businesses and community cooperatives to protect 

cultural artisanal traditions in our supply chain, and 

connecting with food as a strong cultural tradition. 

Banyan Tree Group’s wellness and retail segments embody 

sustainability as a core pillar in their business strategies to 

uphold cultural heritage where we operate. In 2021, our 

in-house socially motivated brand MATTER Prints ceased 

operations due to supply chains vulnerable to COVID-19. 

Gallery

skills through gainful employment. Partnership selections 

are based on three stringent categories: conservation, 

community and cause of work. To date, the Gallery has 

supported 177 communities, but the number of active 

communities declined in 2021 due to the ongoing pandemic.

implemented 2,004 sustainable events and initiatives, 

with our associates volunteering almost 100,000 hours to 

serve communities and environments where we operate. 

Increasingly, travellers are looking for greater purpose, 

and over the past five years we have engaged over 

235,000 guests in our programmes to promote responsible 

travel despite the ongoing COVID-19 situation. 

This is the 16th consecutive annual sustainability report 

issued by the Banyan Tree Group. The achievements 

herein are the combined effort of all associates borne from 

shared responsibility and belief. We report transparently, 

sharing successes and failures to support our own 

and collective learning through an iterative process 

to improve. As the last report in this materiality cycle, 

this report is not the end but a transition to new needs, 

opportunities and ways of doing business as we work 

towards the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. 

 opportunities and ways of doing business as we work 

towards the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. 

OUR RESPONSIBILITY

Leadership

Businesses can serve as a vehicle for deeper value creation, 

with profit the fuel, organisational purpose the compass, 

and leadership providing the roadmap. Adaptive and 

agile leadership has rarely been more important than 

during the past two years of uncertainty. Each individual 

is a steward of the company, its values and culture. 

In 2021, we continued to strengthen our core cultures, 

to bridge organisational and personal purpose to inspire 

and support our associates. We focused on learning 

and development, bringing people together during an 

ongoing time of isolation and stress, with an emphasis 

on wellbeing, purpose and togetherness to support 

a sustainable, inclusive and resilient approach to 

business that upholds and generates shared values. 

Climate risk and material ESG topics (page 8) were 

incorporated into our Enterprise Risk Management in 2021, 

with quarterly progress reports to the Audit &amp; Risk Committee 

and the sustainability strategy is discussed by the Board as 

a whole. The composition of our Board of Directors can be 

found in the Annual Report (pages 48 to 51). Each property 

has a designated sustainability representative and ‘green 

team’ that meets monthly to originate bottom-up ideas and 

communicate progress. The Banyan Tree Global Foundation 

and regional sustainability coordinators meet monthly to 

engage senior management and provide top-down support.

A stakeholder-inclusive approach supports our participation, 

collaboration and leadership locally where we operate and 

within the industry (see page 11), as we continue to strive 

to go beyond the precautionary or least-harm approach, 

and be proactive and innovative in implementation. We 

align our efforts with global frameworks (page 12), while 

addressing local needs. In the last three years we have 

Ethical Compliance and Anti-Corruption

Banyan Tree Group continually seeks to enhance corporate 

transparency and stakeholder accountability to create value 

with integrity. Business is conducted in accordance with 

the highest level of ethics and law compliance, following 

international and local anti-corruption, anti-bribery and 

labour laws, rules and regulations in countries where we 

operate. We expect the same standards from those with 

whom we do business (see Supply Chain, page 40).

As a publicly traded company, our Board of Directors 

and management teams are committed to maintaining the 

highest standards of corporate governance based on the 

recommendations of the Code of Corporate Governance. 

In 2021, we had zero incidents of corruption or bribery, 

and no business partnerships were terminated or not 

renewed due to corruption. Over 3,100 (46%) of our 

associates received anti-corruption training in 2021.







97%

associates signed code 

of conduct in 2021

Our Code of Conduct strengthens associates’ awareness 

of good corporate conduct, governs conflicts of interest, 

ensures freedom from sexual harassment, and was supported 

by awareness training delivered to 4,941 associates in 2021 

(71% of associates). All associates are required to sign the 

Code of Conduct annually, with 97% completion in 2021. 

We promote diversity and inclusiveness, hire without 

discrimination and recognise freedom of association (see 

page 41). Our confidential whistle-blower policy affords 

freedom to report violations without retaliation.

We are committed to uphold the Ten Universal 

Principles as a founding member and signatory of the 

United Nations Global Compact in Singapore, and we 

support the United Nations World Tourism Organisation 

Global Code of Ethics. Compliance to Banyan Tree 

Group’s sustainability standards are assessed by 

EarthCheck’s third-party audits of environmental, social, 

operational and governance systems and initiatives, 

and an annual self-audit with remote verification by 

the regional sustainability coordinators and BTGF.





Tourism can act as a platform for peace 

and shared prosperity by bringing 

together people from different countries 

and cultures to enjoy, celebrate and 

protect the natural and cultural heritage 

of destinations. Our responsibility 

extends beyond the precautionary 

approach, to serve society as stewards 

with ethical, accountable and inclusive 

leadership for long-term sustainability 

and shared value creation. We employ a 

stakeholder-inclusive approach to address 

local needs and develop partnerships 

that create positive impact towards 

the Sustainable Development Goals.

Responsibility

OUR RESPONSIBILITY

Differences matter. We celebrate diversity and the value it 

brings to the workplace and service of 175 nationalities of 

guests who visited Banyan Tree Group in 2021. Operating in 

27 countries, with 50 nationalities of associates (page 4), we 

remain committed to fostering, preserving and cultivating a 

culture of diversity as a moral imperative. The make-up of 

our Group, and how we value and integrate the presence 

and differing views, perspectives, cultures and experiences 

are of fundamental importance to our brand culture.

We are committed to uphold and respect human rights. 

Diversity and inclusion is more than policies, programmes 

or headcounts. Acknowledging differences and respecting 

uniqueness in our associates builds trust and commitment. 

We embrace diversity in the broadest term, including culture, 

ethnicity, nationality, gender, age, religion, education and 

physical ability. We continue to leverage our diversity 

policy to ensure female candidates are represented in senior 

management, increasing to 39.3% in 2021 from 37.6% in 2020 

(see page 4). A third of the Independent Directors on the Board 

are women, and the Board Diversity is governed by a policy 

framework incorporating skillsets, functional and industry 

expertise, international experience, gender, age, tenure, 

independence, ethnicity, culture, and other relevant factors. 

Our inclusive approach engages all stakeholders (pages 9 

to 11), creating a safe environment that supports physical 

and mental wellbeing (page 30) in an ethical manner (page 

39) with supportive participatory leadership and bottom-

up engagement (page 39). We employ and upskill locally 

to support communities where we operate, and remain 

committed to selecting the best people based on qualifications, 

experience and competences to provide pathways of personal 

and professional fulfilment. We promote awareness and 

address long-standing inequalities, celebrating cultures (page 

41) and women’s empowerment on International Women’s 

Day and beyond. Since creation, the Banyan Tree Spa has 

empowered women in 60 spas and 30 destinations worldwide. 

Our goal is not to force people to fit, but help them to thrive. 

Gender pay gap reporting is on the rise, with a global 20% 

gender pay gap where women on average earn 80 cents for 

every dollar a man earns. At the current pace, it will take 

108 years to close this gap (World Economic Forum, 2019). 

To transparently support our gender equality efforts we 

report gender pay gap for the first time. Gender pay gap was 

analysed for 6,755 permanent associates across the Banyan 

Tree Group, although data were not available for franchised 

hotels, Mauritius, Cuba properties or newly opened Corfu. 

Unadjusted gender pay gap, a direct comparison of mean 

male and female annualised salary, was 5.0% in 2021, with 

women earning US$0.950 for every dollar a man earned. The 

unadjusted median gender pay gap was -3.7% in 2021, with 

women earning US$1.037 for every dollar a man earned. 

This favourable gender pay gap is due to the roles occupied 

by women in front of house, Spa and leadership roles. 

The adjusted pay gap, calculated using ordinary least 

squares regression factoring for human capital and business 

controls (age, education, job grade, length of service, local/

expat, location, and department), was 3.3%, with women 

earning US$0.967 for every dollar a man earned. 

A deep dive in adjusted gender pay gap allows us to 

identify drivers of gender salary inequality (geographic, 

human or business), on which we can act and manage 

equality in pay, which we will explore in 2022. 

Diversity, Equality

OUR RESPONSIBILITY

Data privacy and protection are key business challenges and 

the responsibility of the whole organisation. Our holistic 

management approach to legal compliance and operational 

management fosters a culture of awareness to respect and 

ensure the privacy of our stakeholders. Data privacy policies 

ensure compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act 

2012 in Singapore, and the European Union’s General Data 

Protection Regulation (GDPR). 

Internal IT Risk Management and Audit teams review best 

practices and enforce company security policies to identify 

gaps and support IT policy governance. A partner ISO/IEC 

27001:2013 certified cybersecurity consulting firm acts as 

Security Operations Centre (SOC) to monitor, detect and 

respond to potential security threats. Audits target the control 

of digital data access and mitigate risks of such access, 

Data Privacy

ensuring rapid implementation of critical security patches and 

firewall updates. Audit recommendations and suggestions are 

implemented to address ongoing security threats. Insurance 

coverage is in place to protect against cybersecurity risks.

Associate awareness and engagement with data security occurs 

through policies and regular information sharing on prevailing 

risks and recommended actions. Group-wide cybersecurity 

training for IT personnel and access point users was delivered 

to 4,643 associates (67%) in 2021, with no substantiated 

complaints, breaches or losses of customer data identified. 

Supply chain management is more than risk management, 

it is an opportunity to make responsible choices and 

evangelise business practices that respect human rights 

and the environment. We communicate our commitment 

to our suppliers, and actively seek and favour business 

with suppliers who share our values. Since 2020, we have 

implemented an online supplier Code of Conduct with a KPI 

of 80% dollar purchases from Tier 1 suppliers completing 

self-assessments. By 2025, we target 100% annual 

completion, with evaluation of poor supplier performance 

or non-conformity supported by remediation plans. 

Our supply chain consists of input providers (infrastructure, 

water and energy, equipment, food and beverages), service 

delivery (accommodation, catering and attractions), and travel. 

Following disruption in 2020, we drove supplier engagement 

and awareness in 2021. Our supply chain comprised of 4,653

OUR RESPONSIBILITY

Future Directions

Due to the many unforeseen impacts of COVID-19, we conducted a new material analysis in 2021. The upcoming year will 

require substantial strategic development, building on current efforts while transitioning to address new challenges.  

Targets will be set and baselines established against which to measure progress for each material topic. External 

stakeholders will be consulted to determine the scope of impact on which each material topic strategy shall be 

developed, addressing local needs framed within global agenda and the new Singapore Stock Exchange reporting 

framework. We will implement new policies and procedures, supported by an internal auditing process to transparently 

evaluate performance, where we will incorporate performance evaluations to further support accountability.

Our future holds many new opportunities to support the pressing challenges faced by communities 

and environments where we operate, reimagine business and mitigate our impacts, engage travellers 

and promote responsible action by “Embracing the Environment, Empowering People”.

Embracing the Environment

Climate Change  

Tourism contributes significantly to climate 

change through high energy and resource 

use, infrastructure development and complex 

supply chains, with potential to impact global 

climates and local destination quality. 

The development of a comprehensive decarbonisation 

strategy is a priority in 2022. Building on our 

EarthCheck-audited energy use and Scope 1 and 

2 emissions, we will conduct a TCFD-aligned 

risk assessment under multiple climate scenarios 

to map risk and opportunity, as a foundation to 

establish targets and develop a decarbonisation 

roadmap. We will explore renewable Power 

Purchase Agreement projects, green space 

valuation methodologies, Scope 3 emissions, and 

nature-based projects to support our net-zero goals. 

Waste and Water  

The tourism industry is prone to overconsumption; 

tourists often produce more than twice as much waste 

as local residents, and high water consumption risks 

depleting water catchments, tables and reserves, 

potentially depriving local communities and stressing 

environments. Achieving net-zero is impossible 

without careful management and disposal of waste.

Waste management tracking protocols will be 

established to better measure and drive reductions in 

waste. We will quantify the climate impact of waste 

to support reduction efforts, and engage suppliers to 

avoid excess waste through procurement. Although we 

currently track water consumption, we will develop a 

new strategy to better understand water sourcing and 

impact of removal, and explore potential projects to 

conserve water and protect community access rights.

Health and Wellbeing   

Tourism is responsible for the health and 

wellbeing of its employees, but it may also 

impact communities through increased traffic 

or transboundary exposure and transmission of 

infections, as experienced during COVID-19. 

Efforts will focus internally on supporting 

associate wellbeing and satisfaction, while 

we develop quantifiable targets against 

which we can contribute towards community 

health and wellbeing, and identify projects to 

support community and women’s health. 

Diversity, Equality and Inclusion  

Respect and appreciation of diversity and equality 

in all forms are required to strengthen employee 

base, foster collaboration and improve customer 

service. An inclusive and equitable tourism industry 

supports socio-economic growth and pathways 

out of poverty, providing long-term gainful 

employment that benefits local communities. 

We optionally selected this material topic as it 

remains central to our core values. We will refine 

our strategic approach and develop KPIs with a deep 

dive into gender equality in our group, leverage 

training and socio-economic development with 

an inclusive approach to benefit our associates 

and the communities where we operate.
