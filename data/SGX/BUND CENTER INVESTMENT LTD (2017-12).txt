BUND CENTER INVESTMENT LTD

DEAR STAkEHOLDERS, 

As Bund Center Investment Ltd (“BCI” or “the Company”) 

and its subsidiaries (collectively “the Group”) celebrate its 

8th anniversary as a listed Company on the Singapore 

Securities Trading Ltd (“SGX”), we are pleased to present 

our inaugural Sustainability Report. This report, which 

has been approved by the Board of Directors (“Board”), 

presents BCI’s material sustainability or environmental, 

social, and governance (“ESG”) issues, our approach in 

managing these issues, and setting their performance 

indicators.

While sustainability reporting is new to BCI, sustainability 

as a business imperative is not new to the Group and we 

understand the importance of sustainability and delivering 

our commitments to key stakeholders. Please refer to 

page 9 of this report for more detailed information on our 

Sustainability Vision.

In 2017, we conducted Materiality Assessment internally to 

identify our material ESG issues and integrate it into our 

existing risk management framework so as to ensure that the 

Board is kept abreast of its happenings and has the ability 

to support our management team in addressing them. The 

Board is also supported by the Audit Committee as well as 

the Enterprise Risk Management Committee in managing 

the Group’s sustainability initiatives and programs.

Within our operations, a robust governance and risk management framework guides the organisation in 

conducting our business ethically. We adopt a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. There were no 

legal cases regarding corruption which were brought against the Group, or its subsidiaries during the year 

under review.

Occupational safety, health and well-being are of paramount importance to us. We are pleased to report 

that there were no fatalities or instances of occupational diseases in our Hospitality and Asset Management 

divisions. We will continue to assess and improve our internal controls to reduce the occurrence of accidents, 

injuries and illnesses to all our employees. 

It is our responsibility as an employer to provide a conducive and inclusive workplace for our employees’ 

development, well-being and satisfaction. Recognising that people are the main driver of our success, 

we treat all our employees equally, fairly, and with respect, offering them an equal opportunities policy on 

employment. We are committed to contributing back to the economic and social development of the society 

through local community engagements and development programs in our PRC operations.  We believe that 

our Sustainability Vision will enable us to continue delivering value for all our stakeholders.

Our accomplishments in 2017 were made possible due to teamworks and full commitments of the Group 

colleagues.  As we look to the future, we aim to further integrate sustainability into our operations and culture 

so that we can continue to deliver hard work and dedication to local community and environmental needs.

How We Report

Being new to sustainability reporting, we are committed 

to implementing the reporting requirements by 

leveraging on our continuous improvements approach.

This report covers the period from 1 January to 31 

December 2017 (“FY 2017”). Going forward, we will 

be publishing this report on an annual basis. Our 

sustainability report will be published in an online 

format which reduce an environmental impact and 

make our reporting more targeted and accessible to 

our stakeholders.

Our sustainability report contains detailed information 

on our material issues, as well as the impact of our 

operations on society and the environment. We 

recognise that sustainability reporting is a journey 

and are adopting a phase implementation approach 

in line with SGX sustainability reporting requirements 

with a 3 years progressive report. To ensure that we 

establish proper reporting processes before starting 

to report on the entire Group, this reporting scope 

encompasses the operations and focuses on our 

hotel flagship Westin Bund Center Shanghai and 

Bund Center Office Tower, the major contributors 

to the Group in terms of asset size, profitability and 

staff strength.

About This Report

Board of Directors’ Statement 

The Board of BCI has the ultimate responsibility for the preparation of this Sustainability 

Report. This inaugural report has been prepared in accordance with the Global 

Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core Option. It also meets the requirements of 

the 2016 SGX Sustainability Reporting Guide in all material aspects.

The Board is working with the Audit Committee (“AC”) to provide oversight on significant 

environmental, social and governance issues that might have an impact on BCI’s long 

term business objectives. The AC in turn reviews BCI’s sustainability programs and 

ensures the Board is always kept up to date on all relevant developments. We have set 

up a Sustainability Governance structure as detailed on page 11.

The Board has reviewed the process by which BCI’s Material Issues were determined 

and agreed that the issues thus determined and reported on in this report are an 

adequate representation of BCI’s material ESG issues.

Giving special consideration to our peers who are 

acknowledged leaders in sustainability, we chose 

the GRI reporting framework to ensure accuracy, 

reliability, clarity, and comparability of the information 

presented in this report.

We are not going to seek external assurance for this 

report, but intend to do so at some point in the future. 

For now, our main focus is on embedding sustainability 

into the organisation, and seeking verification of our 

management systems.

We recommend reading this report together with our 

Annual Report 2017, which provides key information 

on our financial performance as well as additional 

details on our corporate governance and risk 

management. Both reports are critical communication 

pieces in the ongoing and transparent engagement 

of our stakeholders.

This report uses standard units of measurement. 

Conversion factors, where required and applicable, 

are explained in their respective sections. For any

Woo, Chief Risk Officer, Bund Center Investment Ltd

BUND CENTER INVESTMENT LTD

Our Approach



The 

Company’s 

Enterprise 

Risk 

Management 

Committee (“ERMC”) is central to the Company’s 

effort in building a sustainability culture. The ERMC 

champions sustainability principles, initiatives, and 

programs during the year and helps to establish 

departmental sustainability objectives and performance 

indicators, and is instrumental in the production of the 

annual sustainability report. The ERMC comprises 

representatives from the company’s business units, 

brought together to work collectively on driving the 

value of sustainability across the Company. 

Our sustainability structure consists of senior 

management, middle management and employees 

from various functions. 

By integrating sustainability initiatives tightly into 

our existing risk management, we can ensure that 

the Board is always kept abreast of our material 

sustainability issues, and the Group’s performance 

on the follow-up actions taken to address and mitigate 

them. As part of our preparations for this report, we 

have mapped most material issues to our Enterprise 

Risk Management (“ERM”) framework.

We place strong emphasis on complying with all 

national and regional level regulatory frameworks. 

These include regulations on operational permits, 

design and refurbishment, finance and accounting, 

labour laws, customer protection, and environmental 

frameworks. We adopt a zero tolerance approach 

towards corruption throughout BCI’s operations. No 

public legal cases regarding corruption were brought 

against the Group, or its subsidiaries.

We seek to proactively engage the relevant authorities 

to collaboratively develop solutions and frameworks 

such as waste management that will ensure the well-

being of our surrounding communities.

All our employees have been given briefings on 

the sustainability efforts of the Group in line with 

our initiatives of building a sustainability culture. In 

addition, our employees have also received clear 

guidance on the standards of ethical behaviour 

required of them through our Code of Conduct policy, 

supplemented by our whistleblowing policy that serves 

as an effective oversight measure for the prevention of 

fraud, corruption and other types of misconduct. We 

also have policies in place that cover procurement 

activities and fair employment practices. 

All newly hired employees are required to attend 

mandatory orientation training courses. During these 

training courses, new staffs are taught BCI’s core 

values and the policies listed above. We have yet to 

provide dedicated training on anti-corruption policies 

and procedures, but are currently evaluating the 

most effective way to introduce such training as a 

mandatory and annual exercise for all staffs.

Going forward, we will be working to achieve the 

following goals and shall report our progress in 

subsequent sustainability reports:

• Aim for full integration of sustainability governance, 

including the Board’s involvement.

• Maintain zero incidents of non-compliance with 

any relevant environmental and social regulatory 

frameworks.

• Gradual expansion of the scope of our sustainability 

reporting to include all other BCI projects.

• Full integration of sustainability metrics into our 

ERM system. 

Building A Culture of SuStAinABilitY

Building an internal culture of sustainability is key to our journey towards sustainability; this ensures that all members of the Company act upon a 

shared understanding of the importance of balancing the economic, environmental and social impacts of the Company’s operations. 


13

sustainability REPORt 2017

Materiality

BCI conducted a comprehensive materiality assessment on an annual basis in order to 

identify the most significant sustainability risks and opportunities of BCI. This assessment 

guides the prioritisation of topics identified during the stakeholder engagement process 

and helps us determine the economic, environmental and social issues that are of most 

interest or concern to the Company and its stakeholders, in order to strengthen the clarity 

of our resource allocation, report and communication.

The Materiality Matrix maps out the significant ESG and economic factors that impact our 

business, as well as insights gained from stakeholder engagements. It helps us to focus 

our efforts in paying attention to the values that are critical to the success of our business 

as well as the priorities of various stakeholders. It is reviewed regularly, taking into account 

the feedback that we receive from our engagement with a wide variety of stakeholders, 

broader sustainability trends and the issues facing the hospitality industry. 

Based on feedback from our various stakeholders, we have shortlisted the following 

material factors based on valuable insights that we have gained from our stakeholder 

engagement efforts, as well as factors that Management deems to have potential material 

impacts to our business operations. These are reviewed from time to time.

We identified the following categories of material issues along with an assessment of the 

significance of their economic, environmental and social impacts and their influence on 

stakeholders’ decisions as follows:

year’s sustainability report.

Our Approach


15

sustainability REPORt 2017

Our Approach

Stakeholder Engagement

BCI constantly engages a broad range of stakeholders including customers, national and local governments, 

local communities, interest groups and industry associations and shareholders. Our management carefully 

considers the occasionally diverging interests of these diverse groups and integrates them into our business 

strategy.

Throughout the reporting period, we have engaged external stakeholders through our regular channels, 

such as annual surveys, shareholder meetings and operational meetings. In addition, we interact with the 

communities through customer satisfaction surveys, engagement with local communities on education and 

healthcare, and working closely with various government entities on joint public infrastructure and safety 

projects (e.g. fire safety or public transport).

Examples of current stakeholder engagement exercises relating to sustainability topics are:  

• Annual Tenant Satisfaction Survey for our office buildings 

• Annual employee satisfaction survey 

• Marketing surveys for tenants, potential tenants, and hotel guests 

• Annual corporate brand awareness survey undertaken by the management 

• Local community and government sponsored CSR programs

Key topics raised by our internal and external stakeholders during the reporting period include:

TyPE OF STAkEHOLDER

• Clarity on company values

• Pride to work for the company

• Need for faster response by the  

Customer Service (CS) division 

in addressing complaints

• Opportunity to apply knowledge  

and skills on the job

• Divisional and departmental 

supervisors are open to feedback  

from team

• Attractive work opportunities

NeGATive

• Need to add shuttle bus within 

Bund Center Office Tower

• Maintenance of Bund Center Office  

Tower common facilities

• Business process does not fully 

encourage collaboration

• Insufficient internal communications  

on certain operational activities

• Speed of management response 

to address performance issues

BUND CENTER INVESTMENT LTD

We are planning to conduct a dedicated stakeholder engagement exercise on our material issues in 2018.  

For this 2017 report, we have mapped out the various GRI disclosures that resulted from the identified 

material issues which caused an impact towards our main stakeholders (please see table on page 41 for 

details). This map will form the basis of our stakeholder engagement exercise and the results will be published 

in our next sustainability report.

In the meantime, we strongly encourage all readers of this report to send us their feedback on the results of 

our materiality assessment or any other concerns you may have with regard to BCI’s sustainability efforts.

Please contact John Woo, Chief Risk Officer, at john.woo@bundcenter.com. We look forward to hearing

Environment





Using nature as an inspiration, the core of our design 

is to encourage social harmony and community 

engagement, providing the right balance between 

technology, nature, people and workplace.

With nearly two hectares of land encircled by four 

separate roads namely Yanan, Henan, Guangdong 

and Jian Xi, our development have incorporated 

a number of unique design features including a 

spacious garden, an internal-ring road and three 

separate vehicular access points. In addition, a three 

level underground carpark providing more than 450 

carpark lots provide ample carparks for all tenants 

and visitors to the building, including provision of car 

parks to the medical staffs of the neighborhood Renji 

Hospital (仁濟醫院) which was founded in the year 

1844, a university hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao 

Tong University School of Medicine.

ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT 

This section of the report looks at the various ways 

in which our operations impact the environment and 

lays out our commitment to minimise them. Our 

environment initiatives are focused on minimizing 

the material environmental impact of our operations, 

which include energy, water and waste. We also 

actively engage staffs and customers to champion 

and address some of the environmental impacts 

together.

Covered in this section are:

• Our efforts to improve energy efficiency and reduce

water flow in our guest rooms. This has resulted in a 

3.7% decrease in energy usage and carbon footprint 

respectively. Non-hazardous wastes rose 3.8% from 

1,044 tonnes in 2016 to 1,084 tonnes in 2017 due to 

the higher occupancy rate of our hotel, and higher 

volume of recycled items from guest rooms being 

disposed together with food wastes from our F&amp;B. 

As the average occupancy grows, it is inevitable 

that we recorded an increase by 5.9% in our year-

on-year water consumption from 2016 to 2017. We 

are addressing this trend by engaging in a number 

of on-site water efficiency initiatives, including the 

water recycling. 

This was achieved through a number of initiatives 

such as:

• Improving the water tap fittings and sensors to 

reduce overflow losses

• Manage the water consumption for cooling tower 

through water recirculation

We plan to implement regiment of water use monitoring 

to detect abnormal usage patterns by respective 

business unit weekly. We are looking forward to 

presenting in future reports how these measures are 

helping to reduce our environmental impacts.

Every little act goes a long way, even the simple acts 

of switching off lights during the lunch period and 

collecting rainwater to water plants and wash common 

areas. In addition, in compliance with the PRC 

National Health and Family Planning Commission, 

we have implemented a smoking ban from 1 March 

2017 and designated a no smoking zones at our 

buildings and deliver anti-smoking messages to our 

employees and customers. 

Moving ahead, we plan to engage a new waste 

disposal program to improve the recycling programme 

in our buildings. We have also embarked on a 

campaign to educate our guests and employees to 

not waste food and are pleased to see encouraging 

initial results. 

We do not have perfect visibility for some of the 

metrics required to properly monitor our performance 

across all the major aspects of environmental impacts. 

However, we are actively working to improve this 

and will be reporting our progress in the next annual 

sustainability report.

At BCI, we understand the significant impact 

of climate change and strive to protect the 

surrounding environment through policies and 

existing programs. To realise our commitment in 

implementing developments with an environmental 

cause, our buildings are incorporating green 

architectures to conserve energy, water and 

natural resources. All its buildings maximise 

sunlight penetration while reducing solar heat, 

thus boosting energy efficiencies, and optimising 

air circulation. Our buildings reduces air-

conditioning and lighting energy consumption 

through the use of natural lighting and outdoor 

common walkways. 

Going forward, we are exploring to obtain 

the 

Green 

Building 

Certification 

in 

our 

existing buildings. We have also embarked 

on a sustainability program with specific 

responsibilities assigned to staff across all parts 

of the organisation. Through this program, we 

will be able to better calculate and eventually 

reduce the energy required in the operation of 

our developments; lower our water consumption 

and carbon emissions and leading to better 

waste management. 

We will be disclosing our targets for this program in 

our sustainability report from FY2018 and will start 

tracking our performance against these targets 

from FY2019 onwards.

All figures in this section related solely to the two 

buildings, Bund Center Office Tower and Westin 

Bund Center. Our current system of data collection 

does not provide for separately reporting of our 

electricity and water consumption for Bund Center 

Office Tower and Westin Bund Center. Hence, 

the reported total energy consumption includes 

all activities from Bund Center Office Tower and 

Westin Bund Center.

to obtain an accreditation as an internationally recognised green standards building, the Group has 

in the meantime undertaken other initiatives to reduce consumption of energy across our buildings  

such as gradual implementation of control timing function for our air-conditioning systems,  usage of 

energy-efficient LED lightbulbs, sensor-activated lightings in common areas, sensor–activated taps

buildings is from the Shanghai Municipal Source. Our buildings 

consumed an increase of 5.9% in water consumption as compared 

to 2016 mainly due to the higher occupancy rate of our hotel and 

higher usage on public facilities within our buildings. We will continue 

to monitor carefully to minimise any water wastages and possible 

discharge of effluents into natural water systems.

Protecting the health and safety of our employees 

is a key priority and we seek to emphasise the 

importance of health and safety in the workplace and 

instil a culture of responsible, safe work practices that 

are in line with the Government’s regulations. We 

recommend, monitor and review safety procedures 

while identifying red-flagging potential risks. In 

ensuring that our practices are in line with the best 

practices of the industry, we have put in place 

Occupational Health &amp; Safety



We always ensure compliance with the Fire Protection Regulations of the PRC China. We conducted periodical fire evacuation drills at Westin Bund 

Center and Bund Center Office Tower at locations with high human traffic flows. 

reporting procedures for all accidents and injuries at 

the workplace. 

In addition, we send our employees for training 

in workplace safety and first aid in the event of 

a medical emergency. In addition, they are also 

trained in handling fire hazards at the work place, 

and participate regularly in fire drills and evacuation 

exercises. 

Our Disciplined Approach to Ensuring Occupational Health &amp; Safety

Our OHS initiatives include safety checks to ensure 

compliance by our employees and contractors; and 

the annual OHS equipment certification for compliance 

with the fire safety standards of the Shanghai Fire 

Control Bureau. We have implemented the following 

important layer of occupational health and safety 

checks to ensuring the occupational health and safety: 

1. Increased frequency of checking by the project 

Environmental Health and Safety team on daily 

and weekly basis 

2. Regular quality assurance, assessment on risk 

and control on OHS and environment by Colliers 

International.

Occupational Health &amp; Safety





Fire and hazards prevention exercise are being conducted 

four times annually with the participation of the Shanghai 

Fire Control Bureau. 

We carry out fire drills and simulation periodically to ensure 

that these procedures are understood and implemented, 

ensuring a safety culture being instilled in our operations. We 

also conduct regular trainings and awareness programs on 

health and safety for our workforce and tenants.

We take OHS incidents very seriously. All incidents are reported 

to the Safety Department, which will be included in the Monthly 

Operation Report that is submitted to Division Heads. For some 

categories of incidences, such as breakdown of equipment, 

and near misses due to negligence, an investigation report with 

follow-up actions will also be submitted to the Division Heads. 

Resulting from our continuous initiatives, we are pleased to 

report that there were no fatalities and occupational diseases 

in Bund Center Office Tower and Westin Bund Center divisions. 

There were two work-related accidents in FY2017 were 

sustained by our employees. The two injuries that involved our 

employees led to 333 lost days. Currently, we only track lost 

days and total man hours worked for our own employees and 

aim to include data on our contractors in the future. 

Also, we currently do not track our employees’ health and safety 

data by gender, and aim to include the above information by 

gender in our future reports.

reported incidents were due to human error caused by tenants or visitors. 

After each incident, a detailed investigation will be carried out. Results of 

the investigation will clearly spell out the cause and repercussions, as well 

as the follow up action undertaken to reduce the reoccurrence of such 

similar incident. The final report will be presented and discussed during the 

Monthly Operations Meeting.

supreme 

moral 

approach that is a model for everyone 

to follow. We take all incidents relating
