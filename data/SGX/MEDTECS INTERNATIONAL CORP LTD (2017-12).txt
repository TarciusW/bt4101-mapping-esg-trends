About this Report 

 

Our Commitment 

At Medtecs, we believe in the sustainable development and management of our 

business for the long term. We are excited to make available our first Sustainability 

Report for Year 2017, which we hope will give all our stakeholders a better 

understanding of our commitment to fulfilling our corporate social responsibility by 

protecting the environment and the society at large, in line with our vision and 

mission. In particular, this year we have selected certain key issues with great impact 

on our stakeholders and growth, and we have come up with corresponding policies 

and procedures that we will share later in the Report. As this is our first Sustainability 

Report, we know there is much more to be done. We have made good progress 

towards identifying sustainability risks and opportunities. We are committed to 

improved reporting for future Reports, to be published annually, which will see the 

adjustment of relevant material Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) issues, 

inclusion of more clearly defined targets, and quantitative metrics for the issues which 

will be compared against previously disclosed benchmarks. We at Medtecs see 

‘sustainability’ as more than just a buzzword. We are confident that our sustainability 

reporting and efforts, kicked off by this Report, will lead to introduction of products 

and services that will help shape a cleaner, safer and more sustainable world.

Highlights in 2017 

 

• 

Financial Results 

In 2017, we continued to focus on original product manufacturing and 3L 

business in face of fierce competition. The Group’s sales improved from higher 

demands from existing customers in 2017. Higher material and labor cost, 

primarily, have led to a slight decline in profitability in 2017. Specifically, Group 

revenues increased by 7.3% to US$61.8 million in 2017. Gross profit increased 

by 4.6% to US$9.7 million in 2017 due to higher revenues. We expect to have 

another profitable year for the Group.

Message from the Chairman 

 

It gives me great pleasure to share with you  

Medtecs’ first Sustainability Report. The reporting 

period for this Report is 1 January 2017 to 31 

December 2018, Medtecs’s financial year.  

 

As a provider of premier protective workwear, 

medical supplies and hospital support services, 

Medtecs deeply appreciates the potential risks and 

challenges faced by the healthcare professionals on a 

daily basis. We are committed to protecting their 

safety as well as the patients’, and at the same time, 

we aspire to do greater good by extending our positive contribution towards all the 

stakeholders and the communities we operate in. In the following pages, we will share 

details of our business strategies, sustainability priorities and efforts in this regard.      

 

We fully understand that the importance of the Sustainability Report lies not in the 

thoroughness of its content, but in the many steps taken in preparation of the Report, 

which have required us to examine both internal and external environmental 

challenges faced by the Group, identify possible risks, potential growth opportunities 

for the operation, and our existing business expertise and human resources so that, 

through systemic strategic planning and implementation of action plans, we are able 

to mitigate risks on the one hand and, on the other hand, to seize potential 

opportunities to create value for our employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers, 

financial institutions, communities, as well as law enforcement agencies and 

non-government organizations. 

 

Therefore, the preparation of the Report asks for participation and follow-up action 

from all our employees so that the Report generates more than just hot air and 

publicity. To that end, we have set up a Sustainability Reporting Council composed of 

officers of the highest rank from each of our offices located in Taiwan, the Philippines 

and Cambodia, the Planning Department of the Group, as well as the Chief Executive 

Officer, to facilitate and coordinate our sustainability reporting efforts. The 

supervision, support, and assistance by the Board of Directors are also indispensable, 

and engagement with all stakeholders is crucial.   

 

Through continuous dialogue and exchange of relevant information, the Council has 


































































































































 

 

11 

thoroughly examined various sustainability topics from three aspects: environmental 

protection, social welfare, and corporate governance and, depending on the current 

situation and possible future development, will focus on other key ESG issues, set 

priorities and implement relevant policies and procedures accordingly. 

 

The preparation and production of the Sustainability Report was a process of trial and 

error because we had decided not to engage an external party, but instead to tap into 

our internal resources and manpower. As a result, cross-functional communication 

between different departments, as well as vertical communication among our 

subsidiary companies, have increased in both frequency and depth, creating a positive 

impact on our team spirit. In particular, we hope the cross-cultural training provided 

as part of our staff training program will instill a sense of corporate identity and allow 

our staff members from diverse cultural backgrounds such as Taiwan, China, the 

Philippines, Cambodia and Singapore to better appreciate, respect one another and 

work together.  Such derivative benefits can not only lead to the cultivation of 

different talents, but also contribute meaningfully to the improvement of the Group's 

competitiveness. 

 

This Sustainability Report has helped generate a dynamic state of constant adjustment 

of the Group’s operations to reduce risks and seize growth opportunities to better meet 

the needs of all our stakeholders. In this regard, we have fully committed to leading 

our employees to spare no efforts in implementing initiatives to achieve the 

sustainability development goals. We will continue to improve in terms of its 

environmental, social welfare and corporate governance, so that all our stakeholders 

can feel our determination and see our contribution to the welfare of the society as a 

whole.

Governance Structure 

 

The Board of the Group oversees the Group’s sustainability reporting framework by 

monitoring the environment, social and governance issues that impact the Group’s 

sustainable development. The Group has established sub-committees of the Board, 

namely the Audit Committee, the Nominating Committee and the Remuneration 

Committee to assist the Board in the execution of its responsibilities for the protection 

and enhancement of long-term value and returns for the shareholders and 

stakeholders.  

 

In 2017, we set up the Sustainability Reporting Council made up of the Planning 

Department of the Group and senior executives, led by the Group’s Chief Executive 

Officer, which coordinates our sustainability reporting efforts and ensures the Board 

and the Group’s senior management are informed and engaged on ESG matters that 

influence our business planning, strategy and operations.

Reporting Framework and Line of Reporting 

 

The working plans for the material ESG issues will first be reviewed and approved by 

Chairman. The performance of the working plans will be reviewed twice per year, 

with due recognition and rewards for great performance given out by Chairman at the 

end of the year.  

 

Working plans, policies and procedures, target setting, performance and progress will

Materiality Assessment 

A materiality analysis enables us to define our reporting priorities, identify 

sustainability challenges and opportunities so that we can better shape our 

sustainability strategy and set goals. We have captured the resulting material issues in 

the matrix below.

Material ESG Topics 

 

After considering the list of sustainability topics covered by the GRI Standards, 

conducting the materiality analysis and taking into account the industry we operate in, 

we have decided to focus on the following 3 material ESG topics: energy and 

automation issues under the environmental topic as well as employee training and 

education, diversity and equal opportunity under the social topic.  

 

Energy  

One of our core competencies is our network of dispersed production bases. Our 

customers can hedge against residual risks through our diversification of locations, 

while enjoying tax breaks and low production costs.  Our energy costs incurred by 

the Group’s main production bases in Cambodia, the Philippines and Taiwan make up 

for about 4% of the total operational cost. Given that energy consumption and global 

warming are key issues which have prompted multilateral environmental agreements 

like the Paris Climate Accord and various policies and laws being put in place to 

regulate carbon emissions, to do our share to protect the environment and in 

compliance with relevant legal requirements, we must treat the management of our 

energy consumption and carbon footprint as a top priority.  

 

Automation   

The impact of automation is two-fold. The Group operates in a labor-intensive 

industry. As wages in our major production bases such as Cambodia and the 

Philippines have risen year after year, our labor costs have continued to climb, the 

solution to which is to increase our productivity by systematically automate our 

manufacturing processes. On the other hand, the automation process will minimize the 

negative impact our manufacturing processes have on the environment through plant 

performance improvement and reduction of energy used and resources consumed, 

which will lead to increased overall equipment effectiveness and reduction in 

operational and maintenance costs. 

 

Employee training &amp; education and workplace diversity  

Our labor costs account for 30% of the total operational costs. Our strength has 

always been our production capacity that is based in various low-cost countries. 

However, increasing labor costs in emerging markets such as Cambodia and the 

Philippines, coupled with an ageing population in Taiwan, which has seen declining 

rate of birth, are leading to a shortage of labor, which in turn is eroding this competitive 

edge. To stay competitive and profitable, we must enhance the quality of our 


































































































































 

 

18 

workforce and increase productivity. To that end, we plan to provide more staff 

training in order to grow our skilled workforce and to have a culture that’s inclusive 

and respectful of the different cultural backgrounds of our employees.  At the same 

time, our plan to implement the automation process of our production lines will help 

reduce labor costs. 

 

Others 

Our raw material expenses make up of over 40% of our total operational costs. In 

theory we should identify materials and procurement practice as materials topics we 

should focus on. However, given that most of our suppliers have worked well with us 

for a long time and there’s mutual trust established, we do not find responsible and 

dependable sourcing for raw materials a pressing issue. We will focus on our supply 

chain management in future Reports.

footprint to help address the threat of climate change and to protect the 

environment. 

2) The Group's major production bases are located in Taiwan, Cambodia, the 

Philippines and on Mainland China. The environmental laws and regulations of 

these countries have come into effect one after another, putting in place 

increasingly stricter compliance obligations and related penalties. Protecting the 

Earth has become such a shared, universal value so that we must implement 

system-wide measures to improve our energy efficiency. 

3) Out of respect for local energy laws and regulations, conditions, equipment, and 

the production flow, Medtecs (Taiwan), Medtecs (Cambodia) and Medtecs 

(Philippines), which are the Group’s top revenue generators and energy users, 

have come up with their own specific plans to improve energy efficiency after 

assessing each plan’s cost-effectiveness. 

4) The above plan will be prepared and presented annually by the end of January by 

the most senior local officer in charge, reviewed by the CEO and approved by

Office. 

 

Automation – Policy 

1) We are committed to enhancing and expanding the automation process of our 

production lines in response to increased labor costs in our production sites. 

2) The Group operates in a labor-intensive industry. As wages in our major 

production bases such as Cambodia and the Philippines have risen annually, our 

labor costs have continued to climb, increasing the cost burden of our operations. 

In response, we have found it necessary to increase our productivity by 

systematically automate our manufacturing processes.

Employee Training and Development 

Our employ training program asks for participation by all employees, regardless of 

their gender, position or location. However, our general and blue-collar workers in 

Cambodia make up for more than 80% of our workforce. To avoid skewered 

representation of our efforts, we have decided to focus on data from our offices in 

Taiwan and the Philippines only.  As shown in the figures below, our ground-level 

employees received 71% out of the total training hours; the middle management 

received 24% and the senior management, 5%. Our male and female employees 

received an equal amount of training time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Diversity of Workforce 

Medtecs (Cambodia) and Medtecs (Philippines) follow the practice of hiring local 

managers to set the standard for workforce diversity and to create synergy. Our policy 

is to hire suitable local talents and groom them for managerial position. The 

percentages of local hires occupying management positions in Cambodia and the 

Philippines are shown below.  In Cambodia, locals make up for 33% of the 

management team. In the Philippines, 88% of the management team are Filipinos, 8% 

are from Taiwan, with the remaining 4% from Mainland China.

Sustainability Targets for FY2018 onwards  

 

As this is our first Sustainability Report, our focus is on setting the right targets and 

timetable as well as identifying the right action to achieve these targets. We will report 

on progress of these targets, as well as any new targets that have been identified, in 

our next Report.  

 

Energy 

We plan to reduce the coal consumption and continue to invest in LED lighting 

conversion. Specifically we pledge to continue with phased replacement of all current 

fluorescent light tubes in the Kampong Cham factory with energy-efficient LED 

lightings by 2020.  

 

Automation 

By 2020 we plan to upgrade 1050 sets of textile equipment and install 8 sets of 

suspension system, which will help minimize downtime, increase production, reduce 

energy consumption and bring down the overall operating costs. In 2018 we will  

complete 49% of the equipment upgrade and optimization. We have now installed one 

set of suspension system. By 2020, we plan to finish installation of 8 sets of 

suspension system, reaching 100% of equipment optimization.  

 

Education and Training 

To ensure and increase effectiveness of the training program, we plan to administer 

tests to participating employees following each training session, workshop or seminar 

held in all of our facilities by the end of 2020. This practice will first be rolled out in 

2018 in our Taiwan and Philippines offices, and then in our Cambodia office and 

factories in 2019. By 2020, this practice will be followed and applied in all of our 

locations.
