About This Report 

This is HGC’s first sustainability report, which summarises the approach and performance of Environmental, Social and 

Governance (ESG) topics identified as most important to the Group and its stakeholders. 

The reporting scope covers the performance of six wholly owned hotels in Singapore, Australia and New Zealand for the 

period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 (FY2017) and wherever possible, comparative performance data for 

FY2016 has been included. We look forward to expanding the reporting scope in subsequent years as our reporting 

practice matures.  

The report has been prepared in accordance with the internationally accepted reporting framework Global Reporting 

Initiative (GRI) Standards – Core Option.

Materiality Assessment 

Through our regular assessments of stakeholder feedback and industry trends, the HGC management has gained an 

understanding of the issues that matter most to our key stakeholders which include our people, guests, investors, 

suppliers, industry players, regulators, local community and the environment. In 2017, we engaged an external 

consultant to prepare the comprehensive list of potential matters relevant to our operation, later benchmarked against 

best practices in the sector. The Senior Management assessed the impact of each matter with both internal and external 

stakeholders and prioritised six material matters for reporting. An additional matter, Employment practice was also 

chosen for reporting due to its significant impact on our operations. The material matters were subsequently endorsed 

by the Board in February 2018. The material matters will be reviewed in subsequent years to ensure their continued 

relevance to our business.

Approach to Sustainability  

 

At Hotel Grand Central Limited, we continue to refine our management approach to adapt to new global challenges 

which demand that economic players assume new responsibilities such as sharing the value they create, nurturing fair 

and equitable stakeholder relations, integrating social responsibility and environmental considerations into their 

business practices as well as the opportunities and constraints inherent to the ever-increasing digitization of the 

economy.  

We are committing to making sustainability an integral part of our business operating model. The approach taken is 

differentiated according to each sustainability matter. The Group is responsible for setting fundamental, group-wide 

policies in Corporate Governance and Human Resources. As all our hotels are locally operated, the General Manager of 

each hotel is held accountable to set relevant local targets, manage sustainability practices and track performance of 

initiatives related to data security, resource usage and health and safety. The aggregated sustainability performance at 

Group level is overseen by Ms. Tan Hwa Lian (Executive Director) who reports to the Board quarterly.  

FIGURE 3: MANAGEMENT APPROACH FOR DIFFERENT MATERIAL MATTERS

Management Approach  

Business Ethics and Anti-

Corruption 

All hotels are required to comply with the Group’s Code of Conduct and Anti-

Corruption policies. 

Employment Practices 

All hotels are required to comply with Group Workplace Diversity and 

Harassment policy and Employee Handbook. Besides common benefits, each 

hotel has specific employee benefits to adapt to local labour market conditions 

and to comply with local labour law and regulations. 

Safety of Information 

Policy on Data Safety which needs to comply with local Personal Data Protection 

Act is managed locally by hotels’ management.

Board Statement 

The Board considers sustainability matters as part of the Group’s strategic formulation. The Board together with the 

management determined six material Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) matters which have the most 

impacts on our value chain and stakeholders and exercises oversight in the management and monitoring of the 

material ESG factors.

1. Commitments to sustainability supported by strong governance 

1. Business Ethics and Anti-corruption 

 

The Group is committed to upholding the highest standards of corporate governance and bears zero tolerance towards 

any acts of corruption and other possible improprieties which include fraud, bribery and breaches of internal policies. 

Besides safeguarding our stakeholders’ interests, a good and effective governance protects our brand reputation, thus 

ensuring the sustainability of our business’ economic performance.  

In order to reinforce our stance, a Code of Conduct and related policies are included in the Employee Handbook which is 

made available to all employees within the Group upon induction. The Handbook also highlights the Group’s key 

principles of honesty, integrity, fairness and respect which are expected of employees throughout their employment.  

Each employee has to acknowledge that he/she has read and agreed to the principles and rules set out in the Handbook.  

The policies are reviewed annually by the management. Employees will be informed of any changes in a timely manner. 

Internal and external audits are also carried out annually to ensure the effectiveness of policy implementation. With 

stringent policies and control, our Group achieved zero substantiated cases of corruption and zero established incidents 

pertaining to whistle-blowing. 

Policies 

Code of Conduct 

• 

Sets out the expectations of employees to perform duties in a responsible and professional manner, promote 

and protect the reputation of our brand as well as acting appropriately when conflicts arise 

Policy on Whistle Blowing 

• 

This group-wide policy provides a channel for employees and third-parties to report in confidence, without 

fear of reprisals, concerns about possible improprieties in financial reporting or other matters 

 

2. Security of Information 

 

Maintaining confidentiality and safeguarding the privacy of our guests is paramount given the increasing threats of 

cyber-attacks and the fast changing nature of technology.  Personal data is held and used at both the group and hotel 

level. Each hotel establishes their local Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) with references to the relevant Personal 

Data Protection Act (PDPA) and Privacy Acts of the operating countries. The SOP controls how the hotels collect, use, 

disclose, store and give access to 'personal information' which include guest details, credit card information, employee’s 

personal information and vendor price agreements. Hotels are also required to comply with any record keeping law and 

credit card security standards of merchant bank. These SOPs are reviewed annually for effectiveness. 

The hotels continuously emphasise the importance of data privacy and security of information while providing training 

on best practices to all employees. People whose tasks involve the collection of personal data and information receive 

additional training as appropriate.

New Zealand 

Australia 

Singapore 

Privacy Act 1993 

Privacy Act 1988 

PDPA 2012

To prevent the misuse of information, server control and access management has been outsourced to a third-party. 

Depending on the level of confidentiality, information access is limited to designated persons-in-charge on a need-to-

know basis. We engage Information Technology consultants to provide regular upgrade on servers, email exchange 

systems and Windows Systems so that our system is up to date and able to detect or prevent new threats and minimise 

cyber risks.  

System Crash exercises will be initiated from 2019 to test the effectiveness of back up and information recovery 

procedures. External audits on general IT environment control conducted by an independent IT Manager will be 

implemented gradually and on intervals that are deemed relevant for the business. In 2017, there has been no 

substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy and losses of customer data at all of our hotels.  

2. Ensuring Fair Employment Practices 

1. Profile of our Workforce 

Our workforce remained relatively stable over the last two years, with a slight increase from 721 employees to 775 

employees in FY2017, mainly due to the increase in the number of staff employed in our Singapore hotels. Our 

workforce is gender balanced with 48% males to 52% females in FY2017.

We aim to provide stable employment for our people. In FY2017, over 97% of our employees have permanent contract 

with us. Between FY2017 and FY2016, we saw an overall a 5% increase in the number of employees joining us on a full-

time basis.

In FY2017, the employee turnover in our hotels in Australia stood at 18.8% (turnover: 145, new hires: 148). The 

Australian hospitality industry is characterised by high levels of staff turnover nationally. Our hotels perform better than 

the industry’s standard turnover benchmarks nationally. 1 

The turnover in JCHGC at 11.4% (turnover: 88, new hires: 95) is below New Zealand’s average turnover rate of 47%2. For 

employees below 30 years of age, they make up the highest turnover rate at 20.5% as they mainly apply for part-time 

 

1 The 2015 Deloitte Australian Tourism Labour Force Report commissioned by Australian Trade and Investment Commission 

recorded the annual industry turnover rates at 66%.

roles at HGC as many have no intention of staying in the industry or leave to further their studies. Employees between 

30 to 50 years of age leave our organisation due to reasons such as being offered higher positions or change in the 

industry. 

For Singapore, the turnover rates were very low at 2.8% (turnover - 22, new hires – 62), reflecting the transition of 

having a more stable permanent workforce in our Singapore hotels.

2. Employment Practices and Benefits 

 

At HGC, we practice fair employment practices that promote a culture of respect and diversity. Every employee’s career 

is important and we hope to grow and nurture each individual to reach their full potential with us. Employees are 

encouraged to develop personal development plans and work with managers to achieve their goals. Performance 

appraisals are held once at the end of the probationary period and scheduled annually thereafter. During these sessions, 

managers will discuss general performance as well as cover strengths and areas for improvements. They are also 

opportunities for employees to discuss development goals and job concerns. 

Policies  

Workplace Diversity and Harassment Policy (applicable to all hotels) 

• 

Includes strict guidelines on prevention of workplace harassment, discrimination and bullying  

• 

Covers procedures for complaints and feedback through formal and informal resolution processes

All employees are required to sign off and abide to all provisions set out in the policy.  

Dedicated to upholding the principle of equal opportunity for all employees, we ensure that all employees have equal 

access to the benefits of employment, training and promotion at HGC; regardless to race, colour, religion, age, gender, 

disability, sexual preference or other matters unrelated to work performance. The comprehensive list of employment

3. Providing a healthy and safe environment for all 

Workplace Health and Safety (WHS) is a focal topic at both corporate and hotel level due to the potential impacts on 

employees and guests as well as significant legal and financial ramifications as a result of poor management.  HGC is 

compliant with all relevant laws and regulations and we are glad to disclose that there were zero complaints regarding 

health and safety incidents received from guests in FY2017 – a record we aim to upkeep in future years.  

Australia and New Zealand 

At hotels in Australia and New Zealand, health and safety is managed by the local Health and Safety Committee which 

comprises senior management, employee representatives from each operational department, Workplace Health &amp; 

Safety Officer and Human Resources Personnel. Besides development of policies and practices, the Committee is also 

responsible for administering the incident reporting channel where employees can raise concerns or report potential 

health and safety risks at work. Every month, the Committee meets to identify, eliminate and mitigate potential hazards. 

Injury incident reports, near miss reports and other safety concerns raised will undergo review at these meetings. These 

practices help the Committee further identify any loopholes in safety measures and prevent any reoccurrences. 

Routine audits are conducted annually by both committee members and external parties on existing safety and hotel 

emergency response procedures. Improvements which were put in place in 2017 included the purchase of new 

equipment and provision of additional training on emergency responses. At JCHGC, we invested over NZ$30,000 in new 

chillers, freezers, kitchen equipment (including storage pallets and food processors) and washers.

Singapore 

In Singapore, our workplace health and safety committees work closely with key staff members such as our chefs and 

housekeeping staff to maintain an inventory of work activities and processes carried out in our hotels. Risk assessment is 

conducted for each of those activities and appropriate controls are developed for identified safety hazards. These 

assessments are reviewed every three years to ensure that our activities are compliant with the Workplace Safety and 

Health (WSH) Act stipulated by the Ministry of Manpower.  

We maintain an internal fire safety committee comprising of trained fire wardens and fire fighters and a Company 

Emergency Response Team (CERT) at both hotels. Employees, contractors, guests and visitors have access to 

whistleblowing channels administered by the Executive Director to raise any concerns on health and safety.   

Practices 

• 

Routine checks on health and safety facilities conducted twice a month  

• 

Activity-specific risk assessments are carried out once every three years to ensure that all potential hazards 

are recorded and managed 

• 

Mandatory training for internal fire safety committee on first aid and emergency response 

• 

Fire drills conducted twice a year for hotel guests and employees  

• 

Maintain appropriate fire certificates  

 

Performance 

We are pleased to announce that there were zero fatalities and occupational diseases across all three regions. Generally, 

hotels in Australia and New Zealand recorded a higher injury and lost day rate as compared to Singapore hotels as these 

hotels provide for more large-scale events and banquets. As these services are generally more fast-paced and involve a 

very dynamic set of activities, risk assessment and mitigation is a challenging task. Staff are more exposed to health and 

safety risks such as cuts, burns, sprains, slips, trips and falls.  Our local WS&amp;H committee consider this a priority and aim 

to investigate and institute control to eliminate and mitigate as many workplace hazards as possible via monthly 

meetings. 

While the management of health and safety at large events remain challenging, our hotels managed to bring down the 

number of injuries slightly in FY2017.  

In Australia specifically one of our office staff from Hotel Grand Chancellor Brisbane suffered a major back injury and 

required longer recovery time. It contributed to higher lost day rate and absentee rate in FY2017 for operations in the 

country.  

In New Zealand, while the safety statistics showed the improvement over the years, we actively work towards improving 

our performance. Based on our analysis, major risk areas in New Zealand’s hotels are in kitchen (burns, cuts, 

bruising/contusion) and in housekeeping activities (sprains, strains, cuts). To mitigate these risks, we provide safety 

manuals for our employees working in kitchen and ensure that the procedures are followed. All housekeepers are 

trained to exercise extra caution while washing glasses and to use the correct chemicals to prevent slips and falls. First-

Aid kits are strategically placed to allow for immediate treatment of minor injuries.  

In Singapore, we are pleased to report zero cases of workplace injuries in FY2016 and FY2017 – a record which we aim to 

upkeep in the years to come.

4. Managing the Use of Our Natural Resources 

 

HGC takes a proactive approach towards minimising the impact of our business on the environment and maximising 

efficient use of resources by integrating environmental-friendly practices in our day to day operations. Our environment 

policy highlights our commitment to providing great customer service whilst still meeting our environmental and social 

responsibilities through various initiatives such as waste reduction, energy efficiency improvement and the lowering 

GHG emissions. 

 

1. Energy Consumption and GHG Emissions 

 

Practices 

Australia  

(Adelaide and 

Brisbane only) 

Energy Efficiency initiatives  

• 

Replacement and upgrading of old equipment to energy-efficient ones (i.e. light 

emitting diode (“LED”) lights, chiller systems managed by Building Management System 

(“BMS”)) 

• 

Preference for higher efficiency rating electrical equipment 

 

3 Based on International Labor Organization (ILO) Standard, Injury Frequency Rate is calculated as the total number of fatal and non-

fatal workplace injuries over 1,000,000 hours multiplied by the total number of manhours worked in the reference group during the 

reporting period 

4 Based on ILO Standard, Lost Day Rate is calculated as the total number of man days lost to workplace accidents over 1,000,000 

hours multiplied by total number of manhours worked in the reference group during the reporting period. 

5 Absentee Rate is the total absentee days lost, relative to the total days scheduled to be worked by the employees in the reporting 

period, expressed as a percentage 

6 Gender breakdown is unavailable for Singapore hotels.  

7 Absentee rate is only available for Hotel Grand Central in FY2016; hence, the data for Singapore is not available for this year. We 

will collect this information moving forward.  




 

15 

 



Practices 

• 

Regular maintenance of plant and equipment to ensure operations are kept at optimum 

efficiencies 

 

Power Reduction initiatives  

• 

Use of variable-frequency drives pumps to reduce energy required to circulate water  

• 

Replacement of old electric water boilers with on-demand hot water system for hot 

water supply 

• 

Installation of motion-activated sensors at back of house areas 

• 

Use of motion-detecting thermostats and timers to operate HVAC systems 

• 

Benchmark electricity consumption per room against similar sized hotels and other HGC 

hotels 

• 

Mandatory induction training for new employees on adopting energy saving habits 

during the course of work 

 

 

New Zealand  

• 

Encourage guests to opt for ‘Green Room Service’ which leads to an overall 

conservation of resources in terms of less frequent room refresh services and 

replacement of towels 

• 

Replace and upgrade out-dated equipment to energy-efficient equipment (such as 

washing machines, dryer, air-conditioning compressor, chillers and freezers) 

 

 

Singapore  

• 

As part of our commitment towards sustainable infrastructure, all our buildings have 

received green mark certification in recognition for their environmentally friendly 

design and construction. The building design allows for the usage of natural ventilation 

wherever possible.  

• 

Increasing air-conditioning temperatures when guests are not around 

• 

Emphasising energy-saving habits such as switching off computers when not in use and 

limiting the use of other electronic appliances 

• 

Placing hot and cold drinking water dispensers that consume less electricity as 

compared to the use of a traditional kettle. 

 

 

Case Study: Keeping our hotels in check ✔ 

 

In New Zealand, renewable energy sources such as hydropower, geothermal and wind energy 

account for up to 82%8 of electricity generation in 2017. This has led us to become one of the 

lowest carbon dioxide emitting countries for electricity generation.  

 

James Cook Hotel Grand Chancellor (JCHGC) strives to be one of the most environmentally 

friendly hotels in New Zealand. We acknowledge the environmental impacts of tourism and 

have thus dedicated a ‘Green Team’ and Executive Management working closely to improve existing practices. We 

monitor all aspects of our resource consumption so as to calculate and monitor greenhouse gas emissions 

associated with our operations.  

 

 

 

 

8 Percentage of renewable share in electricity generation in 2017 was extracted from electricity statistics published by Ministry of Business, 

Innovation &amp; Employment http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/energy/energy-data-modelling/statistics/electricity 






 

16 

 



In 2017, JCHGC was EarthCheck Gold Certified and endorsed Enviro Gold by Qualmark. For the past decade, we 

have adopted EarthCheck Benchmark to analyse our energy performance and have taken 

their recommendations for further improvements.  

 

We also benchmark our operations against EarthCheck’s baseline and continuously strive to 

maintain a year-on-year declining trend. In FY2017, we recorded a decrease in 99,206 MJ 

which is equivalent to energy consumed by four typical four-person households9 per year.

Case Study: Sustainable building design: Green Mark certified hotels ✔ 

 

The Singapore BCA Green Mark Scheme was introduced in 2005 to promote more 

environmentally-friendly buildings in the construction industry in Singapore. We are 

proud to share that both our hotel buildings in Singapore have been certified under 

this scheme. 

One of the requirements for such a certification is the thermal and energy efficiency of 

our hotels. Another key indicator is the low ETTV10 of our buildings. This indicates that 

our hotels require less energy to be cooled as it does not gain as much heat from 

factors external to the building. Having good thermal properties is especially important 

to us in the context of a tropical country like Singapore where cooling our buildings 

form the bulk of energy usage. Additionally, we are working towards introducing a 

sensor-based lighting system in corridors and toilets in order to reduce the overall energy consumption of our hotels. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 Energy Consumption of a typical four-person household per year is provided in the EarthCheck data base. 

10 Envelope Thermal Transfer Value (ETTV) is an index developed by BCA to indicate the heat gain of a building from external environmental 

factors. More information about ETTV can be obtained from https://www.bca.gov.sg/PerformanceBased/others/ETTV.pdf

Fuel Consumption 

Fuel consumption include natural gas used in the kitchens of the two Singapore hotels. In New Zealand, natural gas was 

also used in the kitchen and in motor gasoline vehicles owned by JCHGC. No fuel was consumed at the three hotels in 

Australia. 

In FY2017, we recorded a total of 6,890 GJ of direct energy consumed in Singapore and New Zealand, translating to 392 

tonnes of carbon dioxide (“CO2”)11 emission. A corresponding increase in both energy intensity and Scope 1 GHG 

Emissions Intensity (per guest room) is reflected in Figure 7 below. This increase was mainly attributed to the increase in 

food covers12 resulting in a larger use of fuel in our kitchens.

Electricity Consumption  

Albeit the increase in hotel occupancy, our electricity consumption has remained constant13. We see this as an 

affirmation of the energy saving practices implemented across all six hotels. A total of 15,505 MWh of electrical energy 

 

11 Emissions disclosed here are Scope 1 GHG emissions which come from sources that are owned or controlled by Hotel Grand Central. This relates 

to diesel oil, natural gas and motor gasoline and is expressed in tonnes of CO2. Emission factors used in calculation were adopted from IPCC 

Emission Factor Database 2006 

12 Food cover refers to a diner who eats or a meal that is served 

13 Emissions disclosed here are Scope 2 GHG emissions which are a result from generation of purchased electricity consumed by the organisation.  

In Singapore, grid emission factor is obtained from “2017 Singapore Energy Statistics”, published by the Energy Market Authority of Singapore. In 

Australia, grid emission factors of South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland are used, the territories where the Australian hotels are located in. 

Data is obtained from the “Australian National Greenhouse Accounts Factors”, published by the Department of the Environment and Energy of 

Australia in 2016.  In New Zealand, grid emission factor is obtained from the “Guidance for Voluntary Corporate Greenhouse Gas Reporting – 

2016”, published by the Ministry for the Environment, New Zealand

2. Water Consumption Management 

 

Practices 

Australia  

• 

Installation of equipment with water saving features  

o Low flow showerheads 

o Dual flush and motion sensors in common toilets 

o Water flow restrictors and aerators to reduce flow rates  

o Use of water-efficient dishwashing machines 

• 

Increase awareness amongst guests  

o Green Cleaning Policy where guests can choose not to have their rooms serviced 

on a daily basis  

o Encourage guests to hang towels dry instead of replacing daily 

• 

Weekly meter readings to monitor water consumption and detect leaks or irregularities  

• 

Induction Program where new employees familiarise themselves with the Environmental 

Policy 

 

 

New Zealand  

• 

On-the-job training provided for Kitchen and Housekeeping staff on minimising water 

usage  

 

 

Singapore  

• 

Monthly review of utility bills and inspections on premises 

• 

All bathroom fittings are at least two-tick rated 

 

Case Study: Sustainable building design: Green Mark certified hotels ✔ 

 

Another criteria for the Green Mark certification lies in the water efficiency of the buildings. To that end, we have 

installed WELS14-certified fittings and cisterns to ensure optimal water use efficiency in our buildings. Additionally we 

have internal monitoring systems to detect and prevent leaks in our buildings. Finally, we only use non-potable water 

for the purpose of landscaping in our hotels.

consumers to promote water the use of water efficient system. More information on WELS can be obtained from 

https://www.pub.gov.sg/Documents/WELS_Brochure_English.pdf

Across three countries, water is withdrawn from municipal water sources. Water is used in our day-to-day hotel 

operations which includes cooking, cleaning, maintenance as well as operations of equipment. In FY2017, water 

consumption increased by 11.4% to 154,275.8 m3. This is mainly attributed to higher occupancy rates15 (Australia: 1%, 

New Zealand: 3% and Singapore: 13% increase from FY2016) and increase in food and beverage services across our 

hotels.

3. Waste Management 

 

Operating in the hospitality sector, waste generation has always been a major concern. All of the waste disposed at our 

hotels are categorised as non-hazardous waste which include general waste, cardboard, paper, plastic, glass and grease 

traps. We engage third-party contractors to assist in waste collection and disposal across all our hotels.  

Practices 

Australia  

• 

Routine checks on waste bins for proper waste segregation to limit costly collection of 

general waste bins by contractors to three times a week 

• 

Proper disposal of organic waste by third-party contractors 

• 

On-site conversion of food waste to fertiliser through Pulpmaster food waste recycling 

system 

 

 

New Zealand  

• 

Regular inspections to ensure waste management practices are implemented and 

executed 

 

 

Singapore  

• 

Where possible, paper waste generated from day to day activities is recycled by an 

external contractor 

• 

Waste generated from coffee is donated to a local organic farm for the purpose of 

reuse as compost 

• 

Water and soap dispenser systems installed to reduce plastic waste resulting from 

customer’s amenities 

 

During FY2017, we experienced an increase in waste generated by 3.2% attributed to the higher occupancy rates from 

FY2016. While there has been an increase in the quantity of waste recycled and composted (12 tonnes and 9.8 tonnes 

respectively), we continue to strive towards lowering the amount of waste diverted to landfills (in Australia and New 

Zealand) and to incineration plants (Singapore).

Case Study: Drinking water and Soap dispensers systems in guest rooms in Singapore  

 

One of the key sources of waste in the hospitality sector comes from the provision of guest amenities such 

as drinking water and toiletries. Traditionally, hotels provide these amenities in the form of disposable 

single-use plastics. In Singapore, our hotels have managed to reduce this key waste stream through the 

introduction of drinking water and soap dispensers systems across guest rooms. As a result of this practice, 

we have manage to reduce the amount of plastic wasted by 599,910 bottles in FY2016 and 709,715 bottles 

in FY201716. We will continue to look for ways to reduce waste produced from hotels in the future.

16 This number was derived by assuming savings of two bottles of drinking water per room from bottled drinking water and three smaller bottles of 

shampoo, conditioner and shower gel, multiplied by the number of bookings in a year. 




 

23 

 





 

We have received many positive reviews since the implementation of our water 

dispensers. Here are what some of our guests have to say about this! 

“The location is great, just a few steps away from Orchard Road. The best part is the hotel’s green initiative 

where a filtered-water machine is installed in your room so you have access to clean cool/warm/hot water 

anytime, saving you dollars in bottled-water purchases and also reducing your plastic bottle usage. The staff is 

also very friendly and helpful.  

– Traveller from Philippines (September 2018) 

About 15 mins walking distance to orchard road. What I liked was the water dispenser in the room! Consumption 

of water is huge especially when travelling with a young toddler.  

– Traveler from Indonesia (September 2018) 

Good basic accommodation in a central location, just opposite Somerset MRT station and within walking distance 

to shopping malls along Orchard Road. Although the hotel and rooms have very basic facilities, it has one unique 

facility that many hotels don't offer - free, unlimited supply of drinking water through a filtered machine in the 

rooms - a very good idea to minimise cost and an environmentally friendly feature, reducing use of plastic 

bottles. – Traveller from Malaysia (January 2018)
