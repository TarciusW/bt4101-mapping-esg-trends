UOL’s annual sustainability report covers performance data and related information on our  

material environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues for the period 1 January to  

31 December 2020 (FY2020).

The report covers the property development, property investments and hotel operations in Singapore, 

excluding those of listed Singland but including the common associated and joint venture companies  

of UOL Group and Singland. Singland publishes its own sustainability report, which is available on  

its corporate website. Assets and revenue from operations covered in the report comprise  

approximately 44% of the Group’s total assets and 41% of the Group’s total revenue respectively  

as at 31 December 2020. We intend to expand the scope of reporting to include our overseas operations 

when an operation significantly contributes to our assets or profit i.e. more than 10%.

This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option, and includes consideration 

of the GRI Construction and Real Estate Sector Disclosures. The report also complies with requirements of 

the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (SGX-ST) Listing Rules Practice Note 7.6 Sustainability 

Reporting Guide. Definitions and source of data measurements are indicated in Appendix B.

Data for this report is compiled via a central data management system, which was implemented during  

the year to further streamline data collection and improve accountability. As we increase transparency  

and disclosure, it is important that the growing amount of data we report is compiled efficiently and  

accurately. Having robust and comparable data is integral for us to monitor performance against targets. 

For FY2020, KPMG was engaged to provide limited assurance using Singapore Standard on Assurance 

Engagements (SSAE) 3000 to ensure alignment of the report with SGX Sustainability Reporting requirements 

under Listing Rules 711A and 711B. The assurance statement can be found on page 57 of this report.

We are committed to listening to our stakeholders. We welcome any feedback to help us improve  

our performance in sustainability and this report. Please send all feedback, questions and comments  

to Head, Corporate Communications &amp; Investor Relations, at sustainability@uol.com.sg.

Group Chief Executive Statement 

Introduction

Dear Stakeholders

The theme for this report is “Rising in Solidarity”. As the Chinese proverb goes: 人心齐，泰山移 

(Ren Xin Qi, Tai Shan Yi) - as long as we unite as one, we can overcome all difficulties.

We now live in a different world. The COVID-19 pandemic had disrupted lives and global economies in an 

unprecedented manner last year and it continues to have a profound impact on the way we live, work and play.

It is in difficult times like these that our ability to stay true to our mission and values is of utmost importance.

Putting People and Sustainability at the Core

Guided by our core values, we stepped up swiftly to implement measures to keep our key stakeholders  

safe and sustain business operations at the height of the outbreak.

We implemented split-team and work-from-home arrangements through the use of digital tools for the  

Group’s employees, to safeguard their health and safety. To protect our PPHG frontline employees,  

safe distancing measures were strictly enforced to minimise their interactions with guests. As the overall 

well-being of our people was a priority, there were regular employee engagement sessions and virtual  

mental health courses to keep them engaged and connected.

We offered rental support to tenants, including a relief package of over $50 million in rental rebates,  

when their businesses were impacted by the pandemic. The amount also included the property tax  

rebates from the government. When construction activities came to a halt for our residential projects  

during the Circuit Breaker period, we continued to pay our main contractors to help cover their overheads. 

To keep our guests safe, we rolled out the Pan Pacific Cares programme to enhance hygiene and  

sanitisation standards at all our hotels and serviced suites. We also attained the SG Clean quality mark  

for our hospitality properties.

Our community is very much part of this ecosystem, hence we placed emphasis on caring for the  

disadvantaged groups. We increased our efforts in giving support to needy students and underprivileged  

arts group, and provided over 20,000 meals to low-income families with children when their access  

to free and subsidised meals were disrupted during the Circuit Breaker period. As a tribute to our  

healthcare professionals, we sponsored shopping vouchers from our malls and complimentary stays  

at our hotels during the year to thank them for their tireless efforts.

Against the challenging backdrop, PPHG affirmed its commitment to inclusive hiring at the  

President’s Challenge Enabling Employment Pledge 2020. In 2021, we will welcome about 10 new hires, 

joining our existing talent pool of about 30 persons with disabilities in our Singapore hospitality properties.

Building a Green Future

In line with the Singapore Green Plan 2030, UOL reaffirmed its commitment to building a greener city.  

In January 2020, we launched PARKROYAL COLLECTION, a new hospitality brand, which is characterised 

by eco-friendly practices. Our PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering is an internationally-acclaimed  

green hotel, while PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay reopened in end of 2020 as a “garden in a  

hotel”. During the year, we also secured our first green loan of $120 million to redevelop Pan Pacific Orchard 

into the first zero-waste hotel in Singapore.

In our quest to rejuvenate our portfolio of assets, we received in-principle approval from the Urban 

UOL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

Introduction

Redevelopment Authority under the Strategic Development Initiative (SDI) scheme to redevelop Faber  

House, a commercial property, into a 250-key green hotel that will add vibrancy to Orchard Road.  

We will also be redeveloping 333 North Bridge Road and part of Odeon Towers into a standalone  

seven-storey office building. The new building will feature biophilic design elements such as garden  

terraces and vertical greenery.

For our existing commercial and hospitality properties, we continue to incorporate green features  

where feasible, and make them environmentally friendly through maintenance and retrofits. Early  

this year, United Square received Green Mark GoldPlus certification. Such efforts are aligned with  

the government’s plan to achieve at least 80% of all buildings in Singapore to be Green Mark  

certified by 2030. I am happy to share that UOL was recognised as BCA Green Mark Champion 2020  

for attaining a substantial number of Green Mark buildings at Gold level or higher.

Sustainability Performance in 2020

During the year, the Group set short- and long-term goals for the reduction of GHG emissions across  

our properties. Our commercial properties aim to achieve a 0.9% reduction of absolute GHG emissions  

for 2021 (base year: 2019) and 25% reduction of GHG emissions intensity by GFA occupied by 2030  

(base year: 2010). Our hospitality properties set a target to achieve 2.4% reduction of absolute  

GHG emissions for 2021 (base year: 2019) and a 30% reduction of GHG emissions intensity by guest  

night by 2030 (base year: 2013). 

In 2020, we recorded non-standard energy, water and waste data compared with pre-pandemic levels,  

due to the disruptions to our operations brought on by COVID-19. The Group remains on track to  

achieving our long-term 2030 environmental targets. We will continue to identify opportunities to  

increase resource efficiency.

We maintained a good safety record at the workplace in 2020 with no fatalities. In order to maintain  

high standards of occupational health and safety standards across all our operations, we strive for  

zero incidents at the workplace.

The hospitality sector was the hardest hit with travel restrictions in place globally. But we leveraged  

the downtime and government job support schemes to enhance the skill sets of our employees  

from PPHG. During the year, the training hours of our hospitality group doubled year-on-year to an  

average of 119 training hours per employee. We will continue to ensure we meet our employees’  

training needs.

Sustainability is Our Commitment

We have developed a sustainability framework that communicates our strategies in addressing a range  

of ESG challenges such as climate change and business conduct. Our corporate culture is a core part  

of these strategies. We will continue to innovate and leverage technology to build a better environment  

and create more value for our stakeholders and future generations.

We would like to thank our employees, business partners, customers and community for their support  

of UOL’s efforts throughout our sustainability journey. Building on our strong foundation, we will  

continue to work together with our stakeholders to steer towards a sustainable future.

Five-Year Sustainability Performance

Introduction

1 

Some 2019 figures have been restated due to the exclusion of tenant electricity consumption data and tenant GFA from our hospitality  

properties. GRI 102-48

2 

Group GFA changes from time to time. The change in 2020 is due to the inclusion of PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, which was in operation 

for three months in 2020 and was closed for major renovations from March to November 2020. 

3 

Completed buildings refer to completed properties in Singapore, including retail, mixed developments, offices, hotels and serviced suites.

4 

As of FY2020, we now report our safety data in accordance with the GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018 Standard. We no longer report 

previous years’ Accident Frequency Rate and Accident Severity Rate, as the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has stopped disclosing the industry  

figures since 2019.

retrofits. We deploy robot cleaners in United Square and KINEX to increase resource efficiency and avail 

manpower for other needs, such as disinfection of areas in the buildings. 

Our hospitality business launched the PARKROYAL COLLECTION brand in January 2020, where hotels 

are characterised by eco-friendliness and sustainability. This brand is led by the multiple award-winning 

PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering and the newly opened PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay,  

which is BCA Green Mark Gold-certified. The latter is fitted with low-emissivity glass that lets in natural  

light while minimising solar heat and ultraviolet rays, as well as recycling bins in every guest room,  

among others. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has had extensive and adverse impact on businesses globally. In 2020, our  

hotel operations were affected significantly due to international travel restrictions. Our shoppers’ footfall 

faced challenges due to the Circuit Breaker period and ongoing safe distancing measures. Our development  

projects experienced manpower shortages and project delays as construction work came to a halt in  

Singapore at the peak of the outbreak. As a result of these disruptions, our businesses recorded  

non-standard energy, water and waste data in 2020 compared with pre-pandemic levels. 

Building Energy Consumption and GHG Emissions

UOL recognises the challenges of climate change action and our responsibility to do our part by reducing  

the carbon footprint of our properties. As a demonstration of our commitment to mitigate the impact of  

climate change, we have set targets for GHG emissions reductions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) for both our 

commercial and hospitality properties. Their GHG emissions intensity reduction targets are the same  

as the respective energy intensity reduction targets because the large bulk of energy consumption is  

from electricity. 

Our commercial and hospitality properties also set short-term targets for reductions in energy and  

water consumption and GHG emissions for 2021. Our annual short-term targets will be reviewed  

regularly to keep up to date with the latest developments.

In 2020, the Group’s energy consumption and GHG emissions were 106,695 MWh and 42,747 tonnes  

of CO2 equivalent respectively, which represented reductions of 1.3% and 4.9% respectively, compared 

with 2019. Building energy includes electricity consumption from the grid, cooling consumption, piped  

gas and diesel used on-site. While energy intensity and GHG emissions intensity decreased at most  

of our buildings, our serviced suites recorded increases compared with 2019, given the lower occupancy 

rates due to the COVID-19 pandemic.7 We remain on track to achieving our long-term targets. Our  

commercial properties recorded a 23.0% reduction of energy intensity by GFA occupied and a 38.5%  

reduction of GHG emissions intensity by GFA occupied, with 2010 as the base year, while our hospitality 

properties recorded a 13.9% reduction of energy intensity by guest nights and a 20.6% reduction of  

GHG emissions intensity by guest night, with 2013 as the base year.

Given the nature of their operations, our hotels have the highest energy and water consumption,  

and are the largest contributor to the Group’s building energy and water consumption. Our hospitality  

business has been consistently implementing initiatives to improve operational and resource efficiency,  

such as through installing Building Management Systems and other energy- and water-saving  

equipment. We continue to seek opportunities to help us achieve our targets, through digitalisation chiller 

optimisation and retrofitting.

5 

Given the different nature of our businesses, the normalisation factors used in our energy intensity and water intensity targets for our commercial 

properties and hotel operations are GFA occupied and guest nights respectively. The intensity data for the Group is reported on a by GFA basis in 

Appendix A.

6 

Short-term targets for 2021 were based on projected absolute consumption rather than intensity, as intensity denominators (GFA occupied and  

number of guest nights) were expected to continue experiencing significant fluctuations with the evolving pandemic situation and related regulations.  

2019 was used as the base year as 2020 performance data was impacted due to the pandemic. Given the unprecedented times, we are reviewing 

internal intensity metrics in line with the new normal.

7 

While occupancy rates decreased due to the pandemic, energy was still used to provide lighting and ventilation for building occupants’ comfort.  

As energy intensity is based on energy consumed by guest nights and by GFA occupied, this resulted in higher energy intensities of serviced  

suites in 2020.

The Group’s building water consumption was 678 megalitres. Water used at all our properties is from  

municipal sources and discharged into public sewers, in accordance with local regulations.

We recognise that robust water management is important to enhance the efficiency and resilience of our 

properties. We regularly track our water consumption, review water management plans and implement 

water-saving features where areas of improvement are identified. For instance, Novena Square is currently 

undergoing upgrades to install water-saving taps and flushing systems.

In 2020, our commercial properties recorded a 36.1% reduction of water intensity by GFA occupied  

with 2010 as the base year. Our hospitality properties recorded a 30.4% reduction of water intensity  

by guest night with 2013 as the base year. While most of our buildings recorded decreases in water  

intensity, our serviced suites recorded an increase in water intensity compared with 2019, given the  

lower occupancy rates due to the COVID-19 pandemic.10

During the year, we had six ongoing development projects, namely Amber45, Avenue South Residence, 

Clavon, MEYER HOUSE, The Tre Ver, and Pan Pacific Orchard.

In 2020, total energy consumed at our development projects was 2,848 GJ. Energy consumed mainly comes 

from electricity and diesel use. 

Total GHG emissions was 2,551 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, with a breakdown of 2,227 tonnes and  

323 tonnes from Scope 1 and Scope 2 respectively. The GHG intensity by value of work completed was 

19.2 kg of CO2 equivalent per thousand dollars.

Total water consumption, which is from municipal sources, was 77.4 megalitres in 2020. Water used  

is discharged via public sewers or public drains, in accordance with local regulations. We reduce water  

usage at our development projects by using wastewater from construction activities to wash trucks 

and other vehicles before they leave the construction sites, to minimise pollution to public road surfaces.

All our main contractors undertaking our projects in 2020 were certified to ISO 14001. They were also 

awarded the Green and Gracious Builder certification.

Energy Consumption and GHG Emissions for Corporate Office

The Group’s corporate office is located within one of our commercial properties. In 2020, our corporate  

office used 243.2 MWh of energy, a decrease from 316.7 MWh in 2019. GHG emissions also decreased  

by 25.1% from 133 tonnes of CO2 in 2019 to 99 tonnes of CO2 in 2020. 

Waste and Resource Management

In 2020, the Group generated a total of 5,553 tonnes of waste. We recorded 5,199 tonnes of waste 

disposed, with a breakdown of 2,849 tonnes and 2,350 tonnes from our commercial properties and  

hospitality properties respectively.

Building waste intensity by GFA occupied was 13.0 kg/m2, a 39.7% decrease from 2019. 

Our commercial properties and hospitality properties also sent 300.2 tonnes and 54.3 tonnes of waste  

for recycling respectively. 

In 2020, our hospitality business pledged support for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)’s Plastic ACTion 

(PACT) initiative. Water filters in the taps of guest rooms were installed at some of our hotels for guests  

to obtain drinking water directly from taps, thus eliminating the need for plastic bottles. This feature  

will be progressively rolled out to the rest of our hospitality properties. In addition, plastic straws,  

plastic bottled water and several in-room amenities were removed from our hotels. Our goal is to  

eliminate all single-use plastic from our hotel operations in 2021.

In February 2021, the Singapore government declared 

climate change a global emergency and a threat to 

mankind. In the same month, the government unveiled 

the Singapore Green Plan 2030, a “whole-of-nation” 

movement to advance sustainable development. 

Key goals of the Singapore Green Plan 2030  

include greening 80% of all buildings and creating  

more green spaces, among others. 

UOL has been a supporter of the government’s  

vision for a liveable and sustainable Singapore. We 

are conscientious in reducing our environmental 

impact through managing our energy and water 

consumption, 

including 

their 

reduction 

targets 

and GHG emissions reduction targets. To achieve 

our targets, we continuously invest in innovation, 

conduct ongoing maintenance and retrofitting, and 

install other energy- and water-saving equipment  

to optimise resource efficiency. We also do our  

part to reduce waste and increase recycling. All  

single-use plastic straws and plastic bottled water  

have been eliminated from our hospitality properties 

since 2019.

An Advocate of Green Initiatives 

Sustainability and green architecture have always been the hallmark of UOL’s development projects.  

UOL has completed many projects that place strong emphasis on green features such as PARKROYAL 

COLLECTION Pickering and PARKROYAL on Kitchener Road, which have won BCA Green Mark Platinum 

awards. UOL hopes such efforts will serve as green prototypes to make Singapore a sustainable city.  

We are setting a new benchmark through the redevelopment of Pan Pacific Orchard, which was  

awarded BCA Green Mark Platinum and will be the first zero-waste green hotel in Singapore. The  

Group also secured our first green loan of $120 million to partially finance the redevelopment of the hotel. 

For our sustainability efforts, the Group was recognised as a Green Mark Champion in 2020 by BCA.  

This award is Singapore’s highest environmental certification recognising developers with excellent 

achievements in environmental sustainability and strong commitment towards corporate social 

responsibility, and requires developers to have a substantial number of Green Mark buildings at Gold 

level and higher. To date, more than 10 of our Singapore properties have been recognised by the  

BCA Green Mark scheme.

UOL actively engages with the government, industry associations and peers to advance sustainability  

in the real estate sector. We were a Silver Sponsor for BCA’s International Built Environment Week 

2020 and a member of the Singapore Green Building Council. In March 2021, our Pan Pacific Orchard 

was featured in an informative video by the Ministry of National Development, which highlighted  

the national targets of the Singapore Green Building Masterplan to make the urban environment  

more green and sustainable. 

We endeavour to continue leading by example with our initiatives in greening urban habitats and  

improve lives.

At UOL, we are committed to delivering quality products and services to our stakeholders, with a focus  

on customers, innovation and sustainability practices.

We require all our development projects to be certified to the Construction Quality Assessment  

System (CONQUAS) by BCA. We continue to build on the success of our completed project, The 

Clement Canopy, by using innovative technologies such as PPVC for our current development project,  

Avenue South Residence. This building technology not only improves the quality of our buildings, but  

also creates positive environmental and social impacts such as improved workers’ safety and reduced  

dust and noise at construction sites.

We believe good buildings add value not just to the property but also to the quality of life. Our 

latest development project, Clavon, is a next-generation product designed in response to changing  

lifestyles, incorporating work-from-home elements, smart home features and technology solutions to  

ensure a safe living environment. 

UOL values the strong relationships and mutual trust we have built up with our contractors  

over the years. In 2020, the construction industry faced a series of challenges due to the pandemic.  

We remained committed to supporting our contractors as they faced labour shortages and persistent  

project delays. We continued to keep to the payment schedule even when on-site work was  

suspended by the government during and after the Circuit Breaker period. We proactively engaged  

with our contractors and assured them of our support, even before the government enacted the  

COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act. 

In our hospitality business, employee development and training is a key factor in the provision of  

service excellence. We closely monitor in-house guest satisfaction surveys and external reviews on  

multiple platforms, and benchmark our performance via an external Quality Assurance specialist.  

We also invest in new technologies and management systems to enhance service quality, such as  

the installation of room control units in our hotels, which drives energy efficiency and perform proactive 

maintenance, and enables guests to enjoy personalised comfort and convenience. In 2020, we maintained 

guest satisfaction scores of 80% and above across all our hotels.

The pandemic has also changed the way businesses engage customers, who are spending more  

time online due to safe distancing measures. The Group responded quickly to the changing  

landscape and adapted our digital marketing strategies across our businesses. With our latest 

development project Clavon, the Group held a virtual sales launch for the first time. We continued  

to engage prospective buyers through the rollout of virtual showflats for our other launched  

projects, Avenue South Residence and Amber45. We held our first UOLive-eGSS livestream  

event across our three malls in September 2020 as part of the virtual Great Singapore Sale,  

where retailers showcased products with exclusive deals. On the hospitality front, our hotels  

hosted interactive virtual events such as wedding fairs, wine tasting, and cocktail and cooking 

classes. We also launched EzyMeet, a virtual meeting package inclusive of refreshments  

and stationery, to cater to customers conducting virtual meetings.

Social

Workplace Safety for Hospitality Business

Our employees’ safety at work is a key priority to us. This focus on safety and health has become  

particularly heightened with the onset of the pandemic. 

We were one of the first few hospitality groups in Singapore to have our hotels serve as Government 

Quarantine Facilities and house guests who were on Stay-Home Notice. We worked closely with  

government agencies and maintained round-the-clock communication with the guests to coordinate 

monitoring and management of guests for their safety and the safety of our staff. To protect our frontline 

staff who serve these guests, interactions with guests have been greatly reduced, and done so at a distance 

with limited contact. Staff conducting check-ins don a full set of personal protective equipment, while  

all meals and linen replacements are placed outside guests’ room doors.

In 2020, there were 41 recordable work-related injuries for our hospitality business compared with  

42 work-related injuries in 2019. The rate of recordable work-related injuries was 12.08 per million  

hours worked.

Food Safety and Hygiene

Food safety is fundamental to the well-being of our hotel guests.

Our comprehensive Food Safety Management System (FSMS) includes extensive food safety training  

along with external audits along the entire food chain, from receipt of raw produce, preparation to  

delivery. The FSMS serves to enhance our existing procedures and helps cultivate best-practice in our  

food safety culture.

Our hotels maintained our track record for food safety. A marginal number of cases were reported  

and thoroughly investigated with laboratory tests, where possible. No indications of contamination were 

found in any of the samples in 2020.

UOL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

Safety and Security of Building Occupants

The safety and well-being of our guests, shoppers, tenants and building occupants are important to us. 

Our hospitality business responded swiftly to the pandemic with the rollout of the Pan Pacific Cares  

programme, which is our commitment to ensure the safety and welfare of our guests and employees 

through heightened levels of hygiene and sanitisation. Under this initiative, our hotels implemented  

various measures required by local government authorities and elevated protocols recommended by  

the World Health Organization. We partnered with established healthcare and infection prevention  

specialist Diversey to introduce best-in-class cleaning and infection prevention solutions across our  

hotels. In addition to standard protocols such as safe distancing, thermal scanning and contactless  

payment, elevated measures included deep cleaning of our properties with the fully biodegradable,  

healthcare grade Oxivir disinfectant, five-fold increase in cleaning frequency, and using ultraviolet lights 

to inspect all disinfected and sanitised guestrooms. For additional safety, all guests receive a care  

pack comprising surgical masks, hand sanitisers and disinfectant wipes upon check-in. 

All of our hotels and serviced suites have also obtained the SG Clean quality mark, a certification that the 

properties meet government-stipulated sanitation and hygiene standards. 

There were no substantiated issues concerning guests’ physical safety and security in 2020.

Our commercial properties also ramped up on health and safety measures. We kept our tenants  

informed of government advisories and measures implemented by building management via circulars.  

We installed acrylic shields at customer service and reception counters, increased disinfection  

frequency, and applied antimicrobial coating to high-touch points such as lifts to further reduce  

transmission risk through contact with contaminated surfaces. We also introduced an online food  

ordering platform to provide convenience to shoppers and reduce physical contact, while boosting  

sales of our food and beverage tenants.

Incident Reporting

In 2020, we recorded 50 injuries across all of our buildings as compared with 160 injuries reported in  

2019. This number included guests, tenants and visitors, as well as employees and contractors in our 

commercial properties, hotels and serviced suites.

Our people are our greatest asset. We employed about 2,000 people in Singapore in 2020; the vast  

majority (over 90%) are employed in the hospitality business. Our turnover rates for the property and  

hospitality businesses remain below the respective national industry averages every year. The  

turnover rate of the property business increased from 16.9% in 2019 to 18.9% in 2020, while the  

turnover rate of the hospitality business increased from 27.4% in 2019 to 31.2% in 2020. As part of  

efforts to protect employees and livelihoods during this global crisis, pay cuts were applied only  

to the Group’s Senior Management in 2020. 

 

Throughout this pandemic, our people have displayed agility, resilience and dedication to their jobs.  

When Singapore raised the DORSCON level to Orange in February 2020, the Group responded swiftly  

to implement safe distancing measures and organise employees into split teams to minimise  

disruptions to business operations. In April 2020, when the Circuit Breaker period began, our  

employees quickly adapted to working from home. When some of our hotels experienced manpower  

shortages due to border closures, corporate staff voluntarily helped out with the operations and  

housekeeping in the hotels. 

During the year, the Group prioritised employee well-being and stepped up on communication and  

engagement with employees. All employees received care kits with items such as masks for protection. 

Especially for the hospitality business where the employees have more interactions with guests and 

customers, disposable masks are replenished monthly for them. Engagement and health talks to  

support the mental well-being of our employees to adapt to new habits like remote working were  

also organised by the Group. In addition, the property business adopted telemedicine and an Employee 

Assistance Programme, which provides a confidential hotline with a healthcare provider to support  

employees’ mental and emotional well-being. 

The Group recognises the importance of maintaining employee engagement even as a large proportion  

of communications has shifted online. The Senior Management engaged employees regularly through  

virtual townhall meetings, engagement sessions and Intranet to provide timely updates about the  

company and keep employees motivated. 

The Group recorded an absentee rate of 4.7% in 2020 (3.6% in 2019), or roughly an average of 12.22  

days of sick leave per employee, based on a five-day work week. The absentee rate of our property  

business was 1.4% while that of our hospitality business was 5.0%.

Diversity and Inclusion

We believe in the importance of diversity and inclusivity. A diverse work environment will enrich our  

perspectives and attract high-calibre candidates from the widest talent pool. Our workforce consists of  

22 nationalities across the Group.

We value gender diversity and believe we have a responsibility to contribute to a fair and productive society. 

We ensure commitment towards equal opportunities at all levels of the organisation. In our property 

business, 50% of Senior Management were female compared with 46% in 2019. In our hospitality business, 

50% of Senior Management of our various business units were female compared with 43% in 2019.

We seek to foster a supportive environment for employees with children and dependents. We offer paternity 

leave to working fathers whose children are not Singapore citizens, even though paternity leave is only  

applicable to employees whose children are Singapore Citizens, under MOM’s regulation.

We recognise mature and experienced employees as assets to our organisation and promote the  

redeployment of retiring workers into the business. As at 31 December 2020, 25.9% of employees in  

our property business and 24.4% of employees in our hospitality business were above the age of 50.

PPHG is a pioneer of inclusive hiring in Singapore’s hospitality sector. We hire about 30 persons with  

disabilities (PWDs) across our Singapore properties, and collaborate with SG Enable to offer on-site  

training opportunities to PWDs. As we expand our talent pool of PWDs and formulate a career retention 

strategy for them, some of our employees were sent for a certification programme with SG Enable to  

equip them with the skills and knowledge to take on coaching responsibilities.

On 11 March 2020, in conjunction with the President’s Challenge 2020, PPHG launched the central  

kitchen programme at the Enabling Village, an integrated community space that provides services for 

PWDs. President Halimah Yacob was the guest-of-honour. Partnering social service agency Extra•Ordinary 

People and social enterprise Samsui Kitchen, the programme is designed to address manpower  

challenges in the culinary team while enabling employment for PWDs. The central kitchen initiative  

supplies dim sum items to restaurants under PPHG. At the same event, PPHG made a pledge to commit to 

inclusive hiring through the President’s Challenge Enabling Employment Pledge launched by the President.

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions imposed on physical gatherings, UOL took the 

opportunity to build organisational capabilities in agility and resilience, as well as to accelerate digital 

awareness. In addition, we worked with vendors to redesign training programmes so that the course  

activities and discussions could be offered virtually, albeit in a much shortened duration. This led to  

an average of 10.4 training hours per employee during the year.

Our hospitality business utilised the downtime during the pandemic to upskill and reskill employees,  

with the support of government training grants and vendors’ increased provision of physical  

training in virtual format. We sent about 60% of our local employees for SkillsFuture courses to  

enhance their skill sets, leveraging government grants such as the Enhanced Training Support  

Package (ETSP) and the Place-and-Train Program for Hotel Industry (PnT). In 2020, our hospitality  

business also launched an e-learning academy, U@Pan Pacific, offering over 160 academic courses  

and 12 professional certifications to provide continuous development opportunities for all employees  

through online learning. As a result, our hospitality business delivered 119.0 average training hours  

per employee in 2020. Overall, the Group recorded 109.9 average training hours per employee in 2020,  

an increase from 54.2 hours in 2019.

We have set new targets for our property and hospitality businesses’ average training hours per employee 

in 2021. This is in view of the ongoing pandemic, where employees’ training will largely continue to be 

conducted virtually.

It is our duty as a responsible business to give back to the society in which we operate. We focus  

our community efforts on children, youth, education, sports and the arts. Our community initiatives  

include donations, in-kind donations and staff volunteerism to deliver meaningful impact. Not only do 

these initiatives help the local community, but they also help to build team bonding and collaboration in  

the Group.

In spite of the challenging business environment in 2020, we continued to extend care and support to  

the community and groups affected by the pandemic.

The Group believes in investing in the education of future generations. To ensure that learning was  

not disrupted during this period, we stepped up on our efforts to support beneficiaries like Care Corner  

Student Care Centre, Institute of Technical Education and Ngee Ann Polytechnic. We provided  

financial assistance through bursaries to help the needy students to cover their programme fees, 

transport and meals. We also continued our partnership with the Singapore University of Technology and  

Design (SUTD) to support local students from the Architecture and Sustainable degree programme  

under the UOL Group – SUTD Scholarship. In a joint effort with PPHG, the Group provided over 20,000  

meals to low-income families with children, when their access to free or subsidised meals in schools  

were disrupted during the extended Circuit Breaker period in May 2020. 

In 2020, the Group was conferred the Patron of the Arts award by the National Arts Council, mainly for 

supporting disadvantaged arts groups and special needs communities in the local arts scene. During  

the year, UOL continued to support Very Special Arts Singapore by helping to defray its operating costs 

when fund-raising activities proved challenging during the difficult year. UOL’s three malls also partnered 

with Extra•Ordinary People, a charity which supports youth with special needs, to enable shoppers  

to redeem exclusive premiums of art pieces created by the trainees from the Cerebral Palsy Alliance 

Singapore. We also gave royalty fees to the trainees to support their journey ahead. 

We extended our care to other vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in 2020. To show our support  

to migrant workers who had been impacted by the pandemic, our hotel pastry chefs baked 600 bread  

rolls for workers residing at Kranji Lodge 1. At the height of the pandemic, Pan Pacific Perth in Australia  

was one of the first to open its rooms to shelter the homeless. 

To appreciate healthcare workers for their hard work and sacrifice, UOL gave away $40,000 worth of  

shopping and dining vouchers redeemable at United Square and Velocity@Novena to those working in 

Health City Novena. Under PPHG’s Healthcare Employees Recognition &amp; Ovation (HERO) initiative,  

frontline healthcare workers from three national healthcare groups were given 25,000 complimentary  

stays at the Group’s five hotels in Singapore. In partnership with the Ministry of Culture, Community  

and Youth, PPHG also provided meals to 500 healthcare workers in Alexandra Hospital, Ng Teng Fong  

General Hospital and KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. 

PPHG participated in the inaugural #SeeItBlue movement which was part of the global #MakeItBlue  

campaign to thank frontline healthcare workers for their sacrifices during the pandemic. Together with  

other iconic buildings in Singapore, our hotel facades were lit up in blue every Thursday evening from May 

to June 2020.

Beyond donations and campaigns, we sought out business opportunities that allowed us to also  

support small local businesses. We worked with them to design staycation packages with customised 

experiences to capture domestic market demand. For example, PARKROYAL on Beach Road, located in 

the culturally rich precinct of Kampong Glam, partnered with small local businesses in the vicinity to curate 

experiences that showcase the different facets of Singaporean culture and heritage. 

The Group actively encourages employees to volunteer their time to serve the community. During the 

Christmas festive season, UOL volunteers packed and delivered goodie bags to 140 residents of the  

AWWA Senior Community Home to bring them some cheer. PPHG also participated in Community Chest’s 

Fú Dài 2020, where volunteers packed and distributed festive bags to vulnerable seniors and families. 

For the Group’s ongoing community efforts, UOL and PPHG were each named as Champion of  

Good 2020, which is a national recognition award by the National Volunteer &amp; Philanthropy Centre  

(NVPC) for corporate giving and engaging stakeholders on a collaborative giving journey. The Group  

also pledged our support to NVPC’s SG Cares Giving Week, a national movement to encourage  

individual giving. UOL shared our giving stories and helped raise the campaign’s awareness on our  

malls’ social media platforms, while PPHG volunteers delivered a desk bell performance with some  

beneficiaries at the campaign’s closing performance.





UOL contributed to Care Corner Student Care Centre’s bursary  

fund so that the needy students could continue to attend the  

after-school care programme.

Enterprise Risk Management

Governance

The Board has overall responsibility for the governance of risk. To pursue a sustainable long-term growth 

path, the Board recognises the importance of, and is responsible for, ensuring that Management 

designs, implements and monitors a sound system of risk management and internal controls as part of 

good governance. The Audit and Risk Committee (“ARC”) assists the Board in carrying out the Board’s 

responsibilities of overseeing the Group’s risk profile, and the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk 

management framework and policies, as well as the internal control system. 

At the Management level, the Group Risk Management Committee (“GRMC”), chaired by the Group 

Chief Executive and comprising the Senior Management staff from both the property and hospitality 

businesses, reports to the ARC on a half-yearly basis or more frequently as needed. The GRMC highlights 

significant risk issues, both existing and emerging, for discussion with the ARC and the Board, taking 

into account the immediate operating environment and the next half-year prospects. In addition, the

GRMC oversees the direction, implementation and running of the enterprise-wide risk management

across the Group.

The Group has established an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) Framework, which aims to increase 

the confidence in the Group’s strategies, businesses and operations, through assurance that key risks 

are properly and systematically addressed. For a comprehensive risk identification and assessment, 

an integrated top-down and bottom-up risk review process is in place. Business functions undertake 

and perform their self-assessment of key risks and mitigating measures, which are aggregated for 

reporting. The GRMC examines them, in conjunction with the Group’s top tier risks and deliberates on 

any potential significant threats at both the strategic and operational level. New or emerging concerns 

highlighted from these forums are addressed in consultation with business owners for further 

assessment and follow up actions. This ongoing dialogue with relevant stakeholders facilitates a more

robust and relevant ERM within the Group.

Management sets the appropriate tone at the top and continuously reinforces the “risk-aware” 

culture within the Group. With the belief that risk management is every employee’s responsibility, 

Management works towards embedding risk management principles in the day-to-day decision-

making and business processes. To promote risk awareness and enhance risk management knowledge, 

Senior Management staff in both the property and hospitality businesses actively participate in regular 

ERM discussions, training and workshops to acquire and maintain an adequate understanding of ERM 

concepts, methodologies and tools to enable them to manage risks in their respective areas of work.

Governance

Code of Business Conduct

Our Code of Business Conduct (CBC) sets out expectations of employees in relation to issues such  

as fraud, bribery, conflicts of interests, anti-competitive conduct, harassment, health, safety and 

environment. It directs employees to consult their Heads of Department or Human Resource  

representatives in case of queries or issues. All employees are required to review and affirm their  

compliance with the CBC annually.

Anti-corruption and Anti-bribery 

UOL adopts a zero-tolerance stance towards fraud and corruption.

All new hires are briefed on the CBC, which states our firm position against fraud and corruption. The  

Board, through its Audit &amp; Risk Committee (ARC), has in place processes to monitor and address any  

fraud or corruption issues. For contracts with key suppliers and contractors, they are required to  

acknowledge that UOL does not tolerate corruption and/or fraud and they shall comply with all applicable 

laws and regulations.

The Internal Audit (IA) department assesses all company departments for the risk of corruption and bribery.

Whistle-blowing Policy

In relation to the CBC, a whistle-blowing policy is in place to encourage and provide a channel for  

employees and external parties dealing with employees to report, in good faith and confidence, concerns 

about possible fraud, improprieties in financial reporting and other matters. Contact details of the Head, 

Group Internal Audit are disclosed on the corporate website. He is responsible for investigating any concerns 

raised and reporting findings to the ARC, independent of Management.

Data Protection

The Personal Data Management Framework comprises policies and processes that cover the lifecycle  

of each personal data type within UOL. It also defines the roles and responsibilities of the people to 

manage personal data properly. To develop a sustainable Personal Data Management Framework, the  

policies and processes undergo regular review and update, while personal data related communications  

and trainings are conducted on an ongoing basis.

The Data Protection Policy, which is available on our 

corporate website, sets out how UOL collects, uses 

and discloses personal data of various parties dealing 

with the company. It adheres to the provisions set 

out in the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act. 

Additionally, in the hospitality sector, we recognise the 

responsibility that comes with collection of personal 

and financial data, such as online reservations, rewards 

programmes and credit card transactions. Robust 

security procedures are put in place to enhance data 

protection.

Economic Performance

UOL recognises the interconnectivity that we have with many different stakeholders and operates  

responsibly in the economy. 

During the year, we engaged our shareholders and the investment community virtually through various 

platforms such as the Annual General Meeting, earnings calls, post-results luncheons, conferences  

and one-on-one meetings. In 2020, the Group provided operational updates including the impact of  

the pandemic on the Group’s business in the first quarter and third quarter of the year.

Appendix B:  

Notes for Sustainability Performance Data

General

1.  

Buildings

 

Mixed Developments: Novena Square and United Square

 

Offices: Faber House and Odeon Towers

 

Retail: KINEX

 

Hotels: PARKROYAL on Beach Road, PARKROYAL on Kitchener Road, PARKROYAL COLLECTION 

Pickering (former PARKROYAL on Pickering), PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay and Pan Pacific 

Singapore. PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay was in operation for three months in 2020 and 

closed for major renovations from March to November 2020. Pan Pacific Orchard was excluded as  

it was closed for redevelopment on 1 April 2018.

 

Serviced Suites: PARKROYAL Serviced Suites Beach Road, Pan Pacific Serviced Suites Beach Road, 

and Pan Pacific Serviced Suites Orchard.

2.  Development projects: Refers to construction and redevelopment activities that took place in  

Singapore, including joint ventures with Singland.

3.  Corporate office: Refers to electricity consumption at UOL’s corporate office, based on utility bills. 

Water data is unavailable, as water is not separately metered. Our corporate office sits in United  

Square and forms a subset of the building energy and water figures reported.

Environment

4.  Coverage within building: Data from tenants is excluded for all properties. 

5.  District Cooling: The BCA Energy Benchmarking Report excludes properties with district cooling,  

which can form a significant part of the energy consumption. Pan Pacific Singapore and PARKROYAL 

COLLECTION Marina Bay use district cooling technology.

6.  GFA and GFA occupied: We report our energy, GHG emissions, water, and waste intensity figures  

by GFA and GFA occupied. 

 

We adopt BCA’s definition for GFA. All covered floor areas of a building, except otherwise exempted, 

uncovered areas for commercial uses, are deemed the GFA of the building. Generally, car parks are 

excluded from GFA computation.

 

In our Commercial Properties, GFA computation includes common areas as well as tenant areas, due 

to the buildings’ central air conditioning systems.

 

For Hotels and Serviced Suites, GFA computation methodology was updated in 2020 to exclude tenant 

area as tenant area is small and not all properties have tenants. 2019 data for Hotels and Serviced 

Suites has been restated to exclude tenant area from GFA. GRI 102-48

 

GFA occupied is calculated by occupancy rate (simple average of monthly occupancy rates)  

multiplied by GFA.

7.  

Guest night: We adopt the definition from EarthCheck, a leading tourism benchmarking group. Guest 

night includes i) guests/staff staying overnight, ii) day/banquet guests and iii) non-resident restaurant 

guests, as illustrated in the equation below:

 

Guest night = Overnight guests/staff + (Day/banquet guests ÷ 3) + (Non-resident restaurant guests ÷ 4)

 i)  Guests/staff staying overnight: The number of guests staying overnight equals the number 

people staying over each night (including complimentary stays and staff that live on-site),  

added up over the year.

 

Example: Two people sharing a room for three nights is equal to 6 guest nights (2 x 3)

 ii) Day guests: Day guests represent the number of non-resident day guests (for example, the  

number of people turning up to use on-site facilities such as a spa, golf course, MICE or business 

centre, but do not stay overnight) added up over the year.

 

Day guests would also include delegates attending day conferences and/or functions.  

Please note that ‘Day guests’ does not include restaurant covers.

 

Example: Over the year, a hotel’s fitness centre received an additional 3,750 non-resident users.  

This would be equivalent to 1,250 guest nights (3,750 ÷ 3).

 iii) Non-resident restaurant guests: Non-resident restaurant guests represent the number of  

non-resident day guests (for example, the number of people turning up to dine at F&amp;B 

outlets/restaurants, but do not stay overnight) added up over the benchmarking period  

(typically 365 days).

 

Example: Over the year, a hotel’s restaurants/F&amp;B outlets received an additional 2,000 

non-resident restaurant users. This would be equivalent to 500 guest nights (2,000 ÷ 4).

8.  Building and development site details including property type, area and occupancy rates are  

available in UOL Annual Report 2020’s Property Summary, pages 74-81.

9.  GHG conversion is based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Emission factors for electricity generation 

are sourced from the Energy Market Authority (EMA), 2020. Greenhouse Gas Protocol Emission  

Factors from Cross Sector Tools, March 2017 were used for diesel conversions. 

10.  Source of conversion factor from diesel in litres to kWh is the Carbon Disclosure Project. Technical Note. 

Conversion of fuel data to MWh, 2016.

11.  Waste data for Mixed Developments, Offices and Retail properties include all users of the buildings.

12.  Waste data for Hotels and Serviced Suites includes guests, but excludes retail and F&amp;B  

tenants, except for PARKROYAL on Beach Road, where waste data includes disposal from  

PARKROYAL Serviced Suites Singapore and tenants at The Plaza, as these properties share the  

same disposal receptacle.

13.  Waste intensity formula excludes waste recycled. Waste intensity for hospitality is derived by total 

number of guest nights for simplicity.

Health and Safety

14.  Workplace health and safety data include development projects and hospitality.

 

Coverage for development projects: Workplace accidents involving main contractors and sub-contractors.

 

Coverage for hospitality: Workplace accidents involving all employees and contractors at hotels and 

serviced suites.

15.  Recordable work-related injury is defined as work-related injury or ill health that results in any of the 

following: death, days away from work, restricted work or transfer to another job, medical treatment 

beyond first aid, or loss of consciousness; or significant injury or ill health diagnosed by a physician  

or other licensed healthcare professional, even if it does not result in death, days away from work, 

restricted work or job transfer, medical treatment beyond first aid, or loss of consciousness.

 

Recordable work-related injury rate = (Number of recordable work-related injuries (excluding fatalities) 

/ Number of hours worked) x 1,000,000

 

High-consequence work-related injury is defined as a work-related injury that results in a fatality or  

in an injury from which the worker cannot, does not, or is not expected to recover fully to pre-injury 

health status within 6 months.

 

High-consequence work-related injury rate = (Number of high-consequence work-related injuries 

(excluding fatalities) / Number of hours worked) x 1,000,000

16.  Number of man-hours worked in safety data reported:

 

Development projects: The number of man-hours includes main contractors’ and sub-contractors’ hours.

 

Hospitality: The number of man-hours includes employees’ and contractors’ hours.

17.  Data collected for recordable work-related injuries follows the regulations by MOM that were in effect 

before September 2020 on reporting workplace accidents. Workplace accidents are reported if the 

accident results in hospitalisation for 24 hours or more or medical leave for three days, whether 

consecutive or not. Fatalities as a result of work must also be reported to MOM. Data collection 

for FY2021 onwards will be updated in line with the changes to MOM’s Work Injury Compensation  

Act that came into effect in September 2020. 

18. Lost days are calculated on the basis of calendar days at UOL and scheduled workdays at PPHG. 

 

Lost day rate = (Number of lost days) / (Number of hours worked) x 1,000,000

19. The new standard ISO 45001 will replace OHSAS 18001. Companies must migrate to the new standard 

by March 2021.

People

20.  While UOL Management Services (UMS) is a wholly-owned subsidiary, the working relationship is such 

that UMS is considered to be a contractor supplying facility management services to UOL. As such, 

figures reported for our property business exclude UMS as employees and instead report figures  

relating to UMS under contractors, where applicable.

21.  There are no significant variations in the total number of employees for both our property and  

hospitality businesses.

UOL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

47


References

22.  Scheduled workdays is calculated by 5 days x 52 weeks minus actual public holidays, actual  

annual leave and actual parental leave.

23.  A significant portion of the property development business is performed by our contractors during 

construction. Facilities management services are provided by UMS.

24.  Average training hours per employee = Total training hours for the year/Number of employees as at  

31 December.

25.  The definition of Senior Management is ‘Assistant General Manager and above’ for the property  

business, whereas for the hospitality business, it is ‘Vice President and above, Executive Committee 

Member and Head of Department’.

Community

26.  We track our community contributions internally and currently do not report on it externally, as this 

report is focused on our key material topics.

Compliance

27. Scope of number of significant fines or non-monetary sanctions includes:

 

•  Non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

 

•  Incidents of non-compliance concerning the health and safety impacts of products and services.

 

•  Substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy and losses of customer data.

 

•  Non-compliance with laws and regulations in the social and economic areas.

reference to the following components as listed under Rule 711B of the Singapore Exchange’s  

(SGX) Listing Manual;

– 

Material environmental, social and governance factors;

– 

Policies, practices and performance;

– 

Targets;

– 

Sustainability reporting framework; and

–

Basis for Conclusion

We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with Singapore Standard on  

Assurance Engagements 3000 Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical  

Financial Information (SSAE 3000). Our responsibilities are further described in the Auditors’  

Responsibilities section of our report. 

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Accounting and  

Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants 

and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, 

professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.

Our firm applies Singapore Standard on Quality Control 1 and, accordingly, maintains a comprehensive 

system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with  

ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

Responsibilities of Management

Management is responsible for: 

– 

preparing and presenting the Report in accordance with the GRI Standards and Rule 711B of  

the SGX Listing Manual, and the information and assertions contained within it; 

– 

determining UOL’s objectives in respect of sustainable development performance and reporting,  

including the identification of stakeholders and material issues; 

– 

establishing and maintaining appropriate internal control systems that enable the preparation and 

presentation of the Report and the selected GRI disclosures that are free from material misstatement, 

whether due to fraud or error; 

– 

preventing and detecting fraud and for identifying and ensuring that the Group complies with laws  

and regulations applicable to its activities; and

– 

ensuring that staff involved with the preparation and presentation of the Report are properly  

trained, information systems are properly updated and that any changes in reporting encompass  

all significant reporting units.

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s sustainability reporting process.

Auditors’ Responsibilities

Our responsibility is to carry out a limited assurance engagement in accordance with SSAE 3000 

and to express a conclusion based on the work performed. SSAE 3000 requires that we plan and 

perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Report is free from material 

misstatement. The extent of our work performed depends on our professional judgement and our 

assessment of the engagement risk. 

A limited assurance engagement consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for 

the preparation of information presented in the Report, and applying analytical and other evidence 

gathering procedures, as appropriate. These procedures included:

– 

inquiries of management to gain an understanding of UOL’s processes for determining the 

material issues for UOL’s key stakeholder groups;

– 

interviews with senior management and relevant staff at the corporate and selected business 

unit level concerning sustainability strategy and policies for material issues, and the implementation 

of these across the business; 

– 

interviews with relevant staff at the corporate and business unit level responsible for providing 

the information in the Report;

– 

inquiries of the design and implementation of the systems and methods used to collect and report 

on the GRI Disclosures, including the aggregation of the reported information;

– 

comparison of the GRI Disclosures presented in the Report to corresponding information in the 

relevant underlying sources to determine whether all the relevant information contained in such 

underlying sources has been appropriately included in the GRI Disclosures; and

– 

reading the information presented in the Report to determine whether it is in line with our overall 

knowledge of, and experience with, the sustainability performance of the Group.

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and 

are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance 

obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would 

have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.

Due to the inherent limitations of any internal control structure it is possible that errors or irregularities 

in the information presented in the Report may occur and not be detected. Our engagement is not 

designed to detect all weaknesses in the internal controls over the preparation and presentation of 

the Report, as the engagement has not been performed continuously throughout the period and 

the procedures performed were undertaken on a test basis.

Restriction on use

This report has been prepared for the Directors of UOL Group Limited for the purpose of providing an 

assurance conclusion on the Report and Selected GRI Disclosures and may not be suitable for 

another purpose. We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this report, to any 

person other than the Directors of UOL Group Limited, or for any other purpose than that for which 

it was prepared.
