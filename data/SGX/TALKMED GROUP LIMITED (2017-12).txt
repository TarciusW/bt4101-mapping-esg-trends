TALKMED GROUP LIMITED | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY17


TalkMed is proud to present its inaugural Sustainability 

Report for FY17. The report sets out our sustainability 

principles and initiatives that we have put in place to align 

our operations with our stakeholder’s expectations in the 

areas of environment, social responsibilities and governance.

ENVIRONMENT

We are committed to being environmentally conscious in all 

our practices. We ensure that our business is conducted in 

a safe and sustainable manner. For instance, we adopt best 

practices and adhere to relevant regulations to mitigate against 

the danger of improper handling and disposal of medical 

waste. We also hire licensed and experienced companies 

to collect, transport and dispose of any biohazardous and 

cytotoxic waste. 

Similarly, we aim to tackle other environmental risks associated 

with our day-to-day practices and ensure a safe environment 

for the community. We believe that sustainability reporting 

will help to instil discipline and raise awareness towards 

our long-term vision of sustainable practices throughout 

our organisation. It will allow us to see deeper into our risk 

factors, costs as well as our long-term corporate position and 

brand.

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES

TalkMed truly believes that people and community are 

key to the success of our business. We understand the 

importance of attracting and retaining the best management 

and healthcare talents to provide high quality service to our 

patients. Within our organisation, we enforce fair labour 

practices, create equal opportunities, and place great 

emphasis on occupational health and safety.

Our medical staff are encouraged to constantly update their 

technical knowledge and pursue opportunities to capitalise 

on the latest technological advancement in the field. We 

provide training opportunities to our doctors and medical 

staff to stay abreast of the latest medical trends and issues, 

treatment methods and medical equipment that is available 

in the market. Our doctors contribute articles in various 

newspapers, magazines and medical journals regularly. They 

also give talks to the public in Singapore and in the region to 

raise disease awareness and conduct educational sessions to 

medical professionals in neighbouring countries.

COMMUNITY

We are committed to creating a positive impact in the 

community we operate in by giving back to the society. Our 

local initiatives include, amongst others, partnering with a 

social enterprise named BloomBack to launch the Breast 

Cancer Awareness Month campaign(1), various donation 

drives such as “Yes We Can Hope”(1) and “Festive with a 

Heart”(1)  as well as being the bronze sponsor for the ”Relay 

for Life” event which was organised by Singapore Cancer 

Society(1).

GOVERNANCE

As a member of the medical fraternity, it is of utmost 

importance to uphold high standards of governance. As a 

public listed company, we strictly abide by the compliance 

rules in providing transparent, relevant and up-to-date 

information to our stakeholders and investors.

TalkMed continues to seek ways to enhance our healthcare 

services and constantly strive for medical excellence. We are 

committed to our focus on sustainability risks, and constantly 

evolve in our journey to provide the best and safest service 

to our customers, as well as create value for the community.

TALKMED GROUP LIMITED | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY17

SUSTAINABILITY BOARD STATEMENT 

GRI G4-1


TalkMed through its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) 

is a premier provider of medical oncology services, stem cell 

transplant services and palliative healthcare services. Based in 

Singapore, TalkMed’s operations extend to serve the markets 

in Vietnam and China via our joint venture partners.

 

Incorporated in September 2013, TalkMed is the holding 

company of the following wholly-owned subsidiaries: 

Singapore Cancer Centre Pte. Ltd., TalkMed Vietnam Pte. 

Ltd. (“TalkMed Vietnam”), and TalkMed China Pte. Ltd. 

(“TalkMed China”), as well as the following partially-owned 

subsidiaries: Stem Med Pte. Ltd. (“Stem Med”), TalkMed 

Chongqing Pte. Ltd., Stem Med Indonesia Pte. Ltd., and DrSG 

Cellular Wellness Pte. Ltd.. 

TalkMed also holds a 30% stake in Hong Kong Integrated 

Oncology Centre Holdings Limited (“HKH”). HKH is the 

controlling shareholder of Hong Kong Integrated Oncology 

Centre Limited (“HKIOC”) which operates an oncology centre 

in Hong Kong that offers integrated cancer care across various 

disciplines. Following the collaboration with Hong Kong 

Adventist Hospital, HKIOC now provides a comprehensive 

range of treatment (including surgery, radiotherapy and 

medication), diagnostic imaging and endoscopy services in 

Hong Kong.

The Company’s highly-trained doctors provide tertiary 

healthcare services to the oncology patients in the private 

sector in Singapore, through Parkway Cancer Centre (“PCC”). 

Our clinical functions involve attending to patients, examining 

and administering medical treatments and performing minor 

outpatient surgical procedures, prescribing medicines and 

conducting laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures. We 

also review the results of these investigations and follow-up 

patient care.

We have fourteen doctors at eight clinics in Gleneagles 

Hospital Singapore, Mount Elizabeth Hospital Singapore, 

Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre and Mount Elizabeth Novena 

Specialist Centre Singapore, which are operated by Parkway 

Hospitals Singapore Pte. Ltd.. The majority of our patient-

load and customers consists of foreigners, thus establishing 

our position in the medical tourism market. 

TalkMed Vietnam was set up in March 2014 and pursuant 

to its incorporation, partnered with Thu Cuc International 

General Hospital to set up a medical centre known as 

Singapore Cancer Centre Thu Cuc that provides specialist 

medical oncology services in Hanoi, Vietnam. 

Stem Med, set up in January 2015, is the first private stem cell 

banking facility in Singapore that specialises in the processing, 

cryopreservation and storage of adult stem cells. In March 

2017, Stem Med incorporated Stem Med Indonesia Pte. Ltd., 

a 90%-owned subsidiary, to explore business opportunities in 

Indonesia in the areas of operation of cellular laboratories and 

storage facilities and cellular therapeutics clinics. In October 

2017, Stem Med incorporated DrSG Cellular Wellness Pte. 

Ltd., a 60%-owned subsidiary, with A DrBrand Pte. Ltd. 

(“ADB”) taking the remaining 40%. Capitalising on the 

expertise of both Stem Med and ADB in the fields of stem 

cell technology and aesthetics respectively, this subsidiary 

plans to research and produce highly-effective products and 

technologically-advanced treatments for hair rejuvenation 

and customised skin care for the global beauty market.

In September 2017, the Group incorporated a wholly-owned 

subsidiary, TalkMed China to explore healthcare-related 

collaborations in China. Subsequent to the incorporation 

of TalkMed China, TalkMed China incorporated TalkMed 

Chongqing Pte. Ltd., a 75%-owned subsidiary, with the aim 

of providing healthcare management services in Chongqing.

In November 2017, TalkMed China entered into a 

collaboration with Beijing New Hope Hospital Management 

Co. Ltd. for TalkMed China to offer oncology management 

services in China.

We strongly believe in embedding sustainability across all

mission.

VISION: Our vision is to be a premier provider of medical 

oncology and palliative care health care services in the private 

sector in Singapore and in the region.

MISSION: Our mission is to deliver quality care and service to 

our patients. Looking ahead, providing medical oncology and 

palliative care health care services in the region and expanding 

our services to include the provision of secondary and primary 

healthcare are also an integral part of our business model.

TalkMed supports the precautionary principles by taking 

actions to reduce our environmental impacts.

GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

We conduct our business by inculcating a clean and 

transparent working culture within the organisation. We 

have clear policies on business standards, ethics and anti-

corruption. We understand the detrimental effect that 

corruption has on organisations and the society. We are 

determined to ensure that our business decisions and actions 

are ethical and in full compliance with international and local 

legal requirements.

We do not condone any malpractice, impropriety, non-

compliance of statutory law and rules and regulations or 

wrongdoing by employees in the course of performing 

their duties. Employees may follow the procedures set out 

in the Company’s whistleblowing policy that is accessible 

on our human resource website to report any concern or 

complaint regarding any improper accounting or financial 

matters, internal controls, disclosure of information, conflict 

of interest, insider trading, or any other areas involving fraud, 

corruption and misconduct of employees.

Our sustainability efforts are led by our senior management 

who ensures that the Company’s business objectives are in line 

with our commitments to sustainable development. Senior 

management is responsible for the on-going communication 

with the Board of Directors.

CUSTOMER HEALTH AND SAFETY

GRI G4-DMA | G4-PR2

Why is this a material issue?

Our goal at TalkMed, is to constantly exceed customers’ 

expectations and provide services of the highest quality. 

The safety and wellbeing of our patients is always our top 

priority. We have integrated quality standards and procedures 

as well as continuous monitoring systems to ensure a safe

FY17 PERFORMANCE AND TARGETS

FY17 PERFORMANCE

                     FY18 TARGET

Compliant with significant regulations concerning the 

health and safety impacts of our products and services

TalkMed aims to continue its performance by maintaining 

a strong framework to ensure compliance with relevant 

guidelines and regulations

Our approach to managing

In the course of our work, we adhere strictly to government 

regulations such as Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics 

Act, Medicine Act, Health Products Act, Singapore Medical 

Council Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines. 

This is made possible by having a set of clinical standard 

operating procedures (“SOP”) and maintaining high levels of 

competency for our clinical staff. We have nurses’ competency 

checklists to assess the competency levels of our nurses. As 

we handle blood products, we have also put in place an 

apheresis competency checklist. The SOP and checklists are 

reviewed every year for relevance and completeness.

PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY




EMPLOYMENT

GRI G4-DMA | G4-LA1 

Why is this a material issue?

Our doctors and specialists are the backbone of the Group. 

In order to consistently provide excellent customer service, 

we are committed to maintaining a talented and diverse 

workforce.

As our employees are our most valuable assets, attracting and 

retaining top talents is of great significance to TalkMed. We 

aspire to create an environment that helps our staff perform 

to the highest of their abilities and deliver quality care and 

services to our patients. 

Our approach to managing

To ensure that we meet the above targets, we adhere to strict 

talent acquisition standards. We have delegated recruitment 

responsibility of doctors to Chief Executive Officer/Chief 

Operating Officer, clinical staff to nurse management and 

human resource department respectively to ensure competent 

and qualified individuals are hired for the right position.

We strive to create a conducive work environment through fair 

and competitive human resources policies, and an equitable 

system of recognition and rewards. We provide our doctors 

an opportunity to participate in a revenue-sharing scheme 

as well as provide attractive year-end bonuses for the staff.  

In addition to above, we provide yearly subsidised holidays 

to promote staff bonding.  We also recognise long-serving 

staff for their dedication by rewarding them with long service 

awards.
