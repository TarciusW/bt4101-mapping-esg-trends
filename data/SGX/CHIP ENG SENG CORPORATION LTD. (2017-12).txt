SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

For measuring and reporting Chip Eng Seng’s 

carbon footprint, we have applied the Greenhouse 

Gas (GHG) Protocol Corporate Accounting and 

Reporting Standard.

We have also identified the UN Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs) which align with our 

material ESG topics and where we see the potential 

to contribute.

REPORTING PROCESS

Chip Eng Seng’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) 

provides direction to the management in developing 

sustainability reporting. The Board has the 

responsibility to determine the material ESG factors 

and disclosures for sustainability reporting.

of the Committee include senior management 

executives from key functions and business units. 

Under guidance from the Board, the Committee 

oversees the development of sustainability report 

content and prioritisation of sustainability topics.

A sustainability reporting project team is responsible 

for collecting and verifying ESG performance data in 

preparation of the sustainability report.

Chip Eng Seng is committed to publishing its 

sustainability report on an annual basis.

REPORT CONTENT AND QUALITY

The content of the report has been determined on the 

basis of materiality assessment, analysis of stakeholder 

expectations and potential ESG risks and opportunities 

arising from our business activities. 

We have applied the principles of accuracy, balance, 

clarity, comparability, reliability and timeliness to help 

stakeholders assess our sustainability performance.

ESG data provided in the report have mainly been 

extracted from internal information systems and

CHIP ENG SENG CORPORATION LTD

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

WE ARE COMMITTED TO SUSTAINABLE 

BUSINESS GROWTH

Our approach is to focus on the most significant 

environmental, social and economic impacts, risks 

and opportunities arising from our business operations 

and on the issues that are most important to 

our stakeholders.

The construction and property development sector 

has significant positive and negative impacts on the 

economy, environment and communities. The United 

Nations Environment Programme’s Sustainable 

Buildings and Climate Initiative estimates that 

buildings account for 40% of global energy use, 

25% of global water consumption, 40% of global 

resources consumption and nearly one-third of global 

GHG emissions. At the same time, the sector plays a 

crucial role in the social and economic development 

by creating jobs, catalysing commercial activities, 

providing housing, and building industrial and business 

infrastructure for growth.

CES is engaged in construction, property development, 

hospitality and property investment business. The 

Group’s property development segment accounted for 

66% of our total revenue in 2017. 

Constructing the Housing Development Board’s 

(HDB) affordable public housing in Singapore 

constitutes the bulk of our construction business. 

Our approach is to adhere to the standards set by 

HDB as well as the Building and Construction Authority 

(BCA) which include environmental, safety and 

community parameters.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

Sustainability Approach

We work closely with BCA to adopt and implement 

green design and construction technologies so as to 

minimise emissions and promote sustainable living 

environments. We also work closely with the HDB to 

develop sustainable HDB homes.

Overall, our approach is to integrate sustainability at 

all stages of our projects.

SUPPORTING SUSTAINABLE 

DEVELOPMENT GOALS

We have examined the 17 UN SDGs and believe our 

business has the potential to support many of these 

goals. As a start, we have aligned our material ESG 

factors with the relevant SDGs. Our next step would be 

to explore ways to integrate the SDGs into our business 

operations to support sustainable business growth.

MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE

We are committed to being part of national and 

international efforts to mitigate the risks of climate 

change. In line with the Paris Agreement on climate 

change, we are supportive of Singapore’s commitment 

to reduce the nation’s emissions intensity by 36% 

from 2005 levels by 2030 and stabilise the country’s 

greenhouse gas emissions with the aim of peaking 

around 2030.

BOARD STATEMENT

Chip Eng Seng has built its business through a 

dedication to quality, the environment, health and 

safety, ethics and integrity. The Group is committed 

to safeguarding the environment, people and 

communities while undertaking its business activities.

The Board considers sustainability issues as part of 

its strategy formulation. The Board endorses the 

material ESG factors presented in this report. The 

Board has also provided oversight of the management 

and monitoring of these material ESG factors, through 

regular review of performance indicators.

MATERIAL FACTORS

We carried out a comprehensive materiality 

assessment to determine the most important issues 

to be covered in this report. Senior management 

representatives from all business units and functions 

attended a workshop conducted by an external 

sustainability expert to review and assess stakeholder 

concerns and the critical sustainability issues relating 

to our business activities. The participants identified 

the environmental, social and economic impacts, risks 

and opportunities in our value chain.

We considered national and international sustainability 

trends in the real estate sector, the GRI Standards, 

GRI’s G4 Construction and Real Estate Sector 

Disclosures, the SGX Sustainability Reporting Guide, 

and stakeholder expectations when prioritising the 

material issues for reporting.

CHIP ENG SENG CORPORATION LTD

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

Environment

We are committed to mitigating our 

environmental impact by adopting sustainable 

building designs, materials and technologies.  



GREEN AND GRACIOUS

Green building and sustainable living are important 

to our customers, tenants, employees, communities 

and the regulators. Our Green and Gracious policy 

promotes activities and initiatives to prevent and 

minimise adverse environmental impacts associated 

with our building construction work. 

Environmental standards and management is a critical 

part of our Environment, Health and Safety (QEHS) 

system and we are committed to ensuring effective 

environmental management.  We have obtained ISO 

14000 for our environmental management system that 

reflects our dedication to continuous improvement. 

We depute Environmental Control Officers to ensure 

compliance with environmental and public health 

regulations applicable to the site work.

Our policy is to assess and manage the environmental 

impacts, risks and opportunities of our business 

activities to support sustainable building and 

construction practices. We embed energy efficiency 

and resource conservation at all stages of our value 

chain by incorporating sustainable features. Our 

policies and practices are directed at mitigating our 

environmental impacts.

We focus on energy use, GHG emission reduction, 

materials selection, waste management, water 

conservation, wastewater recycling, and noise and 

dust containment to minimise our impact on the 

environment.

Bukit Batok N4C15


16

CHIP ENG SENG CORPORATION LTD

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

We measure and monitor our material environmental 

factors to ensure continuous improvement. We have 

implemented a process for collecting data for energy, 

water and waste on a weekly basis. We have also 

developed goals and targets for these environmental 

metrics and monitor them regularly.

We seek regular feedback on environmental issues 

from our employees, building authorities, and relevant 

stakeholders, in addition to conducting a regular and 

routine review of our policies, projects and initiatives.

CLIMATE CHANGE

Globally, buildings account for significant energy 

use and GHG emissions. Buildings are also at risk 

from extreme weather conditions caused by climate 

change. At Chip Eng Seng, we support the global 

goal of limiting the temperature rise well below 2˚ 

Celsius. Green design, energy efficiency and resource 

conservation are an integral part of our management 

approach. Managing our carbon emissions is an 

essential element of our environmental programme.

ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE

Our environmental performance data is presented 

in the sections that follow. The amount of energy 

and water used, as well as the amount of waste and 

wastewater generated, depends on the construction 

phase of a project. Usually, power and water 

consumption are higher during the middle stages of 

a project.

ENERGY

Construction activity consumes a significant amount 

of energy, including grid electricity and diesel for 

running power generators. Our energy initiatives focus 

on minimising consumption of electricity and diesel at 

construction sites. Lower energy consumption is not 

only helpful in reducing our carbon footprint, but it 

also saves costs.

Our total electricity consumption at construction sites 

was 1,155,279 kWh in 2017 as against 751,481 kWh in the 

prior year. Diesel consumption was 1,353,843 litres in 

2017 compared with 1,325,100 litres in the preceding 

year. In 2017, energy intensity was 0.271 GJ/m2 of 

Gross Floor Area built against 0.259 GJ/m2 in the 

previous year.

We monitor electricity consumption in our head office 

building, including the common area but excluding 

the tenants’ use. We also measure and report the 

associated carbon emissions.

 

ENERGY

 

EFFICIENCY

We have implemented several measures 

at construction sites to minimise energy 

consumption. Initiatives include the use of 

energy-efficient equipment where possible. 

Examples include:

• Energy-efficient LED Lights.

• Installing 2-tick energy-saving air-conditioning 

units at site office.

• Power-efficient printers.

• Promoting energy-saving campaigns by placing 

posters and signs to remind staff to switch off 

any electrical equipment when not in use and to 

maintain air-con temperatures at 25oC.

• Use of window blinds to minimise the heat from 

outside.

CHIP ENG SENG CORPORATION LTD

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

GHG EMISSIONS

We measure and monitor GHG emissions from our 

energy use and regularly review our performance. Our 

total carbon dioxide (CO2) emission in 2017 was 4,084 

tonnes compared with 3,837 tonnes in 2016. Emissions 

intensity for the same period was 19.0 kgCO2/m2 and 

18.4 kgCO2/m2 respectively.

BUILDING MATERIALS 

We closely monitor our use of materials to minimise 

waste and select materials which have a lower impact 

on the environment. We use pre-cast concrete walls 

which are more efficient and reduce pollution at the 

construction site.

In construction, we use a wide variety of sustainable 

materials with the Singapore Green Label that meets 

the Green Mark criteria.

Our materials use in the stated period is summarised 

below: 

WASTE

Our waste is mainly generated from construction 

activities on-site and are non-hazardous. Our approach 

is to reduce, reuse and recycle waste where practical. 

We dispose of waste through licensed contractors in 

accordance with the applicable regulations. Waste 

generated at our construction sites in 2017 was 5,830 

tonnes as against 4,448 tonnes in the preceding year.

WATER

Water is a precious resource in Singapore, and we 

make efforts to conserve it. Our policy is to use water 

responsibly and implement conservation initiatives. 

Our measures include collecting rainwater to reduce 

the demand for fresh water, as well as reusing and 

recycling water. We install a silty water treatment 

system at sites to prevent water contamination. We 

use pre-cast concrete which has significantly reduced 

the need for the on-site use of water.  We use water-

efficient taps and fittings that have a 3-tick rating by 

the Public Utilities Board to conserve water. We install 

dual flush closets to save water.

We track our water use, including the usage in 

our head office and CES Centre, and review our 

consumption regularly. In 2017, our water consumption 

at construction sites was 173,964 m3 as against 

141,541 m3 in 2016. Water intensity for the same period 

was 0.83 m3/m2 and 0.68 m3/m2  respectively.

WASTEWATER

All wastewater generated at our construction sites 

is collected, treated and disposed of according to 

environmental regulations. We implement measures to 

prevent and control contamination from oil, chemical 

drums and bulk storage tanks.

We implement the required earth control measures to 

manage silty discharge due to rainwater.

We also monitor our wastewater to find ways to 

minimise it.

We use wastewater as well as rainwater to wash 

vehicles before they leave the construction site so as 

to keep the roads clean.

POLLUTION 

Construction activity, vehicles, heavy equipment 

and machinery at the construction sites generates 

noise, dust and vibrations which can be a source of 

nuisance for workers as well as the neighbouring 

community. Our policy is to minimise the noise, dust 

and vibrations pollution by strictly implementing 

regulatory guidelines and industrial best practices, and 

constantly monitoring our construction work to keep 

the noise under permissive levels. We ensure regular 

maintenance of the equipment and machinery to 

reduce noise. Our use of pre-cast concrete panels also 

helps in minimising noise at the construction site. 

We closely supervise piling and demolition work to 

ensure that vibrations caused from such activities do 

not exceed permitted limits.

Construction sites generate dust from concrete, 

cement, wood, stone, and silica. We take preventive 

measures to control the spread of dust. We use screens 

to stop dust from spreading and place fine mesh 

screening close to the dust source. We also use water 

sprays to control dust pollution.

More importantly, we engage with the affected 

community to keep them informed of our impending 

construction schedules. We promptly address and 

resolve any pollution related complaints.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Complying with applicable environmental regulations 

is a top priority for the Group as non-compliance may 

result in penalties and loss of reputation. We carefully 

examine applicable rules, including environmental 

and public health laws, to put in place the necessary 

policies and practices to ensure compliance.

In 2017, there were no incidents of stop work 

orders or demerit points relating to or arising from 

environmental regulations. Regrettably, there were 

four incidents of composition fines for vectors-related 

lapses. We have since taken corrective measures to 

prevent the recurrence of the problem.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

People

We are committed to building a workplace where our people 

can realise their full professional and personal potential. 

We consider employees as our most important resource. 

Our human resource policies promote fair employment and 

overall well-being of our people. Ensuring safety at the 

workplace is our foremost priority.



EMPLOYMENT

We employed 361 full-time employees for construction 

and property development, all of whom were on 

permanent job contracts, as at the end of 2017. There 

were only two part-time employees. We hired 53 new 

employees during the year.

In addition, we employed 399 foreign construction 

workers. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) regulates 

the hiring of foreign construction workers in Singapore.

We have a relatively younger workforce. The average 

age of our employees is 36.8 years.

DIVERSITY

We are proud of our diverse workforce comprising 

different backgrounds. The CES Group is an equal 

opportunity employer. Maintaining workplace diversity 

in terms of gender, age, experience and culture is 

important to us. As such, our workplace policies 

encourage hiring, rewarding and promoting based 

on merit.

As at the end of 2017, women represented 32% of our 

full-time employees. Women held 31% of supervisory 

and managerial positions. The proportion of women in 

the new hires was 42%.

CHIP ENG SENG CORPORATION LTD

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

We have an ethnically diverse workforce represented 

by members of different races. Our people also come 

from different age groups.

TRAINING

We believe that ongoing training is crucial for 

retaining and developing talent. We provide regular 

training opportunities for our people to enhance their 

professional development. 

In 2017, we organised training on more than 70 topics, 

including: workplace safety, health and environmental 

management, sustainability reporting, quality and 

productivity, lean construction, best practices for 

green and gracious builders, earth control measures, 

construction regulations, service excellence, virtual 

design and construction, contract management, and 

managerial skills development.

UPGRADING WORKFORCE SKILLS

We have implemented a programme to help Basic-

Skilled foreign construction workers upgrade to the 

Higher-Skilled R1 category in accordance with the 

criteria set out by the MOM. Investing in upgrading 

skills means higher productivity and a lower levy that 

we need to pay. Also, Higher-Skilled workers can be 

employed for an extended period of up to 22 years 

instead of just 10 years for Basic-Skilled workers.

In 2017, 131 workers were successfully upgraded to the 

Higher-Skilled category. These workers had received a 

combined 4,540 hours of training in a variety of trades. 

Some of the training topics included: reinforced 

concrete works, electrical works, gas pipefitting 

works, plumbing and piping works, construction plant 

operation (non-lifting), supervisor (structural) and 

supervisor (architectural).

PROMOTING WORKPLACE SAFETY

Workplace safety is crucial to our success in the 

construction business. In Singapore, the construction 

sector continues to be the top contributor of accidents, 

accounting for 36% of all workplace fatalities, 

according to the WSH National Statistics Report 2017. 

We are committed to providing a safe and healthy 

workplace for our workers and contractors. Safety and 

health are at the core of our QESH system and our 

target is to have zero workplace accidents. 

We are focused on building a culture of safety across 

the Group.

For each project, we conduct a thorough risk 

assessment to identify and mitigate safety hazards. 

We ensure compliance with safety regulations and 

align our work processes with industry standards for 

safe construction.

Our employees receive frequent safety briefings and 

trainings to understand safety risks inherent in various 

construction activities and to learn safe work practices.

DRIVING SAFETY THROUGH INNOVATION

We continuously explore new methods to lower the 

risk of injury in structural installations. For instance, 

our subsidiary Chip Eng Seng Contractors (1988) Pte 

Ltd developed the Z-Bracket, which is a lightweight 

steel hollow section with a pipe socket at one end. This 

enables the leg of a scaffolding frame to be seamlessly 

slotted into it. The principal advantage of this simple 

yet useful product is that it allows the scaffolding 

structure to be directly clamped onto the parapet wall, 

providing added stability and eliminating the need to 

set up extensive scaffolding at a building’s exterior.

We track and regularly review the safety performance 

at our construction sites against critical indicators. 

A summary of our safety record is presented below.

dinner, management recreation, festival gatherings, 

bereavement donations and wreaths, newborn baby 

gifts and long service award.

CARING FOR FOREIGN CONSTRUCTION WORKERS

We employed 399 foreign construction workers as at 

the end of 2017. We hire foreign construction workers 

from source countries approved by the MOM. MOM 

regulates the hiring of foreign construction workers 

in Singapore and requires all foreign construction 

workers to attend the Construction Safety Orientation 

Course or the Apply Workplace Safety and Health in 

Construction Sites training.

We provide housing facility to our foreign workers in 

approved dormitories fitted with modern amenities. 

The facilities and services at the dormitories include 

dedicated cooking areas, laundry and recreational 

facilities such as gym and outdoor games courts.

Our construction workers receive welfare benefits 

which include free Wifi at quarters on construction 

sites, televisions at the canteen and washing machines.

WORKER WELFARE

The welfare of our workers is an important aspect 

of our human resources management. We provide 

transport facilities to workers to travel between their 

dormitory and the construction site. The worker 

dormitories are equipped with entertainment facilities 

such as television, wireless internet and common 

areas for leisure activities. We have also provided 

bicycle parking areas for workers as many of them use 

bicycles to travel.

We organise a number of recreational activities for the 

workers which include sports competitions, birthday 

celebrations, fruit day and barbeque parties during 

festive periods. 

Workers who perform exceptionally well during the 

month also receive monetary rewards and a certificate 

of appreciation.

QUALITY AND SAFETY STANDARDS

We insist on exacting safety standards as well as 

excellent design and workmanship to ensure the 

safety and well-being of the occupants in the housing 

we build.

Our approach to safe design and construction 

focuses on structural stability, high quality materials 

and dedicated workmanship. We employ qualified 

and experienced teams of architects, engineers and 

technical staff to ensure that each project meets our 

stringent norms of quality and safety.

We build our projects in strict compliance with building 

regulations and standards. We participate in the 

Construction Quality Assessment System (CONQUAS), 

introduced by BCA to benchmark our workmanship on 

a national basis.  The average CONQUAS scores of our 

two projects completed in 2017 was 90.8 as against the 

national average of 88.9. The average score of the two 

projects completed in 2016 was 92.4, higher than the 

national average of 88.7.

SUB-CONTRACTORS

Our Quality, Environmental, Health and Safety (QEHS) 

policies also cover our sub-contractors to ensure safety 

and compliance at our construction sites. Preference 

is given to the suppliers and subcontractors who have 

obtained bizSAFE level 3 certification for workplace 

safety and health. 

We ensure ongoing engagement with subcontractors 

through regular meetings, reviews, training and 

briefing sessions to help them achieve the required 

quality and EHS standards. 

Subcontractors’ EHS performance is reviewed every 

six months. We have also instituted annual awards to 

recognise subcontractors for their EHS performance.

SHARING BEST PRACTICES

We welcome opportunities to share our QEHS best 

practices with peers. In 2016, we worked with the 

Workplace Safety and Health Council (WSHC) to host 

a visit to one of Chip Eng Seng’s HDB project sites, to 

showcase and share with forum participants the safety 

controls we adopt for high-risk work activities. We also 

conducted a site visit for 60 participants from six HDB 

worksites in Tampines, to share and learn from each 

other’s best practices in QEHS standards.

COMPLIANCE

We are committed to running our business responsibly 

and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 

We regularly review and monitor our policies and 

practices with regard to regulatory requirements. We 

disseminate regulatory updates to the relevant staff to 

help them stay up to date with legal requirements.

We have put in place systems to ensure compliance 

with all the relevant laws and regulations, including but 

not limited to the requirements issued by MOM 

and BCA.

There were no significant fines in the stated period for 

non-compliance with laws in the social and economic 

area.

We contribute to a number of social causes, including 

the arts, education and healthcare. We work closely 

with Singapore’s construction community and non-

profit organisations to provide support for various 

philanthropic projects through giving and fund-raising 

efforts. We also encourage our employees to volunteer 

in community initiatives.

In 2017, our donations for various community 

programmes amounted to $278,373. We have donated 

$1.75 million in the last three years to a broad range of 

social organisations. 

The main beneficiaries of our giving programme in 

2017 included Ren Ci Hospital, Singapore 

Thong Chai Medical Institution, Yellow Ribbon Fund, 

PAP Community Foundation, and Singapore 

Chinese Orchestra.

Our Group companies and employees also participated 

in several community programmes throughout the 

year.

Park Hotel Alexandra (PHAL) partnered with Rainbow 

Centre Singapore, a non-profit organisation for 

children with special needs, to organise a work 

experience programme for youths above the age of 17 

years. Under the initiative, 18 children were invited to 

the hotel to learn tasks related to housekeeping, food 

and beverage, culinary, and bell services. 

At the start of the year, employee volunteers from 

CES and PHAL visited Rainbow Centre, assisting 

in decorating the school for the Chinese New Year 

celebrations and distributing mandarin oranges to 

mark the festivities.

CES and PHAL employee volunteers also helped to 

raise awareness for autism by supporting the Autism 

in the Community,, a joint initiative by five voluntary 

welfare organisations that include Autism Resource 

Centre, Autism Association of Singapore, St Andrew’s 

Autism Centre, Asian Women Welfare Association and 

Rainbow Centre. In support of the programme, Park 

Hotel’s façade light and Aqua Luna bar’s lighting was 

turned to blue, the colour representing autism. Non-

uniformed staff also wore at least one blue accessory 

for the month of April to build awareness about autism.

Eight volunteers from PHAL assisted in Rainbow 

Centre’s 30th Anniversary celebrations by packing 

goodie bags to be distributed to the event’s guests.

Along with the students, their parents and teachers 

from Rainbow Centre, six PHAL volunteers took part 

in the Standard Chartered Ekiden Marathon, where 

each team of six runners brought their training and 

teamwork together to complete a 42.192km run. PHAL 

and the Centre’s participants participated in weekly 

training sessions over a period of three months to 

prepare for the marathon.
