Sustainability Report 2018 

 

Overview of Report 

 

Regal International Group Ltd. (“RIG” or the “Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, the 

“Group”) is pleased to present its second Sustainability Report covering its sustainability 

performance in the financial year ended 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”). No restatements were 

made from the previous report as there were no significant changes to the organization and 

our supply chain during the reporting cycle. Our approach to sustainability is guided by the 

Company’s mission to create sustainable values for our stakeholders.  

 

This Sustainability Report (the “SR”) attempts to inform our stakeholders of our sustainability 

efforts and performance using a structured approach guided by the Global Reporting 

Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards (“GRI Standards”), by reporting the key material 

aspects of sustainability as well as the Company’s strategies, initiatives and performance in 

relation to environmental, social and governance issues. 

 

Scope of Report 

 

RIG started publishing its Sustainability Report on an annual basis starting from June 2018, for 

the financial year ended 31 December 2017 (“FY2017”). This report covers FY2018 from 1 

January 2018 to 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”).  

 

This report aims to provide a balanced and reasonable representation of the sustainability 

performance of RIG. All the information and statistics are in relations to the Group’s operations 

unless stated otherwise. All information and data are not verified by third party. Internal data 

monitoring and verification has been relied on to ensure accuracy. 

 

Reporting Process 

 

RIG engaged an external consultant to facilitate the sustainability reporting process and to 

advise on the industry leading practices on sustainability reporting in FY2017. For FY2018, the 

Board of Directors (the “Board”) and RIG’s management would rely on internal efforts to 

present the respective statistics of the key material aspects of sustainability. 

 

RIG’s Sustainability Reporting Committee (the “SR Committee”) consists of the Chief Executive 

Officer (the “CEO”), the SR Champion, and the key management staff of each core business 

function.  

 

The SR Committee is responsible for the preparation of SR. After key management staff from 

the various departments collated data statistics and information necessary, the SR Champion 

will compile and coordinate the SR report for further review and comments by the SR 

Committee and the Board.

Message from the Board 

 

Despite challenging market conditions and adversities brought by changes in the political 

landscape, the Group followed through on its efforts to conserve business sustainability in 

FY2018. 

 

Sustainable Success 

 

Regardless of economic performance, RIG has been insistent about operating in a safe and 

environment friendly manner. The Company’s management believes that sustainable success 

is only possible with collaborative efforts between the company, its stakeholders, the 

environment and its operating communities. 

 

Achievements 

 

Graduating from a small building construction and property development company since 

2004, the Group has achieved an impressive track record of constructing and developing 

more than 20 property development projects in Kuching and Kota Samarahan area, including 

shop houses, landed residential properties, condominiums, commercial and industrial units. 

 

RIG’s Group CEO, Mr. Su Chung Jye was conferred the Brand Leader Award (Property 

Development) at the Asia Enterprise Brand Awards (AEBA) 2018/19 ceremony in November 

2018. This is a recognition of the significant market and brand presence the Group had 

established in Sarawak, East Malaysia. 

 

Forward Strategy 

 

Pursuing its vision to be the international gateway for investors into East Malaysia, RIG has 

ventured into diversified territories in search of new strategic opportunities and growth since 

2016. 

 

In alignment with its long-term expansion plan, the Group has been active in exploring 

opportunities to foster innovations and build capabilities for new business growth. RIG believes 

that these strategies will enable the Group to attain business success as a value-added builder 

developer that integrates real estate products with complementary business ventures of 

sustainable growth. 

 

Corporate Social Initiatives 

 

Giving and sharing has been an integrated part of RIG’s corporate culture. Staff and 

management of the Group has been ardently participating in fundraisers for welfare 

organizations, schools, associations for the underprivileged, orphanage and old folk homes in 

Kuching, Sarawak on a regular basis.

sustainability. Our shareholders, investors, customers, employees, suppliers, contractors and 

communities where we operate in, are all factors contributing to sustainable business growth.  

 

We offered our most heartfelt thanks to each and every one of our stakeholders for their faith 

and support. We are grateful to our stakeholders for the opportunities to serve, communicate, 

work together, as well as to improve and excel.  

 

With our stakeholders’ blessings and support, the Group is committed to strive even harder in 

order to achieve its goal of a successful builder developer that integrates real estate products

Strategic Update 

 

Fundamental Beliefs  

 

Giving and sharing has been an integral part of RIG’s corporate culture since day one. Started 

more than 14 years ago, the Group has been playing an active role in charitable community 

works with the aim of creating a more harmonious society. 

 

Staff and management of RIG has been passionately participating in fundraisers for welfare 

organizations, schools, associations for the underprivileged, orphanage and old folk homes in 

Kuching, Sarawak on a regular basis. Our vision of “Creating a Sustainable Future” denotes our 

business value when developing properties, as we aspire to build a future where all needs and 

wants of all stakeholders could be accommodated. 

 

Commitment  

 

The Group believes in giving back to the society and contributing to the general social well-

being through the execution of development projects and the management of its operations. 

In addition to the yearly Chinese New Year red packets (Angpows) giveaway at various 

welfare associations, RIG has been supportive of activities organized by Sarawak Children’s 

Cancer Society (SCCS), Sarawak Cheshire Home, Salvation Army and Kuching Autistic 

Association. 

 

In February 2018, RIG spread joy of the Chinese New Year by handing out Angpows to over 

550 members of the various welfare organisations in Kuching, Sarawak. These tokens of 

blessings put smile and warmth in these less fortunate, who are mostly ailing elderly and 

forsaken children in old folk homes and orphanage. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In the month of June 2018, RIG hosted the annual Sarawak Children’s Cancer Society (SCCS) 

Movie Day at CityOne Megamall Cineplex with 107 children and their families. The Company 

hopes to alleviate some of the sufferings that these children face in their daily battles against 

cancer through the initiative.

sales proceeds were donated to the aforementioned charities.

property market, the Group’s CEO, Mr. Su Chung Jye and Executive Director, Mr. Wong Pak

Commitment (cont’d) 

 

The Group strives to maintain a balanced relationship with the Government, trade 

organisations, business partners and its customers to achieve mutual success in creating a

In line with our aspiration to create sustainability in property development, RIG is committed to 

manage its consultants, main contractors and subcontractors, as well as various suppliers of 

services, materials and equipment effectively in order to sustain a complex and viable supply 

chain network. Efficient management of complications and challenges are necessary to 

deliver large and mid-scale projects successfully.

financial stability, as well as adherence to established safety and environmental standards.  

 

Aspirations For Coming Year

cost and increase profitability. Fortifying the Group’s core business foundations, enhancing its 

internal processes and resources, in addition to embarking new development projects in 

alignment with market demands are deemed to be the core directives in the coming year.

Environmental and Social Impacts 

 

RIG’s diverse property portfolio includes a mixture of shop 

houses, 

landed 

residential 

properties, 

condominiums, 

commercial and industrial units, offering an array of shopping, 

dining, business and entertainment options. 

 

Stepping into 2019, the Group has already launched two new 

affordable housing projects in 2019 - Jambusan Heights and 

Richmond Park, respectively situated near the rural town of 

Bau and mid-way between Kuching and Serian town (see map 

on right). 

 

 

Building on over 20 acres of land 5-minute 

away from Bau town, Jambusan Heights will 

comprise of 206 units of single and double-

storey terrace houses each reasonably 

priced below RM400,000.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Along the Jalan Kuching-Serian highway, RIG will build 96 units of affordable single and double-

storey terrace houses under the Richmond Park project, to help ease the intense market 

demand for affordable housing. These affordable residential units are between 550 to 880 

square feet, priced reasonably and appropriately for the lower to middle income group.

Environmental and Social Impacts (cont’d) 

 

These two property projects are not expected to simply fulfil the more needs for affordable 

housing, new infrastructure improvements such as new paved roads, substations for electricity, 

water and sewer pipes, internet cabling, as well as new commercial opportunities for those 

living in the community will also be created subsequently. 

 

The Jambusan Heights and Richmond Park projects are planned to develop the surrounding 

area outside of Kuching town. Diffused living is an essential phase of a growing population and 

economy. RIG is proud to contribute its part towards the growth of a more vibrant community, 

creating quality living environment via sustainable methodologies.

Identifying Material Aspects  

 

Materiality Assessment 

 

Following the engagement of an external sustainability consultant in 2017, the Group decided 

the task of monitoring and reporting of the identified material ESG factors in 2018 which is 

strategically important to be completed internally. RIG’s SR Committee, together with its 

different business units, agreed that the issues identified and prioritized in the previous year are 

still most relevant and significant to the Group and its stakeholders.  

 

Linked to the overall strategy and risk management approach, the Environment, Social and 

Governance (ESG) Materiality Assessment performed with the facilitation of the external 

consultant in 2017 was deemed still appropriate and valid for 2018.  

 

 

Material ESG Factors 

 

The material ESG factors for FY2018 remain as follows: 

 

GRI 201 - Economic performance 

GRI 401 – Employment 

GRI 403 – Occupational health and safety 

GRI 404 - Training and education 

 

Should the business scope of RIG expands extensively in the coming years, additional ESG 

factors may be incorporated to reflect increased levels of transparency and corporate 

governance.
