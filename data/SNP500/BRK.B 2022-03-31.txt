BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.
and Subsidiaries
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
March 31, 2022
Note 1. General 
The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms “us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. 
Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, changes in the fair values of certain derivative contract liabilities, gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and the magnitude of asset impairment charges may cause significant variations in periodic net earnings.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect most of our operating businesses. Significant government and private sector actions have been taken since 2020 and likely will continue to be taken intended to control the spread and mitigate the economic effects of the virus. Actions in the latter part of 2021 and early 2022 included temporary business closures or restrictions of business activities in various parts of the world in response to the emergence of variants of the virus. Notwithstanding these efforts, significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs have persisted in 2022. Further, the development of geopolitical conflicts in 2022 have contributed to disruptions of supply chains, resulting in cost increases for commodities, goods, and services in many parts of the world. The economic effects from these events over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods.
Note 2. New accounting pronouncements 
In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts” (“ASU 2018-12”). ASU 2018-12 requires reassessment of cash flow assumptions at least annually and revision of discount rate assumptions each reporting period in valuing policyholder liabilities and related deferred acquisition costs of long-duration contracts. The effects from changes in cash flow assumptions are reflected in earnings and the effects from changes in discount rate assumptions are reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the cash flow and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 is to be applied retrospectively to the earliest period presented in the financial statements, will require new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. 
We currently intend to adopt ASU 2018-12 as of January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective method, which provides that revised cash flow and discount rate assumptions as of January 1, 2021 (the transition date) be applied to contracts then in-force, with liabilities then remeasured as provided under the standard. The cumulative effects from discount rate assumption changes as of the transition date will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and the cumulative effect from cash flow assumption changes will be recorded in retained earnings. While we have not finalized our assessment of the impact of the adoption as of the transition date, we currently believe that the changes in discount rate assumptions will have a greater effect on our recorded liabilities than changes in cash flow assumptions. We also preliminarily estimate that the changes in discount rate assumptions as of the transition date will increase our life, health and annuity benefit liabilities from the amounts previously reported due to the historically low interest rate environment at that time. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2018-12 will be based on the discount rate and cash flow assumptions determined as of the January 1, 2023 adoption date. We, therefore, continue to evaluate the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Note 4. Investments in equity securities (Continued)
Our equity security investments also include Occidental Corporation (“Occidental”) Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $10 billion and warrants to purchase up to 83.86 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $59.62 per share. The preferred stock accrues dividends at 8% per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105% of the liquidation preference, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends and is mandatorily redeemable under specified events. Dividends on the preferred stock are payable in cash or, at Occidental’s option, in shares of Occidental common stock. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. 
Note 5. Equity method investments 
Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Kraft Heinz manufactures and markets food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns 26.6% of the outstanding shares of Kraft Heinz common stock.
We recorded equity method earnings from our investment in Kraft Heinz of $206 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $150 million in 2021. We received dividends on the common stock of $130 million in the first quarter of both 2022 and 2021, which were recorded as reductions to the carrying value of our investment. 
Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $12.8 billion at March 31, 2022 and $11.7 billion at December 31, 2021. The carrying value of our investment was approximately $13.2 billion at March 31, 2022 and $13.1 billion at December 31, 2021. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investment exceeded the fair value based on the quoted market price by 3% of the carrying value. We evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment. Based on the prevailing facts and circumstances, we concluded recognition of an impairment loss in earnings was not required as of March 31, 2022.

Other investments that we account for pursuant to the equity method include Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”), Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (“ETT”) and Iroquois Gas Transmission System L.P. (“Iroquois”). The aggregate carrying value of these investments was approximately $4.4 billion as of March 31, 2022 and $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. We recorded equity method earnings in the first quarter of $170 million in 2022 and $101 million in 2021, and we received aggregate distributions in the first quarter of $28 million in 2022 and $896 million in 2021. Additional information concerning these investments follows. 
We own a 50% interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50% interest. Berkadia provides capital solutions, investment sales advisory and mortgage servicing for multifamily and commercial real estate. A source of funding for Berkadia’s operations is through commercial paper, which was $1.47 billion at March 31, 2022 and is limited to $1.5 billion. Berkadia’s commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) subsidiaries own a 50% noncontrolling interest in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in Texas and a 50% noncontrolling interest in Iroquois, which owns and operates a natural gas pipeline located in New York and Connecticut.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Note 5. Equity method investments (Continued)
We own a 38.6% interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot operates travel centers in North America through more than 800 retail locations across 44 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces and through wholesale distribution. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1% interest in Pilot and a third party owns the remaining 11.3% interest. We have an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot in 2023, with the Haslam family retaining a 20% interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot in 2023.

Equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the period on equity securities we still own, as well as gains and losses on securities we sold during the period. As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds from sales of equity securities of approximately $9.7 billion in the first three months of 2022 and $6.5 billion in the first three months of 2021. In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity securities sold during the period represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable period or, if later, the purchase date. Our taxable gains/losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Taxable losses in the first quarter of 2022 were $739 million and taxable gains in 2021 were $1.8 billion.
Our derivative contract gains and losses derive from equity index put option contracts written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. As of March 31, 2022, we had six open contracts, which had an aggregate fair value liability of $121 million and an aggregate notional value of $2.6 billion.

We are also party to commercial loan agreements with Seritage Growth Properties (“Seritage”) and Lee Enterprises, Inc, (“Lee”), in which loan balances aggregated $1.9 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Seritage loan is pursuant to a $2.0 billion term loan facility and the outstanding loan is secured by mortgages on its real estate properties. The loan agreement with Seritage, as amended, allows optional loan prepayments without penalty and further provides Seritage with the option to extend the maturity of the loan to July 31, 2025, if the outstanding principal has been reduced to $800 million by the original expiration date of July 31, 2023. The loan to Lee matures in 2045. The Lee loan agreement provides for mandatory principal prepayments under certain conditions and optional prepayments at par. We are the sole lender to each of these entities and each of these loans is current as to payment status.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
Note 12. Goodwill and other intangible assets (Continued)
Intangible asset amortization expense in the first quarter was $303 million in 2022 and $319 million in 2021. Intangible assets with indefinite lives were $18.5 billion as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and primarily related to certain customer relationships and trademarks and trade names. 
 
Note 13. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 14), for each of the three-month periods ending March 31, 2022 and 2021 follows (in millions).

Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). Incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are net of reinsurance recoveries. We recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $251 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $646 million in 2021, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in those periods. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 0.3% in 2022 and 0.8% in 2021.
Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years from primary insurance were reduced by $114 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $699 million in 2021. The reductions in 2022 derived primarily from private passenger automobile, medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims, partly offset by increases in ultimate liabilities for other casualty claims. The decrease in incurred losses for prior accident years in 2021 was primarily due to reductions in private passenger automobile estimates, and to a lesser extent in medical professional liability and workers’ compensation estimates. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years related to property and casualty reinsurance decreased $137 million in the first quarter of 2022 and increased $53 million in 2021.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
Note 14. Retroactive reinsurance contracts 
Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, after a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and related deferred charges for each of the three-month periods ending March 31, 2022 and 2021 follow (in millions).

In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts, which reflect when our exposure to losses began. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter for prior years’ contracts were $208 million in 2022 and $247 million in 2021 and included recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effect of changes in the timing and amount of expected future loss payments. Currently, our largest retroactive reinsurance contract is between our subsidiary, National Indemnity Company, and certain subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”). Our estimated claim liabilities with regard to the AIG contract were approximately $15.4 billion at March 31, 2022 and $15.8 billion at December 31, 2021. Deferred charges related to the AIG contract were $4.34 billion at March 31, 2022 and $4.45 billion at December 31, 2021.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
Note 15. Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) 
In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $600 million of maturing senior notes and issued ¥128.5 billion (approximately $1.1 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In March 2022, BHFC issued $4.5 billion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 with a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and €1.25 billion (approximately $1.4 billion) of senior notes maturing in 2030 and 2034 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8%. 
The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€8.15 billion, £1.75 billion and ¥914 billion par at March 31, 2022) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $716 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $720 million in the first quarter of 2021. 
Berkshire also guarantees debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $3.8 billion at March 31, 2022. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations.

BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure such debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. In April 2022, BHE issued $1.0 billion of 4.6% senior notes due in 2053 and a subsidiary issued £350 million of 3.25% bonds due in 2052.
BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. As of March 31, 2022, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. 
Our subsidiaries have unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Unused lines of credit were approximately $10.4 billion at March 31, 2022, which included approximately $8.8 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
Note 16. Fair value measurements (Continued)
The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. 
Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. 
Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. 
Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. 
Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 follow (in millions).

Investments in equity securities in the preceding table include our investments in certain preferred stocks and common stock warrants that do not have readily determinable market values as defined under GAAP. These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and may contain provisions that prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants.

Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equal to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,470,875 shares outstanding as of March 31, 2022 and 1,477,429 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021. 
Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times the average Class A shares outstanding. 
Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $30 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. 
Note 18. Income taxes 
Our consolidated effective income tax rates were 18.0% in the first quarter 2022 and 18.5% in the first quarter of 2021. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, the magnitude of gains or losses with respect to our investments in equity securities, the amount of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions.

Note 21. Contingencies and commitments 
We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
On March 21, 2022, Berkshire and Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”) entered into an agreement whereby Berkshire will acquire all of Alleghany’s outstanding common stock for cash of approximately $11.6 billion. The acquisition of Alleghany is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2022 and is subject to approval by Alleghany shareholders and the receipt of various regulatory approvals. Alleghany owns property and casualty reinsurance and insurance businesses as well as a diverse portfolio of non-financial businesses.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
Note 22. Revenues from contracts with customers 
We recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. The following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 (in millions). Other revenues, which are not considered to be revenues from contracts with customers under GAAP, are primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
Note 23. Business segment data 
Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines and marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. Revenues and earnings before income taxes by segment for the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions).

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in numerous diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. 
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect most of our operating businesses. Significant government and private sector actions have been taken since 2020 and likely will continue to be taken to control the spread and mitigate the economic effects of the virus. Actions in the latter part of 2021 and early 2022 included periodic temporary business closures or restrictions of business activities in various parts of the world in response to the emergence of variants of the virus. Notwithstanding these efforts, significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs have persisted. Further, the development of geopolitical conflicts in 2022 have contributed to the disruptions of supply chains, resulting in cost increases for goods and services in many parts of the world. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of these events on our businesses or when our operations will normalize. Nor can we reliably predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. 
Insurance underwriting produced after-tax earnings of $47 million in the first quarter of 2022 versus $764 million in 2021. Underwriting earnings in the first quarter of 2022 were negatively impacted by ongoing increases in claims severities at GEICO. Underwriting earnings in 2021 reflected the effects of the premium reductions from the GEICO Giveback program and the favorable impact of lower claims frequencies for private passenger automobile coverages, which were partially offset by higher claims severities. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income decreased 3.1% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to lower dividend income. 
After-tax earnings of our railroad business increased 9.6% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The increase reflected higher revenue per car/unit, partly offset by lower overall freight volumes and higher average fuel costs. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 6.7% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The increase reflected higher earnings from the regulated utilities businesses, including increased production tax credits for renewable energy, and from higher earnings from tax equity investments, partly offset by lower earnings from the natural gas pipelines and real estate brokerage businesses. After-tax earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 15.5% in the first quarter of 2022 versus 2021. While customer demand for products and services was relatively good in the first quarter of 2022, we continue to experience the effects of higher materials, freight, labor and other input costs attributable to ongoing disruptions in global supply chains. 
Investment and derivative contract gains and losses in 2022 and 2021 predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and includes unrealized gains and losses from market price changes. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings.
23

 
Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Insurance—Underwriting 
Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett, and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the quarterly or annual operating results of our insurance businesses. 
The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider incurred losses exceeding $100 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Significant catastrophe events in the first quarters included floods in Australia in 2022 and Winter Storm Uri in 2021. 
Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $125 billion as of March 31, 2022. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
Underwriting results of certain of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses have been affected by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including incremental provisions for claims. The effects of the pandemic on future periods may be affected by judicial rulings and regulatory and legislative actions pertaining to insurance coverage and claims and by its effects on general economic activity, which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time. 
We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions).

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)
GEICO (Continued)
GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting loss in the first quarter of 2022 reflected increased claims severity, primarily due to significant cost inflation in automobile markets, which accelerated in the second half of 2021. Increases in used car prices are producing increased claims severities on total losses and shortages of car parts are contributing to increased claims severity on partial losses. In addition, injury claims severities continue to trend higher than general inflation rates. 
Premiums written in the first quarter of 2022 increased $259 million (2.6%) compared to 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average premiums per auto policy due to rate increases, as average policies in-force were relatively unchanged. Premiums earned in the first quarter of 2022 increased $631 million (7.1%) compared to 2021. Premiums earned in 2021 included a reduction of approximately $400 million attributable to the remaining impact of the GEICO Giveback program that provided a 15% premium credit to new and renewing voluntary auto and motorcycle policies written between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020. 
Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter of 2022 increased $2.1 billion (32.2%) compared to 2021. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned in the first quarter of 2022 was 89.4%, an increase of 17.0 percentage points compared to 2021, which reflected increases in claims frequencies and severities.
Claims frequencies in the first quarter of 2022 were higher for all coverages, including property damage (ten to eleven percent range), collision (fifteen to sixteen percent range), bodily injury (twelve to thirteen percent range) and personal injury (fourteen to fifteen percent range). Average claims severities in the first quarter of 2022 were higher for property damage coverage (six to seven percent range), collision coverage (twenty to twenty-two percent range) and bodily injury coverage (nine to eleven percent range). GEICO’s losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter included reductions in the ultimate claim loss estimates for prior years’ loss events of $92 million in 2022 and $521 million in 2021. The reduction in estimates for prior years’ events in 2022 reflected decreases for bodily and personal injury coverages and increases for collision and property damage coverages.
Underwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2022 were $1.2 billion, a decrease of $249 million (17.3%) compared to 2021, reflecting lower employee-related and advertising expenses. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) in the first quarter of 2022 was 12.5% compared to 16.1% in 2021, attributable to both the decrease in expenses as well as the increase in earned premiums.
Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 
The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare professional liability, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. BH Primary’s larger insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”) and U.S. Liability Insurance Company (“USLI”).

Premiums written increased $484 million (16.6%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increases at nearly all of our larger insurance units, including BH Specialty (28%), BHHC (12%) and USLI (17%). The increases were across multiple coverages and occurred in several markets.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)
Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (Continued)
BH Primary’s loss ratio was 72.9% in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 3.2 percentage points compared to 2021. Losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to significant catastrophe events were $75 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $150 million in 2021. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were reduced $22 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $178 million in 2021 for net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events. BH Primary insurers also write significant levels of workers’ compensation, commercial and professional liability insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. We could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. 
Underwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2022 increased $153 million (25.5%) compared to 2021. Our expense ratio also increased 1.6 percentage points compared to 2021. These increases reflected costs associated with new business development and changes in business mix. 
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group 
The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), General Reinsurance Corporation and General Reinsurance AG. We also write life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”). We periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts through BHLN. 
Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the claim liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of BHRG’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)
Property/casualty (Continued)
Premiums written in the first quarter of 2022 were relatively unchanged from 2021, reflecting a modest net increase from volumes and rates, offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased $100 million (4.2%) and the loss ratio declined 3.0 percentage points in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Losses incurred arising from significant catastrophe events in the first quarter of 2022 were $315 million, which were partially offset by reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $137 million. Losses incurred in the first quarter of 2021 included $310 million from significant catastrophe events and an increase in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $53 million. Underwriting expenses are primarily commissions and brokerage costs. The expense ratio decreased 4.0 percentage points in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to changes in business mix and foreign currency effects.

Life/health premiums written decreased $58 million (4.5%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to lower volumes in the Asia Pacific and North America regions and from unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Life and health benefits in the first quarter of 2022 declined $200 million (16.0%) compared to 2021, attributable to lower mortality. Underwriting results in 2021 were affected by significant, pandemic-related increases in mortality in the U.S., South Africa and Latin America, which were partially offset by lower underwriting expenses, due mainly to lower average commission rates in the international life business. 
Retroactive reinsurance 
Pre-tax underwriting losses in each period derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 were insignificant. Pre-tax underwriting losses in the first quarter before foreign currency exchange effects were $195 million in 2022 and $243 million in 2021. 
Unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $37.7 billion at March 31, 2022, declining $554 million since December 31, 2021, primarily due to loss payments. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $10.4 billion at March 31, 2022, a decline of $215 million since December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to periodic amortization. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods. 
Periodic payment annuity 
Periodic payment annuity premiums earned increased $25 million (17.4%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. Our volumes written may change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) 
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)
Periodic payment annuity (Continued)
Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from the effects of changes in mortality and interest rates and from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results in the first quarter included foreign currency gains of $44 million in 2022 and losses of $10 million in 2021.
Excluding foreign currency exchange gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses in the first quarter were $147 million in 2022 compared to $126 million in 2021. The increase in pre-tax losses reflected the effects of new business and lower mortality. Discounted annuity liabilities were $15.3 billion at March 31, 2022 and had a weighted average discount rate of approximately 3.9%. 
Variable annuity 
Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of $56 million in 2022 and $121 million in 2021. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting earnings in each period were primarily attributable to the net effects of interest rate changes and in 2022 were partly offset by unfavorable changes in securities markets.

Interest and other investment income increased 3.1% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. While exceptionally low interest rates prevailed in recent years, rates began to increase in the first quarter of 2022. The effects of such increases are expected to be reflected in our earnings as maturing investments are replaced by new investments. We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. 
Dividend income in the first quarter of 2022 decreased 4.5% compared to 2021. Dividend income may vary from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees. Dividend income in the first quarter included $16 million in 2022 and $38 million in 2021 from investments in preferred stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Such amounts are deducted from earnings of the utilities and energy segment. 
Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums receivable, reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $148 billion at March 31, 2022 and $147 billion at December 31, 2021. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, and consequently, the average cost of float for each period was negative.

Railroad operating revenues increased 10.6% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a 13.8% increase in average revenue per car/unit resulting from higher fuel surcharge revenue driven by higher fuel prices, along with increased rates per car/unit, partially offset by a 3.3% decrease in unit volume. Pre-tax earnings were $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 9.0% compared to 2021. 
Operating revenues from consumer products were $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 10.3% from 2021. The increase reflected higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by lower volumes of 8.5%. The volume decrease was mainly from lower international intermodal shipments resulting from supply chain challenges and lower automotive shipments due to production impacts from a global microchip shortage, partially offset by an increase in domestic intermodal volumes.
Operating revenues from industrial products were $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 5.8% from 2021. Volumes increased 1.3% in the first quarter along with higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to improvement in the U.S. industrial economy.
Operating revenues from agricultural products were $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 3.7% compared to 2021, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by decreased volumes of 4.1%. The volume decrease was primarily due to lower grain exports, partially offset by higher volumes of ethanol and related commodities. 
Operating revenues from coal were $889 million in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 29.6% from 2021, attributable to higher volumes of 13.6%, as well as from higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase in 2022 derived from increased electricity generation, higher natural gas prices and improved export demand.
Railroad operating expenses were $3.7 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of $408 million (12.3%) compared to 2021, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits and fuel expenses. Our ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues in the first quarter of 2022 increased 0.9 percentage points to 64.6% versus 2021. 
Compensation and benefits expenses increased $60 million (5.2%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to wage inflation, health and welfare costs and lower productivity. Fuel expenses increased $311 million (56.5%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher average fuel prices. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $35 million (7.1%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to increased general inflation and higher casualty costs.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Utilities and Energy 
We currently own 91.1% ownership interest in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests include PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. BHE subsidiaries also operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid in Great Britain. BHE’s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (“LNG interest”), which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects and investments. BHE also operates a residential real estate brokerage business and a large network of residential real estate brokerage franchises in the United States. 
The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are largely based on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions).

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Utilities and Energy (Continued)
PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. After-tax earnings decreased $39 million in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease reflected higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales). The increase in operating expenses reflected incremental costs from additional assets placed in-service as well as higher thermal plant maintenance costs.
PacifiCorp’s utility margin was $832 million in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of $14 million from 2021. The increase reflected higher retail revenue from increases in customer volumes and favorable price impacts, and higher wholesale and other revenue, partially offset by higher purchased power and thermal generation costs. Retail customer volumes increased 1.9% in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, the favorable impact of weather and higher customer usage.
MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings increased $97 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The increase reflected higher electric utility margin and increased income tax benefits, partly offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses included incremental costs associated with additional wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service. The income tax benefit increase was mainly due to higher production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service and the impacts of ratemaking. 
MEC’s electric utility margin was $483 million in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 23% versus 2021. The increase was attributable to higher operating revenue from favorable retail and wholesale customer volumes and lower purchased power costs. Electric retail customer volumes increased 5.6% in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, higher customer usage and the favorable impact of weather.
NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings decreased $5 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease reflected higher operating expenses from increased plant operations and maintenance expenses and a higher comparative accrual for earnings sharing.
NV Energy’s electric utility margin was $306 million in the first quarter of 2022, relatively unchanged compared to 2021. Electric retail customer volumes increased 4.0% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers and higher customer usage, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of weather.
Northern Powergrid’s after-tax earnings increased $7 million in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase reflected the impacts of higher distribution revenue, mainly from increased tariff rates, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2022. 
Natural gas pipelines’ after-tax earnings decreased $74 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was largely due to higher margins on natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue in the first quarter of 2021 due to an increase in demand as a result of the February 2021 winter storms. 
Other energy businesses’ after-tax earnings increased $111 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in earnings was primarily due to improved wind tax equity investment earnings of $118 million. The increase in wind tax equity investment earnings was primarily due to losses on pre-existing tax equity investments in the first quarter of 2021 due to the February 2021 winter storms, as well as from increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months.
Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings decreased $63 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease in earnings was primarily attributable to lower earnings from mortgage services due to a decrease in funded volume and in refinancing activity, and to a lesser extent lower earnings from brokerage and settlement services from a decrease in closed units at existing companies.

Industrial products 
The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)) and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products).

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)
Industrial products (Continued)
Revenues of the industrial products group in the first quarter of 2022 increased $803 million (12.0%) compared to 2021 while pre-tax earnings increased $74 million (6.5%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 16.3% for the first quarter of 2022, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points compared to 2021. 
PCC’s revenues were $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 12.7% over the first quarter of 2021.  PCC derives significant revenues and earnings from sales of aerospace products. The revenue increase in 2022 reflected higher aerospace product revenues and relatively unchanged revenues from power and other industrial products. While commercial air travel continues to increase in both the U.S. and international markets, traffic remains below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, especially for international routes. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel. However, further recovery likely will continue to be uneven, attributable in part to travel restrictions imposed from time-to-time to control the spread of variants of the virus. Commercial aircraft delivery rates by original equipment manufacturers appear to be increasing, most notably for narrow-body aircraft, although Boeing’s growth is constrained by the lack of certification of the Boeing 737 MAX in China. In addition, the pause in deliveries of the Boeing 787 due to production quality issues further impacts aerospace growth.
PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased $16 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting the impact of increased revenues, partially offset by a $13 million reduction in pension plan income. The improvement in operating results also reflects the continual actions taken by management to improve operations and to prepare for more normalized demand for PCC’s products. We do not currently expect PCC’s aerospace revenues or earnings will increase significantly in the near term, primarily due to the expected lag in recovery of PCC’s manufacturing levels as a result of inventory levels within the supply chain for Boeing, and the potential for delays with the certification of the Boeing 737 MAX in China and the resumption of Boeing 787 production. 
Lubrizol’s revenues were approximately $1.65 billion in the first quarter of 2022, a decrease of 2.5% compared to 2021. The decrease reflects lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher average selling prices. Sales volumes in the first quarter of 2022 were restricted by raw material supply constraints and unplanned temporary maintenance shutdowns, which limited Lubrizol’s production capabilities. The increase in average selling prices was due to escalating prices for raw materials, including oil feedstocks, as well as for utilities, packaging, shipping and freight costs.
Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings decreased 39.8% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 were negatively impacted by rising raw material costs and lower sales volumes and higher expenses arising from the unplanned temporary shutdowns. Earnings in the first quarter of 2021 were negatively impacted by the weather-related temporary shutdown of Additives facilities in the U.S., which resulted in various incremental and non-recurring operating costs and lost sales margins. 
Marmon’s revenues were $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 26.2% compared to 2021, with nearly all business groups generating meaningful revenue increases. In particular, aggregate revenues in the first quarter of 2022 from the Electrical, Metal Services and Transportation groups increased 39% compared to 2021, attributable to higher average metals prices and sales volumes. These groups contributed over half of Marmon’s revenue increase. 
Marmon’s pre-tax earnings increased 43.8% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting higher earnings from most business groups, partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing and Medical groups. The Electrical, Transportation and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups generated the largest increases in earnings in the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher sales volumes and improved operating margins.
IMC’s revenues were $960 million in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 8.5% compared to 2021. Revenues in the first quarter of 2022 reflected increased sales in most geographic regions, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased 8.3% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021, attributable to higher customer demand, partially offset by higher raw material costs and other operating expenses and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects.
Building products 
The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek).

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)
Building products (Continued)
Revenues of the building products group increased $1.1 billion (19.3%) in the first quarter of 2022 and pre-tax earnings increased $374 million (48.6%) compared to 2021. Residential housing construction demand in the U.S. continued to be relatively strong in the first quarter of 2022. We continue to be negatively affected by persistent supply chain disruptions, which limited our sales and contributed to production delays in some areas and contributed to significant cost increases for many raw materials and other inputs, including energy, freight and labor. These effects necessitated sales price increases. In the first quarter of 2022, interest rates in the U.S. increased significantly compared to the previous low-rate environment. Significant increases in mortgage interest rates will likely slow demand for new housing construction, which could adversely impact our businesses.
Clayton Homes’ revenues increased 21.3% to approximately $2.8 billion in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from home sales increased $470 million (26.6%), primarily due to higher average selling prices and changes in sales mix. New home unit sales increased 4.3% in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting higher factory-built manufactured home unit and essentially unchanged site-built home unit sales. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 3.8% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $19.4 billion as of March 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $600 million from December 31, 2021. 
Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes increased $94 million (24.0%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 reflected higher home sales, gross margins and net interest income and relatively low credit losses, partially offset by the impact of rising manufacturing and supply chain costs. 
Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $3.9 billion in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of $592 million (17.8%) versus 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices driven by higher input and transportation costs, and to a lesser extent, from higher unit volumes and product mix changes for paint and coatings and commercial flooring, and strength in residential and retail insulation, commercial roofing systems and engineered products. These volume increases were partially offset by lower residential flooring products volumes. 
Pre-tax earnings of our other building products businesses increased $280 million (73.9%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021. Earnings as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter of 2022 increased 5.4 percentage points versus 2021. Earnings in 2022 benefitted from a pre-tax gain of $94 million from a business divestiture. The increase in earnings in 2022 also reflected the impact of severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021, which reduced sales and produced incremental production and other operating costs. Customer demand was generally strong in 2022. However, earnings were negatively impacted from the lack of availability of certain materials and other product inputs from supply chain disruptions. 
Consumer products 
The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and high-performance batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline).
Consumer products revenues increased approximately $621 million (17.2%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from Forest River increased 40.1% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, driven by higher average selling prices and a 6.5% increase in unit sales. Revenues of our other consumer products businesses in 2022 were generally lower than the first quarter of 2021, including a 3.5% decrease from apparel and footwear, as well as lower revenues from Duracell. These decreases reflected lower sales volumes, partly attributable to reduced inventory availability arising from production slowdowns in Asia, inbound freight delays and shortages of certain raw materials, partly offset by higher average selling prices.
Pre-tax earnings of our consumer products group declined $60 million (11.5%) in the first quarter of 2022 versus 2021 and pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 3.5 percentage points in 2022 compared to 2021. The decline in earnings reflected lower earnings from the apparel and footwear businesses and Duracell, partially offset by higher earnings from Forest River. Aggregate earnings from Duracell and the apparel and footwear businesses declined about 50% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. These declines were attributable to significant increases in raw material, freight, labor and other operating costs and the impact of reduced sales volumes.

Service 
Our service group consists of several businesses. The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). 
Service group revenues increased $918 million (25.5%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from TTI increased 28.9% in the first quarter of 2022 versus the first quarter of 2021, reflecting strong demand in nearly all significant markets. Revenues from aviation services (NetJets and FlightSafety) increased 23.5% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increased training hours (38%), customer flight hours (36%) and fuel surcharges due to significant increases in fuel prices, partially offset by the effects from changes in sales mix. 
Pre-tax earnings of the service group increased $134 million (22.7%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues decreased 0.4 percentage points in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The earnings increase reflected increases from TTI, partially offset by lower earnings from aviation services. The earnings increase from TTI was primarily attributable to the increase in sales and improved operating cost leverage. The earnings decrease from aviation services was attributable to higher subcontracted flight, equipment maintenance and other operating costs, which more than offset the increase in revenues. 
Retailing 
Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”), representing 65% of our combined retailing revenue in the first quarter of 2022. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 20% of the combined retailing revenues in the first quarter of 2022. 
Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. 
36

 
Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) 
Retailing (Continued)
Retailing group revenues increased approximately $239 million (5.5%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. BHA’s revenues in the first quarter of 2022 increased 9.5% over the first quarter of 2021, with vehicle sales, service and repair, and finance and service contract revenues each increasing versus 2021. The increase in vehicle sales was primarily attributable to higher average vehicle transaction prices, partly offset by lower unit sales. Unit sales continue to be constrained by low new vehicle production by original equipment manufacturers, attributable to the ongoing global computer chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. Home furnishings group revenues increased 1.6% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to higher average selling prices and lower transaction volumes. 
Retailing group pre-tax earnings increased $63 million (18.1%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 27.4% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to increases in vehicle sales margins and finance and service contract earnings per vehicle sold, lower floorplan interest expense and from operating cost control efforts. Pre-tax earnings from BHA’s dealership operations increased 41.5% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased $18 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher earnings from the jewelry retailers, partly offset by lower earnings from the furniture retailers and Pampered Chef.
McLane Company 
McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised 62% of McLane’s consolidated sales in the first quarter of 2022, with foodservice representing most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. 
Revenues increased $893 million (7.7%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increases of 3.6% from the grocery business and 15.9% from the foodservice business. Pre-tax earnings decreased $21 million (20.4%) in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, which was primarily attributable to higher personnel costs and fuel expense, partly offset by a slight increase in the average gross sales margin rate. McLane’s grocery and food service operating results continue to be adversely affected by upstream supply chain constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages, higher inventory costs and disruptions in inventory availability. These upstream supply chain effects, together with the personnel shortages that we have been experiencing, adversely affected our customer service levels and reduced our operating efficiencies. The increase in fuel expense was primarily attributable to significant increases in petroleum prices. We expect the current difficult operating environment to continue through 2022.

Investment gains/losses 
Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Pre-tax investment gains/losses in the first quarter included net unrealized losses of $1.8 billion in 2022 and net unrealized gains of $4.6 billion in 2021 on securities we held at the end of the applicable period. Taxable investment gains/losses on equity securities sold in the first quarter, which is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were losses of $739 million in 2022 and gains of $1.8 billion in 2021.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Investment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses (Continued)
Investment gains/losses (Continued)
We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. 
Derivative contract gains/losses 
Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts that were originated before March of 2008. As of March 31, 2022, the vast majority of these contracts have expired. The gains and losses from the changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant due to the volatility of market prices in the related equity securities markets. As of March 31, 2022, the intrinsic value of our remaining equity index put option contracts was $84 million and our recorded liability at fair value was $121 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under these contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined in the contracts.

After-tax equity method earnings include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia, Electric Transmission of Texas and Iroquois Gas Transmission Systems. Earnings in the first quarter of 2022 increased $93 million versus 2021, primarily due to higher earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz and Pilot. 
After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions 
Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt and BHFC’s Euro and Great Britain Pound denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Berkshire corporate items consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and unallocated income taxes. 
Financial Condition 
Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity attributable to Berkshire shareholders at March 31, 2022 was $508.1 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion since December 31, 2021. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $5.5 billion in the first quarter of 2022, which included after-tax losses on our investments of $1.4 billion. Investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities will produce significant volatility in our earnings. 
Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $3.2 billion in the first quarter of 2022 to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Financial Condition (Continued)
At March 31, 2022, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $102.7 billion, which included $74.1 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $412.3 billion. During the first quarter of 2022, we paid cash of $51.1 billion to acquire equities securities and we received proceeds of $9.7 billion from sales of equity securities. 
Our consolidated borrowings at March 31, 2022 were $119.7 billion, of which over 95% were by the Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. In the first quarter of 2022, Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries issued term debt of approximately $7.4 billion in the aggregate. 
Berkshire parent company outstanding debt outstanding at March 31, 2022 was $21.3 billion, a decrease of $122 million since December 31, 2021. In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $600 million of maturing senior notes and issued ¥128.5 billion (approximately $1.1 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. Berkshire’s borrowings decreased $650 million in the first quarter of 2022 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on its non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Aggregate maturities of Berkshire parent company debt over the next twelve months approximates $3.9 billion, all of which is in the first quarter of 2023. 
Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were $23.6 billion at March 31, 2022, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $18.9 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. In March 2022, BHFC issued $4.5 billion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and issued €1.25 billion of senior notes maturing in 2030 and 2034 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8%. Aggregate maturities of BHFC debt in the second quarter of 2022 are $775 million. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. 
BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.0 billion as of March 31, 2022, a decrease of $201 million from December 31, 2021. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $51.8 billion at March 31, 2022, substantially unchanged from December 31, 2021. In April 2022, BHE issued $1.0 billion of 4.6% senior notes due in 2053 and a subsidiary issued £350 million of 3.25% notes due in 2052. Aggregate debt maturities for BHE and BNSF over the next twelve months approximate $2.6 billion. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries.
In the first quarter of 2022, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of approximately $6.8 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $3.1 billion in the first quarter of 2022, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (BNSF and BHE) of $2.2 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast additional capital expenditures of approximately $9.4 billion over the remainder of 2022. 
Contractual Obligations 
We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. 
We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $125 billion at March 31, 2022. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from any forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows.
Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of March 31, 2022, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF and aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Contractual Obligations (Continued)
On March 21, 2022, we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”) common stock for cash consideration of approximately $11.6 billion, subject to Alleghany shareholder approval and receipt of various regulatory approvals. We currently anticipate this acquisition will close in the fourth quarter of 2022. We also have an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4% of Pilot in 2023 and agreements to acquire certain non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, which are described in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2022 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
Critical Accounting Policies 
Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2022 includes estimated liabilities of $125.4 billion for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. 
Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2022 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.8 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.5 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2021. In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2021, the estimated fair values of five reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”). The estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $34.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $31.1 billion by 10.7%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the four other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $2.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $2.3 billion by 9.2%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.2 billion.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. 
As of March 31, 2022, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The long-term adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of our reporting units may prove to be worse than we currently anticipate, and we may need to record goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units and judgments on goodwill impairments at this time are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on a reporting unit’s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. 
Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Forward-Looking Statements 
Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. 
Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities; losses realized from derivative contracts; the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber-attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations; the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates; the adverse impacts from geopolitical events; changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries; changes in federal income tax laws; and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. 
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the “Market Risk Disclosures” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of March 31, 2022, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. 
Part II Other Information
Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
Item 1A. Risk Factors 
Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, to which reference is made herein. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results could result in a decline in the value of our securities and the loss of all or part of your investment.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities 
Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the first quarter of 2022 follows.

The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $30 billion.
