DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

Sheng Siong is a leading retailer of fresh produce 

and daily essentials in Singapore. To stay relevant 

and responsive to the needs of our stakeholders, 

Sheng Siong takes a proactive approach to engage 

our stakeholders and keep abreast on issues that 

matter to them. In the process of reviewing and 

refining our material sustainability issues, we were 

able to align our business perspectives with that of 

our stakeholders’ and incorporate sustainability as 

a strategy to manage emerging risks and challenges 

posed to our business. 

Our efforts in adopting sustainable growth 

strategies and placing sustainability at the heart of 

our strategy and operations were recognised when 

we were awarded the Best Inaugural Sustainability 

Report in the Mainboard category by The Singapore 

Sustainability Reporting Awards. 

We opened ten new outlets in 2018, bringing 

the Group’s total number of retail outlets to 54, 

further strengthening our foothold in Singapore’s 

heartland. We opened our first retail outlet outside 

Singapore in November 2017. The store is located 



in Kunming, Yunnan, China and has a retail area of 

approximately 50,000 square feet. We will continue 

to build the Sheng Siong brand in Kunming and will 

widen our market coverage by opening a second 

store, also in Kunming in 3Q2019.

The extension of our central warehouse in Mandai 

is expected to be completed by end 2019, a delay 

over the original targeted completion date of 

1Q2019.

Contributing to the Group’s growth is our 

commitment to the company’s core values and 

principles in fulfilling the demands of our customers 

sustainably. Our sustainability journey is built on 

five key pillars:

1. Business Excellence

2. Care for our Customers

3. Care for our Employees

4. Care for the Community

5. Care for the Environment

Each pillar represents Sheng Siong’s commitments 

to create a sustainable and positive impact in the 

business, the workplace, the community and the 

environment.

BUSINESS EXCELLENCE 

Our stakeholders view strategic growth, financial 

performance, capital and risk management, and 

sound governance as hallmarks of an excellent 

business. The Group persists in striving for business 

excellence in our value chain which is critical for 

the sustainability of our business in a competitive 

and ever-changing environment. This includes 

containing and reducing costs via productivity 

and process improvements and investing in 

technology. This approach has been accentuated 

by the need to replace labour with capital and 

has been validated by the recent tightening of the 

quotas for the employment of foreign workers by 

the Government in Singapore.

Since introduced in 2015, we have successfully rolled 

out our Hybrid Self-Checkout System (“HSCO”) in 

47 stores and aim for complete implementation by 

the first half of 2019. The HSCO has allowed us to 

successfully reduce each customer’s waiting time 

at checkout by more than 30 seconds, and freed 

up cashiers and tellers to take on roles that enlarge 

the scope of their responsibilities and skill sets.

In 2018, we launched the first “recycling” cash 

withdrawal machine in Singapore, which we call 

“$tm”, in our stores at ITE College Central and Block 

417 Fernvale Link. We top up the $tm machines 

with cash from our supermarkets’ sales, and users 

can withdraw money from their bank accounts 

using their DBS, POSB, OCBC or UOB ATM cards. 

This reduces the amount of cash to be collected 

daily and deposited at the bank by our cash 

handling service provider, thereby saving us some 

cash handling charges. Nationally, this should 

improve productivity as cash is recycled at our 

stores, eliminating the leg where it is transferred 

to the banks and then back to their ATMs. These 

machines are scheduled to be installed in all of our 

stores by end May 2019. This may sound counter-

intuitive as we move towards a cashless society, 

but realistically, we think that cash will still be used, 

albeit with a diminished role.

The Group’s CEO, Mr Lim Hock Chee, has also 

been a member of the MAS Payment Council since 

August 2017, helping to steer future e-payment 

solutions in Singapore. We pioneered to pilot-test 

some of these solutions such as the NETs QR code 

in 20 of our stores. The success of this pilot test 

will see us launch the NETs QR code across all our 

stores by the first half of 2019. With an additional 

cashless payment option, we are heeding the call 

to move towards a cashless society.

Given the size of our retail network, we reap 

economies of scale from the improvements in 

operational efficiencies and business processes. 

This strengthens our commitment to being 

a forerunner in adopting new processes and 

technologies 

that 

improve 

productivity 

and 

simplify workflow. Our efforts in these areas were 

acknowledged when we were awarded the SPRING 

Innovation Excellence Award in 2015.

Along with the digital transformation of our 

business comes the increasing threat of cyber 

security vulnerabilities. We recognise the growing 

risk and have taken steps to secure and protect 

our digital infrastructure for the viability of our 

business.





Complete implementation of the HSCO is targeted 

for the first half of 2019.

CARE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS



“This company does not have a 

boss; there is only staff. The customer 

is the real boss. That’s why I have been 

reminding my working companions not to 

be mistaken about who their boss is.”

– Mr Lim Hock Chee BBM

CEO

Our customers represent a significant portion 

of the community at large. They view food and 

product safety, customer satisfaction, healthy diet 

options and affordability of daily necessities as the 

most material aspects of our operations.

Food Safety and Quality

Food safety has always been our main priority. 

Good maintenance of the cold chain is important 

for preserving the safety, freshness, shelf life, and 

quality of fresh and chilled food while reducing 

wastage arising from spoilage throughout the 

supply chain.

Not only are our processing departments ISO 

22000:2005 Food Safety Management System 

certified, our management is also well represented 

in government-initiated working groups, task 

forces, and committees that keep us updated on 

new developments in food safety standards and 

practices.

In 2018, there were a few major food incidents in 

Singapore that remind us of the increasing needs 

to improve our safeguards for food safety and 

security – listeria-contaminated rockmelons and 

strawberries with pins from Australia, and iceberg 

lettuce with high pesticide residues from Malaysia. 

In all these cases, we work proactively with our 

government to provide information transparently 

and conduct product recalls. Together with our 

suppliers, we heighten food safety and security 

checks and strive to communicate openly with our 

customers.

Healthy Singapore

According to SingHealth1, due to environmental 

and genetic factors, certain health concerns have 

a higher prevalence rate in Singapore as compared 

to other countries: myopia, colorectal cancer, nose 

cancer, Type 2 diabetes and thalassemia. Where 

health has become an increasing concern, our 

customers are more discerning with their food 

choices.  

To encourage customers to make healthier choices 

during their daily grocery shopping, we partner 

the Health Promotion Board (HPB) in campaigns 

such as the “Eat, Drink, Shop Healthy Challenge” 

where they are awarded Healthpoints with every 

Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS) product purchased. 

These points can then be used to redeem grocery 

shopping vouchers. We plan to expand on the 

range and selection of our HCS products in the 

years to come.

Other initiatives that we support to promote 

a healthy lifestyle include “World No Tobacco 

Day” and “National Steps ChallengeTM Corporate 

Challenge.” 

Affordability of Daily Necessities

We continue to work closely with government 

agencies in keeping watch on excessive price 

increases of daily necessities, for example by 

diversification in our sourcing and procurement 

strategy to ensure a sustainable supply of food and 

products at a stable price.

Since 2015, we have supported the SG50 Seniors 

Programme by giving a special 3% discount every 

Wednesday for senior citizens aged 60 and above. 

At Sheng Siong, we strive to provide the best value 

in a basket of goods.

CARE FOR OUR EMPLOYEES 

Employees view competitive reward and recognition 

of work effort, opportunities for career progression, 

learning and development, job stability, and good 

leadership as the important factors to motivate 

them to outstanding performance.

The three topics covered under this pillar have stood 

out stronger in this year’s materiality assessment - 

Employee Engagement and Development, Inclusive 

Workplace and Occupational Health, Safety and 

Well-being.

Sheng Siong employs about 2850 employees in 

Singapore as of 31st Dec 2018, an 11% increase 

in the workforce as compared to 2017. This is 

primarily due to the rapid expansion of the Group

with an addition of ten new stores in the year. The 

rapid expansion of the Group coupled with the 

tightened foreign workers policy has resulted in a 

manpower strain.

However, Sheng Siong remains committed to the 

training and skills upgrading of our staff. There 

is a strong emphasis on on-the-job training due 

to the nature of our business, and we believe 

this shall remain the foundation of our training 

method as learning through role-modelling and 

from experience is fundamental to our operational 

effectiveness. That said, we still have improvements 

to make, and this includes formalising our training 

procedures 

and 

assessment 

and 

adopting 

e-learning as a training platform to be more 

accessible and effective.  We are in the progress 

of building a training supermarket within the new 

extension of our HQ cum distribution centre by 

2021.

Our employees are our key assets, and it is 

paramount that their safety, health and well-

being are looked after. Workplace Safety and 

Health (WSH) committees have been established 

to monitor and address workplace safety and 

health risks within our company. We continue to 

pledge our commitment to building an inclusive 

and familial working environment that is safe for 

everyone.

We show our appreciation towards our employees 

via a fair remuneration system and recognition 

programmes. 

Last 

year, 

our 

controlling 

shareholders Mr Lim Hock Eng, Mr Lim Hock Chee 

and Mr Lim Hock Leng disbursed, out of their own 

pockets, annual education grants amounting to 

$506,800. The beneficiaries were 577 children of 

our lower-salaried employees.

We were filled with pride when a record-breaking 

number of 15 employees received their long service 

award for 20 years of service to the Group in 2018.

CARE FOR THE COMMUNITY 

Sheng Siong strongly believes that we should always 

give back to society with gratitude. Every year, we 

make an effort to provide financial assistance as 

well as sponsorships in-kind, lending our hands to 

those who are less fortunate. The spirit of giving 

has been well-embraced by the Group through 

care for the community, for our customers, and 

our employees. These have been material aspects 

of our operations since our inception.

Some of our community initiatives last year 

included the following:

Project R.I.C.E.+ 2018

We supplied about 25,615 hampers of food, 

toiletries and household items for the needy 

through Project R.I.C.E.+ 2018. This marked our 

6th consecutive year of collaboration with the 

Red Cross Youth. We assisted in preparing the 

hampers for distribution to 20,000 beneficiaries 

from skipped-generation families, single-parent 

households and low-income households.

Mother’s Day Charity Walk

This is our 3rd year of support for the 

#ILoveYouMumChallenge 

campaign 

organised 

by Mediacorp. The campaign is a transmedia 

social movement that aims to strengthen family 

ties by challenging children of all ages to express 

their feelings for their mothers via social media 

video with the hashtag #ILoveYouMumChallenge. 

This year, the campaign expanded to include the 

Mother’s Day Charity Walk which comprises of a 

carnival where half of ticket sales proceeds went to 

AWWA, a beneficiary of Mediacorp Cares.

Heartwarmers Volunteer Group

In 2018, we continued to partner with Heartwarmers 

Volunteer Group to build and expand the ground-

up initiative called “Project 100=50”. This was the 

second year we participated in the project, which 

was originally a collaboration between multiple 

parties, including Henderson-Dawson CCC, Nee 

Soon Central Grassroots Organisations and Sree 

Narayana Mission Home, and has since expanded 

to include Tampines North CCC, Kembangan-Chai 

Chee Social Team and Jurong Spring CCC. Project 

100=50 allows selected beneficiaries to purchase 

items at a 50% discount, up to a maximum discount 

of $50. These invited beneficiaries typically belong 

to lower middle-income families who require some 

form of financial help. The programme had helped 

these beneficiaries save money when buying 

groceries through discounted prices.

Sheng Siong had supported 45 such events 

throughout 2018 by setting up booths, providing 

shopping trolleys, baskets, fridges and shopping 

bags. Our colleagues from the Housebrand 

Department have also volunteered their services, 

contributing about 672 volunteer hours at these 

events. 



The Mother’s Day charity walk drew some 3,000 

participants.

LEADERSHIP COMMITMENTS

 TO SUSTAINABILITY

For more than 30 years, Sheng Siong has striven to 

excel in our mission of creating value sustainably 

for our customers, with a core focus on good 

service, quality products, and reasonable prices. To 

achieve this, sustainability is a theme that pervades 

our business operations and strategy formulations. 

Our sustainability journey is built on 5 key pillars.

Each pillar represents different sustainability 

issues that we hold close to our hearts and our 

commitments to change and/or influence positively 

in ways that remain relevant and accountable to 

our stakeholders.

CARE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

Singapore declared the year of 2018 as the Year 

of Climate Action. We believe that we have an 

important role to play when it comes to tackling 

climate change. In line with the Sustainable 

Singapore goals, we look at how we can conserve 

resources and reduce our carbon footprint.

Renewable Energy

In 2013, solar panels spanning an area of about 

11,000 square meters were installed on the rooftop 

of our Mandai Link Distribution Centre. When 

commissioned in 2014, it was the largest single 

photovoltaic system in Singapore, with a capacity 

of 1,200 kilowatts-peak.

In 2018, solar energy contributed about 12.6% 

of our energy requirements for the distribution 

centre. This is slightly lower than the 14% last year 

because some solar panels were removed during 

the works of building the warehouse extension. 

Our proactive effort to be environment-friendly 

was recognised when we were conferred the 

Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) 

Solar Pioneer Award in late 2013.

Conserving Resources

We adopt the 3Rs “reduce, reuse, recycle” principle 

in the management of our resources. We monitor 

and measure the usage of our resources and 

waste streams because we believe that through 

conserving precious resources, we not only 

contribute to a more sustainable environment but 

also reduce costs and create better value for our 

stakeholders.

Tackling an Array of Environmental Issues

From packaging waste to food waste, water 

conservation 

to 

energy 

conservation, 

and 

sustainable sourcing, these huge and complex 

issues that we have responsibilities towards 

cannot be solved on our own. The supermarkets 

often become the centre of attention because of 

the high visibility of our business. However, our 

good business sense tells us that any amount of 

waste reduced, any volume of water saved, and 

any amount of energy conserved, all translates to 

cost savings for our business and higher returns 

for our stakeholders. 

Everyone has a role to play in our fight against 

climate change. It is paramount that we as a nation 

build collective actions towards protecting the 

environment. While we take up the responsibility 

of supplying responsibly, we hope that everyone 

as a consumer could consider consuming more 

responsibly. 

We hope our Annual Report and Sustainability 

Report will, together, provide you with a more 

holistic perspective of our business. We value 

your feedback and look forward to making the 

organisation a more inclusive one with greater 

integration of the sustainable development issues 

that you are most concerned about.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

The Sheng Siong Board is the highest governance 

body consisting of the Executive Chairman, 

Executive Vice-Chairman, CEO, Managing Director, 

Executive Director, one Non-Executive Director, 

and four Independent Directors. Our Board of 

Directors has expertise in the fields of business 

management, finance, law, real estate, and food 

safety, and contributes positively to strategy 

formulation and risk mitigation.

Together, the Board and Management are 

responsible for overseeing the Group’s risk 

management 

framework 

and 

policies, 

and 

reviewing their effectiveness for all economic, 

environmental and social topics. While the 

Executive Management meets regularly, the Board 

reviews our Group’s sustainability issues at least 

once a year.

Since 2015, the Group has established an 

Organisational Excellence Committee1 at the 

management level to review and discuss topics of 

innovation and business excellence, including risk 

management. In 2018, the Group established a Risk 

and Business Continuity Committee, to dedicate 

better oversight on risk management and business 

continuity issues. Both committees report to the 

CEO.

The Sustainability Committee was set up in 2017 

to provide oversight on the Group’s material ESG 

topics. The committee is led by our Executive 

Director, Lin Ruiwen, and comprises members of 

the senior management of key business functions 

such as operations, human resource, quality 

assurance, finance, procurement, IT and corporate 

communications. The committee is responsible for 

formulating sustainability policies, championing 

sustainability 

projects, 

and 

monitoring 

their 

effectiveness and performance targets. 

Stakeholder consultation is used in the identification 

and 

management 

of 

sustainability 

material 

issues. Members play the role of champions of 

sustainability issues within the Group, and meet 

regularly to review, discuss and identify potential 

environmental, social and governance risks that 

Sheng Siong is susceptible to, as well as to monitor 

our progress and performance. The Executive 

Director then evaluates and provides advice 

and recommendations to the CEO and Board of 

Directors on the areas for improvements, and 

possible strategies and actions concerning these 

topics. The committee is also tasked to work with 

relevant departments in executing the approved 

strategies and actions.

1 The Organisational Excellence Committee is renamed to the Business Excellence Committee in 2018.

BUSINESS VALUES AND ETHICS

Our core values were developed over years of 

engaging with our key stakeholders in fulfilling our 

mission of serving the needs of our customers and 

creating value for them sustainably. The 8 core 

values guide our employees to be reasonable, 

harmonious, responsible, dedicated, earnest and 

efficient at work, with no empty promises and 

excuses. These are the cornerstones of how we 

conduct ourselves and foster valuable relationships 

with our stakeholders. We also observe a high 

level of business ethics by working closely with 

regulators to ensure we comply with the relevant 

regulations.

Sheng Siong strives to build trust, transparency, 

integrity and reliability in our relationships with our 

stakeholders. Our core values and employee’s code 

of conduct are communicated to our staff through 

our Employee Handbook which is written in both 

the English and Chinese language and during 

regular meetings with our staff and suppliers. 

These values and code of conduct are regularly 

reviewed by the management.

Our high regard for ethics is further displayed in 

our strong organisational culture and belief of 

unchanging moral principles - “With morality as 

our bedrock, we continue our legacy by setting self-

expectations to walk the talk and to be good examples 

for others. With this, we will conquer all odds and 

ensure the continuity of Sheng Siong”.

Once a year, key employees are required to declare 

any potential conflict of interests, and all employees 

are reminded of the Group’s anti-corruption policy 

on accepting gifts and favours. The Group’s conflict 

of interest policy and anti-corruption policy serve to 

guide our employees in their conduct of day-to-day 

business and in managing our trading relationships 

with suppliers. Our suppliers are also required to 

sign a Master Agreement which specifies the terms 

and conditions, and appropriate behaviour when 

trading with us.

Sheng Siong’s whistleblowing policy is championed 

by the Audit Committee at the board level. Our 

whistleblowing procedure enables employees or 

any other persons to raise concerns in confidence, 

without fear of reprisal in any form. The 

management places great importance to this so 

much so that the personal contact information of 

our senior management, including our CEO’s, can 

be found outside our store for ease of reach. 

Our employees can access these policies on Sheng 

Siong’s intranet as well.

Stakeholders 

Impact &amp; Significance

Customers

Our customers are the foundation of our business success. We strive to create 

value sustainably for our customers by providing a convenient and comfortable 

shopping environment with good service and quality products at reasonable 

prices. We want to be able to be stay relevant and responsive to their evolving 

needs.

Employees

Our employees’ performance is critical to the success of our business. They 

are part of our human capital and their health, safety and well-being, and 

competencies are fundamental to Sheng Siong’s operational effectiveness. We 

aim to develop their potential to drive innovation, productivity and organisational 

excellence through promoting close, transparent and direct communication 

between employees and higher-level management.

Suppliers

Sheng Siong works closely with partners in our value chain to ensure that food 

and products are in line with industry safety standards, to improve product range 

and food and service quality, and to reduce risks related to sustainability issues. 

Government 

Agencies

Besides regulatory compliance, we partner with key government agencies to 

jointly raise industry standards for food and product safety, food security and 

other sustainability practices, as well as workplace safety and health standards.

NGOs &amp; 

Voluntary Welfare

Organisations

Our business activities have economic, environmental, and social impacts on the 

communities where we operate. Therefore, it is critical that we give back to our 

community and work with industry associations, educational/research institutions 

as well as not-for-profit bodies to promote sustainability along the Group’s value 

chain. This may range from influencing shopper behaviour to raising industry 

standards.

Media

News and information outlets are one of the main sources of information for our 

stakeholders and the public. We aim to engage the media to understand societal 

expectations of the food retail value chain and to influence shopper behaviour 

positively.

Shareholders / 

Investors

Our investors play a vital role in the success and growth of our Group. The 

investment community is a feedback loop for the Group’s formulation of its 

growth strategies. We strive to maximise shareholder returns, observe good 

corporate governance and improve levels of transparency through the timely 

communication of our financial and sustainability reporting. 

Table 1: Impact &amp; Significance of Key Stakeholder Groups

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

The key stakeholders that we engage are the groups whom our business has a significant impact on, and 

those which have a high interest in or considerable influence on our business. 

As we adopt sustainability perspectives in our management systems and business strategies, we recognise 

that different stakeholders may have competing priorities. Through our tailored stakeholder engagement 

approach, we hope to understand their needs and expectations better as well as to communicate on how 

we are managing the topics of concern.

 

Through a stakeholder mapping exercise, we have identified the following seven key stakeholder groups.

OUR APPROACH

TO MATERIALITY

In September 2018, a stakeholder engagement survey including internal and external stakeholders was 

conducted to determine the priority of our material sustainability issues. Their views were incorporated 

into our materiality assessment, which has informed the development of this report. The Group uses the 

sustainability report as the primary channel for communicating our sustainability efforts to our stakeholders.

CoNTENT ToPIC BouNDARIES &amp; MATERIALITy ASSESSMENT

Materiality in relation to sustainability is an important principle as it helps us to identify and prioritise the 

economic, environmental and social topics that impact the success of the business and that matters most 

to our stakeholders. The outcomes of our materiality assessment will primarily be used to inform our 

sustainability strategy, management approach and report content.  

We periodically review our material issues against the changing business landscape, regulatory environment, 

emerging global and domestic trends, industry best practices, as well as stakeholder opinions to keep 

abreast on issues that matter to the business and its stakeholders and to stay relevant and responsive to 

their needs.

In 2018, Sheng Siong commissioned an independent consultant specialising in sustainability to conduct 

a materiality assessment, based on current and emerging trends, stakeholder perspectives and our list 

of previously identified material issues. A three-step approach (shown in figure 3) was adopted in the 

determination and prioritisation of our material sustainability issues.

ABOUT THIS

REPORT







A benchmarking exercise and desktop research were 

conducted to assess if there were any key or emerging 

issues not included from Sheng Siong’s original list of 

material issues. This was to ensure that Sheng Siong 

has a comprehensive picture of what issues might be 

material and to form the basis of the engagement stages. 

The list was then consolidated through the grouping of 

related issues. The outcome was a shortlist of 17 issues 

for prioritisation.

Using the findings gathered from Step 1, an online survey 

was distributed to both internal and external stakeholders 

(including customers) to gather perspectives on what 

the most important sustainability issues are for the 

business to prioritise. The survey uses both the Likert 

scale (rating from 1-5) and a ranking system, in addition 

to qualitative questions to gather feedback.  The surveys 

yielded more than 1500 responses from employees 

across the business and 179 responses from external 

stakeholders including suppliers, government agencies, 

NGOs, VWOs, media and shareholders. The results were 

weighted to ensure a balanced representation of the 

varying views and priorities of the different stakeholder 

groups.

An analysis was done to consolidate the results gathered 

to produce a preliminary list of material issues prioritised 

by internal and external perspectives, represented 

in the form of a materiality matrix. A working session 

was held with the Sustainability Committee to review, 

test and validate the final list of material issues and 

the materiality matrix. The prioritised set of material 

issues were presented to the Board for review for final 

endorsement.

The materiality matrix below (Figure 2) shows the output from  the materiality assessment. A 

comprehensive list of 17 material issues considered was plotted against the x-axis, which shows the 

importance of each issue on the business, and against the y-axis, which shows how important each 

issue is for Sheng Siong to manage according to external stakeholders.

We have continued to use the percentile methodology for the classification of priority to be consistent with 

our previous reporting approach. However, the categories have been renamed to Priority (75th percentile), 

Important (25th to 75th percentile), and Moderate (0 to 25th percentile) instead of ‘low’ to reflect the relative 

importance of the issues (with all issues scoring at least a 3 out of 5). 

The priority issues are those that internal and external stakeholders view as the highest importance for 

Sheng Siong to manage and report on. The issues ranked ‘Moderate’ are less critical and of lower relative 

importance to both internal and external stakeholders. However, we believe that they remain relevant and

should be actively managed and reported to an appropriate degree according to business priorities and 

stakeholder needs.

Table 3 details the list of materiality issues categorised according to their level of importance.

11. Employee 

Engagement 

and 

Development  

Our employees’ performance 

is critical for the success of our 

business. At Sheng Siong, we 

seek to attract and retain the 

best employees through the 

provision of equal opportunities 

for growth and development, as 

well as ensuring that they are 

recognised for their performance 

through a fair remuneration and 

reward system.   

• Care for our 

Employees

We continuously benchmark our remuneration 

and benefits package against the industry’s 

standards to ensure competitive remuneration.

We strive to maintain a fair remuneration system 

through timely performance appraisals and 

feedback for our team leaders. Our employees 

are appraised at least 1-2 times annually for 

recommendations for promotions.

Formal trainings are conducted on a needs 

basis, and on-the-job trainings are conducted 

extensively where immediate feedback can be 

provided by the leadership. We aim to set up 

a training centre by 2021 to formalise some 

of these trainings, and work is well underway 

where our first batch of potential in-house 

trainers have been identified for training and 

designing of our training curriculum.

Employees are key assets of 

Sheng Siong and it is therefore 

crucial for the company to 

enable safe behaviours and 

environments. This will also 

indirectly ensure that customers’ 

health and safety are protected 

when they shop in our stores.

• Care for our 

Employees

Our workplace safety and health (WSH) 

management system is developed based on 

the result of our risk assessment and covers 

all our employees, business activities, and 

locations of our business operations. The last 

risk assessment was conducted in 2017. 

Our Workplace Safety and Health committees 

meet 

regularly

14. Sustainable 

Supply Chain 

Management  

Building 

strong 

and 

lasting 

relationships with our suppliers 

is essential for the success of 

our business.

With the increasing challenges 

brought about by issues such 

as climate change, resource 

conservation 

and 

labour 

practices, Sheng Siong has a role 

to play in positively influencing 

how goods and services are 

produced and supplied, in order 

to build a sustainable future.

• Care for our 

Community

• Leadership Commitments to Sustainability

We actively engage with the government, NGOs, 

and VWOs to discuss about Sheng Siong’s role 

in sustainable sourcing. Our aim is to continue 

keeping our products and fresh food affordable 

while exploring ways we can move forward on 

our sustainable sourcing journey.

15. Contribution 

to the 

Community 

Sheng Siong serves consumers 

of the community where we 

operate. We believe that as 

part of the community, it is 

important that we lend our 

hands to those who are less 

fortunate, and champion causes 

that we believe are essential for 

sustainable development. 

It is also critical that our business 

activities are organised with 

care for the neighbourhood to 

mitigate disturbance, pollution, 

and 

promote 

safety 

and 

community spirit.

• Business Excellence

• Care for our 

Employees

• Care for our 

Community

Our sustainability report is used to report on 

our contributions towards community initiatives 

and philanthropic activities.

Our operations and service team regularly 

monitor feedback from consumers about 

possible disturbances, and to address the 

feedback immediately. As a consequence, we 

may receive warnings or fines from regulators if 

these issues are not resolved. 

Support community activities.

Charitable donations and 

sponsorships to the local 

community.

Continue to work with local town 

councils to reduce disruption to 

the minimum.







Support community activities 

and make charitable donations 

and sponsorships to the local

SHENG SIONG'S

APPROACH TO

SUPPORT THE SDGs

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), comprising 17 of the world’s most pressing challenges 

was endorsed by the UN in 2015 to achieve the underpinning 169 targets by 2030. As part of this year’s 

Sustainability Report, Sheng Siong would like to communicate our commitment towards supporting the 

SDGs. 

While Sheng Siong contributes to this holistic and interrelated global framework for sustainable development 

in several ways, through a review of each of the SDGs based on their opportunities and where our business 

can make the biggest impact, we have selected 4 goals to focus on. These 4 goals will be used to inform our 

sustainability strategy and relevant targets going forward and we will report on their progress accordingly.  

Sustainability is a journey, and we shall remain watchful on the opportunities to incorporate more SDGs as 

part of our growth strategy.

Partnerships for Smart Business

Flawless Perfection - an inconceivable ideal of a summit that may never 

be surmounted, but which we nevertheless relentlessly pursue. Each 

milestone crossed emboldens our next stride with earnest zeal, and 

even missteps can glean guideposts that steer us closer towards the 

best that we can be.

A FORERUNNER FOR NEW PROCESSES AND 

TECHNOLOGY

Sheng Siong strives to be a forerunner in adopting 

new processes and technologies that improve 

operational efficiencies and productivity, simplify 

workflow and enhance our customers’ experience 

to achieve outstanding performance. This earned 

us the SPRING Innovation Excellence Award in 

2015.

We continue to work closely with key partners 

such as Enterprise Singapore in developing and 

adopting new processes and technology to improve 

our business capabilities. This is an important 

foundation for us in our plan to expand into the 

international market. 

Gaining on the momentum towards building a 

Smart Nation, we have adopted the following new 

technologies and made improvements to existing 

ones. 

Enhancements to the Suppliers’ Portal

We continue to enhance our suppliers’ portal to 

include new features to facilitate communication 

with our suppliers and simplify administrative 

procedures. This allows our clerical staff to be 

freed up to take on job roles that enlarge the scope 

of their responsibilities and skill sets.

Integration of Business Processes under the 

Sheng Siong (SS) Enterprise App

We have started to integrate some of our business 

processes under the SS Enterprise App which is 

a mobile application that facilitates operational 

business functions such as purchase order (PO) 

approvals, real-time inventory inquiry and sales 

monitoring, all conducted through the mobile 

phone. We intend to include more functions in the 

near future like human resource management, 

inventory management, logistics management 

and even supplier management within the app. 

We think that work will be less desk-bound in 

the future, and with this new found “freedom” in 

mobility, we can only imagine the lasting impact on 

productivity and efficiency.

Improving Product Traceability

In 2018, we conducted a pilot-test on a project to 

improve product traceability by capturing product 

expiry information during goods receiving. We 

believe that this would not only improve our 

inventory management but would also facilitate 

stock verification during the storefront, saving 

significant time and human resources. Although 

the results of the pilot were unsatisfactory, we will 

go  back to the drawing block and review the gaps 

identified, and at the same time continue to explore 

new technologies that could help us advance on 

this front.





“At the old warehouse, I was a labourer doing manual 

picking, receiving and stacking of goods. When 

the distribution centre shifted to Mandai in 2011, I 

was fortunate to be involved in a series of system 

improvements. There were the implementations of 

auto-replenishment, 

pick-to-light 

and 

put-to-light 

systems. These automation processes have simplified 

our workflow and maximized productivity by using the 

least labour. The most unexpected takeaway is that, my 

job scope has been redesigned from that of a manual 

worker to that of a warehouse manager today.”



Mr Foo Jia Hui, 36

Warehouse Manager

Improve Goods Receiving and Distribution of 

Fresh Food

The goods receiving and distribution process 

of fresh produce such as seafood and meat by 

weight has been time-consuming and prone to 

errors. The PC-based weighing scale programmed 

to integrate with our inventory management and 

distribution systems shortened suppliers’ waiting 

time at delivery, and made our distribution of fresh 

produce more efficient and accurate. Without a 

doubt, this also allows us to offer fresher produce 

to our customers! This new project has been 

successfully rolled out at our distribution centre 

and we are expecting to implement it at our 

purchase station in the Jurong Fishery Port (JFP) by 

2019.

Connecting with our Customers through Sheng 

Siong (SS) Connect

As society becomes more digitally connected, it is 

paramount that Sheng Siong also explores ways 

to better connect, communicate and engage with 

our customers. We created the SS Connect App 

with this vision in mind. At its pilot stage, we have 

included features such as in-store promotion alerts, 

auto-completion of Sheng Siong’s mega promotion 

lucky draw entry form, e-receipts, purchase history 

records and store locator. We envision SS Connect 

to play the role of a shopping assistant to our 

customers and see ourselves adding more exciting 

functions and features in the near future.

Managing Risk of Petty Theft

Although the ShopWatch Community Safety 

and Security Programme (CSSP) that we have 

collaborated with the Singapore Police Force and 

implemented back in 2015 has come to an end, we 

have continued to champion the cause to this date. 

To deter shop theft, Sheng Siong supermarket 

employees double up as security officers and wear 

vests bearing the words “SHOPWATCH”. At the 

same time, they assist our customers with their 

shopping needs, thus promoting quality customer 

service. We channelled the financial savings from 

hiring fewer security officers to our employees and 

customers as awards for identifying potential petty 

thefts. Since our official implementation in 2015, 

the rates of petty theft committed at our stores 

have been moderate, registering at 248 cases in 

2018 versus 250 cases in 2017, despite the opening 

of 10 more new stores last year.

and value in enhancing authentic training for 

students who will form the future workforce in 

the retail business industry. We signed an MOU 

with ITE to formalise a partnership in student and 

staff development through collaborations in areas 

such as internship opportunities, Scholarships and 

Course Medal Awards for ITE students, attachments 

for ITE staff and industry projects related to Sheng 

Siong’s business and operations. We believe that 

our partnership will bring about opportunities for 

learning and innovation for both organisations.

regular monitoring and establishing safeguards 

within our systems to prevent breaches, we have 

also established a business continuity plan which 

focuses on the recovery of technology facilities and 

platforms, such as critical applications, databases, 

servers or other required technology infrastructure 

for the viability of the business.

COMMUNICATION AND TRAINING ON ANTI-

CORRUPTION AND ANTI-COMPETITION

Our policy on anti-corruption is disseminated to 

all our employees. We have a set of guidelines 

specifying the responsibilities of each employee 

in observing and upholding Sheng Siong’s zero-

tolerance stance towards all forms of corruption 

and collusion. It also provides information and 

guidance to employees on how to recognise, 

address and prevent instances of corruption and 

collusion which may arise in the course of their 

work.

Key personnel identified as holding sensitive 

positions are also required to declare any conflict of 

interests and sign an agreement with the company. 











Sheng Siong employees at two outreach talks conducted by 

the CCCS (top) and the CPIB (bottom).

In 2018, a total of sixty-three employees of key 

positions signed the conflict of interest agreement. 

In 2018, there were zero incidents of corruption 

and zero cases of legal actions for anti-competitive 

behaviour.

Fifty-eight employees attended an outreach talk 

conducted by the Corrupt Practices Investigation 

Bureau (CPIB) on the Anti-Corruption law in 

Singapore, of which forty-three were senior and 

middle management staff.

Forty employees attended an outreach talk 

conducted by the Competition &amp; Consumer 

Commission Singapore (CCCS) on the Anti-

Competition Law and Consumer Protection Fair 

Trading Act in Singapore, of which twenty-seven 

were senior and middle management staff.

We recognise the importance of conducting an 

ethical and fair business with our suppliers and 

strive to improve transparency in our business 

dealings.

“The outreach talks have been very 

relevant to my work. The sharing from 

the 

Corrupt 

Practices 

Investigation 

Bureau (CPIB) has emphasised on the 

consequences of corruption, such as how 

corruption creates unfair competition 

and 

increases 

business 

costs. 

As 

negotiation is a daily affair for a buyer, I 

have gleaned adequate negotiation skills 

from the anti-competition talk and what 

constitutes an abuse of dominance.”

Care for our Customers

A Responsible Retailer

We’ve served you for over 30 years, and yet each meeting between familiar 

faces never ceases to enkindle a radiant warmth that brings inspiration and 

renewal to our commitment to you.

CARE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS 

A RESPONSIBLE RETAILER

GATEKEEPER oF CoNSuMER HEALTH &amp; 

SAFETY

As Singapore’s 3rd largest supermarket operator, 

we recognise our responsibility as the final 

gatekeeper in the supply chain to safeguard the 

health, safety and interests of our customers. 

Our promise to our customers is based on three 

core pillars: Quality, Service and Price. We take 

responsibility in providing accurate and sufficient 

product and marketing information for shoppers 

to make informed choices. We also protect the 

privacy of personal information that customers 

entrust to us.

In the supermarket retail business, the supply 

chain is a long and complex one. We work with 

over 1,000 local and international suppliers ranging 

from farmers, manufacturers, local distributors, 

concessionaires to importers and exporters. They 

supply to us a wide range and variety of groceries, 

household products and fresh produce.

As we work with various types of suppliers, the 

boundaries for some of these material topics may 

be beyond our reasonable purview. However, 

we seek to improve our selection procedures of 

our suppliers and products continuously and to 

monitor our suppliers’ standards of operations. 

We recognise our ability to influence the supply 

chain, and shall within reasonable means, strive to 

influence positively continually.

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

Sheng Siong’s tagline “All for you” reflects our 

organisation’s focus on customer care and service. 

It is one of the Group’s key objectives to improve 

consumer experience at all our retail outlets 

constantly. Sheng Siong’s score on the Customer 

Satisfaction Index of Singapore (CSISG) has 

improved consistently over the last few years to 

72.4 in 2017 and 73.1 in 2018, making the largest 

improvements among supermarket operators. 

326 employees were rewarded for good service 

rendered to our customers in 2018 as compared 

to 284 employees in 2017.

To fulfil the evolving needs of our consumers, 

we operate 39 stores (out of 54 as at end 2018) 

24-hours. During the 2018 Chinese New Year, 

19 of our stores remained open during the two 

public holidays. Besides, we continue to offer 

our e-commerce “allforyou.sg” online grocery 

shopping service to customers who prefer the 

alternative shopping platform. We will continue to 

explore various technologies in improving picking 

efficiencies and last-mile delivery.

Last year also saw us re-launching the Sheng Siong 

Facebook page, which allows us to communicate 

and engage with our customers better, and 

provides customers with more accessibility for after 

sales care. However, the improved accessibility 

also meant we received more feedback in 2018, 

bringing our complaint to compliment ratio to 1.3.

We continue to collaborate closely with government 

agencies such as the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) 

and SingStat to monitor excessive price increases 

in daily necessities to address profiteering and anti-

competitive practices in Singapore. Diversification 

is also practised in our sourcing and procurement 

strategy to ensure a sustainable supply of food and 

products at a stable and affordable price. Regular 

market research and benchmarking are conducted 

to ensure that Sheng Siong provides the best value 

in a basket of essential goods.

Our market share of Singapore’s grocery shopping 

industry has grown from about 14% in 2017 to 

about 15% in 2018 and is a good proxy indicator 

for our success in improving customer satisfaction 

notwithstanding the increase in store count.

Besides, we also implemented the following 

initiatives to enhance customer satisfaction in 

2018:

• Extension of 3% Special Discount for Senior 

Citizens every Wednesday.

• Extension of Hybrid Self-Checkout systems that 

shorten customers’ queue time.

• Continue to reward our lucky customers for their 

loyalty through the Sheng Siong Mega Promotion 

Campaign (The Sheng Siong Show).

• Pilot test the NETs QR Code as an alternative 

cashless payment method.

HEALTHIER DIET CHOICES, HEALTHIER 

SINGAPORE

We care about our impact on consumer health. 

That is why we aim to improve the health and 

nutritional standards of processed food products 

under our housebrands continuously. This is in 

line with the Nation’s movement towards leading a 

healthier lifestyle, which saw the Health Promotion 

Board introduce the Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS) 

programme for packaged food products to help 

consumers make healthier choices in their grocery 

shopping.

In 2018, two products - Happy Family Kopi-O 

Kosong and Happy Family Kopi–O were reviewed 

for possible nutritional improvements and were 

successfully reformulated to replace margarine 

with corn oil when roasting the coffee beans. The 

two products now meet the nutritional standards 

set by HPB and carry the HCS logo.

For new products, we have set our mind to develop 

them in consideration of meeting the nutritional 

standards of the HCS. For example, we launched 

Happy Family Instant Paste in 2018, a series 

of instant paste (e.g. Chicken Curry, Rendang, 

Assam Fish, Tom Yum) which is not only quick 

and convenient to cook, but also uses healthier 

ingredients by lowering the percentage of sugar 

and sodium in the products. In September 2018, 

we launched two new olive oil products – classic 

and extra virgin under our housebrand “Heritage 

Farm”. Again, these products were specially 

formulated to meet the nutritional standards of 

the HCS programme. 

Taking stock, we now have sixty-five housebrand 

products carrying the HCS logo, a stark increase 

from twenty-five last year, and 186 housebrand 

products that are trans fat free. These include 

canned seafood, canned vegetables, canned fruit, 

rice, confectionaries, cooking oil, titbits, instant 

beverages, canned tuna and condiments. We will 

continue relentlessly to work with our suppliers to 

expand the range and selection of healthier choice 

products.

Since 2017, we partnered the Health Promotion 

Board in the “Eat, Drink, Shop Healthy Challenge” 

to encourage consumers to make healthier choices 

during their daily grocery shopping. For every HCS 

product purchased, customers can scan the QR 

code generated on their receipts to be awarded 

Healthpoints. These Healthpoints can be used to 

redeem grocery shopping vouchers.

FRESH AND SAFE

Maintenance of the cold chain is important for 

preserving the safety, freshness, shelf life and 

quality (including nutritional value and sensory 

characteristics) of fresh produce while reducing 

wastage arising from spoilage throughout the 

supply chain. We  adopted Cold Chain Management 

in the storage and handling of our fresh produce in 

2011. This covers major supply chain links including 

transportation, distribution as well as storage at 

our logistics centre and retail outlets. 

As part of our Quality Assurance Programme, we 

have a self-test programme to check and review 

products that are prone to food safety issues. We 

send samples of products and fresh produce from 

our logistics centre regularly to an external lab for 

tests on microbial, chemical and pesticide residue 

levels.

To promote food safety among our customers, we 

collaborated with AVA in organising a series of food 

safety campaigns comprising of roadshows at our 

stores during the Food Safety month in July.





We worked together with AVA to raise food safety 

awareness amongst our customers.

CERTIFICATIONS

• HACCP certified since 2013

• ISO 22000:2005 Food Safety Management System 

certified since 2016.

NON-COMPLIANCE

In 2018, we had seven incidents relating to food 

safety, of which six were raised by the authorities, 

and one was raised internally. Whenever such 

incidents arise, our suppliers are immediately 

informed, and the products recalled and disposed 

of. We received two warnings and four non-

significant monetary fines*. We have since taken 

actions to prevent such lapses.

We received two warnings for non-compliance 

concerning product and service information and 

labelling. There has been no case of non-compliance 

concerning marketing communications that have 

resulted in a fine or penalty or warning.

*Significant monetary fines are defined as being 

greater than $1,000 per incident.

WE RESPECT CUSTOMER PRIVACY

Every year, there are two seasons of our weekly 

“Sheng 

Siong 

Show” 

where 

customers 

can 

participate for prizes by submitting their receipts 

at our retail outlets. To protect our customers’ 

right to the privacy of their personal data, receipts 

which contain customers’ personal particulars are 

shredded fortnightly. 

Sheng Siong complies with the Personal Data 

Protection Act (PDPA) which governs the collection, 

use and disclosure of personal data that took effect 

since 2014.  Our IT policy comprises of regular risk 

assessment that allows us to monitor and establish 

safeguards within our systems to prevent breaches. 

There were zero substantiated complaints received 

concerning breaches of customer privacy or loss of 

customers’ data.

EMPLOYEE RIGHTS

Sheng Siong complies with Singapore’s Employment Act for the minimum notice period of termination to 

affected employees. At least two weeks’ notice period or two weeks’ salary in lieu of notice is given to an 

affected employee of a non-managerial role who has served for a minimum of two years.

At least one month’s notice period or one month’s salary in lieu of notice is given to an affected employee 

of a managerial position.

Other changes to employment arrangements such as change of work shifts and location of work are

profit-sharing scheme to reward our employees’ good performance. 

We also reward our employees based on the following merits:

• Long service

• Innovation

• Making recommendations for new products

• Excellent service

• Reporting theft - Everyone is an effective “security officer.”

WE BELIEVE IN STAFF TRAINING

At Sheng Siong, new employees are welcomed into the company through a one-day orientation programme. 

We place a strong emphasis on on-the-job training as it assimilates a new employee into his or her job’s role 

and responsibilities more quickly.

The service training programme conducted in collaboration with the Singapore Institute of Retail Studies 

(SIRs) ended in 2017. The rapid expansion of the Group coupled with the tightening of foreign labour policy 

has resulted in a manpower strain allowing little resources for formal training. However, Sheng Siong 

remains committed to the training and skills upgrading of our staff. There is a strong emphasis for on-

the-job training due to the nature of our business, and we believe this shall remain the foundation of our 

training method as learning through role modelling and from experience is fundamental to our operational 

effectiveness. 

We will continue to set up a more structured approach to our training and explore the adoption of on-the-

go e-learning as a training platform that can be more accessible and receptive among our employees.  We 

are building a training supermarket within the new extension of our HQ cum distribution centre by 2021.

WORKPLACE SAFETY AND HEALTH 

Our Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) management system is developed based on the result of our risk 

assessment and covers all our employees, business activities and locations of our business operations. 

The last risk assessment was conducted in 2017. Our WSH policies comply with the Singapore Workplace 

Safety and Health Act. As part of compliance, the Group is required to set up a Workplace Safety and Health 

Committee. We also abide by the Fire Safety Act and have developed an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) 

and established a Company Emergency Response Team (CERT).

The committee will

• 

Meet monthly to discuss matters related to WSH and Fire Safety.

• 

Conduct monthly workplace inspections and provide reports documenting the observations and 

recommendations on remedial actions required.

• 

Investigate and report on accidents and recommend actions to be taken.

• 

Promote WSH among colleagues.

• 

Collect feedback on WSH related issues from employees.

• 

Conduct regular WSH related training and staff briefings.

100% of our workforce is represented by the two joint management-worker Workplace, Safety and 

Health Committees – one for our warehousing and distribution centre, and the other for our stores.  The 

committee reports to the Risk Management and Business Continuity Committee that is chaired by the 

Executive Director.

We have been working with a professional WSH consultant since 2015 to advise us on our Group’s WSH 

related issues. Regular review meetings are also conducted with our insurance brokerage firm which also

provides advice on risk management. 

The most common causes of our workplace injuries include:

• 

Cut or laceration

• 

Slipped, tripped, fell

• 

Hit by objects

• 

Over-exertions

Our employees are encouraged to report on potential WSH hazards and may report these anonymously 

through our feedback box. Our whistleblowing procedure allows our employees to raise their concerns in 

confidence and remain protected against reprisals.

Our sub-contractors make up less than 0.5% of our workforce and are required to comply with our WSH 

policies. Their management is given direct access to provide feedback to our Group’s management.

Sheng Siong has not gone on to manage our suppliers’ responsibilities towards their employees’ safety and 

health. This information is currently unavailable. We shall continue to explore how the Group can play a 

positive role in fostering workplace safety and health along the supply chain.

WoRKPLACE SAFETy TRAINING &amp; EDuCATIoN

Annually we conduct two refresher trainings on the use of forklifts and electronic power jacks at our 

distribution centre. In 2018, we provided more training in the area of:

• 

First Aid

• 

Fire Safety

• 

Emergency Response

A group sharing channel is also established to send regular safety reminders, to promote learning from 

accidents that have occurred within the Group, and sharing of best safety practices.

PROVIDING MORE HEALTHCARE BENEFITS

We partner government agencies and NGOs to promote workplace health and safety. From 2014 to 2018, 

we partnered the Singapore Health Promotion Board (HPB) to roll out impactful targeted interventions 

for the retail workers at our outlets. In 2018, the focus was changed to the back-of-house supporting 

employees. The workplace health promotion programme consisted of health screening, health and 

ergonomic coaching and enhancement of our company’s meals by adopting less oil, less salt and less sugar 

in our food preparation. 

In 2018, we also participated in the National Steps Challenge™ organised by the HPB in a bid to encourage 

our employees to lead a healthier lifestyle by being more physically active.

We offer medical benefits by reimbursing our employees their medical consultation fees charged by 

government polyclinics or hospitals. Employees who face financial difficulties and challenging medical 

conditions may also apply to the Company for financial assistance.

Our founders also generously distribute healthcare equipment such as electronic toothbrushes and 

massage pads to our employees to promote preventive care and healthy living.

CARE FOR EMPLOYEES

To ease the rising cost of living and encourage our employees to eat better and healthier, we introduced in 

2017 a staff purchase scheme for groceries and fresh produce at our stores. Last year, the scheme paid out 

more than $310,000 in benefits, an increase of 43.6% as compared to 2017.

Other employee benefits that promote work-life balance and a pro-family culture include:

• 

Annual family day

• 

Family care leave

• 

Marriage leave and a congratulatory gift are given to eligible staff to prepare for their wedding or 

honeymoon.

• 

A newborn care package is presented to female employees and the wives of our male employees who 

have given birth.

• 

Bereavement contributions to employees for the loss of their loved ones.

• 

Flexi-work arrangements were introduced back in 2015. Our employees are allowed to take half-day 

leave. We also provide them with flexibility in work-time arrangements as required.

A record-breaking number of 15 employees received their long service award for 20 years of service to the 

Group. 

 

NON-COMPLIANCE

In 2018, the Group was fined for a sum of S$2,000.00 for failure to comply with Section 4(2) of the Workplace 

Safety and Health Act (Risk Management) where the existing risk control measures on the process for 

safe operation of the electric pallet jack were not effectively implemented and resulted in an accident that 

injured a worker. Gaps were immediately identified in our risk management of the use of this piece of 

equipment and appointed employees who operate the electric pallet jack were briefed again on the safety 

procedures. The incident was also shared during staff briefings with the greater group of employees, and 

everyone was strongly reminded to follow established safety procedures.



“I have joined Sheng Siong 20 years ago 

as a cashier and worked my way up to 

a supervisor. There are many benefits 

that the company provides, which are 

not available elsewhere. I have been 

given a necklace and 2 gold medallions 

during my 5th, 10th and 15th year of 

service. Last year, I received a Rolex 

as part of my Long Service Award (20 

years). My bosses are very supportive 

of older employees like us. So long as 

I am able, I will continue to work and 

contribute to the society.”

一只蜂酿不成蜜

Honey cannot be made from a single bee

Nor porridge, from a single grain

- Chinese Proverb

Through a collaborative joint effort, we can realise something more 

worthwhile. Having benefitted greatly from the Singapore customer base 

and community, we also strive to play to our strengths as a major retailer 

and do what we can to reciprocate and enrich the lives around us.

GIVING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY

Sheng Siong has a significant market presence in 

Singapore, where 99% of our managerial staff are 

Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents. It is our 

policy to give back to the local community where 

we operate, through supporting our employees 

and their family, community initiatives organised 

by NGOs and educational institutions and our 

suppliers.

The Group made charitable contributions of 

$49,844 to community initiatives in 2018. This may 

not seem like a significant amount, but we believe 

that charitable contributions should go beyond the 

monetary form. Therefore, when it comes to giving 

back to the community, Sheng Siong’s focus has 

consistently been a contribution of resources such 

as space, time, effort and labour. 

The supermarket is a space where the community 

congregates and we believe that we have an 

important role to play in promoting the community 

spirit, racial harmony and neighbourliness, as well 

as supporting conversations on what matters to 

our community and environment.

In addition to the examples raised in the Joint 

Message from the Chairman and the CEO, we also 

supported the following initiatives in 2018:

• 

SGX Bull Run

• 

Food waste reduction campaigns

• 

SEC #onelessplastic campaign

• 

SEC World ECO-label Day

• 

AVA Food Safety Month campaign

• 

Switch&amp;Save – Use LED (SSUL) Campaign

Our approach to community contribution and 

philanthropic activities are in line with our core 

mission of value creation for our stakeholders.

HELPING WITH RISING COST OF LIVING

While Sheng Siong strives to keep essential 

products affordable, we also believe in extending 

our helping hand to special groups of people within 

our community. In 2018, we extended our special 

3% senior citizen discount programme for another 

year, which cost the Group about S$1 million. 

We also work closely with community centres to 

organise trips for senior citizens to watch the live 

telecast of the Sheng Siong Show at MediaCorp 

which could be a privilege for some. 

EDUCATION GRANTS FOR LOWER-SALARIED

EMPLOYEES’ CHILDREN

Our lower-salaried staff receive an education grant 

for their children. The Annual Education Grant is 

fully paid for by the three founders of the Group, 

who are also major shareholders. 

Last year, we showed our care for our employees 

by disbursing annual education grants amounting 

to $506,800. The beneficiaries were 577 children of 

our lower-salaried employees.

A total of $2.9 million has been disbursed since the 

inception of the Grant in 2013. The three founders 

are committed to supporting the philanthropic 

activities of the Group and have contributed 

to causes such as the President’s Challenge 

2018, Singapore Road Safety Council, Chinese 

Development Assistance Council and Zhong Hua 

Cultural Society Singapore.

Since 2014, we have collaborated with the 

Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of 

Singapore (MINDs) through their enclave work 

model. We host 10 MINDs beneficiaries to work 

at our vegetable packing department. They work 

alongside our staff, dine with us for lunch at our 

canteen, and are invited to our company’s annual 

family day event to socialise with our employees.

A MORE VIBRANT SINGAPORE

Singapore imports more than 90% of our food 

sources. To remain competitive and create more 

value for our shoppers, our Group has adopted a 

direct sourcing strategy over the years, especially 

for our fresh food category. This has not only 

shortened the supply chain and improved savings 

but also helped us to have better oversight on food 

quality, food safety and food security issues. Sheng 

Siong also practises diversification in sourcing to 

keep supplies of our products stable and affordable 

throughout the year and in times of crisis.

We work with more than 1150 suppliers in our 

supply chain, where 80% of them are locally 

registered companies and represent about 92% 

of our total purchases. We support our locally 

registered suppliers by improving communications 

and business administration procedures through 

our suppliers’ portal and bulk handling of their 

products. 

SUPPORTING LOCAL FARMS

In the recent 2019 Budget announcement, 

Singapore targets to produce 30 per cent of 

Singapore's nutritional needs locally by 2030 in a 

bid to strengthen food security amidst increasing 

threats from climate change. Here are two 

examples of local farms whom we support among 

others:

Quan Fa Organic Farm (全发有机农业) is an organic 

farm located in Lim Chu Kang near Singapore’s 

western water catchment area. By carrying Quan 

Fa’s organic farm produce at our selected retail 

outlets, we join the government’s efforts to make 

Singapore a more vibrant society. We hope that 

the presence of organic produce at Sheng Siong’s 

mass market distribution channels will encourage 

venture capital interest for the support of farms in 

Singapore’s rural areas.

Yili Vegetation &amp; Trading Pte Ltd is a local farm for 

leafy vegetables producing some of Singaporean’s 

favourite vegetables like Xiao Bai Cai, Kang Kong, 

and Cai Xin. By carrying Yili’s vegetables in our 

stores, we hope to help them to build a value 

brand of safe, quality, and affordable locally 

produced vegetables and improve demand among 

our customers. 





“My elder daughter is pursuing her 

tertiary education while my younger 

daughter will be enrolling in university 

this year. I have been working in Sheng 

Siong as a storekeeper for 11 years, 

bringing up my two children single-

handedly as my husband had passed 

away more than 10 years ago. It has 

not been easy but the education grant 

and childcare allowance have come 

timely in lessening my burden.  For the 

past few years, the kids had used the 

education grant to pay for their school 

fees and books.”

SUPPORTING A LOCAL EGG FARM

N&amp;N Agriculture is a egg producer which operates its own egg laying farm 

in Singapore. For over a decade, Sheng Siong has been stocking up fresh 

eggs from this homegrown producer. Today, all our stores carry local eggs 

packed by N&amp;N.  

Since 2017, Sheng Siong has also worked with N&amp;N to produce our 

housebrand “Heritage Farm Fresh Eggs (10s)”. Besides playing our part to 

support local produce, we are also mindful of reducing our carbon footprint 

by distributing the eggs through our central distribution centre to all our 

stores.    

Mr Ma Chin Chew

CEO, N&amp;N Agriculture

“Sheng Siong has taken the lead in 

supporting local eggs, creating the sales 

channel for our eggs to be sold in Singapore 

across its retail network. As the market is 

very competitive, we appreciate having 

this platform to retail our eggs to local 

consumers.

By arranging for our eggs to be delivered 

to its distribution centre, Sheng Siong has 

provided a one-stop service, saving us the 

effort of delivering to all its stores, which 

in turn creates manpower savings and 

efficiency for us.”

customers’ needs, and while we strive to source 

more sustainably, it is our goal to continue to

92%1 of our housebrand paper products are 

certified under the Forest Stewardship Council 

(FSC). We have also increased our selection of 

sustainable seafood which now includes the 

Norwegian salmon, Norwegian mackerel, live 

Boston lobsters and live oysters.

SAFE NEIGHBOURHOODS

In 2017, we partnered with the Singapore Police 

Force to roll out the ShopWatch Community Safety 

and Security Programme (CSSP) at all our stores, 

after successful implementation at two-thirds of 

our stores in 2015. Sheng Siong has continued to 

champion the cause to this date. To deter shop 

theft, Sheng Siong supermarket employees wear 

vests bearing the words “SHOPWATCH. May I help 

you?” that signals our employees are present to 

deter theft. On the other hand, it is also a non-

intrusive way of offering assistance for shopping 

needs, thus promoting quality customer service.

We recorded 248 cases of customer thefts in 2018 

versus 250 cases in 2017 despite the addition of 10 

new stores.

QUIET NEIGHBOURHOODS

To play our part in promoting the quality of life in 

the heartlands, we worked with town councils to 

restrict delivery times by food suppliers to mitigate 

noise disturbance in the HDB neighbourhoods. 

Special delivery arrangements are made to ensure 

deliveries to the stores are at appropriate timings, 

and extreme care is taken during loading and 

unloading with noise reducing equipment such 

as noise absorbing pallet jacks to mitigate the 

disturbance. 

In 2018, we improved our categorisation of 

feedback and started to monitor the types of 

feedback collected - a total of 12 instances of 

feedback was received on noise disturbances.

CLEAN NEIGHBOURHOODS

We play our part in contributing to the cleanliness 

of the community we operate in. Pest control 

programmes are in place to alleviate the risk of 

pest infestations.

1 The disclosure in 2017 should have been reported as 90% instead of 96% due to an error made in classification of the 

products.





CARE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

Conserving Resources

The pressing call for greater attention to environmental issues rings loud 

and clear. We take initiatives to review and moderate our environmental 

impact, and to help foster an environmentally-conscious mindset 

amongst society at large. With only one Earth between us, it’s up to us to 

play our part for a sustainable living space.

In 2016, Singapore joined 170 other countries 

in signing the Paris Agreement. The Sustainable 

Singapore Blueprint was then developed to guide 

our nation towards the goal of building a more 

liveable and sustainable Singapore. 2018 was 

declared as the Year of Climate Action. Sheng Siong 

recognises its responsibility to contribute towards 

this goal. 

Sheng Siong has viewed the conservation of 

resources as a key business objective. We adopt 

the 3Rs “reduce, reuse, recycle” principle in the 

management of our resources and waste. We 

monitor and measure the usage of our resources 

and waste streams because we believe that 

through conserving precious resources, we not 

only contribute to a more sustainable environment 

but also lower cost and create value for our 

stakeholders.

REDUCE

Reduction of Carbon Footprint

To reduce our carbon footprint and our electricity 

consumption from the grid, a major photovoltaic 

system was installed in 2013 on the rooftop of our 

Mandai Link Distribution Centre. The panels occupy 

an area of about 11,000 square metres, making full 

use of its available roof area. Upon commissioning 

in 2014, the installation was the largest single 

photovoltaic system in Singapore with a capacity of 

1,200 kWp (kilowatt-peak). Our proactive effort to 

be environmental friendly was recognised and led 

the Group to become a recipient of the Singapore 

Economic Development Board (EDB) Solar Pioneer 

Award. In 2018, our PV (Solar) system supplied 

about 12.6% of our total energy usage at our 

distribution centre.

Our distribution centre has been awarded the 

BCA Green Mark Compliance for 100% use of LED 

lights, a cold storage heat recovery system, and its 

rainwater recovery system. Recovered rainwater is 

used for toilets, general washing and gardening on 

its premises.

The completion of our distribution centre in 2011 

enabled us to improve our capacity and ability in 

the bulk handling of products for our suppliers. 

By switching from a direct store delivery model to 

a centralised distribution model, we successfully 

reduced the number of trips our suppliers have to 

make to deliver to our stores -from 50-60 deliveries 

per day per store in the past to 5-6 deliveries per 

day directly from our distribution centre today, and 

hence the overall carbon footprint. Our warehouse 

is equipped with efficient inventory and distribution 

management systems that allow us to exercise 

better control over our logistics operations. 

Sheng Siong owns a fleet of 70 delivery vehicles. 

Since 1 January 2018, the National Environment 

Agency of Singapore (NEA) requires all new diesel 

vehicles to meet the Euro VI emission standard. 

Our fleet replacement policy is to choose vehicles 

that come with engineering solutions that adhere 

to the latest emission standards.

All our 54 stores have been fitted with LED lights. 

LED bulbs are the most efficient lighting choice, 

using only a third of the energy of fluorescent 

lights and potentially reducing our lights’ energy 

consumption by up to 80%.

Driving Behavioural Change

In 2018, with the support of the Building and 

Construction Authority (BCA) and Singapore Green 

Building Council (SGBC), we conducted a first-of-its-

kind Behavioural Change Pilot Programme to drive 

energy consumption changes among our staff and 

customers.

The bottom-up approach saw us getting our 

operational team to contribute ideas in reducing 

energy consumption within their outlet. The ideas 

and feedback were used to develop a behavioural 

change campaign plan, tailored for specific Sheng 

Siong outlets, to tackle these actions.

Key Actions Taken During the Campaign:

• 

Pulling down fridge blinds 15 minutes earlier 

before store closing

• 

Setting at higher temperature set-point for the 

air-conditioning system

• 

Improving distribution of cooled air by 

removing the clutter near air-con diffusers

• 

Turning off appliances (e.g. cashiers and 

payment counters) 15 minutes earlier before 

store closing

• 

Engaging customers on green messages 

through Facebook posts and in-store posters 

and mini-games

Through the campaign held from June to July, 

close to thirty employees played their part which 

led to an average of 12% reduction in the monthly 

electricity consumption. At the same time, five 

employees were also trained up in behavioural 

change knowledge and techniques. 

Learning from the pilot, we have identified gaps 

and also opportunities for improvements. In 2019, 

we will continue to work with BCA and SGBC to 

extend the pilot test to more stores.

Managing Food Waste

In 2017, close to 810 million kilograms of food was 

wasted in Singapore. This is a big problem for land-

scarce Singapore because we will soon run out of 

space for landfills. Besides, when we waste food, 

it is not just the food that is thrown out, but also 

the resources and effort devoted to nurturing, 

delivering and marketing it.

At Sheng Siong, we are extremely concerned 

about the need to reduce and manage food waste 

and believe that we need to do it right from the 

start. We have put in place sound purchasing and 

inventory management policies, excellent storage 

and food handling standards and systems, and 

adopted state-of-the-art packaging and processing 

techniques in prolonging the shelf life of our 

products and produce.

We have participated in Food Waste Reduction 

Campaigns headed by the NEA, putting up posters 

and signage in our stores to raise awareness and 

educate consumers to handle our fresh produce 

with care. Earlier in 2018, we also worked with a 

group of NTU students in the ‘Unfiltered Food’ 

Campaign which aims at correcting misperceptions 

about “ugly food” and educates consumers on 

ways of reducing food waste.

“Reduced to Clear” sections have been introduced 

since 2011, where fresh produce that is slightly 

blemished but still wholesome, or that are close to 

expiry are sold at reduced prices. 

Since 2017, we have collaborated with NEA on a 

food waste co-digestion project where source-

segregated food waste collected from 13 of our 

stores and our distribution centre was sent to a 

demonstration facility located at the Ulu Pandan 

Water Reclamation Plant for co-digestion with 

used water sludge daily. The process could yield 

more biogas from the anaerobic digestion process 

compared to the treatment of used water sludge 

alone, thereby enhancing energy recovery. In 

2018, the project was extended incrementally to all 

54 stores, and an estimated 2,340 tonnes of food 

waste generated was successfully diverted.

The Group is also represented as a member in 

the Working Group for the Singapore Standard 

for Food Waste Management for Food Retail 

Establishments and Wholesalers/Distributors by 

the Singapore Standards Council which completed 

its work in 2018. We target to adopt the standard 

by 2019/2020.

Reducing Packaging &amp; Plastic Waste

Plastics are now one of the most common and 

persistent pollutants in our oceans today. Even 

when disposed properly, they take many years 

to decompose and break down, generating 

large amounts of garbage over long periods. If 

not disposed of properly, the bags can pollute 

waterways, clog sewers and have been found in 

oceans affecting the habitat of animals and marine 

creatures.

Sheng Siong’s plastic bags have been made 

partially from recycled plastic. According to a life 

cycle study conducted by the Finnish Environment 

Institute (SYKE) back in 2009, plastic bags made 

from recycled plastic may be the lesser evil of other 

forms of carriers including a reusable cotton bag 

unless it has been reused enough times. However, 

the issue of excessive usage and proper disposal 

remains a key problem for our environment.

In another recent study commissioned by the NEA 

in 2016 and released in 2018, it was concluded 

that because Singapore incinerates our waste, 

promotion of certain types of disposables like 

those made of paper or biodegradable materials 

may not be better for the environment. Instead, 

the better option is for Singapore consumers to 

reduce their impact on the environment by opting 

to use reusable bags and food containers, instead 

of disposables. Therefore, a more sustainable 

approach is to tackle the excessive consumption of 

all types of disposables.

Shoppers in Singapore have become increasingly 

concerned about the excessive consumption of 

plastic bags, while some remain resistant.  The 

possibility of the government implementing a 

plastic bag surcharge seems bleak, but steps have 

been taken with the introduction of the mandatory 

reporting framework for packaging by 2020. In 

gearing up to this new compliance requirement, 

we became a signatory of the Singapore Packaging 

Agreement in 2018. Some of the initiatives we have 

taken include:

1. Reviewing the packaging of our housebrand 

products - the packaging our housebrand 

products fall within the “Lightest” to “Median” 

range of the Packaging Benchmarking Database 

developed by the SPA where information about 

the packaging of the product is available.

2. Making a conscientious effort in the design and 

choice of packaging when developing a new 

housebrand product.

3. Working with suppliers to replace styrofoam 

packing with alternatives wherever possible:

• 

Replaced majority of styrofoam tray packing 

with skin packaging since 2016 for fresh 

meat and seafood products.

• 

Replaced majority of styrofoam tray packing 

with plastic tray/box since 2017/18 for fresh 

fruits and vegetables.

• 

Replaced some styrofoam cartons with 

paper cartons for transport packaging of 

fresh vegetables.

4. Reducing the use of pallet stretch film 

by switching to one of different material 

specifications.

5. First internal review of the use of single-use 

plastic bags in our stores has been completed 

and will form the baseline for target setting by 

2020. 

6. First dialogue session was conducted with 

Cashiers in 2018 to understand their challenges 

in reducing the use of single-use plastic bags, 

and promoting the use of reusable bags.

7. Partnered 

the 

Singapore 

Environmental 

Council in the #onelessplastic campaign

At Sheng Siong, we recognise our ability to influence 

our consumers’ and suppliers’ choices positively. 

We have taken a more pro-active stance in 

campaigning for lesser use of plastic bags among 

our shoppers and will continue to review our 

operational procedures on the bagging of products 

at the checkout counters and weighing stations.

Environment Council One Less Plastic campaign

To date, we continue to retail some basic food 

ingredients like potatoes, onions, and ginger on 

loose display. However, certain fresh produce is 

better sold pre-packed in consideration of hygiene, 

preservation of their freshness and shelf life, and 

reduction of food wastage caused by inappropriate 

handling by consumers. As the supermarket is air-

conditioned, fresh fruits and vegetables tend to 

lose moisture easily. Hence moderate packaging 

can retain the moisture content in fresh produce 

and prevent cross-contamination. We work closely 

with our suppliers to avoid unnecessary packaging 

or use environmentally friendly materials while 

keeping food competitively priced and affordable.

It is clear that everyone has a role to play in 

reducing waste, and greater and more concerted 

efforts from the government, businesses and 

the community are necessary to overcome this 

challenge. 

REUSE

We partner a handful of our suppliers in reusing 

plastic crates for the supply of our fresh vegetables, 

fruits, seafood and eggs. Styrofoam boxes that are 

typically used by suppliers to supply temperature-

sensitive products are also washed, sanitised and 

reused internally. Excess boxes are collected to be 

recycled.

RECYCLE

We sort our waste conscientiously for recycling. 

A paper compacting machine is used to compact 

our products’ carton boxes (collected from the 

stores) into cubes to reduce the space required 

for delivery to the recycling plant. We recycle food 

waste, plastic, wooden pallets, stretched films, 

styrofoam boxes, cans and metals. 

WATER

Water is a scarce resource in Singapore. Our water 

at the Distribution Centre and retail outlets are 

supplied by the public utility company and is used 

mainly in general cleaning, food processing, and 

meal preparation. 

Sheng Siong complies with the NEA’s Environmental 

Protection and Management (Trade Effluent)  

Regulations which regulates the quality of trade 

effluent discharge in Singapore.
