Dear Stakeholders

In 2019, the topic of sustainability has been one of 

our key priorities, amidst global economic volatility, 

climate change and consumer inclinations towards 

sustainable products. At Hanwell, we believe in 

doing well by doing good. As a socially responsible 

company, we treat social and environmental 

sustainability as an integral part of our journey 

forward. We are confident that our commitment to 

sustainability as a core management principle will 

help us to thrive in today’s global economy.

We are pleased to share the highlights of how we 

have progressed in 2019 and will continue to make 

steady improvements to our practices in the years 

to come. 

Supply Chain Sustainability

In 2019, our major rice supplier, CP Intertrade, 

continues to make progress in the Sustainable 

Rice Platform programme (“SRP”). The SRP is 

co-convened by United Nations Environment 

Programme and the International Rice Research 

Institute (“IRRI”) to promote resource efficiency 

and sustainability in trade flows, production and 

Board Statement (102-14, 102-15)





consumption operations, and supply chains in the 

global rice sector. There are six goals under SRP, 

namely food security (traceability), supply chain 

management, biodiversity and eco-system, human 

right and labour, health and safety and climate 

change. This five-year project is targeted to end 

in 2020 and we are confident this programme has 

helped improve the sustainability of CP Intertrade’s 

rice.

Our Environment, Our Responsibility

To reduce Hanwell’s ecological footprint, we have 

started replacing our trucks with improved versions 

that meet the Euro VI Emission Standard. These 

new trucks reduce the emission of air pollutants, 

such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and 

nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission, thus safeguarding 

public health.

We have also made the decision to replace our R22 

aircon condenser with a more environmentally-

friendly 

R-410A 

condenser. 

Comparatively, 

R-410A is more efficient and does not harm the 

ozone layer. 

Our People, Our Asset 

At Hanwell, our people are our greatest assets. As 

such, protecting our employees from occupational 

hazards is of utmost importance to us. Not only 

do we ensure full compliance of applicable laws 

and regulations, we also strive to go above and 

beyond.

To improve productivity and safeguard the safety 

of Hanwell’s audit staff, we made the decision 

to harness emerging technologies by utilising 

drones for our stock count audit. Using drone 

technology, our staff members no longer must 

climb onto the scissor lift to manually count the 

stockpile, reducing their risk of falls and injury. Our 

investment has helped us to transform our audit 

process, reducing manpower and time by 50% 

and 75% respectively.

Heartened by this success, we will be deploying 

more drones and investing in better ones in 2020 

to further streamline our processes. Hanwell 

believes that making the right business decisions 

constitutes winning together with our people. We 

trust that when we take care of our employees, the 

benefits are multi-fold and far reaching.

Commitment to Customers &amp; Community Hanwell 

places the well-being of our customers at the 

heart of our business. We are committed to food 

safety and our customers’ health. While keeping 

a keen eye on our business objectives, we have 

always strived to make positive contributions in 

our community. 

Our subsidiary, Fortune Food Manufacturing Pte 

Ltd (“Fortune Food”), entered into an agreement 

with Loong Soon Kemajuan Sdn. Bhd. to set up a

new manufacturing plant through the acquisition 

of a property in Johor Malaysia. This will allow 

Fortune Food to better manage the quality and 

safety of our products and allow us the flexibility 

to make continuous improvement to our recipe 

and formulas. When our customers trust that we 

put their health first and constantly innovate to 

serve them better, it will help Hanwell to stay at the 

forefront of our industry.

We are also proud to share that Tipex Pte. Ltd. 

(“Tipex”) 

launched 

its 

re-branding 

exercise 

for Beautex &amp; Mood in July 2019 with much 

enthusiasm from our customers. In keeping up 

with market trends, our new and improved tissue 

boxes are designed to look contemporary whilst 

keeping the elements that our customers are 

familiar with.

Corporate Social Responsibility

We have engaged our community in numerous CSR 

events throughout the year. We sponsored rice for 

the “Recycling For Good” Campaign organised by 

Toa Payoh West CC, Tan Tock Seng Physiotherapy 

Day 2019, and the FaithActs Charity event. We also 

continued our partnership with The Straits Times 

School Pocket Money Fund, our Charity Partner 

of 11 years. As with previous years, we enjoyed 

organising the annual “Beautex’s Life’s Beautiful” 

Children Art Competition, where our theme in 

2019, “Clean is Beautiful”, was welcomed with 

much enthusiasm. 

Resource Sustainability Act

In the upcoming years, we pledge to keep in close 

alignment with the Resource Sustainability Act 

2019, which partially came into force on 1 January 

2020. Conscious that we play an important role 

in preserving our environment, we will continue 

to monitor our environmental externalities and 

innovate to redesign durable and recyclable 

packaging that require less materials. We are happy 

to help Singapore in its dedication to building 

climate, economic and resource resilience. 

COVID-19 Outbreak 

The world has been shaken with the recent 

spread of the COVID-19. We are taking active 

measures in ensuring business continuity in our 

human resource management and minimising 

the risk of factory premises becoming a medium 

of transmission. We would like to emphasise to 

our shareholders, employees and society that our 

company takes the precautionary measures very 

seriously and will do everything in our power to 

ensure the safety of the community. 

Going Forward

Striving for sustainability in our operations ties 

us back to our objective of being a purpose-led 

company. We hope to make a difference through 

our sustainability practices in the long-term, 

managing our business through a balance of 

People, Planet and Profit. 

The 

Board 

believes 

that 

creating 

socially 

responsible and environmentally sound policies as 

critical elements of our growth strategy will create 

sustainable economic value for both Hanwell and 

our wider society. We are in this for the long-haul 

and will put in consistent effort to make progress 

in the different aspects of our operations and 

decision making.

We would like to thank all our stakeholders in 

working with us to fulfil our ambitions and we look 

forward to your continued support and partnership.

About the Report (102-1, 102-3, 102-4, 102-50, 102-51, 102-52, 102-48)

Reporting Standards

GRI Standards (102-54)

This report has been prepared in accordance with 

the GRI Standards: Core option. It also complies 

with SGX-ST Listing Rules 711 (A) and (B).

External Assurance (102-56)

The disclosures in this report are not externally 

assured.

Reporting Boundaries (102-46, 103-1)

The Company aims to create public awareness 

about the sustainable value chains behind our 

key brands. Metrics applicable to the GRI core 

disclosures are reported only if they are a good 

representation of the impact of our value chains. 

For example, we do not report the percentage 

of suppliers assessed for social impact because 

many of them have relatively low impact on cost 

of goods sold and business revenue. Instead, we 

focus on discussing the management approach of 

principal suppliers based on their unique upstream 

social and environmental impact and downstream 

business impact through the Group.

Reporting Approach and Framework

We refer to the Global Reporting Initiative (2016) 

(“GRI”) as a framework for disclosure inclusion.

Disclosures revolve around the value chains in our 

key business segments including Topseller, Tipex 

and Fortune Food. We have prioritized our scope 

of reporting as follows:

• Brands that have the greatest impact to the 

Group’s revenues.

• Activities that contribute to our product brand 

equity.

• Industry standards that are considered 

important by stakeholders such as customers, 

principals, suppliers and shareholders.

This is Hanwell’s third Sustainability Report (“Report”). We publish such reports on an annual basis, with 

the previous report in May 2019. This Report covers our sustainability performance and development of 

our headquarters located in Singapore and our key subsidiaries, Topseller Pte Ltd (“Topseller”), Fortune 

Food Manufacturing Pte Ltd (“Fortune Food”) and Tipex Pte Ltd (“Tipex”) for the financial year 1 January 

to 31 December 2019 (FY2019).

No restatements were made from the previous report and there were no significant changes to the 

organisation and our supply chain during this reporting cycle.

Our Sustainability Framework (102-49)

Sustainability Commitment

As a leading FMCG company, it is Hanwell’s 

mission to provide the best in daily essential 

needs to our customers, and we want to do that 

sustainably. With our sustainability framework, 

we are guided to focus on these four key pillars: 

Supply Chain Sustainability, Reducing Footprint, 

Our People, Our Assets and Commitment to 

Customers &amp; Community. We constantly review 

our sustainability strategy, keeping in view the 

risks and opportunities that lie ahead of us 

with a sharp lens of identifying and evaluating 

challenges posed by the macro environment. It is 

our responsibility to do so with care, caution and 

prudence. For instance, the on-going trade tension 

SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH

between the two superpowers – China and the 

United States of America, spat between Japan and 

South Korea, and Brexit, have resulted in relatively 

subdued growth in the region. Notwithstanding 

these challenges, the Group will continue to look 

beyond its current market, exercise vigilance on 

its financial and non-financial exposure, leverage 

more on automation and digital solutions to be 

manpower-smart and lean whilst navigating 

through choppy waters. This ensures that we stay 

resilient and agile in the face of a myriad of threats, 

including climate change, protectionalism and the 

recent COVID-19 outbreak.

SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH

Business Ethics and 

Compliance (102-16, 103-2, 417-2, 417-3, 413-2, 416-2)

The Board and Senior Management are committed 

to conducting business with integrity, consistent 

with the high standards of business ethics, and in 

compliance with all applicable laws and regulatory 

requirements.

In 2019, we had no incident of non-compliance 

with 

socio-economic 

laws 

and 

regulations, 

including legal requirements of marketing and 

advertising practices, where the violation of which 

would result in significant fines or non-monetary 

sanctions to the Company. 

The Board consists of directors with diverse 

expertise and experience in business management, 

accounting, banking and financial, IT, engineering, 

mathematics, economics and industry knowledge. 

They 

are 

capable 

of 

exercising 

objective 

judgment on the corporate affairs of the Company 

independent of our Management. In concurrence 

with the Nominating Committee (“NC”), the Board 

is of the view that the current seven-member 

Board has the appropriate structure, size, diversity 

and composition to provide effective guidance 

and make decisions in the best interests of the 

Group. Our Board has one female Executive 

Director in recognition of the importance of 

gender diversity and its positive impact on making 

balanced decisions. In terms of age diversity, the 

composition of the board comprises at least one 

director each in the age group of his/her forties, 

fifties and sixties respectively. The current Board 

composition reflects a diversity of gender, age, 

skills and knowledge. A graphic presentation of 

Board diversity by gender and age can be found 

in this Sustainability Report 2019 that will be 

published in May 2020.

The Board Diversity Policy was adopted on 9 

November 2018 to assist the NC and the Board 

in identifying prospective Directorship candidates 

who meet the criteria determined by the NC and 

who support the diversity’s objectives (“Board 

Diversity Policy”).

Hanwell recognises that an effective board 

requires directors to possess not only integrity, 

commitment, relevant experience, qualifications 

and skills in carrying out their duties effectively but 

also include having a diverse background as an 

enabler in promoting good corporate governance.

In identifying qualified candidates for nomination 

to the board, the NC will consider prospective 

candidates 

based 

on 

matrices 

like 

merit, 

character, competencies, expertise, skills, track 

record, and background. This is important in 

fostering and nurturing a diverse and inclusive 

culture that solicits multiple perspectives and 

views and is free of conscious or unconscious bias 

and discrimination. The NC is mindful of related 

regulatory requirements (including the Listing Rules 

issued by the Singapore Exchange Securities 

Trading Limited and the Code of Corporate

Governance 2018), and gives due consideration 

to characteristics such as gender, age, ethnicity, 

disability and geographic representation, which 

contribute to board diversity.

The NC may, in addition to conducting its own 

search and selection process, engage qualified 

independent advisors to assist in identifying 

prospective candidates for directorship that meet 

the criteria as determined by the NC and that 

support Hanwell’s diversity objectives.

The Board has established that at least 10% of 

the total number of board seats be reserved for 

women and that the composition of the board 

shall comprise at least one director each in the 

age group of his/her forties, fifties and sixties 

respectively. The NC will review these objectives 

when necessary and recommend changes to this 

policy where appropriate.

In implementing this policy, the NC will take into 

account the Company’s diversity objectives and 

the diverse nature of the business environment in 

which the Company operates whilst maintaining 

flexibility in addressing succession planning. This 

helps to ensure that the Company continues to 

attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on 

the board.

Adherence to the Board Diversity Policy will form 

part of the annual performance of the board and/or 

the board committees of the Company. This policy 

shall be read in conjunction with the prevailing 

terms of reference of the NC.

Fair Employment Practices

Hanwell is a signatory of the Employers’ Pledge 

of Fair Employment Practices with the Tripartite 

Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (“TAFEP”). 

TAFEP works with companies, government and 

unions to adopt and implement fair employment 

practices. 

PDPA

In compliance with the Singapore Personal Data 

Protection Act (No. 26 of 2012), Hanwell has a 

Privacy Policy which outlines how the Company 

handles personal data. Customers and business 

partners can get in touch with Hanwell’s Data 

Protection Officer by mail, email and phone on 

matters concerning their personal data with 

Hanwell.

Anti-Corruption

The Group’s Code of Conduct for its directors, 

management and employees strictly prohibit 

involvement in corruption activities such as the 

acceptance of or giving bribes.

Whistle Blowing Policy

Hanwell is committed to a high standard of business 

ethics and compliance. In line with this commitment, 

we have a Whistle Blowing Policy that provides an 

avenue for employees and external parties to raise 

concerns and offer them reassurance that they 

will be protected from reprisals or victimisation for 

whistle blowing in good faith. For more information

approach in managing stakeholders’ expectations 

to support its long-term strategy. A sustainability 

governance framework was put in place to 

identify, engage with, and manage the material 

environment, social and governance factors 

important to stakeholders and to the Group.

As a leading FMCG company listed on the 

Singapore Exchange, the Company prides itself 

in its ability to create sustainable value through 

numerous business activities with our stakeholders. 

Sustainability, in the manner to which the Company 

conducts its day-to-day dealings with customers, 

suppliers, employees and society, has consistently 

been one of the key corporate values motivating 

and inspiring us to do our best. Accordingly, this 

Sustainability Report would be announced through 

SGXNet in May 2020.

The Corporate Governance Report 2019 alongside 

this Sustainability Report, together with the Annual 

Report 2019, aims to provide comprehensive 

and transparent reporting of the Group’s overall 

objectives and performance to the Company’s 

stakeholders. The Company welcomes feedback 

on this Sustainability Report and its sustainability 

performance. Please address all feedback to 

Investor Relations, which can be found at the 

Company corporate website at the URL http://

www.hanwell.com.sg 

that 

is 

maintained 

to 

communicate and engage with stakeholders.

More information on the Company’s material 

stakeholders, sustainability efforts (including its 

strategy and key areas of focus), and performance 

can be found in the Company’s Sustainability 

Report uploaded at the Company’s corporate 

website.

The key stakeholders that we engage are the 

groups that our business has a significant impact 

on, and those with a vested interest in our 

operations. By assessing the significance and 

impact of their interest on our businesses, we have 

identified eight key stakeholder groups.

REGULATORS 

Beyond regulatory 

compliance, we partner 

with government agencies 

to jointly raise industry 

standards for food and 

product safety, food security 

and other sustainability 

practices, as well as 

workplace safety and health 

standards.

INDUSTRY BODIES 

(eg Forest Stewardship Council)

Our business activities have 

economic, environmental, 

and social impacts on the 

communities where we 

operate. Therefore, it is 

critical that we work with 

Industry bodies to promote 

sustainability in our value 

chain.

EMPLOYEES

Our employees’ performance 

is key to our success. 

Their health and safety, 

competencies, welfare and 

professional development are 

fundamental 

to Hanwell’s performance. 

We aim to develop 

their potential to drive 

innovation, productivity and 

organisational excellence.

SUPPLIERS

(eg rice mills and manufacturers)

We work closely with our 

suppliers in our value chain 

to ensure that our products 

conform with industry safety 

standards, to improve 

product range and to reduce 

risks related to sustainability 

issues.

CUSTOMERS

(hotels &amp; supermarkets) &amp; Civil 

Society (e.g. retail consumers)

Customers and Civil Society 

are crucial to our business 

success. We strive to create

Programmes for Upgrading 

Employee Skills, Transition 

Assistance Programmes and 

Performance Review (404-2, 404-3)

To align employees’ competencies, job function 

and the company’s strategies, we conduct the 

Training Needs Analysis (“TNA”) to tighten the 

competency gaps for departments and plan for 

employee’s training programmes to provide them 

with relevant up-skilling opportunities.

Our trainings are generic with a focus on technical 

skills-based training. This helps to develop our 

staff holistically and enable them to adapt to new 

job demands. Examples of the courses we provide 

include PDPA as well as the Workplace Safety &amp; 

Health.

For employees who wish to upgrade themselves 

by further study, we sponsor their school fees 

partially or in full, depending on the circumstance 

and their need.

We also provide our employees with transition 

assistance programmes in the event of a company 

restructuring. Other than the severance pay 

package, where we take the affected employee’s 

service length into account, we also engage the 

assistance of e2i to help our affected Singaporeans 

and Singapore Permanent Resident workers 

on employment opportunities and their training 

needs. e2i shares relevant programmes and 

initiatives like employment and training advisory 

which the affected employees can tap into to 

better understand their career options or take up 

employability skills courses for skills upgrading. 

Our employees receive regular feedback from 

their supervisors on their work performance and 

we have a 100% participant rate in our annual 

performance review for all gender and employee 

categories.

Leave and Benefits (401-2, 401-3)

In Singapore, we provide standard benefits to 

temporary staff and part-timers who have worked 

with us for at least three consecutive months. The 

benefits include:

1) Insurance: Group Personal Accident Insurance 

(including death and total permanent disability), 

Group Hospital &amp; Surgical insurance, Work 

Injury Insurance.

2) Medical 

3) Statutory leave (e.g. maternity, paternity, shared 

parental leave)

4) Exam leave for employees who are pursuing 

part time studies

5) Flexible benefits. Due to the diverse 

composition of employees who have various 

needs at different stages in life, our flexible 

benefits plans allow them to choose the benefits 

that best suits their current needs. An example 

of our benefits includes the claiming of holiday 

expenses to spend quality time with their family. 

In alignment with our workplace health initiative, 

employees can also make claims for health 

screening and gym membership under this 

benefit.

6) Workplace Health + Funding Programme. 

This is a programme initiated by the Health 

Promotion Board (“HPB”), where employees

Workplace Safety

In Singapore, we piloted the feasibility of using 

drones to conduct our bi-annual stock check. 

This helps to reduce stock taking time, manpower 

costs and workplace injury compared to previous 

methods which required employees to climb onto 

the basket of the forklift scissor lift to manually 

count inventory. The accuracy rate of using a 

drone in counting the stockpile is equivalent to that 

of manual counting. With this encouraging result, 

we intend to invest in better drones in 2020. 

COVID-19 

As we focus on sustaining our businesses during 

this challenging period, our employees’ health and 

safety remains at the top of our priorities as well.

Measures:

• Work-from-home arrangements and 

empowering employees with the necessary 

tools

• Social distancing to ensure safety of employees

• Rigorous cleaning for offices, manufacturing 

and warehousing facilities that are open

Technologies:

Replacement for Fingerprint Door Access Devices

Our human resources team has activated 

employee cards for our employees to access 

our office space, instead of utilising the regular 

Fingerprint Door Access service. 

High Volume Low Speed (HVLS) fan

HVLS fans are efficient and cost-effective in 

ventilating warehouses. They help to maintain 

good air quality, making it more comfortable for 

our employees working at our warehouses. We 

have installed 6 HLVS fans in our Rice Stockpile 

and 2 fans in our Dry Warehouse in Singapore to 

help in combating the heat during the dry weather. 

Hiring Special Needs (413-1)

As part of our corporate citizenship, we worked 

with Association for Persons with Special Needs 

(“ASPN”) to provide employment opportunities for 

the less fortunate. Two special needs employees 

have been working with Fortune Food since 2014 

and are coping well with their assigned job scope. 

When they first started, we arranged an 

onboarding orientation, factory tour and provided 

an ongoing on-the-job (“OTJ”) training for them. 

ASPN also conducted a sharing session for 

relevant Fortune Food Manufacturing staff, from 

production supervisors to HR personnel and 

factory managers, to help them understand the 

working styles of their colleagues from ASPN and 

learn to be mindful of their needs. 

Both employees have thrived with Fortune Food 

and are currently part of our permanent staff count.

Reducing Carbon Footprint 

(302-1, 302-2, 302-3, 303-4, 305-2, 305-5)

At Hanwell, we are conscious of our environmental 

footprint and have been actively working to reduce 

them. The Group has been diligently tracking our 

energy and water consumptions over the years: 

Environmentally Friendly Vehicles

In 2019, we started to replace our old trucks 

with new trucks that meet Euro VI Emission 

Standard. These new trucks reduce the emission 

of air pollutants such as fine particulate matter 

(PM2.5) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission, thus 

safeguard public health.

10 new trucks were purchased in 2019 - seven 

chilled 12-footer trucks under Topseller, two 

24-footer trucks and one 14-footer truck under 

Tipex.

For the year 2020, we plan to replace nine of our 

existing trucks with new Euro VI Emission Standard 

trucks – six chilled 12-footer trucks under Topseller 

and two 14-footer trucks and one 10-footer truck 

under Tipex.

Ozone Friendly Aircon Condenser

To do our part in protecting the ozone layer, we 

also replaced our existing R22 aircon condenser to 

a more environmentally friendly R-410A condenser.

In comparison to R22, the R-410A condenser 

is more energy-efficient. Moreover, with many 

companies phasing out production of the R22, 

replacing broken parts might pose a challenge in 

future. Hence, the switch over to the R-410A will 

be more cost-effective in the long run. 

Solar Panel (305-5)

In our efforts to reduce dependency on fossil fuels 

consumption, we installed Photovoltaic (“PV”) 

panels on the top of our roof of our Singapore 

office as an alternative energy source. Our grid 

connection was completed in May 2018 and it is 

currently supplying electricity to three blocks on 

our premise. The installation of solar panels helps 

us offset an equivalent of 606’410 kg CO2 in one 

year* or an equivalent of 27,564 trees**.

*0.4313kg CO2/kWh x 1’406’000kWh = 606’410kg 

CO2

** assuming 22kg of CO2 per tree annually

kets, grocery stores, caterers, institutions, ship 

chandlers, hotels, restaurants, food courts, hawk-

er centres and online retailers in Singapore. 

Our main rice supplier is Charoen Pokphand 

Intertrade (“CP Intertrade”), from Thailand.

The Importance of Good 

Agricultural Practices (103-1)

Rice is the Group’s top selling FMCG product 

category and Royal Umbrella is our best-selling 

brand of rice.

As the global food supply chain evolves, it has 

become increasingly complicated to track the 

source of food through different layers of the 

supply chain. However, food traceability has 

also become increasingly important, depicted by 

three main reasons. Firstly, regarding food safety 

issues, companies should be able to quickly trace 

through the supply chain to ascertain the source 

of a food product. It is critical that we can do so 

effectively, with public health and lives at stake, in 

addition to the livelihoods of industries, companies 

and employees. Secondly, more responsible 

consumers are demanding to understand the 

sources of their food and whether they are grown 

and manufactured sustainably - from sourcing, 

to production, to transportation, as well as the 

nutrition content present in the everyday food 

consumables. Thirdly, by understand our own 

supply chain, our business can understand and 

mitigate our risks.

Our main rice supplier, CP Intertrade, has invested 

significantly in the improvement of its supply chain 

performance, through switching up its suppliers 

and processes, training employees, and setting 

up monitoring and reporting mechanisms. It has 

started many initiatives to ensure that their rice is 

grown sustainably. CP Intertrade works closely with 

rice-growing communities to ensure sustainable 

development. 

Their 

production 

process 

is 

fully compliant with GAP+ (Good Agricultural 

Practices Plus). GAP+ helps famers upgrade their 

knowledge and skills in rice production and raise 

their standards of living, ultimately improving the 

quality of rice.

Responsible Sourcing (103-2)

We have 12 rice suppliers located across the 

world, including Thailand, Vietnam, India, USA 

and Japan. Thailand supplies the bulk of our 

rice stock and we work with our Thai suppliers 

closely. We often update them about consumer 

and governmental requirements so that they are 

prepared for the changing needs. For example, 

our Thai rice suppliers are looking into using 

biodegradable plastics for their packaging.

We screen new suppliers, making sure they 

abide by the necessary food safety requirements 

(HACCP, ISO14001, ISO9000). Our procurement 

officers also do on-site visits to ensure that the 

factories are safe and clean, understand how 

they maintain hygiene standards in the premises 

and do thorough checks about staff welfare. We 

also conduct yearly audits for existing suppliers to 

ensure their production environment are kept up to 

the required standards.

Hanwell has been working closely with our long-

term main rice supplier CP Intertrade in Thailand in 

the topics of food traceability and good agriculture 

practices. Under the Sustainable Rice Platform 

programme, 30 CP employees have undergone 

governance training under the programme and 

CP Intertrade has fully met 15 of 23 sustainable 

agriculture standards. 

Another programme that CP Intertrade embarked 

on was the Royal Umbrella Sustainability Rice 

Cultivation Campaign. Since 2016, it has helped to 

improve the livelihood of Thai Hom Mali rice farmers 

and their community sustainability by ensuring that 

all agricultural products from the rice farmers are 

quality controlled, environment-friendly and sold at 

a fair market price. The project aims to promote 

Agriculture Practice under GAP PLUS (Good 

Agriculture Practice Plus). The system is certified 

by the Rice Department, the Ministry of Agriculture 

and Cooperative. It has also been recognized for 

Quality Control, Food Safety, and Greenhouse gas 

emission reduction. So far, we have worked with 

6,021 agriculturists in the project covering a total 

land area of 153,527 Rai.

Product Labeling (417-1)

As a responsible company, it is our duty to educate 

our consumers on various aspects of the value 

chain so that they can make informed decisions 

before purchasing. 

Our Thai Hom Mali rice is traceable. The rice’s 

DNA Tested is verified and consumers can be 

assured that our rice does not contain adulterants. 

Our customers may scan the QR code on our 

packaging to get more information about our rice 

and its traceability. 

Other than the QR code, we also printed the 

logo of the Best Rice Award from the World Rice 

Conference, a prestigious award that we received 

from the Department of Foreign Trade (Thailand), 

and product information on our packaging. It is our 

hope that this will provide our customers with an 

assurance on our product quality and standards.

Care for Local Communities 

(413-1)

Participation of “Recycling For Good” 

Campaign 

As part of our climate action plan, one area of 

contribution was to encourage recycling to reduce 

pollution caused by waste. 

In June 2019, we partnered up with Toa Payoh 

West CC Youth Executive Committee to organise 

a recycling campaign targeted at the Toa Payoh 

residents. This event was to create awareness in 

practicing and making recycling a good daily living 

habit for a better, healthier and more sustainable 

environment. The residents were encouraged 

to bring their recycling paper (e.g. newspaper, 

cardboard) to the recycling booth. As an incentive, 

each participant was rewarded with a packet of 

Golden Peony. 

As part of this campaign, Topseller contributed 

300 packets of 500gram Golden Peony Brown rice 

and offered special discounts on 250 packets of 

1kg Golden Peony Brown Rice. We were proud of 

our employees for volunteering at the redemption 

booth to assist the committee during the event. 

Sponsorship of FaithActs Charity

In August and September, Topseller sponsored 

370 packets of 1kg Royal Umbrella rice for the 

FaithActs Charity event. FaithActs is a non-

profit community service agency serving the 

needs of children, youths, families and seniors in 

Singapore. The rice was distributed to the senior 

participants after the workout event at the Dover &amp; 

Commonwealth estates. 

Sponsorship for the Tan Tock Seng 

Physiotherapy Day 2019

Topseller sponsored 600 packets of 500gm 

Golden Peony brown rice to the Tan Tock Seng 

Physiotherapy Day 2019, where we gave out good 

quality and nutritious brown rice to participants, 

of whom included patients and nurses. More than 

600 residents turned up at the Ang Mo Kio Central 

Stage and the Tan Tock Seng hospital’s atrium to 

lend their support. 

Our participants learnt about the benefits of 

eating and working out in moderation through a 

progressive exercise regime. This keeps the body fit 

and helps manage and prevent chronic conditions. 

Participants were given tips of modifying and 

tailoring their physical activities and eating habits 

to alleviate chronic health issues. 

The event served as a beacon for all participants 

to identify the signs and symptoms of a declining 

state of health and cultivate healthy eating and 

exercising habits.

Activities, Primary Brands, 

Products, Services (102-2)

Fortune Food Manufacturing Pte Ltd (“Fortune 

Food”) specializes in the production of an 

extensive range of tofu, ranging from Traditional 

Chinese Tofu, Japanese Silken Tofu, Egg Tofu to 

Tau Kwa. These tofu varieties are marketed under 

the brand name of Fortune.

Countries of Operation (102-4), 

Markets Served (102-6), 

Supply Chain (102-9)

Fortune Food uses the finest beans from North 

America and eggs from local farms to produce 

our soya bean-based products. Our Singapore 

manufacturing facility is FSSC22000 certified 

and our products are sold in local supermarkets, 

F&amp;B retail outlets and general trade outlets like 

provision shops and minimarts. 

Food Quality and Safety (416-1)

Food safety is one of our customers’ primary 

concerns. Due to ever-changing food habits, 

complex supply chain and globalization of our 

food supply, the need to strengthen food safety 

systems between suppliers and manufacturers 

are becoming more important. The Group views 

any incident of food contamination very seriously. 

We are aware that if there is a product recall, 

our reputation and customer’s confidence and 

loyalty to our brands will take a hit, ultimately also 

translating into financial losses. 

Fortune Food adheres to stringent food safety 

standards and complies with relevant food safety 

regulations. From raw material management, to 

production and process control, and finished 

goods assurance, we apply our quality standards 

based on a set of best practices and industry

To ensure food quality and safety, as well as the 

flexibility to improve our product recipes and 

formula, we decided to set up an alternative 

manufacturing plant in Johor Bahru (Malaysia). By 

having full control of our manufacturing facility, we 

can also quickly cater to the evolving demand and 

needs of our customers more effectively.

The quality of our food ingredients is key to food 

safety. Foods and the ingredients in food products 

are increasingly grown, processed and consumed 

in different locations around the globe. We place 

stringent requirements in selecting our ingredients 

and pick only the best. Our beans are non-GMO 

certified from farms in North America and our eggs 

are locally farmed in Singapore. Our procurement 

officers visit the chicken farms regularly to inspect 

the health of the chicken and quality of chicken 

feeds.

With the ageing population and the fight against 

diabetes, our government has been actively 

encouraging healthy living. Over the years, the 

Health Promotion Board (“HPB”) has created 

numerous initiatives and schemes to encourage 

Singaporeans to eat healthily. One such initiative 

is the ‘Healthier Choice’ symbol on packaged food 

products. This symbol indicates that the products 

are healthier options and makes it easy for 

consumers to make informed purchasing decisions 

that are better for their diet. Many of our tofu 

products have been marked as healthier choice 

products and all our products are preservative-

free. In view of rising consumer awareness of the 

importance of good health, improved standards 

of living, as well as our government’s increasing 

emphasis on the healthy eating, Fortune Food 

introduced several healthier choice products. One 

such product is our cholesterol free tofu product 

with DHA from vegetarian sources. 

Responsible Sourcing (204-1)

Local production is an important secondary 

strategy in ensuring food supply resilience for 

Singapore. Today, our local farms produce 10% of 

the fish, 13% of the vegetables and 27% of the 

eggs we consume in Singapore. The Singapore 

Food Agency (“SFA”) has set the target for local 

foods to meet 30% of Singapore’s nutritional 

needs by 2030. We at Fortune Food are supporting 

local farmers to help achieve the “30 by 30” vision.

The eggs for our egg tofu are 100% local. One 

of our suppliers received the Certified Humane 

label by the American non-profit organisation 

Humane Farm Animal Care (“HFAC”). The eggs 

are responsibly produced and ethically farmed. 

All eggs produced from Singapore farms are 

antibiotics-free as egg farmers in Singapore are 

not allowed to use antibiotics on their hens.

By purchasing eggs from local farmers, we help to 

sustain the local farming community and reduce 

our carbon footprint. Furthermore, food traceability 

helps to improve customers’ confidence and 

allows us to manage our supply chain.

Product Labeling (417-1)

It is important that consumers understand the 

nutritional benefits of the food products they buy as 

it empowers them to make informed food choices. 

In response to regulatory requirements and 

consumer expectations, our product packaging 

provides transparent and easy-to-understand 

product information.

The 

Healthier 

Choice 

Symbol 

(“HCS”) 

on 

packaged food products indicates that they are 

healthier options. Food products awarded the 

HCS are generally lower in fat, sodium and sugar, 

and are higher in calcium and in dietary fibre. We 

work closely with Health Promotion Board as an 

industry partner in the Healthier Choice Symbol 

Programme. 22 of our tofu products attained the 

Healthier Choice Symbol 1

KEY SUBSIDIARY - TIPEX PTE LTD (102-1)

Activities, Primary Brands, 

Products, Services (102-2)

Tipex is one of the major distributors of consumer 

tissue paper products in Singapore. We own 

the local leading tissue paper brand Beautex, 

manufactured by its subsidiary Tips Industry (M) 

Sdn Bhd in Malaysia. Besides Beautex, Tipex also 

owns tissue paper brands Ichiryu, Mood, Hibis, 

Comfy and Parity.

Countries of Operation (102-4), 

Markets Served (102-6), 

Supply Chain (102-9)

Tipex’s distribution network covers supermarkets 

and hypermarkets, general retail trade, pharmacies, 

medical halls and institutions in both Singapore 

and Malaysia. In addition, Tipex’s products are 

exported to New Zealand, Brunei, Australia, 

Vietnam, Maldives, India and Philippines. 

We have a factory in Malaysia under Tips Industry 

(M) Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tipex. 

The factory procures paper rolls and converts 

them into packaged tissue paper products.

Responsible Sourcing and 

Caring for the Environment 

(103-2)

Over the years, recurring haze has cast the spotlight 

on sustainable sourcing for paper companies. 

We are fully aware that the pulp and paper 

industry plays a critical role 

in shaping forests worldwide, 

as pulpwood is grown in a 

vast range of landscapes and 

societies. As an environmentally 

sensitive company, we try to 

create a vision of care and 

continually ensure that all our 

supplies are purchased from 

sustainable sources. We buy 

paper that comes either from 

well-managed forests or from 

recycled material. All our Pulp paper is from 

qualified suppliers that are ISO 9001, ISO 14001 

and FSC certified.  

Forest 

Stewardship 

Council 

(“FSC”) 

is 

an 

independent, non-profit organization that promotes 

the responsible management of the world’s forests. 

It provides an assurance that products such as 

wood and paper have been harvested in a socially 

and environmentally responsible manner. FSC 

Chain-of-Custody certification traces the path of 

products from the initial source, through the supply 

chain and up to the end user.

Sourcing our paper sustainably supports our 

commitment 

to 

environmental 

sustainability, 

strengthens our supply chain and helps build trust 

among consumers. We hope to demonstrate our 

commitment to help prevent the loss of biodiversity 

and climate change caused by deforestation and 

will not harm the forests in our sourcing process. 

Tips Industry Malaysia currently works with eight 

FSC pulp paper suppliers, of which three are 

from Indonesia, two from Vietnam, and one each 

from China, Taiwan and Malaysia. Three of these 

suppliers are new.  

We also purchase recycled paper from suppliers 

in the region – three from Malaysia, two from 

Indonesia and Vietnam and one from Taiwan. 

Of these, two are new suppliers. To ensure the 

authenticity of their claims, we request that 

suppliers produce official documents (e.g. Product 

certificate of analysis)

We treat the disposal of waste seriously as improper 

disposable methods can harm the environment 

and health of the community. At our Malaysian 

factory, we identify and classify waste into different 

categories. For waste containing hazardous 

elements or compounds, we will dispose them 

as per Malaysia’s DOE – Environmental Quality 

(Scheduled Wastes) Regulation 2005.

At Tips Industry Malaysia, we believe the best 

method for the environment is in controlling and 

minimizing paper waste. We adhere strictly to the 

ISO14001 Environmental Management System &amp; 

local environmental rules and regulations.

Product Labeling (417-1)

In response to packaging trends, Tipex conducted 

a rebranding exercise for our Beautex products 

this year and launched the new packaging in July 

2019. To garner more awareness, we decided 

to align our new tagline “Clean is Beautiful” with 

the theme of our annual art competition. It is 

our hope that it will allow both parents and their 

children to appreciate the true meaning behind 

“Clean is Beautiful”. The modern and dynamic 

new packaging helps the brand to capture the 

attention of the younger market. The tulip, integral 

to Beautex’s brand identity, has been retained after 

gleaning marketing insights from the focus groups 

that we held. 

Our logos on our packaging inform consumers 

about 

our 

forest 

management 

certification 

schemes. According to a survey done by YouGov 

in November 2017, 56% of Singaporeans believe 

businesses have a responsibility to prevent 

environmental damage2. This research shows 

that a considerable proportion of consumers give 

weight to a brand’s ethics when making purchasing 

decisions. To ensure that paper, our main raw 

material, is from a sustainable source, we only 

buy FSC certified pulp paper. Other than product 

descriptions and usage of products, we display 

the FSC certification logo on our packaging to give 

our consumers peace of mind when they purchase 

Beautex products.

Art Competition and Philanthropy (201-1)

This year, Tipex held its 11th “Beautex’s Life’s 

Beautiful” Children Art Competition with school 

children at the Singapore Flyer in June, in 

partnership with The Straits Times School Pocket 

Money Fund. This annual competition is open to 

all primary school students. Our objective was 

to encourage and embrace a participative and 

cohesive community spirit and deepen Tipex’s 

engagement with its stakeholders. 

In coordination with the launch of our new 

packaging, the theme for this year’s competition 

is “Clean is Beautiful”. A total of 124 students 

participated and the winning art works were 

featured on Beautex tissue boxes. 20cents per 

pack of 5 boxes sold was donated to The Straits 

Times School Pocket Money Fund. We managed 

to raise $27,635.60 from this campaign and the 

proceeds was donated to The Straits Times 

School Pocket Money Fund. We hope that through 

this competition, we can advocate the importance 

of family togetherness and move towards a 

progressive, healthier and more inclusive society.

Since 2009, this campaign has been growing in 

contribution and to date, we have donated more 

than $250,000 to various charities.

Life is Beautiful

Tipex continued its partnership with The Straits 

Times School Pocket Money Fund as Charity 

Partner and Topseller, which is the sole distributor 

of the Royal Umbrella Rice locally, as Supporting 

Partner, to encourage and embrace a participative 

and cohesive community spirit. Through this 

initiative, we hope to deepen and broaden Tipex’s 

Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives in 

engaging its stakeholders, particularly children, 

who will be the future pillars of society. This was 

done through fostering family bonding amongst 

the young participants and their parents through 

an annual “Beautex’s Life’s Beautiful” Children 

Art Competition, with the 2019 theme of “Clean is 

Beautiful”. 

The objective is to advocate the importance of 

family togetherness and healthy living through 

the hosting of an art competition towards caring 

and sharing so as to move towards a progressive, 

healthier and more inclusive society.

provide better and safer working environment to our 

workers. At the same time, the new environment 

will help to improve product safety.

 

We also helped to improve the road conditions for 

the community by extending road tarmac on roads
