Board Statement 

 

The Board of Directors and Management of G. K. Goh Holdings Limited (the “Company”) and its 

subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) are committed to creating long-term value for all its stakeholders 

through sustainable business strategies and practices. 

 

Together with Management, the Board identifies the key stakeholders, determines the material 

Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) factors to be managed, and oversees the management 

and monitoring of these factors. 

 

 

Organisation Profile 

 

The Group has evolved from its origins as a leading Singapore-based regional securities business into 

an investment company owning operating businesses as well as a diverse portfolio of investments. 

 

The Group has operating businesses in Corporate Services and Aged Care: 

 

 

The Corporate Services business is housed under Boardroom Limited (“Boardroom”), a leading 

regional corporate services provider in Asia and Australia. 

 

 

The Aged Care business is operated through Allium Healthcare Holdings Pte Ltd (“Allium”), which 

provides a suite of services emphasising a holistic continuum of long-term personalised eldercare.  

The portfolio in Singapore includes Allium Care Studio and Allium Care Suites, offering day care 

and residential care respectively.   

 

 

Allium has also invested in Opal Aged Care Group, a leading Australian provider of residential 

aged care services; and Habitat Assets Pte Ltd, a fund that invests in a portfolio of operating 

retirement villages in Australia. 

 

The Financial Investments arm holds a portfolio of listed and unlisted equities as well as third-party 

managed funds. 

 

 

Approach to Sustainability 

 

Sustainability to the Group is about creating long-term shareholder and social value by building and 

investing in well-governed companies that contribute positively to society.  Through Allium, the Group 

is making a commitment to play a constructive and progressive role in meeting the geriatric care needs 

of Singapore’s rapidly ageing population.  Allium’s first Singapore nursing home, Allium Care Suites, 

started its operations in Venus Drive in November 2019. 

 

As an investment company, its sustainability work centres around supporting investee companies that 

implement sound values and structures for sustainable development. 

 

The Group also supports local businesses and helps to create jobs through the goods and services 

purchased from its suppliers, which includes office space providers, food vendors, technology and 

information services providers, as well as professional consultants.

Material ESG Factors 

 

Keeping in mind the key concerns of the Group’s stakeholders, the Board has identified the following 

material ESG factors for FY2020: 

 

 

Employees; 

 

Environment; and 

 

Anti-corruption. 

 

The Board will continue to identify and evaluate the material ESG factors against both the changing 

business landscape and key business developments to ensure that they remain relevant. 

 

 

Employees 

 

The Group recognises that its ability to remain commercially viable and competitive is influenced by its 

continued success in attracting and retaining talent.  It is committed to building a safe, nurturing and 

inclusive workforce where all employees are treated respectfully and professionally, and are given equal 

opportunity based on merit.  The remuneration framework for all employees comprises a fixed 

component in the form of a base salary and a variable component in the form of a bonus.  The bonus 

is linked to the Group’s and the employee’s performance. 

 

The Group encourages its employees to further their potential by supporting lifelong learning and skills 

development.  Employees who attend courses that are related to their fields of specialty are able to 

seek reimbursement for the course fees.  They are also entitled to 2 days of exam or study leave each 

year. 

 

In caring for the wellbeing of the employees, the Group offers a range of benefits to allow employees 

achieve better work-life balance.  These benefits include annual leave, parental leave, portable 

healthcare benefits and life and accident insurance.  The Group also offers flexible work options such 

as staggered working hours and work-from-home arrangements. 

 

Protecting employees’ safety and wellbeing was especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic.  

The Group increased the frequency of cleaning and disinfection of its premises and ensured that they 

were well-stocked with hand sanitisers and hand soap.  Masks were also distributed to all employees.  

Temperature screening and safe distancing measures were strictly adhered to.  Employees who were 

able to work from home were split into two teams, and no more than 50% of those employees returned 

to the workplace at any time. 

 

During the circuit breaker period, arrangements were made, as far as possible, for client-facing 

employees of Allium Care Suites to stay on-site in order to create a protected environment within the 

nursing home.  Employees who stayed in their own residences were required to take dedicated 

transport to and from work.  All employees in Allium Care Suites also underwent regular COVID-19 

swab tests.  The Group is pleased to report that there were no COVID-19 cases among the employees 

and nursing home residents during the year.

As at 31 December 2020, the Group’s Aged Care and Financial Investments business units employed 

a total of 111 permanent employees, comprising of 109 full-time and 2 part-time employees, all located 

in Singapore.  The increase in headcount was in line with expectation as the Aged Care business unit 

ramped up its operations.  There were no temporary employees.  The rates of new employee hires and 

employee turnover during the year were 44% and 22% respectively.  The Group targets to reduce the 

turnover rate to below 20%.

Environment 

 

Allium Care Suites accounts for the majority of the Group’s direct environmental impact.  To manage 

its environmental footprint, the Group has committed to design and construct a green, sustainable 

building which is energy effective and resource efficient.  Allium Care Suites is the first private nursing 

home in Singapore to receive the BCA Green Mark1 Platinum for its sustainable building. 

 

As a BCA Green Mark Platinum certified nursing home, it is designed and built with a climatic responsive 

design in mind.  Glass of low heat transmittance is used to ensure lower heat gain into the building.  

Minimising thermal heat gain through the building envelope and roof can enhance indoor thermal 

comfort and reduce the energy needed to condition the indoor environment. 

 

Allium Care Suites is also equipped with a building management system that monitors electricity and 

major water use.  The building uses energy-efficient unitary air-conditioning system and is fitted with 

LED lights with high frequency ballasts, thereby reducing flickering incidents which are damaging to the 

eyes.  Motion sensors are used at staircases, corridors and washrooms to moderate the luminaries and 

reduce energy usage when the areas are unoccupied.  The use of solar tubes draws in natural daylight 

from the third floor to the first floor of the building, and has a duo effect of saving energy as well as 

enhancing the illuminance.  Drawing on nature’s free resource, solar photovoltaic panels integrated with 

rooftop trellis provide shelter and replace a portion of the total building energy consumption. 

 

In terms of water efficiency, the building uses “Excellent” WELS-rated water fittings and a rainwater 

harvesting tank has been installed to collect rainwater for landscape irrigation.  In addition, the use of 

drip irrigation system over conventional sprinkler irrigation system ensures efficient and effective 

irrigation of the landscape. 

 

Alongside our energy and water conservation efforts, material selection is quintessential to Allium Care 

Suites.  Low carbon concrete certified by the Singapore Green Building Council is used for the 

construction of the building.  For the purpose of enhancing indoor environmental quality for occupants, 

low VOC paint is used for the finishing in the interior spaces. 

 

 

Allium Care Suites – Companion Suite 

 

1 BCA Green Mark is a green building rating system to evaluate a building for its environmental impact and performance. It 

provides a comprehensive framework for assessing the overall environmental performance of new and existing buildings to 

promote sustainable design, construction and operations practices in buildings.

Energy consumption increased in FY2020 due to the ramped up operations at Allium Care Suites. 

 

The Group had elected to send electronic copies of annual reports to shareholders with effect from 

2020 in order to reduce paper usage.  Shareholders are encouraged to download the reports from 

SGXNET or the Company’s website.  Hard copies are sent only upon shareholders’ requests. 

 

 

Anti-corruption 

 

The Group adopts a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption, and employees are expected 

to conduct their business activities in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  All 

employees are guided by a code of ethics and business conduct (“Code of Ethics”) and code of best 

practices on securities transactions (“Code of Best Practices”), which are disseminated to them at the 

start of their employment.  Further information on the Codes can be found in the Corporate Governance 

section of the Annual Report 2020. 

 

The Group has put in place a Whistleblowing Policy to provide an avenue for all stakeholders to raise 

concerns about possible improprieties within the Group, and to provide assurance that whistleblowers 

will be protected from victimisation.  A copy of the policy can be found on the Company’s website at 

https://www.gkgoh.com/compliance.aspx. 

 

The Group has also developed a Procurement Policy to ensure that its procurement process is fair, and 

to reduce the risk of complaints and legal challenges.  The policy specifies the procedures in all aspects 

of the procurement process, from requests for quotations to dispute resolution, and will be reviewed 

periodically for relevance. 

 

The Group is pleased to report that there were no incidents of bribery or corruption during the year.

Our Commitment to Ethics and Integrity 

 

Similarly, the Board is committed to upholding high standards of good corporate governance, professionalism 

and integrity in the Company.  

 

We have based our corporate governance framework on timely disclosures, transparency and accountability, so 

that we can create, maintain and safeguard the value and interests of our shareholders. 

 

Integral to our commitment is the high priority we place on ethical business conduct, in markets where we 

operate.  

 

 

Professional Ethics of Our Employees 

Employees are expected to comply with our Code of Conduct (found within our Employee Handbook), which 

outlines the standards of behaviour in displaying responsible conduct, honesty and integrity. It also provides 


 6 

details on misconduct by employees – such as what actions constitute as misconduct, as well as the disciplinary 

procedures which the company will carry out if misconduct does occur. The Code also highlights grievance 

procedures for employees, free of reprisals, should they be treated unfairly. 

Client-serving employees are also required to conduct themselves according to the highest possible ethical 

standards, bound by BoardRoom’s adoption of the Professional Ethics Statements and Code of Conduct issued 

by the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants and the Chartered Secretaries Institute of Singapore where 

relevant.  

Anti-Corruption and Compliance 

We have a strict policy regarding gifts from clients, where employees may not receive any gift or advantage from 

any person or company with a business relationship with BoardRoom, without the knowledge and consent of 

the Director. 

 

No incidences of corruption or non-compliances with regulations (resulting in fines or non-monetary sanctions) 

were reported in FY20. 

 

For FY21, we are planning for a review and updates to the Anti-Corruption and Bribery policy, Diversity, Equality 

and Inclusivity policy and our Environment, Social and Governance policy to ensure that we keep up-to-date with 

all the latest developments and changes.  

 

Our Approach to Handling Complaints 

Our Whistle-Blowing Policy 

 

BoardRoom has in place a whistle-blowing policy open to all relevant internal stakeholders, such as directors, 

employees (full-time, part-time and contract), as well as external stakeholders such as vendors, clients and 

contractors, to raise complaints on any matter which could be a violation of our principles. 

 

This includes matters regarding accounting, auditing, internal or accounting controls which are questionable or 

not in accordance with generally-accepted practices prescribed by BoardRoom. It also covers serious concerns 

that could have an impact on the Company, such as unlawful acts, health and safety issues, actions that could 

cause environmental damage, the concealing of unethical actions or any other form of improper conduct. Our 

whistle-blowing policy also refers to any action taken by any employee which obstructs another employee to 

exercise his/her right to make such reports. 

 

Throughout 2020, we ensured that all employees had access to our whistleblowing policy by ensuring that it is 

available on Engagedly (our internal Employee Engagement Platform) and website. We will continue to work 

towards our goal of strengthening our whistle-blowing policy. 

 

Throughout 2020 complaints could be reported to the AC either in person or by emailing 

whistleblow@boardroomlimited.com.  

 

If a complaint was received, the AC would: 

1. conduct its own investigation of the complaint; 

Where necessary, it can also instruct the internal auditor or other third parties to conduct further 

investigations. 

2. inform the reporting party of the likely timeline for a final response; 

3. recommend any remedial or legal action to be taken, where necessary;  

The remedial action can be carried out by instructing relevant management or engaging other third 

parties. If there is reason to believe that a crime has been committed, the AC may also report the 

matter to the authorities. 

4. notify the reporting party on actions which are taken; 

If no action is taken, the AC will also provide a reason for the decision. 

We have reviewed our process for whistleblowing and moving forward all complaints through the 

whistleblowing channel will be directed to the AC at G. K. Goh Holdings Limited.  


 7 

Our Non-Retaliation Policy 

 

We maintain a strict policy of non-retaliation, ensuring that parties are able to raise concerns through the 

whistle-blowing hotline confidentially and without fear of retaliation in any form. BoardRoom makes every effort 

to protect the identity of the reporting party and will investigate complaints alleging retaliatory action, such as 

disciplinary action against the reporting party. 

 

Our Complaints Handling Policy 

 

BoardRoom also has a separate Complaints Handling Policy targeted mainly at external stakeholders – such as 

vendors, clients and contractors – to lodge complaints against BoardRoom, its directors or personnel. The 

objective of the Policy is to provide guidance on the manner in which we receive and handle complaints and to 

assist us in resolving complaints in an efficient, effective and professional manner. 

 

Through both our Whistleblowing Policy and Complaints Handling Policy, we seek to maintain our reputation as 

a company delivering high quality professional services, committed to maintaining our responsiveness to the 

needs and concerns of our clients. 

 

Our Target 

Our Progress in 2020 

We plan to increase and improve channels to 

receive whistleblowing cases by 2021 

Ongoing progress: 

Updated the whistleblowing policy due to our delisting 

and the policy is up on our corporate page for 

transparency  

 

Our Approach to Risk Management 

 

Risk Management Policy 

 

We initiated a project to strengthen our Risk Management framework in 2020 through major changes on the 

company’s Risk Management Structure, Systems and People and Processes, from which we have updated the 

Risk Management Policy.  

 

The new policy adopts the COSO Enterprise Risk Management Framework (“COSO ERM”) and is guided by ISO 

ISO 31000:2018 (RM – Guidelines).   

 

The firm also formalised its Risk Management Structure with the appointment of Risk Owners in every Business 

Unit and Business Unit Enabler. As part of the new policy, a Risk Management system was implemented to 

manage the reporting of incidents and risks within the firm, and all incidents with an impact on the danger to 

the firm are required to be reported and are managed within the system.  

 

All Risk Owners were trained in FY20 on the updated Risk Management Policy and Framework as well as the use 

of the Risk Management System. We will continue to train new Risk Owners (if any) after they have been 

onboarded. As part of further strengthening Risk Management practices in BoardRoom, the firm will be 

reviewing its Enterprise Risk and Operational Risk in 2021/2022.  

 

Client Acceptance Policy &amp; Anti-Money Laundering Policy 

 

BoardRoom is committed to the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. As such, we 

have various policies in place to ensure compliance and guarding against any transaction which may facilitate 

money laundering and the financing of terrorism. We also conduct regular trainings to ensure employees are 

aware of BoardRoom’s commitments. The Group policy will be reviewed on a regular basis.  

 

Boardroom Employee Share Plan (“BESPL”), a subsidiary under BoardRoom, has its Anti-Money Laundering policy 

reviewed on a yearly basis to adhere to Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) regulations.  

In 2021, BoardRoom will review the Client Acceptance Policy, of which this will include the reviewing of the 

process flow for client onboarding and workflow to optimise the processes.  

 


 8 

Our Procurement Practices 

 

As a service company, we procure goods and services mainly to support our day-to-day operations, including 

office rental, mailing, postage, recruitment and other administrative support services. To ensure that the 

procurement process in the Company is fair, consistent and transparent, our procurement policy requires that 

we obtain at least three quotations from different suppliers before final selection either by management staff 

or the Board of Directors. Most of our service providers are sourced locally for cost effectiveness and based on 

our commitment to support local economies where we operate. Environmental, social or governance criteria 

may also be considered when making procurement decisions. 

 

Recognition from the Association of Banks in Singapore (“ABS”) for strong governance 

In recognition of our high standards of integrity and internal controls, BoardRoom was one of the first payroll 

service providers in Singapore to receive an Outsourced Service Provider Audit Report (“OSPAR”) certification 

for payroll services. BoardRoom received the certification after a rigorous audit process by Ernst &amp; Young, a 

testament to the integrity and effectiveness of our internal controls, backed by safeguards of the highest 

standards. The assessment covered issues such as protection of client information, strength of data security, 

as well as the integrity and confidentiality of our workflow, service and processes.  

 

Developed by the ABS, OSPAR ensures that outsourced service providers such as BoardRoom have the same 

level of governance, rigour and control as financial institutions. We are proud to be certified once again for 

the year of 2020 and will work towards getting recognised again for the year ahead.

Chapter 4: Our Approach to Sustainability 

 

As one of the regional leaders in Corporate and Advisory Services, we strive to demonstrate leadership in 

sustainability. In 2017, we took the first steps in our sustainability journey by publishing our very first 

sustainability report. In the same year, we also conducted a materiality assessment to help us focus on our most 

significant impacts, as well as set up a governance structure to manage our key environmental, social and 

governance issues. From employee engagement to reducing our operational footprint, we are on an incremental 

journey to embed sustainability into various aspects of our business. 

Our Sustainability Governance Structure 

 

 

 

 

Our Material Issues 

 

We define material issues as environmental, social and governance topics that have the largest influence on 

BoardRoom and our stakeholders. In 2017, we conducted our first materiality assessment to identify the 

sustainability issues to focus our efforts on. We undertook a three-stage process for the assessment: 

 

1. Desk-Based Research: Including a competitor benchmark and horizon scanning across our value chain; 

2. Stakeholder Engagement: Including internal interviews with departments and an online survey to 

engage external stakeholders; and  

3. Prioritising and Validation of Material Issues: A total of 14 sustainability issues were identified and 

ranked as high or low priority. 

This year, BoardRoom continues to report on our performance on the following 14 sustainability issues.

Embedding Digitalisation into Our Sustainability Strategy 

 

BoardRoom is going through an exciting period of digitalisation to enable us to secure long-term growth and 

maintain market leadership. At the same time, we have also harnessed the power of technology and 

digitalisation to help us with our sustainability performance. As such, we will be reporting on some of the new 

digital initiatives we have embedded into our sustainability strategy, which include: 

 

• 

product innovation: Expanding our digital product offerings for clients to better engage with their 

key stakeholders, such as investors, employees and clients; 

• 

strengthening cybersecurity: Utilising the latest technology to strengthen our defence against 

cyber threats; 

• 

upskilling our employees: Ensuring our employees are well-equipped with 21st century skills in 

areas such as Office Productivity, CRM and Virtualisation; 

• 

a more mobile workplace: Investing in cloud-based systems to create a virtual office, enabling our 

staff to increase productivity while improving work-life balance; 

• 

reducing paper usage: Rolling out of Project Paperless across our offices, our initiative to 

implement a digital record and document management system, in order to reduce our paper 

usage. In addition, we also rolled out new innovative products for our clients to reduce their paper 

usage; and  

• 

employee engagement: Our internal Fun @ BoardRoom team plans and organises internal events. 

The F@B team is made up of representatives from each department to give every department a 

fair say in the events organised.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Key: 

‘High’ priority:  Issues with high societal impact and concern to our stakeholders. They form the focus of 

our sustainability efforts and reporting. We will elaborate on our commitments and management practices 

on all of these issues in the chapters that follow. For each of the seven ‘high priority’ material issues 

identified, we have also set timely targets to track the continued improvement of our performance on these 

fronts. 

‘Low’ priority: Issues of relatively lesser importance, but still relevant to both BoardRoom and its 

stakeholders. We will actively manage and report on some of these issues as appropriate. 


 12 

Chapter 5: Clients 

 

As a service-provider, our clients are integral to our overall success. We strive to deliver quality service that is 

unparalleled, providing clients with solutions which are both innovative and practical. As such, our core strategy 

on client management is to forge strong and enduring relationships to help us retain our position as one of the 

top choices for companies in Asia-Pacific seeking corporate and advisory services. 

 

Our strategy to provide the best service for clients is based on the following focus areas: 

 

Product Innovation 

To better serve client needs, we continue to invest in product innovation and expand our digital product 

offerings. These new products deliver productivity benefits and help our clients better engage with key 

stakeholders, such as investors, employees and clients. Further differentiating BoardRoom from its peers as a 

provider of the latest cutting-edge products for corporate and advisory services. 

• 

AGM Landing Page We launched this in Australia in 2020 as a response to the demands of the Meeting 

Season in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The landing page collates all essential information and 

updates for shareholders into a single web page. This was an industry-first initiative addressing key 

client pain points that were further exaserbated by the pandemic such as timely communication with 

shareholders. The webpage houses key information such as: Annual Report, Notice of Meeting, Voting 

Instructions, Link to Online Voting and ability to submit questions.  

This new product builds on our continued success and commitment to product innovation since 2016, which 

include: 

• 

Digital platform for Payroll Services In 2019 we launched our all in one cloud-based Human Resource 

Management Solution (“HRMS”) solution, Ignite by BoardRoom (“Ignite”). Ignite streamlines clients 

HRMS needs by eliminating the need for multiple payroll systems, reducing administrative burden 

through automation and ultimately increases productivity by offering the convenience of a cloud-based 

system that supports access anywhere and anytime. Not only is the platform user-friendly it comes with 

a mobile application. The mobile application allows for instant access to payslips, claims and leave 

functions to ensure clients and their employees have access to the things that matter 24/7.  

• 

Digital platform for Employee Plan Services: We launched the latest addition to our suite of Employee 

Plan Services, EmployeeServe. This cutting-edge platform provides clients with real-time 24/7 access to 

their employee holdings, including transactions, balances, statements and advices, as well as the ability 

to instantly update personal information, accept employee plan offers, transact on vesting events, sell 

shares and view companies accounts. BoardRoom also provides end-to-end administrative services for 

clients to develop their own bespoke platform, starting from the design to the implementation phase. 

This new product enables clients to maximise participation rates and organisation productivity, while 

reducing company risk. 

• 

Innovative mobile investor relations platforms: We formed an exclusive alliance with Omni Market 

Tide, a market leader in digital engagement, to provide innovative mobile investor relations platforms 

to listed companies in Singapore and Hong Kong, laying the foundation for similar offerings in Taiwan, 

Indonesia, Malaysia, Japan and China. The applications include features to enhance the 

interconnectivity between companies and stakeholders, such as push communications, web streaming, 

shareholder voting, as well as access to company reports presentations and share price feeds. 

• 

Innovative application for securities registry market: We also launched an innovative application for 

the securities registry market in Australia. BoardRoom Digital Consolidated Application delivers a single 

online destination that combines smart technology with comprehensive real-time analytics, insights, 

news, statements, transactional and engagement features – benefiting clients, investors and employees 

by helping them to stay connected to the markets. 


 13 

We will continue to invest in research and development to enhance our product offering, striving to redefine 

how companies’ access, engage and transact with personal and market financial information. 

 

Client Privacy and Data Protection 

 

To maintain client privacy and data protection, BoardRoom adheres to a strict policy never to disclose and 

provide client information to third parties without prior consent. For example, when client data is accessed 

during audits, we hold a strict policy not to allow the copying of any confidential documents. At least one finance 

coordinator must also be present to ensure no misappropriation of information takes place during the process. 

 

Enhancing Data Protection 

 

To further reduce our privacy-related risks, we executed the following measures over 2020: 

• 

Formalised the Personal Data Protection (“PDP”) structure in 2020 with the official appointment of 

Data Protection Officers (“DPO”) and Data Protection Managers (“DPM”) in every Business Unit (“BU) 

and Business Unit Enabler (“BUE”).  All Business Units and Business Unit Enablers’ DPOs &amp; DPMs are 

members of Boardroom’s PDP Committee chaired by the Group DPO.  This committee meets every 

quarter with the goal of maintaining zero material breaches for another consective year. 

• 

Implemented a PDP platform “DPOinbox” to facilitate the management and documentation of all 

personal data related matters within Boardroom and its subsidiaries in Singapore.  This will be 

extended across the group if appropriate.   

• 

Initiated review of the firm’s PDP Framework and Policies, including the addition of new SOPs in 

order to strengthen its PDP  practices. These updates will be communicated and distributed to all staff 

in 2021 per the Group’s policies of reviews and updates every 2 years.   

• 

Kickstarted Application for Data Protection Trust Mark (“DPTM”), Boardroom Executive Services Pty 

Ltd applied for DPTM certification with IMDA in 2020.  The initiative is in final phases for assessment 

by IMDA-appointed assessors in early-2021 and is expected to obtain its certification 2021.  A 

successful DPTM certification by BESPL will be extended to the same initiative for BoardRoom 

Business Solutions in the latter half of 2021. These certifications will strengthen our management on 

personal data protection  across all clients and staff, and ensure stronger compliance to regulatory 

requirements on personal data protection. 

 

For FY20, there were no material personal data breaches within the Boardroom Group.  

 

 

Staff Training: 

We recognise the importance of continually equipping our staff with the necessary knowledge and skills to 

function as in-house data protection officers. As such, Straits Interactive (“SI”) also conducted training 

sessions with hands-on practice on the Straits’ Data Protection Management System (DPMS). The training 

session provided staff with a step-by-step approach to: 

- 

assess their personal data information assets; 

- 

conduct self-assessment for PDPA readiness; 

- 

perform an information security assessment and onsite audit; 

- 

monitor gaps and manage actions through an ongoing compliance dashboard; and 

- 

manage data breaches through an integrated response management system. 

 

 

 

Our Target 

Our Progress in 2020 

We are committed to maintaining zero cases of 

customer data privacy breaches 

Ongoing Progress 

No material breaches reported in FY20. Continued 

education of all staff to raise awareness and build a 

culture of DPO’s within BoardRoom.   


 14 

Strengthening Cybersecurity 

 

As a service provider trusted with confidential client information, we have put our focus on creating an 

ironclad infrastructure that will ensure we remain accountable to all stakeholders when it comes to data 

security. This includes the following steps we’ve taken in 2020:  

• 

Deployed Solarwinds N-Central as a suitable network and infra monitoring tool for regional sites 

• 

Enabled O365 Threat Protection which consists of rules for Ransomware, preventing Anti-phishing &amp; 

Anti-spoofing protection, 2FA implementation 

• 

Implemented Network Security Protection this limits user access such as cloud storage drives 

(Dropbox, Box, QQ etc.), USB port access (only read permission is granted), restricted user permission 

from installing software or enabling non-standard services 

• 

Remote Access Solution Standardisation TeamViewer remote access solution was implemented for 

Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and China 

• 

Executed Critical Business Applications &amp; Systems Monitoring UptimeRobot monitoring solution was 

put in place to monitor external facing business critical applications hosted on the cloud and data 

centre 

• 

Vulnerability Assessment &amp; Penetration Testing Review &amp; Remediation  

• 

Implemented Secure File Transfer Programme (for selected Business Units) 

• 

Cisco Umbrella Endpoint Client Deployment  

• 

Rolled out &amp; Achieved Certification for ISMS ISO27001 An internationally recognised specification 

and popular standard for an Information Security Management System and; 

• 

Conducted OSPAR FY 2019 Audit for Payroll Services Improving security handling in compliance with 

OSPAR. 

 

Staff Training: 

To ensure that our staff are also well-trained on cyber threats which they could potentially encounter in 

their line of work, we conducted two cyber security awareness trainings for Singapore based employees.  

 

 

Client Satisfaction 

 

BoardRoom has in place robust systems to track client satisfaction and will continue to develop our capabilities 

in this area. In all of our offices, BoardRoom’s team of client managers engage with clients on a frequent basis 

to maintain high client satisfaction. Many of our clients continue to renew their contracts with us and engage 

our services year after year. 

 

To more accurately measure client satisfaction, BoardRoom Australia has been using the Net Promoter Score 

(“NPS”), a management tool which measures the loyalty of customer relationships, adopted by more than two-

thirds of Fortune 1000 companies. Using NPS, we were able to identify clients which gave BoardRoom a lower 

score and work on managing these relationships in a more proactive manner. 

 

Plans to launch this were discussed and set in place in 2020, with the intention of implementing the NPS tool 

across our Asian offices, however, the outbreak of COVID-19 meant that there was a shift to focus on employee 

safety and health before all else and ensuring our Clients were fully supported irrespective of where our staff 

were working from. The rollout of NPS will be a focus for the business in 2021.  

 

Apart from NPS, we are exploring the use of technology to enable visibility over the full customer lifecycle, from 

onboarding through to termination to enhance our ability to track and retain clients.   

 

Our Target 

Our Progress in 2020 

Our target in 2020 was to accurately track and 

increase the number of retained clients by 

2020. However, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, 

we have postponed the timeline of the launch. 

We aim to achieve this by 2021. 

Ongoing progress: 

Due to COVID-19, we were unable to hit the target 

of implementing this in 2020. However, intend to roll 

it out in 2021.

Chapter 6: Employee Engagement 

 

At BoardRoom, we recognise that every member of the team brings a unique set of talents and skills to our 

business. We strive hard to be an employer of choice, committed to ensuring that every employee feels 

engaged, motivated and proud to be part of our team. To that end, we work hard to create a diverse and 

inclusive environment for our employees to enjoy personal and professional growth alongside the Company.

Diversity and Inclusion (Gender)  

 

The distribution of employees across the various age groups and gender is diverse as we focus on talent and 

ability regardless of gender or age. We will continue to scout for new talent whose employability will not lie 

within factors out of their control. With a significant proportion of our senior management being women, we 

would like to challenge the notion that there is a glass ceiling that is holding women back from being in upper 

management.

senior management.  

 

 

Talent Attraction, Development and Retention 

 

Employee Remuneration and Benefits 

 

To reward our employees for their service and contribution to the Company, BoardRoom is committed to 

providing the best we can for them, both in terms of remuneration or additional benefits. On top of adhering 

strictly to the basic terms and conditions of employment stipulated by national laws in our countries of operation 

(e.g. the Employment Act of Singapore), we also aim to provide remuneration above the minimum standards set 

by the government, benchmarking salaries to industry standards and expectations. 

 

In 2020, our comprehensive package includes insurance – covering medical, specialist, health and safety, 

outpatient, hospitalisation, personal accident, critical illness, dental, executive health screening and term life – 

as well as leave for sickness, bereavement, marriage, maternity, paternity, childcare, unpaid infant care, study 

and exams.

Performance Management 

 

To ensure that our employees receive timely feedback on their performance and support to chart out their 

professional growth, we have put in place a comprehensive employee appraisal and performance management 

system. 

 

In FY2018, we implemented a new appraisal system in all our offices apart from Australia. We continue to 

utilise the system which defines positive behavioural characteristics for the managers based on our values of 

having and being: 

• 

open: Communicating in a manner that is open and transparent; 

• 

collaborative: Working closely with partners to develop solutions that are smart, customer-centric and 

easy to use; 

• 

driven: Measuring performance by our success; 

• 

performance: Having a team of diverse and experienced professionals to ensure our solutions are 

current and compliant to ISO standards; 

• 

passion: Genuinely believing that what we do makes a difference; 

• 

long-lasting: Nurturing relationships and helping to grow our business for the long term; 

• 

pro-active: Taking initiative to make things happen and respond to market demands in a timely 

manner; and 

• 

partners: Having diverse networks and partnerships to help us work effectively and efficiently across 

various industries. 

 

The work of all employees is appraised on a continuous basis through formal appraisal reports prepared annually. 

Through these appraisals, we track the performance, progress, future potential and development needs of our 

employees and help them to improve their performance.

Recognising the importance of continuous learning, we have invested resources to provide employees with a 

series of courses and workshops to aid in their professional and personal growth. This includes external courses, 

in-house courses and on-the-job training.  

 

However, the unprecedented onset of the COVID-19 pandemic meant that planned physical courses had to be 

pushed back and it took some time to find alternatives which resulted in a lower than usual training hours in 

Singapore and Hong Kong due to the disruption.  

 

 

 

 

 

2 Our employees in Australia are covered by a comprehensive national health insurance by the government and our office in Australia does 

not provide additional benefits on top of this. 

3 Our employees in China receive social insurance and a housing fund from the government, amounting to CNY 45,709.39 (or 

SGD9114.97).  


 

18 

Highlights of our soft skills training courses include: 

• 

digital skills in areas such as Office Productivity, CRM and Virtualisation; 

• 

train the trainer programmes on effective presentations, upskilling them in areas such as facilitation; 

verbal and nonverbal presentation delivery techniques – content which our more senior employees 

can in turn incorporate into their presentation programmes for their team; and 

• 

psychometric profiling for managers to help them match profiles for their team.  

 

The turnout and feedback for these training programmes has been positive, leading to improvements in our 

internal operations and how we respond to client needs. We will continue to invest in upskilling our employees 

in the coming year.

The number of employees trained increased drastically across the Group, with a main factor being that the 

switch to virtual workshops enabled more employees to be included in trainings at the same time without the 

constraints of physical space. With its effectiveness, the HR team will consider keeping the implementation of 

virtual training in favour of on-site training.

Workplace Health, Safety and Well-Being (Employee Engagement) 

 

Flexible Work Arrangements 

As COVID-19 hit, many of our staff were already equipped for remote working and hence, there was little 

operational disruption to most of the company. As of the end of 2020, all teams apart from the minority who 

needed to be in office to perform administrative tasks, were able to work on a flexible basis. We are reviewing 

our current office leases and examining various options such as co-working spaces and hotdesking to enable 

employees the freedom to work whenever, wherever.  

 

Fun@BoardRoom Activities (Singapore) 

 

In 2020, the focus shifted from physical gatherings to how we could continue to engage with our employees 

whilst ensuring their safety during the pandemic. Hence, there was an increase in virtual activities, which also 

created opportunities for the different countries to participate in the same event together (e.g. the World 

Origami Day contest).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lunar New Year Lunch  

 

31 January 2020: One of the last physical gatherings 

before COVID-19 restrictions, BoardRoom Singapore 

staff were treated to a fun-filled buffet lunch at 

CulinaryOn, complete with exciting events such as a 

Lunar New Year Trivia quiz via Kahoot! ending with the 

traditional raw salad tossing (“Lau Yu Sheng”) to usher 

in good luck.  

 

A customary BoardRoom practice, this lunch was aimed 

at bringing our staff together and rewarding all for their 

hard work over the year.  

 

 

 

 

Christmas Virtual Terrarium Workshop 

 

18 December 2020: In a fun and simple tutorial, 

30 lucky participants from the Singapore team 

were provided materials to build their own 

terrarium. They then attended a virtual 

terrarium workshop where they followed step-

by-step instructions to build their own Christmas 

themed terrarium.  

 

This encouraged staff to showcase their 

creativity and bond with their colleagues 

through this stress-relieving activity.

Fun@BoardRoom Activities (Malaysia) 

 

While many engaging activities such as the Office Fitness Classes were planned to run on a regular basis, the 

safety and health of our staff meant that we had to temporarily put these on hold during the COVID-19 

pandemic. However, the team in Malaysia adapted quickly by hosting several employee appreciation events 

where they gave tokens of gratitude to the staff to acknowledge their hard work during this difficult time.  

 

 

 

 

Office Fitness Class 

 

January – March 2020: From rigorous Circuit Training 

classes to relaxing Yoga sessions, staff from BoardRoom 

Malaysia joined group exercises held in the office to 

encourage and motivate everyone to remain fit and 

healthy whilst also relieving stress.  

 

 

Lunar New Year Decoration Class 

 

22 January 2020: Staff were invited to join a 

Lunar New Year decoration class to learn how to 

create festive ornaments. This helped to 

increase bonding and encourage teamwork.

Fun@BoardRoom Activities (Hong Kong) 

 

Despite the challenging year that Hong Kong faced in 2020, the F@B team did a great job overcoming the 

obstacles of social distancing to organise fun activities such as the DIY Mooncake Class. As the Mid-Autumn 

festival has a core meaning of “reunion” in Chinese culture, this activity was significant as it marked the slow 

but safe return of our staff to the office in Hong Kong.

Employee Engagement Activities (China) 

 

The small but close team in China saw an opportunity, when the COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, to gather 

physically in office for a team bonding session to celebrate the end of an unexpected year.  

 

 

 

X’mas Excitement Lunch 

 

23 Dec 2020: The BoardRoom China team took a breather as they rang in the end of the year with a nice 

get-together. It was a reward for their dedication to BoardRoom as they enjoyed pizza while bonding with 

each other.   

 

 

Employee Engagement Activities (Australia)  

 

The Australian team celebrated their return to office following the end of lockdown with interesting and quirky 

costumes for Halloween.  

 

 

 

Halloween Best Dressed Contest 

 

2 Nov 2020: In the spirit of Halloween, our colleagues in Australia dressed up in elaborate and fun costumes 

to celebrate the end of lockdown as they returned to the office. Colleagues then voted for their favourite 

costumes.

Chapter 7: Environmental Management 

 

As a professional services company, BoardRoom recognises that the greatest opportunities to lower our 

environmental footprint lie within the locations where our employees operate. As such, our environmental 

strategy is focused on ensuring we are as resource efficient as possible. 

 

While initial plans for 2020 were to begin working on Malaysia, we were unable to carry it out due to COVID-19 

restrictions. Only 10% of our employees were allowed in the Malaysia offices at any one time which greatly 

hindered the progress of the project. However, we fully intend to resume it once we are able to get more staff 

into office.  

 

Reducing Paper Usage 

 

Traditionally, due to the nature of being a corporate services business, the use of paper 

has been a staple of our standard operations. However, as digitalisation became more 

commonplace, we realised that a reliance on physical documents had landlocked our 

operations and was holding us back. Hence, to give our operations teams flexibility 

whilst reducing our carbon footprint through a reduction of paper usage, our first 

paperless initiative was kickstarted back in 2017. In 2018, Project Charter: Transitioned 

to Paperless, Cloud-Based Systems picked up where the first initiative left off and in 2019, we merged this into 

Project Paperless. In 2020, we completed the implementation of Project Paperless in Singapore, with plans for 

the rollout across the rest of the Group which were affected by the COVID-19 outbreak as staff were unable to 

perform the tasks required remotely.  

 

It is important to note that for the paper we still use, we obtain from sources recognised by the Programme for 

the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC).

Switch to Digital rather than Physical Business Cards 

 

Pre COVID-19, we had rolled out a plan to introduce digital business cards in place of paper cards. This 

innovative idea not only reduced paper consumption but also ensured that we could efficiently produce 

business cards in a shorter period of time. In 2020, all managers and above in Singapore, Malaysia &amp; Hong 

Kong offices received a digital business card and physical cards were only available on special request.  

 

Product Innovation to Reduce Paper Usage by Clients 

 

We have also been developing innovative new products to help our clients reduce their paper usage. We will 

continue to look for similar opportunities through product innovation. 

 

Reducing Need for Travel 

 

Transition to Virtual Meeting Platforms 

 

To reduce the need for travel, we have also implemented systems for our employees to communicate virtually, 

such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Due to COVID-19, a large part of our meetings are now held virtually rather 

than physically, saving the consumption of fuel or energy on travel.  

 

Reducing Energy Consumption and Efficiency 

 

A significant challenge faced by BoardRoom is that we do not own the buildings in which we operate. This limits 

our ability to control certain operational aspects such as the thermostat for the air-conditioning units, the type 

of light bulbs used and the amount of discharge by taps in toilets used. 

 

Due to COVID-19 requirements across the Group in their respective countries, most of the energy consumption 

fell as staff worked remotely rather than in office. While we’re not able to track usage of energy in our staffs’ 

personal space, we do intend to continue with promoting flexible working to reduce the consumption of 

electricity in the office buildings.

Chapter 8: Community Investment 

 

We continue to value the voice of all employees, and one platform from which they can voice their opinions is 

through the Fun@BoardRoom teams in each country. This means that our Corporate Social Responsibility 

activities stem from the heart of the employees, who embody our core values. Through this, we have been 

heartened to see their involvement and we do our part by supporting them in their endeavours, be it through 

monetary matching of donations or providing the resources from which they can conduct their activities.  

Key Highlights: 

Singapore  

Fundraising 

 

2020 was a tough year for everyone, especially the 

less fortunate. The Singapore Fun@BoardRoom 

team organised a Virtual Charity Drive for Make A 

Wish Foundation, a charity that grants the wishes of 

seriously ill children.  

 

With an original goal of S$1,000, our employees’ 

generous contributions resulted in the final 

fundraising of S$2,770 in total. The company 

matched the generous donations, rounding up to a 

total of S$6,000 that was donated to the charity.   

 

We continue to ensure that the company 

encourages and empowers staff to contribute what 

they can to the less fortunate.  

 

 

 

 

 

Malaysia 

Fundraising &amp; Staff Volunteering 

 

Staff from the BoardRoom Malaysia team, including 

management, volunteered at the Pusat Sama-Sama 

Orphanage where they supported the wellbeing of 

the children in need to provide them with guidance 

and hope.  

 

Volunteers from BoardRoom, led by Samantha, 

spent a meaningful Sunday afternoon at Pusat 

Sama-Sama. 

 

Pusat Sama-Sama is a non-profit organisation which 

provides various free educational guidance and 

mentorship for less privileged children to acquire 

basic literacy and numeracy skills.
