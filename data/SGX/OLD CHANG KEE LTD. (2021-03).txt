BOARD STATEMENT 

 

BOARD STATEMENT 

We are pleased to present Old Chang Kee Ltd.’s (“Old Chang Kee”) annual Sustainability Report for 

our financial year ended 31 March 2021 (“FY2021”). 

 

The key material economic, environmental, social and governance (“EESG”) factors for Old Chang Kee 

have been identified and reviewed by the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). The board 

of directors of Old Chang Kee (“Board”) oversees the management and monitoring of these factors and 

takes them into consideration in the determination of the company’s strategic direction and policies. 

Sustainability is a part of Old Chang Kee’s wider strategy to create long-term value for all our 

stakeholders. 

 

With the availability of economic, environment, social and governance data, sustainability reporting has 

gained greater significance to investors. Far from being just an image building exercise, today, it is 

widely accepted that good EESG practices contribute to the overall long-term success of the company 

and play an important part in the competition for talent and investment. 

 

Businesses must be quick to adapt to key stakeholders’ concerns, closing any potential gaps and 

capitalising on opportunities amid today’s rapidly-changing business environment.  

 

In defining our reporting content, we applied the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”)’s principles by 

considering the Group’s activities, impact and substantive expectations and interests of its 

stakeholders. We observed a total of four principles, namely, materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, 

sustainability index and completeness. For reporting quality, we observed the principles of balance, 

comparability, accuracy, timeliness, clarity and reliability.  

 

The EESG data and information provided have been derived from internal data monitoring and 

verification to ensure accuracy.  

 

REPORTING PERIOD AND SCOPE 

This Sustainability Report is set out on a “comply or explain” basis in accordance with Catalist Rule 

711B and Practice Note 7F of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd. (“SGX-ST”) Listing 

Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist. Corresponding to GRI’s emphasis on materiality, the report 

highlights the key economic, environmental, social and governance related initiatives carried out by the 

Company and its significant subsidiaries throughout the 12-month period, from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 

2021.  

 

REPORTING FRAMEWORK 

Old Chang Kee has chosen the GRI framework as it is the most established international sustainability 

reporting standard and in respect of the extent to which such framework is applied, this Sustainability 

Report has been prepared with reference to the GRI Standards reporting guidelines, at Core level.

Old Chang Kee Ltd. 

Sustainability Report 2021 

 

CORPORATE PROFILE 

 

 

The history of Old Chang Kee goes as far back as 1956 when it started with just a small stall in a coffee 

shop outside the former Rex cinema along McKenzie Road. People just loved the delicious pastry 

stuffed full of curried potatoes, chicken, a slice of egg, fried with several herbs and spices. Each curry 

puff was carefully handmade and properly sealed to lock in the unmistakable aroma that won the hearts 

of many Singaporeans. 

 

In 1986, Han Keen Juan made a pivotal decision that was to change his life as well as the food scene 

in Singapore. He traded a comfortable job with an established MNC for the hot and greasy kitchen of 

Old Chang Kee. With whatever savings he had, he bought over the control of the company. Facing an 

uncertain future ahead of him, he had only one goal in mind - to transform Old Chang Kee into a 

successful business entity. 

 

Strategic Move 

 

Han quickly set about modernizing and re-engineering the business. He implemented new systems and 

took critical steps to ensure quality standards. He launched an aggressive programme to grow Old 

Chang Kee to become Singapore's leading brand of curry puffs and other hot savories. His hard work 

paid off, for in 1992, he was awarded Entrepreneur of the Year and was hailed by Newsweek and the 

now defunct Asia Magazine as the man to watch. 

 

In his true entrepreneurial spirit, he took another big gamble by investing in a 20,000 square feet modern 

factory in Woodlands. Back then he was producing his curry puffs from a small corner of the coffee 

shop and later moved to a slightly bigger premise in a flatted factory in Ubi. But he knew that in order 

to bring the company into the big league, he had to keep upgrading and hence his move to Woodlands. 

With the move to bigger, modern premises came bigger challenges for him. He had to change the 

mindset of his people. He had to convince them that the modern machineries and modern processes 

were not designed to replace them but rather to standardize the work flow and to ensure stringent 

quality control. 

 

Old Chang Kee markets its curry puffs through various concepts - from kiosks along the road, to 

supermarket outlets and to modern shopping malls. With one of the best curry puffs around and 

achieving high marks in accessibility, variety and wholesome goodness, Old Chang Kee has also 

diversified and extended its product range to include other snacks, desserts and complementary 

products such as spring rolls, sotong balls, fish balls, crab claws, sesame balls and sotong fritters etc, 

all produced with the same high quality standards that go into making its classic curry puff.

Our New Leader 

 

After bringing Old Chang Kee to its height, Han soon realized that it was time to groom a new leader. 

He needed a strong visionary leader to bring the company to the next level and so in 1995, he brought 

in William Lim Tao-E, a young graduate of an Australian university. He brought with him fresh ideas and 

applied innovative marketing strategies to keep in sync with shifting consumer trends. 

 

As Managing Director then, William Lim, together with Chairman, Han Keen Juan, embarked on the 

next stage of the journey, which was to establish Old Chang Kee as a major recognisable brand in 

modern Singapore while preserving its valuable heritage. 

 

We Are Halal 

 

In 2004, Old Chang Kee set on to fulfill one of its brand values which was to develop products that 

would appeal to the multi-cultural and multi-religious segment of society. We drew our inspiration from 

the various spicy finger foods from different ethnic cultures. In January 2005, we achieved "Halal" 

certification to reach out to the Muslim community. 

 

The 'Old Chang Kee' Brand 

 

Today, we are delighted that Old Chang Kee brand has become a household name. Our painstaking 

efforts to achieve top of mind awareness among Singaporeans has paid off handsomely. In 2004 and 

2005, Old Chang Kee was awarded the Singapore Promising Brand Award and also the Singapore 

Heritage Brand Award. 

 

Our Brands 

 

Each brand name embodies the unique promise, aspiration and personality of the product. In order to 

differentiate the product from others in today's competitive market, Old Chang Kee has developed 

memorable and distinctive brand names for all our products, including Old Chang Kee, Curry Times, 

Bun Times, Mushroom Cafe, O’My Kampong, O’ My Darling and Dip ‘N’ Go.   

 

Brand Mission 

 

Our mission is to deliver superior quality hot finger food and ready meals at a value-for money price 

positioning; in a clean and customer-friendly retail environment. 

 

The Old Chang Kee brand aims to fulfill the following promises 

 

 

To deliver consistently a wide variety of high quality hot finger food and ready meals through 

standardised food preparation processes. 

 

To refine and modernise traditional food recipes for the modern, multi-cultural customers. 

 

To provide an alternative to fast food for the busy and mobile city dwellers.

STAKEHOLDERS ENGAGEMENT  

An important starting point in our sustainability journey is to identify our stakeholders and material 

aspects relevant to our business. The interests and requirements of key stakeholders are also taken 

into account when formulating corporate strategies. These key stakeholders include, but are not limited 

to, customers, suppliers, shareholders, employees, and regulators. We adopt both formal and informal 

channels of communication to understand the needs of key stakeholders, and incorporate these into 

our corporate strategies to achieve mutually beneficial relationships.  

 

The impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“Covid-19”) on businesses in general has been 

unprecedented. In these highly unusual times, similar to the financial year ended 31 March 2020 

(“FY2020”), we have continued to consider and take into account the impact of Covid-19 on key 

stakeholder groups such as our employees, customers, suppliers and the community.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT  

Our sustainability process begins with the identification of relevant aspects. Relevant aspects are then 

prioritised to identify material factors which are subject to validation. The end result of this process is 

a list of material factors disclosed in the Sustainability Report. 

 

 

The Group has conducted a materiality assessment during the year. We engaged our employees from 

different departments, seeking our internal stakeholders’ feedback for prioritisation of these topics. 

Going forward, materiality reviews will be conducted every year, incorporating inputs gathered from 

stakeholders’ engagements. 

 

In order to determine if an aspect is material, we assessed its potential impact on the economy, 

environment and society and its influence on the stakeholders. Applying the guidance from GRI, we 

have identified the following as our material aspects. The Company has reviewed and concluded that 

the EESG factors for FY2021 are similar to the factors reported on for FY2020.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

Old Chang Kee is committed to grow our customers, exceed our customers’ expectations and provide

The Group’s revenue decreased by approximately S$12.7 million or 14.4% for FY2021. 

 

The Group’s gross profit margin improved by 1.9% in FY2021, mainly due to economics of scale from 

the large-scale catering of packed meals to foreign workers dormitories, improved food cost controls 

and higher production staff efficiency.

ANTI CORRUPTION 

Old Chang Kee does not tolerate corruption in any form. The Company has in place a whistle-blowing

as the Company’s business associates may, in confidence, raise any concerns about possible 

improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters to the Management and/or the Audit

ENVIRONMENTAL  

 

MATERIALS 

 

Palm Oil 

Meeting our consumers’ needs, having creative and innovative products, improving the quality of our 

products and being socially responsible are our key business goals. 

 

Many years back, we took the initiative to use Healthier Oil which was and continues to be endorsed by 

the Health Promotion Board (“HPB”), as reflected by the Healthier Choice Symbol. Then, we conducted 

extensive trials to ensure that using healthier oil does not compromise on our food quality and taste. 

 

Similarly, for the sustainable oil option, we qualify our cooking oil suppliers to ensure that their cooking 

oil can meet both (i) the Healthier Oil endorsement by HPB and (ii) the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm 

Oil (“RSPO”) certification on sustainable cooking oil. 

 

Despite the many challenges and limitations, our promise to consumers is that we will continue to 

source for healthier and socially responsible cooking oil, without compromising on the food quality and 

taste. 

 

Sustainable palm oil production comprises legal, economically viable, environmentally appropriate and 

socially beneficial management and operations. At the heart of RSPO certification are the RSPO 

Principles and Criteria for Sustainable Palm Oil Production (including Indicators and Guidance, revised 

November 2013), the global guidelines for producing palm oil sustainably. 

 

Prior to July 2018, we were using palm oil from suppliers with 

sustainability certifications, but our particular house brand from the 

supplier was not certified yet. As part of our sustainability initiatives, we 

commenced preparation works for RSPO Supply Chain Certification in 

July 2018, and were successfully audited on 12 &amp; 13 December 2018. 

The palm oil used in frying our products are officially RSPO certified by 

Bureau Veritas with effect from 12 March 2019, and are subject to annual 

audits to maintain the RSPO certification status. For the current financial 

year under review, the audit had been completed successfully from 23 to 

24 November 2020. 

 

In FY2021, our total cooking oil consumption was approximately 799,305 kg or S$1,199,142 as 

compared to 946,635 kg or S$1,357,000 in FY2020.  

 

Packaging Materials 

We use reusable packaging materials including our paper bags, and our biodegradable carrier bags. 

The percentage of our suppliers using Environmental Packaging in FY2021 is 57% (FY2020: 54%) of 

our total packaging suppliers. The total cost of packaging materials amounted to S$1,450,751 in 

FY2021 (FY2020: S$1,333,000).  

 

Our target is to maintain our RSPO Supply Chain Certification for our palm oil used in production, and 

to maintain or increase the percentage of our suppliers using Environmental Packaging.

Old Chang Kee Ltd.

ENERGY 

Old Chang Kee is fully aware of its responsibility for nurturing the environment and lessening negative 

environmental consequences at our worksites and the environment where we operate. We monitor our 

electricity consumption at our work places to ensure that we use our resources economically, 

meaningfully and responsibly. Our individual heads of departments examine our bills in detail monthly 

and significant variances from the previous months are flagged for follow-up action.  Outlet supervisors 

and managers’ monthly incentive systems are also structured to reward them with, among others, any 

savings from energy consumption. Property and Maintenance Department would also change older 

machines for newer, more energy efficient machines, where appropriate.  

 

In FY2021, our electricity consumption was recorded at 7,993,960 kwh (FY2020: 8,860,475 kwh). The 

decrease was mainly due to lower equipment utilisation rates for our factories and outlets, as a result 

of lower retail sales in FY2021. For FY2021, our electricity consumption was 61 kwh per square foot 

(FY2020: 68 kwh per square foot). Our target is to maintain or lower our electricity consumption (kwh) 

per square foot in FY2022.  

 

EFFLUENTS AND WASTE 

 

Oil Waste Management 

We are environmentally friendly and dispose of our used cooking oil via accredited used oil collectors, 

so that it can be treated before being responsibly recycled. Our initiatives to reduce the volume of oil 

waste included enhanced staff training on oil waste procedures, and working with cooking oil suppliers 

to improve the durability of cooking oil. The volume of oil waste managed through accredited oil 

collectors amounted to approximately 235,269 litres in FY2021 (FY2020: 258,818 litres). All of the 

cooking oil used by the Company and its significant subsidiaries are collected by accredited collectors.  

 

We will continue to use accredited collectors and ensure that 100% of our used cooking oils for the 

Company and its significant subsidiaries are treated by accredited collectors before being recycled.   

 

SUPPLIER ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 

Given the sizeable quantity of packing materials used in our business, Management has launched 

various sustainability initiatives, such as requiring our major packaging suppliers to have environmental 

certifications and to use biodegradable carrier bags. The 4 main suppliers with environmental 

certifications during FY2021 are Cheng Moh Huat Pte Ltd, Premier Packaging Pte Ltd, Techpak (Asia) 

Pte Ltd and EcoGreen Packaging Pte Ltd. The percentage of our suppliers using environmental 

packaging in FY2021 is 57% (FY2020: 54%) of our total packaging suppliers. During FY2021, there 

were no new major packaging suppliers. 

 

We also require our main cooking oil suppliers to have globally recognised sustainability certifications 

(i.e. RSPO certifications). Our main supplier during FY2021 was Ngo Chew Hong Edible Oil Pte Ltd, 

who supplies us with “RSPO MB Healthier Choice Cooking Oil” under our Old Chang Kee house-brand. 

 

Our target is to ensure that our main suppliers for packaging materials and cooking oil continue to have 

sustainability certifications, in view of the significant quantities used in our business.  

 

In response to any potential Covid-19 lockdowns, the Group has also reviewed the resilience of key 

supplier networks for packaging materials and cooking oil, including alternative suppliers with 

operations both in Singapore and overseas. The Group is satisfied that its network of key suppliers, 

including alternative suppliers, remain resilient and are able to maintain the supply of key materials in 

event of any Covid-19 lockdowns.

We are committed to provide equal opportunities for existing employees and new candidates to maintain 

a diverse and robust workforce. Assuming that the public health situation in Singapore permits, we aim 

to hold at least 3 activities or events each year for our employees.

information on the latest safe management measures to our office, production and outlet workers, as 

and when necessary, and ensuring that these measures are being carried out at all times. He is also 

responsible for liaising with the authorities’ safe distancing officers to improve on any safe management 

measures at our factory and outlets. 

 

These measures include, among others, separate staff access, isolation room and evacuation routes 

for sick employees at our factory, staggering operations into split teams with different timings, physical 

markings to ensure social distancing, ensuring the availability of face masks and sanitisers to our 

employees, implementation of SafeEntry at our factory and outlets, visitor management plan, and 

regular sanitisation and disinfection procedures for key touchpoints.

CUSTOMER HEALTH AND SAFETY 

We ensure clean and quality products are served to our customers. We have external contractors who 

regularly clean and sanitise our factory and outlets, perform equipment servicing, as well as contractors 

for pest control. We have increased the frequency of our cleaning and sanitization processes, in 

response to the threat from Covid-19.  

 

Our factory staff conduct daily checks on cleanliness and safety, using the self-inspection checklist. The 

daily checklist would be filed, and periodically checked by the supervisors for compliance.

For FY2021, we continued to engage a consultant to assist in our Halal accreditation process which 

involves disposing of all items which are not halal-compliant from our premises, carrying out 'sertu' or 

ritual cleansing of the production line, central kitchens and outlet, as well as undergoing halal training 

courses. All of the above points illustrated Old Chang Kee's commitment towards the Halal process.

We will continue to ensure our customer’s health and safety and ensure that there are no non-

compliance with regulations. We will also ensure that we continue to be Halal-certified.  

 

To counter the threat of Covid-19, the SMO is responsible for implementing safe distancing measures 

at our retail outlets. He is also responsible for liaising with the authorities’ safe distancing officers to 

improve on any safe management measures at our retail outlets. 

 

These measures include, among others, physical markings to ensure social distancing, ensuring the 

availability of face masks and sanitisers to our employees and customers, implementation of SafeEntry 

at our outlets, customer queue management system, and regular sanitisation and disinfection 

procedures for key touchpoints.

GOVERNANCE 

 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

The Board and the Management of Old Chang Kee are committed to the best practices in corporate 

governance to ensure sustainability of the Group’s operations. We believe that our constant drive for 

corporate excellence will allow us to establish a more transparent, accountable and equitable system, 

thereby increasing the value of the Company and its value to our shareholders. Please refer to the 

Annual Report 2021 pages 20 to 68 for details of the Group’s Corporate Governance Report. Going 

forward, we will continue to comply with the Code of Corporate Governance 2018, its related practice 

guidance and meet all requirements that are expected of us by our stakeholders. 

 

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  

The Directors recognise that they have overall responsibility to ensure proper financial reporting for the 

Group and effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls, including financial, operational, 

compliance and IT controls, and risk management policies and systems. The Audit Committee assists 

the Board in providing oversight of risk management in the Company.  

 

The Company has in place an Enterprise Risk Management Framework. The implementation and 

maintenance of the Company’s risk management framework is undertaken by the senior management 

team, which reports to the Audit Committee on strategic business risks as well as provides updates on 

the risk management activities of the Company’s businesses and the Enterprise Risk Management 

implementation progress of the Company. Significant strategic risks identified are assessed, managed 

and monitored adequately within the Company’s risk management framework. These strategic risks are 

also reviewed and refreshed to ensure relevant emerging risks are being considered and included for 

proper assessment, monitoring and reporting as appropriate. 

 

The Group continually reviews and improves its business and operational activities to identify areas of 

significant business risk as well as takes appropriate measures to control and mitigate these risks. 

These include the implementation of safety, security and internal control measures and taking up 

appropriate insurance coverage. The Group’s financial risk management programme seeks to minimise 

potential adverse effects of the unpredictability of financial markets on the Group’s financial 

performance. We will regularly review the Enterprise Risk Management policies to ensure that all 

relevant risks are identified, communicated and addressed in a timely manner. 

 

BUSINESS ETHICS 

All of our staff are reminded of the importance of upholding the highest standards when it comes to 

business ethics. The Group regularly updates relevant staff with development in international and local 

regulations. Similar to FY2020, there were no significant fines or non-monetary sanctions for non-

compliance with laws and regulations reported in FY2021. There have also been no reported incidents 

of corruption during the reporting period. Our target is to ensure all allegations received are promptly 

addressed and to maintain zero incidents of non-compliance.    

 

EXTERNAL ASSURANCES 

The Company did not seek external assurances for FY2021, as there were no significant changes to 

GRI Standards from the previous years. We may seek external assurances in the future, should GRI 

Standards be substantially modified.
