SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

In 2015, all 193 member states of the United Nations (including Singapore) 

adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The 17 SDGs set out a 

path to ‘end extreme poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and protect our planet’ 

by 2030. The private sector will play an important role in delivering the SDGs, 

through doing business responsibly, innovation and collaboration. We align our 

sustainability efforts to the following SDGs.

We are dedicated towards incorporating innovative design and quality 

excellence in the buildings we develop. We promote sustainable 

practices across our businesses. 

• We are one of the early adopters of PPVC2 and advocates for BIM3 

in our developments.

Avenue, will set a new world record for the tallest reinforced concrete 

structure for residential development using the PPVC method.

We actively consider sustainable design in all our properties. We 

explore ways to preserve the environment’s inherent character and 

cultural heritage wherever we operate.

We engage our key stakeholders on sustainable consumption and 

production to positively impact the construction and hospitality industry 

value chain.

• For property development, all our main contractors are OHSAS 

18001 and ISO 14001 certified.

We are committed to combating climate change and its impact by 

regulating our GHG emissions through the reduction of energy and 

water usage.

hospitality industries, government, regulators and our suppliers 

including main contractors, to promote sustainable practices.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE STATEMENT

Dear Stakeholders

The government has recently unveiled key plans in creating a more sustainable, 

inclusive and green city with community spaces for all to enjoy under the Draft 

Master Plan 2019. Besides rejuvenating familiar places, there will be a focus 

on creating capacity for the future. Part of this vision is the push towards a 

car-lite nation.

As a leading property developer, UOL plays a crucial role in supporting the 

rejuvenation of Singapore, while considering the different passions of our 

communities, the impact on the environment and our contributions to the economy 

when we manage our business operations. For this report, we have chosen the 

theme “Craving Communities” to reflect our continued drive towards a more 

inclusive and sustainable city.  

SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE IN 2018

Singapore designated 2018 as the Year of Climate Action. We are pleased 

that our commercial properties and hospitality business achieved some of our 

environmental targets in 2018. 

During the year, our commercial properties achieved an 18.8% reduction in 

building energy intensity by GFA occupied, compared with the base year of 2010. 

For reduction in water intensity by GFA occupied, our commercial properties 

achieved and exceeded their target of 10% by 2020 with a 24.1% reduction in 

2018 compared with the base year of 2010.

Our hospitality business is on track towards meeting the target of 27% reduction 

in energy intensity by guest night by 2020 compared with the base year of 

2013, having achieved a 26.3% reduction in 2018. Our hospitality business also 

achieved a 29.8% reduction in water intensity by guest night in 2018, compared 

with the base year of 2013, exceeding our target of 25% reduction by 2020.

As most of our development projects are in their peak construction stages, we 

recorded an increase of 67.6% in GHG emissions intensity by value of work 

completed and an increase of 65.6% of water intensity by value of work completed 

year-on-year. 

During the year, we recorded an accident frequency rate of 0.8, a slight increase 

from 2017 but below the national industry average of 1.5. We will continue to 

work towards a workplace with zero incidences, maintaining focus on high 

occupational safety standards and engaging our contractors.

COMMITMENT TO GREEN DEVELOPMENTS AND 

INCLUSIVE SPACES

We are committed to green design. The Tre Ver is a 729-unit condominium 

facing the Kallang River and built into the surrounding landscape. Pan Pacific Orchard 

is a new-built green 350-key hotel featuring three unique levels of experiential 

sky gardens that will redefine the vertical sky-rise typology. A built design that 

integrates nature has a positive impact on residents and guests. 

Our properties provide spaces for people to come together to work and live a 

healthy lifestyle. In 2018, we rebranded our mall located in Paya Lebar as KINEX. 

The mall now offers experiential appeal and community-centric activities such as 

free workshops and performances to inject life into the area, which is earmarked 

as one of the commercial hubs to be developed outside the city centre.

We also support social inclusion through our various corporate social responsibility 

initiatives with partners like Very Special Arts Singapore.

A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE FOR EVERYONE

Supporting and caring for our community is part of our culture and we will continue 

to devote resources in this area. We are pleased to see continued commitment 

amongst our employees in volunteering their time to engage the underprivileged 

through the activities that we organised for our community partners.

Our employees have always been at the core of our business success. It is our 

responsibility to create a conducive, fair and respectful workplace for our employees 

to feel valued at work. We also embrace diversity and individual differences 

to bring forth broader and more enriching perspectives to the workplace.

At UOL, we believe the journey towards sustainability and the management of 

environmental, social and governance issues will help foster innovation, make 

us more resilient and build value for all our stakeholders. We look forward to 

your continuous support as we strive towards a sustainable business for current 

and future generations.

Closer to Nature

Driven by our passion and commitment to deliver 

quality products and services to our stakeholders, 

we proactively integrate innovation and 

creativity into the buildings we develop, adopt 

sustainable practices and manage our operations 

in a customer-focused, resource-efficient manner. 

For our property development, we continue to 

employ innovative technologies such as PPVC. 

Our second PPVC project is Avenue South 

Residence, a 56-storey twin towers at Silat 

Avenue that will set a new world record for 

tallest reinforced concrete PPVC residential 

development. This will surpass our own record 

for The Clement Canopy that was completed in 

March 2019. We also adopted biophilic design 

by incorporating green elements into buildings, 

to support a natural and sustainable living 

environment. (See case study on page 17.)

For our hospitality business, we closely monitor 

in-house guest satisfaction surveys, and external 

reviews on multiple platforms. We continue to 

benchmark our performance via an external 

Quality Assurance specialist. Employee 

development and training is a key factor in the 

provision of service excellence in hospitality 

business. Please refer to the People Development 

section for our initiatives on enhancing service 

quality.

True to the concept of biophilic design, the development is built into the surrounding 

natural landscape, with sky terraces for all nine towers and airy living spaces in all 

units, including green foyers for some residential units. Twelve existing mature 

raintrees along the river were conserved and integrated with a 200m-long  

recreational deck within the development. A variety of other amenities are set against 

the landscaped terraces and water cascades, under the continuous raintree canopy.

The orientation and configuration of the residential blocks are designed to maximise 

space, which enhances the natural lighting and cross-ventilation of the whole 

development. Designed by award-winning  WOHA  Architects, “breathing architecture” 

is integrated within the development, giving residents a good feeling that they are 

connecting with nature.

By incorporating these design considerations, The Tre Ver provides a high-rise natural 

home amidst the humid tropical climate of Singapore.



The Tre Ver’s (artist’s impression) biophilic design can improve the health and well-being of its residents.



REBRANDED MALL TO INJECT MORE 

EXPERIENTIAL APPEAL AND COMMUNITY 

ACTIVITIES 

To keep up with the changing retail landscape, OneKM in Paya Lebar was rebranded 

to KINEX to become an experiential and community-centric mall that promotes social 

activities and interactions in August 2018.

KINEX’s new tagline, “Let’s Play”, encompasses a variety of lifestyle and community-

based facilities, activities and events. A major attraction of KINEX will be the first-of-

its-kind indoor retail theme park operated by Invade Industry, the company behind 

co-making space MOX. It offers a wide range of interesting, independent lifestyle 

brands, trendy workshops, events and a café. The mall also features a permanent 

pop-up retail concept where products and services are updated regularly. The Green 

Collective SG, Singapore’s first green lifestyle concept store, also opened at KINEX, 

offering eco-friendly products and services as well as experiential workshops.

Ms Jesline Goh, Chief Investment and Asset Officer, said: “The retail landscape is 

changing and as a mall owner, we continually look at ways to redefine and rethink 

the shopper experience to stay relevant. With e-commerce and social media, retail 

spaces need to evolve to bring about unique experiences that consumers cannot 

find online. KINEX – a combination of kinetics and experience, aims to bring the 

community together through creating and collaborating with retailers on fresh 

experiential concepts to constantly captivate shoppers.”

To better engage and connect with our shoppers, in December 2018, we launched our 

first customer loyalty platform for our three malls – United Square,Velocity@Novena 

Square and KINEX. Known as U-POPP, which stands for UOL’s Power of Purchase 

Program, members get to redeem rewards and earn loyalty points at our three malls. 

The initiative allows us to access shoppers' preferences to understand them better 

and provide better service. 



A permanent pop-up retail concept was introduced to 

refresh brand and product experiences.

KINEX offers a new level of experiential shopping after 

the rebranding.

BECOMING MORE ECO-FRIENDLY

Novena Square, comprising two office blocks and a retail mall, was first opened in 2000.

In our commitment to reducing the environmental impact of existing buildings, in 

2018, Novena Square went through an extensive retrofitting to improve water and 

energy efficiencies. Some new features were also added to encourage shoppers 

and tenants to reduce their carbon footprint. The initiatives included:

• retrofitting the chiller plant system for better efficiency

• installing motion sensors and energy efficient lighting 

• using smart metering system to monitor water consumption 

• using fit flow regulators in taps to regulate water flow and minimise wastage

• building dedicated bicycle lots

• making priority parking lots available for hybrid or electric vehicles 

• installing carpark guidance system to direct drivers to the nearest available parking lot

The positive outcome of the retrofitting was seen by the significant increase in our 

resource use efficiency. The energy consumption by GFA occupied of Novena Square 

reduced by 22.8% in 2018 compared with 2017, while the water consumption per 

GFA occupied reduced by 8.8% in 2018 compared with 2017.

For its green effort, Novena Square was awarded Green Mark GoldPlus for an Existing 

Non-Residential Building by the Building and Construction Authority.

We recognise that our business operations will have an impact on the environment. 

Environmental and efficiency considerations are therefore factored in from design, to 

construction and operation. We also monitor the environmental performance of our 

properties and improve the resource-efficiency of our managed buildings through 

ongoing maintenance and fit-out. 

ENVIRONMENT



For its environmentally-friendly 

features, Novena Square was 

conferred the BCA Green Mark 

GoldPlus award.

In 2018, our commercial properties achieved an 18.8% reduction of energy intensity by 

GFA occupied compared with the base year of 2010, thus exceeding our target of 16% 

reduction by 2020 by nearly two years in advance. We recorded a reduction of 1.2% 

and 16.2% year-on-year in energy intensity by GFA occupied for our offices and mixed 

development buildings respectively.  

Our hospitality business is on track towards meeting its target of 27% reduction in energy 

intensity by guest night by 2020 compared with the base year of 2013, having achieved 

a 26.3% reduction in 2018. 

In 2018, while our hospitality business achieved a 4.5% reduction in total energy 

consumed compared with 2017, the energy intensity by guest night increased by 2.8% 

compared with 2017. Therefore, we did not meet our year-on-year target of 2% reduction. 

This was mainly due to the disproportionate decrease in guest nights versus energy use.

Overall, the Group’s energy consumption and GHG emissions were 114,979 MWh and 

47,861 tonnes of CO2 equivalent respectively in 2018. This was a reduction of 6.4% 

from 2017 in both energy consumption and GHG emissions. 

Building energy includes electricity consumption from the grid, cooling consumption, 

piped gas and diesel used onsite. Given the nature of their operations, our hotels have 

the highest energy and water consumption, and are the largest contributor to the Group’s 

building energy and water consumption.

Our hospitality business continues to focus on initiatives to improve operational efficiency 

across its properties including, for example, installing Building Management Systems 

and centralised digital chiller plant systems to improve monitoring of consumption 

and utility data, and upgrading electrical fan motors and switchboards to more energy- 

efficient variants.

with a water intensity reduction of 7.9% in 2018 compared with 2017. This was a result from 

our daily water monitoring and tracking initiatives, installation of constant flow regulators at 

the water basins and shower facilities in guest rooms, and usage of harvested rainwater for 

non-potable water consumption.

In 2018, the Group’s building water consumption was 846.7 thousand m3. Water used at all our 

properties is from municipal sources.

Energy and water consumption figures per year are highly dependent on the phase of 

construction. Consumption is typically heaviest during the middle phase of development 

projects. Development projects active during 2018 included The Clement Canopy, 

Principal Garden, The Tre Ver, Botanique at Bartley and Pan Pacific Orchard. 

In 2018, total energy consumed at our development projects was 34,202 GJ (or 34.2 

TJ). Energy consumed mainly comes from electricity and diesel use (the latter when a 

connection to the municipal supply has not yet been established). Total GHG emissions 

was 2,825 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, with a breakdown of 2,026 tonnes and 799 tonnes 

from Scope 1 and Scope 2 respectively. The GHG intensity by tonnes value of work 

completed was 17.6 of CO2 equivalent per thousand dollars.

ENERGY AND WATER CONSUMPTION 

FOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS

Total water consumption from municipal sources was 132.9 thousand m3 in 2018. 

One of our initiatives to reduce water use at our development projects is to use 

wastewater from construction activities to wash trucks and other vehicles before they 

leave the construction sites. These vehicles are washed to minimise pollution to the 

public road surfaces. 

All main contractors undertaking our projects in 2018 were certified to ISO 14001 and 

Green and Gracious Builder. 

Contractors are awarded The Green and Gracious Builder certification by the BCA for 

meeting high standards in environmental and social practices including material use, 

GHG emissions, water use and air quality.

For the first time in 2018, we reported on waste and recycling from all of our commercial 

properties, hotels and serviced suites.

In 2018, the Group recorded 7,629.6 tonnes of waste disposed with a breakdown of 

3,833.4 tonnes and 3,796.2 tonnes from our commercial properties and hospitality 

business respectively. 

Our commercial properties sent 375.9 tonnes of waste for recycling, while our hospitality 

business sent 84.8 tonnes.

WASTE AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

Our corporate office is located within one of our commercial properties. In 2018, the 

corporate office used 331.3 MWh of energy, an increase from 315.7 MWh in 2017. 

GHG emissions also increased by 4.9% from 132.4 tonnes of CO2 in 2017 to 138.9 

tonnes in 2018. The increase in energy consumed was due to the increase in our corporate 

office headcount.

reporting with the GRI requirements and the other parts of our business. In 2018, 

there were 24 non-fatal workplace incidents in our hospitality business compared 

with 45 in 2017. As such, the AFR decreased from 10.8 in 2017 to 6.4 in 2018. However, 

the number of lost man days from these incidents was higher than in 2017 and as such 

the ASR increased from 56.9 in 2017 to 101.0 in 2018.

WORKPLACE SAFETY FOR HOSPITALITY BUSINESS

There were no substantiated issues concerning guest safety and security in 2018. 

GUEST SAFETY AND SECURITY

The number of injuries reported at all buildings was 53 (124 in 2017) in 2018. This 

included guests, tenants and visitors, as well as employees and contractors in our 

commercial properties.

INCIDENT REPORTING

Ensuring the safety and security and enhancing the well-being of guests in our hospitality 

business is a fundamental priority. 

To highlight this commitment, our hospitality business launched a comprehensive Food 

Safety Management System (FSMS) in 2018. The programme includes extensive food 

safety training along with external audits along the entire food chain, from receipt of 

raw produce, preparation to delivery. The programme enhances our existing procedures 

and helps cultivate best practice in our food safety culture. 

Our hotels maintained our track record for food safety. A marginal number of cases 

were reported and thoroughly investigated with laboratory tests, where possible. No 

indications of contamination were found in any of the samples in 2018.

PEOPLE

In 2018, the Group employed 1,827 persons in Singapore, with over 90% employed in 

the hospitality business. In terms of employees leaving the business in 2018, the 

turnover rate of the property business increased from 10.1% in 2017 to 13.3% in 2018, 

while the turnover rate of the hospitality business decreased from 33.8% in 2017 

to 32.1%. However, over the last five years, the turnover rate for the Group has steadily 

decreased with turnover rates for the property and hospitality businesses remaining 

below the respective national industry averages every year. 

The Group recorded an absentee rate of 2.8% in 2018 (unchanged from 2017), or 

roughly an average of 7.3 days of sick leave per employee based on a five-day work 

week. The absentee rate of our property business was 2.7% while that of the hospitality 

business was 2.8%.

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

We believe a diverse work environment will enrich our perspectives and attract  

high-calibre candidates from the widest talent pool. Our workforce consists of nearly  

20 nationalities across the Group. 

In our property business, 40% of Senior Management were female, while 60% were 

male (44% female and 56% male in 2017). In our hospitality business, 48% of Senior 

Management of our various business units were female, while 52% were male (45% 

female and 55% male in 2017). 

We continue to promote the redeployment of mature workers into the business. As at end 

December 2018, 22.2% of employees in our property business and 19.8% of employees 

in our hospitality business were above the age of 50. 

We also foster a supportive and encouraging environment for our employees with children 

and dependents. The Group offers paternity leave to working fathers whose child is not 

a Singapore citizen, even though paternity leave is only applicable to employees whose 

child is a Singapore citizen under the Ministry of Manpower’s regulation.

We believe in leveraging and developing the skills of the people in our local 

communities. In 2018, 96.7% of Senior Management and 97.7% of other employees 

in our property business were Singaporeans or Permanent Residents, while 86.5% of 

Senior Management and 55.6% of other employees in our hospitality business were 

Singaporeans or Permanent Residents. We align ourselves with Singapore’s national 

targets on diversity and inclusion in our workforce.

For our hospitality business, the average training hours per employee was 94.6 hours, 

exceeding our target of 80 hours. The increase in training hours could be attributed to the 

new training framework with a refresher focus implemented in 2018, where all employees 

in our hospitality business received training on a range of courses. Topics such as service 

skills, service mindset and service culture were included in the 2018 training modules.

UOL supports Care Corner Student Care Centre, which provides before-and-after-

school care for students. The programme is also available to underprivileged children. 

In 2018, UOL sponsored the replacement of ceiling fans in its two centres, so that the 

children can learn and grow in a comfortable environment.

For the second year, UOL donated to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital Health Fund 

to support its Art Therapy Programme to benefit young patients from low-income 

families. We also continued to support the Riding for the Disabled Association (RDA) 

Singapore with a sponsorship to help in its mission to provide free horse-riding therapy 

to children and adults with physical and mental disabilities. The horses were also 

brought to United Square for our shoppers to interact with the horses and contribute to 

RDA Singapore’s fundraising effort. During the year, UOL supported Gardens by the Bay 

by adopting a sculpture, Watching Clouds, for five years.

UOL employees are encouraged to volunteer their time to help the less fortunate 

through staff volunteering activities. Two activities were organised during the year for 

the children from Care Corner Student Care Centre and the elderly from AWWA Senior 

Community Home.

Throughout the year, PPHG continued to further its “Eat Well With Us” initiative, with the 

Senior Chefs imparting their culinary skills and recipes to the resident cooks at charity 

homes. A pioneer of inclusive hiring in Singapore’s hospitality sector, PPHG collaborates 

with community partners such as SG Enable to offer students with special needs 

internships and employment at its hotels. PPHG also contributed to the welfare of 

caregivers by providing design expertise to Enabling Village’s Caregivers Pod, a dedicated 

multi-functional space for caregivers to organise peer support sessions and gatherings.

For its community contributions, PPHG was conferred the People’s Association 

Community Spirit Award and recognised as Champion of Good by the National 

Volunteer &amp; Philanthropy Centre for the first time.

UOL has been purchasing VSA paintings for its residential showflats. 

SUSTAINABLE EFFORT TO BRING ARTS  

TO OUR SPACES

UOL acknowledges the close relationship between art and design. Since 2014, UOL 

has been supporting Very Special Arts (VSA) Singapore, which aims to help artists 

with disabilities to integrate into the society.

UOL regularly purchases paintings from VSA to support its artists and help 

them to engage with a wider social community. To date, we have purchased 

over 30 VSA paintings for display in our residential showflats. In 2017, PPHG 

also collaborated with VSA to produce a rendered drawing based on an aerial 

photo of Kampong Glam, which is in the vicinity of PARKROYAL on Beach Road. 

Today, the artwork occupies a place at the Front Desk in the hotel lobby.

Wherever possible, we also provide opportunities for VSA artists to showcase their 

works. In June 2018, we dedicated a space for VSA when we held our first community 

event in Bishan. In support of the charity’s fundraising efforts, our management 

took the lead and purchased some of their paintings. PPHG was also a venue sponsor 

for VSA to hold its art exhibitions at Pan Pacific Singapore in 2017 and 2018. 



CREATING VIBRANT SPACES FOR 

COMMUNITIES TO CONNECT AND THRIVE

As one of the largest property developers in Singapore, UOL supports the nation’s 

vision for a more liveable and sustainable Singapore. Besides building quality 

homes and giving back to society, UOL is committed to building a more vibrant and 

inclusive society where people can connect and foster a strong community spirit. 

In June 2018, we organised our first community festival, Craving Communities, 

at a large open field in Bishan to engage our local community. The two-day event 

featured a line-up of local gourmet food, free craft workshops, a flea market, games, 

live band performances, as well as an open-air movie screening in the evening. VSA 

was also offered a space to raise funds through the sale of its paintings. There was 

a strong turnout from members of the public, and even Member of Parliament for 

Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC Chong Kee Hiong came to visit.

Mr Liam Wee Sin, Group Chief Executive, said: “The idea is we create spaces for 

communities and they must be inclusive. At the same time, we satisfy the cravings 

that Singaporeans have, which include a love for good food, a healthy lifestyle and of 

course, a quality home.”

In September 2018, a month-long Craving Communities event was organised at 

KINEX, which focuses on creating experiential appeal and community activities 

after the mall's rebranding. The outdoor plaza was transformed into a lively 

carnival, featuring popular street food from around the world, live music, band 

performances, and a flea market. There was also a series of free craft workshops for 

children and adults, making sure there was something for everyone.

Craving Communities has since become a signature UOL event at our malls and 

property launches as a form of greater community engagement.





A series of craft workshops was organised by KINEX. 

The first Craving Communities event by  

UOL was held in Bishan to engage the 

community with food and entertainment.

PPHG volunteers were happy that they brought smiles to the beneficiaries at Gardens by the Bay. 

The snowmen installation was a team effort from 

the beneficiaries and PPHG volunteers.

A COURSE FOR A CAUSE

Between July and August 2018, a record $75,000 was collected by PPHG, together 

with its payment partner Mastercard, towards a good cause. 

A percentage of the dining bills at eight restaurants within our hotels in Singapore was 

donated to six Day Activity Centres (DACs) operated by Autism Association Singapore, 

Cerebral Palsy Alliance Singapore, Metta Welfare Association, and St Andrew’s 

Autism Centre. These centres help adults with disabilities maximise their independence 

and provide welcome respite to caregivers.

To celebrate the achievement, 

PPHG collaborated with Singapore’s 

eco-artist Didier Ng to create an art 

installation at Gardens by the Bay. 

Under Didier’s guidance, PPHG 

volunteers and the beneficiaries from 

the DACs co-created a snowman-

themed artwork using waste plastic 

bottles and discarded fabrics. In 

addition, PPHG hosted a Christmas 

outing for 150 beneficiaries to view 

their artwork and spend meaningful 

time with their families.

APPENDIX B: NOTES FOR SUSTAINABILITY 

PERFORMANCE DATA

GENERAL

1. 

Buildings

 

Mixed Developments: Novena Square and United Square

 

Offices: Faber House and Odeon Towers

 

Retail: KINEX

 

Hotels: PARKROYAL on Beach Road, PARKROYAL on Kitchener Road, PARKROYAL on Pickering, 

and Pan Pacific Singapore. Pan Pacific Orchard was excluded as it was closed for redevelopment 

on 1 April 2018.

 

Serviced Suites: PARKROYAL Serviced Suites Singapore, Pan Pacific Serviced Suites Beach Road, 

and Pan Pacific Serviced Suites Orchard

2. 

Development projects: Refer to construction and redevelopment activities that took place 

in Singapore, including joint ventures with UIC. Data for 2014 included Archipelago, a joint 

venture with UIC where the contract was structured such that UIC had operational control of the 

development phase. Riverbank@Fernvale was completed in 1Q2017. 

3. 

Corporate office: Refers to electricity consumption at UOL’s corporate office, based on utility bills. 

Water data is unavailable, as water is not separately metered. Our corporate office sits within 

United Square, and forms a subset of the building energy and water figures reported.

ENVIRONMENT

4. 

Coverage within building: Energy data from tenants is excluded for Mixed Developments, 

Offices and Retail properties. Energy data reported for Hotels and Serviced Suites includes areas 

owned and managed by PPHG, except for Pan Pacific Singapore where data includes retail and 

F&amp;B tenants.

5. 

District cooling: The BCA Energy Benchmarking Report excludes properties with district cooling, 

which can form a significant part of the energy consumption. One of our hotels, Pan Pacific 

Singapore, uses district cooling technology.

6. 

GFA and GFA occupied: We report our energy, GHG emissions, water, and waste intensity figures 

by GFA and GFA occupied.

 

We adopt BCA’s definition for GFA. All covered floor areas of a building, except otherwise 

exempted, uncovered areas for commercial uses, are deemed the GFA of the building. 

Generally, car parks are excluded from GFA computation.

 

GFA occupied is calculated by occupancy rate (simple average of monthly occupancy rates) 

multiplied by GFA.

 

Odeon Towers has a reduced GFA from 23,273 m2 to 23,236 m2 (reduced by 37 m2 or 0.2%) 

effective 1 July 2015. We recognise this change in our reporting from 2016 onwards.

 

The GFA for PARKROYAL Serviced Suites Singapore was updated in 2018 to reflect improved data. 

The new GFA was applied to historical years (where relevant).


UOL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

UOL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

7.  

Guest night: We adopt the definition from EarthCheck, a leading tourism benchmarking group. 

Guest night includes i) guests/staff staying overnight, ii) day/banquet guests and iii) non-resident 

restaurant guests, as illustrated in the equation below:

 

Guest night = Overnight guests/staff + (Day/banquet guests ÷ 3) + (Non-resident restaurant 

guests ÷ 4)

i) Guests/staff staying overnight: The number of guests staying overnight equals the number people 

staying over each night (including complimentary stays and staff that live on-site), added up over 

the year.

 

Example: Two people sharing a room for three nights is equal to 6 guest nights (2 x 3)

 

ii) Day guests: Day guests represent the number of non-resident day guests (for example, the 

number of people turning up to use on-site facilities such as a spa, golf course, MICE or business 

centre, but do not stay overnight) added up over the year.

 

Day guests would also include delegates attending day conferences and/or functions. Please 

note that ‘Day guests’ does not include restaurant covers.

 

Example: Over the year, a hotel’s fitness centre received an additional 3,750 non-resident users. 

This would be equivalent to 1,250 guest nights (3,750 ÷ 3).

iii) Non-resident restaurant guests: Non-resident restaurant guests represent the number of non-

resident day guests (for example, the number of people turning up to dine at F&amp;B outlets/

restaurants, but do not stay overnight) added up over the Benchmarking period (typically 

365 days).

 

Example: Over the year, a hotel’s restaurants/F&amp;B outlets received an additional 2,000  

non-resident restaurant users. This would be equivalent to 500 guest nights (2,000 ÷ 4).

8.  

Building and development site details including property type, area and occupancy rates are 

available in UOL Annual Report 2018’s Property Summary, pages 64-71.

9.  

GHG conversion is based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Emission factors for electricity 

generation are sourced from the Energy Market Authority (EMA), 2018. Electricity Grid Emission 

Factor for 2016 - 2017 were updated from the EMA. Due to this, past year emission data for 

2016 and 2017 were restated based on figures from EMA, which had a slight (&lt;2%) difference 

from figures used previously. Greenhouse Gas Protocol Emission Factors from Cross Sector 

Tools, March 2017 were used for diesel conversions. The Global Warming Potential of CH4 and N2O 

is not considered because its effect on the overall emissions is insignificant. 

10.  

Waste data for Mixed Developments, Offices and Retail properties include all users of 

the buildings.

11.  

Waste data for Hotels and Serviced Suites includes guests, but excludes retail and F&amp;B tenants, 

except for PARKROYAL on Beach Road, where waste data includes disposal from PARKROYAL 

Serviced Suites Singapore and tenants at The Plaza, as these properties share the same 

disposal receptacle.

12.  

Waste intensity for hospitality is derived by total number of guest nights for simplicity.

13. 

Source of conversion factor from diesel in litres to kWh is the Carbon Disclosure Project. Technical 

Note. Conversion of fuel data to MWh, 2016.

HEALTH AND SAFETY

14. 

Workplace health and safety data include development projects and hospitality. 

 

Coverage for development projects: workplace accidents to main contractors and sub-contractors

 

Coverage for hospitality: workplace accidents to all employees and contractors at hotels and 

serviced suites

15. 

Accident frequency rate is defined as the number of workplace accidents for every one million man-

hours worked.

16. 

Number of man-hours worked in safety data reported:

 

Development projects: The number of man-hours includes main contractors’ and sub-contractors’ 

hours.

 

Hospitality: The number of man-hours includes employees’ and contractors’ hours.

17. 

Workplace accidents must be reported to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) if the accident results 

in hospitalisation for 24 hours or more or medical leave for three days, whether consecutive or not. 

Fatalities as a result of work must also be reported to MOM.

18. 

National industry figures are obtained from the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Institute,  

an initiative driven by MOM and WSH Council.

19. 

The new standard ISO 45001 will replace OHSAS 18001. Companies must migrate to the new 

standard by March 2021. One of the main contractors for a development project in 2018 has 

been certified to the new ISO 45001 standard.

PEOPLE

20.  

While UOL Management Services (UMS) is a wholly-owned subsidiary, the working relationship is 

such that UMS is considered to be a contractor supplying facility management services to UOL. 

As such, figures reported for our property business exclude UMS as employees and instead 

report figures relating to UMS under contractors, where applicable.

21.  

There are no significant variations in the total number of employees for both our property and 

hospitality businesses.

22.  

Scheduled workday is calculated by 5 days x 52 weeks minus actual public holidays, actual annual 

leave and actual parental leave.

23. 

A significant portion of the property development business is performed by our contractors  

during construction. Facilities management services are provided by UOL Management Services.

24.  

Training figures for 2012 to 2015 do not include the corporate office of our hospitality business. 

These figures are provided in 2016 and onwards.

25.  

Average training hours per employee = Total training hours for the year / Number of employees as 

at 31 December.

26.  

For employee age classification, our property business defines employee age by birth date, 

whereas our hospitality business defines employee age by calendar year. We intend to align the 

classifications in future.

27. 

The definition of Senior Management is 'Assistant General Manager and above' for the property 

business, whereas for the hospitality business, it is 'Vice President and above, Executive 

Committee Member and Head of Department'.

COMMUNITY

28.  

We track our community contributions internally and currently do not report on it externally, 

as this report is focused on our key material topics.

COMPLIANCE

29.  

Scope of number of significant fines or non-monetary sanctions includes:

 

 

• Non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

 

 

• Incidents of non-compliance concerning the health and safety impacts of products and services.

 

 

• Substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy and losses of customer data.

 

 

• Non-compliance with laws and regulations in the social and economic area.

INDEPENDENT LIMITED ASSURANCE REPORT

To the Directors of UOL Group Limited

CONCLUSION

We were engaged by the Board of Directors of UOL Group Limited (the Group) to provide limited 

assurance on the accompanying UOL Sustainability Report for the year ended 31 December 2018 (the 

Report), and the selected Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards disclosures (Selected

(a) 

the Report has not described the sustainability practices on a comply-or-explain basis with 

reference to the following components as listed under Rule 711B of the Singapore Exchange’s 

(SGX) Listing Manual;

 

• Material environmental, social and governance factors;

 

• Policies, practices and performance;

 

• Targets;

 

• Sustainability reporting framework; and

 

• Board statement;

(b) 

the Selected GRI Disclosures as identified in the table below, are not calculated, in all material 

respects, in accordance with the relevant topic-specific disclosures requirements in the GRI 

Standards: Core Option.

RESTRICTION ON USE

This report has been prepared for the Directors of UOL Group Limited for the purpose of providing 

an assurance conclusion on the Report and Selected GRI Disclosures and may not be suitable for 

another purpose.  We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this report, to any 

person other than the Directors of UOL Group Limited, or for any other purpose than that for which it 

was prepared.

AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES

Our responsibility is to carry out a limited assurance engagement in accordance with SSAE 3000 and 

to express a conclusion based on the work performed.  SSAE 3000 requires that we plan and perform 

the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Report is free from material 

misstatement.  The extent of our work performed depends on our professional judgement and our 

assessment of the engagement risk. 

A limited assurance engagement consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for 

the preparation of information presented in the Report, and applying analytical and other evidence 

gathering procedures, as appropriate.  These procedures included:

• 

Interviews with relevant staff at the corporate and business unit level responsible for providing 

the information in the Report.

• 

Visits to offices and properties operating in Singapore selected on the basis of a risk analysis 

including the consideration of both quantitative and qualitative criteria.

• 

Enquires about the design and implementation of the systems and methods used to collect and 

report on the GRI Disclosures, including the aggregation of the reported information.

• 

Comparing the GRI Disclosures presented in the Report to corresponding information in the relevant 

underlying sources to determine whether all the relevant information contained in such underlying 

sources has been appropriately included in the GRI Disclosures.

• 

Reading the information presented in the Report to determine whether it is in line with our overall 

knowledge of, and experience with, the sustainability performance of the Group.

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are 

less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement.  Consequently, the level of assurance obtained 

in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been 

obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.

Due to the inherent limitations of any internal control structure it is possible that errors or irregularities 

in the information presented in the Report may occur and not be detected.  Our engagement is not designed 

to detect all weaknesses in the internal controls over the preparation and presentation of the Report, 

as the engagement has not been performed continuously throughout the period and the procedures 

performed were undertaken on a test basis.
