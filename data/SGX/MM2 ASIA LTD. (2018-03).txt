Board Statement 

 

 

 

 

 

The evolution of content creation has presented many opportunities for mm2 Asia Ltd. (the “Company” or “mm2 

Asia”, together with its subsidiaries, the “Group” or “we” or “us” or “our”) to tap on. The content-cum-platform 

business model continues to be our focus, and our vertical extensions across all stages of the content value chain 

add to our competitive advantage.  

The Board of Directors of mm2 Asia is delighted to present our first Sustainability Report that is in accordance 

with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”). The Company conducted the first materiality assessment which 

identified the topics deemed to be material to our stakeholders. It is vital that mm2 Asia achieve sustainable 

success in the business and meet today’s needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet 

their own.  

We establish ourselves as the leading content and entertainment company in Asia and we take pride as a 

responsible content creator. In the pursuit of growth, we innovate ways to grow our core business in North Asia, 

expand our cinema business in Malaysia and Singapore, and promote continual growth of our event production 

and concert promotion business. The Group is aware of the technology trends that are dramatically reshaping the 

media landscape. In view of the rapid evolution, we focus on strengthening our proficiency in all stages of the 

content value chain. Our sustainability efforts are led by our senior management to ensure that we commit to 

sustainable development in line with business objectives.  

This Sustainability Report will be tapping on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues which are 

crucial to our stakeholders. They are namely:  

(1) Economic performance; 

(2) Energy 

(3) Effluents and waste;  

(4) Diversity and equal opportunity; and  

(5) Marketing and labelling.

Supply Chain Management 

 

We recognise the impact value chain has on the Group’s growth. Our key strengths lie in the content we acquire, 

produce and distribute. We aim to present a creative filmmaking solution which starts from content creation to its 

distribution and exhibition. As a producer, we actively seek content providers who will engage us for our film 

production services. Our major suppliers for hiring of casts and crews, props, venue rental, food and beverage as 

well as film rentals are selected based on quality of goods/services, delivery schedule, pricing and payment terms.  

Our Group has established Suppliers Evaluation Policy and Procedures which assists us in our supplier selection 

and evaluation process. We ensure that our suppliers adhere to the Supplier Code of Conduct and are committed 

to high quality, environmental, health and safety standards. Our Group does not have long term agreements with 

any key suppliers as services required vary from project to project.  

Our Group also ensures that our Directors, substantial or any Associates are independent of the major suppliers. 

We ensure there are no Directors and Executive Officers are materially dependent on any industrial, commercial 

or financial contract with any supplier.

External Initiatives  

mm2 Asia has always been an advocate of sustainable practices, and entrenched in our corporate culture is the 

spirit of engaging the local communities. We have multiple programs and activities in place that involve the 

inclusion of local communities, such as workshops to find new aspiring filmmakers and television personalities, 

and the setup of the mm2-NTU Bursary Fund.  

 

The major external initiatives we have engaged with include: 

1. 

Industry Development 

Since 2015, mm2 Entertainment Pte Ltd, a 

wholly-owned subsidiary of mm2 Asia, has 

organised an annual short film competition- 

“mm2 Movie Makers Awards”, where the top 

three winners are offered an opportunity to 

develop a feature film with mm2 Entertainment. 

After two years in Singapore, the mm2 Movie 

Makers Awards was organised for the first time 

in Hong Kong in 2017. Furthermore, extensive 

invitations were given out to established 

scriptwriters from Hong Kong and Taiwan to 

conduct scriptwriting masterclasses, share their 

insights and nurture new talents.  

 

2. mm2-NTU Bursary Fund  

In 2017, through the NTU Development Office, 

mm2 Asia set up the mm2-NTU Bursary Fund, 

with the aim to support students who need 

financial aid to pursue their studies in Digital 

Animation or Digital Filmmaking. mm2 Asia 

has pledged to donate a total amount of 

S$160,000 between 2017 and 2021, funding 2 

bursary awards of S$6,000 each, annually. 

S$100,000 of the total donation will go into the 

Endowed 

Fund, 

which 

allows 

for 

the 

sustainable generation of returns in perpetuity, 

ensuring the continuity of the mm2-NTU 

Bursary Fund. 

To date, mm2 Asia has fulfilled 40% of its 

financial commitment.

Membership of Associations and Certificates  

Our subsidiary, Cathay Cineplexes Pte Ltd was a member of the largest trade association in the world for movie 

theatre owners, National Association of Theatre Owners until June 2018. 

Governance and Sustainability Approach  

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of mm2 Asia are firmly committed to set in place corporate governance 

practices to provide the structure through which the objectives of protection of shareholders’ interests and 

enhancement of long-term sustainability of the Group’s business and performance are met. 

Conflict of interest policy  

The Group has adopted a conflict of interest policy to guide our employees in the identification and management 

of conflict of interests. All of our key management staff, including but not limited to our Executive Directors and 

Executive Officers, are to complete the annual conflict of interest disclosures to our Board. The Group also 

reminds our staff regularly of their duty to disclose any conflict of interests.  

 

Fraud and whistle blowing policy and procedure 

Our Group has disclosed in our Corporate Governance Report page 34 that whistle blowing policy is implemented 

for employees to highlight any inappropriate matter regarding financial reporting. We also published the policy 

in our website &lt;https://www.mm2asia.com/corporate-governance&gt;. This Policy is established to facilitate the 

development of controls that will aid in the detection and prevention of fraud and other irregularities against the 

Group. It is intended to provide a framework to promote responsible and secure fraud and whistle blowing without 

fear of adverse consequences. This policy assists our Audit Committee in managing allegations of fraud or any 

form of misconduct initiated following the completion of appropriate and fair investigations.  

 

Sustainability Approach  

 

The Board is responsible for the governance of risk across the Group. Senior management periodically assesses 

focus areas where our Group can have the greatest economic, environmental and social impact, as well as the 

areas that are most important to our stakeholders. The board will consider sustainability issues, e.g. environmental 

and social factors, as part of our strategic formulation. 

 

Our Group seeks opinions from various stakeholders either through informal or formal means. We evaluate the 

needs and expectations of our key stakeholder groups which are significant to our Company’s value creation 

strategy and strive to build mutual beneficial relationships.

Stakeholder Engagement 

As we embark on our sustainability journey, it is vital to identify our key stakeholders and material aspects that 

are relevant to our business operations. We strongly value concerns and expectations of our key stakeholders when 

formulating corporate strategies. We endeavor to grow our business and concurrently, maintain constructive 

engagement across all stakeholders by consulting them regularly and responding to these needs.  

 

It is our responsibility to establish a long term business relationship with all stakeholders.

Defining the materiality issues 

 

The material issues are identified based on the significance of ESG and economic impacts and degree of influence 

on the stakeholders’ assessment and decisions. Considering stakeholders’ feedbacks, challenges faced and trends 

in sustainability, we have carefully considered several topics that are material to our stakeholders. Thus, we 

conclude our sustainability efforts and report on these issues.

Economic Performance 

 

mm2 Asia is proud to present the growth in the Group’s core business revenue of 65% or $37.0 million from 

FY2017 to FY2018. Growth of core business in North Asia contributed to the growth of the Group’s total revenue, 

which formed 34.4% of the Group’s total revenue. The expansion of our cinema business and continual growth 

of our event production and concert promotion business also contributed to the increase in our Group’s revenue. 

With the increased demand for better services and higher quality content production, we acquired 13 cinema 

businesses from Lotus Fivestar Cinemas (M) Sdn. Bhd. Although the acquisition of these assets resulted in an 

increase in expenses for the financial year, the Group was still able to generate profit before tax of $40.9 million 

in FY2018. This demonstrates our ability to create a sustainable business growth model to our stakeholders, in the 

ever-changing and competitive industry.  

Our Group will continue to strengthen our core business and exercise prudence in pursuit of opportunities and 

maintaining investment discipline at all times.  

 

 

 

The Group recognises great business opportunities in North Asia, and as a result, has decided to aggressively 

expand into those territories. We also recognise the challenges that are present but we believe that due to our 

business ethics, originality in content creation, and sustainable spending, we will remain competitive in this 

challenging industry, and will strive to be in the forefront of quality content creation and film marketing.  

Moreover, we have diversification and expertise in many different fields, such as content producing (TV and 

digital), marketing and distribution, creative solutions, talent management and industry development. This 

differentiates us from the rest of the industry as we provide a full suite of services to serve a wide range of 

customers and stakeholders in the film and TV industry.

Energy  

 

Our main source of energy consumption comes from usage of lighting, audio, filming equipment and air-

conditioning at our office premises as well as the cinemas. Reducing our total energy consumption not only 

generates cost savings for us, it also helps us further our Group’s values in environmental conservation. We are 

focused on being energy efficient, saving energy through building employee awareness and monitoring our energy 

consumption across the Group.  

Energy consumption at our cinemas is dependent on the number of movie sessions scheduled and movie run-

times. In order to provide better dynamic movie timings for the consumers, movie sessions have increased. With 

the commencement of screening at our cinema at Parkway Parade from the beginning of the year, our energy 

consumption has correspondingly increased as well. Nonetheless, we continue to encourage conservation of 

energy by ensuring that all lighting equipment are to be switched off or put into sleep mode when they are not in 

use.   

 

 

* Note: Energy consumption in value (S$) for cinema operations in FY 2017 and FY 2018.    

 

In our continuous efforts to be more energy efficient, we have embarked on a pilot project with OTTO Solutions 

to support our cinema operations by identifying and replacing the existing lightings with LED lights. We will be 

spearheading this project through our cinema at Orchard Cineleisure with a target to reduce annual energy 

consumption by 31,313 kWh from the usage of energy-saving lightings. This project will then be used as a case 

study for the rest of our cinemas.

Diversity and Equal Opportunities 

 

Our senior management promotes the value that everyone has a voice of his/her own. We have an open concept 

office, which encourages creativity. In mm2 Asia, we promote diversity and equality at work as we recognise the 

diversity of our people as a pillar of strength for our organisation. We seek to create an environment that allow 

our employees to thrive and share their experiences necessary to drive performance and innovation.  

As mm2 Asia is geographically diverse, we aim to consider different societies and cultures in countries where our 

subsidiaries operate. We must be sensitive to different business values and traditions, and respect the local 

business cultures in place and the work dynamics.

Effluents and Waste (For Our Cinema Operation) 

 

mm2 Asia constantly strives to achieve sustainable waste management by adopting the 3Rs – Reduce, Reuse and 

Recycle. We take great strides in reducing the amount of waste generated. Through collaborative and innovative 

initiatives, our Group intends to develop ways to maintain a healthy environment.  

mm2 Asia adopts a comprehensive approach to environmental management beyond compliance, undertakes 

initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility and encourages the diffusion of environmentally 

friendly technologies. Initiatives and methods include separating wastes such as plastics, food waste, paper and 

electronic equipment which are segregated between hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

REDUCE 

We strive to reduce the usage of non-biodegradable plastic through eliminating plastic packaging and 

implementing reusable service ware. We will constantly improve our current packaging materials to more 

environmentally friendly material.  

In our stride to reduce our carbon footprint, we introduced some initiatives at our cinema operations during the 

year such as    

• 

Introduction of a new menu in Platinum Movie Suite in November 2018 which replaced plastic packaging 

with melamine service ware; 

• 

Replacement of Styrofoam cups with recyclable plastic cups; 

• 

Paper packaging purchased from our vendors to be PEFC (FSC) certified paper raw materials, ensuring 

that raw materials used in the packaging originate from sustainably managed forests. These forest 

certifications promote good governance and help to combat deforestation and illegal logging; 

• 

Use of digital vouchers instead of physical vouchers. 

At our office premises, we have introduced some initiatives to reduce our use of paper such as for the review of 

our ERP system. We have also introduced e-modules for the request/approval of requisitions, as well as the 

communication of memorandums and announcements via electronic copies in email instead of printing. 

 

 

 




 

 

17 

REUSE 

mm2 Asia adopts upcycling measures:  

• 

Reusing 3D glasses at our cinemas will help to reduce the costs of acquiring new 3D glasses for patrons; 

• 

Printing on recycled paper. 

 

RECYCLE 

mm2 Asia implements recycling initiatives in Cathay Cineplexes for plastics, papers and aluminium cans. We 

work with our cleaning company to provide litter bins which segregate recyclable items from general waste . We 

highly encourage our cinema patrons to adopt good recycling habits when they visit our cinemas by utilising these 

bins.   

Fried finger food had always been one of the more popular option on the menu, thus cooking oil is heavily used

and processed by a company that specialises in handling such wastes once every fortnight.

Marketing and Labelling  

mm2 Asia believes in bringing accurate information and educating our viewers through brand communication.  

We ensure that all content production and services in advertisements, marketing collaterals and websites are 

labelled with film classification. In addition, they are labelled with the producers’ names, endorsement from 

authorities, production release date, running time and cast. 

When making a classification decision for a film, the senior management of mm2 Asia takes careful consideration 

of the film’s content and other relevant factors and concerns. We abide by Singapore’s classification guidelines 

which are enforced by Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA). All film productions produced by our 

Group are rated and evaluated according to the film classification. Our Group is committed to complying with 

Films Act 1991 and codes before releasing of films.  

As a leading film and media company, our primary responsibility lies in the films we acquire and distribute. We 

demonstrate our commitment to responsible marketing for our audiences. We only advertise our content 

production that is appropriate and adheres to Singapore Code of Advertising Practice administered by the 

Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore (ASAS). 

As a matter of principle, mm2 Asia advertises content in strict conformity with legal requirements as well as with 

ethical and cultural standards. We expressly avoid the use of sexist, discriminatory, political, pornographic, 

extremist and violence-glorifying advertising. mm2 Asia adheres to our own sustainable business practices and 

guidelines established by our marketing communications team. As a way of considering these factors, our content 

is approved by the marketing communication team before being published.  

The Group is also sensitive to the content that is published online, via social media such as Facebook, Instagram, 

and Twitter. Rules such as Facebook’s community standards on advertising are strictly adhered to, to ensure that 

we employ a legal and ethical method for reaching out to our patrons.  

To further promote our content production, we will continue our commitment to responsible marketing and 

carefully label all films with rating classification.
