Kencana agri limited (“Kencana”, "the group") is an 

indonesian plantation company engaged mainly in 

the cultivation of oil palms; processing of Fresh Fruit 

bunches (“FFb”) into crude palm oil (“cpo”), crude 

palm Kernel oil (“cpKo”) and palm Kernel cake (“pKc”); 

provision of bulking, port and logistics services. the 

company was officially listed on the main board of the 

Singapore exchange ("SgX") on July 25th, 2008. [102-1]

[102-2][102-5]

the group’s palm oil plantations are located in the 

islands of Sumatra, Kalimantan and Sulawesi in 

indonesia. Since its inception in 1995, the group’s 

planted area has grown to approximately 68,483 ha in 

2017, including plasma areas, along with five palm oil 

mills with a total processing capacity of 275 tonnes per 

hour and two kernel crushing plants with the capacity 

of 435 tonnes per day. [102-6][102-4]

to date, the group has planted up to 36% of its total 

landbank and aims to continue expanding its planted 

area in a sustainable manner. the group’s potential is 

not fully realized yet as 53% of its nucleus palm oil trees 

are still in the immature and young mature stage. this 

relatively young profile of palm oil trees, with weighted 

average of 8.9 years, will soon enter their prime mature 

phase, driving up the potential for strong FFb production 

growth in the next few years.

as part of its strong commitment in environmental 

aspects 

of 

sustainability 

and 

corporate 

Social 

responsibility (“cSr”), the group invested in two 

renewable biomass power plants in bangka-belitung 

islands, with another power plant currently under 

construction in bangka, whilst working together with 

the state owned electricity company, pt. perusahaan 

listrik negara (“pln”) to supply “green” electricity to 

the local community. in addition, the group has signed 

an emissions reduction purchase agreement (“erpa”) 

with the danish ministry of climate and energy to attain 

certified emission reduction (“cer”) credits.

moreover, the group strives to attain indonesian 

Sustainable palm oil (“iSpo”) certifications for all its 

plantations as required by the indonesian government 

as well as other sustainability certifications. two of its 

subsidiaries, pt. Sawindo Kencana and pt. alamraya 

Kencana mas, have been certified by both iSpo and 

international Sustainable and carbon certification 

(“iScc”). pt. Sawindo Kencana currently a member of 

roundtable on Sustainable palm oil (“rSpo”). [102-12]

in 2015, Kencana issued its first Sustainability policy 

to reflect its commitment to develop its plantation 

business based on best management practices that are 

sustainable and environmentally friendly, while also 

ensuring to comply with applicable government rules 

and regulations in areas where it operates. the group’s 

second annual Sustainability report is a continuation of 

our commitment to our Sustainability policy and part 

of the group’s journey and efforts towards developing 

its best sustainability practices. our first Fy 2015 

Sustainability report was published in august 2016, and 

as part of our commitment to achieve growth through 

sustainability, we will be publishing our Sustainability 

report on an annual basis. this report has been 

prepared in accordance with the gri Standards: core 

option. [102-51][102-52][102-54]

Scope and Boundaries

the scope of this report is based on our operations in 

Sumatra, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi, indonesia for the

and evaluation of all aspects of sustainability practices 

with regards to related stakeholders including but not 

limited to; our suppliers, the environment, customers, 

community, employees and the protection of employee 

rights, as well as respect for human rights. [102-50]

ChaiRman’s sTaTemenT [102-14]

dear Shareholders,

on behalf of the board of directors, it is my pleasure to 

present Kencana’s Second Sustainability report for the 

year ended december 31, 2017.

Realizing Our Sustainability Practices

2017 was a year where the group continued to 

implement our Sustainability policy, hand in hand with 

implementing iSpo and iScc certifications where pt. 

Sawindo Kencana and pt. alamraya Kencana mas both 

attained iSpo and iScc certifications. 

as Kencana grows through the years, we are commit-

ted to continue to implement eco friendly practices, 

and improve our quality and productivity of the planta-

tions. our strategy is to deliver economic performance 

whilst strengthening our environmental, social and 

governance (eSg) values by reaching out further, be-

yond our operations into our stakeholders.  

in doing so we make improvement on plasma pro-

grammes, standard operating procedures, traceabil-

ity, our workers competencies through both in-house 

and external trainings, and energy efficiencies. as the 

group grows we recognize that health and safety will 

always run adjacent to our daily operations. in 2017 we 

gratefully report that there was zero fatality. through 

our learning curves, the group continues to improve its 

methods and implementation to ensure the health and 

safety of our workers. the group certified eight occupa-

tional Health and Safety (aK3 umum) officers around 

the estates to help train other workers and prevent 

accidents. We expect the number of our certified aK3 

umum officers to rise in the coming years. 

as we continue to protect our conservation areas as 

stated in our Sustainability policy by way of implementing 

Hcv and HcS studies, the group identified 18,081 Ha of 

conservation area.   

Moving Forward

We expect more robust sustainability practices to be 

implemented within our plantations by way of more 

plantations being iSpo certified and improved Health 

and Safety. We would also be completing our 6th mill 

which will be our first in the Sulawesi region. as we have 

left the el nino behind, the group will also expect higher 

production resulting from more favourable weather 

conditions. While the market will be volatile in the short 

run, we believe that in the long run the demand for 

palm oil will be well supported by global consumption 

growth coming from increasing global population and 

wealth.

Appreciation

on behalf of the board of directors, i would like to thank 

all our stakeholders and all of our staff for their hard 

work, continued support, commitment, and dedication.

We are confident of meeting future challenges and 

seizing opportunities which may come our way to take 

the group to the next level of sustainable growth.

Stakeholder Engagement

Stakeholder engagement is recognized as an integral part in our attempts 

to become a more sustainable group achieved through numerous 

sustainability programs along with continuous efforts to improve. our 

key stakeholders have been identified through our activities in the palm 

oil sector and comprises: shareholders, customers, employees, non-

governmental organizations, industry groups, and government agencies. 

these stakeholders are engaged through various platforms that help us 

gauge our performance in meeting their expectations as well as providing 

necessary feedback.

our engagement approach varies from formal to informal settings, with all 

issues being given due consideration and evaluation on the impact that 

our actions and decisions make on both the group and our stakeholders. 

Keeping all our stakeholders in mind, the group conducted an external 

stakeholder engagement survey to gauge feedback and determine the 

material topics that our stakeholders would like us to include within the 

contents of this report. our engagement principles are based on: inclusivity, 

materiality, and responsiveness [102-42]

Inclusivity

We consider our stakeholders to be those who have a direct interest in our 

business and those who are impacted by our business and how we operate.

Materiality

the stakeholder engagement process helps us identify and manage current 

and emerging issues.

Responsiveness

We continually monitor the changing environment in which we operate to 

ensure stakeholder concerns are captured and managed on a continuous 

basis. We recognize that material issues can be very complex with diverging 

stakeholder expectations. We endeavor to manage these expectations in a 

transparent, prudent and fair manner.

the survey enables the group to get a better understanding of any 

concerns from our stakeholders. these points of interests then become 

the groundwork material and matrix for our group Sustainability report. 

a thorough description of our stakeholders, their concerns, and our ability 

to manage and take action on these issues are outlined in the following 

table. the following data were feedback collected from the stakeholder 

engagement reviews we compiled throughout 2017.

sustainable and environmentally friendly, and also 

seeks, wherever possible, to ensure compliance with 

applicable government rules and regulations in areas

Material Analysis &amp; Evaluation

once key issues and concerns from our stakeholders 

have been identified through our stakeholder 

engagement process mentioned above, the group 

further analyzes these points of interests as well as 

evaluating impacts on our business and stakeholders. 

the priority and level of urgency for different matters 

are based on the utilization of the global reporting

materiality analysis with Kencana’s materiality matrix 

outlined below.

in the year 2015, gHg was one of the warmest issues 

for the oil palm industry globally. gHg is one of the 

most important requirements in iSpo and iScc 

certifications and serves as an important aspect of 

certified Sustainable palm oil ("cSpo") sales. as a 

form of the group’s commitment in sustainability 

development, our management invites all employees 

to cooperate in implementing gHg emission reduction 

throughout our group.

in 2017, our employees are more aware of the group’s 

environmental management implementation. thus, 

the highest materiality issue for the year 2017 was 

Health Safety &amp; environment.

as our culture shifted towards a more sustainable prac-

tice, our employees begin to realise that their health 

and safety is utmost importance. to improve their 

awareness, the group conducts trainings across the es-

tates and Head office, as well as certifying 2 additional  

occupational Health and Safety officers. this is done as 

part of the group’s commitment in acquiring a safe and 

healthy working environment

in the future, we aim to integrate Kencana’s material-

ity matrix to better align our business and stakeholder 

concerns more effectively. every year, we will continue 

to identify risks associated with our industry and will re-

categorize stakeholders based on the perceived level of 

impact.

Committee 

(ARC)

The role of the ARC is to assist the Board with discharging its responsibility to safeguard the Group’s 

assets, maintain adequate accounting records and develop and maintain an effective system of risk 

management and internal controls, including matters related to sustainability issues. The ARC has 

undertaken an annual review of the audit and non–audit services provided by the external auditors 

to satisfy it that the nature and extent of such services will not prejudice the independence and 

objectivity of the auditors before recommending their re–nomination to the Board

Communication with 

Shareholders

as our shareholders are one of the most important 

stakeholders for our business, the group ensures that 

there are regular and informative communications 

about the group's operations that will be useful for our 

stakeholders to know. any information pertaining to the 

group’s dealings are published via the SgXnet and also 

includes any news release about the group. price sensitive 

information are more cautiously updated and released 

to the public in order to reduce possible complications. 

note that the group does release all of its information 

online whether it be financially or operationally related. 

However, the timing of said release dates are determined 

the board meets regularly to review the group’s overall 

performance, to deliberate on specific issues includ-

ing major acquisitions and disposals, to approve the 

annual budget and to approve the release of the quar-

terly, half–yearly and year–end financial results. the 

board meets at least four times a year. in addition to the 

scheduled meetings, ad-hoc board briefings, confer-

ence calls and physical meetings are held as warranted 

by particular circumstances or as deemed appropriate 

by the board members. a total of five board meetings 

were held in 2017.

to assist the board in the execution of its duties, the board 

has established various board committees, namely the 

nominating committee (nc), the remuneration com-

mittee (rc) and the audit &amp; risk management committee 

(arc). each of these committees is empowered to make 

decisions on matters within its terms of reference.

besides carrying out its statutory responsibilities the 

board’s role is also to consider sustainability issues, e.g. 

environmental and social factors, as part of its strategic 

formulation. our audit &amp; risk management committee is 

updated on a quarterly basis on matters relating to mate-

rial sustainability risks and concerns.

possible.

moreover, we also publish annual reports while notices 

of agms are sent to all shareholders. agms notices are 

also published in local newspapers and made available 

on the SgXnet. at the agms, shareholders are given the 

opportunity to express their views and raise any queries 

regarding the group.

all results are announced or issued within the assigned 

period and are available on the group’s website. the 

group strictly does not engage in selective disclosure.

[102-11] [102-17]

the group has zero tolerance on fraud and corruption. 

to mitigate the risk the group has place code of eth-

ics that are based on values and principles that serve 

as the fundamental aspects for working etiquette and 

decision making that has been adopted by the board of 

directors and applies to every director, officer and em-

ployee in all our companies. our code comprises val-

ues which include: compliance to laws and regulations, 

equality and non-discrimination, honesty and integrity 

through our anti-corruption and anti-bribery policies, 

work ethos morals and integrity, avoidance of conflit 

of interest, contribution and target achivement, being 

humble, work-life balance, mutual welfare, respecting 

human rights, and knowledge development. our code 

of ethics and policy has been socialized and hard copies 

have been distributed to all employees and directors. 

in addition, the group also provides guidance to the 

group’s directors and employees on their dealings in 

securities and other business ventures. 

moreover, the group risk management committee con-

ducts a meeting quarterly and identifies its key risks to 

assess the effectiveness of the risk management and in-

ternal control systems, especially dealing with financial, 

operational, compliance and climate change risks. the 

board, through the audit and risk management com-

mittee continuously identify, review and monitor the 

key risks, control measures and management actions as 

part of the risk management process.

the group’s risk management framework comprises 

of assessments which separate the risks into three 

categories: preventable, unpreventable and external. 

the risk management group would then utilize a risk 

matrix to determine the significant issues, which shall 

be prioritized and monitored in more sound manner. to 

ensure mitigation efforts are conducted accordingly the 

risks the committee place a quarterly meeting where 

risks are reviewed and subsequently reported to the 

audit and risk committee board meeting. 

in addition, embedded within our code of ethics and 

risk management, our whistleblowing policy, which 

is closely monitored by the internal audit, guarantees 

confidentiality and freedom in raising concerns. the 

whistleblowing policy shall identify contact points for 

reports in fraud, corruption, and other risks. We follow 

the spirit of our policy, and it has been socialized to our 

workers. 

External Initiatives and 

Associations [102-12] [102-13]

in light of our group's external initiatives, we commit 

and strive to adopt sustainable agricultural practices 

through certification with the iSpo, iScc, and/or 

rSpo certifications. in addition to our community 

development agendas and initiatives, stakeholder 

engagement and awareness is crucial to achieve 

the required certifications and approval as well as 

satisfaction from our external stakeholders.

to fulfill government regulations the group conducts 

environmental impact assessments, also known as 

“amdal” (analisis mengenai dampak lingkungan) as the 

first step to assessing new development areas. this step 

serves as a guide for Kencana to ensure that our operations 

will not have a negative impact on the environment. aside 

from amdal, the group also conducts Hcv and Social 

impact assessment (“Sia”) analyses to evaluate impacts of 

our operations before proceeding to planting.

another benefit of our external initiatives is the 

better communication of our sustainability standards 

throughout all our supply chains while at the same 

time firmly encouraging everyone to join in making a 

more sustainable business in general. Such initiatives 

will boost the group’s efforts in becoming a more 

sustainable business whose operations always aim to 

benefit and satisfy all our stakeholders.

to date, the group has participated actively as a member in 

a number of associations, namely: gabungan pengusaha 

Kelapa Sawit indonesia (“gapKi”), indonesian palm oil 

conference (“ipoc”), iScc, iSpo, rSpo, iSo (pc 248).

palm oil products have been part of our daily lives. around half of the 

products we use and consume everyday have palm oil mixed along with 

many different ingredients. based on oil World data in 2016, oil palm total 

planted area was only 6.6% of the total land needed to produce vegetable 

oil in the world. although small in hectarage, oil palm is still the largest 

contributor in vegetable oil, which was around 38.7% (palm oil and palm 

kernel oil) of the total vegetable oil production in 2016 (oil World, 2016). 

this shows the immense role of oil palm for the world’s vegetable oil 

consumption. the efficiency of oil palm’s yield cannot be rivaled by any 

other vegetable oil.

in 2017, according to the research from the research 

and market titled “the palm oil market: global industry 

trends, Share, Size, growth, oppurtunity and Forecast 

2018-2023”, the global palm oil market grew to around 

7% during 2010-2017. based on gapKi the production 

of palm oil in indonesia in 2017 reached 42 million 

tons; 32 million tons of it being exported while  11 mil-

lion tons was used domestically. 

as the demand for palm oil is expected to continue to 

grow in the coming years, Kencana understands that as 

new land developments for oil palm is becoming more 

difficult, we must push on to create oil palms that have 

higher productivity, more sustainable and produce 

better quality products to meet global market demand 

and maintain the sustainability of our environment.

For more details about our performance and business 

strategy discussion, please refer to the group’s 2017 

annual report.

Customer and Marketplace

Kencana serves both domestic and international mar-

kets such as malaysia, with supplies going to palm oil 

refiners, traders, brokers, oleochemical companies and 

fast-moving consumer goods companies (Fcgc). How-

ever, in 2017, all of our sales were dominated by domes-

tic sales due a more profitable domestic market. [102-6]

the group believes that keeping a positive and close 

relationship with our valued customers remains one 

of the keys to success. We assure customers that they 

are receiving nothing but the best by going on periodic 

site visits and continuous communication with buyers 

to receive more feedback. doing so enables us to tend 

to and solve any concerns in order to deliver products 

and service experience to our buyers.

in addition, the group safeguards customer privacy 

and meets all prevailing regulations regarding produc-

tion, distribution, and traceability. throughout 2017, 

there were no significant complaints from customers 

and marketplace authorities regarding the group's 

products, marketing communication practices or anti-

competitive behavior.

plantations. 14,295 ha of this total planted area is 

dedicated for our smallholders. based on 2017 figures, 

the group produced 591,471 and 167,422 tonnes of 

fresh fruit bunches (FFb) from the nucleus and plasma 

estates respectively. the total cpo produced in 2017 

was 147,716 tonnes, which was a 13% increment 

compared to 2016 production.

Sustainable Operations

the ability to manage our resources and making 

the most of what we have efficiently underlines our 

operations and will bring positive impacts on the 

environment and our stakeholders.

efficiency and better resource management will be 

achieved by continually optimizing the use of our 

resources including land, soil, water, fertilizers, seeds, 

etc. improving efficiency is beneficial for the group as 

we are able to minimize costs within our procurement 

department by better managing existing resources to 

run operations. We constantly attempt to improve our 

production by applying best management practices, 

replanting programs, efficient FFb transportation, and 

better tending of our crops in order to produce better 

yields as well as improving soil fertility. moreover, we 

focus on improving our effective water management 

systems, chemical spraying system as well as continual 

engineering improvement programs in order to reduce 

our carbon footprint within our daily operations.

in addition, we maintain and sustain our soil fertility 

by allowing the organic nutrients in biomass waste to 

return back into the soil. the use of legume cover crops 

protects soil integrity, conserves moisture, boosts 

nutrients and reduces soil surface runoff. the group 

maintains buffer zones in order to protect riparian 

areas and water quality.

practices (“gmp”) are applied and reflected within 

all of our Standard operating procedures (“Sop”). 

these include FiFo treatment for FFb, fulfillment of 

labour so that harvesting rotation is maintained, and 

minimizing mill breakdown hence FFa quality can be 

maintained.  the group also adopts the principles from 

both iSpo and iScc within our operations. to ensure 

that all companies that have attained iSpo and iScc 

certifications maintain their product quality, an iSpo 

surveillance audit is conducted yearly, while a re-

certification audit for iScc  also being conducted on a 

yearly basis. in compliance to iScc principles, all FFb 

products coming into and from pt. Sawindo Kencana 

are traceable to any of our stakeholders our ability to 

provide traceability guarantees that our cpo and FFb 

were produced in and by reputable sources.

Sustainable Product 

indonesian Sustainable palm oil organization 

(iSpo) certification standard is at the core of our 

sustainability strategy for all plantations that 

implemented at all plantations.

iSpo certification represents external acknowledge-

ment of our commitment in the implementation and 

compliance to all sustainable plantation require-

ments as mandated in the iSpo assessment criteria 

emphasizing on the following main aspects:

1. legality.

2. plantation management.

3. protection and utilization of primary Forest and 

peat land.

4. environment management.

5. responsibility for Workers.

6. Social responsibility &amp; economic environment.

7. Sustainable business improvement.

in addition, the group adopts iScc principles. the 

group collaborates with independent certification 

bodies in conducting iSpo and iScc principles imple-

mentation review and assessment, namely Sai global 

&amp; tuv nord.

in 2017, two of the group’s plantations have been suc-

cessfully awarded both iSpo and iScc certifications, 

namely pt. Sawindo Kencana and pt. alamraya Ken-

cana mas.

meanwhile, pt. agro inti Kencanamas and pt. Sawit 

Kaltim lestari have been audited for iSpo certifica-

tion and are awaiting for an announcement from the 

iSpo commission.

yearly surveillance audits were also carried out in 2017, 

in order to ensure that iSpo principles were imple-

mented thoroughly and properly at all plantations.

up to 2017, the group has achieved Sustainable 

palm oil certification from iScc for 22.34% of its 

eligible palm oil plantation area which represents 

12,111 hectares of plantation, equal to 44,446 tonnes 

of cSpo, and equivalent to 30% of the total cpo 

produced in 2017.

the year 2017 was an enthralling time to be an oil 

palm producer as global demand for food and fuel 

is constantly rising and yields per hectare of palm 

oil production are higher than that of any other oil 

producing crop. However, as the industry is still 

recovering from the effects of the el niño in 2016, the 

group is making the most of the resources, improve 

yields and productivity while minimizing the impacts 

on our environment.  

as we welcome better weather conditions in 

2017, Kencana continues to operate in the utmost 

responsible way as to preserve the environment in the 

best possible way. this notion has shaped the way we 

view our environmental surroundings and allows us 

to be more mindful of nature within our operations. 

although it is essentially managements’ decision to act 

sustainably, we are ultimately grateful to all employees 

who have embedded this notion and culture within 

their daily tasks. 

in 2017, the group continues to commit on our official 

Sustainable policy which took effect on 19 January 

2015. the policy and our commitment include improved 

environmental, community development &amp; Social 

impact, and Human rights &amp; Workplace management.

A. Environmental  

    Management Systems 

in order to enforce an effective management system, 

Kencana believes that maintenance and improvements 

of our sustainability environmental practices must 

always be in the back of our minds. thus the group 

adopts practices from the indonesian national 

company rating System (proper), indonesian 

Sustainable palm oil System (iSpo), and international 

Sustainability &amp; carbon certification (iScc). Since our 

plantations originated by developing land that has 

been leased and licensed to us by local governments, 

especially for the cultivation of palm oil as per 

indonesian law no. 5/1990, a majority of these lands 

are degraded and logged-over secondary forests. these 

lands are where we employ best agricultural practices 

based on iSpo, rSpo, iScc and gap standards.

iSpo and iScc both covers aspects of environmental, 

economic and social. While iScc consists of major 

and minor indicators, iSpo consists of 29 criteria and 

147 indicators that are compulsory to be adhered to. 

to achieve the required standards, Kencana commits 

to a number of actions that are rigorously monitored. 

routine assessments are conducted to review our 

compliance to the proper, iScc, and iSpo provisions. 

in 2017 a new milestone was reached as two companies, 

pt. Sawindo Kencana and pt. alamraya Kencana mas, 

both attained iSpo and iScc certifications. 

through this we aim to:

•	 achieve a minimum certification with blue proper 

rating across all our operations.

•	

attain an additional of two iSpo certificates by 2018, 

and subsequently iSpo certify all plantations with 

mills.

•	 continue to maintain and re-certify all iScc certified 

plantations and mills

•	 improve the plants yield the workers welfare.

calculator eu version 2.3). these gHg values were affected by the amount 

of fuel consumption, application of fertilizers, herbicides and chemicals 

used in both our plantation and mills. Some of our efforts to improve our 

environmental management systems to lower our gHg emmisions, are 

listed down as follows:

1. utilizing biomass to use as fertilizer and an alternative fuel substitute for 

generators and boilers as to reduce emissions from the use of fertilizers 

and diesel fuel in our estate and factories. 

2. monitoring the use of generators for housing electricity. Housings in 

estates are connected to the government grid whenever possible, thus 

reducing emissions from diesel generators. 

3. monitoring air quality every 6 months within our estate and mills 

area. For example, reporting on nox and Sox values found around our 

plantation and mills. under the indonesian government regulations, 

bml for nox and Sox values that needs to be met are 400 and 900 μg / 

nm3 respectively. based on these data, the average nox and Sox values 

are well under the bml. even though we are under the bml limit, we 

strive to keep lowering our air emissions to the best that we can.

B. Energy Consumption

Focusing on lowering the amount of energy consumption is imperative 

for the group to maintain its growth sustainably. as part of our corporate 

commitment to reduce the impact of emissions in the environment, the group 

seeks to implement the reapplication of biomass to support our production 

output. [103-1]

to lower energy consumption, the group’s estates must optimize the 

quality and the quantity of the FFb produced, hence resulting in a higher 

percentage of utilization in mills. 

in 2017, the average FFb yields were 13.8 tonnes (nucleus) and 13.00 tonnes 

(plasma) per hectare, while our oil extraction rate (“oer”) was 20.40%. 

this oer and FFb yield shows that the group’s growth potential is not yet 

fully realized as 53% of its nucleus oil palms are in the immature and young 

mature stage. this implies that the group’s current processed FFb derived 

mostly from 47% production of its prime mature oil palms (nucleus and 

plasma), which amounted to 723,966 tonnes of FFb in 2017. [103-2] 

From this amount of FFb, the mills were able to produce biomass fuel such 

as fibres and shells amounting to 141,066 tonnes, or 1,668,252 gigajoules 

of energy. this is equivalent to 14,609,892 kWh of generated electricity. in 

comparison to the total 17,221,974 kWh of electricity generated the biomass 

fuel accounts for 85% of the total generated electricity. [103-3][302-1]

C. Soil Fertility 

the quality of our soil plays an important role in attaining good palm 

oil yields. although the quality of soil is relative to the location of our 

plantation, we were able to make some improvements through effective 

management practices. vital nutrients are reintroduced to plantation soil 

through the mulching of empty fruit bunches, the use of cover crops, and 

the application of nitrogen-rich palm oil mill effluent: a fertilizer substitute. 

mulching suppresses weed growth, and cover crops conserve soil integrity 

and fertility, increase water retention, and reduce surface runoff.

in areas where our trees are planted on a sloped terrain, we build terraces and 

silt pits to minimize soil erosion and the leaching of fertilizers and pesticides into 

water bodies.

We preserve buffer zones between estates and rivers to protect riverbanks 

and maintain water quality.

in line with our Sustainability policy the group does not convert peat land in 

newly developed areas, even though the indonesian government regulation 

allows the development of peat land up to a depth of three meters. normally, 

the identification of peat land is determined during Hcv and/or HcS studies 

prior to new land conversion.

as part of the group’s effort in maintaining soil fertility, a yearly leaf Sampling 

unit (“lSu”) analysis is conducted to ensure soil fertility and fertilizers are 

accurately used throughout the plantation.

D. Water Usage

Water remains an essential element for the cultivation of oil palms and 

production activities. in order to ensure the sustainability of this important 

resource, the group carries out various initiatives that aim to ensure optimal 

water conditions, thereby creating an ideal environment for oil palm 

cultivation. the objective of the group's water system management is to 

prevent flooding, minimize erosion, and to secure the water supply for our 

plantation areas during the dry season. [103-1]

implementation of the group's water management systems has been 

designed with careful consideration and comprehensive hydrology, 

agronomy, and topography studies, as well as environmental and social 

impacts. the effectiveness and impact of the water management system, 

including its construction phase, have been carefully analyzed and evaluated. 

computer software modeling and simulation of the system were used, thus 

aiding the group in designing an optimal system for each particular area. 

throughout 2017, there were no reports or allegations regarding water 

supply or quality from any parties to the group. [103-2]

moreover, water gate systems in low laying areas, terracing system, and 

cover crops planting, were among of these efforts for creating a better 

environment for our trees. the comprehensive water system management 

enables accurate control and monitoring of water flow and level in our 

2017 Sustainability Report

plantation areas. Furthermore, water reservoirs were constructed to ensure 

medium and long-term availability of water. ideal land conditions and 

an effective water system management will enhance the effectiveness of 

fertilizers and natural organic nutrients absorbed by oil palms. [303-1]

throughout the year 1,172,446  m3 of water, sourced from nearby reservoirs 

and rivers in our estates, were used in the production process. this represents 

1.62 m3 of water per ton of cpo produced, showing an improvement of 

34% due to efficiencies within our water usage for production processes 

in comparison to last year. total water usage by the group consists of 60% 

from the reservoir and the remaining 40% from rivers surounding our estate 

areas. [303-1]

to further improve protection on our water bodies around the plantation, 

the group utilizes modified mobile water tanks that are used to fill knapsacks 

and mix chemicals prior to spraying activities take place. this ensures that 

no chemicals will contaminate any nearby streams, and prevent workers 

from collecting water with contaminated containers in water streams or 

creeks. therefore, our group's target is to reduce approximately 10% of 

water consumption in our mills and plantation in 2018 to ensure the good 

management of  water usage. [103-3]

E. Zero Burning

the group upholds a policy of zero burning for our operations. the group 

does not use fire for land clearing purposes. instead, we mechanically clear 

land and harness the organic contents within fallen decomposing biomass 

to replenish plantation soil. this provides a rich substrate for new plantings 

and reduce fertilizers application.

F. Waste Management

all plantation waste and production by-products are recovered and 

reused. empty fruit bunches are mulched, naturally returning nutrients to 

plantation soil. Shells and fiber also provide renewable boiler feedstock. 

recycling production and plantation waste as a fertilizer substitute reduces 

operational costs. in 2017, we recovered 143,408 million tonnes of empty 

fruit bunches which is an increase of 10% from the year 2016, and 617,878 

million m3 of effluents as processing waste which is also an increase of 6.8% 

from the previous year. [103-1][103-3]

efficient waste management plays an important role within our group 

to reduce the impact of environment pollution. aside from ensuring the 

sustainability of the environment, our waste management system also acts 

as a way to cut our operational costs. For example, by efficiently utilizing 

land application methods to supplement our palm oil trees, the group can 

increase our overall yields while at the same time cutting costs by using less 

chemical supplements. moreover, through the utilization of other biomass 

forms such as shells and fiber as a substitute for diesel, we can reduce the 

costs needed to run our boilers and generators. [103-2]

Hazardous waste produced as an outcome of our operations consists 

of  used lubricants, used rags, used batteries, used filters, empty paint 

cans and printer cartridges, and needles from health clinics. the waste 

produced at our site office amounts to less than 50kg each day, all of which 

are segregated, labeled and stored in a secure, fire resistant temporary 

storage facilities. our storage facilities are equipped with accidental spill 

containment kits, alarms, firefighting gears and first aid kits. 

the period of waste disposal relies on its type and category, with storage 

times ranging from 180-365 days. after being stored within its stipulated 

time and in accordance with hazardous waste management regulations, the 

waste would be taken away by a third party. the carrier would then issue a 

manifest of handling of hazardous waste transport which Kencana will use 

as proof to report to the ministry of environment and Forestry.

However, there are also cases where the group could recycle and reuse 

the waste output from our operations. in these cases, the waste would be 

stored for a total of 5 years. after that time has elapsed, the waste could be 

recycled into compost fertilizer that could be applied as an addition to our 

palm trees.

as mentioned earlier, proper hazardous waste management in accordance 

to the indonesian regulation is taken very seriously at Kencana. Hence, our 

Health and Safety officers at each site has been properly trained and are 

qualified to monitor and ensure that the waste management practices are 

in accordance with the rules.  

on the other hand, medical waste are disposed through the collaboration 

with local hospitals or “puskesmas” which will incinerate the waste safely. 

Facilities are inspected regularly by the regional environmental agency, 

and each plantation ensures that facility permits are up to date. in 2017 

each mill produced an average 10.4 tonnes of hazardous waste, of which 

around 78.5% comes from used lubricants. lastly, there were no reports of 

any chemical spillages in 2017. [306-2][306-3]

our palm oil mill effluent (“pome”) is treated in the group's Waste Water 

treatment plant through cooling ponds, mixing ponds, anaerobic ponds, 

and Settling ponds. in newer mills, the pome is treated in a multi-feeding 

waste water treatment system where only anaerobic bacteria are used. 

in 2017 we discharged 617,878 m3 of wastewater from 5 of our mills. the 

effluent quality is expressed using a median biological oxygen demand 

(bod) level of 1,273 mg/l, which is lower than the permittable bod level at 

5,000mg/l. We put into use all of our production pome as fertilizers back 

into the field on areas that have already been licensed for land application. 

it is important to note that the group does not discharge any of our pome 

into rivers. [103-3]

illustrated below is our biological oxygen demand (“bod”) level across our 

mills of the wastewater treatment outlets, with the water later used for land 

application. the group ensures that the bod level of effluents to be applied 

for land application is safely below the standard. [306-1]

even tough bod levels across all mills are already below allowable 

standards, we still ensure that ground water is not contaminated by 

installing monitoring wells. these wells are covered, locked and maintained 

regularly. representatives from the regional environmental agency inspect 

the quality of the water within the wells regularly as part of the proper 

assessment.

Having a bod value under the bml has been one of Kencana’s targets as 

having efficienrt waste management practices. the group will continue 

striving to improve its good liquid waste management system as to ensure 

that our waste value stays as low as possible. 

G. Reduction in Chemical Use

the use of agro-chemicals such as pesticides, fungicides and herbicides is 

unavoidable in the oil palm industry. However, we are aware of the needs 

to reduce excessive use of these agrochemicals to mitigate environmental 

damages that may be caused. as part of our commitment to reduce chemical 

usage, non-chemical pest control measures are preferred at all Kencana’s 

palm oil plantations, in particular through integrated pest management 

Systems designed to minimize use of chemicals by relying on biological and 

cultural alternatives. [103-1]

the spraying process is a very important stage within our production 

process. With this in mind, all workers responsible for spraying are required 

to undergo training on the use of personal protective equipment (ppe) 

as well as on the handling, use and storage of chemicals. the standard 

ppe uniform includes protective eye-wear, facial masks, rubber gloves 

and boots that have to be worn whenever the workers carry out their 

duties. these workers are also subject to regular check-ups to detect any 

internal presence of residual chemicals. to mitigate miscarriages or health 

complications, female sprayers who are pregnant are temporarily assigned 

other job responsibilities that are much less hazardous. training is essential 

for all new workers, while existing workers are required to undergo periodic 

refresher courses. [103-2]

Specifically for pt. SWK and pt. aKm, Kencana provides “rinse houses” 

where sprayers are required to store their knapsack, aprons, ppe and have 

a shower once they have completed their daily activities. Sprayers are also 

provided with portable water tanks where they are able to attain water and 

mix chemicals in a controlled environment. [103-3]

all chemicals are stored in locked facilities where only authorized personnel 

have access to them. there are also measures in place to prevent and 

respond rapidly to accidental spillage. containers previously used for 

storing chemicals are collected, stored and disposed of according to legal 

requirements.

H. Integrated Pest Management



integrated pest management is the practice of using a range of strategies 

to sustainably maintain pest populations within economic thresholds while 

causing minimal harm to local ecosystems. encouraging natural predators 

reduces pesticide application, and over the last two years we managed to 

reduce our use of chemical pesticides. [103-1][103-2]

oil palm pests include rats, rhinoceros beetles, bunch moths, bagworms, 

and nettle caterpillars. in order to organically and sustainably limit the 

presence of said pests, we breed owls to control rat populations, and 

encourage the predators of bagworms and caterpillars to flourish by 

planting turnerasubulata, turneraulmifolia, antigononleptopus, cassia 

tora, and nephrolepis. moreover, to control metisanaplana, a pesky 

caterpillar native to West and central Sulawesi region, the group cultivates 

turnerasubulata, turneraulmifolia, cassia tora, euphorbia heterophylla, 

and antigononleptopus which are planted at each block alongside palm oil 

crops. these plants contain nectar and pollen that serve as a food source for 

parasitoid insects and predators of the pest caterpillars, ultimately bringing 

pest populations under control. [103-3]

in 2017, pt. Sawindo Kencana’s owl (tyto alba) popula-

tion had increased to 101 adults, 11 juveniles and 94 

unhatched eggs. it has been estimated that one owl 

can cover a range of 30Ha. With a total of 101 adults, 

thus the owls are able to safeguard up to 3,030Ha.  

Since there are juveniles that are yet to become adults, 

the area coverage is likely to increase in 2018.

a new owl population is being developed in  

pt.  alamraya Kencana mas. at the end of the year, there 

were 35 barns with an estimate of 13 owls and 6 eggs in 

total. We expect the trend of cultivating owls to spread 

throughout our estates once the oil palm trees have 

reached a sufficient height for the birds to survive.

I. Nature Conservation [304-1]

understanding that the conservation of biodiversity is an important aspect 

of corporate responsibility, Kencana pushes to ensure that our operations 

are mindful of our plantations environmental surroundings. our efforts 

to remain environmentally responsible towards the conservation of 

biodiversity also acts as our compliance with the iSpo and iScc rules. 

the group believes that effective conservation is achieved through a 

combination of approaches. these include continual improvement of our 

High conservation value (Hcv) area monitoring efforts, internal capacity 

building, engagement with local communities and other oil palm plantation 

companies, as well as partnerships with academic and research institutions, 

ngos and governmental organizations. [103-1] [304-3]

the group has been protecting conservation areas since its inception, 

as well as following government regulations. Furthermore, to fulfill the 

requirement of conservation areas for certifications from iSpo, iScc, rSpo 

and others, the group conducts Hcv studies for all new development areas 

through accredited independent Hcv assessors. We are committed to 

preserve all conservation areas, maintaining habitats and not convert Hcv 

land into plantation. our commitment is evident in the increase of Hcv land 

area locations within the group. by the end of 2017, the group has identified 

18,081Ha of Hcv area. apart from our conservation studies the group has 

also conducted HcS studies. Keeping in mind that Kencana will continue 

ensuring that the Hcv areas are and will remain protected. [103-2][103-3]

in managing Hcv areas the group refers to a management strategy that 

focuses on these following key stages:

•	 preserve river border lines.

•	 cultivate local trees in Hcv area.

•	 educate the local community in the importance of preserving Hcv areas.

•	 regularly monitor river water quality.

•	 Hcv areas are regularly monitored and audited by the internal 

sustainability team.

•	 record every wildlife species found in the estates, and taking notes of 

those classified as vulnerable and above on the list of protected species 

under indonesian government regulation no. 7 of 1999 on preservation 

of Flora and Fauna.

2017 was a positive year for our community development program. Kencana 

believes that the advancement of our local community, both economically 

and socially, is essential for the sustainability of the group. Kencana has 

helped to improve the quality of life of the communities where we operate 

by enabling them to earn a more sustainable income for themselves, have 

better healthcare and education and help to maintain a better environment 

to live in through numerous programs.  [103-1]

ensuring that the local communities are well taken care of is very important 

for them to be more accepting of our business and operations within their 

area. Helping to improve their living standards enables them to trust us and 

allows us to have a better relationship with them. 

We support the responsible and peaceful resolution of conflicts that arise 

due to our operations. We believe in working with the relevant stakeholders 

through a process that is agreed upon by all appropriate parties. We are

Our

Plasma Partnership [203-1][203-2][413-1]

one of the group’s main community development goals is to support the 

growth of an independent and strong socio-economic condition, especially 

for the communities surrounding our operational sites. therefore, the 

plasma partnership program was initiated in 1997. through the plasma 

partnership, the group supports the development of an inclusive 

agribusiness which helps to improve the welfare and livelihood of the 

communities where we operate. [103-1][413-2]

our plasma partnership programs engaged by the group has produced a 

lot of positive social-economic impact for the farmers. among others, the 

plasma partnership program in pt SWK enables numerous individuals living 

below the poverty line to now live a simple yet enjoyable life where they 

could afford basic life necessities and some luxuries like a car, etc. a small 

village located near our plantation called tempilang, also became a part 

in the gradual positive changes brought by the program. the previously 

small, and almost unknown coastal village, is now buzzing with activities 

as monetary circulation has increased in the last two decades, coupled with 

the cultural event, ruahan, which tempilang hosts once a year. 

to date, our plasma planted area in bangka is over 70% of the total nucleus 

planted area, which is more than the 20% minimum required by the 

government. the group is supported by various stakeholders to conduct our 

plasma program, namely government, cooperatives, banks, and business 

partners. [103-2]

currently, our plasma program has engaged over 8,000 farmers from the 

local community with total plasma area of 14,295 ha. throughout 2017, 

Kencana’s plasma program managed to generate revenue of approximately 

idr 284.6 billion through FFb sales. moreover, the group provides technical 

training, quality seeds, advice on manuring application, and even new 

technologies and methodologies in oil palm cultivation. [103-3]

Kencana’s plasma partnership can be divided into three main programs, 

which are:

a. KKPA (Kredit Koperasi Primer untuk Anggota or 

Credit for Members of Primary Cooperative)

the KKpa program helps to provide funds for communities’ plantation 

development. We collaborate with banks and cooperatives. the group acts 

a the guarantor in this program. on top of that, we provide training and 

mentoring sessions for local farmer cooperatives and its members about 

good agricultural practices, administratition, cooperative management, 

basic financial management, and more.

b. KKSR (Kebun Kelapa Sawit Rakyat or Community’s 

Oil Palm Plantation)

the KKSr program is a joint collaboration program with the local gov-

ernment aiming to empower local communities and help them to im-

prove their welfare through the utilization of uncultivated lands in the 

region which are owned by the government as palm oil plantation. the 

group takes an active role together with the government in this program 

by offering a purchase guarantee of the KKSr plantation output as our 

raw material.

c. Revitbun (Revitalisasi Perkebunan or Plantation 

Revitalization)

revitbun is a national program initiated by the indonesian government 

to help accelerate the growth of local plantations through expansion, re-

vitalization, rehabilitation of various commodity crops, including palm 

oil and corn. in this program, the group works together with the govern-

ment and provide our expertise to help develop plantation areas, cul-

tivation, agronomy practices and technology, production process and 

product marketing for the local farmers/communities, while the govern-

ment provides investment loan.

Empower Remote Indigenous Communities 

[103-2][103-3] 

initially called orang rintis or commonly the mountain people, are 

indigenous people who live scattered within the mountains of tempilang, 

bangka. they live by way of farming (planting pepper), hunting, and fishing. 

due to their genetic pool, the people of pelaik have distinctive posture. they 

stand at an average of 1.3 meters in height. [103-1]

in early 1996 the Social department of South Sumatra began a project to put 

together the community in one area. those who were willing to settle were given 

facilities in a form of a house, and land as much as 2 hectares. various ways 

in which the ministry of Social affairs tried to ensure the community can be 

independent and no longer mobile, starting with providing seeds for rice and 

corn. However, the community preferred to return to their usual way of life.  

Within the same year, another effort was made when the Social department 

of South Sumatra issued a letter of recommendation on the ‘development of 

Social Welfare of remote communities’, together with pt. Sawindo Kencana 

(SWK) to help the mountain people in an oil palm smallholder project. the 

project was initiated in village called pelaik. more than 100 families were 

recorded in pelaik, and 94 of them were willing to become smallholder oil 

palm farmers with pt.SWK. it is now has been more than 22 years since the 

project initiated, and the villagers’ life are much better. their houses which 

were originally made with boards and rumbia (metroxylon sagu) are now 

permanent buildings made with concrete. access paths that were originally 

only accessible by foot, are now paved roads. most of the villagers’ children 

are now also in schools, some have even gone to universities.

the economic condition of the mountain people in pelaik has improved con-

siderably since pt. SWK initiated its cSr program in a form of smallholder 

cooperation, bringing people out of poverty, and keeping them in touch of 

the changes in the modern world. the smallholder cooperative of pt. SWK, 

bina tani Sejahtera (btS) believes that the program shall be sustainable 

and continuous for years to come.  

through this community empowerment program, pt SWK's commitment 

to improve the welfare of the community around its business unit is in line 

with the work program of the government of the republic of indonesia as 

stipulated in the regulation of the minister of Social affairs of the republic 

of indonesia no. 6 of 2016 in which prioritize those who are in poverty, ne-

glected, disabled, remote, exploited and discriminated. as a form of appre-

ciation, the government of indonesia rewarded pt. SWK with the padmami-

tra award in 2017, which is the most prestigious form of appreciation given 

by the Social ministry, for private companies who have contributed to social 

and environmental programs.

pt. SWK believes that by receiving this award, it could encourage and inspire 

not only other estates within Kencana, but also other oil palm business ac-

tors to accelerate the realization of Program Indonesia Sejahtera by 2025.

Educating The Public  

On The Importance of Oil Palm

in 2017, palm continues to become the leading vegetable oil in terms of 

production volume and consumption. indonesia, together with malaysia, 

were the top palm oil producers, and it has been so for many years. Kencana 

believes as part of the palm oil industry, we are obliged to educate the 

world on the importance of palm oil within the current world’s vegetable oil 

demand, and the ripple effects that it has on the surrounding communities. 

thus, in 2017, the group focused our cSr program on educating the 

community, and reaching out farther than before.

together with agency for Funding of oil palm plantations (bpdp-KS), in 2017 

Kencana invited 25 companies from various mass media, including cnn, 

info SaWit, media perkebunan, Hortus, Kompas, tempo, Koran Jakarta, 

Jakarta post, rcti, media indonesia, Kumparan, berita Satu, bisnis.com 

among others. 

in addition to the rampant negative news surrounding the recent palm oil 

industry, this project also aims to inform and educate both the media, and 

their listeners, to understand further about the oil palm plantation industry. 

the project began in april 2017, where the media crews were invited to 

tour the plantations and palm oil mill, to see the processing flow from FFb 

to become cpo. after the tour, the journalists were given a chance to see 

one of the plasma cooperatives in pt. SWK, bina tani Sejahtera (btS). in 

this occasion, Head deputy of btS, arizal efendi conveyed, “the symbiosis 

of mutualism that occurred between pt SWK &amp; btS cooperation has been 

ongoing since the beginning of pt SWK in 1996. now, the area of btS plasma 

field has reached over 3,700 hectares with a number of 1,115 households.”

From this project, the media is gradually beginning to understand the role of 

the oil palm plantation industry for both indonesia and the world. our world 

is still heavily dependent on palm oil, as it is the most efficient vegetable oil, 

and its derivatives being utilized in many household products around the 

world. no other vegetable oil has the yield like palm oil. Kencana believes 

that this project shall continue for the years to come, to help educate the 

people.

Hand-in-hand with NGO and Researchers

in 2016, Kencana together with dr arya Hadi dharmawan, director of 

Study program of rural Sociology of the graduates School in institut 

pertanian bogor university (ipb), agreed to work together to better improve 

our sustainability program. in doing so, the group collaborated with a 

consortium of Swiss funded research group named oil palm adaptive 

landscape team (opal). Within the group there are representatives from 

WWF indonesia, etH Zürich, center for international Forestry research, and 

Swiss national Funded Science Foundation. 

the project initiated with a desktop study, involving the community 

development department in Kencana Head office. the opal team then 

conducted a 4 day site visit in Kutai Kartanegara and was invited to see 

3 estates. the research group emphasized their visit on Hcv areas, cSr 

programs, plasma programs, learning facilities for children, and how the el 

niño has affected the oil palms, as well as understanding the challenges of 

sustainable expansion of oil palm agriculture and the implementation of 

reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (redd) initiatives 

in the tropics. the group visited 7 cooperatives built by Kencana, and a 

number of cSr programs in the muara Kaman district, Kutai Kartanegara. 

one of the cSr programs which they looked into, was the clean water project 

in Sabintulung village. the group built a water treatment unit measuring 4 

x 4m, with a height of 2m, and 2 reverse osmosis units that treat the nearest 

river water into drinkable water. the water treatment program ensures a 

flow of clean water for the village all year round. meanwhile, in terms of 

education, the team also looked at how Kencana has helped children by 

providing extra teachers at schools, fulfillment of student learning facilities, 

and scholarships. 

among the guests, there were a number of phd students majoring in both 

environmental and social. this program is not only intended to improve 

sustainability development in oil palm plantations, but it shall also help bring 

awareness of the multiplier effects in an oil palm plantation and its surrounding 

communities, around the world. this ongoing project is expected to continue

 the program is an ongoing project, both opal and Kencana are continuously 

learning from one another.

Our  

PeOPle

the oil palm industry is often seen as an industry that is heavily 

dominated by men. there are perceptions that women are 

not able to handle much of the jobs within this industry. that 

view is certainly denied by reni mauliana, who works in one 

of Kencana’s subsidiaries. reni currently serves as the head of 

civil and transport in Kalimantan Selatan estate. She has been 

with Kencana for over 10 years, and has proved to many men 

that sometimes the delicate touch of women is an advantage. 

reni is in charge of all the civil works and heavy equipments in 

the estate. usually this is perceived as a men’s world job. but 

reni states that “the limitation of someone’s work is only in his 

mind.” 

apart from reni, there is also novera who has been working in 

Kencana’s estate in bangka since 1997. She started off as being 

in the field, then moving up to become head of the estate’s 

office. Her job certainly comes with challenges, many which 

will trouble most men. However, novera proves that women 

are entitled to get a work position in accordance with their 

achievements regardless of gender.      

in order to become a sustainable agribusiness, we need to produce high 

yields both within the estates and mills. to do so, we must manage our 

people, and produce successors of champions through training, evaluation, 

engagement, and fair remuneration. Kencana believes that our employees 

satisfaction and good health is directly linked to our productivity.

Furthermore, the group aims to achieve zero accident, because we believe 

that even one accident or injury is one too many. thus, our pristine health 

and safety policies and practices are designed to provide a safe workplace 

for all our employees. one of the ways we achieve this is by ensuring health 

and safety standards through SmK3 education to raise awareness amongst 

our workers.

1. enforcing strict procedures for the use of all person-

al protective equipment.

2.  Safety procedures for contractors and guests. 

3.  First aid response to accidents. 

4.  Work safety inspections. 

5.  Waste and chemical management. 

6.  emergency action plan and response for the occur-

these policies are continuously being developed and 

monitored by the group's management in order to 

protect the rights of our employees and to provide 

a healthy working space for those employed by 

Kencana. along with protecting our workers HSe 

rights, we also aim to be mindful of the environment to 

keep it in its pristine condition. ensuring our workers 

rights and preserving the environment surrounding 

our operational areas is one of our most valuable 

investments. [103-2]

as part of the group’s  commitment in Health and Safety 

we continue to elevate the quality of our facilities 

across the regions and increasing the number of HSe 

officers every year. From 2016 to 2017, there was a 60% 

increased in the number of certified HSe officers within 

the group. [103-3]

our HSe officers are responsible to monitor the 

implementation of our policy and Sop. to ensure 

this implementation are carried out successfully and 

controlled in a sound manner, our HSe officers have a 

Work program which they have to follow:

to ensure the health of our workers and their family, 

all estates are either equipped with a health facility on 

site in a form of a clinic, or has a collaboration with a 

puskesmas (health centre) in the nearest village. each 

estate with a clinic is also equipped with an ambulance. 

estates that have clinics on site also cooperates with 

the nearest puskesmas in case there are referrals and 

treatments that cannot be treated at the clinics. each 

clinic is led by a paramedic and is assisted by several 

nurses that are HiperKeS certified (company Hygiene 

and occupational Health). a doctor from the nearest 

puskesmas also conducts regular visit, thus patients 

treated at the clinic get proper care.

aside from this the group cooperates with a 3rd party to 

conduct health assessments in a form of cholinesterase 

test for workers who are exposed to chemicals in their 

daily routine, and hearing loss test for workers who 

work in noisy working environment such as engine 

rooms.  Women who work with chemicals also receive 

pregnancy tests yearly, to ensure that no pregnant 

women are working while being exposed to chemicals. 

in 2017, the group recorded  Zero Fatality. However, 

to maintain this in the long run the group has eight 

certified occupational Health and Safety (aK3 umum) 

officers scattered across the regions to ensure the

safety of our workers. to prevent accidents, all officers 

implement oHS management system that is inline with 

the local regulations, including hazard identification, 

risk management and assessment. trainings such 

as first aid practices and emergency responses are 

conducted regularly across all estates and mills, 

including making certain all workers are equipped with 

ppe and worn at all time during working hours. 





Our Employees

the group’s HSe officers are responsible to monitor all 

work accidents and summarize them monthly. in one 

of our estates, pt. Sawindo Kencana, the severity rate 

in 2017 is at 111.33. that indicates, within 1,000,000 

working hours in one year, pt Sawindo Kencana has 

lost 111.33 hours. all Health and Safety work program 

reports from each site are sent to the Sustainability 

department to be verified and evaluated.  [404-1]

in 2017 we employed 6,540 individuals, 2,494 of those 

being local workers while 4,046 individuals employed 

are non local. in 2017, around 62% of our workers 

are non local. the high numbers of non locals can be 

seen in the Kalimantan estates. in Kalimantan, the 

competition within the oil palm industry increases 

every year. as we know the oil palm industry is very 

labour incentive, while there are workers within the 

local area who are willing to work, the number is not 

sufficient to cater all companies throughout the region. 

thus, to fulfill the number of workers needed, non 

locals must be recruited. [102-8][103-3][405-1]

in 2017 we began a new ‘execution culture’ to be 

performed by every single member within our 

organization, from the workers within the field right 

up to the directors. the aim of this program is to  start 

a new culture where workers are able to execute their 

work plan accordingly. Hr will review the progress of 

each department’s execution to achieve the set-out 

goal. this execution culture implementation will be 

fully active by 2018. [103-1][103-2]

and with dignity. our employees have the freedom 

to join an association and to bargain collectively We  

respect  the  right  of  all  our  employees to join and 

form associations  of  their  choice  and to  collective  

bargaining. each subsidiary and its labour union 

representatives have agreed upon a collective labour

agreement that aims to protect employees’ and 

employers’ rights and obligations. all our employees 

are protected by the collective labour agreement, 

which covers industrial relations, working hours, 

remuneration, out-of-post assignments and transfers, 

social security and welfare, occupational health and 

safety, and employment termination. the rights of our 

employees have been socialised and are written within 

the group’s regulations. in order to continuously have 

good working conditions for all staff and employees, 

Kencana enables employees to express their complaints 

by filing a letter of grievance. Filing this letter ensures 

that their supervisors are aware of their concerns. once 

a letter is filed, the employees superior would get in 

touch with them at a private meeting to further discuss 

their complaint and provide solutions that is agreeable 

to both parties. [102-41][103-1][103-2][103-3][407-1]

measures taken to support these rights, among others, 

where by the employee can use grievance form to 

convey their aspirations to their superior. the superior 

then will directly address the employee's aspiration. 

[103-2]

Freedom of association is very important to ensure 

our employees can state and express their grievances 

transparently and solve the problem with the group in 

an appropriate way. [407-1]

Diversity and Inclusion  

[103-1][103-2] [103-3][405-1]

a diverse and inclusive workforce with strong team 

work makes us a more competitive player within 

the palm oil business. We believe in equal treatment 

amongst genders, nationalities and age groups within 

the workplace. this is achieved by ensuring that equal 

opportunities exist for all and do not tolerate discrimi-

nation on any grounds.  

this commitment is also reflected in the composition of 

our board of  directors as described below.

Child Labours

the group has a strict policy to uphold the ban on child 

labour and do not employ anyone under the age of 

18 years old. We seek to prevent any mistreatment of 

children as is written within our Sustainability policy. as 

a form of our effort in ensuring the implementation of 

the policy by ensuring all workers recruited by Kencana 

agri must show their identity card in the initial process 

of recruitment. While the parents are working, the group 

provides daycare centres and a kindergarten to ensure 

their children’s safety and wellbeing, and at the same 

time preventing parents from bringing children to the 

workplace. [103-1][103-2][103-3][408-1]

Remuneration 

one of our main commitments to our people is to pro-

vide them with the best of our abilities. this of course 

includes their earnings. our entry level permanent em-

ployee wages amounts to at least at the local minimum 

wage rate (umr), with the total average of 1.58 times 

above umr across our area of operations. For our non-

permanent employees, we apply minimum wage ac-

cording to the regulation from each region, since the 

minimum wage in indonesia differ from one province to 

another. [103-1][103-2]

Here at Kencana, we highlight the importance of fairness 

and equality throughout our whole organization and 

give fair opportunities based on their competence, 

regardless of their race, religion, or gender.  this is why 

we give equal chances with equal wages strictly based on 

the umr and personal competency and/or achievement. 

However, there are no differences between male and fe-

male entry level income since both genders would receive 

wages either equal to or higher than the government 

regulation. although unnecessary to pay higher than the 

rate determined by the umr, our investment in our peo-

ple enlightens us as they have better living standards. 

With this, the total renumeration paid to our employees in 

2017 amounted to approximately idr 128.5 billion. [103-3]
