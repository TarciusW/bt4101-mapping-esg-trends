ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited reaffirms our 

commitment to sustainability, with the publication of 

our third standalone Sustainability Report prepared in 

accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) 

Standards: Core option. 

The report focusses on topics which have been 

deemed as material to ComfortDelGro’s businesses 

and key Stakeholders, based on the economic, 

environmental and social impact caused by our 

everyday activities. A Materiality Test was conducted 

in FY2015 and the assessment has been reviewed 

internally and remains valid. 

Your feedback is welcome and you can reach us at 

sustainability@comfortdelgro.com.

Reporting Period and Scope 

This Sustainability Report articulates ComfortDelGro’s 

strategies and practices in all aspects of sustainability, 

and provides a detailed account of our sustainability 

performance in all our operations around the world. It is 

based on the Group’s financial year from 1 January to 31 

December 2017 and is produced annually. 

As SBS Transit and VICOM are also listed  

on the Singapore Exchange, we have produced  

their figures separately in this Sustainability Report. 

This Sustainability Report supplements 

ComfortDelGro’s Annual Report 2017, which  

can be found on our corporate website  

www.comfortdelgro.com. It underscores our 

commitment to keep all Stakeholders – Customers, 

Employees, Investors, Business Partners, 

Regulators and Community members – abreast of 

efforts and developments in the field of Corporate 

Social Responsibility. In accordance with our efforts 

to be more environmentally friendly, this Report is 

only available in the CD which also contains our full 

Annual Report and on our website.

Independent Consultancy 

An independent Sustainability consulting firm, 

Paia Consulting, was appointed to provide external 

assistance with the development of the contents 

of this Report, in line with the GRI Standards. We 

intend to seek external assurance in the future.

STATEMENT BY THE BOARD

Sustainability is a key pillar of the 

Group’s overall strategy and one that 

the Board pays close attention to. In 

particular, we consider environmental, 

social and governance (ESG) issues as 

part of our strategic formulation.

STATEMENT 

BY THE BOARD

2  ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited


Our global sustainability strategy focusses 

on three key areas: our products, our 

planet and our people. 

Being in the land transport business, 

we are cognisant that the delivery of 

our services has a direct impact on the 

environment. To this end, we have, and 

continue to, work closely with Regulators 

as well as vehicle manufacturers and 

suppliers to reduce our overall carbon 

footprint. We are encouraged by the 

advancement of technology and are 

keeping close tabs on developments in the 

field of Green technology. We are already 

operating hybrid buses and taxis, and 

have been working with manufacturers 

and Regulators on electric vehicle trials. 

Certainly, technological advancements will 

have a significant impact on the way we 

operate and our environmental footprint.

Our people, and the people we serve,  

is another area of focus. From the health 

and safety of our employees to the  

support for the socially disadvantaged, we 

are constantly looking at ways to improve. 

Our employees are committed to projects 

and activities that contribute to society 

and help protect the environment. 

ESG matters as determined by our 

Stakeholders and deemed to be material 

to value creation are integrated into 

our balanced scorecard, which is used 

to set objectives, drive behaviours, 

measure performance and determine 

remuneration. The Board has reviewed 

and approved  the material issues, and 

has delegated the management and 

monitoring to Senior Management. 

For more information on our 

approach to sustainability, please refer 

to page 41.

Corporate governance is also 

something that the Board watches 

closely. As a company that conducts 

business on a global scale, we are 

committed to nurturing a corporate 

culture that encourages employees to 

act ethically and with a strong sense 

of mission in meeting the needs of 

customers and in ensuring transparent 

management and fair decision-

making. In this regard, the adoption 

of the corporate auditor system has 

helped us increase the effectiveness 

of the auditing and monitoring 

functions fulfilled by Auditors. 

Moreover, we are enhancing the 

management oversight function of the 

Board of Directors by implementing 

appropriate measures such as 

reviewing the terms of reference of all 

Board Committees. 

For more information on corporate 

governance, please refer to pages 48 

to 67 in the ComfortDelGro Annual 

Report 2017.

on issues to focus on for long-term 

sustainability. An in-depth materiality 

assessment based on internal and 

external stakeholder expectations 

was conducted in 2015. 

The issues that have been 

identified as material to us are 

environmental and social issues that

operations, or could substantively 

influence the assessments and 

decisions of our Stakeholders. Based 

on international best practices, we 

have made an initial prioritisation of 

the issues using the internationally 

accepted AccountAbility 5-Part 

Materiality Test model, embedded in 

the AA1000 standard. 

The materiality assessment 

involved ComfortDelGro’s Senior 

Management as well as External 

Stakeholders. Their rating is shown 

in the diagram provided. The Board 

has reviewed and approved the 

material issues, and has delegated 

the management and monitoring to 

Senior Management.

Accessibility

As a provider of land transport 

services, accessibility is a critical 

part of our business focus. We are 

committed to providing our services 

equitably to serve all customers – 

independent of age or ability. To this 

end, we invest extensively in systems, 

processes and new technologies 

including wheelchair-accessible 

and low-floor buses. We are also 

committed to making our workplace 

accessible to our employees. For 

example, ramps and lift access as well 

as wheelchair-accessible restrooms 

are available at a number of our 

buildings both locally and overseas.

Anti-Corruption 

Business and ethical integrity are 

pillars of our corporate psyche. The 

ComfortDelGro Group does not 

tolerate corruption in any part of its 

business. Our fight against corruption 

is guided by the following principles:

• 

 The ComfortDelGro Group shall 

not participate in or endorse any 

corrupt practices. 

• 

 Representatives of the Group 

shall not offer customers, 

potential customers, suppliers, 

consultants, governments, 

agencies of governments, or any 

representative of such entities, any 

rewards or benefits in violation 

of applicable laws or established 

business practices stricter than 

applicable laws, in order to obtain 

or retain business or to gain any 

other improper advantage. 

• 

 Our employees shall not accept 

payments, gifts or other kinds 

of reimbursement from a third 

party that could affect or appear

to affect their objectivity in their 

business decisions.

• 

 We believe in full transparency 

and according equal treatment to 

all existing and potential suppliers.

Diversity and  

Non-Discrimination

ComfortDelGro embraces diversity. 

We believe in creating an inclusive 

environment where our employees 

treat each other equally, honestly and 

with respect. We want to nurture a 

culture where diverse perspectives 

can help drive our Group forward. 

We strive to provide a fair and 

supportive work environment for 

all our employees, regardless of 

their age, sex, marital status, sexual 

orientation, disability, race, colour, 

nationality, ethnic or national origin, 

religion, or affiliation to any political 

party or trade union. We aim to 

employ people who reflect the 

diverse nature of society and we 

value each of our employees for 

the contribution they make, both 

individually, and as part of the Group.

Our policy applies to recruitment 

and selection, terms and conditions 

of employment including pay, 

promotion, training, transfer, 

references and every other aspect 

of employment.

Economic Performance

ComfortDelGro believes in creating 

long-term economic value for 

our Shareholders as well as the 

key Stakeholders by adopting 

responsible business practices and 

growing the business in a sustainable 

manner. Details of the Group’s 

economic performance for 2017 can 

be found in our Annual Report 2017.

Employee Training

ComfortDelGro invests continually 

in its employees to develop their 

skills and talent. We ensure that 

employees understand their 

responsibilities and are given access 

to necessary training to equip them 

to do their jobs better.

While most of the material issues are 

relevant to all our Business Units, issues 

like Public Policy, Accessibility and Local 

Communities are most relevant for our 

bus and train businesses. Environmental 

material issues are of highest significance 

for our bus, train and taxi businesses.

Environmental Impacts:  

Energy Use and Air Emissions, 

Water Consumption and 

Waste Management

The ComfortDelGro Group is 

committed to managing and 

minimising the impact of our 

business operations on the 

environment, including our supply 

chain. Our commitment to the 

environment is steadfast. Whether 

it is the vehicles we run or the 

buildings we operate in, we are 

committed to ensuring that our 

Green Quotient is kept high.

We endeavour to continue  

to improve the management of  

our environment impacts by 

reducing resource usage and 

minimising waste. We are firmly 

committed to investing in new, more 

environmentally friendly vehicles, so 

as to reduce our emissions footprint.

Health &amp; Safety

As a land transport Group, 

managing the health and safety of 

our customers, our employees and 

the public is not just a priority, it is a 

necessity. With over 42,500 vehicles 

plying the roads in seven countries, 

we have in place stringent checks, 

systems and processes to ensure 

that health and safety is never 

compromised. Safety requirements 

are incorporated in tender 

documents for relevant products 

and services. We have also invested 

heavily in training and re-training 

courses, and run safety awareness 

and training programmes to  

instill a safety and security 

conscious culture in employees  

at all levels. This safety focus 

continues to be strongly reflected 

in the Group’s policies, procedures 

and training. 

Labour-Management Relations, 

Employee Engagement

Our people are undoubtedly our 

most valuable asset. Without them, 

we would not be where we are today. 

Indeed, we strongly subscribe to the 

view that a happy and motivated 

workforce will ultimately translate into 

happy and satisfied customers. In the 

long run, this can only result in growth 

for the organisation. 

To this end, we provide equal 

opportunities to our staff, invest in 

comprehensive training to develop 

them to their maximum potential  

and engage them actively in what  

we do. Significantly, as an employer,  

we ensure that all terms and conditions 

of employment, along with policies  

and procedures, comply with  

relevant regulations. 

Local Communities

ComfortDelGro is committed to 

community contribution in all the 

regions we operate in. We actively 

reach out in various areas including 

education, welfare, disaster relief and 

health. Community engagement forms 

an important part of our business 

not only because it breeds trust and 

familiarity, but because it gives a 

human face to the business. We also 

find that our employees tend to be 

happier when they feel that they have 

made a difference in the lives of others. 

Public Policy and  

Regulatory Framework

ComfortDelGro engages with 

Governments at many different 

levels to help shape public policy and 

regulations that support the land 

transport sector. We also work closely 

with Regulators, Association Partners 

and Unions on issues which affect our 

business and our Stakeholders.

THE GREEN STATEMENT

The ComfortDelGro Group of Companies aims to minimise the impact of 

its activities on the environment by ensuring continuous improvement in 

environmental performance whilst bearing in mind prevailing technical 

and operational constraints. The Group is also committed to complying 

with all statutory and regulatory requirements. 

Our overall goal in environmental management is to minimise the 

harmful effects of our operations across Singapore, the United Kingdom, 

Ireland, China, Australia, Vietnam and Malaysia on the environment. By 

striving to reduce the environmental footprint of each passenger journey, 

ComfortDelGro can contribute to reductions in air pollution from road 

transport and carbon dioxide emissions. A complete elimination of harmful 

emissions is, however, not possible and we will explore how best we can 

offset any negative impact we have on the environment.

We endeavour to continue to improve the management of our 

environmental impacts by reducing resource usage and minimising waste. 

We will continue to make ongoing investments in new vehicles so as to 

reduce our emissions profile and we will continue to support research into 

alternative fuels.

THE GREEN 

STATEMENT

8  ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited


• 

 Manage our carbon footprint and energy 

consumption through the use of technology, 

process improvements, energy optimisation and 

other efficiency measures; and

• 

 Adopt plans and measures throughout our 

operations and infrastructure to mitigate the 

longer term risks of climate change.

These goals and strategies are clearly outlined and 

displayed in all our offices to motivate our staff. 

ENVIRONMENT

The ComfortDelGro Group is committed to minimising 

the environmental impact of its operations. In fact, the 

very nature of a large part of our business is to try to 

steer communities away from the use of private cars. 

Indeed, studies have found that public transport, on 

average, consumes 3.4 times less energy per passenger 

kilometre than automobiles. This ratio is even more 

favourable during rush hour.

As we reinforce our commitment to the environment, 

we have set a short-term target of reducing carbon 

emissions by 1 to 3% over the next one to three years.

We endeavour to continue to improve the 

management of our environmental impact by 

reducing resource usage and minimising waste. 

We are firmly committed to investing in new, more 

environmentally friendly vehicles, so as to reduce our 

emissions footprint.

We effectively manage energy efficiency, air 

emissions, waste and water consumption. Our 

environmental policy has been implemented for 

close to a decade under the supervision of our 

Green Committee, involving Senior Management 

and all relevant Business Units/Central Functions. 

ComfortDelGro compiles the necessary data and 

reviews its performance regularly, deciding on and 

implementing improvement measures.

Our longer term environmental goals are:

• 

 To improve our emissions profile per passenger 

journey and per passenger kilometre;

• 

 To reduce waste and to increase the proportion 

of waste reused/recycled;

• 

 To improve the environmental management 

standards across the Group;

• 

 To continue to encourage and promote the use 

of public transport so as to ensure a modal shift 

away from car use;

• 

 To continue to support initiatives on research and 

trial the use of alternative fuels;

• 

 To continuously work at inculcating and 

strengthening the Green Culture amongst the staff.

To achieve this, we will:

• 

 Identify, assess and actively manage all material 

aspects of our environmental impact;

• 

 Continually improve the environmental 

performance and minimise impact through 

resource and energy management and 

pollution prevention;

Our London operations are leading the charge in the 

zero emissions race. From 2018, new ComCab taxis in 

London must be zero emission capable. There will be no 

more new diesel taxis and private hire cars, which are 

licensed for the first time in 2018, must be hybrids or have 

Euro 6-standard engines. And by 2020, all new private hire 

cabs must be capable of running solely on battery power. 

Vehicle Emissions Profile

ComfortDelGro has always been among the first 

adopters of the Government’s Green Policies in 

deploying suitable vehicles for service in support of 

the environment. All over the world, we are converting 

our fleets to higher standards, with hybrids and electric 

vehicles. In all, Green vehicles make up slightly more 

than half of our over 42,500-strong vehicles worldwide.

For the year ended 31 December 2017, our major 

bus, taxi and rail businesses in Singapore, Australia and 

the UK registered carbon emissions of about 1,301,688 

metric tonnes1. ComfortDelGro targets to reduce the 

emissions in 2018 by 13,016 tonnes or the equivalent of 

close to 3,000 passengers cars’ emissions in a year2. We 

will be including emissions data from China for the next 

reporting cycle.

Sustainability Report 2017  9


In Singapore, ComfortDelGro Taxi, which is 

Singapore’s largest taxi operator with 13,340 

vehicles, targets to convert at least half of its fleet 

to Euro 6 and above by 2020. In 2017, we have 

increased the number of Euro 5 Hyundai i-40 taxis 

from 7,050 to 8,108. The Toyota Prius hybrid taxi 

which runs on both electricity and petrol, and added 

to the fleet in 2016, also increased from 201 to 1,250 

in 2017.

These environmentally friendly taxis serve 

alongside the Euro 6 Mercedes Benz E220 

BlueTEC LimoCabs. The 150 limousines come with 

Adblue tanks that help reduce harmful emissions 

by transforming 90% of the nitrogen oxide into 

environmentally friendly gases such as water and 

nitrogen. They also emit only 124g of carbon per 

kilometre compared to 129g/km for the Euro 5 and 

132g/km for the older Euro 4 models. 

The carbon emissions from the newer fleet with 

better emissions, are shown below:

• 

Euro 4 Hyundai Sonata – 184g/km

• 

Euro 5 Hyundai i-40 – 159g/km

• 

Toyota Prius – 97g/km

As at December 2017, our taxi fleet in Singapore 

comprised 27.5% Euro 4 taxis, 61.2% Euro 5 taxis, 

1.8% Euro 6 taxis, and 9.4% hybrid taxis.

From 1 September 2017, petrol vehicles in Singapore 

need to meet the Euro 6 emission standards, up from 

Euro 4 previously, whereas from 1 January 2018, 

diesel vehicles will need to meet the Euro 6 emission 

standards, up from Euro 5 currently. Together with 

the changes, the National Environment Agency 

(NEA) also introduced the Vehicular Emissions 

Scheme (VES) with effect from 1 January 2018 to 

replace the current Carbon Emissions-Based Vehicle 

Scheme (CEVS) for all new cars, taxis and newly 

imported used cars registered from 1 January 2018 

to 31 December 2019. 

The VES rebate surcharge for a car or taxi will be 

determined by its worst-performing pollutant and 

car buyers will be encouraged to choose models 

that have lower emissions across all criteria - so as 

to further improve ambient air quality and, in turn, 

public health.

In line with this, our listed subsidiary, VICOM  

has added Euro 6 and JPN 2009 into its scope of 

emission tests. 

It also helps to demonstrate the importance of 

regular vehicle inspections to road users and our 

Regulators globally which in turn helps to ensure that 

vehicles comply with the fuel emission standards.

In China, we invest in dual-fuelled taxis that 

run on both Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) 

and petrol. Over 70% of the fleet in China are 

environmentally friendly CNG vehicles. Nanjing 

ComfortDelGro Dajian Taxi operates a total of 679 

CNG driven taxis while Chengdu ComfortDelGro 

Taxi operates a total of 488 CNG driven taxis. 

Nanning Comfort Transportation converted 283 

taxis from single energy to dual energy cars in 

January 2017 and replaced 130 single energy cars 

with dual energy cars in June 2017. By using dual 

energy vehicles, it helps drivers manage their fuel 

costs and also help cut down on harmful emissions.

In a project supported by the Beijing Municipal 

Government, Beijing Jin Jian Taxi Services 

replaced the auto three-way catalytic converters 

in all its taxis to minimise the emissions footprint. 

The converter will be replaced with new ones 

every two years as part of preventive maintenance 

initiative.

As a member of Australia’s Roads and Traffic 

Authority Clean Fleet Programme, ComfortDelGro 

Corporation Australia (CDC) is committed to 

providing fleet maintenance that meets regulatory 

requirements. In 2017, CDC added another 27 

Euro 5 and one Euro 6 Environmentally Efficient 

Vehicles to its fleet, making half of its entire fleet 

environmentally friendly vehicles. 

Our global bus fleet is also at the forefront of 

Green technology.

In Singapore, 76% of SBS Transit’s fleet or 2,462 

buses was Euro 5-compliant in 2017, up from 2,288 

buses in 2016. The average age of its fleet was six 

years. SBS Transit, our listed subsidiary, operated 

a total of 208 bus routes in 2017, up from 202 in 

2016, while mileage of the buses was reduced to 

191 million km in 2017, from 241 million km in 20164.

In London, Metroline added 165 hybrid double 

deck vehicles in 2017, keeping in line with its 

philosophy to maintain a young, environmentally 

friendly fleet. Hybrid buses make up more than 20% 

of its fleet of 1,900 buses. After launching the 

world’s first all electric, zero emission double deck 

bus service in London last year, Metroline added 

another 23 single deck all electric models to serve 

Route 46. Aside from this, Metroline is targeting to 

operate its entire fleet on Euro 6 or better by 2020. 

We do not just buy Green vehicles, we also 

work hand in hand with our vehicle manufacturers 

and fuel suppliers in the field of Green Engineering, 

providing them with valuable feedback with 

4  Mileage in 2017 dropped although the total number of bus routes operated increased. This is because the number of bus routes in operation 

are taken as at 31 December while the mileage clocked is based on cummulative total for the year. In the course of 2016, we operated 59 more 

routes but they were not included in the number of bus services reported at the end of the year given that we were no longer running them 

then. Their mileage, however, was still recorded while they were in operation during the year.

ENVIRONMENT

Energy Efficiency

Being in the land transport business, energy  

efficiency ranks high on our priority list. This is 

especially important given the amount of time our 

vehicles spend on the road. Most of our taxis, for 

example, run practically non-stop as the bulk of them 

operate on dual shifts.

In all, our operations consumed about 1,470,195 GJ 

of fuel in 2017.

With advancements in vehicular technology, 

ComfortDelGro Taxi has been deploying taxis with 

smaller engine capacities, without compromising on 

performance. The two-litre Euro 4 Hyundai Sonata taxi 

has, for instance, been replaced by the 1.7-litre Euro 5 

Hyundai i-40 model.

Better fuel efficiency was also achieved through 

initiatives like EcoDrive in the UK and Scania Optimise in 

Australia, where drivers are trained on how to maximise 

fuel efficiency. In the Optimise system, the driving 

performance of drivers is tracked and weekly reports 

are provided to show them how they have performed in 

reducing emissions and fuel consumption. 

regard to the engineering performance of prototype 

vehicles and fuel technologies. 

In Australia, CDC in Melbourne conducted a 

hybrid bus trial in September 2017. The bus is able 

to yield fuel savings of 30% compared to a regular 

diesel Volvo B7 bus operating the same routes.

The bulk of our electricity consumption comes from 

our train operations. To reduce electricity consumption, 

energy-efficient lightings such as Light Emitting Diode 

(LED) lighting and fluorescent light fittings are used 

within our train stations while natural light is employed at 

station entrances. The escalators in the new stations are 

also installed with energy saving features. When there 

is no one using the escalator, speed is reduced. The air 

conditioning system has also been installed with carbon 

dioxide sensors to regulate the outdoor air supply to the 

stations. As a result, energy consumption is reduced.

Another energy saving feature adopted is the use of 

solar panels in Downtown Line’s (DTL) Gali Batu Depot. 

These panels are able to generate about 1,150 MWh 

of energy per year, which is used to offset the power 

consumption of the depot.

Our Green efforts are extended to the design of our 

trains too. The new generation trains on the DTL feature  

a range of environmentally friendly innovations. The use  

of the efficient regenerative brakes means that every  

time the train stops, it recovers the kinetic energy and 

converts it for use in other areas. This also means less 

wear and tear on the mechanical brakes. The excess 

energy can be utilised by an accelerating train nearby or 

channelled back to the power distribution network for 

other uses. This helps DTL to shave off close to 2% of  

its energy consumption a year which is enough to power 

370 Housing &amp; Development Board five-room flats a year.

It is estimated that drivers in the UK reduce 

average fuel consumption by as much as 15% a year 

and cut carbon dioxide emissions by more than 

half a tonne if they adopt the driving patterns as 

recommended by the trainers. These include proper 

acceleration and braking techniques, as well as other 

Green tips such as switching the engine off when 

stationary, filling up to three-quarter tank and de-

cluttering the vehicle to lighten the load.

Rigorous Maintenance

The saying goes that prevention is better than  

cure. This is certainly true for vehicles and  

machinery. Indeed, vehicles that are operating 

at less than optimal level tend to emit more 

harmful emissions. This is why we have a rigorous 

maintenance regime in place. 

ComfortDelGro taxis in Singapore are checked 

once a month, while the buses are checked once every 

45 to 60 days. Rental cars, on the other hand, undergo 

six-monthly preventive maintenance checks. As part of 

regulatory requirement, vehicles that are at least three 

years old are inspected at VICOM to ensure they meet 

safety standards for roadworthiness. 

In Vietnam, taxis are also serviced every 5,000km 

which is about once every month, while in China, 

companies like Jilin ComfortDelGro Taxi conducts 

inspection on its taxis to ensure they do not pose 

health and safety hazards while they are on the roads. 

Sustainability Report 2017  11


Preventive maintenance for single deck buses 

is carried out every 30,000km which is about 

once every four months. Double deck buses are 

put on an even tighter schedule because of their 

usage and weight. It docks at every 15,000km, or 

about once every eight to 10 weeks.

In between preventive maintenance checks, 

buses also have to go through safety checks on 

all safety-related components like the brakes, 

exhaust and steering.

Under the Land Transport Authority 

regulations, all buses must go for a half-yearly 

Roadworthiness Certification conducted by 

authorised inspection centres. This inspection 

involves checking the steering, oil leakage, 

suspension system, corrosion, brakes and smoke 

emission. The bodywork of buses is also checked 

for passenger safety and the buses put through 

a Chassis Dynamometer Smoke Test. SBS Transit 

achieved a 100% pass rate for 2017.

days are also organised where employees are 

encouraged to bring paper, plastic and cans from 

their homes for “deposit” into the bins. 

The Group’s paper consumption increased from 

36,895 reams in 2016 to 38,992 reams in 20178, 

whereas a total of 70,505kg of paper and cartons 

was collected for recycling in Singapore in 2017 –  

a decrease from 101,580kg in 20169.

The most significant use of water in the Group pertains 

to the washing of vehicles. About 98% of water 

consumed by the Group in 2017 is from municipal water 

supplies. About 1% is from rainwater and less than 1% 

from groundwater.

Waste Management

We have in place measures to manage waste. For 

example, ComfortDelGro Engineering has an automated 

Central Oil Management and Dispensing System, where 

technicians only need to disengage the hose and the 

system will do the rest. There is no mess, no spillage 

and no wastage. Better yet, the system eliminates the 

need for bottles and drums which were previously 

needed to store these fluids.

All waste from across our Business Units in 

Singapore is collected by companies licensed by 

the NEA. This ensures that all hazardous items are 

responsibly disposed. 

In 2017, our business generated 7,979 tonnes of waste 

materials (Table 3), which includes batteries, engine oil, 

tyres, metal, drums, papers and cartons. SBS Transit 

generated 814 tonnes, and VICOM generated 16 tonnes. 

Recycling bins are placed at strategic locations in 

our offices to encourage staff to recycle. Recycling 

 Water consumption in Singapore increased 

from 973,837 litres in 2016 to 1,038,365 litres in 2017.

Supporting Community Initiatives

On Eco Action Day which falls on 5 June 2017, staff 

at ComfortDelGro were encouraged to green their 

workstations by planting free saplings in their unused 

containers. Close to 1,000 saplings of Fittonia, 

Philodendron Gold and the money plant were 

snapped up on that day.

VICOM and SETSCO also supported “Eco Action 

Day Recycling Campaign” by promoting to reuse, 

reduce and recycle limited resources. About 4,500 

sets of used newspaper were donated to Willing 

Hearts for their food preparation.

In 2017, CDC in Victoria extended its sustainability 

profile through a bus-led sustainability project to 

green the Werribee River Parklands in the West of 

Melbourne. The event was jointly funded by CDC, 

Volgren (bus body builders) and CMV  

(Volvo bus dealer). 

Nanjing ComfortDelGro Daijian Taxi continued 

with its cultivation of 500 trees that were planted in 

2012, in order to reduce the environment footprint of 

each passenger’s journey.

Besides organising various Green events 

throughout the year, ComfortDelGro also actively 

encourages staff to use water and electricity 

responsibly. Tips on how to save water, electricity and 

other resources – not just in the office but at home 

too – are regularly communicated to staff, either 

through emails or through notice board posters.

Label recertification in 2018. VICOM and SETSCO 

were also recertified the Eco Office Label in 2016.

 

The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) 

awarded the DTL the BCA Green Mark GoldPLUS 

certification in October 2017, the highest tier  

achieved for a rail to-date, for its environmentally 

friendly features.

Having met both the technical competence 

requirements and management system requirements, 

VICOM successfully recertified itself in accordance to 

the International Standard ISO/IEC 17025:2005 in July 

2017 by the Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC). 

In June 2017, SETSCO was awarded the certificate 

of accreditation by the SAC to ISO/IEC 17021-1:2015 

Conformity assessment, a requirement for bodies 

providing audit and certification of management 

systems. 

With this accreditation, SETSCO is able to offer 

a wide range of certification services to companies 

which seek compliances to the requirements of:

• 

ISO 9001  : Quality Management System

• 

ISO 14001 : Environmental Management System

• 

 ISO 18001 : Occupational Safety &amp; Health

HEALTH &amp; SAFETY

HEALTH &amp; SAFETY

The health and safety of our customers, employees, 

relevant Stakeholders and the public is of critical 

importance to us as a Group. With more than 

42,500 vehicles plying the roads in seven countries, 

we have in place stringent checks, systems and 

processes to ensure that health and safety is never 

compromised. We have also invested heavily in 

training and re-training, and run awareness and 

training programmes to instil and reinforce a safety 

and security conscious culture in employees at all 

levels. This focus continues to be strongly reflected 

in the Group’s policies, procedures and training.

Year in Review

Road and passenger safety has, and will continue to 

be, a key area of focus for the Group.

Since 2016, our health and safety statistics cover 

our businesses in the United Kingdom (UK) and 

Australia, in addition to Singapore.

There had been no incidents of non-compliance 

with regulation and voluntary codes concerning the 

health and safety impacts of products and services 

during their life cycle.

Singapore4

For 2017, the Group’s vehicles in Singapore made 

trips totalling 2,091.94 million kilometres5. The bulk 

of this was made by our taxis (close to 90%). Public 

scheduled buses accounted for about 9% of total 

distance travelled.

2.89 passenger injuries per one million kilometres travelled 

in Singapore, or 0.02 injuries per one thousand journeys. 

There were unfortunately four passenger fatalities. In terms 

of vehicle collisions, we averaged 0.29 collisions for every 

one million kilometres with a total of 601 collisions6, out of 

which 138 were from SBS Transit.

To reduce such accidents, SBS Transit increased 

its efforts in safety training and re-training, including 

amending the Pedestrian Drills and Junction Drills to 

minimise occurrences. It had also, in 2017, installed 

more buses with Mobileye, a smart camera that is able 

to detect, analyse and monitor road conditions while 

the vehicle is moving and provide real-time audio-

visual warning via a display unit to the driver. For more

injuries7, resulting in 1,553 lost days8 in 2017, 

was also recorded. Of the 62 cases, a majority 

involved male employees. A very small proportion 

of incidents involved contract workers. Injuries 

sustained such as cuts were at the eyes, hands 

and legs. Analysing the data, we see that 

workplace non-fatal injuries were mainly due to: 

• Slips, Trips and Falls (53%);

• Work-related Traffic9 (16%); and

• Others (16%)

8  Lost days are defined as days that could not be worked as a result of a worker or workers who are unable to perform the usual work 

because of an occupational accident or disease.

9  A work-related traffic accident, as defined by the Singapore Ministry of Manpower, is any unintended event that causes bodily injury to a 

vocational driver or rider while he or she is driving any vehicle in the course of work.

Workplace Safety &amp; Health 

Committees

One of the ways in which the Group 

manages its health and safety issues is 

through its Workplace Safety &amp; Health 

(WSH) Committees. (Annex A)

Singapore

In Singapore, all our Business Units have dedicated 

WSH Committees. This decentralised approach is more 

practical in terms of engaging and intensifying staff 

engagement at the Business Unit level. It also instils 

in them a sense of ownership over health and safety 

issues that arise from day-to-day operations.

Senior Management is involved actively in 

the Committees. For example, VICOM’s WSH 

Committee, which comprises 12 members, including 

a representative from each of its seven inspection 

centres, is chaired by a Management representative.

Similarly, ComfortDelGro Engineering’s 10-member 

WSH Committee is led by Management, which 

meets once every month to review health and safety 

issues. Several staff were trained and appointed 

Safety Captains in 2017 to assist the WSH Officer in 

ensuring safety measures are complied with. To-date, 

87 Safety Captains have been appointed. In addition 

to its WSH Committee, ComfortDelGro Engineering 

has a Company Emergency Response Team (CERT), 

comprising seven staff since October 2016.

SBS Transit has a Safety Steering Committee 

chaired by its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) with 

Senior Management staff from its bus and rail 

businesses participating as members. The Committee 

is instrumental in promoting health and safety within 

the Company, looking at new policies and strategies 

to this end. SBS Transit’s rail business has two Senior 

Management Safety Committees for North East Line 

(NEL) and Downtown Line (DTL) in addition to the 

three separate WSH Committees for NEL, DTL and its 

Sengkang-Punggol Light Rail Transit (SPLRT) systems. 

The bus business also holds its WSH Committee 

meetings at the depots every month.

18  ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited


ComfortDelGro Driving Centre has an Accident 

Review Committee which was formed to evaluate and 

assess accidents, as well as develop learning points 

before providing counsel for preventive measures. 

The Committee has a high participation rate from its 

Management and staff. Findings from the review are 

shared during monthly dialogue sessions with staff and 

new instructors before they are deployed on the ground.

In the case of ComfortDelGro Rent-A-Car, it has a 

Risk Management and Risk Assessment team in place of 

a WSH Committee. 

United Kingdom

In the UK, Metroline’s WSH Committees are 

decentralised. These garage-based WSH Committees 

include both Management and staff representatives of 

each garage functions as well as contractors. They meet 

at least every quarter and are responsible for all local 

health and safety issues. 

Likewise, Scottish Citylink Coaches has a WSH 

Committee that meets every quarter and is chaired by 

its Operations Director. Its WSH Committee promotes 

safe systems of work as well as highlights any health 

and safety concerns to Senior Management. It is also 

responsible for ensuring that the Health and Safety 

notice board, which displays a copy of the latest WSH 

Committee minutes, is maintained.

CityFleet Networks in London has both a centralised 

Risk Management Committee and CERT, which meet 

every six months. These meetings are attended by 

Senior Management as well as up to five staff. 

Australia

Each of the depots in CDC has a Workplace Health &amp; 

Safety (WHS) Committee comprising Management and 

staff representatives from Drivers Groups, Mechanics/

Workshops, Administration and Planning &amp; Scheduling. 

These teams meet every quarter – sometimes even 

monthly – and are in charge of distributing WHS 

messages to their various workgroups and supporting 

the businesses work health safety agenda.

In both New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, 

a Management representative attends all meetings 

and draws together common themes for action 

by Senior Management. Where necessary, issues 

are escalated to the Board. In addition, the WHS 

Committee representatives attend recurring forums to 

discuss company-wide issues. Depots with a “SPaRCQ 

Committee” are also organised regularly to discuss 

safety and other related issues. 

In February 2017, a General Manager-Safety &amp; Risk 

was jointly appointed by CDC to review and streamline 

all safety, risk and workers’ compensation across the 

broader business. He is in charge of creating and 

implementing Business Continuity Plans for both 

operations in NSW and Victoria. 

Swan Taxis’ existing Occupational Safety and Health 

(OSH) policy is managed by its OSH officer, who reports 

directly to the CEO. The officer is responsible for 

carrying out OSH activities, including promoting health 

and safety messages at the workplace. The Company 

formed an OSH Committee in 2017. In addition to this, 

Swan Taxis has both a three-member Incident Response 

Group and an eight-member Crisis Management Group, 

headed by the CEO, who meets them when required.

China

In West China, Business Units such as Chengdu 

ComfortDelGro Taxi and ComfortDelGro Rent-A-Car 

(Chengdu) have WSH Committees comprising between 

three and five members. These WSH Committees 

chair monthly safety meetings that are attended by 

Management staff as well as drivers. 

As for Business Units that do not have such 

Committees, Management takes the lead in conducting 

health and safety briefings as well as organising regular 

emergency exercises to ensure its staff are responsive 

at all times. For example, Chengdu ComfortDelGro 

Qing Yang Driving School conducts health and safety 

meetings that are attended by department managers 

and supervisors so as to raise their awareness towards 

safety issues and to work together to minimise 

risks. Health and safety messages are also regularly 

disseminated to staff, especially driving instructors and 

safety officers.

In Guangzhou, in place of a WSH Committee is a 

nine-member Safety Production Committee, which 

meets once a quarter. It manages matters related 

to occupational diseases, hazards and emergency 

responses. Management staff is equally involved in 

these meetings. 

Our taxi companies in Shenyang, China, also have 

qualified safety supervisors who head the Safety 

Departments. The Operations Manager fronts the CERT.

Vietnam

In Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam Taxi has fire fighting teams 

as regulatory requirements. It also formed a Labour 

Safety Committee in 2017, comprising four members led 

by a Management representative. The Committee meets 

once every six months. 

Emergency Preparedness

To respond appropriately to 

potential emergency situations, all 

our Business Units regularly assess 

health and safety risks related to 

their operations and take adequate 

precautionary measures.

For example, ComfortDelGro Driving Centre, which 

builds its entire business model on safe and responsible 

driving, conducts mandatory safety briefings for all 

learners. It also continued to send its driving instructors 

for first aid training, which is certified once every two 

years. Over 40 driving instructors underwent first 

aid training to equip them with the necessary skills 

should accidents happen while practical training is 

being conducted. 

Sustainability Report 2017  19


HEALTH &amp; SAFETY

During the year, SETSCO also trained its first aid 

assistants to ensure they are equally ready should 

designated first-aiders be unavailable. Various 

company-wide emergency drills simulating gas leaks 

and fires were also conducted to improve the awareness 

and emergency response of all staff. 

In view of the flammable materials that are stored at 

Bukit Batok, one of its branches, VICOM formed a CERT 

there and staff are given Personal Protective Equipment 

(PPE). During the year, table top exercises and fire drills 

were conducted to familiarise CERT members.

To ensure staff are familiar with emergency 

procedures, SBS Transit conducted four bus disruption 

exercises involving bus depots and interchanges, and 

three rail service disruption exercises involving the Bus 

Group and Passenger Service teams in 2017. It also 

conducted three security exercises at the depots  

to test the response plans during the discovery of 

suspicious items. 

In China, Guangzhou Xin Tian Wei Transportation 

Development’s Tianhe Bus Station carried out fire drills 

to test its staff’s knowledge of the evacuation process. 

CDC in Sydney and Melbourne held “toolbox” 

talks that focussed on safe work practices in light of 

suspicious packages left on buses. 

All public buses in Singapore, Australia and the UK 

are equipped with call out buttons that allow our bus 

drivers to speak to the Operations Control Centre when 

there are emergencies. Similarly, our taxis in Singapore, 

Western Australia, China and the UK come with distress 

buttons that taxi drivers can activate whenever they 

require emergency help. These distress buttons when 

activated allow our call centre agents to listen in and to 

activate emergency assistance, if needed. 

Training, Protective Equipment 

&amp; Preventive Measures

ComfortDelGro constantly puts 

a high emphasis on training to 

safeguard and improve safety 

standards, both at the workplace 

and for our passengers. We also 

ensure that all staff are adequately protected with the 

proper protective gear depending on their vocation. 

At SBS Transit, all new Bus Captains (BCs) undergoing 

basic training are schooled in safe and defensive driving. 

Training is intensive and spans between 31 and 46 days, 

including five days at the Singapore Bus Academy where 

they obtain the Omnibus Driver’s Vocational Licence. 

Besides theory lessons, new BCs undergo practical 

training and have to successfully pass the Class 4A driving 

test stringently administered by the Traffic Police before 

they are qualified to drive a bus. Upon completion of their 

training, BCs are then paired with Service Mentors, who 

would accompany them on their trips and share with them 

practical safety. 

Experienced BCs are also sent for regular refresher 

training courses aimed at enhancing their safe driving 

skills. BCs are also regularly briefed and reminded to 

observe safe driving habits through case studies which 

involve actual accidents. Pedestrian Drills, Junction 

Drills and Bus Stop Drills are continually drummed 

into them to inculcate the importance of road safety. 

Random spot checks are conducted to ensure BCs 

religiously comply with these safety drills. 

Metroline trialled two of its hybrid buses that 

operated in London’s Oxford Street with light and 

audible awareness equipment to dissuade vulnerable 

road users and pedestrians from stepping into the path 

of the buses. The trial, which received the full support 

of the Royal National Institute for the Blind, saw a 

reduction in pedestrian injury incidents near the buses, 

and garnered positive feedback from all Stakeholders, 

including bus drivers, who found their journeys 

becoming less stressful as a result. More hybrid buses 

will be equipped with the same equipment as part of 

academic research. 

 On 1 October 2017, Metroline implemented a 

Voluntary Safe Driving Reward Scheme at Potters 

Bar Bus Garage to incentivise bus drivers who reduce 

blameworthy damage of accidents that occur on public 

roads and in the garage.

In NSW, CDC communicates customer service and 

safety messages to its bus drivers at its depots using 

diamond-shaped signs. These were first developed and 

launched by Hillsbus in 2013, but can now be seen at 

depots of Hunter Valley Buses, Blue Mountains Transit 

and Qcity Transit in Queanbeyan. Bus marshals are also 

put through rear door loading safety training to ensure 

they are able to assist passengers safely. 

In Victoria, CDC installed security screens on its 

buses to protect bus drivers from unruly passengers. 

It also introduced on-board voice announcements to 

eliminate the need for bus drivers to ask passengers for 

fares, and thereby the risks of them being verbally and 

physically assaulted by passengers. 

In our global taxi operations, stringent screening 

of new taxi drivers, including going through their past 

safety records, is conducted before any agreement is 

inked. New taxi drivers have to go through an induction 

briefing, comprising basic service training and a module 

on defensive driving. 

To incentivise taxi drivers to maintain an accident-free 

record, ComfortDelGro Taxi rewards its taxi drivers with 

No Claim Bonuses. Taxi drivers who maintain accident-

free records for four consecutive years would not have 

to pay their share of repairs should they unfortunately 

meet with one thereafter. Drivers who are deemed to be 

accident-prone are sent for defensive driving courses at 

ComfortDelGro Driving Centre. Upon completion of the 

defensive driving course, taxi drivers’ accident records 

are monitored for the next six months. Those involved in 

yet another accident within the six-month period would 

have their service contracts revoked. 

In China, safety meetings are an integral part of 

monthly meetings and dialogue sessions that our taxi 

companies in Shenyang and Chengdu have with their 

taxi drivers. Training is provided to taxi drivers prior to 

them being on the roads. Taxi drivers with accident-free 

records are rewarded with both quarterly and annual 

incentives, while accident-prone taxi drivers are given 

remedial training before they are back on the roads.

20  ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited


Our driving schools are also strong advocates where 

safety is concerned. 

ComfortDelGro Driving Centre has in place a Circuit 

Observation Programme. The Chief Instructors monitor 

circuit training sessions and look out for lapses in the 

coaching methodology, safety and quality. Actions are 

taken thereafter to correct any lapses. The Centre also 

works closely with the Traffic Police to alter test routes 

that are deemed too dangerous for learners. 

In Chengdu, Chengdu ComfortDelGro Qing Yang 

Driving School conducts health and safety meetings that 

are attended by Managers and Supervisors to raise their 

awareness towards safety issues and to work together to 

minimise risks. Health and safety messages are regularly 

disseminated to staff, especially driving instructors and 

safety officers. Its car rental unit, ComfortDelGro Rent-

A-Car (Chengdu), conducts bi-monthly safety discussion 

and holds safety meetings twice a month in Chengdu 

and Nanba.

SBS Transit’s bus and rail engineering staff are 

trained and qualified to perform their various jobs 

in accordance with the Work at Height regulations, 

which came into effect in May 2014. Similarly, SETSCO 

staff, who have to work at heights above three metres, 

are also put through safety courses conducted 

by accredited training providers as well as safety 

orientation and site familiarisation courses organised 

by clients in the construction, shipyard, marine and oil/

petrochemical sectors. 

Other courses such as risk management and first 

aid are also conducted for staff both in-house and 

through accredited training providers. In 2017, to 

drive safety awareness across all staff and beef up 

emergency response skills of the first responders 

within the Company, SETSCO launched the “Safety Is 

MY Responsibility” campaign, which included training 

its CERT on emergency stretcher management and 

new emergency rescue techniques. The CERT as well 

as fire wardens also received training on walkie-talkie 

call-sign etiquette for better communication during an 

emergency situation. 

SETSCO employees, who are exposed to prolonged 

noise at volumes above 85 decibels, may be at risk 

of noise-induced deafness, while those in charge of 

radiographic testing could risk radiation over-exposure. 

To tackle the former, ear plugs or mufflers are issued 

to employees and breaks in between jobs are planned 

for. These employees are also sent for annual medical 

check-ups, which include hearing tests. In the case 

of radiographic testing, licensed staff are required to 

wear a thermo luminescent dosimeter badge, which 

is submitted to the National Environment Agency 

every month, to ensure they are not overly exposed to 

radiation. Similarly, these employees are sent for annual 

medical check-ups to ensure they are given a clean bill 

of health.

VICOM vehicle inspectors, who have to perform 

visual inspection and operate test equipment as part of 

their daily routine, undergo the Technical Knowledge 

Evaluation examination to ensure that they are kept 

abreast of the latest advancements in vehicle technology 

as well as inspection rules and regulations. A Safety 

Demerit Points System is in place to ensure that they 

comply with safety rules. They are also provided with 

PPE such as boots, ear-plugs, eye-wears and gloves. 

Recognising that both vehicle inspectors and 

motorists could face the risk of slips, trips and falls, 

as well as accidents at its inspection centres, VICOM 

installed safety enhancement features, including 

railings, flexible bollards, convex mirrors, reflective 

tapes for better visibility, as well as anti-slip plates 

and surfaces to prevent slips. This is in addition to 

the barriers and warning signs that are already in 

place. Walkways for motorists are also painted to 

clearly demarcate them from inspection areas. 

ComfortDelGro Engineering displays banners at 

all its workshops as well as diesel and petrol kiosks to 

remind taxi drivers to comply with safety at all times. 

Preventive Maintenance 

Checks &amp; Vehicle Inspection

Our vehicle fleets in Singapore 

undergo regular preventive 

maintenance checks. 

ComfortDelGro taxis are 

checked once a month, while 

buses are checked once every 45 to 60 days. Rental 

cars undergo six-monthly preventive maintenance 

checks as part of road safety measures. As part 

of regulatory requirement, vehicles that are at 

least three years old are inspected at our vehicle 

inspection and testing Business Unit, VICOM, 

to ensure they meet safety standards for road-

worthiness, while taxis are inspected half-yearly.

In the UK, our London buses go through 

inspections as well, while our inter- and intra-

City coaches are inspected every 28 days by 

subcontractors in line with the requirements laid by 

the Department of Transport. Taxi drivers under our 

radio circuit networks conduct daily basic checks of 

their taxis and have them serviced every 6,000 to 

8,000 miles to ensure their roadworthiness. 

Taxis in the UK have to pass a rigorous check 

every year to qualify for a licence plate, which is 

displayed on the back and inside of the taxi. Six 

months later, these taxis undergo a test by the 

Ministry of Transport, which will last to the end of 

the year where the licence-plate qualifying process 

starts over again. This test will determine the 

licensed taxi is roadworthy and maintained at  

a high standard. Enforcement units conduct  

random spot checks on the road or visit taxi  

drivers at home to inspect the taxis. Taxis that do 

not meet regulatory requirements are issued “stop 

notes”. This means the taxi driver cannot work until 

the stop note is lifted.

Our Australian buses are maintained once 

a month in accordance with manufacturers’ 

recommendations. Buses in NSW are inspected 

twice a year, while buses in Victoria are inspected 

once a year. As for taxis, the State Government’s 

Department of Transport requires all taxis to 

Sustainability Report 2017  21


Community Engagement

While the importance of safe 

driving cannot be emphasised 

enough, passengers and other 

road users also have a role to play 

in ensuring that roads remain safe. 

In Singapore, the Group, 

through ComfortDelGro Driving Centre, SBS Transit 

and VICOM, engaged the community through 

several road safety talks during the year.

To create safety awareness amongst road users, 

ComfortDelGro Driving Centre collaborated with the 

Traffic Police to conduct 560 hours worth of road 

safety education at the Road Safety Park. It also 

conducted road safety talks to over 11,420 Primary 

and Secondary school students at the schools. 

Similarly, SBS Transit, conducted 88 school assembly 

talks and visits to our bus and train premises and 

reached out to some 32,164 students. 

With the opening of DTL3, SBS Transit conducted 

14 community engagement sessions where some 

1,700 individuals, including Members of Parliament, 

grassroots leaders, residents and students living 

along the DTL3 corridor, as well as social influencers, 

had the chance to visit the stations and participate in 

train evacuation exercises. The sessions also included 

briefings on safety features when entering the fare 

Our scheduled buses also come with speed limit 

devices that prevent them from accelerating beyond 

60kmh. Similarly, the Mobile Data Terminal (MDT) in our 

taxis come with speed alerts that automatically prompt 

our taxi drivers to slow down when they have exceeded 

the speed limit. 

To better manage and control visitors’ entry into 

its premises, SBS Transit, which rolled out an online 

electronic visitor management system at its bus depots 

in April 2016, also rolled out the same system at both 

NEL and DTL depots in 2017. Work is in progress to roll 

out the same system at its NEL and DTL stations by 

March 2018.

As for surveillance on board our vehicles, nearly all 

our public transport service vehicles in Singapore have 

CCTVs or in-vehicle cameras15. In the UK, all Metroline 

buses are equipped with CCTVs. Down Under, all Swan 

taxis have in-vehicle cameras, while all public transport 

service of CDC are equipped with this capability.

undergo an annual inspection as part of the licensing 

agreement.

In Vietnam, taxis are also serviced at every 5,000 

kilometres, which is around once every month, while 

in China, taxi companies like Jilin ComfortDelGro Taxi 

conducts inspection on its taxis to ensure they do not 

pose safety hazards while they are on the roads. 

Technology

At ComfortDelGro, we are always 

finding new ways to leverage on 

technology to improve the way we 

do things. Safety is no exception.

SBS Transit, a forerunner in 

this area, puts its BCs through a 

mandatory “Driving Skills Enhancement Programme” 

to obtain an objective assessment of their driving 

competency with areas identified for improvement. This 

is done using technology based on the Vigil Vanguard 

system, which comprises motion sensors, cameras and 

mapping software. The BCs’ driving behaviour is closely 

reviewed through Vigil’s video recording used to help them 

improve on their areas of weaknesses. Accident-prone 

taxi drivers are also sent for defensive driving courses 

conducted by ComfortDelGro Driving Centre, which uses 

the same Vigil Vanguard system. 

SBS Transit continued to install its buses with Mobileye, 

a smart camera that is able to detect, analyse and monitor 

road conditions while the vehicle is moving and provide 

real-time audio-visual warning via a display unit to the 

driver. In 2017, 812 buses were installed with Mobileye. More 

than 1,000 buses will be installed with the same device in 

2018. CDC also followed in the footsteps of SBS Transit 

by installing Mobileye in more than 1,000 of their buses in 

NSW and Victoria. 

SBS Transit also tapped on the Hazard Awareness 

Training and Test system (HATT), an interactive video-

based system that trains BCs to identify both potential 

and developing hazards. These videos are based on actual 

roads that BCs would be familiar with. Besides equipping 

them with the skill set to identify hazards, they are also 

taught how to prevent accidents by taking appropriate 

defensive measures. With the ability to identify and take 

corrective actions, BCs are better equipped to provide a 

safer journey for their commuters. Metroline did something 

similar. It filmed the bus routes that its probationary bus 

drivers practise on, and added animation to the footage 

to help them identify risk areas. ComfortDelGro Taxi had, 

in 2017, adopted the HATT system for its new taxi drivers 

who were involved in accidents.

GoRoute is the other video-based system that enables 

SBS Transit BCs to learn their service routes and safety 

drills in a classroom setting. The videos are based on actual 

road conditions of their respective service routes, including 

indications of special zones such as the school zone and 

black spot areas. With better knowledge of their service 

routes, our BCs can focus more on driving safely.

gates and trains as well as travelling on escalators. 

VICOM holds regular talks for both local and 

international delegates, imparting knowledge on the 

best practices used in keeping Singapore’s roads 

greener and safer. In 2017, such talks were held with 

delegates from various countries including Azerbaijan, 

Bangladesh, Brunei, Djibouti and Vietnam. 

For SBS Transit, commuter safety is further 

enhanced through the use of priority seats reserved for 

elderly passengers, physically-disabled, or mothers-

to-be. Passengers are also reminded to observe safe 

travelling habits through prominently displayed safety 

posters and messages on board buses, trains and 

stations. These include holding onto handrails and 

stanchion poles, and not running around on board 

buses and trains. 

CDC buses in Sydney and Melbourne have similar 

priority seats reserved for those who are mobility-

challenged. To reduce slips, trips and falls on board 

their buses in Sydney and Melbourne, CDC carried out 

a “Please Hold On” campaign to educate passengers on 

the need to hold on to the handrails or hand grabs.

Recognition

A number of our Business 

Units in Singapore has 

obtained the Occupational 

Health and Safety Assessment 

Series (OHSAS) 18001:2007 

and bizSAFE certifications. These include 

ComfortDelGro Bus, ComfortDelGro Engineering, 

Moove Media, SBS Transit’s NEL, VICOM as well  

as SETSCO. 

Four ComfortDelGro taxi drivers and two SBS 

Transit BCs were awarded in the “Safe Driver” and 

“Most Improved Driver” categories for their good 

driving record and safe driving behaviour at the 

Singapore Road Safety Awards 2017 in October. 

ComfortDelGro Bus also received the Road 

Safety Award for Companies with Bus Fleet by the 

Singapore Road Safety Council.

In the UK, Metroline bus driver, Mr Stan Davern, 

from Holloway Garage was also crowned the 

Company’s Transport Safety Champion for 

keeping his record accident-free for 38 years.

decision matrix approach is used with assigned 

weightage that reflects the relative importance of  

each selection criterion.

Suppliers are also given a “Supplier Ethics Policy” 

(refer to pages 26 to 27) which clearly articulates 

what is required of them in terms of fair practice, 

ethical conduct, as well as social and environmental 

responsibility. We will avoid dealing with Suppliers who 

are unable to comply with our policy.

All recommendations for award are approved in 

accordance to the financial authority limits delegated 

by the ComfortDelGro Board.

Risks Identification and Mitigation

Fraud and Corruption Risk

All officers administering and approving contracts 

in which they or their close relatives have significant 

interests are required to declare and disqualify 

themselves from handling these contracts. Staff in the 

procurement and purchasing team make a declaration 

on conflict of interest annually. All members of the 

Procurement Category team are to undergo training on 

“Procurement Fraud Prevention &amp; Detection” within their 

first two years of service. The workshop equips our staff 

on effective internal controls within the procurement 

process, as well as the prevention and detection of 

procurement fraud.

SUPPLY CHAIN

Our Suppliers

Our suppliers are our partners. Without the goods and 

services they provide, we would not be able to run our 

businesses. Working closely with them, we explore 

ways to increase efficiency and productivity through 

the procurement of supplies and services which help 

improve our processes and grow our business. We are 

committed to treating our suppliers with respect. We 

pay our bills on time, every time and are transparent in 

all our contracts and negotiations.

SUPPLY CHAIN

24  ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited


Overview of  

the Scoring System

Supply Risk

For key purchase categories, the award strategy 

often includes multiple suppliers from different 

geographical locations. Where multiple suppliers 

are not feasible due to various reasons, the Business 

Continuity Plan of the sole supplier is scrutinised  

and assessed.

Legal Risk

More than 95% of our contracts with suppliers apply 

one of our four Standard Terms &amp; Conditions. These 

contracts contain insurance and limitations of liability 

clauses. Where Suppliers’ contracts are used, we 

engage our lawyers to vet through the terms to 

ensure that they are fair and reasonable.

Price Risk

Where product prices are driven by the volatile 

commodity prices, an indexed formula is used. This 

allows our Treasury Department to mitigate cost 

fluctuation through hedging.

Environmental, Health and Safety Risk

Depending on the nature of purchases, safety 

rules detailing Environmental, Health and Safety 

requirements are included in tender documents. 

Suppliers are required to undertake to comply 

with the rules. For complex projects, suppliers are 

required to complete a risk assessment before 

commencing work.

Supplier Performance Management

We ensure that our suppliers’ performance meets 

the expectations defined in the contract and against 

market norms through our Supplier Performance 

Management exercise. Our key suppliers undergo 

regular appraisals to ensure costs are kept in 

check, service standards are kept high and risks are 

mitigated. The ultimate intent is to identify potential 

issues and their root causes so that they can be 

resolved as quickly as possible.

In 2017, 22 strategic suppliers* across eight 

key categories were assessed on five pillars: 

Procurement, Quality, Logistics, Technology and 

Supply Security.

ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries 

worldwide (hereinafter collectively referred to as 

“ComfortDelGro”) procures a wide range of goods 

or services from various businesses, companies, 

corporations, persons and entities, including their 

employees, agents and representatives (hereinafter 

collectively referred to as “Suppliers”), in the course  

of its business operations. 

As such, ComfortDelGro requires its Suppliers 

to operate in accordance with the principles in this 

Supplier Ethics Policy (“Policy”) and in full compliance 

with all applicable laws and regulations. 

Suppliers are required to adhere to all local  

laws (including antitrust, anti-competition, anti-

corruption and anti-fraud policies), maintain high  

ethical standards, have clear health and safety policies,  

strict environmental policies, and adopt fair 

employment practices. 

It is the responsibility of Suppliers to ensure their 

employees and representatives understand, comply  

and act consistently with this Policy. Failure to adhere 

to this Policy may result in disqualification from 

consideration for business, and/or future business,  

with ComfortDelGro.

1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations 

 

1.1 Abidance with the Law 

 

 

 Suppliers’ business operations, as well as all 

goods and services supplied to ComfortDelGro, 

must fully comply with the laws and regulations 

of the countries where Suppliers’ operations are 

based as well as where goods and services are 

provided to ComfortDelGro. 

 

1.2 Use of Fair Business Practices 

 

 Suppliers must practise fair competition in 

accordance with local antitrust and competition 

laws. Activities that restrict competition must be 

avoided. Commercial decisions, including prices, 

terms of sale, division of markets and allocation 

of customers, must be made independent of 

understandings or agreements with competitors. 

2. Ethics and Conﬂict of Interest 

 

2.1 Anti-Corruption Stance 

 

 

 Suppliers must conduct their business 

with integrity, transparency and honesty. 

ComfortDelGro does not condone any 

corrupt practices such as bribery, extortion 

ComfortDelGro Group Procurement Policies &amp; Procedure Manual

or embezzlement in all business interactions. 

Suppliers are prohibited from offering, paying, 

soliciting or receiving (whether directly or 

otherwise) any form of bribe as inducement 

or reward for any business transaction with 

or involving ComfortDelGro. The term “bribe” 

broadly includes any illicit advantage such as 

(but is not limited to) cash, cash equivalents, 

property, loans, commissions, services, benefits 

in kind or other advantages.

 

2.2 Anti-Fraud Stance 

 

 

 In the same vein, ComfortDelGro does not 

condone any fraudulent practices such as 

intentional deception, misappropriation of 

resources or manipulation of data. Suppliers  

are prohibited from altering or falsifying  

records, failing to account for monies received 

or knowingly providing false information  

for any business transaction with or  

involving ComfortDelGro. 

 

2.3 Gifts and Entertainment 

 

 

 ComfortDelGro is committed to conducting all 

business without undue influence. The Policy 

requires it to exercise good judgment and 

practise moderation in receiving business gifts 

and entertainment. 

 

 

Suppliers must not offer or give gifts or  

 

 

 hospitality (including kickbacks, favours, 

cash, gratuity, entertainment or anything of 

value) to any ComfortDelGro employee that is 

intended as, or may be viewed as an attempt 

to improperly influence business decisions. 

In addition, ComfortDelGro employees are 

prohibited from accepting initial public offering 

(IPO) stock from any Supplier. 

 

 

Employees will respectfully decline  

 

 

 entertainment, gifts or other benefits that  

could in any way be construed as, or give  

the appearance of, attempting to influence 

business decisions in favour of any person or 

organisation with whom ComfortDelGro may 

have business dealings.

 

2.4 Conﬂicts of Interest 

 

 

 Suppliers should seek to avoid any conflicts 

of interest that may adversely influence their 

business relationship with ComfortDelGro.

OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND PARTNERS

ComfortDelGro is guided by the principle of  

creating sustainable value for its Stakeholders –  

be they Customers, Shareholders, Employees,  

Partners or Regulators. [GRI 102-40]

Key Stakeholders are identified as part of  

the Risk Management process, based on the extent  

in which they can affect or are affected by the 

operations of the Group. [GRI 102-42]

Given the significant roles they play, ComfortDelGro 

reaches out actively to key Stakeholders through 

various channels. 

Shareholders

We are committed to disseminating accurate and 

pertinent information to the marketplace in a timely 

manner as part of good Corporate Governance.

Our Investor Relations (IR) programme balances 

regular, effective and fair communications with 

Shareholders and the investment community with 

commercial sensitivities. The IR team works closely 

with Senior Management to proactively carry out this 

engagement programme and addresses questions 

on strategic, financial, operational, as well as 

environmental, social and governance issues. 

During the year, the IR team met more than 330 

groups of investors, analysts and equity sales personnel 

over 180 meetings. The team also addressed queries 

from investors through emails, telephone calls and the 

online enquiry form.

Besides face-to-face office meetings and conference 

calls, we also participated in six investor conferences 

and non-deal road shows in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur 

and Hong Kong. These platforms provide direct access 

to a wide cross-section of existing and new investors 

from around the world.

We organised face-to-face briefings for the 

media and sell-side analysts for the full-year results 

and conducted dial-in conference calls with sell-side 

analysts for the other quarterly results. Two post-

results luncheons were organised where we met fund 

managers based in Singapore after the full-year FY2016 

results and the first half results for FY2017.

ComfortDelGro attracts active research coverage 

from sell-side analysts and the stock is now covered by 

16 local and international research houses. More than 

180 reports on the Company and the industry were 

published during the year. The IR team has regular 

interactions with the analysts to ensure a thorough 

understanding of our business models and strategies, 

operations and financial performance, as well as 

growth opportunities.

Shareholders have the opportunity to interact 

with the Board and Senior Management at our Annual 

Customers

Good customer service is a fundamental aspect of  

our business. In fostering a customer-centric culture,  

a “customer first” mindset permeates through the 

Group and a robust customer engagement process  

is adopted. 

To this end, employees are equipped with the 

necessary skills and knowledge to provide customers 

with a best-in-class experience. Courses that are 

conducted include technical training courses like 

“Scania Optimise Programme” and “Automated 

Equipment Safety Training” as well as service-centric 

training like “Ice training for Frontline Workers” and 

“Service Standard and Etiquette Training”.

Frontline staff in all our businesses actively engage 

customers through various means including outreach 

programmes where potential and existing customers are 

invited to visit our operations once every few months. 

We also reach out to our customers through information 

counters, hotlines, as well as monthly Meet-the-

Managers rail sessions, and quarterly Commuter Chat 

sessions for bus commuters. These chat sessions allow 

SBS Transit to meet and engage commuters right where 

they are and hear directly from them about our services. 

Customers are encouraged to send us  

their feedback through customer questionnaires, 

online feedback forms or via our fully-manned service 

hotlines. Other than product and service enquiries, the 

key areas of concern amongst customers are safety, 

accessibility and the overall service experience.

Partners and Suppliers 

We work closely with our partners and suppliers 

to ensure the smooth delivery of our services. We 

recognise our dependency on the timely delivery 

of key parts and components and the quality of 

our subcontractors. This is a key risk which we have 

identified and which we manage diligently. We also  

have in place detailed Risk Management contingency 

plans where needed. More information can be found  

on pages 41 to 44.

As a responsible corporate citizen, we also strongly 

believe in ensuring compliance in all our operations 

and businesses. We do not condone any corrupt 

practices or anti-competitive behaviour. We have a 

strict procurement policy which, among other things, 

conducts supplier assessment to ensure there is no 

adverse impact on society. Among other things, 

suppliers are required to have strict environmental 

policies, adopt fair employment practices, have clear 

health and safety policies, and adhere to strict anti-

corruption policies.

More information can be found on pages 24 to 27.

Employees

With a global workforce of close to 22,000, employee 

engagement is a critical aspect of our human resource 

management. Talent management and succession 

planning rank high on ComfortDelGro’s priority list. 

Through regular employee engagement 

programmes including seminars, training courses, 

quarterly newsletters and weekly dialogue sessions,  

we are able to encourage critical thinking and 

innovation, build team spirit and groom the next 

generation of leaders. 

Managers are empowered and encouraged to hold 

regular feedback sessions with their subordinates. 

The annual appraisal performance session serves 

as a platform for employees to discuss their work 

performance and map out their career progression. 

Common issues raised by employees include training 

and remuneration. 

More information can be found on pages 30 to 37. 

Regulators

ComfortDelGro is firmly committed to complying  

with all legal and regulatory requirements.

As the provision of public land transport services 

is highly regulated, the Group, through our various 

Business Units, holds regular weekly dialogue 

sessions with the various Regulators including the 

Land Transport Authority, the SGX, the National 

Environment Agency and the Ministry of Manpower.

A range of topics are discussed at such meetings, 

including unfolding trends, new technologies, safety, 

competition, environmental and accessibility issues. 

Where Regulators seek consultation in reviewing 

existing and emerging policies, we are responsive  

and strive to provide constructive feedback. [GRI 102-43,  

GRI 102-44]

Our people are undoubtedly our most valued asset.

our staff, invest in comprehensive training 

to develop them to their maximum potential 

and engage them actively in what we do.

Diversity and Equal Opportunities

In 2017, the ComfortDelGro Group employed 21,918 

employees, representing a decrease of 0.6% over the 

previous year. 

At the Board level, two out of the nine Board 

Directors or 22% are women. In 2016, we had one 

female director. 

In our businesses, which are traditionally  

male-dominated, 86% of our employees are male. 

However, the number of female employees has been 

on the rise. For the year, the number of female staff 

increased by 46 or 1.5% compared to the year before. 

This is partly thanks to recruitment initiatives to 

encourage female employees and the shift in cultural 

norms and gender paradigms. 

With land transport being an essential means  

for the majority of people to get around, our business is 

generally not affected by seasonal demand. Hence, in 

2017, 94% of our staff held full-time positions while slightly 

more than 91% were employed on permanent contracts. 

Operating in seven countries, our workforce varied 

in size according to our business needs. In Singapore, 

which is our Headquarters, we had a staff strength of 

12,623. This compared to 5,762 in the United Kingdom 

(UK), 2,376 in Australia, 958 in China, 141 in Vietnam,  

41 in Malaysia and just 17 in Ireland. 

As a global group, we have a broad mix of 

nationalities among our staff, with Singaporeans 

accounting for the majority at 30%. The other 

nationalities include Malaysians (21%), British (17%), 

Australians (11%), and Chinese (8%). We also have a 

small representation of other nationalities accounting 

for about 13% in all. This includes the Irish, Vietnamese, 

Polish, Romanians, Indians and Pakistanis.

In spite of our diverse nationalities, we have an 

all-inclusive work culture, where people of different 

age groups, ethnicities and genders work together in 

harmony. At ComfortDelGro, we believe that diversity in 

the workplace is fundamental to growth and professional 

development. It benefits not just the individual, but the 

corporation as well, exposing the individual to different 

ideas, skills, views and attitudes. A diversified workforce 

- whether in terms of gender, race or nationality – also 

means we access the widest talent pools. 

With diversity, we have a policy of non-

discrimination, offering equal opportunities for our 

employees to grow. In this regard, we are guided by 

strict human rights and labour practices. In all that 

we do, we abide by the basic tenet of respecting, 

protecting and fulfilling human rights and fundamental 

freedoms. We ensure that employees are selected 

based on merit and competency.

We implement our guiding principles in a non-

discriminatory manner, paying particular attention 

to the rights and needs of, as well as the challenges 

faced by individuals, individuals within our Group who 

may be at heightened risk of becoming vulnerable 

or marginalised. We believe that regardless of age, 

sex, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, race, 

colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion, 

or affiliation to any political party or trade union, all 

our staff should be treated equitably and given fair 

opportunities to grow and develop in accordance to 

their levels of competence. 

We believe that with a fair, supportive and  

inclusive workplace, our people will be able to  

perform to their full potential. In Singapore, we  

have pledged our commitment to adhere to fair 

employment practices and are a member of the 

Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment 

Practices (TAFEP), a national agency that is helmed by 

the Singapore National Employers Federation and the 

National Trades Union Congress. We adhere to the five 

key principles of fair employment practices - recruiting 

and selecting employees on the basis of merit, treating 

them fairly and with respect, providing them with 

equal opportunities for training and development, 

rewarding them based on their ability, performance, 

and contribution and abiding by labour laws and the 

Tripartite Guidelines.

In employee recruitment, our advertisements do 

not state age, race, gender or religion as preferences or 

requirements. At interviews, applicants are not required 

to state their race, religion and marital status as they are 

assessed on competency and suitability.

As an equal opportunity employer, we also do not 

discriminate against any employee on the basis of age. 

Our people are as young as under 30 and with some as 

matured as over 70, working together and learning from 

each other. While we value the young for the spark and 

ingenuity they bring to the workplace, older workers 

are, and continue to be, a valued part of our workforce. 

They tend to be mature, reliable and bring a wealth of 

experience with them. 

In 2017, one in every two of our employees was 

between 30 and 50 years old. Those over 50 years old 

made up 36% of our global workforce while the under 

30s close to 13%. This age profile is not significantly 

different from that of 2016. 

At the workplace, we strongly subscribe to zero 

tolerance for discrimination. Employees who feel 

discriminated against can lodge a report to the 

Management, Union or the Authorities in charge of 

employment matters in the different countries that 

we operate in. For instance, SBS Transit, which has 

more than 10,000 employees, has an established 

grievance procedure, which is outlined in its employees’ 

agreement handbook that staff can refer to in lodging 

a complaint.

In 2017, there were three reports of discrimination 

filed - two against the UK’s Metroline and one against 

ComfortDelGro Corporation Australia (CDC) in New 

South Wales (NSW), Australia. For Metroline, a staff 

alleged that he was discriminated against because of his 

disability while another reported that he was dismissed 

due to discrimination. In both cases, the Employment 

Tribunal found the reports without grounds and 

concluded them in our favour. For CDC in NSW, the 

staff reported that he was bullied and harassed by 

colleagues at the workplace.

An independent investigation conducted by the 

Company could not substantiate his allegation while 

The Fair Work Commission, an industrial relations 

tribunal, and SafeWork, a government agency that 

develops policies relating to workplace health and 

safety and compensation, concluded that no action was 

necessary against the Company. The decision by the 

Anti-discrimination Board is still pending. 

Growth and Development

To sustain our business needs, we continue to recruit 

staff to cater to expansion in operations as well as fill 

vacancies due to attrition. 

In 2017, we recruited 3,360 new employees with 61% 

of them for our Singapore businesses. These new staff 

comprised 15% of our total workforce and with 86% 

being male employees. 

For the same period, 3,490 staff or close to 16% 

left the Company. Of this, close to 47% were due to 

staff reaching their retirement age or being subject 

to disciplinary proceedings. Those who left our 

employment voluntarily formed 8% of our staff strength. 

Our absenteeism rate for 2017 was 2%. 

As a Group we believe that our people are at 

the heart of our success. Be it new or experienced 

employees, we invest continually in them to develop 

their skills and talent. We ensure that they understand 

their responsibilities and are given access to necessary 

training to equip them to do their jobs better.

For non-executive staff, training is structured to 

cater to operational needs where the subjects cover 

technical aspects, regulatory, safety and soft skills. 

These include Class 4 and 5 driving, defensive driving, 

preventive maintenance, report writing and customer 

service training. For instance, in China’s Guangzhou  

Xin Tian Wei Transportation Development staff 

attended “Automated Equipment Safety Training”  

and “Service Standards and Etiquette” classes. 

Besides this, our employees participate in training 

organised by the industry or Regulator. Metroline supports 

“Hello London”, an interactive customer experience 

training for bus drivers across London, in partnership with 

Transport for London. In Singapore, our Bus Captains 

(BCs) at SBS Transit also attend foundational training at 

the Singapore Bus Academy, which was set up as part of 

the national manpower plan for the bus sector. 

Executive staff attend training sessions which are 

aimed at enhancing their functional knowledge as well as 

skills in finance, decision-making, leadership and people 

management. They also attend training to implement 

regulatory and key management programmes such as 

Occupational Health and Safety, Business Continuity 

Planning and Enterprise Risk Management. For instance, 

executives in CDC in Victoria (VIC) attended a “Managing 

Through Change” training programme while those in 

SBS Transit attended a course on “The Five Levels of 

Leadership and the 360 Degree Leader”. 

We also sponsored employees’ training in specialised 

areas. For example, SBS Transit paid for a part-time  

2½-year diploma programme in rail engineering for  

21 employees, up from 16 in 2016.

In 2017, our employees across the Group averaged 

slightly more than 28 hours of training. Male employees 

clocked in 30 hours of training while female employees 

attended 19 hours of training on average. 

Our executive level staff received on average 31 

hours of training with male executives attending 36 

hours and female executives 16 hours. Non-executive 

level staff averaged 27 hours of training with males 

attending 28 hours and females 19 hours. 

Employees are also encouraged to attain professional 

certification or be members of professional bodies to 

keep abreast of industry developments and enhance 

their professional competency. For instance, in 2017, 

Metroline’s Engineering Director, Mr Ian Foster, was elected 

to the General Council of the Institute of Road Transport 

Engineers. At SBS Transit, its rail engineers are encouraged 

to be certified as Chartered Engineers.

 As part of staff development, all employees receive 

performance and career development reviews at least 

once a year. We practise an open system in our employee 

appraisals where the supervisor conducts a one-to-one 

review with the staff based on his/her performance. 

Employees are assessed based on their competency  

and contributions while executive level staff are also 

measured on the achievement of their key performance 

tasks and targets. 

 As part of our rigorous process to ensure a steady 

pipeline of quality Management staff, our high-performing 

staff are subject to a Promotion Board to assess their 

general management, people and leadership attributes. 

Besides the psychometric tools used for recruitment, 

senior Business Unit (BU) Heads and Group Officers are 

also actively involved in the assessment and recruitment 

of high potentials. 

We also have in place various programmes and 

processes that focus on key areas, including building 

management bench strength, talent management, 

succession planning, performance management and 

compensation and benefits. 

We believe that our holistic approach in managing 

and engaging our talent will result in a more sustainable 

pipeline of future leaders who are committed, dedicated 

and able to achieve greater performance. Their enhanced 

development will give them the necessary organisational 

perspectives and adept leadership abilities to deal with 

the increasingly complex and competitive business 

environment.

Employee Engagement

We believe that engaged employees are motivated 

to do better. For this reason, ComfortDelGro actively 

engages its employees through various platforms  

and avenues.

At the start of every year, at our Corporate 

Headquarters, our Chairman and Managing Director/

Group Chief Executive Officer (MD/Group CEO) meet 

Senior Management at a breakfast meeting where they 

lay out the challenges that are expected in the months 

ahead. Action plans and strategies are also discussed at 

this annual meeting which is also attended by the Heads 

of the overseas Business Units, where possible. 

OUR PEOPLE

36  ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited


Our MD/Group CEO personally meet up with 

employees as part of the broader staff engagement 

efforts. In 2017, engagement sessions were held with 

specialist staff, employees from the Business Units 

and Union representatives. This allowed Management 

to better understand the workplace challenges, 

identify areas for improvement and also appreciate the 

contributions of our employees. 

On a regular basis, briefing sessions are organised 

by Management to share information and align business 

goals and objectives with employees. New hires attend 

an induction programme to orientate them to our 

culture, values and businesses. 

At the operational level, employees attend 

meetings and briefings on a regular basis. These 

are complemented by workshops, seminars and 

conferences. The frequency varies depending on the 

need. For instance, technicians at the various workshops 

operated by ComfortDelGro Engineering in Singapore 

attend a daily “toolbox” session conducted by their 

supervisors to be updated on the work schedules of the 

day. At Vietnam Taxi, monthly coffee talks are conducted 

by Management to hear employees share about their 

concerns and offer suggestions for improvements. 

On information related to human resource matters 

such as terms and conditions of employment, policies and 

benefits, these are available in the Employee Handbook 

which is given to all staff on their first day of work. They 

are also available on the Group’s corporate intranet. 

Besides dialogues and sharing of information, we 

also believe in recognising staff for their contributions. 

Long Service Awards are presented to staff in 

recognition of their faithful years of service to the 

Company. For example, our bus and taxi Business 

Units in Australia hand out awards to staff who have 

served for between five and 35 years. Apart from this, 

employees who provide quality service to customers 

receive recognition for their good efforts. Internal 

awards included the Employee of the Month and 

CEO commendation awards which are held either on 

a quarterly or annual basis by the different Business 

Units. At China’s Nanjing ComfortDelGro Dajian Taxi, 80 

cabbies even went on an incentive trip to Hainan Island 

in recognition of their good service. 

Our employees also receive prestigious external 

awards for their outstanding contributions. In 2017, 

Metroline’s Ms Tracey Palmer was crowned the 

Accessibility Champion at the London Bus Awards for 

her active contributions in promoting accessibility. 

Other awards received include the National  

Kindness Award - Transport Gold where more than  

220 ComfortDelGro staff in Singapore were recognised 

by the Senior Minister of State for Transport at the 

awards ceremony. 

On a global level, ComfortDelGro also recognises 

employees who go beyond their call of duty to carry 

out their jobs. It has been conferring the annual 

PASSION! Award on deserving employees since 2008 

with past winners coming from the UK, Australia, China 

and Singapore. The winner is flown into Singapore for 

the presentation of the award and also given a S$5,000 

cash prize with an all expenses paid trip to Singapore 

or one of the other six countries we operate in — 

depending on where the winner hails from. In 2017, Mr 

Liaoqi, an Operations Manager from China’s Nanning 

Comfort Transportation was the winner. Driven by 

passion in his job, he had rushed down to repair a taxi 

that had stalled at 3am during a major festive week.

More than just work, we also seek to create a positive 

environment for our people where they can have fun 

and de-stress. Monthly birthday celebrations, Christmas 

parties, annual Dinner and Dance, department lunches, 

movie screenings and excursions to places of interest 

are some of the activities organised. These activities 

also serve to foster friendships and closer ties among 

colleagues and facilitate better working relationships. In 

Victoria, CDC staff bring a dish of cultural significance 

at its “Taste of Harmony” lunch and share its cultural 

background to promote diversity and foster closer ties. 

We believe that having healthy employees is 

important to our productivity. Hence, we actively 

promote a healthy lifestyle through activities such as 

bowling competitions, cross-country runs, yoga, Zumba, 

brisk walking and jogging sessions. At the Jilin City 

International Marathon in 2017, the CEO of our North 

China Business Unit encouraged and together with 50 of 

the taxi staff participated in the marathon. In NSW, CDC 

offers discounted gym membership to its staff while SBS 

Transit sets up gyms in several of its bus depots.

Labour-Management Relations

ComfortDelGro believes in developing and sustaining a 

harmonious tripartite labour-management relationship. 

In fact, labour relations is a key function of daily life in the 

organisation. About 80% of our staff across our business 

signed new Collective Agreements.

In Singapore, bargainable employees are 

represented by the National Transport Workers’ Union 

(NTWU) which is affiliated to the National Trades Union 

Congress (NTUC) – a national confederation of trade 

unions. Executives can also opt to join the Union which 

can make limited representations on their behalf. 

Working hand-in-hand in the spirit of mutual respect 

and trust, Management and Union constantly collaborate 

to improve the welfare and well-being of employees. To 

ensure that communication channels are always kept 

open, employees are elected and appointed as Union 

representatives by Union members to provide the crucial 

link between Management and Union. 

In 2017, our Singapore businesses signed a new 

Collective Agreement with the Union, which is renewed 

once every three years. When there are major changes 

to working conditions that may affect the well-being 

of employees due to operational requirements, the 

changes to be effected are always first discussed with 

the Union. It is only when an agreement or a consensus 

is reached that the changes are announced for 

implementation. A reasonable time frame of between 

one and three months’ notice is typically given to the 

affected staff and are communicated officially in writing 

through letters, circulars or emails. Briefing sessions are 

organised to communicate the changes where needed.

REACHING OUT

REACHING OUT

At ComfortDelGro, community 

engagement is not just a 

catchphrase. It is an integral 

part of our moral fabric – 

closely intertwined with 

everything that we do. 

Our guiding principle is 

simple: Pursue benefits for both 

the business and the society 

concurrently. This two-pronged 

approach involves us finding 

ways to develop our business 

whilst creating a sustainable 

environment. In all that we do, 

we are constantly looking at 

ways in which we can help the 

communities we operate in 

to grow – in tandem with our 

businesses.

We believe that business 

should not just be governed by 

the mind – but the heart and 

soul as well. 

In our business, moving 

people between destinations is 

central to everything we do. We 

are continually looking at new 

and better ways to do this – and 

to find ways to reach out to an 

even wider range of commuters. 

The nature of our business 

involves community 

engagement in most of our 

operations. Nearly all of our 

operations have implemented 

local community engagement 

or development programmes.

But even as we deliver 

services to the communities, we 

are also mindful of any potential 

negative environmental 

or safety impact that may 

result from the roll-out of our 

operations, particularly from 

our bus and taxi businesses. 

To this end, we have, and 

continue to take, preventive 

measures including investing 

in environmentally friendly 

and technologically advanced 

vehicles as well as stepping 

up safety checks and training. 

We also reach out to the 

communities such as schools by 

conducting safety talks. 

Accessibility

As a provider of land transport 

services, accessibility is a critical 

part of our operational focus.  

We are committed to providing  

our services equitably to serve  

all customers – independent of  

age or ability. 

To this end, we operate 

wheelchair-friendly buses that  

are capable of transporting 

persons-in-wheelchairs (PIWs) 

safely and comfortably. 

In Singapore, the United 

Kingdom (UK) and Australia, 

drivers of our wheelchair-friendly 

bus services are trained to deploy 

the ramps in the correct way and 

assist the passengers. 

In Singapore and London, all our 

public scheduled bus services are 

wheelchair accessible. In Australia, 

two-thirds of the bus services 

operated by ComfortDelGro 

Corporation Australia (CDC) in New 

South Wales (NSW) and Victoria 

are wheelchair-friendly. 

Our UK subsidiary, Metroline, 

which had signed The Royal 

National Institute of Blind People’s 

accessibility charter in 2015, 

continued to hold events at its 

Cricklewood and Holloway Garages 

to help its bus drivers become more 

aware and sympathetic towards 

vision-impaired passengers. Bus 

drivers at these events put on 

“glasses” that reduce visibility 

so that they better understand 

the challenges that the visually-

impaired passengers face when 

they commute by bus. Metroline’s 

Ms Tracey Palmer was crowned 

the Accessibility Champion 

at the London Bus Awards 

for her active contributions in 

promoting accessibility.

Apart from our buses, our taxis 

also cater to people with disabilities.

In Singapore, ComfortDelGro 

Taxi cabbies are trained to assist 

PIWs in the correct way. Since 1999, 

the Company has been giving the 

disabled subsidised rides under the 

Handicare Cab Scheme. In 2017, 

ComfortDelGro Taxi subsidised 

close to S$10,000 worth of booking 

fees for 1,770 trips. To-date, we 

have subsidised a total of 67,611 

trips worth close to S$400,000. 

From 1 June 2017, the Company also 

waived the current booking fee up 

to three times a day for all guide 

dog handlers. 

CabbyCare Charity Group 

(CabbyCare), our taxi business’ 

cabby volunteer group, sponsored 

taxi vouchers to various individuals 

and organisations such as the 

Singapore Association of the 

Visually Handicapped as well as 

made over 130 free trips for the 

Children’s Cancer Foundation’s 

Wishlink Foundation, the Singapore 

General Hospital’s Amputees 

Support Group, the Kidney 

Dialysis Foundation and St Hilda’s 

Community Services Centre.

In 2017, Swan Taxis, which 

operates “Easy Access”, a service 

dedicated to passengers who 

are wheelchair users, provided 

lifting fee subsidies to taxi drivers, 

amounting to an estimated 

A$432,000 (S$450,576). It also 

channelled close to A$15,300 

(S$15,960) that was raised during 

its annual Charity Car Wash 

towards Guide Dogs WA, an 

organisation that seeks to improve 

the mobility of people living with 

blindness and vision impairment. 

In the UK, Computer Cab 

operates the Taxicard service, 

which is a scheme that provides 

subsidised travel to London 

residents with serious mobility  

or sight impairments, enabling  

them to use licensed taxis at  

a subsidised rate. 

In China, Nanjing ComfortDelGro 

Dajian Taxi and Suzhou Comfort 

38  ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited


Taxi gave the disabled free 

rides on Disability Day. Nanjing 

ComfortDelGro Dajian Taxi, 

Shanghai City Qi Ai Taxi Services 

and Chengdu ComfortDelGro 

Qing Yang Driving School also 

contributed RMB455,000 

(S$93,139) to the Employment 

Fund for the Handicapped. 

As the only driving school 

approved by the Authorities to 

train disabled students since 2010, 

Chengdu ComfortDelGro Qing 

Yang Driving School trained 84 

such students in 2017, bringing the 

total to 560 to-date. Our driving 

centre in Singapore, waived the 

membership fee of private driving 

instructors who train handicapped 

learner drivers.

Local Communities

ComfortDelGro is committed to 

community contribution in all 

geographies that we operate in 

and actively reach out to them 

through education, welfare, 

disaster relief and health. 

In 2017, the Group became 

one of 45 companies to be 

named a Champion of Good, an 

inaugural award that recognises 

large and small companies that 

have implemented sustainable 

and impactful corporate giving 

initiatives.

During the year, we continued 

to care for the poor, the elderly 

and the sick, donating over S$1 

million to various charities and 

welfare organisations. 

Serving the Elderly Poor and 

Supporting the Needy

In Singapore, the Group continued 

to contribute to NTUC Eldercare, 

which provides social day care 

services to the elderly poor. To-

date, we have contributed a total of 

S$1.73 million to this cause. 

We also continued to reach 

out to the seniors from Lions 

Befrienders Service Association 

(Singapore) (Lions Befrienders) 

through the Home Improvement 

Programme (HIP). Through the 

HIP Fund, we have been able to 

help improve the living conditions 

of the elderly poor by purchasing 

new electrical appliances as well 

as replacing old furniture with new 

ones. In 2017, over S$73,700 was 

used to purchase these items. 

ComfortDelGro staff also 

brought the Lions Befrienders 

seniors out on numerous excursions 

during the year, including visits 

to the River Safari and Christmas 

Wonderland at the Gardens by the 

Bay. For all these activities, Moove 

Media contributed goodie bags for 

the seniors and volunteers. 

In November 2017, 

ComfortDelGro Rent-A-Car 

delivered boxes consisting of basic 

necessities, including rice, oil, 

canned food, cereal, and porridge 

to 60 Lions Befrienders seniors. 

VICOM also celebrated Chinese 

New Year with seniors from Thye 

Hwa Kwan@Indus Moral and 

brought groceries for seniors from 

the Thong Keng Seniors Activity 

Centre. 

Moove Media’s subsidiary, 

GobblerCo, continued to empower 

the needy by helping them become 

their own “bosses” through its 

“Towkay” programme that was 

launched in September 2016. In 

2017, GobblerCo successfully 

trained five more towkays, bringing 

the total to eight. 

Apart from its Towkay 

programme, GobblerCo runs 

Project ROSE (an acronym for 

rice, oil, sugar and essentials) that 

helps needy single-parent families. 

These basic necessities are packed 

with other food items such as 

biscuits, canned food, beverages 

as well as personal care items like 

toothpaste to form “ROSE packs”. 

The costs of these packs are 

heavily subsidised by GobblerCo 

and purchased by corporate 

partners and the public at a 

price range between S$10 and 

S$30 before they are delivered 

to low-income, single-parent 

families through voluntary welfare 

organisations like Montfort Care, 

Project Goodwill Aid and HCSA 

Dayspring every month. Since the 

inception of Project ROSE in July 

2017, GobblerCo has delivered 

465 packages to 120 families, 

translating to over S$10,000 

worth of groceries.

Other Business Units in 

Singapore such as ComfortDelGro 

Taxi participated in several 

outreach events in support of 

various charities. For example, 

about 10 staff and taxi drivers 

took 57 hours to transform an old 

7 metres by 2.5 metres wall into a 

mural to brighten up Lee Ah Mooi 

Old Age Home. 

To support needy families 

residing in the South East District, 

over 50 staff participated in 

the 3M Step Up Challenge and 

clocked 56,229 steps in exchange 

for 113 household items, while 

about 80 staff walked 375 

kilometres to raise 3,750 bowls of 

white and brown rice for them. 

CabbyCare, continued to 

deliver meals, bread and library 

books to the needy for free.  

In all, our taxi drivers made over 

3,970 trips, valued at S$297,825  

in foregone fares. 

SBS Transit continued to  

offer free travel on the North  

East Line to the elderly 

residents of the Kwong Wai 

Shiu Hospital when they went 

on their excursions. The Group’s 

engineering arm, ComfortDelGro

REACHING OUT

Engineering, continued to provide 

maintenance services at subsidised 

rates to 11 charitable organisations 

under the National Council of 

Social Services. 

In the UK, following the 

tragic fire at the Grenfell Tower 

apartment block in London, 

near where Metroline operates, 

which resulted in an estimated 80 

deaths, Metroline donated £5,000 

(S$8,992) to support the families 

affected by the fire.

In Melbourne, CDC staff 

collected toys as well as cash 

through its Christmas Appeal 

programme in support of the 

Brotherhood of St Laurence, a 

community organisation that works 

to prevent and alleviate poverty 

across Australia. 

In China, Nanning Comfort 

Transportation distributed oil and 

rice to the needy elderly during the 

Spring Festival, while Vietnam Taxi 

(Vinataxi) continued to sponsor the 

Lawrence S. Ting Charity Walk that 

supports the poor and needy in 

Districts 7, 8, Bình Chánh and Nhà 

Bè in Ho Chi Minh City.

Engaging the Young

Apart from the elderly poor, 

children are very much on  

our minds too. 

CDC in Melbourne is a prime 

example of a Business Unit that 

actively engages the youths. In 2017, 

it pledged A$10,000 (S$10,430) 

towards providing 10 students 

from Melbourne’s West with stored 

value or MYKI cards worth A$1,000 

(S$1,043) each for travel on buses, 

trains and trams in Victoria. It also 

sponsored 33 sports scholarships to 

culturally and linguistically diverse 

(CALD) kids via various sporting 

clubs that serves the North of 

Geelong, regional Victoria. 

To clamp down on vandalism 

on its buses, CDC also collaborated 

with the Western Bulldogs’  

popular Youth Leadership 

Programme to conduct five 

“Graffiti Removal Workshops” for 

close to 100 youths. During these 

three-hour sessions, youths aged 

between 14 and 16 smeared and 

removed graffiti from a bus so that 

they could better understand how 

painstaking and costly the entire 

cleaning process was.

In China, Nanjing ComfortDelGro 

Dajian Taxi and Suzhou Comfort 

Taxi continued to provide free taxi 

trips to needy students during 

the country’s National Education 

Entrance Examination. 

In Vietnam, Vinataxi sponsored 

VND 100 million (S$5,891) towards 

the ninth Phu My Hung Children’s 

Day event, which provided 8,000 

children in Ho Chi Minh City with a 

day of fun, food and games.

Caring for the Sick

Our businesses are also firm supporters 

of non-profit organisations that look 

after the sick and the terminally-ill. 

In Singapore, ComfortDelGro Taxi 

and CabbyCare participated in the 

Children’s Cancer Foundation’s (CCF) 

Hair for Hope for the fourth year. 

As it was CCF’s 25th Anniversary, a 

record 250 taxi drivers volunteered 

to have their heads shaved. A total 

of S$50,000 was donated to CCF 

by both ComfortDelGro Taxi and 

CabbyCare, bringing the contribution 

to S$140,000 since CabbyCare 

started participating in Hair for Hope 

in 2014. 

In another activity – Hands 

to Hearts event – organised by 

ActiveSG, 43 ComfortDelGro Taxi 

staff and taxi drivers sewed pillow 

cases to raise funds in support of 

Alzheimer patients. 

Besides setting aside S$2,400-

worth of taxi vouchers for Star 

PALS, a palliative home care 

service for children and youth 

with life-threatening or life-limiting 

conditions, VICOM also reached 

out to the public through Star 

PALS donation boxes placed in its 

seven inspection centres. VICOM 

staff also brought about 40 Star 

PALS children and their parents to 

a laser tag game at Home Team 

Bukit Batok. 

Elsewhere, our businesses 

continued their support towards 

various cancer research efforts 

in cash and in kind. CityFleet 

Networks also made donations to 

Breast Cancer Now and McMillian 

Cancer, while ComfortDelGro Irish 

Citylink staff sold daffodils on 

Daffodil Day to raise funds for the 

Irish Cancer Society. 

In NSW, CDC’s Christmas buses 

continued in its efforts to raise 

funds for The Children’s Hospital at 

Westmead. The Christmas buses, 

which plied the Region 4 bus 

network from November 2017 to 

end of January 2018, raised A$1,700 

(S$1,773). CDC also donated to 

the ACT Eden Monaro Cancer 

Support Group, Dainere’s Rainbow 

Brain Tumor Research Fund, and 

provided bus services to CanTeen, 

a non-profit organisation that 

helps young people deal with the 

challenges that cancer brings.

Swan Taxis donated A$8,480 

(S$8,845) towards Cure Brain 

Cancer Foundation; Breast  

Cancer Care, and the Princess 

Margaret Hospital Foundation that 

supports children undergoing life-

threatening treatments.

OUR APPROACH  

TO SUSTAINABILITY

ComfortDelGro is committed to safeguarding the 

interests of our Stakeholders for sustainable growth, at 

the highest governance level. The Board has reviewed 

and approved the material issues, and has delegated the 

management and monitoring to Senior Management.

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 

matters as determined by our Stakeholders and 

deemed to be material to value creation are integrated 

into our balanced scorecard, which is used to set 

objectives, drive behaviours, measure performance and 

determine remuneration.

We hold ourselves to high standards of corporate 

governance and business and ethical conduct. Our 

governance policies and practices are in line with 

the principles and guidelines set out in the Code 

of Corporate Governance issued by the Monetary 

Authority of Singapore on 2 May 2012. 

We also have in place a robust Risk Management 

Framework which enables our Group and Business Units 

to understand the nature and complexity of the risks 

involved in the operations and provides a systematic 

process to identify and review the risks and prioritise 

resources to manage them.

Environmental and social issues rank high on our 

priority list which is why we have incorporated such 

considerations into our decision making processes. 

For example, we are sensitive to the levels of emissions 

of our vehicles and weigh this against costs when 

renewing our fleets. Safety considerations are also 

included in the performance assessments of our 

operations while our Group-wide Green Committee 

lead on improvements in environmental issues. Our 

risk-based approach is aligned to the precautionary 

principle. We are a proud signatory to the United 

Nations Global Compact (UNGC).

We are equally committed to respecting the privacy 

of every individual and adhering to relevant legislation 

such as the Personal Data Protection Act 2012, 

Singapore (“PDPA”). We have put in place adequate and 

robust Information Technology (IT) security systems 

and operating processes to ensure data security. The 

security measures are constantly updated to meet the 

ever-changing threat levels. Staff are also reminded of 

the need to adhere to the PDPA and to be mindful of

OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY

Risk Management 

Risk management is an important and integral part 

of the ComfortDelGro Group’s strategic planning and 

decision making process. The Group’s Risk Management 

Framework provides a systematic process for the 

Business Units to identify and review the nature and 

complexity of the risks involved in their business 

operations and to prioritise resources to manage them. 

The Group is committed to enhance shareholder value 

through growth that is sustainable and profitable and 

taking measured and well-considered risks to achieve it.

The Group’s approach to risk management is 

underpinned by several key principles:

• 

The risk management process is a continuous, 

iterative and developing one, as the Group’s 

businesses and their operating environments are 

dynamic. Risk identification and assessment and risk 

management practices are reviewed and updated 

regularly to manage risks proactively.

• 

We promote and inculcate risk awareness among 

all our employees by embedding risk management 

processes into day-to-day business operations 

and setting an appropriate tone at the top. Regular 

exercises, continuous education and training, as 

well as communications through various forums on 

risk management are carried out to sustain a risk-

informed and risk-aware culture in the Group.

• 

Ownership of and accountability for the risk 

management process is clearly defined and assigned 

to the Business Units, Departments and individuals. 

Managers at each level have intimate knowledge 

of their businesses and assume ownership of 

risk management, with stewardship retained at 

Senior Management. 

The Management Risk Committee (MRC) works 

closely with the Business Units to ensure that 

risk management is taken seriously and the Risk 

Management Framework is properly rolled out across 

the whole Group. Members of the MRC are drawn from 

Senior Management staff from the major Business Units 

and key business functions. Key risks for the Group 

are identified and presented to the Audit and Risk 

Committee (ARC) and the Board annually.

The different Business Units have different risk 

profiles and they have different programmes to manage 

the risks. The risk management programmes are

regularly tested and stressed to ensure that they remain

Some of the key risks faced by the Group, the relevant 

mitigating factors and how they are managed are set 

out below.

risk, interest rate risk, credit/counter-party risk, 

liquidity risk and fuel and electricity price risk. It is the 

Group’s policy not to participate in financial derivative 

instruments, except for use as hedging instruments, 

where appropriate. Sensitivity analysis and reviews of 

the Group’s exposure to financial risks under changing 

market conditions are carried out regularly. 

A detailed description of the financial risks and 

how the Group manages them are set out in the Notes 

to the Financial Statements on pages 80 to 167 in the 

ComfortDelGro Annual Report 2017.

Economic cycle

Changes in economic conditions in the countries that 

the Group operates in may impact the businesses in 

terms of customer demand and the cost of providing 

the services. We manage these risks by continuously 

scanning and monitoring political and economic issues. 

We monitor demand trends and operating margins 

closely. Expenses are managed in the light of revenue 

patterns and changing market conditions and to drive 

improvements in cost structures. Where possible, 

revenue risks are mitigated by diversifying revenue 

streams to non-fare sources.

Financial Risks

The Group has established internal control systems 

to safeguard its assets and regularly reviews the 

effectiveness of these controls to improve and fortify 

financial discipline. All policies and procedures on 

financial matters, including approval limits and 

authority, are clearly defined in the Group’s Financial 

Procedures Manual. 

Financial Authority Limits

Comprehensive and specific financial authority limits 

are put in place for capital expenditure, operating 

expenses, treasury matters, direct investments, revenue 

tender participation and disposal and write-off of 

assets. These authority limits are delegated based on 

the organisational hierarchy from the Board down to 

the Managing Director/Group Chief Executive Officer 

(MD/Group CEO) and the Heads of Business Units/

Departments, with the Board retaining the ultimate 

authority. Any expenditure exceeding the highest 

authority limit is referred to the Board for approval. To 

ensure that the Group’s assets continue to be managed 

prudently, the Board periodically reviews the mandate 

that it delegates to Management.

Budgetary Control

A robust and challenging Annual Budget is prepared 

and approved by the Board prior to the commencement 

of each new financial year. Material variations between 

actual and budgeted performance are reviewed on 

a monthly basis and explanations provided. Specific 

approvals are required for unbudgeted expenditures 

exceeding a relevant threshold. The capital expenditure 

budget is approved in principle by the Board as part 

of the Annual Budget. Each capital expenditure is 

subjected to rigorous justification and review before 

it is incurred in accordance with the Group’s financial 

authority limits. Tight control on manpower is exercised 

through headcount budgets.

Financial Risk Management

The Group recognises that prudent management of 

financial risks is an important aspect in the creation 

of shareholder value. The main areas of financial risks 

faced by the Group are foreign exchange/currency 

Operational Risks

Operational risks may arise from failures in internal 

controls, operational processes or the supporting 

systems. The Group has put in place operating manuals, 

standard operating procedures, authority guidelines and 

a regular reporting framework to manage these risks.

Safety

Managing the safety and security of our customers, 

our staff and the public is the cornerstone of the 

Group’s safety and security plan. We run safety 

awareness and training programmes to instil a safety 

and security conscious culture in employees at all 

levels. Safety audits are conducted regularly as part 

of the review and management process to ensure that 

safety standards are maintained. The Group works 

closely with the relevant Authorities to ensure that the 

security of our bus and train services and facilities are 

not compromised. Drills and exercises are conducted 

regularly, both internally and together with external 

agencies. Fence intrusion detection systems and other 

security features are installed at operating facilities 

and security guards deployed to patrol the facilities. 

Members of the public are encouraged to look out for 

suspicious objects or persons.

OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY

42  ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited


Environmental

The Group is committed to being a socially 

responsible organisation through minimising 

the impact our business activities have on the 

environment. Our operations, accidents and natural 

events can cause pollution or other environmental 

risks. To limit these risks, we engage in active 

environmental risk management, ensuring that we 

target the problems that could arise and implement 

preventive measures. We comply with all relevant 

regulations in the countries that we operate in. 

Ways in which the Group works to protect the 

environment can be found on pages 9 to 13 of 

this Report.

Human Resource

The Group’s ability to develop and grow the 

business internationally depends on the quality of its 

employees and it continues to invest in building up 

a resource pool to support this growth. We have in 

place various programmes and processes that focus 

on several key areas, including talent management 

and building management bench strength, 

succession planning, performance management, 

compensation and benefits, training and 

development, employee conduct and supervision, 

as well as occupational health and safety. We 

ensure that employees are selected based on 

merit, they understand their responsibilities and 

are given access to necessary training. At all times, 

a positive, constructive and productive working 

climate based on strong tripartite relations is 

fostered. All terms and conditions of employment, 

along with policies and procedures, comply with the 

relevant regulations.

Property and Liability

The Group’s exposure to property damage, business 

interruption and other liability risks is constantly 

monitored and reviewed with the Group’s in-house 

insurance broking subsidiary. Together with external 

risk management consultants, we ensure sufficiency 

of insurance coverage and maintain an optimal 

balance between risks that are retained internally 

and risks that are placed out with underwriters.

Business Continuity 

We have put in place Business Continuity Plans 

(BCPs) to mitigate the risks of disruption and 

catastrophic loss to our operations, people, 

information database and other assets. The BCPs 

include identification and planning of alternate 

recovery centres, operational procedures to 

maintain communication, measures to ensure 

continuity of critical business functions and recovery 

of information database. We update and test the 

BCPs regularly. Drills and emergency response 

exercises are conducted to familiarise employees 

with the various incident management plans. The 

BCPs enhance the Group’s operational readiness 

and resilience to potential business disruptions.

Compliance Risks

The Group keeps abreast and complies with all laws 

and regulations governing the conduct of business 

in the countries that it operates in. The businesses 

within the Group operate in regulated environment in 

different countries. These regulations include pricing, 

service standards, licences to operate and transport 

policies, which are stipulated by the relevant regulatory 

Authorities. We work closely with the regulatory 

Authorities in the respective countries as part of our risk 

management process to keep abreast of developments 

and policies that may affect our businesses and the 

competitive landscape. We manage our operations 

well and effectively to ensure that standards are met, 

thereby reducing significantly the risk of licences 

being withdrawn. 

Information Technology Risks

Information technology system failures are key risks for 

the Group since almost all the businesses rely heavily 

on information technology. This can take the form of a 

major system failure which can result in disruption of 

the business, loss of data or a security breach of our 

information technology systems. Information security 

means protecting information and information systems 

from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, 

modification or destruction. The Group’s information 

technology security management framework complies 

with current industry standards. We have put in place 

various controls and data recovery measures to mitigate 

the risks, including the use of intrusion prevention 

systems, multi-level firewalls, server protection, 

software code hardening and data loss prevention 

controls to manage Internet security and cyber threats. 

Penetration tests are carried out regularly to test the 

systems and identify potential security vulnerabilities 

and allow us to improve the security hardening of our 

websites. Information security policies and procedures, 

including education for all staff, are reviewed and 

enhanced regularly.

Sustainability Report 2017  43


Strategic Risks

We evaluate each new investment proposal to 

ensure that it is in line with the Group’s strategy 

and investment objective and it can meet the 

relevant hurdle rates of return. This assessment 

includes macro and project specific risks 

analysis covering feasibility study, due diligence, 

financial modelling and sensitivity analysis of key 

investment assumptions and variables. To ensure 

that the rate of return on any new investment or 

business opportunity commensurate with the risk 

exposure taken, the new investment opportunity 

is evaluated in terms of (a) profitability; (b) return 

on investment; (c) pay back period; (d) cash flow 

generation; (e) potential for internal and external 

growth; and (f) investment climate and political 

stability of the country. The investment proposal 

has to be approved according to the financial 

authority limits approved by the Board.

Code of Business Conduct and Whistle 

Blowing Policy

The Group has adopted a Code of Business Conduct 

which sets out the principles and policies upon which 

our businesses are conducted, as well as implemented 

a Whistle Blowing Policy to provide a mechanism for 

employees to raise concerns, through well-defined 

and accessible confidential disclosure channels 

about possible improprieties in financial reporting or 

other improper business conduct including potential 

corruption or human rights infringes. Employees are 

given a Company handbook detailing how they can 

go about raising their concerns. Incidents can also 

be reported through a direct link to the MD/Group 

CEO, the Group Human Resource Officer or the 

Group Internal Audit Officer on the Group’s Intranet. 

All cases are investigated and dealt with promptly 

and thoroughly.

In 2017, there was no incident of corruption reported. 

ComfortDelGro has no political affiliations nor did it 

make any political contributions in 2017. 

Audit Process

The Internal and External Auditors conduct reviews 

in accordance with their audit plans. In the course 

of their audits, the Internal and External Auditors 

highlight to the ARC and Management areas where 

there are material deficiencies and weaknesses 

or the occurrence of significant risk events and 

propose mitigating measures and treatment 

plans. Non-compliance and recommendations for 

improvements are reported to the ARC, which 

reviews the effectiveness of the actions taken 

to mitigate the risks. The recommendations are 

followed up as part of the Group’s continuous 

review of the system of internal controls.

Opinion of the Board

Risk management is an important and integral part of 

ComfortDelGro’s strategic planning and decision-making 

process. Key risks are identified and presented to the 

Board annually. Ownership of the risk management 

process is clearly defined and cascaded to the executive 

and functional level, with stewardship retained at 

Senior Management. Action plans that are necessary to 

manage the risks are in place and closely monitored. The 

adequacy of the risk governance, risk policy and internal 

controls in place is also assessed as part of the process. 

Based on these reviews, the Board is of the view, with 

the concurrence of the ARC, that there are adequate 

and effective internal controls in place within the Group 

to address its financial, operational, compliance and 

information technology risks.
