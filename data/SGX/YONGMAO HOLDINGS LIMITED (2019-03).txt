About

this report

As the second Sustainability Report (the “report”) published by Yongmao, this report continues to disclose the policies, 

practices, targets and performances of the Group in terms of the material environmental, social and governmental 

factors that the Group has identified. The report aims to enable all stakeholders to understand the progress and 

sustainability directions of the Group.

reporting boundary

The report focuses on Yongmao’s operation of design, development, manufacture and sale of tower cranes, components 

and accessories between April 2018 and March 2019 (the “reporting year”, or FY2019). The reporting boundary covers 

the Beijing and Fushun production facilities in the PRC and its Singapore office, which is consistent with the reporting 

boundary in the first Sustainability Report. While the report does not fully cover the Group’s operations (such as the 

sales and rental business operations in Hong Kong), Yongmao plans to consistently refine the internal data collection 

process and gradually expand the scope of disclosure in the coming reporting years. 

reporting standard

The report is prepared in accordance with the ‘comply or explain’ provisions of SGX-ST Listing Rules 711 on sustainability 

reporting, as well as the guidance set out in the Practice Note 7.6: Sustainability Reporting Guide (“PN 7.6”) issued by the 

SGX. The five reporting components prescribed by the SGX-ST Listing Rules 711B (“LR 711B”) underline the key structure 

of this report. It takes reference from the sustainability reporting framework provided by Global Reporting Initiatives 

(“GRI”), the GRI Standards (version 2016 and 2018). The disclosures in this report seek to achieve the GRI’s Reporting 

Principles for defining report quality – accuracy, balance, clarity, comparability, reliability, and timeliness. 

To ensure the reporting quality and credibility, Yongmao commissioned an external consulting company to conduct 

stakeholder engagement and report compilation. In line with the material topics confirmed during the stakeholder 

engagement process, selected topic-specific disclosures are included for enhanced reporting. A complete GRI-SGX 

Content Index is inserted in the last section.

ChAirMAn’s 

MessAGe

With the concept of sustainability increasingly recognized by people from all walks of life, it is vital for enterprises to 

attach greater importance to balance economic, social and environmental values in their operations. This requires 

Yongmao to adopt a holistic approach to steer our relationship with the community and the environment in an effective 

and responsive manner. 

It is undeniable that climate change is imposing impacts on humanity and the natural environment. Unregulated 

industrial activities have disturbed the balance in the ecosystem and are affecting the health and well-being of the 

human race. To proactively manage against any potential negative impacts, Yongmao has been exploring niche business 

opportunities through new manufacturing design and technological innovation, which demonstrates our capacity of 

advancing environmental efficacy through the Group’s operations.

Due to the nature of the business, the Group pays great attention to the saving of raw materials in daily operations. 

The Group has started improving the utilization rate of steel through the upgrading of design and research. At present, 

the steel utilization rate can reach 83%-90%. With tightened national requirements on environmental protection, the 

Group also strives to fulfill our strong commitments to environmental compliance. As part of our strategy in corporate 

responsibility, we continue to support available means of local procurement and adopt locally-sourced renewable 

materials in our production process.

In terms of the social aspects of sustainability, the Group focuses on enhancing practices in occupational health 

and safety, product quality and anti-corruption. To effectively manage the Group’s potential impacts in these areas, 

Yongmao has adopted a range of measures, such as established safety committees, upgrading technical capabilities, 

signing integrity agreements with suppliers, and so forth.

In addition, Yongmao values community investment activities, especially in the area of youth development with 

education and entrepreneurship. The Group has established the Yongmao Entrepreneurship Fund (“永茂创业基金”) to 

encourage college students in nearby areas (such as Shenyang and Fushun) to start up their own businesses. Ongoing 

donations have been contributed to education support schemes for local college students.  

Actively responding to China’s international development strategy of the Belt and Road Initiative, the Group strives to 

scale up globalized branding of Yongmao’s products. To support this goal, Yongmao also seeks to design, develop and 

manufacture innovative, smart and green tower cranes that meet the demands of the construction and the shipbuilding 

industries.

sustainability Governance

The Group understands the importance of sound corporate governance and operation practices to the Group’s long-

term development that overcomes sustainability challenges. The Board is responsible for considering sustainability 

issues as part of the strategic formulation. In addition, the Board works with Yongmao’s key managerial personnel to 

achieve sustainability objectives and the managerial personnel should report relevant issues to the Board in a timely 

manner.

In order to provide an independent oversight and discharge its responsibilities more efficiently and to ensure that specific 

issues are subject to consideration and review before the Board makes its decisions, the Board has delegated certain 

functions to various Board Committees, including the Audit Committee, Nominating Committee and Remuneration 

Committee. During the reporting year, the Group’s Audit Committee has held four internal meetings and all directors 

of the Board have attended.

sustainability risks and opportunities

The Board is responsible for identifying and managing risks and should ensure that the Group’s operations apply a 

solid system of risk management and internal controls to safeguard shareholders’ interests and the company’s assets, 

as well as to address concerns from wider stakeholder groups. The Board should also determine the nature and extent 

of the significant risks that the Group is willing to take to achieve its strategic objectives.

Yongmao considers risk management as an integral part of operational management and resource planning to meet 

with increasing demands for sustainability. Taking into account the potential impacts of material sustainability topics 

on operation and strategic planning, the Group has identified some potential risks and opportunities with the support 

of external consultants.

 



Months of intense preparatory work 

from our employees culminates in 

triumph, as yet another tower crane 

receives the CE Mark certification 

from an inspector from TÜV SÜD 

Industrie Service GmbH. The CE Mark 

certification process is a key step in our 

product development cycle.

risks

responses and opportunities

Supply Chain Management

Potential loopholes in managing 

the supply chain directly affect 

the product quality for customers, 

safety for the general public around 

construction sites and production 

safety for workers at Yongmao.

Procurement Quality Assurance and Supplier Selection Procedures

The Group signs Procurement Product Quality Agreements with 

suppliers to specify the quality requirements for the products supplied 

by them, including technical specifications, regular inspections and 

the product recall process. The group has set up stringent supplier 

selection policies and practices to ensure the fair and transparent 

selection of quality suppliers.

Product Development

Product development that becomes 

ineffective or disconnected from 

market demands for sustainability 

threatens the Group’s ability to meet 

or exceed customers’ needs.

Product Quality Assurance

Yongmao has developed practices in various ways to maintain quality 

assurance in the product development stage, by improving the Group’s 

technical ability, participating in industry associations, understanding 

market and clients’ requests, improving the standardization of products 

during the design stage, and purchasing product liability insurance.

Environmental Risks

Extreme weather events and natural 

disasters can impose impacts on the 

operations and service delivery of 

the Group (for instance, production 

halt due to cold waves or defaults in 

delivered products due to frequent 

typhoons). Other risks to managing 

environmental changes include raw 

material usage, energy and water 

usage and emission controls.

Strengthening Resilience

The Group has been strictly managing the environmental impact of its 

daily production in accordance with the latest national policies related to 

environmental protection. Environmental aspects can present not only 

risks but also opportunities to the Group, for example, the Group actively 

manages the utilization rate of raw material steel which helps tackle 

environmental problems and improve our economic performance at the 

same time. By advancing the design standards of our tower crane products 

to meet the challenges of extreme weather events, Yongmao has attained a 

market niche and acquired business opportunities for sustainable growth. 

Occupational Health and Safety 

The Group is vulnerable to 

occupational health and safety 

risks in its daily operations, such as 

occupational deafness and fractures.

Improving Employee Well-being and Health

The Group has provided employees with personal protective equipment, 

regular safety training and fire drills to prevent work-related injuries and ill 

health.

Employee Retention

Talent loss and an undesirable 

turnover rate may have negative 

impacts on the stability, morale and 

creativity of our staff.

Enhancing Corporate Culture 

Yongmao places emphasis on leadership training with staff of growth 

potentials. Annual performance reviews of employees are linked to annual 

bonus and promotion. On the other hand, staff engagement activities have 

been regularly organised to promote a postive and inclusive company 

culture. Heads of Departments are also equipped with skills and knowledge 

in understanding employee needs (both mental and physical) and to 

provide sufficient support for general staff.

CoMpetitiVeness 

The Group understands that economic performance is the basis for business survival, which also affects the well-being 

of and relationship with different stakeholders. Ensuring the organic and steady growth of the Group’s outputs and 

economic values has always been a core agenda of different functional units in Yongmao.

overview of economic performance

The Group’s revenue experienced a 35.5% rise year-on-year to RMB885.4 million in FY2019, as compared to RMB653.5 

million in FY2018. Meanwhile, the average gross profit margin decreased from 29.0% in FY2018 to 27.0% in FY2019. On 

the other hand, in absolute figures, the Group’s gross profit rose 26.0% year-on-year to RMB238.7 million in FY2019, 

as compared to RMB189.5 million in FY2018. Consequently, net profit attributable to equity holders increased from 

RMB27.6 million in FY2018 to a more robust RMB61.5 million in FY2019.

Continuous innovation and developing state-of-the-art tower cranes is the core aspect of the Group’s business and in 

line with the strategy of building and leveraging on the brand’s reputation. In FY2019, the Group’s intense research and 

development efforts continued to bear fruit, leading to the emergence of the STT3930 tower crane to the fore, the latest 

addition to the existing mega-sized topless tower crane series. It was designed to be highly suited for a wide range of 

mega-scale construction projects, including nuclear and thermal power plants, bridges, airports, high-speed railways 

and marine ports.

Future Development

In a bid to mitigate the US-China trade war’s effects, the Chinese government has announced that it would ramp 

up infrastructure spending by RMB1.35 trillion. In addition, the prefabricated construction method in the PRC is also 

continuing to take root, and the Chinese government is targeting for 30 per cent of newly added buildings to be 

prefabricated by 2026.

Over in Singapore, local regulators have also prepared initiatives that are likely to give Prefabricated Prefinished 

Volumetric Construction (“PPVC”) a further boost. An upcoming Off-site Construction Special Scheme is set to reduce 

labor costs at prefabrication facilities, while the SGD295 million Productivity Innovation Project scheme will help lower 

the adoption costs of technologies that improve productivity and reengineer work processes, including PPVC.

Looking ahead into FY2020, the Group has set out further quantifiable targets to measure and report on the economic 

performances:

procurement practices 

To manage the Group’s supply chain in an effective and responsible way, the Group has established the well-defined 

Materials (Equipment) Procurement Tender Management Procedures, in order to strengthen the Group’s procurement 

management. The Group has established an Equipment (Materials) Procurement and Tender Management Team 

(the “Procurement Management Team”), with the General Manager as the group leader and Heads of Departments in 

procurement, production, sales and research and development as group members. The Procurement Management 

Team is also responsible for the following issues:

•	

validation, approval of procurement plans and tendering projects;

•	

examination and approval of procurement tendering methods and evaluation methods;

•	

determining the bid evaluation team and its relevant staff; and

•	

final confirmation of the successful bidder. 

Bidders shall submit information on technical standards, specifications, quality requirements, supply methods and 

delivery times of the materials when submitting their bids. Besides, the Group requires suppliers to have ISO9001 

quality system certification or other corresponding qualifications.

In order to ensure the fairness of the bidding process, the Procurement Management Team first determines the 

composition of the members in the Bid Evaluation Team in accordance with predefined policy terms. For instance, 

professional and technical staff shall take up at least two-thirds of the total number of members in the Bid Evaluation 

Team and no personnel with conflict of interests shall be selected into this team. Any organizations or individuals are 

prohibited from illegal interference with the process and results of the bid evaluation. 

Yongmao’s procurement policy also stipulates a code of professional practices for the employees. Employees or 

external bidders violating bidding provisions or engaging in bribery or illegitimate exchanges of benefits may cause 

fines or the termination of business contracts. The Group will conduct internal investigations, and reserves the right to 

report any suspected criminal involvement in bidding-related activities to the relevant authorities.

The procurement of raw materials forms an integral step in our 

supply chain, and a stringent procurement framework is built in 

place to ensure a fair, equitable procurement process.

Responsible operations entail various aspects of practices 

in the Group’s value chain, from sound management 

of procurement practices, to effective prevention of 

commercial corruption activities when dealing with 

business partners, competitors and regulatory agencies. 

Yongmao has formulated a range of management 

approaches to affirm values for integrity, fairness and 

partnership, which resulted in positive progress in the 

prescribed commitments and targets.

occupational health and safety

Yongmao cares about health and safety of our employees across the Group’s business operations. The Group has put 

together a set of established procedures in its Safety Management System, which serves as a guidance for different 

departments and production lines to implement health and safety measures. Safety at Yongmao has been treated 

as a serious issue in which employees of all levels have a role to play, in a collective effort to build a safe working 

environment.

The management team of Yongmao plays a key role in maintaining the Safety Management System with a clear 

description of responsibilities. The compiled procedures in the Safety Management System define the role and 

responsibility of management including overseeing workplace safety as well as formulate detailed processes and 

procedures to ensure a safe and secure environment for all workers. The policies stated in the Safety Management 

System are in line with local regulations and laws.

The employees take the safety education exam once a year, and the test results are recorded in their personal profile.

the enVironMent

The Group understands that the essence of sustainable development is to meet the needs of the present generation 

without compromising the quality of life of the future generations, and therefore strives to minimise the adverse 

environmental impacts brought by its business operations at all times. Yongmao’s Procurement Product Quality 

Agreement demonstrates its efforts in environmental protection through managing resources used and acquired in 

the procurement process.

Materials 

Due to the nature of operations, the Group generates waste materials such as steel material offcut and iron filings 

during the production process. To maximise the utilisation rate of raw materials and reduce waste, the Group collects 

waste materials at designated recycle bins for recycling. Part of the steel material offcut will be used for manufacturing 

the counterweight of the tower crane. The remaining materials are disposed for recycling.

The Group has a policy in place setting forth the proper procedures to handle production waste. All waste materials, 

such as iron filings and carton boxes, are dispensed and sold to qualified waste treatment vendors contracted by the 

Group through competitive bidding processes. The Waste Management Department of the Group is responsible for 

overseeing the coordination, approval and processing of the waste materials.
