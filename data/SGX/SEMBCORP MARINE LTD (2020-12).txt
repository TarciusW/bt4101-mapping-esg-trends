CHAIRMAN’S

FOREWORD

The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 certainly 

brought to the fore the importance of 

sustainability and even hastened the momentum 

of business and sustainability transformation of 

many organisations.

At Sembcorp Marine, we take a comprehensive 

approach to sustainability, anchored on our core 

values to achieve our stakeholders’ immediate 

and longer term objectives. Sustainability 

is integrated into the Group’s strategy and 

embedded into the fabric of how we operate and 

conduct our business.

Since 2015, the Group has strategically aligned 

our businesses towards a cleaner energy mix. Our 

foresight is now validated by the global pandemic 

and energy transition due to climate concerns. 

We continue to drive sustainability in our business 

and community with a keen focus on four 

strategic areas, namely decarbonisation, ocean 

sustainability, digitalisation and social growth. 

These four pillars of our sustainability pursuit 

remain highly relevant in the face of today’s 

challenges.

As we look back at COVID-19 in 2020, our focus 

on safety and continuity in yard operations 

enabled us to act swiftly and decisively to protect 

our employees, customers, business partners and 

communities where we operate. We activated 

our Business Continuity Plan for Pandemics, 

ahead of the implementation of national 

pandemic containment measures, and initiated 

work team segregation, which quickly evolved to 

standing down of operations and arrangements 

to work from home. We are thankful that our yard 

operations have resumed reasonably smoothly 

since July 2020. 

We have clear ambitions with our Vision 2025 

strategic roadmap for Sembcorp Marine’s 

sustainable growth. Among our goals for the 

next five years, we target to generate 30% of our 

revenue from sustainable products and solutions 

by 2025.

We know we have a responsibility and the 

opportunity to contribute to a more sustainable 

world. As we forge ahead in engineering our 

growth, we are resolved to continue to take a 

proactive stance in sustainability, to create real 

positive sustainable impact and achieve our 

stakeholders’ objectives.  

Tan Sri Mohd Hassan Marican

Chairman

Sembcorp Marine Ltd

We continue to drive sustainability in our

today’s challenges.

SEMBCORP MARINE

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

In 2020, we conducted an internal materiality review2 with our sustainability champions. The review 

confirmed that our current list of seven material topics remain relevant to Sembcorp Marine and our 

stakeholders. We used a materiality matrix to assess the relative importance and priority of our material 

topics. Based on inputs from both internal and external stakeholders, there is an increasing importance 

of Innovation &amp; Sustainable Solutions and Environmental Sustainability while Business Integrity and Total 

Workplace Safety and Health remain the most important material topics for the Group.

SHARING INSIGHTS WITH THE PUBLIC SECTOR  

TO DRIVE INDUSTRY RECOVERY

Sembcorp Marine works in close partnership with public sector agencies to drive the recovery 

for the marine, offshore and energy industries. On 9 November 2020, we hosted a ministerial 

delegation comprising Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade and Industry, and  

Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister for Manpower, to Tuas Boulevard Yard.

During the walkabout and dialogue session held as part of the visit, our Chairman Tan Sri  

Mohd Hassan Marican, President &amp; CEO Mr Wong Weng Sun, and key management 

representatives shared insights into the Group’s COVID-19 response and strategic initiatives  

for sustainable growth. 

In his ministerial address, Minister Chan commended industry players such as Sembcorp 

Marine for their continuous investments to “build up capabilities for the long term” and “groom 

their engineering talent”. This has enabled the Group to pivot into new areas such as Liquefied 

Natural Gas (LNG), offshore wind as well as smart and digital products, in line with the growing 

demand for cleaner, greener and renewable energy solutions.

for Trade and Industry, and Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister 

for Manpower, on the Group’s integrated solutions and

Augmenting our Technology Bench Strength 

and Capabilities

Sembcorp Marine’s strategic initiatives to expand 

its capabilities for sustainable growth include: 

Gas Innovation and Solutions Centre 

• Focusing on design and engineering 

capabilities for LNG-battery hybrid tugs, 

LNG bunkering vessels and Gravifloat-

based LNG refuelling terminals 

Post-graduate Programme 

• Supporting employees’ development 

in emerging areas such as hydrogen 

liquefaction process and transport, 

electrification and autonomous systems 

Professional Conversion Programme 

• Reskilling and upskilling employees with 

new expertise and know-how

“With this kind of challenges on the horizon, 

it is therefore very important for our industry 

to have the engineering capabilities to 

pivot to new areas …. Sembcorp Marine 

(has) continued to invest in and build up 

capabilities for the long term, and … groom 

their engineering talent to make sure that 

they are ready for future projects.”

Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade and Industry

“(Firms) are also moving into new business 

areas and understand the importance 

of sustainability. The new 3Ds are 

decarbonisation, dealing with disruption 

and digitalisation.”

PROACTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN 

MANAGEMENT FOR 

BUSINESS CONTINUITY

The global disruptions caused by 

the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 

highlighted the importance of a 

sustainable and resilient supply 

chain that is enabled by robust 

digital procurement platforms  

and solutions.

Supply chain disruptions arising 

from pandemic control measures 

and restrictions by governments 

impacted business activities, 

receipt of goods and services,  

and global transportation routes. 

This had affected the ability 

of suppliers to manufacture, 

distribute and deliver materials, 

equipment packages, 

consumables and services from 

and to pandemic-affected areas.

Limitations to manufacturing 

capabilities also caused 

uncertainties in production,  

price and market availability. 

In this volatile supply chain 

environment, Sembcorp Marine 

responded proactively to address 

the impacts and implemented risk 

mitigations where needed.

Building on robust sustainability 

processes in our supply chain 

management framework, 

we implement strategies to 

mitigate disruptions, ensure 

business continuity and maintain 

competitiveness. Digital 

platforms and technologies are 

also deployed for procurement 

process continuity and interface 

with partners and stakeholders.

SUPPLY CHAIN

We proactively monitor the 

supply and pricing of key 

materials, equipment and 

consumables as well as 

sourcing restrictions imposed 

by government authorities to 

identify potential risks in our 

supply chain.

As part of our strategy to 

buffer against supply chain 

disruptions, we deploy strategic 

frame agreements with key 

suppliers to secure essential 

supplies for our operations. 

Our global supply network 

enables access to diversified 

procurement channels 

and sources in different 

geographies, enabling us 

to meet shipping and trade 

restrictions. We also partner 

local suppliers to leverage 

their local inventory and 

supply sources.

We work closely with 

authorities to ensure 

undisrupted supply of 

essential services — such 

as waste treatment, freight 

forwarding, shipping-related 

logistics and maintenance 

services for our operations.

We continue our due 

diligence and actively 

monitor suppliers’ financial 

health and their ability to 

deliver to specifications 

and comply with our 

sustainability requirements 

and codes of conduct. This 

is especially important when 

alternative suppliers or 

geographical sources  

are used.

Quality assurance on 

suppliers’ production and 

factory acceptance tests 

(FAT) are conducted via 

remote video surveillance 

solutions to ensure 

continued compliance to 

technical requirements and 

industry standards.

These solutions enable us to 

uphold consistent standards 

of compliance and to 

meet emergent regulatory 

restrictions imposed 

by different countries’ 

authorities in challenging 

operating conditions.

MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

Managing a sustainable 

and resilient supply chain 

requires close engagement 

and collaboration with our 

stakeholders, especially 

during periods of disruptions.

We engage our suppliers 

to closely monitor the 

availability of key materials, 

equipment and consumables 

to identify possible 

disruption points in the 

supply chain. 

Recovery plans are 

developed to mitigate 

areas of supply and delivery 

disruptions to our project 

and production processes. 

We also support our 

suppliers to help them

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

At Sembcorp Marine, we carefully and proactively 

manage each stage of the life-cycle of our products 

and solutions — from design and engineering 

to production and delivery — to mitigate our 

environmental, social and governance impacts.  

We use resources more efficiently by transforming 

a traditionally linear business process into a circular 

value chain through continuous innovation.

Sustainable products and solutions are 

conceptualised at the innovation and solutions 

development phase of our value chain. We 

incorporate sustainability and material circularity 

objectives into our product designs by adopting 

more efficient solutions and proactively 

managing hazardous materials. Similarly, during 

procurement, our teams source for sustainable 

materials and socially responsible service providers 

and contractors. 

After final production, construction and 

commissioning, we transport and deliver the 

completed products with our low-carbon fleet 

and provide training and documentation support 

for customers to operate their assets in a safer 

and more resource-efficient manner. Through 

repair, upgrade and conversion projects, we give 

our customers’ existing assets a second lease 

of life, thus contributing to their sustainability 

objectives. We also help our customers prepare 

their end-of-life assets for safe and efficient 

recycling and scrapping. 

At each stage of our value chain, we uphold 

high standards of quality, health, safety and 

environmental compliance in all aspects of our 

operations.

OUR WORK IN 2020

Largest membrane type LNG bunker vessel in Asia

The 12,000 cubic metre GTT Mark III Flex membrane tanks 

are the largest ever built in Singapore and the rest of Asia. 

This state-of-the-art design allows for safe transfer of LNG 

during bunkering operations as well as reducing loss of 

cryogenic LNG through evaporation. This vessel also boasts 

an optimised vessel hull form using computational fluid 

dynamics (CFD) as shown on the left, and energy-efficient 

designs that effectively reduce carbon emissions during 

operation.

Floating offshore wind turbine solution for moderate  

to harsh environment based on the SWACH design

As the offshore wind market is moving into deeper and 

harsher environments with larger turbines, our subsidiary, 

Sevan SSP, developed a cost-efficient floating foundation 

for offshore wind turbines. Based on our proprietary Sevan 

SWACH (Small Waterplane Area Cylindrical Hull) design, 

the cylindrical floating foundation solution is scalable to 

house the largest wind turbines and offers excellent motion 

characteristics in harsh conditions.

Work Boat World Best of 2020 Awards “Best Medium  

Ro-Pax” design – Hjellestad 

Hjellestad, an aluminium hybrid plug-in double-ended ferry 

LMG-16-DEH, designed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, 

LMG Marin, won the Best Medium Ro-Pax Award at the 

Work Boat World awards. This ferry, which accommodates 

16 cars and 80 passengers, is powered by a biodiesel and 

electrical propulsion system. The lithium-ion batteries 

onboard are charged by onshore hydroelectric power, 

reducing the emissions of vessel operation to zero.

Strength through collaboration – Bringing ideas to life

In February 2020, Sembcorp Marine inked a Master 

Research Collaborative Agreement (MRCA) with 

Singapore’s Agency of Science, Technology and Research

SEMBCORP MARINE

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

Marine and offshore assets are capital intensive and often operate under harsh environment. 

To ensure the safety of the crew, the environment and the asset, we design, build and deliver 

our products and solutions according to stringent international standards. These regulatory 

and statutory requirements include among others Norwegian’s NORSOK standard, UK HSE 

requirements, Norwegian Maritime Authority Regulations as well as the Code for Construction 

and Equipment of Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODU).

The responsibility to ensure these regulations are met lies with a dedicated team of regulatory 

compliance and technical safety engineers who are involved in every stage of the project. 

Using tools such as standard operating procedures, flowcharts, checklists and experience 

transfer from past projects, our engineers continuously innovate their work processes to 

execute projects seamlessly. As new regulations addressing different aspects of Health, Safety 

and Environment are introduced periodically, our team undergoes regular competency 

development courses to be kept up-to-date and relevant.

In addition to safety and environmental regulations, Sembcorp Marine is also cognisant of the 

need to secure solutions and protect assets from cyberspace threats. To this end, we have 

developed competencies in implementing cybersecurity requirements, including the Cyber 

Manage Prepared (CMP) notation from Bureau Veritas which we have done for a newbuild 

LNG carrier to meet the IMO’s Resolution MSC (98).

CREATING EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE 

COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS

In 2020, Sembcorp Marine and our consortium partner GE’s Grid Solutions were selected by RWE 

Renewables, owner of the 1.4 gigawatt Sofia Offshore Wind Farm, as the preferred supplier for the 

Wind Farm’s High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) electrical transmission system. Our scope of work 

includes the design, construction, installation and commissioning of the offshore converter platform 

for the project. We have started early design works and expect the Final Investment Decision (FID) to 

be made in the first quarter of 2021.

Located on the Dogger Bank, 195 km off the UK coast in the Central North Sea, Sofia spans an area 

of 593 km2. With a capacity of 1.4 gigawatt that will power nearly 1.2 million UK homes with clean and 

renewable energy, Sofia will be one of the largest wind farms in the world.

Sembcorp Marine is continuing with the pre-FID  

engineering work for Siccar Point Energy  

Cambo FPSO in anticipation of development 

sanction on the project in late 2021. We are very 

delighted to work with Siccar Point since 2019 

in developing an innovative cylindrical FPSO for 

the Cambo field. This is another unique design- 

and-build project where the solution is based on 

our proprietary Sevan geostationary circular hull, 

a cost-effective alternative to traditional ship-

shaped and turret-moored designs. The Sevan 

cylindrical hull eliminates the need for a costly 

turret while accommodating a larger number of 

risers and flexibility for future tie-ins.





In 2020, Sembcorp Marine is also pleased to have collaborated with the Defence Science and Technology  

Agency (DSTA), Singapore, on a concept based on an existing proven design by LMG Marin.

embarked on climate programmes to reduce the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in our operations 

and continue to design and deliver sustainable solutions for our customers.

This year, we have started to align our disclosures with those recommended by the Task Force on 

Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), specifically our approach to address the four core 

elements – governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets. We plan to provide 

further disclosures on this in the future. We are also enhancing our environmental policy to guide 

our management approach and strategy on issues such as climate change mitigation, adaptation and 

resilience, and ensure that it is implemented across our various operational sites.

In this report, we voluntarily publish our climate-related financial disclosures in the four key areas as 

recommended by the TFCD.

Sembcorp Marine’s Board of Directors 

and Senior Management Committee 

(SMC) have oversight of climate-related

The Sustainability Secretariat reports to 

the Sustainability Council and coordinates 

with the Economic, Environmental, Social 

and Governance (EESG) working groups 

to implement strategies, identify emerging 

issues and engage our stakeholders on 

sustainability issues, including climate-

related matters. 

To guide the Group’s strategic direction, the 

Board and SMC meet annually to review key 

business plans while taking into account 

climate-related risks and opportunities.

identified policy and regulation changes, 

technological shifts, evolving stakeholder 

expectations, and growing thread of 

extreme weather events as key climate-

related risks.

In keeping with the global and industry shift 

towards decarbonisation, we proactively 

leverage our engineering capabilities to 

diversify into gas value chain and renewables 

solutions, including offshore wind farms 

and zero-emission vessels. We also pursue 

opportunities in energy-efficient and low-

emission engineering solutions to help ship 

owners comply with more stringent fuel 

and emission regulations through retrofits 

and upgrades.

Moving forward, we plan to conduct 

scenario analysis to evaluate the resilience 

of our business strategy against climate-

related risks and opportunities for different 

time horizons.

Our energy sources include electricity, diesel, LPG, CNG, acetylene and solar energy.

(8) Net calorific values (NCV) were sourced from WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol Emission Factors for Cross Sector Tools 

(March 2017). NCV for acetylene was referenced from S. McAllister et al., Fundamentals of Combustion Processes (2011).

“ – “ Figures for Indonesia and Brazil were not available for 2018.

Our total energy consumption in FY2020 amounted to 1.266 million GJ, a 10% reduction compared to 

our consumption in 2019. This is primarily attributed to the reduced operations in FY2020 across the 

yards. Our energy intensity for the same period was 0.021 GJ/man-hour6.

(9) Operational control approach is used to identify the GHG emissions. The boundaries of our reported emissions currently comprise our 

shipyards operating in Brazil, Indonesia and Singapore, excluding joint ventures.

(10) Emission factors (EF) were sourced from WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol Emission Factors for Cross Sector Tools (March 

2017). The scope 1 calculations for 2018 have been restated due to revised emission factors used for the fuels. Only CO2, CH4 and N2O 

emissions are included in the calculation of direct GHG emissions. Global Warming Potential (GWP) factors used are from the 2014 

IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. Emission data is derived from combustion of non-renewable fuels consumed in our yards and follows 

the requirement of GHG Protocol.

(11) Grid EF for Singapore was obtained from Energy Market Authority (EMA), grid EF for Brazil and Indonesia were obtained from Institute 

for Global Environmental Strategies (2019) – List of Grid Emission Factors version 10.6. Scope 2 emissions for Singapore for 2018 and 

2019 have been restated based on latest Grid EF obtained from Energy Market Authority (EMA). Only CO2 emissions are included in 

the calculation of indirect GHG emissions. Emissions data is derived from purchased electricity consumed in our yards and follows the 

requirement of GHG Protocol.

SEMBCORP MARINE

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

Steel, copper, welding materials and 

paint products are key raw materials 

used during our operations. We adopt 

sustainable practices and processes 

during the life-cycle stages of every 

project to optimise the use of resources. 

We have expanded the scope of reporting 

this year for material consumption to 

also include welding consumables, 

paint and thinner used by the Group. 

In FY2020, the total amount of steel, 

copper grits, steel grits, steel shots and 

welding consumables used by the Group 

amounted to 229,110 metric tonnes and 

the total amount of paint and thinner used 

is 938,905 litres.

All our yards have implemented strict 

policies on waste management to ensure 

environmentally responsible waste disposal 

processes in compliance with the local 

regulations. These processes include 

the use of licensed waste management 

vendors and proper waste segregation. 

Municipal water and recycled water 

(NEWater – used in Singapore yards) are 

the two main sources of water used in our 

business operations. Besides conducting 

regular monitoring and leak checks in 

our yards’ water pipe network, we create 

awareness on water conservation and 

advocate responsible consumption of this 

precious resource. In FY2020, we used 

2.196 million m3 of water.

Our solutions operate globally in all kinds 

of water conditions, including the fragile 

Arctic Ocean. Starting from 31 December 

2020, the EU Ship Recycling Regulation (EU 

SRR) came into force and required vessels 

of 500 GT and above flying the flag of an 

European Union/European Economic Area 

(EU/EEA) member state, or third-party-

flagged vessels calling at European ports 

to have a valid Inventory of Hazardous 

Material (IHM) certificate. To assist ship 

owners and managers, we minimise the 

use of hazardous materials during the 

design and engineering phase and support 

our customers in developing the IHM 

documentation.

In 2020, the United Nations Global 

Compact (UNGC) developed practical 

guidance for shipyards to align their 

operations to deliver on the nine 

sustainable ocean principles. The ocean 

principles cover three broad areas: i) Ocean 

Health and Productivity, ii) Governance and 

Engagement, iii) Data and Transparency. 

Sembcorp Marine, recognised as a key 

stakeholder, was invited to join the 

taskforce to contribute good practices and 

standards that we have institutionalised in 

our yards globally. 

As a responsible ocean citizen, we ensure 

that all our yards comply with the discharge 

requirements. In FY2020, we have not 

incurred any significant fines from non-

compliance with environmental laws and 

regulations, nor caused any significant spills.

“ – “ Figures for Indonesia and Brazil were not available for 2018.

(12) This figure has been restated due to recalculation of 

raw data for one of the yards.

*Recycled water (NEWater) is used only in Singapore.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND WELL-BEING

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the global economy as well as businesses worldwide. We have 

put in place various measures to continuously engage our employees and ensure their well-being 

during this period and in the new normal. 

To support the nation’s efforts in COVID-19 testing, we have set up in-house swab centres at two 

of our Singapore yards in 2020 that serve close to 35,000 employees. During the same period, we 

refined our Flexible Benefits System to ensure that our employees are sufficiently protected with core 

health and life insurance.

As part of our foreign workers’ welfare and inclusion programme, we organised various initiatives to 

support the health and well-being of our employees who stay in the dormitories during the circuit-

breaker period. These include:

Appointing dormitory room leaders to support 

the early detection of residents in distress and 

ensure adherence to safe-distancing measures.

Participating in a green project involving 

the study of the effects of installing UV-C 

lights and ioniser plants at common toilets 

to reduce pollutants and airborne virus 

transmission.

Organising virtual engagment activities such 

as drawing competitions, art &amp; craft sessions 

and photo competitions.

Promoting awareness of COVID-19 prevention among 

dormitory residents through drawing competitions 

Initiating a mobile clinic for the welfare of our 

workers residing in our in-house dormitories.

Distributing of care packs filled with essential 

items like hand sanitisers, masks, gloves,  

dry food and Vitamin C. 

Providing support to employees for their

DEEPEN WSH OWNERSHIP

Good WSH performance requires strong 

ownership from all stakeholders, a holistic 

system with clear policies and procedures for 

implementing and building safety competencies; 

and a culture of prevention, trust and care. 

WSH Ownership and Accountability

Sembcorp Marine’s WSH framework is 

championed by the Sembcorp Marine Board and 

Management, employees, contractors and other 

stakeholders. While the Board Risk and Enterprise 

Risk Committees steer the HSE policies, 

framework, procedures and control processes, 

the Group HSE Committee, together with various 

sub-committees at the yards, is responsible for 

developing and deploying the strategies and  

work plans.

In 2020, yard-level HSE committees 

comprised over 600 management and worker 

representatives. They collectively represent more 

than 33,000 Sembcorp Marine employees and 

contractors. These committees are responsible 

for engaging the workforce in HSE programmes.

Our clearly communicated safety policy, 

safety leadership capabilities, and robust safety 

management system, allow us to engage our 

workforce and provide them with knowledge 

on the hazards of their jobs and how to perform 

their work safely. Our communication channels 

include daily toolbox meetings, Vessel Safety 

Coordination Committee meetings, monthly 

WSH Committee meetings and monthly WSH 

Sub-committee meetings held both physically 

and virtually.

Cultivate Positive WSH Culture

Our HSE Life Saving Rules is an important WSH 

culture-building programme that helps prevent 

injuries from high-risk activities at the workplace. 

In 2020, we continued to implement our HSE Life 

Saving Rules, ensuring that all direct employees, 

contractors, visitors and client representatives 

identify critical controls that must be in place.

At our Aracruz yard in Brazil, a campaign “Rules 

that Save Lives” was launched, with the main 

objective of preventing fatalities and serious 

accidents through implementation of the seven 

rules of the CARE programme. Each employee 

was presented with a badge that reaffirms  

their right to refuse to work if the conditions  

are unsafe.

Weekly management inspections are also 

conducted with our client and managers to 

identify and monitor the safety condition of the 

workplaces. This collaborative approach drives a 

positive safety culture among all our stakeholders 

that each play an important role in achieving a 

safety-conscious environment.



Representatives of Sembcorp Marine participated in a WSH awareness event, jointly organised by ASMI and WSHC, to share 

our Total Workplace Safety &amp; Health (Total WSH) approach with participants from various companies and industries.

Continuous Enhancement in HSE Competencies 

and Capabilities

Our yard in Brazil attained the ISO 45001 

certification in 2020. With all our yards in Singapore, 

Indonesia, and Brazil certified to ISO 45001, the 

implementation of our occupational health and 

safety management systems and the monitoring 

of our safety performance can be done more 

effectively and efficiently.

We also conducted Customer Leadership 

Training to highlight the importance of leadership 

in influencing safety behaviour within the 

organisation, and how human and organisational 

factors affect safety norms and values. In 2020,  

we invested 39.9% of total training hours on HSE.

Strong Performance at WSH Awards 2020

Sembcorp Marine clinched 18 awards at the national WSH Awards 2020. 

Organised by Singapore’s WSHC and Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the 

Awards recognise the safety achievements of organisations. 

Of the 18 awards, we received two Workplace Safety and Health Performance 

(Silver) Awards (for our Admiralty Yard and Pandan Yard) and 13 Safety and 

Health Award Recognition for Projects awards for our exemplary safety and 

health standards, and systems.

FOCUS ON WORKPLACE HEALTH

We work to prevent occupational diseases and 

advocate the importance of good industrial 

hygiene practices at the workplace to reduce 

the incidence of ill health.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic 

outbreak in 2020, we swiftly implemented 

procedures and programmes to ensure safe 

resumption of work activities while taking 

care of the health and wellness of all our 

stakeholders at the same time.

Emergency Contingency Plan

We have a comprehensive set of procedures

We developed our Pandemic Prevention 

Policy and implemented Safe Management 

Measures with a strong emphasis on personal 

and workplace hygiene. In 2020, we also 

conducted 98 emergency response drills  

and exercises together with local  

government agencies. 

Workplace Health &amp; Wellness Programme

To support the health and wellness of our 

employees and workers, we implemented a 

series of virtual activities last year. 

We organised the “Mr. Fittest at Alaunia” 

Challenge (Admiralty Yard Dormitory) 

Competition which took place for three weeks 

in May 2020 to encourage our dormitory 

residents to remain motivated and fit during  

the circuit-breaker period, as well as to enliven 

their spirits during such difficult times.

In 2020, our annual HSE carnival was 

moved online to comply with COVID-19 

safety measures. Various activities including 

health talks and wellness programmes were 

conducted during the two-day event. The 

health talk on mental wellness was organised 

to provide employees with tips on how to cope 

with stress and to develop mental resilience.

WSH ADVANCEMENT WITH TECHNOLOGY

In 2020, we continued to innovate, embrace and adopt technology in our operations to provide a 

safer working environment for our employees and contractors.

Enhanced Inspection Capability

We deployed drones with thermal imagery 

camera during inspections to increase safety 

and operational efficiency. These drones allow 

our certified in-house drone pilots to conduct 

inspections in low light or dark conditions and 

identify hot spots (as shown above) in various 

locations from a safe distance and height in order 

to deploy our resources effectively and provide a 

faster response.

Auto Edge Grinding Machine

There is normally extensive grinding of steel edges 

performed after completion of block assembly, 

and scaffolds are typically used as access to work 

at height. The Edge Preparation System (EPS) 

combines Computer Numerical Control (CNC) 

technology with a force-controlled milling system 

which allows such grinding to be done safely and 

accurately at the earliest stage possible, after plate 

cutting but before fitting work commences. This 

machine eliminates the need for deployment of 

personnel to perform grinding activities while 

working at height.

Enabling Remote Surveys

We have successfully trialed remote surveys for 

inspection of vessels under construction. Using 

Nokia’s cloud-based collaboration platform 

and FastMile 4G Customer Premises Equipment 

(CPE), this technology increased operational 

efficiencies by providing connectivity between 

all stakeholders involved, while minimising 

inspectors’ and workers’ exposure to on-site 

safety risks, especially during the COVID-19 

pandemic.

Bluepass Token

We participated in the issuance of Bluepass 

tokens to our workforce in mid-2020. The 

token, a small and battery-powered wearable 

device, assists in contact-tracing by serving 

as a substitute for the TraceTogether app 

at operational areas where the usage of 

smartphones are restricted.

LOCAL COMMUNITIES

Our Aracruz yard in Brazil constructed

RISK MANAGEMENT

Sembcorp Marine considers 

a wide range of risks and 

opportunities in its efforts to 

create value over the long 

term. We focus on a set of 

economic, environmental, 

social and governance 

topics that speak to our 

stakeholders’ interests and 

help us create and preserve 

value in our business. In 

particular, environmental 

issues and climate-related 

risks have been identified 

in Sembcorp Marine’s 

enterprise risk management 

matrix.

In the World Economic 

Forum (WEF) Global Risk 

Report 2020, extreme 

weather events and climate 

action failures are the top 

two global risks in terms 

of likelihood and impact. 

We are paying greater 

attention to these risks, and 

addressing them through our 

sustainability targets. Our risk 

management framework is 

structured to progressively 

meet our mid- and long-

term targets, and ultimately 

reduce the negative impact 

of our operations and 

activities on society and  

the environment.

To address growing 

stakeholder interests 

and concerns around 

climate change, Sembcorp 

Marine identifies, 

assesses and manages 

climate-related risks and 

opportunities following 

the recommendations 

from the Task Force on 

Climate-related Financial 

Disclosures (TCFD). Please 

refer to pages 34 to 35 

in the “Environmental 

Sustainability” section for 

more information on how 

Sembcorp Marine addresses 

the key TCFD elements of 

Governance, Strategy, Risk 

Management, and Metrics 

and Targets.

Risk Champions, appointed 

from various units, help the 

Enterprise Risk Management 

Committee (ERMC) drive key 

risk initiatives and review risk 

issues across the Group. The 

ERMC, also chaired by the 

President &amp; CEO, reports to
