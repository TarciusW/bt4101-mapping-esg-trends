MESSAGE FROM THE BOARD

We are pleased to present Advancer Global 

Limited’s (“AGL” or the “Group”) Sustainability 

Report for our financial year from 1 January 2019 

to 31 December 2019 (“FY2019”). 2019 marks the 

third year of AGL’s sustainability journey and in our 

third Sustainability Report, we have outlined our 

initiatives and achievements on Environmental, 

Social and Governance (“ESG”) factors that have 

been carefully selected to be material factors with 

input from the Group’s key stakeholders.

FY2019 has been a year of progress as the 

Group focuses on automation to transform and 

digitise our businesses, positioning ourselves to 

reap productivity gains and aligning our services 

to a future-ready Singapore. We have moved 

to investing in technology and progressing into 

developing our own e-platforms, dashboard and 

mobile applications which enhances accessibility 

for customers to engage our services through 

a single panel. This move aligns us with 

the Singapore Government’s push to adopt 

technology, automate operational work processes 

and to implement innovative solutions to address 

challenges in a shrinking workforce and ageing 

population.

In FY2019, there was a growth in AGL’s  

performance across all of the Group’s business 

segments. There was a 5.4% increase in the  

Group’s total revenue from S$67.3 million for 

the year ended 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”) 

to S$70.9 million for FY2019. The increase was 

attributed to more Foreign Domestic Workers 

(“FDWs”) being deployed to households by 

the Employment Services Business, additional 

revenue contribution from a newly acquired 

subsidiary as well as service income from the 

Building Management Business and new projects 

secured by the Security Services Business.

AGL will continue to focus on sustainable growth 

through our strategies, policies and procedures 

in creating value for our stakeholders. It is also 

the people behind the scenes and the customers 

we serve that make up the backbone of our 

business. We are firm in our vision of creating 

value and shaping the future by conducting 

business operations in a manner that considers 

the environmental and social impact to sustain 

profitable growth.

Sustainability is at its essence a balancing 

act that requires ongoing engagement of 

our stakeholders. This Sustainability Report 

is an important facet of this engagement.  

We appreciate your continued support and 

will continue to work towards the frontiers of 

sustainable growth, and we hope that you can 

join us on this journey.

GOVERNANCE &amp; SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH 

Continual Commitment to Enhance Corporate Governance

At AGL, we believe that enhancing corporate governance is one of the most important and ongoing 

targets for its business. We are committed to maintaining a high standard of corporate governance by 

adhering to the principles and guidelines set out in the Code of Corporate Governance 2018. We continue 

to maintain a high standard of corporate governance and having an effective corporate practice to 

safeguard against fraud with the aim of protecting shareholders’ interests, maximising long-term success 

of the Group as well as maintaining business transparency. We have established policies for issues such 

as Conflict of Interest, Insider Trading, Fraud and Whistleblowing. In FY2019, there were no incidents of 

corruption and no significant non-compliance with all relevant environmental, social and governance laws 

and regulations. 



Insider Trading Policy 

Conflict of Interest 

Policy 

Our Group has adopted a 

conflict of interest policy to 

guide our employees in the 

identification and management 

of conflicts of interests. All 

of our key management 

staff including our Executive 

Directors and key executive 

officers are to complete the 

annual conflict of interest 

disclosures to our Board. 

Our Group has adopted 

an insider trading policy to

integrity of our Group and 

affiliates. In accordance with 

the policy, any person who 

possesses material, non-

public information relating to 

our Company, or any other 

publicly-traded company, 

including our customers and 

suppliers, obtained in the 

course of employment or by 

association with our Group, is 

considered an insider to such 

information. 

 

Our Group continues to 

educate our employees on 

the Group’s whistle-blowing 

policy to ensure employees 

understand the importance of 

highlighting any inappropriate 

behavior to maintain 

integrity and honesty for our 

stakeholders. We also keep 

all information confidential 

to protect the interest of our 

employees.

GOVERNANCE &amp; SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH 

Sustainability Approach 

An important starting point in our sustainability journey is to identify our stakeholders and material factors 

relevant to our business. The interests and requirements of key stakeholders are also taken into account 

when formulating corporate strategies. These key stakeholders include, amongst others, shareholders, 

employees, customers, suppliers and the regulatory authorities.  

Our Group’s senior management performs a periodic assessment of key focus areas which have the 

greatest economic, environmental and social impact, as well as areas that are most important to our 

stakeholders. Senior management is responsible for the ongoing communication to the Board of Directors. 

Our Group also actively interact with our stakeholders and Directors to develop new and creative ways 

to upgrade our business, by enhancing employees’ skillset. We evaluate the needs and expectations of 

our key stakeholder groups which are significant to our Group’s value creation strategy and strive to build 

mutually beneficial relationships.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

Financial Highlights 

Revenue (By Business Segments)

We are proud to announce that the Group registered a 5.4% growth in revenue from S$67.3 million in 

FY2018 to S$70.9 million in FY2019 due to the increase in revenue across all of the Group’s business 

segments. The increase was attributed by (i) increase in the number of FDWs that the Group had placed 

out to households, (ii) new security projects, (iii) additional revenue contribution from a newly acquired 

subsidiary, and (iv) increase in service income received from new and ad-hoc stewarding service 

contracts, smart toilet systems sold, cleaning services rendered to shopping malls and integrated facilities 

management contracts. 

For FY2019, the Group’s customer retention rates for its Building Management Business and Security 

Services Business were 92.0% and 80.1% respectively (FY2018: 87.9% and 85.8% respectively).  

As at 31 December 2019, the Group has service contracts from its Building Management and Security 

Services Businesses (with varying contract periods) amounting to approximately S$3.7 million monthly 

(31 December 2018: S$3.7 million monthly).

Benefits for Full Time Employees 

The Group provides the following benefits to full-time employees: 

•	

Healthcare subsidies 

•	

Tie-ups with Insurance 

•	

Option of stock ownerships under Employee Share Option Scheme 

•	

Disability Coverage (WICI) 

•	

Parental leave 

We will continue to review our employment policies and strive towards greater gender equality and a more 

inclusive workforce. 

In FY2019, the Group has made higher emphasis on hiring local to reduce reliance on Foreign Manpower 

as well as increase quality training expenditure with reduced cost due to government subsidies, so that 

the organisation can cope with a local aging workforce. 

The target set for FY2019 to achieve a lower employee average monthly turnover rate was not met due to 

the higher turnover rate recorded in the Facilities Management Services division. 

Our aim for FY2020 is to maintain the employee average monthly turnover rate by improving employee 

engagement and retaining of high-potential employees.

TRAINING AND EDUCATION 

At AGL, we believe in ensuring our employees are adequately trained and continuously kept abreast of 

any updates in standards throughout the various industries.  

All new employees are given on-the-job training under the supervision of experienced employees. We 

monitor the training needs and progress of our employees on a regular basis so that they can plan their 

professional development accordingly.  

With the rapid technological and market changes in our 

industry, it is vital for our employees to keep themselves 

abreast of the latest industry developments and be future-

ready. The yearly average training hours per employee 

in FY2019 stands at 35 hours (FY2018: 28 hours) for our 

Operations staff and 18 hours (FY2018: 12 hours) at the

WSQ Comply With Workplace Safety And Health Policies And

In FY2019, all employees received their performance review in line with the Group’s policies. We encourage 

on-going and two-way communication between employees and their supervisor(s). This exercise allows the 

managers and employees to set expectations and address potential gaps in their performance. Regular and 

ad-hoc feedback are also given to employees. The practices in place to develop and improve employees’ 

performance have contributed to improve organisational performance. Furthermore, these practices allow 

the Group to monitor the skillsets of employees and to develop human capital within the organisation.

We had also achieved our target set for FY2019, by maintaining the Group target of an average of 20 

training hours per headcount. 

For FY2020, our aim is to continue to maintain yearly average training hours per operation staff and 

management staff at 35 hours and 18 hours respectively which are relevant to their core duties.

LOCAL COMMUNITIES 

While pursuing growth and development, we believe 

in giving back to the community is a responsibility 

of a corporate citizen in the business that we are 

involving. Where possible, the Group strive to 

engage in activities that promote positive impact. 

During the financial year, the Group have also 

made donations to several events/organisations 

e.g. Bukit Timah Cares Charity National Day 

Dinner 2019 and others. The Group partnered 

with NGOs (Non-Government Organisations) such 

as the Centre for Domestic Employees, Foreign 

Domestic Workers Association for Social Support 

and Training and Humanitarian Organisation for 

Migration Economics and support their initiatives 

to build a better environment for Foreign Domestic 

Workers. In FY2019, our FDWs went to Wild Wild 

Wet during the May Day Domestic Employees 

Celebration 2019, and also went to a workshop on 

fostering harmonious employment relationships 

through art and empathy.

For FY2020, the Group’s target is to continue to 

have initiatives to build a better environment for 

FDWs and participate or contribute to more social 

events.

CUSTOMER PRIVACY 

Our materiality assessment has indicated that 

customer data privacy and protection is of 

paramount importance to our stakeholders, 

making this one of the material topics for AGL. 

We understand that with the advancement of 

technology, there is a growing trend of concerns 

for individuals on how their personal data are 

being collected, managed and used. 

Personal Data Protection Act 

Ensuring safety and privacy of our customers’ data 

is of great priority to us. We have processes and 

controls in place for handling and communicating 

sensitive and confidential information of our 

customers. Our information security policies ensure 

our customers’ data are managed in accordance 

to the level of confidentiality. We strictly observe 

all local laws and internal regulations applicable to 

personal information protection. 

Customers’ data are stored in secure databases 

where we have established safeguards in place 

against impending IT security threats for instance, 

periodic change of passwords, installation of anti-

virus and firewalls. These policies and procedures 

are disseminated to all employees and our operating 

entities in the Group. Every operational manager is 

expected to establish and implement the Group’s 

PDPA policy and monitor for compliance. 

In FY2019, there were no substantiated complaints 

concerning any breaches or loss of customer data. 

Customers’ privacy is of utmost importance to our 

Group and we consistently monitor and update our 

PDPA policy in accordance with new requirements 

and business developments. For FY2020 and 

beyond, we target to achieve zero complaints and 

PDPA breaches.
