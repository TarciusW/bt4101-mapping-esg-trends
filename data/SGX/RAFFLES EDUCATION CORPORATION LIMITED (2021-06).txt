MANAGING SUSTAINABILITY 

 

At Raffles Education, sustainability is managed at all levels. We are committed to incorporate environmental, social 

and governance (ESG) considerations in the formulation and setting of our business strategies and operations. For us, 

sustainability is not an option, it is a key to our corporate values. 

 

The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated the need to integrate ESG practices for the Group and its stakeholders. It has 

specifically raised the significance of social factors in the current moment, and environmental factors in the long 

term. 

 

We, at every level in the organization play a part in creating a responsible and sustainable business. We strive to 

contribute and foster the sustainable development of the Group, our industry and the society that we live in. We use 

our resources efficiently and with our transparent processes and collaborative business approach, we work to generate 

value and continuously improve the entire value chain.

SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH 

 

STAKEHOLDERS ENGAGEMENT 

 

Stakeholders’ engagement is important in developing this sustainability strategy as we seek to have positive outcomes 

for our business, society and the environment. We have engaged with key internal and external stakeholders through 

detailed and in-depth conversations covering a range of material issues, including the focus on our current strategy, 

processes as well as risks and opportunities. Through these engagements, we gained even greater clarity on how to 

continue providing sustainability-focused products and services that put our communities at the centre of our decision-

making process.

Building a Sense of Community 

 

We have organized a range of social events to encourage students to socialise and strengthen their sense of 

community. Volunteering and community engagements are part of our strong focus.  

 

Promoting Mental Health 

 

We know that a student life can sometimes be a stressful experience for students, especially so during the 

lockdowns, which have isolated students from interactions with classmates, and their teachers. Prolonged isolation 

can cause health issues, including mental health problems. Mental health is increasingly recognised as an important 

area that demands higher attention but too often overlooked. This situation might affect students’ wellbeing and 

disrupt their education. We have therefore, provided additional support to students as well as our employees to 

enable them to deal with the further challenges in their lives caused by Covid-19 and to keep them on track with 

studies or career paths. 

 

Active and Healthy Lifestyle 

 

We also promote physical health on campus. We encourage students to lead a more active lifestyle, through 

participation in sports, events and competitions and community engagement. 

 

For example, the following are the programmes conducted by our Raffles Singapore throughout the year:

We will increase opportunities to engage with our stakeholders in the coming years to listen to their material concerns, 

understand how we can support them, and  accordingly integrate support systems to mitigate and resolve these 

material concerns, and in doing so, align their best interests and the interests of the Group. The evaluation of the 

stakeholders’ input and contribution will help shape the materiality analysis and provide important insights into 

the direction of the Group’s commitment to integrate social and environmental issues into every aspect of our 

business.

1. ENVIRONMENT 

 

The Group is committed to minimise and manage the environmental footprint of our operations and resources usage, 

especially in the midst of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. In designing strategies to reduce our environmental impact, 

we include the feedback from our key stakeholders who can provide us ground-level information, demands and 

peculiarities that help us to focus on scalable, Group-wide initiatives. Through this approach, we measure the 

environmental impact of our activities, that can also improve  our performance in various cost saving initiatives. 

 

In response to local Covid-19 situations, the company also implements working from home (WFH) for our employees, 

and delivers home-based learning (HBL) for our students across Raffles’ network of colleges to ensure the safety and 

well-being of all staff and students where appropriate. Flexible work arrangement and staggered working hours are 

also implemented at colleges where employees and students are allowed to resume work and study on campus. 

 

The following discussion outlines our environmental activities and performance during the financial year 2021. These 

serve as an opportunity to review our environmental performance and set targets for improvement in the future. 

Through this standard, we work to establish company-wide guidelines and to systematically assess our performance 

in reducing our energy consumption, paired with efficient waste and resources management.  

 

(a) ENERGY CONSUMPTION 

 

(i) Electricity  

 

The Group relies on energy resources, primarily electricity consumption for powering our schools/colleges operation. 

We are committed to reducing our dependence on consumption of electricity where possible. We measure our 

electricity consumption on a group-wide scale, generating an average of electricity consumption for our main 

school/colleges as well as in our branch offices. 

 

Our Group Information Technology Department (“Group IT”) has reduced the use of rented server space from two to 

zero through consolidation of services running on various server hardware in the Data Centres. Group IT now maintain 

on-premises servers, with minimum needed server hardware. This has effectively led to reduced energy consumption 

and lower CO2 emissions. 

 

For the past few years, we have managed to reduce our physical server footprints significantly, which delivered cost 

savings, and reduced purchase of equipment, electricity usage, and operational overheads, and the consequent carbon 

footprint that these equipment require.  All of our employees and students are now using Office 365 platform that 

allow a 1TB data storage, which reduces our costs substantially. Students may access events, resources and 

programmes from other campuses under the homogenous platform, expanding their opportunities for learning and 

development. 

 

As of now, Group IT has decommissioned 70% of server hardware leading to reduction in cost, manpower and energy 

consumption.  

 

In 2021, we managed to achieve approximately 29% saving from the total electricity consumption based on the data 

collected from our main campuses and branch offices as a result of the temporary work from home and online learning 

due to the ongoing Covid-19 situation.  

 

 

(ii) Water 

 

Our schools/colleges use large quantities of water daily. We have undertaken the initiative to measure water footprints 

across our portfolio in developing the strategies for more sustainable water usage. We have so far, managed to achieve 

the minimization of water consumption by raising the awareness of our students and employees. 

 

We have achieved an approximately 38% reduction in water consumption over the financial year 2021. To reduce this 

further, we must understand how water is currently managed across our business and where the remaining 

inefficiencies lie. 

RAFFLES EDUCATION CORPORATION SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2021          15 


 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) Indoor Air Quality 

 

The Group takes concern on healthy indoor environment for the employees and students. Indoor air quality is an 

important part of maintaining healthy indoor environment. We maintain indoor air quality by regularly maintaining 

the air conditioning system, cleaning of the filtration system and performing scheduled flushing to bring in fresh air 

into the indoor environement. We  monitor indoor air quality regularly so as to provide our employees and students 

with a clean and comfortable environment.  

 

16 

RAFFLES EDUCATION CORPORATION SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2021 


(b) WASTE AND RESOURCES

(i) Responsible Waste Management

At RafflesEducation, we are aware that effective waste management is critical for the conservation of limited natural 

resources. All our waste is disposed of responsibly, with effective systems for collection, recycling and disposal. We 

have been encouraging our students and employees to observe green practices as part of our effort in reducing 

environmental footprint.  

We view reducing and recycling waste as an important issue and are working to reduce unnecessary waste from food 

production in our schools by improving the efficacy of types and amount of meals prepared. For example, the Group 

has reduced almost 50 kg of food waste in 2021 mainly in our Raffles American School in Johor, a decrease of 32% 

food waste from the previous year. We also practiced composting through our engagement with local integrated waste 

management vendor to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that brings adverse effect to climate change. 

(ii) Resource Management

All information and documents including teaching materials have been digitally distributed and shared with most 

information being stored in cloud-based data storage and management. Materials are accessible anywhere on 

demand, and users do not require connectivity to the campus physical server or need to obtain hard drives or 

computers. This reduces transportation requirements (and their related emissions) to and from campus, saving 

time, and improving convenience for our stakeholders. 

(iii) Reducing Paper Consumption

As paper is one of the largest material resources consumed in our daily operations, we have proactively transitioned 

towards a paperless policy through the digitalisation of our internal processes across all our operations. 

Our lectures are delivered through our online Learning Management System and through collaborations with 

Microsoft Teams, Sharepoint and Moodle by uploading teaching materials and final assessment as well as vetting 

and moderation of the same. All applications for admission to our schools are only accepted online. If printing of 

papers is required, eco ink, eco print and double-sided printing are adopted. 

We have incorporated a workflow system that handles processes from the approvals to payment processing online. 

To do so, we deployed an e-Purchasing system in the Group to replace hardcopy purchase approval forms which have 

led to reduction of paper waste.   

Digital documents have now replaced conventional documents such as physical degree scrolls and transcripts, 

qualification statements and professional development certificates. Through the use of blockchain technology, we 

expect to achieve an estimated 77% nett savings per student on related printing and paper costs. 

We have been implementing the PLUTO student management system in our universities where student records are 

scanned and stored digitally in the system. This system would essentially cut down our reliance on and utilization of 

physical files and storage spaces across our campuses. 

We have also discontinued the practice of mailing printed hard copies of the Company’s Annual Reports and 

circulars, to our shareholders effective financial year ended 30 June 2020 to be in line with our environmental-

friendly efforts. The annual reports and any circulars will, instead, be available for download at the Company’s 

corporate website at https://raffles.education as well as on SGXNET website. 

RAFFLES EDUCATION CORPORATION SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2021        17 


 

 

 

 

 

In FY2021, we have managed to reduce approximately 31.4% of paper consumption from the previous year, due to 

the increase of working from home in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. We are working on our target to reduce 

paper consumption by 50% within a year as part of our commitment to reduce environmental footprint. We have been 

actively raising awareness among our employees to only print paper copies when necessary and to always print double 

sided. We also encourage the re-use of one-sided printed paper and re-used envelopes for internal mails. As we 

integrate our environmental efforts into our business operations, we encourage our shareholders to support our 

sustainability efforts towards building a clean and green environment and at the same time help to improve efficacy 

in delivering cost reductions for the Group. 

 

We also target to establish an environmental framework that consist of environment impact assessment and 

commitments within the Group. 

 

(c) SUSTAINABILITY AWARENESS 

 

Raising the level of understanding and awareness on ESG sustainability among our students and employees is 

indispensable. As such, we advocate sustainability in most of the subjects taught in our schools/colleges.  

 

Raffles International College in Bangkok, Thailand for example, has Environmental Sustainability as a core subject 

mandated by the Ministry of Education in Thailand, and similarly the same topic has been taught to children in Grade 

1 to 9 of our Raffles American School, Bangkok, Thailand. 

 

Most of our students have been instilled with this awareness which is applied in their industry and community projects, 

putting design knowledge and skills to provide more efficient solutions, quality products and promote a better way of 

life as a whole. 

 

Further sustainability related programmes are described under stakeholders' engagement on page 9 -12 of this Report.

SOCIAL

(a) EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES

(i) Human Capital Development and Relation

Human capital development is extremely important for continuous corporate growth. It is constantly being assessed 

and redefined to suit the times and the needs of the Group.  

The Covid-19 crisis has brought a renewed focus on human capital and employees in a few aspects. As our business is 

extremely people-centric, the ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain talent is critical to our sustainability. Our 

Group Human Resource’s strategies to better manage our employees can be seen through our implementation of 

shifting to work remotely and also virtual collaboration in areas of communication, productivity, feedback, talent 

acquisition and others. The Covid-19 pandemic has upended the way our employees experience work. We ensure that 

all our employees have equal access to technology to work remotely. For those who do not have, we help to provide 

alternatives for them to work and participate. 

The following is the human capital tabulation for this reporting year of our hired employees as at 30 June 2021.

ethnic or religious belief, age, cultural and social background, language, physical ability, lifestyle or other personal 

choice. Fostering a culture of diversity has played a key role in RafflesEducation’s sustained success of our workforce, 

and contributes to a variety of perspectives that are key to a team-based approach of working. These principles are 

laid down in the Group’s mandatory minimum employment standards, which apply group-wide across all locations. 

In this reporting period, RafflesEducation was not notified of any discriminatory behaviour. Should violations become 

known, these would be sanctioned according to the legal instruments available locally. 

The international nature of the Group is evident not only in the workforce but also on the management level. Wherever 

possible, local management positions are held by local executives. Furthermore, the Group seeks to fill an increasing 

number of Group management positions with international candidates. It also encourages international collaboration 

through RafflesEducation expat programme, which supports employees in gaining experience in another country 

where the Group operates.

(iii) Fair Employment Practices

Employees are our assets. We undertake fair employment practices and create an inclusive workplace culture and 

provide equal employment opportunities to achieve a congenial  working environment, regardless of age        

and gender. Our Group’s human resource planning ensures only suitable candidates are hired for the jobs through our 

fair recruitments and selection process. The Group embraces diversity and we recognize the importance of creating a 

inclusive environment where employees can treat each other respectfully, honestly and equally. 

The Group conducts annual performance appraisals for all employees to validate their merit performance to complete 

job tasks. Objective evaluations aid in the recognition of employees’ competency and gaps, potentially allowing 

adjustments to the training programmes. 

Continuous education and trainings complement performance evaluations by establishing an active communication 

channel between employer and employees. Employee gatherings strengthen bonds and build a strong working 

relationship between employees for an efficient workplace synergy.

(v) Positive Work Environment

RafflesEducation recognizes that a positive work environment is essential to attract, motivate and retain talents. 

A total well-being programme has been put in place to promote personal development, conducive working 

environment, health, open communication and positive reinforcement. Initiatives include a comprehensive medical 

benefits plan, flexible work arrangement, employee engagement initiatives, performance bonus, annual appraisal etc. 

Under the leadership of the Group’s Chairman and CEO, Mr. Chew Hua Seng, the Group will continue to build on its 

strong foundation and strive to continue to be a premier education provider. 

(vi) Zero Tolerance on Harassment

We have zero tolerance for direct or indirect discrimination, victimisation, intimidation, bullying or harassment in the 

workplace.  

Any non-compliance incidents can be reported to Group HR and can be subjected to disciplinary action. Our standards 

for labour standards are communicated to all employees.  Our talent policies and initiatives are aimed at strengthening 

our team as well as creating an equitable, and safe workplace where our team can thrive and work together.

RafflesEducation is committed to and strongly supports a policy that allows employees to work in an environment 

free from any unwelcomed harassment or abuse by fellow employees or others. 

We view sexual harassment as a serious misconduct that undermines the integrity and respect of the working 

relationship of employees in the workplace. Sexual harassment is also regarded as a serious violation of the Company’s 

Rules and Code of Conduct and the Company will not hesitate to report such violations or misconduct to the police. 

(vii) Commitment Towards a Safe and Healthy Workplace

Occupational health and safety (“OHS”) are of utmost importance to RafflesEducation. We are committed to having 

a safe and healthy learning environment and workplace for all and are in the midst of drawing up a framework towards 

OHS that will include identifying material issues, setting of policies, and ensuring accountability within the Company.

(b) TRAINING AND STAFF DEVELOPMENT

In view of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the upskilling of our employees is carried out through online platforms to 

meet strategic targets in the changing working environment. We believe acquisition of higher skills and knowledge

Our students expect quality education and good experiences, so we at RafflesEducation focus on understanding our 

students and putting them first in everything we do. 

We strive to understand what they are seeking and continuously improve the quality of our courses to meet their 

needs and expectations. We use a combination on internal and external measurements to assess how we are 

doing and to improve the quality of our products and services. 

We have conducted our Student Satisfaction Surveys in 2020 and 2021 for services rendered that cover the area of 

facilities and environment, teaching-learning resources, student support services, student grievances, general 

satisfaction and overall satisfaction rates.

3) 

GOVERNANCE 

 

(a) CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

 

Corporate Governance serves as the backbone of our business. We believe that having strong corporate governance, 

incorporating ESG considerations, is key to creating a sustainable future. At RafflesEducation, the Board plays a key 

role in setting governing standards. Our corporate governance framework is anchored on competent leadership, effective 

internal controls, a strong risk culture, and accountability to stakeholders. In addition, the Board reviews and approves 

the Group's risk management, internal control framework and sustainability plans and is well informed of the Group's 

activity and work together with the management in mapping the right direction and defining risk tolerance limit and 

realistic goals for the Group. 

 

Our Corporate Governance statement is set out in our Annual Report 2021 from pages 45 – 65. 

 

(i) Ethics and Transparency 

 

We always conduct our business in a fair and ethical manner, considering the interests of all our stakeholders to achieve 

long-term and sustainable growth. It also entails effective risk management, which is more relevant than ever in this age 

of digitalisation as issues related to data protection and cyber security come to the fore. 

 

(ii) Proactive Anti-Corruption Practices 

 

At RafflesEducation, we are committed to carry out our business with integrity through our zero-tolerance approach 

towards any form of corruption and bribery and ensuring our employees comply with the anti- corruption and anti-

bribery laws of all the jurisdictions that we operate in. We have mechanisms entrenched in our anti-bribery and anti-

corruption policy as well as whistle blowing guidelines for employees and the public to raise any concerns via a 

dedicated email account on any form of potential and committed improprieties relating to matters concerning financial 

reporting, internal controls, corruption, bribery and fraud. All employees are provided with copies of the anti-bribery 

and anti-corruption directive  and whistle blowing guidelines, which all employees are required to acknowledge receipt 

and confirm understanding of. 

 

For this reporting period, no offence was reported (FY2021: zero incident). We target to maintain zero record of 

corruption incident for the financial year ending 30 June 2022. 

 

 

(iii) Shareholders Communication 

 

The Group takes note of the importance of shareholders education, communication and protection. Through making 

timely announcements, we communicate our business strategies and update our financial results to the shareholders. This 

enables us to make ongoing benchmarking and evaluation of our business performance to ensure we remain competitive 

in the education business. Our Annual Reports and company websites also help shareholders understand how we conduct 

our business around the globe and increase awareness of the Group within the investors community. 

 

 

(iv) Value Creation for Shareholders 

 

The Group’s operations around the regions form the core of our business offerings for economic value creation. We always 

strive to build sustainable value for our shareholders through capital preservation and appreciation, which allows us to 

further improve our relationship with stakeholders. We also believe in promoting shared value between the Group, our 

colleges/ schools and the community, hence we are putting in place innovative measures to increase our student enrolment 

with e-learning solutions, to boost our services to students which in turn contributes to the Group’s financial performance. 

 

 

RAFFLES EDUCATION CORPORATION SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2021          25 


(b) RISK MANAGEMENT

At RafflesEducation, the Risk Management Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight of risk, 

reviewing the Group’s risk appetite and risk profile in relation to capital and liquidity, in particular, in identifying and 

managing the main categories of risks –Strategy Risk, Operational Risk, Information Technology Risk, Financial Risk 

and Regulatory Compliance. 

Further details on our Risk Management and Internal Controls approach can be found in our Annual Report  2021 on pages 

57 – 59. 

(i) Personal Data Protection (“PDP”)

The Group prioritizes employees and stakeholders’ personal data and ensure that their personal data are kept safe and 

secure. Our data privacy strategy as set out in our PDP Policy incorporates strong governance on strengthening privacy 

controls to drive a responsible business culture, supported by continuous awareness on safe privacy practices and 

information management.  

We are devoted to integrate data security and privacy at all levels, particularly in our online classrooms. Our top priority 

is to protect our students and users’ information. With this in mind, we ensure that our students and users’ personal data 

are not susceptible to any unauthorized use. 

The Group is currently in the process to attain Data Protection Trustmark Certification (“DPTM”). The DPTM 

Certification Framework was developed by adopting and aligning with Singapore’s enhanced PDPA and incorporating 

elements of international benchmarks and best practices. 

(ii) Cyber Security Threat

The Group recognises that cyber threat is one of the key concerns in today’s business dealings. The ongoing digitalisation 

has exposed IT related threats to the Group’s businesses that might result in compromising confidentiality, integrity and 

availability of the Group’s information assets and system, such as data confidentiality breaches, host exploitation, 

network security vulnerability, intentional data alteration, data loss or theft, phishing and hacking, domain-based 

threat and unauthorized access due to lack of internal control, etc. 

We take these threats seriously and we have been consolidating all of our IT policies and procedures to manage these 

risks to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Group’s information assets are protected at all times. 

We have implemented and will continue to enhance our recovery strategy, backup and restoration procedures, and 

email security to prevent any form of IT threats. 

We have recently deployed Sophos Enterprise End Point Protection to most users across the Group. We deployed the 

Sophos Intercept X with XDR to top managers and the Intercept X to other users. With this we are able to access and 

manage all our endpoint device security anytime and anywhere. Group IT has access to assess the security condition of 

all devices from their station, address and mitigate such threat, and are able to remotely intitate full scan of such device. 

In summary, there were no red flags of potential cyber security risks identified in the current reporting period. With 

current solutions in Office 365, it has greatly prevented the severity of end-user security attacks. To further secure access 

to users’ Office 365 platform, we have initiated and rolled out Multifactor Authentication on all user emails. This provides 

a second layer of security which is different than the usual password needed to access emails. Stronger password policy 

was also adopted. 

We will continue to review the portfolio of our Group’s performance to ensure the correct safeguards are in place to 

manage increasingly sophisticated threats to IT security and ensure that appropriate controls are in place to mitigate 

potential cyber-related risks. We also target to reduce administration effort by transitioning hardware and software to 

Office 365 so our Group IT team can work on higher value activities in the coming years.
