BOARD STATEMENT

EMBRACING THE NEW ENERGY CHANGE

The Board of Directors at Kim Heng Ltd. (“Kim Heng” and together with its subsidiaries, “the Group”) is pleased to present our 

sustainability report of the Group for the financial period ended 31 December 2020 (“FY2020”). 

In FY2020, we successfully expanded our market presence in the renewable energy space. We achieved new revenue amounting 

to approximately S$11.9 million from the Offshore Wind Farm projects in Taiwan, representing 31.3% of the Group’s total revenue 

for FY2020. This provides strong validation for the Group to diversify our business and evolve into a sustainable and clean energy 

solutions provider. Building on the foundations laid in 2019, we established several new entities to capitalise on the offshore wind 

farms and marine construction opportunities in Asia. As a result of the strong forecasted growth in the renewable energy market, the 

Group sought approval for the diversification of its business to include the new renewable energy support business. We endeavour to 

develop our capabilities and our workforce through technology advancements and robust training programmes to ready ourselves 

for the international expansion across new markets in the renewable energy space.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, our business faced disruptions and demand reduced due to project delays across the board. 

Singapore implemented the Circuit Breaker measures from April to June 2020 and our operations halted as a result. We responded 

quickly to the COVID-19 pandemic and implemented business continuity plans to minimise business interruptions. Amidst these 

difficult times, we prioritised the physical health and safety as well as the mental well-being of our staff and workers. We implemented 

safe management measures at the workplace and strictly comply with the COVID-19 guidelines and regulations imposed by the 

local government. We will continue to remain vigilant in the fight against the COVID-19 outbreak and ensure that all employees 

strictly comply with the COVID-19 safety regulations.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to express my sincere thanks to our hardworking team of management and staff, and all our 

shareholders for their continued support. We remain committed to driving long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value.

Our primary goal is to be a one-stop provider of comprehensive range of products and services that caters to different stages of 

marine infrastructure projects and offshore oil &amp; gas projects from oil exploration to field development and oil production.

We aim to do this by delivering the finest integrated solutions accompanied by first class customer service. Our core values 

encapsulate what we stand for in our everyday operations and how we strive to maintain long-term sustainability in our operations. 

OUR CORE VALUES

SAFETY FIRST

INNOVATION

CUSTOMER FOCUS

We take pride in offering our 

customers the highest standard, without 

compromising safety standards and 

operational effectiveness.

We proactively seek to improve the 

performance and efficiency of our 

business so that we will always be one 

step ahead.

Our understanding of your business 

and mastery of the industry enable us to

meet your expectations.

QUALITY ASSURANCE, ZERO ACCIDENT ENVIRONMENT AND CLIENT SATISFACTION

Corporate Responsibility is a key consideration in our daily operations. In our day-to-day operations, and when launching new 

services or working with our partners, the Group takes into consideration the socioeconomic influence and the environmental impact 

that our actions may have on the wider community. It is the Group’s view that a socially responsible business is one that is valued by 

the community and all of its stakeholders.

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE

While the Group considers sustainability to be a part of our business philosophy, it is important to note how sustainability is governed 

and driven throughout the organisation in our daily operations. 

The Board takes overall responsibility in overseeing the Group’s sustainability management. A sustainability committee, comprising of 

senior management including the Chief Financial Officer and the Head of Corporate Services, is responsible for driving the Group’s 

overarching sustainability strategy and channelling the implementation of sustainability initiatives in the day-to-day operations of 

business managers. These managers in their respective functions become responsible for implementation, measuring, monitoring 

and reporting back to the committee on the progress. These managerial functions extend across business units including, Human 

Resources, Operational Safety, Health and Environment, and Procurement.

EMBRACING THE NEW ENERGY CHANGE

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

Materiality is a crucial step for most businesses to ensure that their sustainability strategy is targeted and relevant. We consider our 

materiality to be a critical input into our corporate sustainability strategy, as it ensures that we engage our stakeholders with the 

information that is most relevant and influential to them and our business. 

Our material topics were determined in the materiality assessment that was conducted in FY2017, when we undertook our reporting 

journey. The Group has reviewed and believed that these material topics are still relevant in the current context and have decided 

to continue reporting on these topics as there have been no significant changes to our business strategy and market environment. 

However, this year we have faced the unprecedented impacts from COVID-19 and emphasised our sustainability efforts to address 

this challenge. 

There are 6 material topics that have been strategized across the three pillars of sustainability; environmental, social and economic. 

ENVIRONMENTAL

Resource Management

SOCIAL

Health &amp; Safety

Human Capital

ECONOMIC

Ethics &amp; Anti-Corruption

Regulatory Complaince

Financial Stability

ENVIRONMENTAL 

Environmental considerations are increasing rapidly both at the national and global level. Governments, organisations and 

stakeholders are realising the financial risks and opportunities associated with environmental management. The shipping industry 

can play a role towards a clean energy transition and the Group is committed to be a part of this effort.  

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 

The Group’s operations make use of energy primarily through electricity and marine gas oil. These are fossil fuel heavy sources 

of energy, making it an important area of consideration for our resource management. Another important consideration is water 

management. Ships and vessels make use of ballast water, which can be harmful to the environmental biodiversity of water bodies, 

should it be disposed irresponsibly. The final area of consideration in resource management is waste, which occurs through the 

fabrication of offshore platforms as well as the building and repairing of vessels. All three areas of our resource consumption are 

impactful on the environment and hence require effective management.

The industry in which we operate is subject to several environmental regulations regarding air pollution, ballast water discharge 

and waste. Our sustainability journey has enabled us to reframe these regulations from a ‘compliance exercise’ to an ‘opportunity 

to minimise waste and leakages in our business’. The Group believes in the benefits that sustainability efforts can have on the triple 

bottom line. 

The Group operates with the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System (“EMS”) as well as the ISO 9001:2008 Quality 

Management System (“QMS”). We make use of these systems to apply a precautionary approach towards addressing and managing 

our environmental footprint.

We always strive to operate in strict compliance with all environmental regulations and requirements. In FY2020, we achieved zero 

reported incidents of environmental non-compliance. 


KIM HENG LTD. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

ENVIRONMENTAL 

EMBRACING THE NEW ENERGY CHANGE

Energy and Emissions

Management Approach

The International Maritime Organisation (“IMO”) has established the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (“SEEMP”) as a 

regulation to provide a practical approach in managing ship operations and fleet efficiency performance. This year, we remained 

compliant with the SEEMP and all vessels were issued an approved SEEMP Certificate of Compliance.

In FY2020, we also conducted the annual Recognised Organisation class survey on all vessels and maintained compliance with the 

MARPOL Annex VI regulations1 on air pollution. As a result of our efforts in 2020, all vessels remain accredited with the International 

Energy Efficiency Certificate and International Air Pollution Prevention Certificate. This demonstrates our alignment to MARPOL 

Annex VI regulations and our control of the nitrogen oxide emissions of our vessels.

Under the IMO MARPOL treaty, the IMO 2020 regulation limits sulfur in ships’ fuel to a maximum of 0.50% and came into force 

globally on 1 January 2020. The Group maintains its stance on using fuel that falls within the acceptable range of 0.37% to 

0.5% sulphur levels. Our vessels are Anchor Handling Tug Supply (“AHTS”) vessels that run on marine gas oil (“MGO”), and we 

commonly use 0.5% sulfur MGO and, where available, Low Sulphur Marine Gas Oil (“LSMGO”) that has a sulfur content of less 

than 0.1%.

In FY2020, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the expansion of our offshore wind farm support services were disrupted. Nevertheless, 

we will continue to develop these services to facilitate the production of renewable energy, highlighting our commitment towards 

sustainability and innovation. 

Beyond environmental efforts for our vessels, the Group is aiming to foster and develop a ‘green culture’ within all areas of our 

organisation and have continued the investigation into achieving an Eco-Office Labelling Certificate. 

Performance

In FY2020, there were two shipyards and eight vessels in operation. The Group includes both electricity consumption of our 

shipyards and fuel consumption of our vessels in the energy consumption data collection. We have also included both scope 1 and 

scope 2 carbon emissions based on the consumption values.

ENVIRONMENTAL 

EMBRACING THE NEW ENERGY CHANGE

Water Discharge and Conservation

Management Approach

The Group continues to abide by our established ballast water management (“BWM”) plan, which requires all ships to have: 

i. 

a BWM plan;

ii. 

a ballast water record book; and 

iii. the International Ballast Water Management Certificate. 

In FY2020, all our vessels maintained compliance with either the applicable D1 standard (which specifies requirements for ships to 

exchange ballast water in open seas, away from coastal areas) or D2 standard (which requires ships to conform to the maximum 

amount of viable organisms allowed to be discharged, including specified indicator microbes harmful to human health). In addition, 

our vessels are accredited with the International Ballast Water Management Certificate. Beyond these regulations, all vessels have the 

Shipboard Marine Pollution Emergency Plan (“SMPEP”) implemented onboard and they operate in compliance with the MARPOL 

Annex 1 regulation on prevention of oil pollution. They are accredited with the International Oil Pollution Prevention (“IOPP”) 

certificate.

Our office and shipyard operations continue to make use of rainwater harvesting and reuse. 

This year, all vessels were required to report their monthly water consumption and the management monitored and verified the 

water consumption with a high degree of scrutiny. This allowed us to identify areas of water waste reduction and implement water 

conservation across the Group. 

Performance

In FY2020, we are reporting the water consumption data of the shipyards and 8 out of 11 vessels in operation.

61,219

64,222

The increase in total water consumption was primarily due to the increase in the number of vessels from 5 to 11 (of which 8 were 

operational) in year 2020.

Waste Management

Management Approach

The Group complies with the MARPOL Annex V – Regulations for prevention of pollution by garbage and has strict waste management 

procedures and guidelines that have been developed with reference to local and international standards. We continued to adhere 

to these standards over the year.

Future Outlook and Performance Indicators

• 

We are still in the process of investigation for the installation of solar panels and LED lighting solutions in our operations, as we 

aim to increase the use of cleaner energy. Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, there have been delays in conducting feasibility 

studies for both yards and we endeavour to complete this evaluation by 2021 if the COVID situation improves. 

• 

We aim to reduce our energy, water and waste levels by 2% by the year 2022, from the base year 2017. 

• 

We aim to achieve a Green Office Label certification by 2022 within 5 years of our base year 2017. As there were plans to 

sell the 48 Penjuru yard in year 2019/2020, the Green Office Label certification was halted till 4Q2020. With the current 

COVID-19 situation, we do foresee a delay in the certification.

• 

The Group aims to develop and organise an environmental awareness campaign in the future. 

• 

Maintain compliance with environmental regulations and requirements. 

 

Performance4

In FY2020, we are reporting the waste collection data of the shipyards and eight vessels in operation.

HEALTH AND SAFETY

The Group endeavours to make its shipyards and worksites safe and healthy for all employees and contractors. We recognise that 

due to the nature of some of our operations, the safety of our on-site crew and vessel workers can be at risk, but the Group is 

committed to ensuring that our staff are safe at work. 

Management Approach

The Group adheres to the best-in-class health &amp; safety standards to ensure that the necessary safety measures are implemented across 

the organisation. Our stringent health, safety and environment (“HSE”) policy, outlining the key requirements for all employees, is in 

place and is implemented and monitored by key designated HSE personnel. These designated HSE personnel also monitor any HSE-

related issues for the shipyards as well as the vessels. Their scope of operation also extends to the attainment of relevant certifications 

to ensure that the Group remains compliant. 

Similar to FY2019, our stringent risk mitigation measures are complemented with additional comprehensive risk assessments 

carried out by the HSE Risk Management Team, comprising Head of Shipyard, HSE Manager and HSE Committee members, on 

a regular basis, to ensure all areas of safety are in check. This year, we expanded our HSE Risk Management Team to include Risk 

Management Team Leaders from every department, ensuring more accountability along the reporting streams that are now specific 

to each job function.

The Group recognises that in order to ensure the safety of its workers, it is the responsibility of every employee to follow the correct 

procedures. This ensures a safe working environmental for all. We continue to reiterate that it is each employee’s responsibility to 

stay vigilant against any unsafe act or behaviour, such as incorrect working procedures, unsafe equipment and working conditions.

We have also implemented Safety Observations to inculcate safe work practices among employees. The Safety Observations illustrate 

best practices for controlling workplace hazards and improving occupational health and safety through safe acts and behaviours, 

improved equipment status and improved procedures. We included these Safety Observations in the Standard Operating Procedures 

(“SOP”) to ensure the implementation of these safe practices and procedures. We strive to actively reduce the risks of accidents, 

injuries and illnesses for the health and safety of our employees and to an extent, the local community. 

As a result of our commitment to our employees’ health and safety within our organisation and processes, we achieved the 

ISO45001:2018 certification for Occupational Health and Safety Management System. By conforming with this standard, we are 

able to implement and maintain an Occupational Health and Safety Management System that improves occupational health and 

safety, eliminates hazards, minimises occupational health and safety risks associated with our activities.

Additionally, we have maintained the following certifications: 

• 

BIZSAFE STAR  

• 

ISO14001:2015: Environmental Management System

• 

ISO 22:000 - ISPS and ISM - International Ship and Port Security (“ISPS”) and International Safety Management code (“ISM”) 

certified shipyard

In FY2020, the Group conducted two fire evacuation drills to enhance the emergency preparedness of our workers.

occurred and assist us in identifying areas of potential risk and opportunities for improvement moving forward. 





Future Outlook and Performance Indicators

• 

Maintain zero workplace fatalities

• 

Lower incident frequency rate and severity rate for every year 

• 

Ensure every personnel being socially responsible towards the work environment 

SAFETY AGAINST COVID-19

In FY2020, the COVID-19 outbreak adversely impacted all industries and challenged our operations. Due to the pandemic, the 

local government implemented regulatory requirements and guidelines to contain the outbreak. Singapore implemented the Circuit 

Breaker measures from April to June 2020 and our operations halted as a result. Although our business faced disruptions and 

demand reduced due to project delays across the board, we prioritised the health and safety of our staff and workers amidst these 

difficult times. 

To ensure the safety of our workers living in the dormitory, they were quarantined in their dormitories even after the Circuit Breaker 

period. We also built Temporary Living Quarters to ensure that safe distancing measures can be successfully implemented in 

dormitories. Besides ensuring the physical health and safety of our workers, we are also deeply concerned with their mental well-

being, and we have counsellors to constantly check on their mental health and counsel them when needed.

In compliance with the regulations, we updated all employees on the current regulations and Safety Management Measures, such 

as daily temperature taking, work-from-home arrangements for office staff and the alternate team working arrangements when staff 

are back to work. Additionally, we stay abreast and comply with guidelines and regulations imposed by the Singapore government 

pertaining to the pandemic. 

The Group will continue to remain vigilant in the fight against the COVID-19 outbreak and ensure that all employees strictly comply 

with the COVID-19 safety regulations.

HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT

The Group regards our employees as our greatest asset in the achievement of success and growth. We always prioritise employee 

development, provide competitive employee benefits and ensure fair and safe working conditions to ensure staff retention and talent 

attraction.

Fair Employment

The Group continues its approach to providing diverse and equal opportunities to all our employees. Our policy on maintaining 

fairness and non-judgement regarding race, religion or nationality when assessing candidates continues to be paramount. The 

Group takes pride in assessing shortlisted candidates based solely on qualifications, relevant experience, skills and knowledge.

Our grievance management involves staff discussing any issues with their immediate superior. Depending on the gravity of the 

grievance or issue raised, it will either be resolved by the supervisor, or escalated to the Human Resource department or senior 

management where necessary. 

Training and Development

The Group is aware of the importance of providing continuous learning and upskilling for our employees. This allows for the 

continuous advancement of skills amongst our workforce. We provide targeted training for specific job scopes, for example, 

Construction Safety Orientation Course (“CSOC”) for crane operators, Shipyard Safety Instruction Course (“SSIC”) for shipyard 

workers, and Basic Offshore and Emergency Induction Training (“BOISIET”) for workers involved in offshore projects.

In FY2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our training schedule was disrupted, and planned trainings were cancelled as Singapore 

entered the Circuit Breaker period. Training centres resumed partially during Phase 2 post Circuit Breaker, with restrictions on the 

availability of training courses and headcount. Despite the economic slowdown in 2020, we foresee a recovery in the economy and 

more business opportunities in 2021. In preparation for the increase in business activities next year, we developed training plans to 

continue to upskill our employees and ensure our competitiveness in the market.

As the Group continues to venture into the Windfarm sector, we endeavour to equip our employees with Global Wind Organization 

(“GWO”) training standards. These trainings include, GWO Basic Safety Training, GWO First Aid, GWO Working At Height, GWO 

Sea Survival, GWO Fire Awareness and GWO Manual Handling.

The Group contributed a total of SDG $17,450 to training and development in FY2020. The list below provides a comprehensive 

overview of all training provided and the number of attendees per training.

Table 8. New Employee Hire &amp; Turnover for FY2020

The total employee count includes 247 seafarers, who are employed on short-term employment contracts or rotate out every quarter. 

The turnover in 2020 was lower than 2019 due to fewer seafarers being rotated out due to the COVID-19 restrictions. 

Future Outlook and Performance Indicators

The Group is still in the process of adopting the share option schemes including Kim Heng Employee Share Option Scheme (“Kim 

Heng ESOS”) and a performance share plan known as the Kim Heng Performance Share Plan (“Kim Heng PSP”). The aim of the 

Kim Heng ESOS and the Kim Heng PSP is to retain and reward employees in the future. Kim Heng is looking to initiate these plans 

within the next few years.

EMBRACING THE NEW ENERGY CHANGE

ETHICS AND ANTI-CORRUPTION

We recognise that ethics and corruption is a sensitive area in our industry. We understand that any breach of ethics and corruption 

can lead to significant reputational damage, legal consequences and loss of customers. Additionally, it puts the trust that we have 

built between our business and our stakeholders at great risk.

Management Approach

The Group’s maintains its zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption. Through established policies, sound corporate 

governance and internal controls, we strive for the utmost transparency and highest levels of corporate ethics. 

Our established anti-bribery and corruption (“ABC”) policy continues to provide guidance to management and staff on the measures 

for mitigating risks involving bribery and corruption. Further, the policy aims to address regulatory requirements and marketplace 

expectations accordingly.

The whistle-blowing policy, as set out in the Corporate Governance section of the FY2020 Annual Report, provides our staff with 

the ability to raise concerns on any suspicious wrongdoings discreetly and without repercussion, including improprieties in matters of 

financial reporting, fraudulent acts and other matters within the Group.

This year, all employees were briefed, trained and received communications on the ABC policy. We also included the ABC policy in 

a handbook as part of our induction process for new employees.

Performance

There have been no cases of anti-bribery and corruption reported or any whistle-blowing reports received in FY2020.  

Future Outlook and Performance Indicators

1. We will continue to provide training on anti-bribery and corruption to all new hires.

2. We will continue to provide all our employees with refresher courses on anti-bribery and whistle-blowing policy on an annual 

basis.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

The industry in which we operate is governed heavily by laws and regulations in the environmental, social and economic spheres of 

operation. Breaches of these laws and regulations can result in significant legal fines as well as reputational damage. 

Management Approach

The Group has an established management policy regarding the compliance with social and environmental laws. All staff continue 

to be informed and briefed on this policy. Additionally, we have a code of ethics that clearly defines our adherence to all legal 

standards regarding dealings in securities, contracts and any other provisions. Furthermore, we abide strictly to all governing laws 

and regulations, both domestic and international. 

Performance

The Group received no monetary fines, non-monetary sanctions, or have any open cases on social and economic non-compliance 

in FY2020.

Future Outlook and Performance Indicators

We aim to maintain zero cases of social and economic non-compliance in our operations.

FINANCIAL STABILITY

Through ensuring financial stability, the Group is able to continue operations to provide livelihoods for our staff and serve our 

stakeholders.

Management Approach

While the approach of improving cash flow and lowering credit risk is still valid, we have also included the diversification of our 

operational services to include sustainable avenues alike to the offshore windfarm.

Performance

The Group’s financial performance declined in FY2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in project delays across the 

board and led to reduced demand of our services. 

In FY2020, revenue fell by 35% year-on-year to S$37.6 million from S$58.1 million in FY2019. The reduction of S$20.5 million 

in revenue was driven by reduced demand across the board due to project delays caused by COVID-19 pandemic. Gross profit 

margin reduced to 20% in FY2020 from 27% in FY2019. The reduction in revenue was driven by reduced demand across the board 

due to project delays caused by COVID-19 pandemic.

In FY2020, cost of sales decreased by S$12.3 million or 29% to S$30.2 million in FY2020 from S$42.5 million in FY2019. 

Consequently, gross profit decreased by S$8.2 million or 52% to S$7.4 million in FY2020 from S$15.6 million in FY2019.

As of 31 December 2020, the Group’s cash and cash equivalents stood at S$6.2 million. The Group achieved a positive operating 

cash flow of S$3.6 million for FY2020 as compared to a positive operating cash flow of S$4.9 million in FY2019, due to lower 

revenue and profitability.

Future Outlook and Performance Indicators

Moving forward, we intend to focus on the growing global trend in providing opportunities for our offshore renewables segment 

in the long term. This is based on our expectations of increased contract wins for renewable projects and continued international 

expansion across new markets.

The group is proactively pursuing to diversify from the oil &amp; gas so to better position for the energy transition. As part of our plans 

to evolve into renewable energy, while leveraging on our knowledge transfer from offshore oil &amp; gas operations as well as Horizon 

Directional Drilling expertise, we are confident that we are able to capitalise on these strengths to pivot towards renewable energy 

in offshore wind projects.
