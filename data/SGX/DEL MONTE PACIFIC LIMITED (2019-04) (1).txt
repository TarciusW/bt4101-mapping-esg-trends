un Sustainable Development Goals

The united nations (un) released a 15-year 

agenda that was created by world leaders 

in September 2015. This was coined as the 

“Sustainable Development Goals” (SDGs). 

The Sustainable Development Goals are a 

call for action by all countries to promote 

prosperity while protecting the planet. They 

recognise that ending poverty must go hand-

in-hand with strategies that build economic 

growth and address a range of social needs, 

including education, health, social protection, 

and job opportunities, while tackling climate 

change and environmental protection.

The SDGs are aimed to materialise by 2030 

following the success of their predecessor 

Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were 

centered on eliminating poverty in all forms. 

Sustainable Development is defined by the un 

as “development that meets the needs of the 

present without compromising the ability of 

future generations to meet their own needs.”

The campaign calls for a collaborative effort to 

promote prosperity while protecting the planet 

with the main objective to end global poverty 

through the following:

•	

Build	economic	growth

•	

Address	social	needs:	education,	health,	

social protection and job opportunities

•	

Respond	to	climate	change,	environmental	

protection, and social injustices 

Source: united nations website on Sustainable Development Goals - https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/

our sustainability efforts are centered around nurturing a 

vibrant quality of life for current and future generations through 

accessible nutrition, caring for Earth’s goodness, and supporting 

people in our communities and workplace.

our materiality assessment had the following objectives:

1. identify the sustainability priorities, drawing on our knowledge of our internal and external resources to compile 

a list of issues specific to the food industry. We determined 30 environmental, social and governance priorities 

across 6 categories to frame our discussion.

2. Conduct a survey with internal 

stakeholders, i.e. employees, 

regarding the business impact 

of sustainability issues, which 

includes the scope and 

breadth of the issue, possible 

risk and magnitude of its 

impact, current regulatory 

and statutory regulations, and 

concerns from consumers, 

customers, communities and the 

government.

3. Send a similar survey to key 

external stakeholders to 

determine the issues they are 

concerned with and would 

like Del Monte to address. The 

external stakeholders include 

customers, government and 

community organisations, industry 

and trade associations, certification 

bodies, non-government 

organisations, business partners, 

suppliers, academe, lending 

institutions and investors.

aside from these priorities, 

we also included in our report 

some emerging issues – soil

and data protection, privacy 

and cybersecurity. Moreover, 

the Group provided a section in 

this report on climate change 

adaptation, energy efficiency, 

plant breeding, Corporate Social 

Responsibility and philanthropy 

as these are essential to our 

operations.

STAkEHOLDER INCLUSIVENESS

our sustainability journey begins 

with our stakeholders. They 

provide us an opportunity to 

engage in various tasks and help 

in their development, individually 

and collectively as a group.  We 

nurture meaningful relationships 

with our stakeholders to provide 

a better understanding of the 

Group’s operation, strengthen 

collaboration and engagement, 

improve communication and 

transparency, and identify and 

resolve stakeholder concerns.

How We Engage Our Stakeholders

The following outlines our key 

stakeholders and the manner 

in which we engage them and 

how they impact our operation.  

These stakeholder groups were 

identified according to their level 

of influence, interest and impact 

to the organisation.  

The Group needs to engage, 

to be more transparent, and to 

respond directly to stakeholder 

concerns, identify potential risks 

and improve performance.

REPORTING STANDARDS

We follow best practices and 

international guidelines in reporting 

our sustainability performance. The 

Group uses the Global Reporting 

initiative (GRi) Sustainability 

Reporting Guidelines as reference. 

The Group has integrated the 

sustainability strategies and 

embedded them in the organisation. 

our Quality Policy, Code of 

Conduct, Code of Business Ethics 

and Sustainability and Environmental 

Policies enable us to comply with 

the standards set by the GRi. This is 

closely monitored and reported, as 

illustrated throughout this report.                                                          

The Group’s companies are 

members of several sustainability-

related organisations. For example, 

Del Monte in the united States 

is affiliated with the Stewardship 

index for Specialty Crops, the uS 

Environmental Protection agency’s 

Pesticide Environmental Stewardship 

Programme, Sustainable Packaging 

Coalition and the Canned Food 

alliance Executive Committee. Both 

uSa and Philippines Companies are 

members of the Supplier Ethical 

Data Exchange.

We continue to focus on building 

the long-term resiliency of our 

business as we deepen our 

understanding of the global business 

environment while remaining 

mindful of the impact of our 

activities on the future of our planet.

We are guided by our vision, values 

and goals to provide health and 

wellness, environmental stewardship 

and employee welfare.

SCOPE AND INCLUSIVE PERIOD

Fully acknowledging our 

responsibility towards the future, 

the Corporate Sustainability team 

leads our efforts to increase 

sustainability advocacy amongst our 

stakeholders. Key leaders have been 

oriented on sustainable business 

and sustainability reporting. Each 

team has set goals to materialise 

commitments to our overall effort 

and recognise individual share of 

accountability.

Each business unit has identified 

its material sustainability issues by 

location which may differ from 

the Group’s material issues given 

the business model employed by 

the business units. as an example, 

our company in the Philippines 

does the cultivation, planting and 

harvesting of pineapples, while our 

uS subsidiary uses contract growers 

to source its fruits, tomatoes and 

vegetables.

The sustainability report period is 

from May 2018 to april 2019, i.e. 

Fy2019, in line with our financial 

year. We have excluded our indian 

joint venture business from this 

report since its contribution to the 

total business is not material.

we are passionate about cultivating 

good food for a better life by 

bringing high-quality, healthy 

and nutritious food to our 

consumers. our brands are some 

of the best known and most 

trusted in the marketplace. it is 

our commitment to ensure we 

maintain and keep this trust.

We produce globally competitive 

food products in the safest 

way possible. The Group has 

comprehensive quality and 

food safety policies that ensure 

its products are of the highest 

quality and meet the strictest 

food safety standards.

Consumers are becoming 

increasingly interested in learning 

about the ingredients in their food 

and are often looking for positive 

health properties such as low-

fat or low-sugar. This emphasis 

Consumers enjoying Del Monte Bubble Fruit Cups

on health impacts and benefits 

has ongoing implications for 

product design and sourcing.

We are committed to health and 

nutrition, and consumers trust 

our brands.  We actively work to 

ensure that our brands maintain this

The Group is committed to product 

innovation in coming up with new 

and reformulated products based 

on consumer trends and changing 

preferences to healthy and nutritious 

food products.

The Group’s food safety policies 

ensure that consumers understand 

our commitment to providing food 

products that conform to food 

safety standards, and to regulatory 

requirements through a food safety 

management system. We require 

our toll manufacturers to adhere to 

the same commitment in delivering 

our products to market. Preventive 

Controls Qualified individual (PCQi) 

certificates are given to all facility 

managers in the uS as part of the 

Food Safety Modernisation act. 

Facility managers of DMPi-owned 

and Toll Manufacturing facilities 

exporting to the uS also have PCQi 

certificates.  

our agro-industrial processes are 

accredited by the world’s leading 

food certifying bodies, Global 

Food Safety initiative (GFSi) or 

British Retail Consortium (BRC), 

with 88 quality audits across 

our production facilities and toll 

manufacturers in the united States, 

and 23 audits in the Philippines. 

The audits were performed during 

the year by reputable, independent 

international auditors, business 

partners and customers. audit 

results confirm that our processes 

meet or exceed standards for 

the supply and export of food 

products to certain countries.

Part of our commitment to 

ensure that our products are safe, 

is having a robust traceability 

programme in place for the Group. 

With globalisation, our products 

reach more consumers. in order 

to protect consumers’ health, the 

traceability programme allows us 

to quickly identify the origin of the 

product should an event arise - 

from its source and production to 

retailer. With this knowledge, we 

are equipped to handle consumer 

questions with confidence and in 

a timely manner. Having a reliable 

traceability programme enables 

the Group to have an effective 

and efficient process to identify a 

defective product or component 

and to execute the recall process if 

warranted.

DMPL Chief Corporate Officer Luis F Alejandro

We are a people-driven organisation 

committed to growing wellness 

and a high quality of life through 

harmonious working relationships with 

all stakeholders, including customers, 

employees, business partners and 

investors. Some 6,100 regular 

employees of the Group work at our 

plantation, manufacturing facilities, 

administrative and marketing offices. 

about 1,700 regular employees work 

in the united States and Mexico, while 

4,400 are employees based in the 

Philippines and Singapore.

Given that our employees are our most 

valuable resource, we are committed 

to ensuring:

1. occupational health and safety;

2. Human rights and labour 

standards;

3. Fair wages and benefits;

4. Employee engagement;

5. Well-being and work-life 

integration; and

6. Talent management.

Because we value the lives of every 

member of the organisation, work 

committees identify potential safety 

risks and hazards, and devise action 

plans to mitigate or avoid their 

occurrences. Safety programmes 

are implemented and process 

improvements are made to ensure 

workplace health and safety.

With regard to human rights and 

labour standards, the Group has a 

Code of Conduct for employees and 

suppliers. Both DMFi and DMPi are 

members of the Supplier Ethical Data 

Exchange to ensure compliance. 

Discrimination on the grounds of 

nationality, ethnicity, religion, age and 

gender violates the aforementioned 

Group’s Code of Business Ethics. 

We are also committed to ensuring 

employees get fair wages and 

benefits. in the  Philippines, Del 

Monte complements government-

mandated privileges for all full-time 

employees and qualified dependents 

with a broad range of free medical 

and dental services, a comprehensive 

retirement package and voluntary 

plans for providential and insurance 

benefits. Moreover, memorandums 

of agreement with the labour 

unions stipulate wage increases and 

enhancements in benefits for farm 

and factory workers annually. 

additionally, we strive to build a 

culture of engagement, which entails 

the involvement of everyone in the 

organisation.

 

The Group encourages employees to 

maintain a healthy work-life balance.   

Del Monte helps employees integrate 

their work with their personal lives. 

Providing employees programmes 

that help balance their work and 

family life will help employees fulfill 

their goals both inside and outside 

work.

We nurture our employees through 

Del Monte’s “Roadmap to Global 

Competitiveness” in the Philippines 

which starts with building on the 

capabilities of each employee with 

the Centre of Excellence on Talent 

Management. We have developed 

a competency framework for key 

leaders at the plantation, cannery and 

marketing that will guide their teams 

towards achieving the Company’s 

strategic roadmap.

The success of our business is 

intertwined with responsible 

stewardship of nature, which is the 

source of our products. as such, 

we continuously improve our 

agricultural practices and oversight 

of growers, and communicate 

our Environmental Policy to our 

stakeholders.

our Environmental Policy is updated 

periodically to reflect new advances 

in best practice and better serve the 

Group’s operating needs. 

in the uS, Del Monte connects 

consumers with our growers by 

developing information pertaining 

to where their food is picked and 

packed at the peak of ripeness. 

The Company provides detailed 

information on how vegetables are 

grown through new sophisticated 

software and partnership with the 

Stewardship index of Specialty 

Crops (SiSC) organisation.  as an 

active participant in SiSC, we analyse 

on-farm metrics with growers, track 

and monitor agricultural inputs to 

drive continuous improvement, and 

gain efficiencies.

Del Monte in the uSa partners with 

a third-party vendor, CropTrak™, 

to use their crop data management 

system to track traceability and 

sustainability metrics, and customer 

audit information. CropTrak™ 

allows us to house the data in one 

central repository to facilitate more 

dynamic communication with 

operations and partners. CropTrak™ 

also helps us improve our harvest 

and pack projections. The system 

is also a portal that can collect 

and disseminate contractual and 

educational information within 

the value chain such as Good 

agricultural Practices of our growers 

in planting cover crops and working 

with qualified agronomists. 

DMFi’s dedicated agricultural Seed 

operations Research Team has a 

plant breeding programme, using 

the classic method of selecting the 

best plant qualities to produce a new 

generation in an outdoor laboratory. 

The team provides growers with 

majority of our seeds for certain 

crops, including Blue lake, Romano 

and wax beans, and other crops 

such as peas, corn and spinach. We 

are able to generate a higher yield 

for our corn and green beans.

Preserving Nature

our research agronomists and plant breeders develop and improve our  

varieties so farmers grow more food with less resources while conserving  

the environment.

in a single year, Del Monte tests 

over 3,000 genetically distinct, new 

and upcoming varieties. if a variety 

performs consistently and fills a 

niche, this is added to the Del Monte 

approved Variety list.  This is scaled 

up to seed production to meet field 

department demand, and becomes 

a standard variety used by Del Monte 

locations to produce quality Del 

Monte vegetables.

as we work to identify key 

characteristics of our plants, 

we keep the viewpoints of our 

customers and growers in mind. 

Their insights around hardiness 

and taste provide the direction 

for the next generation of our 

seeds and products. ultimately, we 

test for taste, harvest cleanliness, 

yield, disease resistance, nutrient 

management, and factory 

performance.

in the Philippines, the foundation 

of DMPi’s sustainable agriculture 

practices is efficient land use. 

Ecologically-minded land use 

management was carried on from 

our pioneers who started farming in 

1926. These pioneers did not clear 

forests to give way to pineapple 

fields. additional land acquired 

later by our pioneers was already 

cultivated for other crops. 

across over 90 years of operations, 

our land use practices have 

been mainly aimed at improving 

plantation yield through ecologically 

friendly land preparation, use of 

sustainable planting materials, plant 

disease management and chemical 

application, and efficient water 

sourcing and drainage. 

Part of our Quality Policy in the 

Philippines is our commitment 

to environmental standards and 

sustainability objectives, statutory 

and regulatory compliance, and 

continuous improvement of our 

Pineapple plantation in Bukidnon, Philippines

quality system by adhering to the 

highest ethical standards within our 

operations and in dealing with our 

business partners.

Maintaining proper soil health 

and nutrient balance are vital to 

producing healthy, high-quality 

fruits and vegetables, and addressing 

some of the world’s environmental

Using drones to map the pineapple plantation 

in Bukidnon

Pineapple plantation in Bukidnon, Philippines

leveraging technology is part of 

our plan to improve our agricultural 

practices and transforms our 

systems to become world class. 

our Drone Programme allows us 

to monitor the condition of the 

26,000-hectare pineapple field 

in Bukidnon, Philippines. Global 

Positioning System (GPS) technology 

is also being used to monitor the 

plantation and truck deliveries to 

ensure efficiency, productivity and 

safety at work.

DMPl safeguards the environment 

by focusing on these areas:

 

(1) Fertiliser and pesticide use; 

(2) Water management;

(3) Soil management; 

(4)  Climate change adaptation and 

energy efficiency; 

(5) Waste management; and

(6)  Biodiversity and the environment 

protection.

We help growers apply the principles 

of integrated Pest Management 

(iPM) to minimise the amount of 

pesticides used to control insects, 

other pests and crop diseases. Del 

Monte researchers also investigate 

crop density as a way to increase 

yield per hectare while cutting 

pesticide and fertiliser use.

on water management, we work 

with our growers to implement the 

least water-intensive cultivation 

methods possible and encourage 

the use of more water-efficient 

irrigation systems and techniques 

to use less water. our agricultural 

teams work closely with local 

farmers to adopt agronomic 

measures that can mitigate adverse 

consequences of crop agriculture 

on soil and water conservation. 

Maintaining proper soil health and 

nutrient balance is vital to producing 

healthy, high-quality fruits and 

vegetables, and addressing some 

of the world’s environmental 

challenges, including carbon 

sequestration. Since efficient 

management of soil directly impacts 

our long-term productivity, we are 

focused on regenerating topsoil and 

improving diversity, on the ground 

and even below the ground.

DMFi’s approach to climate change 

is two-fold—we try to mitigate our 

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 

and adapt our operations and supply 

chain to the potential impact of 

climate change. Del Monte Foods 

also minimises carbon footprint by 

locating processing plants close to 

the fields where crops are grown. 

additionally, the Group continually 

assesses investment opportunities in 

renewable energy solutions in each 

of our facilities.

There are not many companies that 

are carbon negative or even carbon 

neutral. less carbon emissions are 

better for the environment. While 

most manufacturing companies, 

including food companies, are 

carbon positive, meaning they 

emit more carbon dioxide into the 

atmosphere than they sequester 

or absorb, the carbon footprint of 

Del Monte Philippines, inc (DMPi) 

is negative. DMPi is a leading 

manufacturer of food and beverages 

which is uniquely positioned 

amongst food companies to help 

mitigate climate change.  

DMPi is the largest producer of 

pineapples in the country and its 

vast 26,000-hectare pineapple 

plantation and forest areas reduce 

the amount of carbon dioxide, 

offsetting any emissions in the 

atmosphere. DMPi plants various 

timber trees in plantation camps, 

company grounds and facilities. 

Bamboos are planted along field 

boundaries and non-arable land.

Preserving Nature

The best innovations 

in agriculture today 

are those that ensure 

sustainability of 

tomorrow.

We also aim to reduce the 

overall consumption and usage 

of raw materials in all facets of 

our operation, including toll 

manufacturers. in line with this, we 

encourage the reuse of materials 

in all areas of operation. We 

promote the concept of recycling, 

the benefits of utilising recycled 

materials, and environmentally safe 

and responsible material disposal. 

We continue to undertake many 

initiatives during the year to reduce 

process residues, strengthen energy 

conservation in all worksites and 

explore more efficient energy 

sources.

FERTILISER AND PESTICIDE USE

1. Del Monte field staff and 

growers closely monitor 

crop conditions through field 

scouting, pheromone traps 

and cultural tools to help avoid 

situations that could contribute 

to pest outbreaks. 

2. By limiting pesticide use, 

we reduce the probability of 

contaminated runoff from 

fields, protect the health of farm 

workers, prevent the destruction 

of beneficial insects and other 

field organisms, and ultimately 

decrease the chance that any 

pesticide residue remains on the 

crop when it is harvested and 

processed. 

3. Del Monte in the uSa 

participated in a number of 

iPM-related partnerships and 

initiatives to share knowledge 

and best practice.

4. Del Monte researchers 

investigate crop density as a way 

to increase yield per hectare 

while cutting pesticide and 

fertiliser use. We continue to 

explore the possibility of rolling 

out high-density techniques to 

other crops. 

5. DMFi provides our growers with 

plants that are naturally resistant 

to plant diseases and insects, 

thus reducing fertiliser and 

chemical use in farms. 

6. our field staff educate and 

solicit feedback from our 

farmers on how to best grow 

these plants and implement 

pest control and crop disease 

mitigation strategies.

7. Due to these improvements 

over the last 50 years, we have 

reduced our spraying from an 

average of 7 applications, with 

a total of 2 kilograms of active 

pesticidal ingredient, to 1.5 

applications and 90 grams of 

active ingredient. 

8. in addition, we reduced our 

application energy usage by 

over 85%.

9. We actively complete laboratory 

tests for pesticide residues for 

over 2,000 products each year. 

if we find any pesticide, we 

remove it from our products and 

the fields where our growers 

cultivated them. 

10. This feedback loop means we 

closely examine the impact 

that new pesticides might 

have on our products, and that 

we develop higher standards 

of growing.  We continue to 

explore the possibility of rolling 

out high-density techniques to 

other crops.

WATER MANAGEMENT

1. in the united States, our growers 

use various irrigation systems 

to supplement natural rainfall 

and ensure a steady and reliable 

water supply for their crops. 

2. Del Monte evaluates and 

prioritises water risk based on 

local availability and quality in 

areas where our plants operate 

as well as at the farm level where 

we contract with growers. 

3. We show our concern for 

water scarcity through stronger 

regulations and more calls 

for water use monitoring and 

management.    

4. 98% of Del Monte tomato 

growers utilise drip irrigation, a 

less water-intensive cultivation 

method, for targeted application 

of water and fertiliser.

5. Presently, 78% of our facilities 

have high or extremely high-

water stress, which is why we 

capture and reuse water at our 

facilities.

6. We recycle the cooling water 

from our cans and use it to run 

our cooling towers to reduce 

fresh water and energy usage.

7. in order to reduce fresh water 

usage and avoid water treatment 

costs, DMPi uses the condensate 

(water from steam and pineapple 

juice) of our evaporators and 

permeate (water from mill juice) 

from our Reverse osmosis (Ro) 

system for ultrafiltration System 

CiP and ion Exchange Plants 

regeneration. 

8. our bottling plant operations 

measure the Water use Ratio 

(WuR), i.e. total cubic meter of 

water used per MT of finished 

product, or the volume of 

groundwater used per volume of 

beverage product. our WuR in 

the bottling plant for Fy2019 is 

10.6, 6% below prior period and 

the 11.0 maximum target.

9. Some of the initiatives of the 

bottling plant to improve water 

management are:

 

•	

	Installation	of	new	RO	

machine system

 

•	

	Backwashing	activity	was	

reduced from 8 times/ month 

to twice/month

 

•	

	Optimisation	of	rinsing	time	

during Clean-in-place (CiP)

 

•	

	Installation	of	soft	water	line	

control timer for shutdown 

operation

 

•	

	Attend	training	for	awareness	

on water treatment from third 

party suppliers

10. our toll manufacturers have water 

conservation programmes to 

eliminate waste and reduce water 

usage. Wastewater discharges 

of all toll manufacturing lines 

are within regulatory standards. 

WuR in beverage and culinary toll 

manufacturers are monitored and 

reduced each year.

SOIL MANAGEMENT

1. To facilitate soil management, 

DMFi asks growers to:

 

a.  Conduct consistent soil 

sampling to manage soil 

fertility and health

 

b.  apply our model pesticide 

control programme

 

c.  use pest-resistant varieties 

where available 

 

d.  Rotate crops to minimise 

the effect of soil insects and 

diseases 

Preserving Nature

48

del monte pacific limited sustainability report Fy2019






2. Del Monte in the uS encourages 

our farmers to work with 

qualified plant and soil scientists, 

or agronomists, to develop 

innovative farm practices and 

technologies.

3. These technologies are 

harnessed and implemented to 

boost crop yields, control pests 

and weeds, and protect the 

environment. understanding the 

agronomics of a new variety in 

a growing area is important for 

adaptation to the environment.

4. in the Philippines, landholdings 

are leased by the Company 

from landowners by virtue of 

their respective ownership 

or stewardship documents 

as attested by government 

agencies. 

5. For better soil and drainage 

management, the Crop Growing 

units implement deepening 

of ditches and install auxiliary 

canals and silting basins specially 

designed for each field. 

6. Trees and shrubs are planted 

along river easement near 

pineapple fields to prevent soil 

erosion.

7. To reduce soil erosion, DMPi 

implements a block lay-

out system depending on 

topography and utilises drone 

image for topography maps and 

hydrology analysis for a more 

accurate design.  The Company 

also installs catchment basins  

in strategic locations around  

the field.

8. DMPi uses precision instruments 

for better land preparation to 

avoid soil compaction, crusting 

and damage to soil structure.

9. The Company makes use of a 

soil and water assessment tool 

programme to monitor the 

health status of our soil and 

water resources.

10. We also reinforce technical 

competency through continuous 

training and education on soil 

management to reduce soil 

erosion in our plantation.

CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION 

AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY 

1. as early as 2009, Del Monte in 

the uSa installed 6,400 solar 

panels covering over 37 square 

kilometres and producing 1.2 

MW or more than 8% of total 

electricity requirements during 

non-pack season at our primary 

tomato production facility in 

Hanford, California. 

2. The solar panel installation at 

our Hanford facility has enabled 

us to become a member of the 

Environmental Protection agency 

(EPa) Green Power Programme.

3. Del Monte’s Modesto plant 

installed a combined heat and 

power system, selective catalytic 

reduction unit, condensing 

economiser and backpressure 

turbine generator in its boiler 

system which cut natural gas use 

by 20%.

4. at least 50% of our facilities utilise 

our company-wide programme 

to install condensing economisers 

and improve heat recovery 

and steam system efficiency.  

We continue to expand this 

programme across other facilities. 

5. in the uSa, our crops are locally 

sourced and travel less than an 

average of 160 kilometres from 

the field to the manufacturing 

gate and an average of 560 

kilometres from distribution 

centre to retailer.

The use of novel technologies, such as GPS devices and unmanned aerial 

drones, has resulted in improved field layouts that have greatly contributed  

to our soil conservation efforts.

Benjamin Z Mabanta, Senior Manager, Plantation Spray operations

6. Six facilities installed condensing 

boiler stack economisers to 

use hot exhaust gases from 

boilers to preheat water in a 

heat-exchanger system which 

improves the operating efficiency 

of the boilers by up to 12%, 

reducing the amount of natural 

gas needed to run the boilers by 

the same percentage.

7. Since 2015, we have eliminated 

3.7 million kilometres (the 

equivalent of approximately 

1,476,310 litres of diesel fuel) 

from our distribution network 

through a variety of initiatives.

8. DMFi is a participant in the uS 

EPa’s SmartWay public-private 

programme that measures 

and benchmarks freight 

transportation efficiency in an 

effort to improve supply chain 

sustainability.

9. our carbon footprint in 

the Philippines has a net 

sequestration of 570,273 MT 

Co2 making the DMPi carbon 

negative.

fundamentals remain on solid

Specific to distributor operations, 

Fy2019 was a year of transformation 

as the Group worked to upgrade 

operations and processes. as some 

of its legacy distributors have lagged 

in terms of modernisation required, 

the Group felt it necessary to 

transition out of these distributors 

and replace them with those that 

could support the level of expansion 

that the Group expects, particularly in 

a fast-changing, highly competitive 

environment. While the transition 

impacted Philippine market sales in 

Fy2019, the Group believes it will 

help set up a stronger base for future 

growth.  improvements are expected 

to be seen beginning in the first 

quarter of Fy2020.
