BOARD STATEMENT 

GRI 102-14 

Heeton prides itself on its international portfolio of distinctive, high-quality properties in the 

residential, commercial and hospitality sectors, and its success in delivering stakeholder value by 

converting opportunity into growth. 

With 13 hotels in our property portfolio as at December 2019, we are on track to become a strategic 

player on the international hospitality stage. We are, however, very aware of the environmental and 

societal responsibility that this growth brings. Heeton recognises that its development strategy must 

consider the wider expectations of all its stakeholders, including customers, employees and investors. 

We will continue to create value for our shareholders while benefitting all stakeholders through 

actions to reduce negative societal and environmental impact. 

We regularly review key aspects of our real estate and hospitality operations – including workplace 

health and safety, and our consumption of natural resources – to ensure our conformity to global 

standards and local regulatory requirements. As well as benefitting society and the environment, such 

reviews also improve our economic efficiency. Our evolution towards more sustainable practices also 

attracts a new generation of talent, and customers who are more environmentally conscious. 

In addition to strong internal governance policies that ensure high ethical standards in compliance, 

transparency and business conduct, Heeton adheres to management approaches and targets for 

talent retention, health and safety, supplier assessment, and energy and water efficiency. 

Heeton’s Board oversees the Group’s sustainability strategy and the development of policies and 

management structures to monitor and report our social and environmental performance.  

This Sustainability Report highlights our achievements and targets in key material areas and efforts to 

positively impact our stakeholders. It is based on 10 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 

factors that represent key risks and opportunities for our business and address the concerns of our 

stakeholders. 

While we continue expanding our hospitality business, we will strive to improve sustainability 

reporting in our global operations and throughout our value chain. 

Thank you for your interest in Heeton’s 2019 Sustainability Report. We welcome feedback from all our 

stakeholders and look forward to continuing our journey towards a more sustainable future.

Our Company  

GRI 102-1, 102-2, 102-3, 102-4, 102-5, 102-6, 102-7, 102-45 

Heeton Holdings Limited (Heeton) is a real estate company focused on property development, 

investment and management. Established in 1976, the company was listed on the Singapore Stock 

Exchange in September 2003, and has since extended its business frontiers beyond Singapore to 

Thailand, Australia, Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam and the United Kingdom. As a boutique property 

developer, Heeton enjoys a reputation for distinctive and high quality developments in the choicest 

districts of some of the world’s major cities including Singapore, London and Bangkok. Heeton has also 

formed strong partnerships with other established real estate groups to develop properties locally 

and internationally.  

Heeton’s growth in the property industry is underpinned by a stable real estate portfolio that includes 

commercial properties (shopping malls and serviced offices) and hotels. The group is currently 

exploring further acquisitions. Heeton entered the hospitality sector in 2011 with the acquisition of 

the Mercure Hotel Pattaya, Thailand. Following an aggressive expansion programme the Company’s 

hotel portfolio has now increased to 13 properties worldwide, as at 2019. Developing the hotel 

division will be a key priority for Heeton, with the objective of becoming a prominent player on the 

international hospitality stage.  

For more details on Heeton’s profile, ownership, structure and list of properties, please see the 

Group’s Annual Report on our website (www.heeton.com).

OUR GOVERNANCE  

GRI 102-16, 102-18 

Heeton considers high ethical standards in compliance, transparency, and business conduct to be the 

key to lasting stakeholder trust and confidence. To ensure that we run our operations and grow our 

business with integrity, we have implemented robust governance-related policies and procedures. 

Our Board oversees the corporate governance structure and sustainability strategy of the Group. It is 

also responsible for the overall management and reporting of sustainability performance and receives 

regular reports on sustainability-related issues from the relevant heads of business units. These 

managers also participate in the development of Heeton’s sustainability policies and are in charge of 

integrating appropriate practices and procedures into our operations. 

Our employees are expected to conduct themselves with honesty and integrity at work. Heeton’s code 

of conduct is included in the Group’s Employee Handbook, together with regulations and guidelines 

on issues such as discipline, confidentiality, and intellectual property. 

PREVENTING CORRUPTION 

GRI 205-2, 205-3 

Heeton is committed to upholding a high level of business ethics and integrity, including amongst our 

suppliers and business partners. We believe that the prevention of corruption in our value chain is 

vital to safeguard the interests of our stakeholders and Heeton’s reputation. All forms of corruption 

are forbidden: this encompasses dishonest business practices such as conflict of interest, acceptance 

of gifts, or improper use of insider information.  

Employees are required to adhere to our corporate policies on anti-corruption, anti-money 

laundering, whistle-blowing, and blackout periods. All new hires are required to go through a 

mandatory induction programme where they are made aware of these policies, and our code of 

conduct and procedures.  

We are pleased to report that there were no incidents of corruption at our headquarters or managed 

hotels during FY2019. 

Our whistleblowing policy aims to encourage responsible and secure reporting of any incident of 

violation or suspected violation of our code of conduct, such as unethical or illegal practices. Should 

such an incident occur, it should be reported to a member of Heeton’s management.  

In case of any dissatisfaction with the handling of such a report, the matter can be escalated to the 

Executive Deputy Chairman or the Audit Committee Chairman.

 Heeton Holdings Limited Sustainability Report FY2019 

ENSURING COMPLIANCE  

GRI 307-1, 419-1 

Compliance with environmental and social laws is the baseline to meet stakeholders’ expectations and 

maintain the license to operate.  

Our operations and properties in Singapore are subject to multiple laws and regulations, such as the 

Workplace Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection and Management Act and the Energy 

Conservation Act, covering air pollution, noise, wastewater discharge and other environmental 

impacts. For our overseas portfolio, including our property developments, we abide by all applicable 

environmental and social legislations.  

We actively identify and manage our regulatory risks and we keep abreast of developments in 

sustainability-related law and related legislative updates. We also ensure that our suppliers and 

partners abide by all relevant regulations. 

In FY2019, our operations bore no incidence of non-compliance with laws and regulations in the 

environmental social and economic areas resulting in significant fines or sanctions. Looking forward, 

we will continue our efforts to ensure full environmental and social compliance in all our operations 

and to further reduce our environmental impacts.  

MANAGING ESG ISSUES IN OUR VALUE CHAIN 

Heeton promotes sustainability across its value chain. The nature of our real estate business often 

requires the appointment of a third-party service provider, or collaboration with a joint venture 

partner. We recognise the importance of maintaining transparency and working responsibly with 

these external parties and others in our value chain.  

We prioritise suppliers and contractors who engage in sustainable practices to ensure safe working 

conditions and respect worker rights. All Heeton’s suppliers are encouraged to adhere to best 

practices and industry standards, such as obtaining Building and Construction Authority (BCA) 

certifications.  

We also conduct regular checks on our suppliers and business partners for anti-money laundering or 

other unethical practices. This includes keeping a close watch on news coverage related to our joint 

venture partners, and ensuring that any ESG issues are addressed promptly.  

Our supply chain 

GRI 102-9 

In Singapore, the majority of our suppliers are locally based and comprise utilities providers and 

agencies for office supply, information technology, travel and maintenance tasks at our 

headquarters. Our two managed investment properties in Singapore rely on external providers for 

cleaning, security, pest control and other maintenance services. Our six managed hotels in the UK 

rely on hundreds of small-to-large suppliers, including food, beverage and professional service 

providers.  

We ensure that suppliers’ personnel are covered by our internal policies and requirements, such as 

safety and security, when they are working at our premises.

GROWING WITH OUR PEOPLE  

In our rapidly changing business landscape, the attraction, recruitment and retention of skilled 

employees with relevant and current expertise is important. We recognise the value that our 

employees bring to the Group and are proud of their contribution to our on-going success and 

sustainability. 

DIVERSIFYING OUR WORKFORCE 

GRI 102-7, 102-8, 405-1 

Heeton’s human resource policies are grounded in equal opportunities and fair employment practices. 

In our recruitment process, all qualified candidates are considered without discrimination of gender, 

age, ethnicity, religion and national origin. Our employees are promoted based on merit and 

performance. We also value the expertise of older employees and continue to employ individuals over 

the national retirement age. 

As at 31 December 2019, our headquarters had 43 employees and our six hotels in the UK employed 

130 people, making a total workforce of 173 for the Group. Of these, 16 (9.3% of total workforce) held 

a senior management position, 54 (31.2%) held manager or executive roles, and 103 (59.5%) were 

non-executives. The proportion of non-executive staff was significantly higher at the UK hotels 

compared to at our headquarters, being 91 (70% of their workforce), and 12 (27.9%) respectively.  

In terms of employment types, the ratio of full-time over part-time employees was 41:2 (95.3%:4.7%) 

for the headquarters and 91:39 (70.0%:30.0%) for the UK hotels. The proportion of temporary 

employees was relatively similar at headquarters as in the UK hotels, with respectively seven 

employees (16.3%) and 15 employees (11.5%) under a temporary contract. 

Women made up 60.5% (26 women compared to 17 males) and 55.4% (72 women compared to 58 

males) of our headquarters and UK hotels’ workforce respectively. As shown in the charts below, the 

proportion of women was higher in manager, executive and non-executive positions, while employees 

aged 30 years and above held most of the senior management, manager and executive roles.

VALUING AND RETAINING OUR EMPLOYEES 

GRI 401-1, 403-3 

In recognition of their contribution to the success of Heeton’s business, and to retain our skilled 

workforce, we reward employees with competitive salaries in line with market standards. 

Compensation to individual employees is determined by their position, competency and performance. 

Furthermore, employees are entitled to a variety of benefits, such as medical care, paid annual leave 

and birthday leave. They can also opt for a flexible work arrangement.  

Our Employee Handbook provides general guidelines about our policies, procedures and practices, 

terms and conditions, as well as the compensation and benefits package available to them. 

In FY2019, the Group hire rate was 41.6%, with a total of 72 new employees hired during the year. At 

the headquarters, the hire rate was 27.9% (12 new employees), while the hire rate was 46.1% (60 new 

employees) at the UK hotels. The hire rates for female employees were 30.8% (eight new employees) 

for the headquarters and 51.4% (37 new employees) for the UK hotels. Comparatively, the hire rates 

for male employees were 25.5% (four new employees) for the headquarters and 39.7% (23 new 

employees) for the UK hotels. 

During the year, our headquarters had a turnover rate of 11.6% with five employees leaving the 

company, while the turnover rate at our UK hotels was 53.1% with 69 leavers, making a global rate of 

42.8% for the entire Group. In terms of gender, male employees had the highest turnover with a global 

rate of 56% (42 leavers), compared to 32.6% (32 leavers) for the female employees.  

We believe the high turnover rate at our UK hotels was due to sector uncertainties within the context 

of Brexit. In FY2020, we will strengthen our effort to keep our employee turnover rates below the 

2019 values.

ENHANCING THE SKILLS OF OUR EMPLOYEES 

GRI 404-1, 404-3 

In a dynamic business environment, Heeton recognises the need to arm its employees with the new 

skills necessary to sustain our growth.  

Our active approach to learning supports the personal and professional development of our 

employees through training programmes designed to empower them to reach their full potential and 

keep them abreast of new technologies and opportunities in the real estate sector. Training is carried 

out on topics including management and leadership, information technology (e.g. cybersecurity) and 

safety (e.g. first aid). 

We also encourage employees to attend external courses for their professional development. Our 

employees can apply for financial sponsorship for eligible courses and be granted up to seven days of 

study leave per year. 

Our Human Resources Department tracks and monitors the training records of employees. One-on-

one reviews are conducted post-training to highlight any gaps in the programme or identify new 

training needs. Globally, each of Heeton’s employees completed an average of 15.2 training hours 

during FY2019. This represents a significant increase compared to FY2018’s global average of 5.2 hours 

per employee. This increase was as a result of greater training requirements for our UK workforce 

amidst the continuous expansion of our hospitality operations.   

Non-executive personnel at our UK hotels benefitted from the highest number of training hours, with 

an average of 22 hours in FY2019, while headquarters non-executive employees received an average 

of 5.2 training hours each.  

We conduct annual reviews with employees during which we discuss performance and career goals 

to support their professional growth. In FY2019, 54.3% of our global workforce received feedback on 

their performance and suggestions on improvement from their supervisors.  

We will continue to engage with our employees to fine-tune our training programmes and align them 

to their learning needs.

OUR SAFETY PRACTICES  

GRI 403-1, 403-2, 403-3, 403-4, 403-5, 403-7, 403-9, 416-1, 416-2 

As an employer and landlord, Heeton recognises its responsibility to ensure that our employees, 

customers and all other users of our premises can enjoy a safe and healthy environment.  

We regularly assess our safety practices to identify potential hazards within our operations. Risk 

assessment is reviewed and updated to follow preventive and corrective action plans.  

We provide an open channel of communication across all levels of the Group to gather feedback on 

issues relating to health and safety. In addition, we aim to inculcate a culture of ownership for health 

and safety among employees and tenants through regular safety education and training, including fire 

drills and first aid courses.  

As part of their induction, operational teams complete an on-line health and safety training 

programme and must familiarise themselves with their workplace. They are also instructed to report 

any hazards identified. Where required, suppliers and visitors to the premises must sign in and are 

supervised by our trained employees.  

Standard safety procedures and contingency plans have been established at all our properties and 

hotels. This includes internal and external audits, fire safety practices and regular fire safety audits 

and drills led by our property managers. Equipment is inspected and upgraded whenever necessary 

to ensure that it is in sound working condition. The property managers also ensure timely renewal of 

operating permits and licenses for fire safety installations, lifts and escalators and areas of high safety 

risks. 

Moreover, the importance of safety is emphasised during engagements with third-party service 

providers. In our development projects, weekly health and safety meetings are conducted by the main 

contractor along with Heeton’s project manager. We also conduct regular site visits to ensure that our 

main contractor is complying with all health and safety requirements. Corrective actions are enforced 

for any on-site safety concerns.  

In FY2019, no Heeton employees suffered workplace fatalities. Neither were there any incidents of 

non-compliance with regulations or voluntary codes concerning the health and safety impacts of our 

managed developments.  

Going forward, Heeton will stay committed to promoting occupational and customer health and 

safety, preventing non-compliance, and maintaining zero fatalities among our employees and other 

users of our buildings.

OUR IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT  

GRI 102-11 

Both the real estate and the hospitality sectors are high consumers of resources, such as energy and 

water. Heeton recognises that it should not delay taking appropriate actions to reduce its 

environmental impact.  

In this respect, we have already adopted green practices to improve resource conservation. These 

include energy and water usage reduction measures such as LED lighting, motion-sensor light switches 

water saving practices and water-efficient equipment, implemented at our offices, properties and 

hotels.  

Monthly reports on energy and water consumption at our investment properties are reviewed by our 

management to detect any irregularities and take appropriate actions. At our hotels, tracking of 

energy and water consumption is done via an online tool to ensure the efficiency of implemented 

resource conservation measures. 

We promote environmental awareness among our employees and tenants through e-mails on best

GRI 302-1, 302-3, 305-1, 305-2 

In FY2019, Heeton consumed a total of 91,266 GJ in energy (48,451 GJ in FY2018), 33% of which was 

consumed by our activities in Singapore and 67% by our UK properties. 58,3% of the total energy 

consumed comprised natural gas used by our UK hotels, while the remaining 41.7% was purchased 

electricity. Our two managed investment properties in Singapore were our biggest electricity 

consumers with 29,841 GJ (close to 8.3 million kWh). Comparatively, our six UK hotels consumed 7,993 

GJ (about 2,2 million kWh) of electricity. 

ENERGY CONSUMPTION3 (GLOBAL - FY2019) 

 

 

3 Energy and emissions figures are compiled using the latest Singapore’s grid emission factors published by 

Energy Market Authority and relevant conversion factors from the UK Government’s DEFRA (Department for 

Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs).

 Heeton Holdings Limited Sustainability Report FY2019 

Our total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions amounted to 6,788 tCO2e (tonnes of CO2 equivalent) in 

FY2019. This included 40% or 2,720 tCO2e of Scope 1 emissions4 that generated from natural gas 

consumption by our hotels, while 60% or 4,068 tCO2e represented Scope 2 emissions5  generated from 

our overall electricity consumption. Despite a lower amount of energy consumed compared to our UK 

operations, our activities in Singapore remained our largest emitters of GHG. This is due to a high 

proportion of fossil fuels used to produce Singapore’s grid electricity.  

GHG EMISSIONS (GLOBAL - FY2019) 

 

In FY2019, the average electricity intensity of our two investment properties in Singapore was 289.7 

kWh (1.0 GJ) per square meter (m2) of floor area, corresponding to an emission intensity of 0.12 

tCO2e/m2.  

WATER 

GRI 303-1, 303-2, 303-3 

Our investment properties and office headquarters in Singapore withdraw water from public networks 

and all used water is discharged back into the city’s sewerage system, where it is treated and recycled 

according to local regulations. No used water is discharged directly into the environment.  

In FY2019, our headquarters consumed 307 m3 of water, which represented only 0.3% of our Group’s 

total water consumption of 113,280 m3 during the year (108,792 m3 in FY2018) Due to their high retail 

activity, our two investment properties in Singapore used the largest amount of water, with 83,339 

m3 or 73.6% of the total. Comparatively, our six hotels in the UK consumed 29,633 m3, or 26.1% of the 

total, during the year.   

The water intensity of the investment properties was 2.91 m3 per m2 of floor area during the year.  

WATER USAGE (GLOBAL - FY2019) 

 

 

4 Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions of GHG produced from sources that are owned or controlled by an 

organisation. 

5 Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions of GHG produced from the consumption of purchased electricity.
