As the second Sustainability Report (the “report”) 

published by CDW, this report continues to disclose 

the policies, practices, targets and performances of 

the Group in terms of the material environmental, 

social and governmental factors that the Group has 

identified. The report aims at enabling all stakeholders 

to understand the progress and sustainability 

directions of the Group. It has been uploaded to the 

websites of SGX and CDW (www.cdw-holding.com.hk). 

REPORTING BOUNDARY

The report focuses on the operation of CDW’s 

business segment of LCD backlight units between 

January 2018 and December 2018 (the “reporting 

year”). The reporting boundary covers the 

manufacturing facility in Shanghai managed by Crystal 

Display Components (Shanghai) Co., Limited (the “CD 

Shanghai”), which is consistent with the reporting 

boundary in the Sustainability Report 2017. While the 

report does not fully cover the Group’s operations, 

CDW plans to consistently refine the internal data 

collection process and gradually expand the scope of 

disclosure in the coming reporting years. 

REPORTING STANDARD

The report is prepared in accordance with the ‘comply 

or explain’ provisions of SGX-ST Listing Rules 711A 

(“LR 711A”) on sustainability reporting, as well 

as the guidance set out in the Practice Note 7.6: 

Sustainability Reporting Guide (“PN 7.6”) issued by 

the SGX. The five reporting components prescribed by 

the SGX-ST Listing Rules 711B (“LR 711B”) underline 

the key structure of this report. It takes reference from 

the sustainability reporting framework provided by 

Global Reporting Initiatives (“GRI”), the GRI Standards 

(version 2016 and 2018). The disclosures in this report 

seeks to achieve the GRI’s Reporting Principles for 

defining report quality – accuracy, balance, clarity, 

comparability, reliability, and timeliness. 

To ensure the reporting quality and credibility, CDW 

commissioned a professional consultancy, Carbon 

Care Asia, to conduct stakeholder engagement, 

carbon assessment and report compilation. In addition

STATEmENT

While rapid innovation and reducing costs have 

increased access to digital products and technology, 

it also led to the ballooning of electronic and electrical 

waste. Each year, close to 50 million tonnes of 

e-waste is produced, making it the fastest growing 

waste stream. Notwithstanding e-waste’s detrimental 

nature to health and environment, proper handling 

and reduction of e-waste also present opportunities 

for harvesting valuable materials and building a more 

circular system in electronics industry.

Committed to advancing sustainability, the Group 

is aware of its role in reducing electronic waste and 

has adopted an open approach to reorganising its 

production processes. By simplifying the product 

design, valuable materials can be saved to lessen 

the burden on raw materials. This serves to lower the 

overall environmental impact of the entire value chain 

of our products.

The input of our stakeholders is essential to achieving 

our goals in relation to sustainability. We believe that 

operational success hinges on the maintenance of 

a regular dialogue with stakeholders. By engaging 

external sustainability consultancy, we have launched 

annual stakeholder engagement exercises and with the 

focus this year on factory staff based in Shanghai. With 

their feedback and consultancy analysis, we further 

refined the material focuses of sustainability issues. 

The results serve to guide us in formulating a more 

relevant sustainability strategy with timely response to 

stakeholders’ concern.

The Group is prepared to face uncertainties, risks 

and opportunities ahead, and has in place a risk 

management system to identify risks and prepare 

for mitigation measures. The future of automation 

technology can fundamentally change the business 

model of our industry. In response, the Group will 

continuously enhance employee training to keep 

abreast of emerging technologies and to ensure the 

safety and wellbeing of employees.

The Group is now preparing for the formal 

establishment for a sustainability committee with 

external expert advice. This new governance structure 

will be responsible for the formulation of sustainability 

policies and commitments and overseeing the 

implementation of strategies. We believe that this will 

allow us to engage in sustainability initiatives more 

effectively and thereby achieve better performance in 

environmental and social aspects.

The Audit Committee of CDW’s Board of Directors 

is responsible for overall sustainability management 

of the Group. In addition, the Information Security 

Committee of the Group is instituted to monitor the 

use of customer information and to protect customer 

privacy through its subsidiaries. In CD Shanghai, 

the General Manager has been coordinating the 

Environmental Management Committee to execute the 

environmental impact assessment, internal controls, 

environmental risk management, and operational 

planning. 

CD Shanghai’s operations have been accredited 

with ISO 9001 Quality Management and ISO 14001 

Environmental Management. Since a key product of 

CD Shanghai is supplied to assemble information 

display used in automobile, CD Shanghai operates in 

line with the requirements of International Automotive 

Task Force (IATF 16949: 2016 accredited). After 

reviewing CDW’s current policies, the Group is 

considering to subscribe to Core Conventions 

of International Labour Organization. The Group 

has commenced the planning of establishing a 

Sustainability Committee to cope with the emergent 

socio-environmental challenges.

CDW considers risk management as an integral part of daily management processes and good corporate governance. 

The Group’s Risk Management Policy sets out the way to respond to imminent risks in an efficient and responsible 

manner. The Group recognizes that risk management is the responsibility of everyone working at CDW. Taking into 

account the potential impacts of material sustainability topics on operation and strategic planning, the Group has 

identified some potential risks and opportunities with the support of external consultants.

Risks

Responses and Opportunities





















Talent attraction and retention

Hiring and retaining skilled employees is a challenge for 

manufacturing industry. Loss of skilled employees not 

only makes the operations vulnerable but it also affects 

the morale and confidence of internal stakeholders. 

CDW’s production facilities in China are located in 

areas where labour shortage is increasingly apparent. 

Employment System and Procedures

CDW recognises that fair employment system and 

practices, supported with learning and development 

opportunities are key pillars for engaging talents. 

The Group has devised annual plan on training and 

education in support of employee performance 

development. 

Product Responsibilities 

Considering the Group serves a selective range of key 

customers in its LCD backlight unit segment, prompt 

reaction to the changes in product specification from 

customers is of strategic importance. Any product 

defect or non-compliance issues may result in loss 

of customer trust. Meanwhile, since the Group relies 

on specific suppliers, it is the Group’s responsibility to 

assure technical capabilities of existing suppliers. 

Product Quality Assurance 

Apart from regulatory compliance, securing materials 

and supply-chain products of optimal quality are 

essential to operations. The Non-Conforming Product 

Control Procedure provides executional process of 

product assurance. Corrective and preventive actions 

will be undertaken, which include product rework, 

procedural optimisation and staff training. The Group 

is developing new products to cater for changing 

demands of the customers.

Customer Privacy

The Group collects personal data of customers and 

suppliers in its business activities. There is security risk 

in how businesses collect, handle, and store personal 

data given the rapid change of cyber technologies. Any 

loss or breach of customer privacy can result in not 

only financial loss but also non-financial damage. 

Data Protection Measures

The Group has implemented a number of measures to 

safeguard customer privacy, such as setting standards 

and providing guidance for employees to follow 

concerning editing, storage, modification and disposal 

of customer information.

Risks

Responses and Opportunities

















Climate Change

Greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions from manufacturing 

facilities pose risk to current and future operations of 

the Group in various geographic locations. Increasingly 

stringent local and international requirements in 

corporate carbon disclosures are affecting the climate 

readiness of the Group. 

Manufacture of LCD backlight unit is an energy-

intensive 

process. 

Fossil-fuel 

based 

energy 

consumption carries substantial carbon footprint. 

More frequent heat stress can reduce productivity and 

comfort level of employees in the working environment. 

Energy and Resource Efficiency 

The Group strives to enhance energy and resource 

efficiency and adopt new technologies to reduce the 

operating costs and GHG emission. The Environmental 

Management System has been deployed to monitor 

the emissions, consumption, and waste materials of 

the production facility. 

Alternative Energy Sources

The Group may benefit from opportunities offered by 

new types of energy supplies around the operation 

areas, and be able to utilise policy incentives for energy 

efficiency and renewable energy. 

Regional Water Stress/ Drought

Growing concern for global water stress is changing 

businesses’ 

behaviours 

towards 

responsible 

consumption of water. As the production units of CDW 

consume a significant amount of distilled water   during 

production, introduction of new policies such as water 

tariffs could be a key challenge to the Group. 

Water Management

To reduce pressure on freshwater resources in the 

surrounding communities, the Group has established 

procedures for recycling and reusing the withdrawn 

water. As part of the Environmental Management 

System of CD Shanghai, the Group actively monitors 

its water consumption..

Understanding and responding to the needs and ideas of stakeholders are key to achieving business sustainability and 

satisfactory outcomes for stakeholders. The Group’s stakeholders are those who are materially influencing or affected 

by the Group’s business. Stakeholders’ inputs lead the Group in shaping priorities and activities. 

The Group constantly engages its key internal and external stakeholders through multiple channels, for instance, direct 

mails, written reports, presentation, regular meetings, hotlines (e.g. whistleblowing hotlines), Annual General Meetings, 

and announcements on SGXNet. In response to the changing needs and demands from local regulatory agencies 

and community groups, the Group also regularly organizes meetings, seminars, community visits, study trips, and 

community service activities to engage these groups of external stakeholders.

MATERIALITY ANALYSIS

Stakeholders’ feedback guides the Group to review potential risks and opportunities and formulate corresponding 

sustainability strategy. CDW has engaged an external consultancy to conduct materiality assessment in the procedures 

shown below. Building upon the materiality analysis results of 2017 reporting, the assessment has identified the material 

topics for CDW and different stakeholder groups.

Product quality is closely tied with procurement practices and supply chain management. To closely monitor the 

performance of suppliers, CDW has established a supplier rating, reporting, and verification system. Suppliers are 

required to render production part approval process (PPAP) verification reports. Japan-based manufacturers remain to 

be the Group’s major suppliers due to the specific standard and high quality required by the Group’s customers.

Data privacy and data security are cornerstones of customer trust. It is the Group’s priority to safeguard customer 

privacy and information security. CDW has a set of measures designed to protect data that it handles across its 

operations. The Group’s provisional Information Security Policy underlines commitment and approach to protecting 

customer privacy.

In conjunction with the Information Security Policy, the Document Control Procedures and the Record Control 

Procedures of CD Shanghai clarify the appropriate conduct of employees in circumstances such as editing, storage, 

modification and disposal of customer specification documents. CD Shanghai’s Quality Manual sets out the standards 

of operations to prevent loss, damage or improper use of information of customers and external suppliers. In written 

contracts with customers, CD Shanghai pledges to exercise the duty of safeguarding customers’ confidential 

information and intellectual property rights, including business secrets and know-hows.

needs, evaluating market intelligence and feedback, as well as executing marketing plan. In the product development 

stage, CD Shanghai ensures effective communication with the customers to avoid misinformation.  

The Group abides by laws and regulations in relation to ethical operations, such as the Contract Law of the People’s 

Republic of China, the Trademark Law of the People’s Republic of China, and the Patent Law of the People’s Republic 

of China. During the reporting year, concerning product health and safety, information and labelling, as well as 

marketing and labelling, there were no cases of non-compliance with regulations or voluntary codes which resulted in a

Recognising the risks and opportunities presented to businesses and communities by climate change, CDW 

endeavours to reduce the environmental impacts of its operations. In line with applicable laws and regulations 

concerning environmental protection, CD Shanghai has articulated a host of policies and procedures, which set out 

the ways to minimising the impacts its activities brought to the surrounding environment and communities, and utilising 

resources in a responsible and efficient manner:

CARBON AND AIR EMISSIONS

Recognising that greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, or carbon emissions, have impending impacts on climate change 

and global warming, companies around the globe have been aligning their strategy and operations in reducing carbon 

footprint. 

To gain a better understanding of CD Shanghai’s carbon footprint, CDW engaged an external professional consultancy 

to quantify the GHG emissions from its operations in Shanghai through carbon assessment. The assessment was 

conducted with reference to international and local standards, including ISO 14064-1 and guidelines7 released by the 

National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) of the People’s Republic of China. It enables CDW to identify 

emissions hotspot, and develop carbon management strategy and actions.

In 2018, total GHG emissions of the Shanghai manufacturing facility were approximately 2,180 tonnes CO2-e. A 

slight increase of 8% was observed compared to 2017. It was mainly due to an increment of purchased electricity. 

The primary source of GHG emissions was Scope 2 energy indirect emissions which was mainly contributed by the 

generation of purchased electricity, accounting for nearly 89% of the total. 

8 The emission factors are chosen from the NDRC Guidelines, the average emission factor of East China Regional Grid and 

ICAO’s “Carbon Emissions Calculator” accordingly; and the source of the global warming potential (GWP) rates used is the Fifth

permit storage of chemicals, oil products and wastes near the sewage pipe network, or dumping of chemical wastes 

therein. Departments in production line shall not discharge industrial or domestic effluents into rainwater pipelines. 

Domestic effluents are discharged into municipal sewage treatment system. To closely monitor the quality of effluent 

discharge and ensure compliance, CD Shanghai commissioned a qualified third-party environmental testing agency 

to conduct annual testing at discharge points in accordance with the Environmental Monitoring and Measurement 

Management Procedures. 

11 There had been no changes in water storage in 2018.
