Occupational Health and Safety



It is fundamental that our workplaces are free of health and safety hazards. We encourage individual responsibility and good 

practices towards health and safety at all levels in Azeus as preventive measures at all our offices. Occupational health risks are 

identified to be a core threat to Azeus.

Azeus has taken steps to implement stringent policies and guidelines to strengthen health and safety standards within the 

organisation and to comply with the relevant laws and regulations in this area. 

A Safety Committee is set up by each of the offices in Hong Kong, the Philippines and the UK to coordinate, implement and administer 

the safety and health programs for Azeus. The Safety Committee also conducts an annual risk assessment to identify potential 

workplace safety and health risks, and to take preventive measures against them. The Safety Committee reviews safety standards, 

systems and performances periodically and is responsible to implement major decisions, policies and safety and health procedures. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and global lockdown measures occurring towards the end of FY2020, our Business Continuity 

Plan was quickly activated and is continuously monitored and responded as the situation requires. 

Employees can report any health and safety incidences to the HR or Administration Departments. 

HK Office



The Health and Safety Policy for the HK office embraces healthy working conditions, and aims to provide adequate control of 

risks arising from work activities. All of the Management and the employees of Azues HK must read and observe the Occupational 

and Health Ordinance under the laws of Hong Kong, in particular the Occupational Safety and Health (Display Screen Equipment) 

Regulations. The Group had previously identified prolonged use of display screen equipment as a major risk of occupational hazards 

and injuries in the HK office. With robust policies and regulations in place, there were no reports of any complaints from any 

prolonged use of display screen equipment in the FY2020.

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the HK Office has implemented precautionary measures to reduce the risk of the virus spreading 

in its office. 

Philippines Office



Azeus Philippines established a Policy and Program of Safety and Health to protect employees from workplace injuries. In FY2020, 

Azeus Philippines identified several  major safety risks for the Philippines office which included risks from volcanic eruptions, 

earthquake, fire and typhoon. Azeus Philippines held an Emergency Preparedness Workshop in December 2019 to raise awareness 

on these safety risks. Additional measures and efforts were taken to prepare the Philippines office from any unexpected emergencies 

that may require safe evacuation from the office. Other similar workshops that were scheduled in the FY2020, have been postponed 

due to COVID-19. 

As part of the COVID-19 preparedness, the Philippines office had implemented measures to minimise risk of employee exposure to 

COVID-19 once its employees returned to the office gradually. 

UK Office



Azeus UK implemented the Health and Safety Policy, which aims to create a safe working environment for employees working alone 

and provides guidance on managing risks related to health and safety. The Directors of Azeus UK have overall and final responsibility 

for health and safety of the UK office. 

Over the last two years, the Group did not experience any incidences of fatalities by work-related injury, high-consequence work-

related injuries, recordable work-related injuries, fatalities caused by work-related ill health, and recordable work-related ill health.

Employee Grievance Mechanism



Our employee grievance process provides our employees a formal avenue to raise their concerns on any complaints, difficulties or 

unlawful discrimination or harassment in confidence to the relevant HR directors in their local offices. Where such grievances may 

concern their normal line of supervision or management, an employee may approach the relevant Group employee. Employees 

also have the right to pursue complaints of discrimination to an industrial tribunal or the Fair Employment Tribunal under the anti-

discrimination legislation in the country where the employees concerned are hired. 

Local Communities 



Azeus is committed to go beyond our operations and extend our social responsibility to communities where we operate in. We 

support various initiatives that we believe support and will build a stronger community. 

Azeus provides support to the Group’s employees when they volunteer in or sponsor community events. The employees are entitled 

to take sabbatical leave, financial allowances or stipends, for activities such as teaching in Universities. 

We believe in community investments to various programmes to support these initiatives.

Anti-Corruption and Bribery



Azeus HK’s Code of Conduct outlines business conduct and the ethical standards that employees are required to adhere to in 

their day-to-day work. The Code of Conduct is instilled in all new employees and stressed that anti-bribery laws prohibit the 

giving or taking of gifts or bribes, the making of facilitation payments or the giving or receiving of favours. All of the Azeus HK

Azeus UK has also established its own Code of Conduct for all of its employees to comply and ensure that they perform their 

duties with integrity, commitment and professionalism. In addition, Azeus UK has in place the Anti-Bribery Policy as part of its 

commitment to maintain high standards of ethical and integrity in its business activities in the UK and overseas in accordance

The employees of Azeus Philippines are also guided by its Code of Conduct to perform their duties with integrity, commitment 

and professionalism. This Code of Conduct is in place amongst others, for the prevention of bribery, misuse of proprietary 

information, assets and resources or give rise to any potential conflict of interest by any of the Azeus Philippines employees. 

Additionally, the Internal Fraud Policy established by  Azeus Philippines set out measures for the detection and prevention of 

fraud that might occur in its office. Internal controls such as proper inventory management and procurement practices as well 

as ensuring adequate signatories on bank transactions up to a certain limit provide safeguards to detect any irregular activity 

involving any Azeus Philippines’ employee, regardless of position/title or length of service.

In the FY2020, we did not receive any reports or incidents on anti-corruption within the Group. Any reported incidents will be 

viewed seriously and necessary action to be taken, as required.

We will continue to uphold the highest standard of integrity and transparency in our conduct of business and continue to take 

measures towards a clean and corruption free environment.

As part of Azeus’ risk management to collect, handle and store customer and other stakeholder’s information, Azeus has 

established procedures to safeguard confidential information, such as the Code of Conduct and the Information Classification 

Policy. 

The Code of Conduct for each of the offices provides that all confidential information, personal data, commercially sensitive

Economic Performance 



The overall economic performance and profitability of the 

Group is one of Azeus’ core concerns. Many of our stakeholders 

which includes our shareholders, investors, employees and 

suppliers, rely on our economic performance.

 

We monitor our economic performance through our budgeting 

process. The budget is set annually, reviewed throughout the 

financial year to monitor whether targets are met and what 

actions can be taken up to achieve the same. To evaluate 

our economic performance, internal and external audits are 

conducted on a regular basis.

The following tables provide an overview of the economic 

performance of the business segments over the last 2 

reporting  years:

Professional IT Services



Azeus strives to achieve sustainable economic excellence while embracing responsible business practices across our operations and supply 

chain. 

During the FY2020, the Group recorded a total revenue of 

HK$181.2 million, while profit after tax amounted to HK$12.7 

million, which is a 22% increase from the HK$147.8 million 

reported in the FY2019 The higher total revenue achieved in 

FY2020 was mainly from the increased sales of the “Azeus 

Convene” and “AzeusCare” products, and its associated 

professional services as well as the higher sale of third-party 

hardware and software upon the delivery and acceptance of 

an implementation project completed during FY2020. The 

Azeus Products segment surged 68.1% to HK$83.9 million in 

FY2020 from HK$49.9 million in FY2019.

There was no significant change to the organisation and our 

supply chain in the reporting year.

AGM@Convene 



Given the difficulties faced by listed companies in organising AGMs once the COVID-19 restrictions came into effect, Azeus launched 

its brand new e-AGM product in April 2020 for listed companies to hold AGMs in a manner that is compliant with the current 

health and safety regulations and practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Stock exchanges and regulatory authorities have 

recently issued guidelines and changes to rules and regulations to facilitate AGMs to be conducted in a compliant manner during this 

period. This product allows not only shareholders and listed companies themselves to participate but other parties involved without 

breaching any quarantine or social distancing restrictions.

In the month of June 2020, Azeus ran virtual AGMs for some 60 customers comprising listed companies, enterprises, business 

associations and non-profit organisations. Riding on the strong reception for its end-to-end e-AGM solution in Singapore, Azeus has 

started to market internationally, adding customers from the Philippines and Hong Kong. As this product is new in the market, its 

contribution is still low. Demand of the product will likely grow given the new trend towards e-AGMs in the ‘new normal’ environment.

ENVIRONMENT



Azeus is committed to contribute to the global goals ofminimising the environmental impact and ensure compliance with environmental 

legislations by efficiently using and conserving available resources across our business operations. We aim to continuously improve our 

environmental performance through application of international standards and best practices.

Azeus HK and Azeus UK have separate Azeus Environmental Policies for their offices to promote sound practices on environmental 

protection within all departments across their operations. Several environmental initiatives have been introduced in both offices 

addressing recycling, waste reduction, reduction of energy consumption and natural resources and reduction of carbon footprint. All 

employees and contractors of Azeus HK and Azeus UK are expected to comply with the Azeus Environmental Policy that is reviewed on 

an annual basis. 

Azeus recognises that any change in climate such as extreme weather change in today’s environment, may have an impact on the 

Group’s ability to access resources and sustain operations. In order to mitigate environmental related risks that may impact Azeus, 

Azeus HK implemented the Environmental Management System (EMS) in 2018 to comply with the ISO 14001:2015 standards. The EMS 

is a systematic process developed to identify and address non-conformities, environmental accidents, and incidents through both 

corrective actions and preventive measures to minimise impact to the environment and the potential for reoccurrence. The EMS also 

handles enquiries, complaints (both internal and external) and nonconformities of the EMS. All practices to manage environmental 

impacts on office activities of Azeus HK are set out in the Environmental Instruction – Environmental Office Practices. As part of Azeus 

HK’s commitment to the ISO 14001:2015 standards, all suppliers and contractors are required to observe the requirements under the 

Environmental Guidance Notes when dealing with the Group. 

The Azeus Environmental Policy and the Azeus Environmental Guidance Notes for the HK office are published on our website,

www.azeus.com.

The HK office provides routine environmental training programmes for new employees as part of their onboarding orientation to 

encourage its employees to be mindful of the conservation efforts carried out by Azeus HK. Additional training will be arranged for the 

existing employees if there are any new or major changes made to the policies, regulations or guidelines. Our Environment Management 

Representative (EMR) based in the HK Office, monitors and evaluates the EMS to ensure that our employees, suppliers and contractors 

align their activities with these standards. The Environmental Management System Committee, is a working group set-up in the HK 

office to manage of the ISO 14001:2015 matters.

Use of Resources



            Water



Water is an essential component of our ecosystem. At Azeus, we take our responsibility towards managing and working towards 

reducing our water consumption across our operations seriously although our water consumption is relatively low as compared to 

other industries.

In our previous Report, Azeus reported that the Group has undertaken a series of water reduction initiatives to manage the use of 

water in our building operations. 

Examples of initiatives that the Group has implemented since the previous reporting years are: 

• 

Regularly checking pipes and taps for leakage

• 

Repair immediately any pipe leakage detected

• 

Regularly monitoring water consumption

• 

Adopting water efficient appliances

• 

Placing signages at strategic locations in the offices to conserve water

The table below sets out the raw water consumption of our key offices over the last 3 reporting years:

ENVIRONMENT

            Energy



We believe that investing our time towards energy efficiency will not only provide a positive influence on our environment but also 

help reduce our energy costs in the long-term. 

To achieve our target for FY2020, Azeus continues to develop and implement new energy conservation initiatives for the Group. 

We identified the new ways to improve energy consumption for the Philippines office. These initiatives include replacement of 

fluorescent lights with LED system throughout the Philippines office commencing from June 2019 and replacement of some office 

appliances to energy saving models. The HK office successfully managed to reduce electricity consumption by 16% in FY2020 as 

compared to the FY2019, achieving the FY2020 1% target rate.

Below is an overview of the various responsible energy conservation initiatives that Azeus has adopted: 











Electrical appliances

• 

Switching off the idle office 

equipment (e.g. monitors, 

computers, printer and 

photocopiers) when they are 

not in use

• 

Setting appliances to energy 

saving mode, where possible

Air-conditioning

• 

Ensuring that external doors 

are closed to conserve 

internal heat/cold

•

Greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions contribute to climate change. Azeus is committed to further reduce our emissions as part of our 

social responsibility to support global efforts on climate change.

Azeus has conducted a carbon assessment on its operations based on GHG protocol guidelines relevant in the respective jurisdictions. 

For consistency, Azeus will annually assess, record and disclose our GHG emissions in order to improve our emissions reduction 

targets. 

To achieve the FY2020 targets on GHG emissions, Azeus continues to explore different ways to improve its data collection system 

and prioritise actions for reduction of GHG emissions. The HK office utilised the carbon audit excel template provided by the HK 

Environmental Protection Department to collect the required data on GHG emissions.
