HAI LECK HOLDINGS LIMITED 

2018 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 

CEO’S STATEMENT 

 

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS, 

 

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Hai Leck 

Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries (the 

“Group”), I am pleased to present our 

inaugural sustainability report for the financial 

year ended 30 June 2018 (“FY2018”). 

 

We appreciate that measurement of success 

and sustainability extends beyond the Group’s 

financial 

results, 

but 

encompasses 

non-

financial considerations such as the Group’s 

ability to contribute to the society and 

environment. 

 

Accordingly, 

we 

have 

identified 

several 

material environmental, social and governance 

(“ESG”) 

factors 

that 

are 

key 

to 

the 

sustainability of the Group’s operations. The 

identification of these factors is a testament to 

our commitment to not only continue to ensure 

the Group’s financial success and welfare of 

our employees, but to be a good and socially 

responsible corporate citizen as well. 

 

In 

the 

Group’s 

long 

history, 

we 

have 

consistently placed emphasis on continuous 

improvement in productivity. Whilst focusing 

on getting the work done productively, we do 

not overlook the importance of the safety of 

our workers. Workplace safety is of paramount 

importance to us: the Group has zero 

tolerance 

where 

workplace 

safety 

is 

concerned and this is deeply ingrained into our 

corporate culture. More will be shared in the 

following sections regarding the Group’s focus 

on the material ESG factors identified and the 

outcome of our initiatives in FY2018. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to 

thank all our stakeholders: shareholders, 

customers, employees, suppliers, bankers and 

business partners for the support given 

through the years. The Group looks forward to 

being able to contribute to the well-being of all 

stakeholders for many years to come. 

 

 

Cheng Yao Tong 

Chief Executive Officer

2018 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

 

Workplace safety is of paramount importance 

to us. The Group has zero tolerance where 

workplace safety is concerned. 

 

Our target is to maintain a zero accident 

workplace. To that end, we have implemented 

a 

robust 

workplace 

safety 

and 

health 

management system that is BS OHSAS 18001 

compliant and certified to have attained 

bizSAFE Level Star which is the highest 

certification level accorded by the Workplace 

Safety and Health (“WSH”) Council. 

 

 

 

We believe that everyone is responsible for 

their own safety and the safety of others. 

Therefore, each new hire’s safety journey with 

the Group starts with the necessary safety 

induction courses tailored to their respective 

scope of work, during which workplace 

hazards and at-risk areas are highlighted. 

They are also issued with standard personal 

protective equipment as well as specialised 

safety equipment suited to their nature of work. 

External training courses and all medical 

examinations required under the Workplace 

Safety and Health Act are carried out by 

qualified service providers. 

 

Recent accidents in the industry or near 

misses are periodically shared as learning 

points and to serve as reminder of the 

importance of safety at our workplace. Best 

safety practices are regularly shared in order 

to 

continuously 

improve 

on 

our 

safety 

standards. We also regularly conduct safety 

campaigns or actively participate in campaigns 

organised by our customers. 

 

In fact, safety is so deeply ingrained into our 

corporate culture that compliance with the 

Group’s 

safety 

requirements 

and 

safety 

awareness form part of our performance 

appraisal. 

 

Our safety performance record for FY2018 

and the financial year ended 30 June 2017 

(“FY2017”) are as shown below:

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 

 

Our people are one of the most important and 

valuable 

resources 

to 

us. 

To 

ensure 

successful execution of our work, we need 

employees with a wide range of experiences 

and qualifications, who will bring different 

perspectives with them. 

 

Hence, the Group advocates equal opportunity, 

as well as racial, gender and age diversity. 

Employment and promotion are based on 

merit, regardless of their gender, race, age, 

religion and marital status. 

 

Our employee profiles by gender, age and 

nationality 

as 

well 

as 

ratio 

of 

basic 

remuneration of women to men are presented 

below: 

 

 

Note: Site personnel are almost exclusively men due to 

the physically demanding nature of the work involved. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As part of our initiatives to embrace diversity, 

the Group pledged it support to SPD (formerly 

known as the Society for the Physically 

Disabled) and participated in SPD’s annual 

Charity Walk.

WASTE MANAGEMENT 

 

We dispose of waste in a safe and 

environmentally sound manner in accordance 

with local regulations. 

 

The waste generated by our operations are 

categorized 

into 

hazardous 

and 

non-

hazardous waste. Due to its potential impact 

on the environment and persons who come 

into contact with them, waste disposal, 

particularly 

hazardous 

waste, 

is 

taken 

seriously. All wastes are collected by licensed 

waste collector to ensure proper transportation 

and disposal. 

 

The amount of waste generated is a function 

of the level of activities during the year. 

Nonetheless, the Group is careful not to 

procure excess raw materials with limited shelf 

life that may eventually end up as waste. 

 

The 

quantities 

of 

hazardous 

and 

non-

hazardous waste disposed in FY2018 and 

FY2017 are as shown below: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Our target is to have no violation of local 

regulations. There were no violations in 

FY2018.
