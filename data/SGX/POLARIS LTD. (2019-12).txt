LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

Dear Valued Shareholders,  

 

On behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to 

report that Polaris Ltd (the “Company”, and together 

with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) achieved a profit of 

S$0.2 million for the financial year ended 31 

December 2019 (“FY2019”) – a resilient performance 

despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. 

 

DEVELOPMENTS IN FY2019  

 

The Singapore economy grew by 0.7% in 2019 (as 

compared to 3.1% in 2018), the slowest in a decade 

amid prolonged global trade conflicts and tepid 

business sentiment.  Nevertheless, the Group’s new 

management team continued to forge ahead by 

streamlining business operations and expanding each 

division’s suite of product and service offerings.  

 

Our distribution division delivered strong growth by 

working closely with our business partners to secure 

more 

contracts 

and 

a 

larger 

share 

of 

their  

procurements. 

 

Our retail consumer electronics division also saw 

growth with a more comprehensive product and 

service offering for our customers. Our participation in 

the Apple Device Enrollment Program (“DEP”) 

facilitates easier deployment and configuration of 

devices and this allows us to better serve our 

corporate clients. While the retail sector remains 

challenging, the division managed to bolster its 

performance through higher accessory attachment 

rates 

coupled 

by 

stronger 

device 

sales. 

Our 

educational robotics portfolio and customer base 

strengthened, positioning us well in the rapidly 

evolving and expanding educational sector. 

 

In addition, our customer service teams rose to the 

challenge to substantially expand our capacity and 

sharpen service quality standards. Both the qualitative 

and quantitative results were impressive. We are 

proud of our achievements to deliver premium service 

at scale. 

 

Notwithstanding the current operating environment, 

we remain committed to pursue new business 

opportunities to drive sustainable growth and enhance 

shareholder value. After reviewing several business 

opportunities over the two past years, we proceeded 

to enter the resale space and established a joint 

venture in Singapore, Marque Luxury Asia Pte Ltd, in 

the fourth quarter of 2019. The business is focused on 

developing the wholesale and retail of premium 

lifestyle products. 

 

 

On the regional front, Polaristitans Philippines Inc. 

remained stable and continued to focus on sound 

account and fiscal management, accurate product 

forecasting and tight inventory management. The 

team continues to pursue opportunities with key 

reliable resellers and corporate accounts. 

 

 

FINANCIAL REVIEW  

 

The Group posted revenue of S$54.4 million for the 

financial year ended 31 December 2019 (“FY2019”) 

compared to S$23.1 million in the previous financial 

year ended 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”). All 

business units posted growth year on year. The Group 

recorded profit attributable to shareholders of S$0.2 

million for FY2019, on par with the profit of S$0.2 

million in FY2018. The result in FY2018 was 

supported by the gain on disposal of Polaris Telecom 

Pte Ltd. Profitability in FY2019 was achieved from 

improved business performance and a reduction in 

operating costs. Net assets decreased significantly 

from S$60.5 million in FY2018 to S$14.3 million in 

FY2019. This was mainly due to the impairment of the 

Group’s 8.22% stake in PT Trikomsel Oke Tbk, as the 

shares were suspended from trading on the Indonesia 

Stock Exchange in FY2019. 

 

CORPORATE 

SOCIAL 

RESPONSIBILITY 

AND 

SUSTAINABILITY 

 

Polaris continues to actively contribute and support 

the communities in which we live and work. This year, 

our employees were pleased to continue our 

commitment to serve by volunteering at the Willing 

Hearts soup kitchen in October 2019. 

 

Apart from a handful of staff, Willing Hearts is wholly 

run by volunteers. It operates a soup kitchen that 

prepares, cooks and distributes about 5,000 daily 

meals to over 40 locations island wide throughout the 

year. Beneficiaries include the elderly, the disabled, 

low income families, children from single parent 

families or otherwise poverty-stricken families, and 

migrant workers in Singapore. 

 

We are grateful to do our part to serve and contribute 

to our society so as to improve the lives of others.  

 

Embracing sustainability is integral to the long-term 

development and growth of our business. For more 

information on our sustainability efforts, performance 

and strategies in FY2019, please refer to the 

Sustainability Report on pages 10 to 20.

LOOKING AHEAD 

 

Our retail and customer service businesses continue 

to see both opportunities and risks. We work closely 

with several leading brands which are performing 

well and Polaris is in a position to benefit from their 

growth. At the same time, these companies 

continually review the strategies and terms with 

which they engage their partners, which may affect 

our businesses both positively and negatively over 

time. We will continue to invest in our people and 

these businesses to ensure that we remain as a 

valuable and preferred partner. As in 2019, we will 

explore adding new higher margin products and 

services to our business portfolio. With our position 

in educational robotics established and Singapore’s 

growing private and public investments in the 

disciplines of science, technology, engineering and 

mathematics (“STEM”), we hope that our portfolio 

will expand to address growing customer demand. 

 

Having entered the resale space in late 2019, we are 

in the early stages of establishing this business and 

developing the opportunities we see here. These 

include expanding our sourcing footprint and 

investing in our own technology platforms to ensure 

that we optimally leverage on the valuable data that 

we are collecting.  

 

Going into 2020, the Group is well positioned to 

manage our existing businesses as well as explore 

new ones. The work ahead is focused on taking on a 

manageable level of risk that allows us to drive 

sustainable growth and enhance shareholder value. 

 

WORDS OF APPRECIATION  

 

We would like to start by appreciating our valued 

employees for going the extra mile in 2019. Without 

their extensive efforts, our improved performance 

would never have been possible. To Mr Ong Soon 

Hwee, Gary, who stepped down as Executive 

Director and Chief Operating Officer, we offer our 

heartfelt thanks for his many contributions to the 

Company. To all of our shareholders, customers and 

business partners we extend our warm appreciation 

for your continued support. Finally, we would like to 

thank our management team and fellow board 

members for their dedication and guidance. We look 

forward to make 2020 another successful year 

together.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 

 10	

 

INTRODUCTION 

 

Polaris is pleased to present its third annual Sustainability Report. The report captures Polaris’s sustainability 

effort, performance and strategies over the financial year ended 31 December 2019 (“FY2019”). This report 

includes the environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) performance for our business operations in 

Singapore and excludes overseas operations unless stated otherwise.  

 

This report has been prepared in accordance with the latest Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Sustainability 

Reporting Guidelines: Core options. We have chosen GRI as the sustainability reporting framework as it is 

internationally recognized and widely adopted, enabling us to disclose our ESG performance in a comprehensive 

and comparable manner. The GRI Content Index and the relevant references are provided on pages 19 to 20 of 

the report. Information presented in this report has been extracted from primary internal records and documents 

to ensure accuracy. The Board of Directors of the Group (the “Board” or “Directors”) oversees the management 

and monitoring of the Group’s strategic direction, its policies and material ESG factors.  

 

REPORTING PRINCIPLES  

 

We have followed the GRI principles for defining the sustainability report content and quality. We have prepared 

the report having considered stakeholder inclusiveness, Polaris’s sustainability context, materiality and 

completeness. To ensure quality of the report, we have applied the GRI principles of accuracy, balance, clarity, 

comparability, reliability and timeliness in preparing this report.  

 

REPORTING PROCESS  

 

Polaris’s Sustainability Committee (the “Committee”), which includes key members of management and 

executive directors, provides the overall major direction for preparing the report. The Committee’s responsibilities 

include reviewing, assessing and determining the sustainability context, material ESG topics, report content and

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

 

At Polaris, we develop our sustainability strategy by gathering stakeholder feedback on issues that are material to 

them and our business. We have identified our stakeholders based on importance, responsibility, dependency 

and proximity. We view stakeholder engagement as a continual process and not a one-off event. We adopt both 

formal and informal channels of communication to understand the needs of key stakeholders, and incorporate 

these into our corporate strategies to achieve mutually beneficial relationships. 

 

We continuously seek to improve communication with our stakeholders and consider their inputs and feedback in 

our business strategy. This helps us to develop better trust and understanding with our stakeholders and 

strengthens our partnership as well. As a result of such communication and engagement with our stakeholders, 

we have identified their respective key concerns as detailed below.

OUR MATERIALITY TOPICS 

 

We have identified material topics for reporting based on the significance of our ESG and economic impacts, the 

risks and opportunities involved, and the degree of influence where we see the most potential for creating 

maximum value for our shareholders and stakeholders. In order to ensure an accurate determination of material 

issues, we undertook a process of identification, prioritisation and validation with our management team. We are 

also working on our risk assessment policy in respect of our sustainability strategies and operations, and are 

considering various options to improve in our efforts to develop a more comprehensive policy going forward. 

 

Each sustainability factor is assigned a reporting priority that determines the actions required, as illustrated 

below:

OUR ENVIRONMENTAL EFFORTS 

 

Carbon Emissions 

 

We believe in progressively reducing our organization’s carbon footprint by improving energy efficiency and 

minimising energy consumption. Polaris’s greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emission is attributed to the use of electricity, 

diesel and petrol. In FY2019, our emission intensity was calculated at 0.0023 tonnes CO2e per onsite repair – the 

same as in the preceding year. 

 

Energy Efficiency 

 

Our management approach is to conserve energy consumption in our daily operations. Electricity that is used to 

power our office buildings and retail outlets has contributed to the majority of our energy consumption. Other 

notable consumption components include petroleum or diesel that is used for transportation and logistics. 

 

Compared to FY2018, our total energy consumption in FY2019 has dropped by 8.1%. A comparison chart in 

respect of our energy consumption for FY2018 and FY2019 is depicted in Figure 1 as shown below: 

 

 

 

Waste Minimisation 

 

Our management approach is to reduce, reuse and recycle waste wherever possible throughout our daily 

operations. Waste from our operations includes paper and packaging waste. Over the years, Polaris has 

implemented several other initiatives to reduce printed marketing materials. For instance, we have switched to 

sending e-cards during festive seasons from the conventional printed greeting cards. Empty ink cartridges are 

consolidated and returned to suppliers on a bimonthly basis. Packaging waste is also consolidated and recycled 

on a weekly basis. 

 

Continuing from FY2018, we have expanded our recycling process for Dyson parts. Recycling greatly reduces 

the emission of many greenhouse gases and water pollution, which are often by-products of waste disposal and 

destruction, and saves energy. The faulty parts, which consist of Printer Circuit Boards (PCBs), motors and 

electrical cables extracted from fans and vacuums, are consolidated on a monthly basis and recycled by 

separating them into e-waste, plastics and metal from general waste daily.  

 

With this process, it helps to reduce the pollution otherwise caused by the extraction and processing of virgin 

materials. Also, when products are made using recycled rather than virgin materials, less energy is used during 

manufacturing, and fewer pollutants are emitted. 

 

We also practice the proper disposal of waste by separating the faulty parts (which cannot be recycled 

meaningfully) and having them disposed of by a credible disposal company. All disposals will be completed with 

a certificate of destruction issued by the said disposal company.

OUR WORKPLACE (SOCIAL) 

 

Polaris practices fair employment and is aligned with the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment guidelines. Our 

human resource policies are aimed at providing a fair performance-based work culture that is diverse, inclusive 

and collaborative. We also encourage our people to reach their fullest potential and provide them with a fulfilling 

and meaningful career. 

 

As at 31 December 2019, our workforce consists of 49 employees. Permanent employees represented 94% of 

the total headcount. Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents (“PRs”) are the top priority during the 

employee selection process. With reference to the performance highlights on page 11, the percentage of local 

employees (Singapore citizens and PRs) employed by us has increased from 83% to 86% between FY2018 and 

FY2019. In terms of the gender diversity of our workforce as of December 2019, 59% of the workforce was male, 

while the remaining 41% was female. Employees with managerial or supervisory roles accounted for 22% of our 

workforce.  

 

Talent Attraction and Retention 

 

We believe investing in our people is crucial to the success of a business. We manage our human capital 

investment by attracting and nurturing the right talent, as well as caring for their professional growth and personal 

well-being during their employment with us. This can be attested by Polaris’s low staff attrition rate. 

 

In addition, we continue to leverage our partnership with the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) to support 

work-study programmes, providing traineeship opportunities to students as part of their course modules. This 

programme is designed to prepare students for the future workforce by equipping them with employable, real-

world skills and experiences, whilst allowing them to complete their studies.  

 

Polaris conducts annual performance appraisals and quarterly career development reviews for our employees as 

part of the performance management system. Managers are equipped with relevant skills to conduct effective 

performance appraisals with their teams.  

 

Training and Education 

 

With the rapid changes in our industry, it is important for our people to keep updated on the latest industry 

developments. At Polaris, we encourage and aim to provide all employees with equal opportunities for training 

and upgrading. We believe that learning and training is an important, continuous and life-long process so that 

employees are equipped with the competencies needed to meet current and future business needs. This includes 

workshops, seminars, conference, in-house company training and on-the-job training.  

 

In FY2019, we arranged a number of courses and training opportunities to enhance productivity and adherence 

to quality standards. Through this, we believe that our employees are able to develop skill sets that allow them to 

undertake a greater variety of work and are better able to implement and realise specific goals outlined in a 

company's business plan. Internally, we conduct a Microsoft Excel 2016 Basix course for the benefit of our retail 

employees to boost their productivity and improve quality of work. External courses include training in Wordpress 

Essential Training, Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. These external courses are mainly arranged for our 

sales and marketing teams to better enable them to create professional business websites and design marketing 

collaterals and professional ads.  

 

With a renewed focus on training opportunities in FY2019, it was only appropriate that we raised “training and 

education”, as an ESG issue, to one of “high” priority as compared to 2018 when it was regarded as “medium” 

priority. We strongly believe that it is important to continuously provide our employees with the correct training. 

This, in return, allows the business to be cost-effective, increasing credibility and expertise, as well as improving 

job satisfaction, and creates a competitive edge in the market. 

 

Diversity and Equal Opportunity 

 

We believe that creating a diverse workplace environment is essential to building and sustaining our competitive 

advantage. Such diversity fosters innovative thinking and helps tackle business challenges through different 

perspectives. 

 

Moreover, we strive to offer equal opportunities in hiring, career advancements, promotions and remuneration 

based on merit and experience irrespective of gender, age, racial, ethnic or cultural background. Female 

employees account for 41% of our total workforce. 

 

Marketing and Labelling 

 

Polaris recognises that fair marketing practices and being transparent in the way we communicate can build trust 

and loyalty among our customers, partners and suppliers. We adhere to strict marketing codes to ensure that all 

marketing activities comply with the various laws and guidelines such as the Singapore Code of Advertising 


17

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 

 17	

Practice, the Info-communications Media Development Authority’s Codes of Practice and Guidelines, and the 

PDPA. 

 

In FY2019, we have not identified any non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary codes concerning 

information and labelling, or marketing communications including advertising, promotion and sponsorships in 

relation to products and services that we offer.  

 

Moving forward, we strive to maintain the quality of our products and services as well as retail and distribution 

channels by choosing the right type of products and services to fit our business model. Quality checks will also be 

continuously deployed by our staff to ensure compliance with applicable regulations relating to marketing and 

labelling in the markets we operate. 

 

Community Development and Employee Volunteering 

 

We encourage our employees to participate in community and environmental initiatives through volunteering, and 

supported several community initiatives throughout the year. We are grateful to do our part to serve and 

contribute to our society so as to improve the lives of others. Our key community involvement programme in 2019 

is described below.  

 

Willing Hearts 

 

We were given an opportunity to volunteer at Willing Hearts for a day, where we prepared and delivered meals to 

the beneficiaries. Willing Hearts is a non-profit organization ran almost entirely by volunteers, apart from a 

handful of staff. It operates a soup kitchen that prepares, cooks and distributes about 5,000 daily meals to over 

40 locations island wide, 365 days a year. Beneficiaries include the elderly, disabled, low income families, 

children from single parent families or otherwise poverty-stricken families, and migrant workers in Singapore. 

 

OUR ECONOMY 

 

Our management approach is to create value for our shareholders and stakeholders by ensuring sustainable 

growth for our business. We are focused on adopting strategies that maximise shareholder returns while creating 

environmental, social and economic value for our stakeholders. In 2019, the company entered the resale space 

of premium lifestyle products, riding the global trend of increased interest in used products. 

 

We regularly review our management approach in view of the business goals, stakeholder expectations and the 

actual performance to evaluate effectiveness. 

 

Anti-Corruption  

 

Polaris adheres to a zero-tolerance policy on fraud and unethical conduct including corruption and bribery. A 

whistle-blowing process is in place and supported. There was no reported incident of corruption in the reporting 

period. For more information on the whistle-blowing process, please refer to our Whistle-Blowing Policy as 

described in the Corporate Governance section on page 34. 

 

Board Diversity 

 

The Board recognises that board diversity is an important element which will better support the Company’s 

achievement of its strategic objectives for sustainable development by enhancing the decision-making process of 

the Board through varied perspectives, skills, experience, gender, age, knowledge and professional 

qualifications. 

 

Risk Management and Internal Controls 

 

The Company’s internal auditors conduct an annual review of the effectiveness of the Company’s material 

internal controls, including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls, and a risk 

assessment at least annually to ensure the adequacy of the same.  

 

Procurement Practices 

 

Polaris adopts a fair business trading framework and procures from suppliers who conduct business ethically. 

 

With the extensive varieties and range of products to procure from different sectors of suppliers, we have 

stringent procurement processes in place to ensure good corporate governance and compliance with anti-bribery 

and corruption rules and regulations. Our multi-tiered approval process ensures that each level of approval will 

take into consideration the suppliers’ capabilities, consistency, product quality, reliability and price to ensure that 

we are operating within high ethical standards.

Our procured products and supplies are from brands which the business units are representing, such as Apple, 

Dyson and MakeBlock, and other suppliers for products such as computer accessories, lifestyle and audio 

devices.  

 

We encourage and support local business. In FY2019, our total purchase spending was approximately S$36.2 

million, an increase of 72.38% from the preceding year. Out of our 117 vendors, only one was from overseas 

import as we represent the brand as its distributor in Singapore. The overseas vendor comprised 0.85% of our 

total purchases. 

 

We work actively to combat corruption in all of its forms, which include bribery, unfair competition, conflicts of 

interest, fraud, embezzlement and unlawful kickbacks. Our senior management lead by example and aim to 

foster a workplace culture with zero-tolerance for bribery, fraud, embezzlement and unlawful kickbacks. In 

addition, our HR department is tasked with overseeing the policy because they are aware of relevant employee-

related legislation in terms of unfair competition and conflicts of interest. Relevant details are highlighted in the 

letter of appointment for new employees. 

 

All procurement is processed through our Enterprise Resource Planning system with its multi-tiered approval 

process, whereby up to three levels of approving officers are required to approve and sign off on the issuing of 

Purchase Orders in the system. This is to address conflicts of interest and ensure the correct latest purchase 

price, as illustrated in the diagram, below. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As an integral part of supply chain management, we diligently sort out the delivered goods packaging and ensure 

that they are disposed of in an environmentally-responsible manner. 

 

We also continually look at improving our warehousing and storage spaces to ensure better workplace safety and 

health.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

 21	

The Board of Directors (the “Board” or “Directors”) of Polaris Ltd. (the “Company” and together with its 

subsidiaries, the “Group”) are fully committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and 

recognises the importance of good corporate governance and the offering of high standards of accountability to 

shareholders. 

 

This report outlines the Company’s corporate governance processes and activities with specific reference made 

to each of the principles and provisions of the Code of Corporate Governance (the “2018 Code”) issued on 6 

August 2018 as applied to annual reports of issuers listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited 

(the “SGX-ST”) covering financial years commencing from 1 January 2019. The Company is generally in 

compliance with the principles and provisions as set out in the 2018 Code and in areas where there are 

deviations from the 2018 Code, appropriate explanations are provided within this report. The Board considers that 

the alternative corporate governance practices are sufficient in meeting the underlying objective of the 2018 

Code. Please read this report with other sections of the Annual Report. 

 

(A)        BOARD MATTERS 

 

The Board's Conduct of Affairs 

Principle 1: The company is headed by an effective Board which is collectively responsible and works 

with Management for the long-term success of the company. 

The Board's primary role is to protect and enhance long-term shareholder value. The Board sets the overall 

strategy for the Group and supervises the management of the Company (the "Management"). To fulfil this role, 

the Board sets the Group's strategic direction, establishes goals for the Management and monitors the 

achievement of these goals, thereby taking responsibility for the overall corporate governance of the Group. 

In addition to its statutory duties, the Board's principal functions are: 

a. 

establish the overall business direction of the Group, with specific emphasis on business expansion and 

synergies; 

b. 

oversee the processes of evaluating the adequacy of internal controls, risk management, financial 

reporting and compliance, including safeguarding of shareholders’ interests and the Company’s assets; 

c. 

approve major investment and divestment proposals, material acquisitions and disposal of assets, major 

corporate policies on key operations, annual budget, the release of the Group’s quarterly and full year 

results and interested person transactions of a material nature; 

d. 

identify the key stakeholder groups and recognise that their perceptions affect the Company’s reputation; 

e. 

assume corporate governance practices directly or through the respective Board Committees (as defined 

below); and 

f. 

consider sustainability issues e.g. environmental and social factors, as part of its strategic formulation. 

 

All Directors exercise due diligence and independent judgment, and are obliged to act in good faith as fiduciaries 

and consider at all times the best interests of the Company. 

 

Our Directors are fiduciaries who act objectively in the best interests of the Company and hold Management 

accountable for performance. The Board puts in place a code of conduct and ethics, sets appropriate tone-from-

the-top and desired organisational culture, and ensures proper accountability within the company. Directors 

facing conflicts of interest recuse themselves from discussions and decisions involving the issues of conflict. 

 

The Company has adopted a set of Approving Authority &amp; Limit Guidelines (the “Guidelines”), setting out the 

level of authorisation required for specified transactions, including those that require Board approval. Under the 

Guidelines, new investments or divestments and all commitments to banking facilities granted by financial 

institutions to the Company require the approval of the Board. For instance, the Board had approved the 

liquidation of the Company’s subsidiaries, Polaris KKC Holdings Pte. Ltd. and CM Polaris Pte. Ltd., and the 

investment in a joint venture company, Marque Luxury Asia Pte. Ltd., in FY2019.  

 

To assist the Board in executing its responsibilities, the Board has delegated specific functions to the Audit and 

Risk Management Committee (“ARMC”), Nominating Committee (“NC”) and Remuneration Committee (“RC”) 

(together, the “Board Committees”, and each a “Board Committee”). These Board Committees function within 

clearly defined terms of reference and operating procedures, which are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure 

their continued relevance. The effectiveness of each Board Committee is also constantly monitored. Minutes of 

the Board Committee meetings are available to all Board members.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

The Board currently holds at least two (2) scheduled meetings each year. In addition, it holds additional meetings 

at such other times as may be necessary to address specific significant matters that may arise. Important matters 

concerning the Group are also put to the Board for its decision by way of written resolutions. The Company's 

constitution (the "Constitution”) has provisions for Board meetings to be held via telephone or videoconference. 

 

A record of the Directors’ attendance at meetings of Board and Board Committees for the financial year ended 31 

December 2019 (“FY2019”), as well as the number of such meetings, is set out as follows:

2019 

2 Ms Diana Airin has been appointed as an Independent Non-Executive Director on 8 April 2020 

3 Ms Evy Soenarjo has been appointed as a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director on 8 April 2020 

 

The Directors are updated regularly with changes to the SGX-ST Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist (the 

“Catalist Rules”), the Group's policies on risk management, corporate governance, insider trading and key 

changes in the relevant regulatory requirements, financial reporting standards and the relevant laws and 

regulations to facilitate effective discharge of their fiduciary duties as Board or Board Committee members. 

 

News releases issued by the SGX-ST and the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority ("ACRA”) which 

are relevant to the Directors are circulated to the Board. The Company Secretary would inform the Directors of 

upcoming conferences and seminars relevant to their roles as Directors of the Company. Such conferences and 

seminars as well as other training courses will be arranged and funded by the Company for all Directors. 

Annually, the external auditors will also update the ARMC and the Board on new and revised financial reporting 

standards that are applicable to the Company or the Group. 

 

Newly appointed Directors will receive appropriate training in corporate governance, if required. The Group has 

instituted an orientation program for new directors to familiarise them with the Group’s core business and 

governance practices. Further, any director who has had no prior experience as a director of a listed company is 

required to undergo training in the roles and responsibilities of a listed company director. The Group also provides 

background information about its history, mission and values to its Directors. In addition, the Management 

regularly updates and familiarizes the Directors on the business activities of the Company during Board meetings. 

Directors will also be given opportunities to visit the Group's operational facilities and meet the Management so 

as to gain a better understanding of the Group's business. 

 

A formal letter of appointment would be furnished to every newly-appointed director upon their appointment 

explaining, amongst other matters, their roles, obligations, duties and responsibilities as a member of the Board. 

 

The Board is provided with complete and adequate information in a timely manner prior to Board meetings and is 

kept informed of on-going developments within the Group. Board papers are generally made available to 

Directors in a timely manner, before the Board and Board Committee meetings, and would include financial 

management reports, reports on performance of the Group, papers pertaining to matters requiring the Board's 

decision, updates on key outstanding issues, strategic plans and developments in the Group. This is to enable 

the Directors to be properly briefed on matters to be considered at Board and Board Committee meetings to 

enable them to make informed decisions and discharge their duties and responsibilities. 

 

The Company has an on-going budget for all directors to attend appropriate courses, seminars and conferences 

for them to stay abreast of the relevant business developments and to develop and maintain their skills and 

knowledge at the Company’s expense. These include programmes run by the Singapore Institute of Directors or 

other training institutions. 

 

The Directors have separate and independent access to the Company Secretary at all times to address any 

enquires they may have. The Company Secretary or his/her nominee attends all Board and Board Committee 

meetings and is responsible for ensuring that established procedures and all relevant requirements of the 

Companies Act, Chapter 50 of Singapore (the “Companies Act”) and the Catalist Rules that are applicable to the 

Company are complied with. The Company Secretary assists the Chairman by preparing meeting agendas, 


23

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

 23	

attending Board and Board Committee meetings and preparing minutes of all Board and the Board Committee 

proceedings. Under the direction of the Chairman, the Company Secretary, with the support of the management 

staff, ensures good information flows within the Board and the Board Committees and between senior 

management and non-executive directors, advising the Board on all governance matters, as well as facilitating 

orientation and assisting with professional development as required. 

 

The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is subject to the Board’s approval.  

 

The Board is informed of all material events and transactions as and when they occur. All analysts’ and media 

reports, if any, on the Group are forwarded to the directors on an on-going basis. 

 

The Board has separate, independent and unrestricted access to the senior management of the Group at all 

times. Requests for information from the Board are dealt with promptly by the senior management. 

 

The Board seeks independent professional advice as and when necessary to enable it to discharge its 

responsibilities effectively. The Directors, whether as a group or individually, may seek and obtain legal and other 

independent professional advice, at the Company’s expense, concerning any aspect of the Group’s operations or 

undertakings in order to fulfil their roles and responsibilities as directors. 

 

Board Composition and Guidance 

Principle 2: The Board has an appropriate level of independence and diversity of thought and 

background in its composition to enable it to make decisions in the best interests of the Company. 

 

The Board comprises five (5) Directors of whom three (3) are Independent Non-Executive Directors, one (1) as 

Non-Independent Non-Executive Director and one (1) as Executive Director. A summary of the current 

composition of the Board and the Board Committees is set out as follows:

1 Ms Diana Airin has been appointed as an Independent Non-Executive Director on 8 April 2020 

2 Ms Evy Soenarjo has been appointed as a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director on 8 April 2020 

 

 

There is presently a strong and independent element on the Board, with Independent Directors making up a 

majority of the Board. The Company is in compliance with Provision 2.3 of the 2018 Code that Non-Executive 

Directors make up a majority of the Board. 

 

The NC adopts the definition in the 2018 Code as to what constitutes an Independent Director. Accordingly, the 

NC considers an "independent" Director as one who is independent in conduct, character and judgment, and has 

no relationship with the Company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers that could 

interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the Director's independent business 

judgment in the best interests of the Company. The NC has completed its annual review on the independence of 

each Independent Director and is of the view that these Directors are independent. The Board has reviewed and 

confirmed the independence of the independent directors. There are no Independent Directors who are deemed 

non-independent by the Board, notwithstanding the existence of a relationship as stated in the 2018 Code that 

would otherwise deem him not to be independent. 

 

Save for Mr Ong Kok Wah (“Mr Ong”), our Independent Non-Executive Chairman, who has served beyond nine 

(9) years since the date of his first appointment, there is no other Independent Director who has served on the 

Board beyond nine (9) years from the date of his first appointment. 

 

Notwithstanding that Mr Ong has served beyond nine (9) years since the date of his first appointment, the Board 

is of the view that Mr Ong is independent as he has: 

 

• 

contributed constructively and objectively throughout his term in the Company; 


24

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

 24	

• 

sought clarification and amplification of matters from time to time as he deemed fit, including through 

direct access to key management personnel; and 

• 

provided impartial advice and insights and has exercised his strong independent character and 

judgement in doing so. 

The following assessments were conducted and deliberated by the Board before arriving at the conclusion: 

 

• 

review of Board and Board Committee meetings minutes to assess questions and voting actions of the 

respective Independent Directors; 

• 

declarations of independence; and 

• 

board committee performance assessment done by the Directors. 

Accordingly, the NC and the Board has determined that Mr Ong’s tenure in office has not affected his 

independence and ability to bring independent and considered judgement to bear in his discharge of his duties as 

Non-Executive Chairman, Chairman of the NC and the RC, and member of the ARMC. 

 

The Board notes that, with effect from 1 January 2022, Mr Ong would have to comply with the requirements of 

Rule 406(3)(d)(iii) of the Catalist Rules for the purposes of continuing to be designated as an Independent 

Director and the Company will take the necessary steps, where appropriate, to comply with such requirements. 

 

Non-Executive Directors and Independent Directors exercise no management functions in the Group. Although all 

the Directors have equal responsibility for the performance of the Group, the role of the Non-Executive Directors 

and Independent Directors is particularly important in ensuring that the strategies proposed by the Management 

are fully discussed and rigorously examined, and take into account the long-term interests of not only the 

Shareholders, but also of the employees, customers, suppliers and the communities in which the Group conducts 

its business, in reviewing the performance of Management in meeting agreed goals and objectives, and 

monitoring the reporting of performance. The NC considers the Non-Executive Directors and Independent 

Directors to be of sufficient calibre and their views to be of sufficient weight such that no individual or a small 

group of individuals dominates the Board’s decision-making process. 

 

Non-executive directors and independent directors are scheduled to meet regularly, and as warranted, in the 

absence of key management personnel to discuss concerns or matters such as the effectiveness of 

Management. 

 

The Company has adopted a Board Diversity Policy which sets out the approach to achieve diversity of the 

Board. Pursuant to the Board Diversity Policy, on an annual basis, the NC will review the appropriateness of the 

current Board size and composition, taking into consideration the changes in the nature and scope of operations 

as well as the regulatory environment of the Group and, where appropriate, makes recommendations on changes 

to the Board to complement the Company’s corporate strategy and to ensure that there is an appropriate 

composition of members of the Board with suitably diverse backgrounds to meet the Group’s operational and 

business requirements. 

 

The Board recognises the importance of an appropriate balance and diversity of skills, experience, gender, age, 

knowledge and professional qualifications in building an effective Board. For this purpose, the NC reviews the 

Board’s collective skills matrix regularly.  

 

The current Board comprises persons who, as a group, have the necessary core competencies in areas such as 

accounting, finance, business and management experience, industry knowledge, strategic planning and 

customer-based experience and knowledge to lead and manage the Company. The diversity of the directors’ 

experience allows for the useful exchange of ideas and views. The profile of all Board members is set out in the 

section entitled ‘Board of Directors’ of this annual report. 

 

The current Board composition provides a diversity of skills, experience and knowledge to the Company as 

set out in the table below:

The Independent Non-Executive Directors have met at least once without the presence of Management in 

FY2019 to discuss matters such as internal controls, Board processes and succession plans. 

 

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") 

 

Principle 3: There is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and 

Management, and no one individual has unfettered powers of decision-making. 

 

The Board has adopted the recommendation of the 2018 Code to have separate persons appointed as Chairman 

and the CEO. This is to ensure an appropriate balance of power, increased accountability and greater capacity 

for the Board to exercise independent decision-making. The division of responsibilities between the Chairman 

and the CEO is clearly established, set out in writing and agreed by the Board.  

 

The Chairman of the Board and the CEO are separate persons. The Chairman of the Board is an independent 

director who is not part of the management team nor is he an immediate family member of the CEO. 

 

The Board is of the view that there are sufficient safeguards and checks to ensure that the process of decision 

making by the Board is independent and based on collective decisions without any individual exercising any 

considerable power or influence. Further, the ARMC, RC and NC are chaired by independent directors. 

 

Mr Soennerstedt Carl Johan Pontus (“Mr Soennerstedt”) is the Executive Director and CEO of the Company. His 

responsibilities include the execution of strategic business directions as well as the overseeing of the day-to-day 

business operations and business development of the property and investment holding segments of the Group. 

 

Mr Ong Kok Wah is an Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company and was appointed as Chairman of 

the Board on 1 March 2018. He is consulted on the Group’s strategic direction and formulation of policies. The 

Chairman also ensures the smooth running of the Board.  

 

As Chairman, Mr Ong is responsible for, amongst other things, exercising control over the quality, quantity and 

timeliness of the flow of information between the Management and the Board, and ensuring compliance with the 

Company’s guidelines on corporate governance along with promoting high standards of corporate governance. 

 

The Chairman is also responsible for, amongst other things, effectively representing the Board to the 

shareholders, ensuring that Board meetings are held when necessary, setting the Board meeting agenda in 

consultation with the Company Secretary, acting as facilitator at Board meetings and maintaining regular dialogue 

with the Management on all operational matters. At annual general meetings and other shareholders’ meetings, 

the Chairman ensures constructive dialogue between shareholders, the Board and the Management. 

 

The Chairman also promotes a culture of openness and debate at the Board, ensuring that the Directors receive 

complete, adequate and timely information, and facilitates the effective contribution of Non-Executive Directors in 

particular. 

 

The Company did not appoint a lead independent director given that the majority of the Board and the Chairman 

are independent.  

 

Board Membership 

 

Principle 4: The Board has a formal and transparent process for the appointment and re-appointment of 

directors, taking into account the need for progressive renewal of the Board. 

 

The NC, regulated by a set of written terms of reference, comprises four (4) members, the majority of whom, 

including the Chairman, are independent non-executive directors. The NC meets at least once a year. The 

members of the NC are as follows: 

 

1. 

Ong Kok Wah (Chairman, Independent Non-Executive Director) 

2. 

Masahiko Yabuki (Member, Independent Non-Executive Director) 

3. 

Soennerstedt Carl Johan Pontus (Member, Executive Director) 

4. 

Diana Airin (Member, Independent Non-Executive Director) 

 

The NC is responsible for: 

 

a. 

The review of structure, size and composition of the Board and the Board Committees; 

b. 

The review of succession plans for the Board Chairman, Directors, CEO and members of senior 

management; 

c. 

The development of a transparent process for evaluating the performance of the board, its Board 

Committees and Directors, including assessing whether Directors are able to commit enough time to 


26

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

 26	

discharge their responsibilities and the maximum number of listed company Board representations which 

a Director may hold; 

d. 

The review of training and professional development programmes for the Board and its Directors; 

e. 

The appointment and reappointment of all directors (including any alternate directors, if any); and 

f. 

The review and confirmation of the independence of each Director. 

 

The NC is also responsible for identifying and recommending new board members to the Board, after considering 

the necessary and desirable competencies of the candidates which include: 

 

a. 

academic and professional qualifications; 

b. 

industry experience; 

c. 

number of other directorships; 

d. 

relevant experience as a director; and 

e. 

ability and adequacy in carrying out required tasks. 

 

The NC leads the process for board appointments and makes recommendations to the Board. The integrated 

process of appointment includes: 

 

a. 

developing a framework on desired competencies and diversity on the Board; 

b. 

assessing current competencies and diversity on the Board; 

c. 

developing desired profiles of new directors; 

d. 

initiating search for new directors including personal networks and external searches, if necessary; 

e. 

shortlist and interview potential director candidates; 

f. 

recommending appointments and retirements to the Board; and 

g. 

election at general meeting. 

 

New Directors are appointed by way of a Board resolution following which they are subject to re-election at the 

next Annual General Meeting of the Company (“AGM”). 

 

In accordance with the Company’s Constitution, one-third, or if their number is not a multiple of three (3), the 

number nearest to one-third of the Directors are required to retire from office by rotation at each AGM (provided 

that no Director holding office as managing director shall be subject to retirement by rotation or be taken into 

account in determining the number of Directors to retire). Newly appointed Directors will hold office only until the 

next AGM following their appointments and they shall be eligible for re-election. Such Directors are not taken into 

account in determining the number of Directors who are to retire by rotation at that meeting. In any case, pursuant 

to Rule 720(4), all Directors must submit themselves for re-nomination and re-appointment at least once every 

three (3) years. 

 

In making recommendations for the selection, appointment and re-appointment of Directors, the NC evaluates the 

composition and progressive renewal of the Board and the Director’s competencies, commitment, contribution 

and performance, such as his/her attendance at meetings of the Board or Board Committees, and, where 

applicable, his preparedness, participation, candour and any other special contributions.  

 

Each member of the NC has abstained from reviewing and approving his or her own re-election. 

 

The NC has recommended to the Board that Mr Masahiko Yabuki be (“Mr Yabuki”) be nominated for re-election 

at the forthcoming AGM in accordance with Article 86 of the Company’s Constitution. Ms Diana Airin (“Ms Airin”) 

and Evy Soenarjo (“Ms Soenarjo”) will also be nominated for re-election at the forthcoming AGM in accordance 

with Article 93 of the Company’s Constitution. 

 

In making the recommendations, the NC has considered Mr Yabuki’s, Ms Airin’s and Ms Soenarjo’s (collectively, 

the “Retiring Directors” and each, the “Retiring Director”) overall contribution and performance, both past and 

anticipated. Mr Yabuki will, upon re-election as a Director, remain as Independent Non-Executive Director of the 

Company, and Chairman of the ARMC and a member of the NC and RC. Ms Airin will, upon re-election as a 

Director, remain as Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company, and a member of the ARMC, NC and 

RC. Ms Soenarjo will, upon re-election as a Director, remain as Non-Independent Non-Executive Director of the 

Company, and a member of the ARMC and RC. 

 

There are no relationships (including immediate family relationships) between our Chairman, Mr Ong Kok Wah, 

and the CEO, other Directors or any of the substantial shareholders of the Company.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

in respect of each of the Retiring Directors is set out in on page 38 to 43 of the Annual Report.  

 

The NC reviews annually the declarations of independence made by the Company’s Independent Non-Executive 

Directors based on the definition of independence in the 2018 Code. The NC has reviewed the independence of 

each director for FY2019 and is of the view that the Independent Directors are independent as defined in the 

2018 Code and are able to exercise judgment on the corporate affairs of the Group independent of the 

Management. 

 

The NC monitors and determines annually whether directors who have multiple board representations and other 

principal commitments, give sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Company and adequately carry out 

his/her duties as a Director of the Company. The NC takes into account the results of the assessment of the 

effectiveness of the individual Director and his/her actual conduct on the Board, in making this determination.  

 

Currently, the NC and the Board have not determined the maximum number of listed company board 

representations which any Director may hold. The NC and the Board will review the requirement to determine the 

maximum number of listed company Board representations as and when necessary. 

 

During the year, the Board has appointed an additional Independent Non-Executive Director, Ms Airin and an 

additional Non-Independent Non-Executive Director, Ms Soenarjo. 

 

No alternate director has been appointed to the Board for FY2019. 

 

Board Performance 

 

Principle 5: The Board undertakes a formal annual assessment of its effectiveness as a whole, and that of 

each of its board committees and individual directors. 

 

The NC adopts a formal system of evaluating the Board as a whole and its Board Committees every year. A 

performance evaluation of the Board and each Board Committee is carried out. The assessment parameters 

include the evaluation of the size and composition of the Board and its Board Committees, the access to 

information, processes and accountability, performance in relation to the discharging of its principle 

responsibilities, the Directors' standard of conduct and the performance of the Board Committees.  Through a 

formal written performance evaluation of the Board and Board Committees, the Board is of the view that the 

Board and Board Committees operate effectively and each Director is contributing to the effectiveness of the 

Board and the Board Committees due to the active participation of each member during meetings.  

 

The annual evaluation exercise provides an opportunity to obtain constructive feedback from each Director on 

whether the Board’s procedures and processes has allowed him/her to discharge his/her duties effectively and to 

propose changes which may be made to enhance the Board's effectiveness as a whole. The collated findings are 

reported and recommendations are made to the Board for consideration and for further improvements to help the 

Board to discharge its duties more effectively. 

 

The NC is of the view that the Board has met its performance objectives for FY2019. No external facilitator was 

used in the evaluation process as the Board believes that the quality and objectivity of the current process and 

evaluations implemented are sufficient and adequate. 

 

The NC conducts an evaluation of the performance of individual Directors annually and for re-election or re-

appointment of any Director. The assessment of each Director’s performance is undertaken by the NC Chairman. 

The criteria for assessment include but is not limited to the particular Director’s attendance record at meetings of 

the Board and Board Committees, commitment of time, intensity of participation at meetings, quality of 

discussions, knowledge and abilities, engagement with Management, maintenance of independence and any 

special contributions. For FY2019, the NC, in concurrence with the NC Chairman, is satisfied that each Director is 

contributing to the overall effectiveness of the Board. 

 

(B)        REMUNERATION MATTERS 

 

Procedures for Developing Remuneration Policies 

 

Principle 6: The Board has a formal and transparent procedure for developing policies on director and 

executive remuneration, and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual directors and key 

management personnel. No director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration. 

 

The RC, regulated by a set of written terms of reference, comprises four (4) members, all of whom are Non-

Executive Directors and a majority of whom, including the RC Chairman, are Independent Directors. The 

members of the RC are as follows: 

 

1. 

Ong Kok Wah (Chairman, Independent Non-Executive Director) 

2. 

Masahiko Yabuki (Member, Independent Non-Executive Director)

3. 

Diana Airin (Member, Independent Non-Executive Director) 

4. 

Evy Soenarjo (Member, Non-Independent Non-Executive Director) 

 

 

The principal function of the RC is to ensure that a formal and transparent procedure is in place for fixing the 

remuneration packages of directors and key management personnel of the Group. 

 

Under its terms of reference, the RC is responsible for reviewing and recommending a remuneration framework 

for the Board and the Company’s key management personnel. The RC also reviews and recommends to the 

Board the specific remuneration packages for each Director as well as the Company’s key management 

personnel. The aim is to build capable and committed management teams, through competitive compensation, 

focused management, and progressive policies which will attract, motivate and retain a pool of talented 

executives to meet the current and future growth of the Company. In discharging their duties, the members have 

access to advice from the human resources department and external advisors as and when they deem 

necessary.  

 

To ensure that the remuneration package is competitive and sufficient to attract, retain and motivate the key 

management personnel, the RC also takes into consideration industry practices and norms in the compensation 

review. The RC as part of its review ensures that all aspects of remuneration, including and not limited to 

director’s fees, salaries, allowances, bonuses, options, benefits-in-kind and termination terms are covered for 

each director and key management personnel, to ensure they are fair. 

 

No independent consultant is engaged to advise on the remuneration of all Directors. The RC will seek external 

expert advice should such a need arise. The Company did not engage any remuneration consultant in FY2019. 

 

The RC reviews the service contracts of the Company’s Executive Directors and key management personnel. 

Services contracts for Executive Directors are for a fixed appointment period. There are no onerous 

compensation commitments on the part of the Company in the event of an early termination of the service of the 

Executive Directors and key management personnel. 

 

Level and Mix of Remuneration 

 

Principle 7: The level and structure of remuneration of the Board and key management personnel are 

appropriate and proportionate to the sustained performance and value creation of the company, taking 

into account the strategic objectives of the Company. 

 

The remuneration policy for Executive Directors is structured to link rewards to corporate and individual 

performance. 

 

Our Executive Directors’ remuneration consists of a salary, bonuses and other benefits. A proportion of the 

remuneration for the Executive Directors is linked to performance in the form of a performance bonus. Executive 

Directors are paid incentives based on achievement of performance targets of their respective business units set 

at the beginning of the financial year. In setting the targets, due regard is given to the financial and commercial 

health and business needs of the Group. Executive Directors do not receive directors’ fees. 

 

The Group has also entered into letters of employment with all of the executive officers. Their compensation 

consists of salary, bonus and performance awards that are dependent on the performance of the Group. 

 

The Company does not have any long-term incentive scheme or schemes involving the offer of shares or grant of 

options. In evaluating long-term incentives, the RC takes into consideration the costs and benefits of such 

schemes.  

 

Non-executive directors are remunerated under a framework of fixed fees for serving on the Board and Board 

Committees, taking into account factors such as effort, time spent and responsibilities. Fees for Non-Executive 

Directors are subject to the approval of shareholders at the AGM. 

 

In setting remuneration packages, the Company takes into consideration the remuneration and employment 

conditions within the same industry and in comparable companies, as well as the Group’s relative performance 

and the performance of the individuals.  

 

The Company does not implement the use of contractual provisions as it is of the view that such provisions would 

not enhance the performance of its Executive Directors and key management personnel. However, the letters of 

employment with all executive officers allow the Company the right to pursue appropriate action against executive 

officers and key management personnel for violation of company policies and other fraudulent acts.

Disclosure on Remuneration 

 

Principle 8: The company is transparent on its remuneration policies, level and mix of remuneration, the 

procedure for setting remuneration, and the relationships between remuneration, performance and value 

creation. 

 

Given the highly competitive environment it is operating in and the confidentiality attached to remuneration 

matters, the Company believes that fully disclosing the remuneration of each Director and the CEO would be 

prejudicial to its business interests. The Company has instead disclosed the remuneration of each Director and 

the CEO in bands of S$200,000. The aggregate value of remuneration to Directors has been disclosed on page 

30 of the Annual Report. 

 

The Company has also disclosed the remuneration of each key management personnel (who are not directors or 

the CEO) in bands of S$200,000 below. The aggregate value of remuneration to the key management personnel 

(who are not directors or the CEO) has been disclosed on page 30 of the Annual Report.

The Board, on review, is of the opinion that disclosing specific details on the performance conditions used to

of the performance conditions used to determine the Directors’ remuneration have been met. 

 

(C) ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT 

 

Risk Management and Internal Controls  

 

Principle 9: The Board is responsible for the governance of risk and ensures that Management maintains 

a sound system of risk management and internal controls to safeguard the interests of the company and 

its shareholders.  

 

The Board, with the assistance of the ARMC, is responsible for the governance of risk by ensuring the adequacy 

and effectiveness of the system of risk management and internal controls to safeguard shareholders’ interests 

and the Group’s assets. 

 

The ARMC monitors and assists the Board in determining the nature and extent of the significant risks which the 

Company is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives and value creation. 

 

The details on ARMC can be found on pages 32 to 34 of the Annual Report. 

 

The Board, assisted by the ARMC, will:  

 

a. 

ensure that the Management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls to 

safeguard shareholders’ interests and the Group’s assets;  

b. 

determine the nature and extent of the significant risks, and the level of risk tolerance, which the Board is 

willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives; 

c. 

provide oversight in the design, implementation and monitoring of the risk management framework, and 

system of internal controls (including financial, operational, compliance and information technology 

controls), including ensuring that Management puts in place action plans to mitigate the risks identified 

where possible;  

d. 

review the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management and internal controls systems annually; 

and  

e. 

set and instill the appropriate risk-aware culture throughout the Company for effective risk governance.  

 

The Company’s internal auditors conduct an annual review of the effectiveness of the Company’s material 

internal controls, including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls, and a risk 

assessment at least annually to ensure the adequacy thereof. The findings of the review conducted by the 

internal auditors together with the review undertaken by the external auditors as part of their statutory audit are 

presented in their findings to the ARMC. Any material non-compliance or failures in internal controls and 

recommendations for improvements are reported to the ARMC. The ARMC also reviews the effectiveness of the 

actions taken by the Management on the recommendations made by the internal auditors and external auditors in 

this respect.  

 

The Board recognises that it is responsible for maintaining a system of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ 

investments and the Group’s businesses and assets, while Management is responsible for establishing and 

implementing the internal control procedures in a timely and appropriate manner. The role of the internal auditor 

is to assist the ARMC in ensuring that the controls are effective and functioning as intended, to undertake 

investigations as directed by the ARMC and to conduct regular in-depth audits of high risk areas. 

 

The Board notes that the system of risk management and internal controls established by the Management 

provides reasonable, but not absolute assurance that the Group will not be significantly affected by any event that 

can be reasonably foreseen as it strives to achieve its business objectives. However, the Board also notes that no 

system of risk management and internal controls can provide absolute assurance in this regard, or absolute 

assurance against poor judgment in decision-making, human error, losses, fraud or other irregularities.  

 

The Board has received assurance from the CEO and Senior Finance Manager that:  

(i) 

the financial records have been properly maintained and the financial statements for FY2019 give a true 

and fair view in all material respects of the Company’s operations and finances; and  

(ii) 

the Group’s risk management and internal control systems are adequate and operating effectively in all 

material respects given its current business environment.  

 

Based on the risk management processes and policy framework, internal controls system established and 

maintained by the Group, reviews performed by the various Board Committees and key management 

personnel, work performed by the external auditors and internal auditors, and the assurances from the CEO 

and Senior Finance Manager, the Board, with the concurrence of the ARMC, is of the opinion that the Group’s 

internal controls and risk management systems are adequate and effective in addressing the financial,

operational, compliance and information technology risks of the Group as at 31 December 2019.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Apart from the duties listed above, the ARMC is given the task of commissioning investigations into matters 

where there is suspected fraud or irregularity, or failure of internal controls or infringement of any law, rule or 

regulation which has or is likely to have a material impact on the Company’s operating results or financial 

position, and to review its findings. The ARMC has full access to and the co-operation of Management and the full 

discretion to invite any Director or Executive Officer to attend its meetings, and has reasonable resources to 

enable it to discharge its functions properly.  

 

The external auditors have unrestricted access to the ARMC.  

 

The ARMC is responsible for reviewing the audit reports from the internal auditors and external auditors and 

assists the Board in overseeing the Management in the formulation, updating and maintenance of an adequate 

and effective risk management framework and internal controls.  

 

The ARMC recommends to the Board on proposals to shareholders on the appointment, re-appointment and 

removal of the external auditors and approving the remuneration of the external auditors. 

 

The ARMC will meet with the external auditors and internal auditors without the presence of the Management, as 

and when necessary and at least annually, to review the adequacy of audit arrangements, with emphasis on the 

scope and quality of their audit, the independence, objectivity and observations of the external auditors.  

 

In FY2019, the ARMC met with the External Auditors once in the absence of key management personnel. 

 

The ARMC is kept updated annually and from time to time on any changes to the accounting and financial 

reporting standards with trainings conducted by professionals or the external auditors. The external auditors will 

work with the Management to ensure that the Group complies with the new accounting standards, if applicable.  

 

In the review of the financial statements for FY2019, the ARMC had discussed with the Management and the 

external auditors on changes to accounting standards and significant issues and assumptions that impact the 

financial statements. The following significant matters that impact the financial statements were reviewed by the 

ARMC in relation to their materiality and appropriate methodology/assessment. These matters were also 

discussed with Management and the external auditors. 

 

Key Audit Matters  

 

Approach and measures 

Impairment of trade receivables 

 

The ARMC considered the approach and methodology used by 

management in determining the recoverable amount of trade 

receivables. The ARMC was satisfied that the approach and 

methodology used by management in this process was appropriate. 

 

The ARMC concluded that the Group’s accounting treatment and estimates in each of the significant matters 

were appropriate. All the key audit matters (“KAMs”) that were raised by the external auditors for FY2019 have 

been addressed by the ARMC and are covered in the above commentary. The KAMs in the auditors’ report for 

FY2019 can be found on pages  48 to 50 of the Annual Report. 

 

External Auditors 

 

The Company and its subsidiaries are audited by Moore Stephens LLP. The ARMC has conducted an annual 

review of the performance of the external auditor, taking into consideration the Audit Quality Indicators Disclosure 

Framework recommended by ACRA as a reference. The Group’s associate company based in the Philippines, 

Polaristitans Philippines Inc., was audited by OO &amp; Associates (formerly known as Ong, Ordonez &amp; Associates) 

and reviewed by the Group’s external auditor, Moore Stephens LLP, for group consolidation purposes. 

 

 

The ARMC also undertook a review of the independence and objectivity of the external auditor through 

discussions with the external auditor and confirm that no non-audit services were provided to the Company. The 

aggregate amount of audit fees payable to the external auditor in FY2019 was S$97,000. No non-audit fees were 

paid to the external auditor in FY2019. The ARMC is satisfied with the independence of the external auditor and 

is not aware of any matter that would affect the independence of the external auditor.  

 

Accordingly, the ARMC has recommended to the Board the reappointment of Moore Stephens LLC as external 

auditors of the Company at the forthcoming AGM. In appointing the audit firms for the Group, the Board and the 

ARMC are satisfied and confirm that the Group has complied with Rule 712 and Rule 715 of the Catalist Rules. 

 

There is no former partner or director of the Company’s existing auditing firm or auditing corporation that is acting 

as a member of the Company’s ARMC.

Internal Audit 

Currently, the Group has outsourced its internal audit function to Ardent Business Advisory Pte. Ltd. (the “IA”) 

which reports directly to the ARMC. The IA has an administrative reporting function to Management where 

planning, co-ordinating, managing and implementing internal audit work cycle are concerned. The work 

undertaken by the IA is carried out in accordance with the standards set by internationally recognised 

professional bodies including Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing set by the Institute of 

Internal Auditors. The IA will report their audit findings and recommendations directly to the ARMC. The IA has 

unfettered access to all the Group’s documents, records, properties and personnel, including access to the 

ARMC.  

 

For FY2019, the ARMC has reviewed and approved the internal audit plan to ensure the adequacy of the scope 

of audit, the IA’s reports, proposed follow-up actions implemented by the Management and has noted that the 

necessary co-operation required from the Management has been provided to enable the IA to perform its function 

effectively. In addition, the experience of the IA (including its assigned engagement personnel) has been 

reviewed, and the ARMC is satisfied that the IA is adequately qualified (given, inter alia, its adherence to 

standards set by internationally recognised professional bodies) and resourced, and has the appropriate standing 

in the Company to discharge its duties effectively and independently. As such, the ARMC is of the view that the 

internal audit function of the Company is independent, effective and adequately resourced for FY2019. 

 

Based on the internal audit reports and management controls in place, the ARMC is satisfied that the internal 

control systems (including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls) provide 

reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that proper accounting records are maintained and financial 

statements are reliable. In the course of their statutory audit, the Company’s external auditors will highlight any 

material internal control weaknesses which have come to their attention in carrying out their normal audit, which 

is designed primarily to enable them to express their opinion on the financial statements. Such material internal 

control weaknesses noted during their audit, and recommendations, if any, by the external auditors are reported 

to the ARMC. 

 

Whistle-Blowing Policy 

 

The Company, with the assistance of the ARMC has put in place a “whistleblowing” process and has formulated 

the guidelines for a Whistle-Blowing Policy for the Group. Such a policy serves to encourage and provide a 

channel for staff to report, in good faith and without fear of reprisals, concerns about possible improprieties in 

financial reporting, bullying behaviour and other matters to the Independent Non-Executive Chairman. It has a 

well-defined process which ensures independent investigation of issues/concerns raised and appropriate follow 

up action to be taken. All reports will be promptly submitted to the ARMC which is responsible for investigating 

and coordinating corrective action. All information received will be treated confidentially and the identity and the 

interest of all whistle-blowers will be protected. Anonymous disclosures will be accepted and requests for 

anonymity will be honoured. Details of the whistle-blowing policy and arrangements have been made available to 

all employees via internal emails and bulletin boards. 

 

No whistle blowing letter or complaint was received in FY2019.  

 

(D)       SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND ENGAGEMENT 

 

Shareholder rights and conduct of General Meetings 

 

Principle 11: The company treats all shareholders fairly and equitably in order to enable them to exercise 

shareholders' rights and have the opportunity to communicate their views on matters affecting the 

company. The Company gives shareholders a balanced and understandable assessment of its 

performance, position and prospects. 

 

The Company does not practice selective disclosure. In line with the continuous obligations of the Company 

under the Catalist Rules and the Companies Act, the Board’s policy is that all shareholders should equally and on 

a timely basis be informed of all major developments that impact the Group via the Singapore Exchange Network 

(the “SGXNet”). 

 

Accountability to shareholders is demonstrated through the presentation of the Group’s quarterly and full year 

financial statements, results announcements and all announcements on the Group’s business and operations. 

 

The Management provides the Board with appropriately detailed management accounts of the Company’s 

performance, position and prospects on a quarterly basis and when deemed appropriate by particular 

circumstances. 

 

The Board also takes adequate steps to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements and 

observes obligations of continuing disclosure under the Catalist Rules. For example, in line with the Catalist 

Rules, the Board provides a negative assurance statement to the shareholders in respect of the interim financial 

statements. 


35

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

 35	

 

The Management maintains regular contact and communication with the Board by various means including the 

preparation and circulation to all Board members of quarterly and full year financial statements of the Group. This 

allows the Board to monitor the Group’s performance as well as Management’s achievements of the goals and 

objectives determined and set by the Board. 

 

The Board views the AGM as the principal forum for dialogue with shareholders, being an opportunity for 

shareholders to raise issues pertaining to the proposed resolutions and/or ask the directors or the Management 

questions regarding the Company and its operations. Shareholders are informed of the rules, including voting 

procedures, that govern general meetings of shareholders. 

 

Shareholders have the opportunity to participate effectively and to vote in the AGM either in person or in absentia 

by proxy. The Company’s Constitution allows a shareholder to appoint up to two (2) proxies to attend and vote in 

his or her place at general meetings. A shareholder who is a relevant intermediary pursuant to Section 181 of the 

Companies Act may appoint more than two (2) proxies, but each proxy must be appointed to exercise the rights 

attached to a different share or shares held by such shareholder. 

 

The Company’s Constitution does not expressly allow for other methods for voting in absentia at general 

meetings of shareholders such as voting via mail, e-mail or fax.  

 

Amid the COVID-19 situation in Singapore, on 26 March 2020, the Infectious Diseases (Measures to Prevent 

Spread of COVID-19) Regulations 2020 (“Regulations”) came into force. The Regulations prohibit certain 

activities and events (e.g. conventions), limit attendance for non-prohibited events to 10 individuals, and impose 

safe distancing measures for non-prohibited events held in public places. 

 

In light of the current developments on the COVID-19 situation, the Company has decided not to proceed with its 

AGM and/or general meetings before 30 April 2020. In this regard, as announced on 7 April 2020, the Company 

has obtained approval from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) and the Singapore 

Exchange Regulation, on 3 April 2020 and 6 April 2020 respectively, for an extension of time until 29 June 2020 

for the Company to hold its AGM for FY2019. Accordingly, the Company will be issuing its notice of AGM to 

shareholders at a later date and, in any case, by 7 June 2020. The Company will conduct the meeting in a 

manner that (a) provides an opportunity for shareholders to ask questions, (b) provides for the meeting to be 

shown by “live” webcast and (c) allows for proxy voting. Instructions and procedures to register and attend the 

meetings will be announced via the Company’s website and on SGXNet. 

 

Resolutions to be passed at general meetings are always separate and distinct in terms of issues and are 

consistent with the 2018 Code’s guideline that companies should avoid ‘bundling’ resolutions unless the 

resolutions are interdependent and linked so as to form one significant proposal. 

 

The Company adheres to the requirements of the Catalist Rules and the 2018 Code whereby all resolutions at 

the Company’s general meetings held on or after 1 August 2015 are put to vote by poll. The voting of the 

resolutions at the general meetings is conducted by electronic polling for greater transparency in the voting 

process. The detailed voting results of each of the resolutions tabled are announced on the same day after the 

meetings. The total numbers of votes cast for and against the resolutions are also announced after the meetings 

via SGXNet. 

 

Each item of special business included in the notice of the general meetings will be accompanied by explanation 

of the effects of the proposed resolution. Separate resolutions are proposed for each substantially separate issue 

at general meetings. The Company will make available minutes of general meetings to shareholders upon their 

request.  

 

In general meetings, shareholders are given the opportunity to communicate their views and direct questions to 

directors and Management regarding the Company. The Chairman of the Board and the respective Chairman of 

the ARMC, NC and RC are normally present and available to address questions from shareholders at general 

meetings. The external auditors are also present to address shareholders’ queries on the conduct of audit and the 

preparation and content of the Independent Auditors’ report. The Company will publish minutes of the general 

meetings on the Company’s website, including its responses from management and the Board to substantial 

queries and relevant comments from shareholders.  

 

All Directors have attended the AGM 2018 held on 26 April 2019. 

 

The Group does not have a formal dividend policy at present. The form, frequency and amount of dividends 

declared each year will take into consideration the Group’s profit, cash position, positive cash flow generated from 

operations, projected capital requirements for business growth and other factors as the Board may deem 

appropriate. As the Company has registered accumulated losses as at 31 December 2019 and its current priority 

is to achieve long-term capital growth for the benefit of shareholders, no dividends were declared or 

recommended for FY2019 and its profits shall therefore be retained for investment into the future. The Board 

continues to monitor the financial position of the Company and will propose dividends at the appropriate time in

the best interest of the shareholders. 

 

Engagement with Shareholders 

 

Principle 12: The company communicates regularly with its shareholders and facilities the participation 

of shareholders during general meetings and other dialogues to allow shareholders to communicate their 

views on various matters affecting the company. 

 

The Board welcomes the views of shareholders on matters affecting the Group, whether at the general meetings 

of shareholders or on an ad-hoc basis. At general meetings, shareholders will be given the opportunity to express 

their views and ask Directors or the Management questions regarding the Group. 

 

Shareholders are informed of general meetings through announcements released via the SGXNet. Additionally, 

annual reports are prepared and issued to all shareholders within the mandatory period. Notices of shareholders’ 

meetings are advertised in a newspaper in Singapore. AGM is held within four (4) months after the close of the 

financial year. 

 

Shareholders are encouraged to attend the Company’s general meetings to ensure a high level of accountability 

and to stay informed of the Group’s strategies and growth plans. Notice of the general meeting is issued to 

shareholders, together with explanatory notes or a circular on items of special businesses (if necessary), 

providing at least 14 or 21 days’ notice in writing, as the case may be, (exclusive both of the day on which the 

notice is served or deemed to be served and of the day for which the notice is given). The Board welcomes 

questions from shareholders who wish to raise issues, either informally or formally before or during the general 

meetings. 

 

A shareholder who is not a “relevant intermediary” may appoint up to two (2) proxies during his absence, to 

attend, speak and vote on his behalf at general meetings, provided that a shareholder holding management 

shares may appoint more than two (2) proxies in respect of the management shares held by him. Shareholders 

who are “relevant intermediaries” such as banks, capital markets services licence holders which provide custodial 

services for securities and the CPF Board, are allowed to appoint more than two (2) proxies to attend, speak and 

vote at general meetings. This will enable indirect investors, including CPF investors, to be appointed as proxies 

to participate at shareholders’ meetings. 

 

The Company does not practice selective disclosure. Price sensitive information is first publicly released through 

the SGXNet before the Company meets with any investors or analysts. In line with continuous obligations of the 

Company pursuant to the Catalist Rules and the Companies Act, the Board’s policy is that all shareholders 

should be equally and timely informed of all major developments that will impact the Company or the Group. 

Information is communicated to shareholders on a timely basis through the SGXNet and/or the press. Where 

there is inadvertent disclosure made to a selected group, the Company will make the same disclosure publicly to 

all others as soon as practicable. 

 

Shareholders can access financial information, corporate announcements, press releases, annual reports 

(including 

sustainability 

reports) 

and 

the 

profile 

of 

the 

Group 

at 

the 

Company’s 

website 

at 

http://www.wearepolaris.com. The website also contains a dedicated section on “Investor Relations” to further 

enhance communication with investors or other stakeholders, and sets out an email address through which 

shareholders may contact the Company with questions and through which the Company may respond to such 

questions. 

 

(E) MANAGING STAKEHOLDERS RELATIONSHIPS 

 

Engagement with Stakeholders 

 

Principle 13: The Board adopts an inclusive approach by considering and balancing the needs and 

interests of material stakeholders, as part of its overall responsibility to ensure that the best interests of 

the company are served. 

 

The Company has a materiality assessment process to identify the key stakeholders who have direct influence on 

the business and operations which includes, but is not limited to, customers, employees, shareholders and 

investors, suppliers, business partners and Government and regulators. The Company continuously seeks to 

improve communication with its stakeholders via various engagement platforms/communication channels.  

 

Key concerns of stakeholders and the Company’s strategies in relation to the management of stakeholder 

relationships are reported on in the Company’s Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 31 December 

2019 (the “Sustainability Report 2019”) on pages 10 to20  in the Annual Report. 

 

The stakeholders can also access the Sustainability Report 2019 and other relevant announcement such as 

financial information, corporate announcements, annual reports and the profile of the Group via Company's 

website at http://www.wearepolaris.com.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF 

 

POLARIS LTD. 

(Incorporated in Singapore)

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements 

 

Opinion 

 

We have audited the financial statements of Polaris Ltd. (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively 

the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position of the Group and the 

statement of financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2019, and the consolidated statements of 

income and comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement 

of cash flows of the Group for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a 

summary of significant accounting policies.  

 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of 

the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, Chapter 50 

(the “Act”) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)s”) so as to give a true 

and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the financial position of the Company 

as at 31 December 2019 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and 

consolidated cash flows of the Group for the year ended on that date. 

 

 

Basis for Opinion 

 

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (“SSAs”). Our responsibilities 

under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial 

Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and 

Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public 

Accountants and Accounting Entities (“ACRA Code”) together with the ethical requirements that are 

relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 

responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit 

evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 

 

 

Key Audit Matters 

 

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our 

audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our 

audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 

separate opinion on these matters.

Key Audit Matters (cont’d) 

 

Key Audit Matter 

How our audit addressed the key audit matter 

 

 

Impairment of trade receivables 

 

As at 31 December 2019, the carrying amount of the 

Group’s trade receivables amounted to S$6,835,000 

(Note 20), which represented approximately 46% of 

its current assets. 

 

The collectability of trade receivables is a key 

element 

of 

the 

Group’s 

working 

capital 

management, and is managed on an ongoing basis 

by management. The Group determines the expected 

credit loss (“ECL”) of trade receivables by making 

debtor-specific assessments of expected impairment 

losses for overdue trade receivables and uses a 

provision matrix for the remaining trade receivables 

that is based on the Group’s historical observed 

default rates, customers’ ability to pay and adjusted 

with forward-looking information. The assessment 

of correlation between historical observed default 

rates, forecast economic conditions and expected 

credit losses require the management to exercise 

significant judgement. Accordingly, we determined 

this as a key audit matter. 

 

The Group’s accounting policies on allowance for 

impairment and the critical accounting estimates and 

judgements thereon are disclosed in Note 3(o) and 

Note 4(b)(i) to the financial statements, respectively. 

Our response 

 

Our audit procedures included, amongst others, 

obtaining an understanding of the Group’s processes 

and key controls relating to the monitoring of trade 

receivables and considering their aging to identify 

collection risks. We performed audit procedures 

including, 

amongst 

others, 

reviewing 

the 

reasonableness of significant judgements used by the 

management in assessing the recoverability of trade 

receivables and reviewing management’s assessment 

of the recoverability of overdue trade receivables. 

We tested the reasonableness of management’s 

assumptions and inputs used to develop the provision 

matrix, through analyses of ageing of trade 

receivables and historical credit loss experience, and 

reviewed data and information that management has 

used, including consideration of forward-looking 

information based on specific economic data. We 

checked the arithmetic accuracy of management’s 

computation of the ECL. We checked to subsequent 

receipts from major debtors after the year end. We 

obtained documentary evidence, representation and 

explanations from management to assess the 

recoverability of overdue outstanding debts, where 

applicable. 

 

In addition, we reviewed the adequacy of the 

disclosures relating to the allowance for impairment 

loss on trade receivables and credit risk in Note 20(a) 

and Note 33(a) to the financial statements, 

respectively. 

 

Our findings 

 

Based 

on 

our 

audit 

procedures, 

we 

found 

management’s assessment of the impairment of trade 

receivables to be reasonable and the disclosures to be 

appropriate.

Other Information  

 

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information 

included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 

 

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form 

of assurance conclusion thereon. 

 

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 

and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial 

statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based 

on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, 

we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. 

 

 

Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements 

 

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in 

accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of 

internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against 

loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded 

as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of 

assets. 

 

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to 

continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going 

concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, 

or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 

 

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements 

 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free 

from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 

opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 

accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 

from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 

expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 

 

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional 

scepticism throughout the audit. We also: 

 

• 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 

fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 

evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 

detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 

fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 

internal control. 

 

• 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 

that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 

effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. 

 

• 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 

estimates and related disclosures made by management. 

 

• 

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 

based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or 

conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If 

we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 

report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 

modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 

auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a 

going concern. 

 

• 

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the 

disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in 

a manner that achieves fair presentation. 

 

• 

Obtain sufficient appropriate evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business 

activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are 

responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely 

responsible for our audit opinion.

Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements (cont’d) 

 

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 

audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 

during our audit. 

 

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 

regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may 

reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 

 

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most 

significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit 

matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public 

disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not 

be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected 

to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. 

 

 

Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements  

 

In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those 

subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in 

accordance with the provisions of the Act. 

 

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Mr Ng Chiou Gee

General 

 

Polaris Ltd. (the “Company”) is a public limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in 

Singapore and is listed on the Catalist of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited 

(“SGX-ST”). The Company’s registered office and principal place of business is at 81 Ubi Avenue 

4, #03-11, Singapore 408830. 

 

The principal activity of the Company is that of investment holding. The principal activities of the 

subsidiaries are set out in Note 17.

in the current financial year, the Group has adopted all the new and revised standards which are 

relevant to the Group and are effective for annual financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 

2019. 

 

Description 

 

SFRS(I) 16 Leases 

Amendments to SFRS(I) 9 Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation

(a) 

Application of New and Revised Standards and Interpretations (cont’d) 

 

SFRS(I) 16 Leases 

 

SFRS(I) 16 sets out a revised framework for the recognition, measurement, presentation and 

disclosure of leases, and replaces SFRS(I) 1-17 Leases, SFRS(I) INT 4 Determining whether an 

Arrangement contains a Lease, SFRS(I) INT 1-15 Operating Leases – Incentives; and SFRS(I) INT 

1-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. SFRS(I) 16 

requires lessees to recognise right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities for all leases with a 

term of more than 12 months, except where the underlying asset is of low value. The ROU asset is 

depreciated and interest expense is recognised on the lease liability. Lease incentives (e.g. rent-free 

period) are recognised as part of the measurement of the ROU assets and lease liabilities. ROU 

assets are tested for impairment in accordance with SFRS(I) 1-36 Impairment of Assets. The 

accounting requirements for lessors have not been changed substantially, and continue to be based 

on a classification as either operating or finance leases. Disclosure requirements have been enhanced 

for both lessors and lessees.  

 

On 1 January 2019, the Group has applied a modified retrospective approach that does not restate 

comparative information, but recognises the cumulative effect of initially applying SFRS(I) 16 as an 

adjustment to the opening accumulated losses on 1 January 2019. Under the modified retrospective 

approach, the Group has elected to apply the following practical expedients under SFRS(I) 16: 

 

i. 

or all contracts entered into before 1 January 2019 and that were previously identified as 

leases under SFRS(I) 1-17 and SFRS(I) INT 4, the Group is exempted from having to 

reassess whether pre-existing contracts contain a lease. Accordingly, the definition of a lease 

in accordance with SFRS(I) 1-17 and SFRS(I) INT 4 will continue to be applied to leases 

entered or modified before 1 January 2019. 

 

ii. 

The Group has, on a lease-by-lease basis: 

 

• 

applied a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar 

characteristics; 

• 

relied on previous assessments on whether leases are onerous as an alternative to 

performing an impairment review; 

• 

excluded initial direct costs in the measurement of the ROU assets at the date of initial 

application; and 

• 

used hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to 

extend or terminate the lease. 

 

iii. 

The Group has elected not to recognise ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases 

that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. The Group 

recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line 

basis over the lease term.

SFRS(I) 16 Leases (cont’d) 

 

Impact on lessee accounting 

 

For leases previously classified as operating leases, the Group chose to measure its ROU assets 

(except for ROU assets which meet the definition of investment property) at a carrying amount as if 

SFRS(I) 16 had been applied since the commencement of the lease but discounted using the 

incremental borrowing rate at 1 January 2019. The Group recognised its lease liabilities by 

discounting the remaining lease payments as at 1 January 2019 using the incremental borrowing rate 

for each individual lease or, if applicable, the incremental borrowing rate for each portfolio of leases 

with reasonably similar characteristics. The difference between the carrying amounts of the ROU 

assets and lease liabilities as at 1 January 2019 is adjusted directly to opening accumulated losses. 

Comparative information is not restated. 

 

The Group has no leases previously classified as finance leases. 

 

Impact on lessor accounting 

 

There are no significant changes to the accounting by the Group as a lessor. 

 

Financial impact of adoption of SFRS(I) 16 

 

On 1 January 2019, the Group recognised right-of-use assets of approximately S$363,000 and lease 

liabilities of approximately S$390,000, recognising the difference of approximately S$27,000 in 

opening accumulated losses. 

 

When measuring lease liabilities, the Group discounted lease payments using its incremental 

borrowing rate at 1 January 2019. The weighted-average rates applied ranged from 5.25% to 5.80%. 

 

The differences between the operating lease commitments disclosed applying SFRS(I) 1-17 in the 

Group’s financial statements as at 31 December 2018 and the lease liabilities recognised in the 

statement of financial position as at 1 January 2019 are presented below.

New and Revised Standards Issued but Not Yet Effective  

 

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not adopted the following 

new and revised standards applicable to the Group that have been issued but are not yet effective: 

 

Description 

Effective for 

annual periods 

beginning on or after 

 

 

Amendments to SFRS(I) 3: Definition of a Business 

1 January 2020 

Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1 and SFRS(I) 1-8: Definition of Material  

1 January 2020 

Amendments to SFRS(I) 9, SFRS(I) 1-39 and SFRS(I) 7:  

Interest Rate Benchmark Reform 

1 January 2020 

Amendments to SFRS(I) 10 and SFRS(I) 1-28: Sale or Contribution  

of Assets between an Investor and its associate or Joint Venture 

Date to be determined 

 

Except for the amendments to SFRS(I) 3, the Group expects that the adoption of the other new and 

revised standards above will have no material impact on the financial statements in the period of 

initial application. 

 

Amendments to SFRS(I) 3: Definition of a Business 

 

The amendments confirm that a business must include inputs and a process. The amendments also 

clarify that the process must be substantive, and the inputs and process must significantly contribute 

to creating outputs. The revised definition of a business focuses on goods and services provided to 

customers and other income from ordinary activities, rather than on providing dividends or other 

economic benefits directly to investors or lowering costs. A new optional test is available to assess 

whether a business has been acquired, when the value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a 

single asset or group of similar assets. 

 

These amendments are applicable to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or 

after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 January 2020 and to 

asset acquisitions that occur on or after the beginning of that period. Early application is permitted. 

 

The Group does not expect any significant impact arising from applying these amendments.

Significant Accounting Policies 

 

(a) 

Basis of Preparation 

 

The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the 

Company have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act, 

Chapter 50 (the “Act”) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)”). 

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except as disclosed in the 

accounting policies below. 

 

(b) 

Group Accounting 

 

i. 

Subsidiaries 

 

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. 

The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns 

from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its 

power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is 

transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. 

 

The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances 

indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above. 

When the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power 

over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct 

the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. 

 

Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses, represents the excess of the sum of 

the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and 

the acquisition-date fair value of any previously-held equity interest in the acquiree over the 

fair value of the fair value of the investee’s identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill on 

acquisitions of subsidiaries is initially measured at cost. Following initial recognition, 

goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment loss. Gains and losses on the 

disposal of subsidiaries, include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. 

 

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The 

consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets 

transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity 

interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any 

asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets 

acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are 

measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-

controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value 

or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of 

acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 

 

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

Significant Accounting Policies (cont’d) 

 

(b) 

Group Accounting (cont’d) 

 

i. 

Subsidiaries (cont’d) 

 

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the 

acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the 

acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in 

profit or loss. 

 

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at 

the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration 

that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in profit or loss. Contingent 

consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is 

accounted for within equity. 

 

If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously-

held interest measured is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired 

as in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the income 

statement. 

 

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group 

companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction 

provides evidence of an impairment indicator of the transferred assets. When necessary, 

amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform with the Group’s 

accounting policies. 

 

Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted 

for as equity transactions – that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as 

owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share 

acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or 

losses on disposals of interests in subsidiaries to non-controlling interests without loss of 

control are also recorded in equity. 

 

When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, it: 

 

• 

derecognises the assets (including any goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their 

carrying amounts at the date when control is lost; 

• 

derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest (including any 

components of other comprehensive income attributable to them); 

• 

recognises the fair value of the consideration received; 

• 

recognises the fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair 

value; 

• 

re-classifies the Group’s share of components previously recognised in other 

comprehensive income to profit or loss or accumulated losses, as appropriate; and 

• 

recognises any resulting difference in profit or loss.

Group Accounting (cont’d) 

 

ii. 

Associates 

 

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, 

generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.  

 

Goodwill on acquisition of associates represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition 

over the Group’s share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill on 

associates is included in the carrying amount of the investments. Gains and losses on the 

disposal of associates include the carrying amounts of goodwill relating to the entity sold. 

 

Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting less 

impairment losses, if any. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at 

cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of 

the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. 

 

When the Group reduces its ownership interest in an associate, but the Group continues to 

apply the equity method, the Group reclassifies to profit or loss the proportion of the gain or 

loss that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that 

reduction in ownership if that gain or loss would be required to be reclassified to profit or 

loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities. 

 

The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in profit or loss, and its 

share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other 

comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the 

investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest 

in the associate or joint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has 

incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. 

 

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that 

the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the 

amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate 

and its carrying value and recognises the amount in profit or loss. 

 

Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Group 

and its associate are recognised in the Group’s financial statements only to the extent of 

unrelated investor’s interests in the associates. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the 

transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies 

of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies 

adopted by the Group.

Investments in Subsidiaries and Associates 

 

Investments in subsidiaries and associates are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses in 

the statement of financial position of the Company.  

 

On disposal of investments in subsidiaries and associates, the difference between the net disposal 

proceeds and the carrying amount of the investments are recognised in profit or loss. 

 

(d) 

Revenue Recognition 

 

Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in 

exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on 

behalf of third parties. 

 

Revenue is recognised when the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised 

good or service to the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service. 

A performance obligation may be satisfied at a point in time or over time. The amount of revenue 

recognised is the amount allocated to the satisfied performance obligation. 

 

i. 

Distribution sale of mobile handsets and accessories, and trading sale of lifestyle 

products 

 

Revenue from the distribution sale of mobile handsets and accessories, and trading sale of 

lifestyle products is recognised when control of the products has transferred, being when the 

goods are delivered to the customer, the customer has full discretion over the manner of 

distribution and price to sell the goods, and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could 

affect the customer’s acceptance of the goods. Delivery occurs when the goods have been 

shipped to the specific location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to 

the customer, and either the customer has accepted the goods in accordance with the sales 

contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the Group has the objective evidence that 

all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied. A receivable is recognised when the goods are 

delivered as this represents the point in time that the right to consideration is unconditional 

because only the passage of time is required before the payment is due. 

 

ii. 

Retail sale of consumer electronics and related products 

 

The Group operates retail outlet selling electronics and related products. Revenue from the 

retail sale of electronics and related products is recognised when control of the goods has 

transferred, being at the point the customer purchases the goods at the retail outlet. Payment 

of the transaction price is due immediately at the point the customer purchases the goods.

Customer services 

 

The Group provides after-market services to end consumers for equipment repairs and 

technical services. Revenue from customer services is recognised at a point in time when the 

services are rendered. Payment of the transaction price is due immediately at the point the 

customer acknowledges the completion of the services. 

 

(e) 

Government Grants 

 

Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received 

and all attaching conditions will be complied with. 

 

Government grants received are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them 

with the related costs which they are intended to compensate, on a systematic basis. Government 

grants relating to expenses are shown separately as other income. 

 

Government grants relating to assets are deducted against the carrying amount of the assets. 

 

(f) 

Leases 

 

Accounting policies applicable from 1 January 2019 

 

i. 

When the Group is the lessee 

 

At the inception of the contract, the Group assesses if the contract contains a lease. A 

contract contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified 

asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Reassessment is only required when 

the terms and conditions of the contract are changed. 

 

The Group recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at the date which the 

underlying assets become available for use. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, which 

comprises the initial measurement of lease liabilities adjusted for any lease payments made 

at or before the commencement dates, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate 

of restoration costs, less any lease incentives received. Any initial direct costs that would not 

have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained are added to the carrying amount of 

the right-of-use assets.

When the Group is the lessee (cont’d) 

 

Right-of-use assets are subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the 

commencement dates to the earlier of the end of the useful lives of the right-of-use assets or 

the end of the lease terms. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined 

on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment and are disclosed in Note 

3(k)(ii). In addition, the right-of-use assets are periodically reduced by impairment losses, if 

any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the corresponding lease liabilities. The 

Group presents its right-of-use assets (except for those which meets the definition of an 

investment property) in “Property, plant and equipment” and lease liabilities in “Loans and 

borrowings” in the consolidated statement of financial position. Right-of-use assets which 

meet the definition of an investment property are presented within “Investment properties” 

and accounted for in accordance with Note 3(l). 

 

The initial measurement of lease liabilities is measured at the present value of the lease 

payments discounted using the implicit rate in the lease, if the rate can be readily 

determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses its incremental 

borrowing rate. 

 

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: 

 

• 

Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives 

receivables;  

• 

Variable lease payments that are based on an index or rate, initially measured using the 

index or rate as at the commencement date;  

• 

Amounts expected to be payable under residual value guarantees; 

• 

The exercise price of a purchase option if is reasonably certain to exercise the option; 

and  

• 

Payment of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group 

exercising that option. 

 

For contracts that contain both lease and non-lease components, the Group allocates the 

consideration to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-alone price of the 

lease and non-lease components. The Group has elected not to separate lease and non-lease 

components for property leases; instead they are accounted for as one single lease 

component.

i. 

When the Group is the lessee (cont’d) 

 

Lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost, and are remeasured when: 

 

• 

There is a change in future lease payments arising from changes in an index or rate;   

• 

There is a change in the Group’s assessment of whether it will exercise lease extension 

and termination options;   

• 

There is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a 

residual value guarantee; or   

• 

There is a modification to the lease term. 

 

When lease liabilities are remeasured, corresponding adjustments are made against the right-

of-use assets. If the carrying amounts of the right-of-use assets have been reduced to zero, 

the adjustments are recorded in profit or loss. The Group has elected not to recognise right-

of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have lease terms of 12 months or 

less, as well as leases of low value assets, except in the case of sub-lease arrangements. 

Lease payments relating to these leases are expensed to profit or loss on a straight-line basis 

over the lease term. 

 

Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate are included in the 

measurement of the corresponding right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Other variable 

lease payments are recognised in profit or loss when incurred. 

 

ii. 

When the Group is the lessor  

 

Each lease in which the Group acts as a lessor is classified as either an operating or a 

finance lease at lease inception. Leases that transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards 

incidental to ownership of the underlying assets are classified as finance leases. Other leases 

are classified as operating leases. 

 

Lessor - operating leases 

 

Leases of investment properties where the Group retains substantially all risks and rewards 

incidental to ownership are classified as operating leases. Rental income from operating 

leases (net of any incentives given to the lessees) is recognised in income on a straight-line 

basis over the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred by the Group in negotiating and 

arranging operating leases are added to the carrying amount of the leased assets and 

recognised as an expense in profit or loss over the lease term on the same basis as the lease 

income. Contingent rents are recognised as income in profit or loss when earned.

When the Group is the lessee  

 

Lessee - finance leases 

 

Leases where the Group assumes substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership 

of the leased assets are classified as finance leases. 

 

The leased assets and the corresponding lease liabilities (net of finance charges) under 

finance leases are recognised on the combined statement of financial position as property, 

plant and equipment and borrowings respectively, at the inception of the leases based on the 

lower of the fair value of the leased assets and the present value of the minimum lease 

payments. 

 

Each lease payment is apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the 

outstanding lease liability. The finance expense is recognised in profit or loss on a basis that 

reflects a constant periodic rate of interest on the finance lease liability. 

 

Lessee - operating leases 

 

Leases of retail outlet where substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership are 

retained by the lessors are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating 

leases (net of any incentives received from the lessors) are recognised in profit or loss on a 

straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Contingent rents are recognised as an 

expense in profit or loss when incurred.

The Group’s accounting policies as a lessor under SFRS(I) 1-17 are similar to those under

Foreign Currencies 

 

i. 

Functional and presentation currency  

 

The individual financial statements of each entity in the Group are presented in the currency 

of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency). 

 

For the purposes of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position 

of each entity in the Group are expressed in Singapore Dollars (“S$”), which is the 

functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the consolidated 

financial statements. 

 

All values are rounded to the nearest thousand (S$’000) except when otherwise indicated. 

 

ii. 

Transactions and balances 

 

In preparing the financial statements of each individual entity, transactions in currencies 

other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of 

exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 

 

At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are 

retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Currency translation differences resulting 

from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and 

liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the closing rates at the reporting date are 

recognised in profit or loss.  

 

Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are 

retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-

monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not 

retranslated.

Translation of Group entities’ financial statements 

 

The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency 

different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as 

follows: 

 

• 

assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rates at the reporting date; 

• 

income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless the average is not 

a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the 

transactions dates, in which the case income and expenses are translating using the 

exchange rates at the dates of the transactions); and 

• 

all resulting currency translation differences are recognised in other comprehensive 

income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve. 

 

On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a 

foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a 

foreign operation, or a partial disposal of an interest in a joint arrangement or an associate 

that includes a foreign operation of which the retained interest becomes a financial asset), all 

of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to 

the owners of the Company are reclassified to profit or loss.  

 

In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation 

that does not result in the Group losing control over the subsidiary, the proportionate share 

of accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are 

not recognised in profit or loss. For all other partial disposals (i.e. partial disposals of 

associates or joint arrangements that do not result in the Group losing significant influence 

or joint control), the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is 

reclassified to profit or loss.  

 

Goodwill and fair value adjustments to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

through acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 

operation and translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of each reporting 

period. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income. 

 

(h) 

Borrowing Costs 

 

All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

(i) 

Employee Benefits 

 

Employee benefits are recognised as an expense in profit or loss, unless the cost qualifies to be 

capitalised as an asset. 

 

i. 

Defined contribution plans 

 

Defined contribution plans are post-employment benefit plans under which the Group pays 

fixed contributions into separate entities such as the Central Provident Fund on a mandatory, 

contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the 

contributions have been paid. 

 

Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense 

when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions. 

 

ii. 

Employee leave entitlement 

 

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised as a liability when they accrue to 

employees. A provision for the estimated liability for annual leave is recognised for services 

rendered by employees up to the reporting date. 

 

(j) 

Income Tax  

 

Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 

 

i. 

Current tax 

 

Current income tax for current and prior periods is recognised at the amount expected to be 

paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been 

enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting date. The Group periodically 

evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 

regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions, where appropriate, on the 

basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. 

 

ii. 

Deferred tax 

 

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets 

and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the 

computation of taxable profit. 

 

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. 

Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the 

extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible 

temporary differences can be utilised.

ii. 

Deferred tax (cont’d) 

 

Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises 

from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 

assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting 

profit. 

 

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with 

investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the 

reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 

reverse in the foreseeable future. 

 

Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such 

investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will 

be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences 

and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. 

 

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period 

and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be 

available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 

 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in 

the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax 

laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. 

 

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that 

would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting 

period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. 

 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set 

off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes 

levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets 

and liabilities on a net basis. 

 

The Group recognises a previously unrecognised deferred tax asset to the extent that it has 

become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items 

that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the 

current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 

equity respectively. Where the current and deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for 

a business combination, the tax effect is taken into account in the accounting for the 

business combination. 

 

(k) 

Property, Plant and Equipment 

 

i. 

Measurement 

 

All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost and subsequently 

carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.  

 

The cost includes its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset 

to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner 

intended by management. Dismantlement, removal or restoration costs are included as part 

of the cost if the obligation for dismantlement, removal or restoration is incurred as a 

consequence of acquiring or using the property, plant and equipment. 

 

ii. 

Depreciation  

 

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost less their residual values over their 

useful lives, using the straight-line method.  

 

The following useful lives are used in the calculation of depreciation: 

 

Commercial properties 

30 years 

Furniture, fixtures and renovation 

3 to 5 years 

Office equipment and computers 

3 to 5 years 

Retail outlet 

3 years 

Motor vehicles 

2 years 

 

The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when 

events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 

 

The residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each financial year 

and adjusted as appropriate at each reporting date. The effects of any revision are recognised 

in profit or loss when the changes arise.

Subsequent expenditure 

 

Subsequent expenditure related to property, plant and equipment that has been recognised is 

added to the carrying amount of the asset only when it is probable that future economic 

benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost can be measured 

reliably. All other repair and maintenance expenses are recognised in profit or loss when 

incurred. 

 

iv. 

Disposal 

 

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future 

economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. 

 

The gain or loss arising on disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and 

equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 

amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss. 

 

(l) 

Investment Properties 

 

Investment properties, which are properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation, are 

measured initially at cost and subsequently carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and 

accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated using a straight-line method to allocate 

the depreciable amount over the estimated useful life of 30 years. The residual value, useful life and 

depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate 

accounted for on a prospective basis. The effect of any revision are recognised in profit or loss when 

the changes arise. 

 

Investment properties are subject to renovations or improvements at regular intervals. The cost of 

major renovations and improvements is capitalised and the carrying amounts of the replaced 

components are recognised in profit or loss. All other costs of maintenance, repairs and minor 

improvements are recognised in profit or loss when incurred. 

 

Investment properties are derecognised when either they have been disposed of or when the asset is 

permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. Any 

gain or loss on the retirement or disposal of an investment property, calculated as the difference 

between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in profit or loss 

in the year of retirement or disposal.

Intangible Assets 

 

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured initially at cost or acquired in a business 

combination are identified and recognised separately from goodwill at their fair value at the 

acquisition date. Intangible assets are subsequently stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 

accumulated impairment losses. 

 

The carrying amounts of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 

circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 

 

The useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any 

changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. The effect of any revision are recognised 

in profit or loss when the changes arise. 

 

Intangible assets are derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected 

from its use or disposal. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is 

determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is 

included in profit or loss in the period in which the asset is derecognised. 

 

(n) 

Impairment of Non-Financial Assets  

 

Non-financial assets (including finite intangible assets) are tested for impairment whenever there is 

any indication that these assets may be impaired. 

 

At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial 

assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment 

loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to 

determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any), on an individual asset. 

 

Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group 

estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Where a 

reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to 

individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-

generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. 

 

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing 

value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 

discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 

specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

Impairment of Non-Financial Assets (cont’d) 

 

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its 

carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its 

recoverable amount.  

 

The difference between the carrying amount and recoverable amount is recognised as an impairment 

loss in profit or loss.  

 

An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously 

recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. 

 

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-

generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the 

increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined 

had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A 

reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 

 

(o) 

Financial Assets 

 

Classification 

 

i. 

Debt instruments 

 

Financial assets that are debt instruments comprise mainly of cash and cash equivalents, 

trade and other receivables, and investments in debt securities. The Group classifies these 

assets into categories based on the Group’s business model for managing them and their 

contractual cash flow characteristics. 

 

• 

Financial Assets measured at Amortised Cost (“AC”) comprise of assets that are held 

within a business model whose objective is to hold those assets for collection of 

contractual cash flows, and those contractual cash flows represent solely payments of 

principal and interest. 

 

• 

Financial Assets measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income 

(“FVOCI”) comprise of assets that are held within a business model whose objective is 

achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling those assets, and those 

contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. 

 

• 

Financial Assets measured at Fair Value through Profit and loss (“FVPL”) comprise of 

assets that do not qualify for AC and FVOCI. Assets that would otherwise qualify for 

AC or FVOCI may also be designated as FVPL upon initial recognition, if such 

designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition 

inconsistency that arises from measuring assets and liabilities on an inconsistent basis.

Classification (cont’d) 

 

ii. 

Equity instruments 

 

Financial assets that are equity instruments comprise mainly of investments in equity 

securities. The Group classifies these assets as FVPL, except for those that the Group has 

designated as FVOCI. The FVOCI designation is irrevocable, and is not permitted for held-

for-trading financial assets and financial assets that represent contingent consideration in a 

business combination. 

 

A financial asset is held for trading if: 

 

• 

it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling it in the near term; or 

• 

on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the 

Group manages together and has evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-

taking; or 

• 

it is a derivative (except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract or a 

designated and effective hedging instrument). 

 

Initial measurement 

 

Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are initially 

recognised at their transaction price. Other financial assets are initially recognised at fair 

value, plus, for financial assets that are not at FVPL, transaction costs that are directly 

attributable to their acquisition.  

 

Transaction costs of financial assets at FVPL are expensed in profit and loss. 

 

Subsequent measurement 

 

i. 

Debt instruments 

 

AC 

 

These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method 

unless they are part of a designated hedging relationship. Impairment losses and reversals, 

interest income, and foreign exchange gains and losses (except where designated as a 

hedging instrument) on such assets are recognised in profit and loss. Interest income is 

based on the effective interest method which allocates interest income over the life of the 

financial asset based on an effective interest rate that discounts estimated future cash 

receipts to its gross carrying amount.

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Impairment losses and reversals, 

interest income based on the effective interest method, and foreign exchange gains and 

losses (except where designated as a hedging instrument) on such assets are recognised in 

profit and loss. Any remaining fair value movements are recorded in OCI. 

 

FVPL 

 

These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. All fair value movements are recorded 

in profit and loss. 

 

ii. 

Equity instruments 

 

Subsequent to initial recognition, all equity investments are measured at fair value. Changes 

in the fair value of FVPL equity investments are recognised in profit and loss, while changes 

in the fair value of FVOCI equity investments are recognised in other comprehensive 

income. All dividend income is recognised in profit and loss, except for dividends from 

FVOCI equity investments that clearly represent a recovery of the cost of investment. 

 

Impairment 

 

At each reporting date, the Group assesses expected credit losses (“ECL”) on the following 

financial instruments: 

 

• 

Financial assets that are debt instruments measured at AC and FVOCI; 

• 

Contract assets (as defined in SFRS(I) 15); and 

• 

Financial guarantee contracts.

Significant Accounting Policies (cont’d)

Financial Assets (cont’d) 

 

Impairment (cont’d) 

 

ECL is a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured at the 

present value of all shortfalls between the cash flows due to the Group in accordance with 

contractual terms, and the cash flows that the Group actually expects to receive. ECL is 

discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset. The Group records allowances 

on financial assets based on either the: 

 

• 

12-month ECL – representing the ECL that results from default events that are possible 

within the 12 months after the reporting date (or the expected life of the instrument if 

shorter); or 

• 

Lifetime ECL – representing the ECL that results from all possible default events over 

the expected life of the contract. 

 

Simplified approach - Trade receivables 

 

For all trade receivables, the Group adopts a simplified approach whereby an allowance for 

lifetime ECL is assessed upon initial recognition. The Group estimates lifetime ECL using a 

provision matrix based on historical credit loss experience, adjusted for various factors 

including debtor-specific factors, forward-looking information such as industry and 

economic forecasts, and others as appropriate. 

 

General approach – All other financial instruments on which ECL assessment is required 

 

For all other financial instruments on which ECL is assessed, an allowance for 12-month 

ECL is recorded upon initial recognition. The allowance is increased to lifetime ECL if the 

credit risk at each reporting date has increased significantly as compared to the credit risk at 

initial recognition. In assessing whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has 

increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group considers all reasonable and 

supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort including 

both historical credit experience and forward-looking information. 

 

The Group regards the following as events of default: 

 

• 

Events that make it unlikely for the borrower to repay in full unless the Group 

undertakes actions to recover the asset (e.g. by exercising rights over collaterals or other 

credit enhancements); or 

• 

The financial instrument has become overdue in excess of 1 year.

Financial Assets (cont’d) 

 

Impairment (cont’d) 

 

Credit-impaired financial instruments 

 

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether a financial instrument on which ECL 

assessment is required has become credit-impaired. This is the case when one or more 

events have occurred that are considered to be detrimental to the estimated future cash flows 

of the instrument. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes observable data 

about the following events: 

 

• 

significant financial difficulty of the borrower; 

• 

a breach of contract such as a default or past due event (e.g. being more than 90 days 

past due); 

• 

other lenders granting concessions (such as loan restructurings) to the borrower due to 

economic or contractual reasons, that would not have been considered in the absence of 

the borrower’s financial difficulty; 

• 

increasing likelihood that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial re-

organisation; and 

• 

the disappearance of an active market for the borrower’s securities due to financial 

difficulties. 

 

For credit-impaired financial assets, interest income is determined by applying the effective 

interest rate to the net carrying amount of the financial asset (after deduction of the ECL 

allowance). 

 

Write-off policy 

 

The Group writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the 

counterparty is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, 

such as when the counterparty has been placed under liquidation or has entered into 

bankruptcy proceedings. Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement 

activities under the Group’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where 

appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in profit and loss.

Significant Accounting Policies (cont’d) 

 

(o) 

Financial Assets (cont’d) 

 

Recognition and derecognition 

 

Financial assets are recognised when, and only when the Group becomes a party to its 

contractual provisions. All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are 

recognised on trade-date, which is the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell 

the asset. 

 

The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows 

from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks 

and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party. If the Group neither transfers nor 

retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the 

transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated 

liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and 

rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the 

financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. 

 

On derecognition of a financial asset that is a debt instrument, the difference between the 

asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is 

recognised in profit and loss. In addition, for a financial asset that is a debt instrument at 

FVOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the fair value adjustment 

reserve is reclassified to profit and loss. 

 

On derecognition of an equity investment at FVPL, the difference between the asset’s 

carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognised in 

profit and loss. For equity investments at FVOCI, this difference is instead recognised 

directly in equity as part of accumulated losses. Cumulative gains and losses previously 

accumulated in equity are also transferred directly to accumulated losses upon derecognition 

of FVOCI equity investments. 

 

(p) 

Offsetting of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 

 

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the combined 

statement of financial position, when and only when, there is a currently enforceable legal right to 

set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets 

and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

(q) 

Provisions 

 

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result 

of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable 

estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 

 

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the 

present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties 

surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle 

the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect 

of the time value of money is material). 

 

When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be 

recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that 

reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. 

 

(r) 

Financial Liabilities 

 

i. 

Financial liabilities 

 

The Group recognises financial liabilities on its statement of financial position when, and 

only when, the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. 

 

Financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs that are 

directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial liability. All financial 

liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 

 

Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value (net of transaction costs) and subsequently 

carried at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and 

the redemption value is recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using 

the effective interest method. Borrowings are presented as current liabilities unless the 

Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the 

reporting period. An entity shall recognise a financial liability on its statement of financial 

position when, and only when, the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 

the instrument.

The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations 

are discharged, cancelled or they have expired. The difference between the carrying amount 

of a financial liability that has been derecognised and the consideration paid and payable 

(including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or 

loss. 

 

(s) 

Related Parties 

 

A related party is defined as follows: 

 

A related party is a person or entity that is related to the entity that is preparing its financial 

statements (in this Standard referred to as the “reporting entity”). 

 

a. 

A person or a close member of that person’s family is related to a reporting entity if that 

person: 

 

i. 

has control or joint control over the reporting entity; 

ii. 

has significant influence over the reporting entity; or 

iii. 

is a member of the key management personnel of the reporting entity or of a parent 

of the reporting entity. 

 

b. 

An entity is related to a reporting entity if any of the following conditions applies: 

 

i. 

the entity and the reporting entity are members of the same group (which means that 

each parent, subsidiary and fellow subsidiary is related to the others); 

ii. 

one entity is an associate or joint venture of the other entity (or an associate or joint 

venture of a member of a group of which the other entity is a member); 

iii. 

both entities are joint ventures of the same third party; 

iv. 

one entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate of 

the third entity; 

v. 

the entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of either 

the reporting entity or an entity related to the reporting entity. If the reporting entity 

is itself such a plan, the sponsoring employers are also related to the reporting 

entity; 

vi. 

the entity is controlled or jointly controlled by a person identified in (a); 

vii. 

a person identified in (a)(i) has significant influence over the entity or is a member 

of the key management personnel of the entity (or of a parent of the entity); or 

viii. 

the entity, or any member of a group of which it is a part, provides key management 

personnel services to the reporting entity or to the parent of the reporting entity.

Inventories 

 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of finished goods 

comprises direct costs that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location 

and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents 

the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the 

sale. Allowance for stock obsolescence is made for obsolete and slow-moving inventories.   

 

(u) 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

 

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, fixed deposits, bank balances and short-term, 

highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are 

subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. For the purpose of presentation in the 

consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents 

as defined above less pledged fixed deposits. 

 

(v) 

Share Capital 

 

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of 

new ordinary shares are charged to equity, net of any tax effects. 

 

(w) 

Segment Reporting 

 

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the 

executive management whose members are responsible for allocating resources and assessing 

performance of the operating segments. 

 

(x) 

Non-current Assets Held-for-sale and Discontinued Operations 

 

Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held-for-sale or distribution if their carrying 

amount will be recovered through a sale transaction or distribution rather than through continuing 

use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or 

disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be 

committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale 

within one year from the date of classification. 

 

When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the 

assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held-for-sale when the criteria set out above 

are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling interest in its former 

subsidiary after the sale. Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held-for-sale (held for 

distribution) are measured at the lower of the assets’ previous carrying amount and fair value less 

cost to sell (fair value less costs to distribute).

Non-current Assets Held-for-sale and Discontinued Operations (cont’d) 

 

The assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held-for-sale. In addition, 

equity accounting of associates and joint ventures ceases once classified as held-for-sale. Any 

impairment loss on initial classification and subsequent measurement is recognised as an expense. 

Any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell (not exceeding the accumulated impairment 

loss that has been previously recognised) is recognised in profit or loss. 

 

A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of, or that is 

classified as held for sale and; 

 

i. 

represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or 

ii. 

is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or 

geographical area of operations; or 

iii. 

is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. 

 

When a component of an entity qualifies as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of 

comprehensive income is retrospectively restated to segregate the results of all operations that have 

been discontinued by the end of the latest reporting period. 

 

 

44 

Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty 

 

The preparation of financial statements and the application of the Group’s accounting policies, 

which are set out in Note 3 above, requires management to make judgements, estimates and 

assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the 

disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of each reporting period. The estimates and associated 

assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. 

Uncertainty about these estimates and assumptions could result in outcomes that require a material 

adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in the future periods.

Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty (cont’d) 

 

(a) 

Critical Judgements in Applying the Accounting Policies 

 

i. 

Impairment of investments in subsidiaries 

 

Management reviews the Company’s investments in subsidiaries at each reporting date to 

determine whether there is any indication that the investment may be impaired. To 

determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment, management considers factors 

such as the subsidiaries’ financial performance and financial position and the overall 

economic environment. If any indicator exists, an impairment assessment will be performed 

accordingly. 

 

The carrying amount of the Company’s investments in subsidiaries and the allowance for 

impairment loss are disclosed in Note 17. 

 

(b) 

Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty 

 

i. 

Loss allowance for trade receivables 

 

The Group measures the loss allowance for trade receivables and contract assets at an 

amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses (“ECLs”). The ECLs on trade receivables 

are estimated using a provision matrix which involves grouping receivables based on 

characteristics which have historically influenced asset recoverability, such as credit ratings, 

customer-industry group and customer geography, and applying a historic provision rate 

which is based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have 

similar loss patterns. In devising such a provision matrix, the Group uses its historical credit 

loss experience with forward-looking information (adjusted as necessary to reflect current 

conditions and forecast economic conditions) to estimate the lifetime expected credit losses 

on the trade receivables. At every reporting date, the historical default rates are updated and 

the impact of forward-looking information is re-analysed. 

 

The assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast 

economic conditions and ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs is sensitive to 

changes in circumstances and of forecast economic conditions. The Group’s historical credit 

loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of 

customer’s actual default in the future.  

 

Information about the ECLs on the Group’s trade receivables is disclosed in Note 33(a) and 

the carrying amount of the Group’s trade receivables is disclosed in Note 20.

Investments in Subsidiaries (cont’d) 

 

Impairment loss of subsidiaries 

 

In the previous financial year, an additional allowance for impairment loss of S$675,000 had been 

recognised for the Company’s investment in a partially owned subsidiary, Polaris KKC Holdings 

Pte. Ltd.. The allowance for the impairment loss was the estimated irrecoverable amount of the 

Company’s investment in the subsidiary, determined by reference to its financial position which in 

the opinion of the management, represented the fair value of the Company’s investment in the 

subsidiary. 

 

In the current financial year, the Company has voluntary liquidated Polaris KKC Holdings Pte. Ltd., 

and accordingly, the related allowance amount of S$2,938,000 was written off from the allowance 

account. Further, there is no additional impairment in respect of the Company’s investments in 

subsidiaries as at 31 December 2019.

Quoted equity investment 

 

 

 

PT Trikomsel Oke Tbk. (“TRIO”) 

- 

46,184 

 

 

 

 

The above equity investment represents the Group’s 8.22% investment in TRIO. TRIO’s shares are 

listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (“IDX”). 

 

As per the Group’s investment policy, this investment in equity instrument is not held for trading. 

Instead, it is held mainly for long-term strategic purposes. Accordingly, this investment is 

designated at FVOCI as the management believes that recognising short-term fluctuations in this 

investment’s FVPL would not be consistent with the Group’s strategy of holding this investment for 

long-term purposes. 

 

During the financial year ended 31 December 2018, the prolonged suspension of TRIO’s shares on 

the IDX since 6 January 2016 was removed and trading of its shares had resumed. The fair value of 

the quoted equity investment was accordingly based on quoted prices on the IDX at the reporting 

date which is categorised under Level 1 of the Fair Value Hierarchy (defined in Note 33(f)). 

 

During the financial year ended 31 December 2019, the TRIO’s shares on the IDX were suspended 

in July 2019 and remained suspended at the reporting date. As TRIO’s shares remained suspended, 

management has relied on information about prices from recent off-market transactions after the 

year end in the determination of the fair value at the reporting date which is categorised under Level 

2 of the Fair Value Hierarchy. Further, TRIO has announced on 13 March 2020 that under the 

relevant exchange regulations, the IDX may delist TRIO’s shares if it remains to be suspended for a 

continuous period of 24 months.

(a) 

Trade receivables 

 

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and the credit period ranges from 30 to 90 days (2018: 30 

to 90 days). 

 

Loss allowance for trade receivables is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit 

losses (“ECL”) as disclosed in the accounting policy Note 3(o). There has been no change in the 

estimation techniques or significant assumptions made during the current reporting period. None of 

the trade receivables that have been written off is subject to enforcement activities. 

 

The Group’s credit risk exposure in relation to trade receivables are set out in the provision matrix as 

presented below. The Group’s provision for loss allowance is based on past due as the Group’s 

historical credit loss experience does not show significantly different loss patterns for different 

customer segments.

Amounts due from subsidiaries are non-trade, unsecured, non-interest bearing, and are to be settled 

in cash on demand. The Company does not expect to recall the above amounts due from subsidiaries 

within the next 12 months from the financial year end. An additional allowance for impairment loss 

of S$690,000 (2018: S$1,170,000) was recognised for the current financial year. 

 

(c) 

Impairment loss on financial assets 

 

For purpose of impairment assessment, the other receivables (exclude trade receivables and amounts 

due from subsidiaries) are considered to have low credit risk as they are not due for payment at the 

end of the reporting period and there has been no significant increase in the risk of default on the 

receivables since initial recognition. Accordingly, for the purpose of impairment assessment for 

these receivables, the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECL which 

reflects the low credit risk of the exposures. There is no allowance arising from these outstanding 

balances as the expected credit losses are insignificant. There has been no change in the estimation 

techniques or significant assumptions made during the current reporting period in assessing the loss 

allowance for these financial assets.

During the previous financial year ended 31 December 2018, the Group/Company had committed to 

sell one of its commercial properties and all of its investment properties. Accordingly, the net 

carrying amounts of these properties which were previously under “Property, Plant and Equipment” 

and “Investment Properties”, respectively, were reclassified to “Assets Held-for-Sale” at the lower 

of the properties’ previous carrying amounts and fair value less cost to sell. 

 

Management has extended the initial one-year period for another year to complete the sale of the 

properties. The Group/Company remains committed to its plan to sell the properties and 

management has taken the necessary actions in response to the current market conditions and 

continues to actively market the properties at prices that are reasonable, under the current market 

conditions. 

 

Subsequent to the financial year end, the Group/Company has granted an option to a third party 

purchaser to purchase one of these properties. Further details are disclosed in Note 36.

Lease Liabilities (cont’d) 

 

The Group as a lessor 

 

(a) 

Nature of the Group’s/Company’s leasing activities 

 

The Group/Company leased out certain of its assets held-for-sale under operating leases with lease 

terms of 2 years. The lessees do not have an option to purchase the property at the expiry of the lease 

period. Where considered necessary to reduce credit risk, the Group obtained security deposits for 

the term of the leases. These leases are classified as operating lease because the risk and rewards 

incidental to ownership of the assets are not substantially transferred. 

 

Rental income from these leasing activities is disclosed in Note 7. 

 

Future minimum rental receivables under non-cancellable operating leases at the end of the 

reporting period are as follows:

Financial Risk Management 

 

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies 

 

The Group is exposed to financial risks arising from its operations. The key financial risks include 

credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and market risk. 

 

Financial risk management is carried out by management under policies approved by the Board of 

Directors of the Company. The Board of Directors is responsible for setting the objectives and 

underlying principles of financial risk management of the Group. 

 

(a) 

Credit Risk 

 

Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting 

in a loss to the Group. The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises primarily from trade and other 

receivables, refundable deposits, amounts dues from subsidiaries, and cash and bank balances. For 

other financial assets (including cash and bank balances), the Group minimises credit risk by dealing 

exclusively with high credit rating counterparties. 

 

The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties. The Group 

performs ongoing credit evaluation of its counterparties’ financial condition and generally do not 

require a collateral. 

 

The Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there 

has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period. 

 

The Group has determined the default event on a financial asset to be when internal and/or external 

information indicates that the financial asset is unlikely to be received, which could include default 

of contractual payments due for more than one year and nine months or there is significant difficulty 

of the counterparty.

The Group does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements to cover its credit risk 

associated with its financial assets. 

 

Trade receivables 

 

As disclosed in Note 3(o), the Group uses a provision matrix to measure the lifetime expected credit 

loss allowance for trade receivables. In measuring the expected credit losses, trade receivables are 

grouped based on their shared credit risk characteristics and numbers of days past due. The expected 

credit losses on these financial assets are estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group’s 

historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general 

economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of 

conditions at the reporting date, including time value of money where appropriate. 

 

Further details on the loss allowance of the Group’s credit risk exposure in relation to the trade 

receivables is disclosed in Note 20.

(a) 

Credit Risk (cont’d) 

 

Cash and bank balances and other financial assets 

 

The cash and bank balances are entered into with bank and financial institution counterparties, 

which the Group considers to have low credit risk based on external credit agency ratings. 

 

Impairment on cash and bank balances has been measured on the 12-month expected loss basis and 

reflects the short maturities of the exposures. The Group considers that its cash and bank balances 

have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties. The Group uses a 

similar approach for assessment of ECLs for cash and bank balances to those used for debt 

investments. The amount of the allowance on cash and bank balances was insignificant. 

 

Credit risk grading guideline 

 

The Group’s management has established the Group’s internal credit risk grading to the different 

exposures according to their degree of default risk. The internal credit risk grading which are used to 

report the Group’s credit risk exposure to key management personnel for credit risk management 

purposes are as follows: 

 

 

Internal rating grades 

Definition 

Basis of recognition 

of expected credit 

loss (“ECL”) 

 

 

 

 

 

i.   Performing 

The counterparty has a low risk of default and does not 

have any past-due amounts. 

12-month ECL 

 

 

 

 

 

ii.  Under-performing 

There has been a significant increase in credit risk since 

initial recognition (i.e. interest and/or principal 

repayment are more than 30 days past due). 

Lifetime ECL (not 

credit-impaired) 

 

 

 

 

 

iii. Non-performing 

There is evidence indicating that the asset is credit-

impaired (i.e. interest and/or principal repayments are 

more than one year past due). 

Lifetime ECL (credit 

impaired) 

 

 

 

 

 

iv. Write-off 

There is evidence indicating that there is no reasonable 

expectation of recovery as the debtor is in severe 

financial difficulty.

Liquidity Risk 

 

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting 

financial obligations due to shortage of funds. The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to liquidity 

risk arises primarily from mismatches of the maturities of financial assets and liabilities. The 

Group’s and the Company’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and 

flexibility through the use of stand-by credit facilities. 

 

To manage liquidity risk, the Group monitors its net operating cash flow, maintains a level of cash 

and bank balances and secured committed funding facilities from financial institutions. In assessing 

the adequacy of these facilities, the Group reviews working capital and capital expenditure 

requirements continually so as to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in the cash flows. When a 

potential shortfall in cash is anticipated, the Group will finance the shortfall by way of borrowings, 

share placements and/or issue of convertible securities in a timely manner. The Group places its 

surplus funds with reputable banks. 

 

The Group will continue to review, formulate and implement a liquidity risk management policy and 

to maintain sufficient liquid financial assets and stand-by credit facilities with three different banks. 

At the end of the reporting period, approximately 5% (2018: 5%) of the Group’s loans and 

borrowings (Note 24) will mature in less than one year based on the carrying amounts reflected in 

the financial statements.

(c) 

Interest Rate Risk 

 

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group’s and the Company’s 

financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s and the 

Company’s exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from their loans and borrowings. 

 

As the Group’s and Company’s loans and borrowings are presently on floating rates, the Group and 

Company will continue to review, formulate and implement policies to manage interest costs for 

new loans and borrowings using a mix of fixed and floating rate debts. 

 

Sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk 

 

At the end of the reporting period, if the interest rates have been 100 (2018: 100) basis points 

higher/lower with all other variables held constant, the Group’s results for the financial year would 

not be materially affected as a result of higher/lower interest expenses on floating rate loans and 

borrowings.

Foreign Currency Risk 

 

The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from sales or purchases that are 

denominated in foreign currencies; consequently exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. The 

foreign currencies in which these transactions are denominated are mainly United States Dollars 

(“USD”). 

 

To manage the foresaid foreign currency risk, the Group maintains a natural hedge, whenever 

possible, by depositing foreign currency proceeds from sales into foreign currency bank accounts 

which are primarily used for payments of purchases in the same currency denomination.

If the following currencies strengthens by 5% (2018: 5%) against S$ at the reporting date, with all

follows:

A 5% weakening of S$ against the above currencies would have had the equal but opposite effect on 

the above currency to the amount shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant. 

 

The Company has not disclosed its exposure to foreign currency risk as the Company’s risk 

exposure is not significant.

Financial Risk Management (cont’d)

(e) 

Market Risk 

 

Market price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group’s financial 

instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than interest or exchange 

rates). The Group is exposed to equity price arising from its equity investment. 

 

Sensitivity analysis for market risk 

 

The sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to equity price risks at the end of 

the reporting period. 

 

The Group’s equity investment is listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (“IDX”). A 5% change in 

the equity price of the IDX listed equity investment measured at FVOCI would not result in a 

material variance in the fair value of the equity investment at the reporting date (2018: S$2,309,000). 

 

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the TRIO’s shares on the IDX remain 

suspended. 

 

(f) 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

 

The Group has established a control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. This 

framework includes the finance team that reports directly to the Group’s key management, and has 

overall responsibility for all significant fair value measurements, including Level 3 fair values. 

 

The finance team regularly reviews significantly unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If 

third party confirmation, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair value, 

then the finance team assesses and documents the evidence obtained from the third parties to support 

the conclusion that such valuations meet the requirements of SFRS(I)s, including the level in the fair 

value hierarchy the resulting fair value estimate should be classified. 

 

Significant valuation issues are reported to the Company’s Audit and Risk Management Committee.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments (cont’d) 

 

Fair Value Hierarchy 

 

The financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are 

required disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement 

hierarchy: 

 

i. 

Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 

 

ii. 

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the 

asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 

 

iii. 

Level 3 - Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data 

(unobservable inputs). 

 

Fair value measurements that use inputs of different hierarchy levels are categorised in its entirety in 

the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire 

measurement. 

 

Information relating to the Group’s equity investment measured at FVOCI is disclosed in Note 19. 

 

The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with a maturity of less than one year, 

which are primarily cash and bank balances, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, 

and short-term loans and borrowings, are assumed to approximate their carrying amounts because of 

the short-term maturity of these financial instruments. 

 

The fair values of non-current other receivables and long-term loans and borrowings are calculated 

based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows. The discount rates used are 

based on market rates for similar instruments at the reporting date. The carrying amounts of these 

financial assets and financial liabilities are assumed to approximate their respective fair values. The 

Group does not anticipate that the carrying amounts recorded at the reporting date would be 

significantly different from the values that would eventually be received or settled.

Capital Management 

 

Capital includes debt and equity items as disclosed in the table below. 

 

The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong 

credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholders’ 

value. 

 

The Group manages its capital structure and make adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic 

conditions. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the financial years 

ended 31 December 2019 and 2018. 

 

The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net 

debt. The Group will continue to review, formulate and implement policies to keep gearing ratio 

below 50%. The Group includes within net debt, loans and borrowings, trade and other payables less 

cash and bank balances.

Segment Information 

 

For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on their products and 

services, and has the following reportable operating segments: 

 

I. 

The distribution segment engages in the distribution of mobile handsets and accessories for 

leading brands. 

 

II. 

The trading sale of lifestyle products segment engages in the importing and exporting of the 

wholesale and retail of premium lifestyle products. 

 

III. 

The retail consumer electronics segment engages in the retail sale of consumer electronics 

and related products in Singapore. 

 

IV. 

The customer services segment provides after-market services to end consumers for 

equipment repairs and technical services in Singapore. 

 

V. 

The corporate segment is involved in Group-level corporate services, treasury functions, 

investments and in marketable securities. It also involves in strategic investment and joint 

venture opportunities in emerging Southeast Asia markets to synergise and complement the 

Group’s existing offerings. 

 

Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of 

making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is 

evaluated based on operating profit or loss which in certain respects, as explained in the table below, 

is measured differently from operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements. Group 

financing (including finance costs) and income taxes are managed on a group basis and are not 

allocated to operating segments. 

 

The accounting policies of the reportable operating segments are the same as described in Note 3. 

Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm length’s basis in a manner similar to 

transactions with third parties.
