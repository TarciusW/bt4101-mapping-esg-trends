Board Statement 

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) is pleased to present the Group’s Sustainability 

Report (the “Report”) for financial year ended 31 December 2019 (“FY2019”).  

The Report highlights the key Economic, Environmental, Social and Governance 

(“EESG”) related initiatives carried out by the Group for FY2019. It further re-affirms 

the Group’s ongoing efforts on managing and collaborating with our business partners 

on sustainability issues to enhance the Group’s economic, environmental and social 

objectives.  

The Board oversees the identification, management and monitoring of material 

sustainability topics by Management and takes them into consideration in determining 

the Group’s overall strategy, objectives and operations.  

The Board strongly believes that creating sustainable development and value for the 

Group and its stakeholders is an integral part of the Group’s strategy and operations.  

We continue to focus on improving the material sustainability topics, deemed material 

to our business and stakeholders, namely Health and Safety; Training and Education; 

Economic Performance and Reducing Energy Consumption, which we had identified 

in our first-year and second-year reports for financial years ended 31 December 2017 

(“FY2017”) and 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”). However, in light of the evolving Covid-

19 situation, Training and Education may have to be deferred for the time being in view 

of the risks involved and until the situation stabilises, except for mandatory training 

required by the authorities. 

The Board would like to take the opportunity to thank all stakeholders who have 

contributed to our sustainability effort and will continue to strive and improve our 

products and services to our customers while considering the social and environmental 

impact to our stakeholders. The Board will also continue to take a balanced approach 

towards formulating strategies and policies which are sustainable and enhance long-

term values for our stakeholders. 

 

 

On behalf of the Board,

Explanations will be provided should there be any variations. 

 

The Board manages potential risks through the review and approval of policies and 

procedures. Management then ensures that the identified risks are relevant to the 

business environment and hence ensuring controls or mitigating factors are in place.

the effectiveness of the risk management process. 

 

The Board comprises Directors who provide core competencies in accounting and 

finance, business experience, industry knowledge, strategic planning, legal knowledge 

and customer-based experience and knowledge. Where appropriate, the Directors are

Stakeholder Engagement &amp; Materiality Assessment 

 

In developing the Report, the Steering Committee worked with both internal and 

external stakeholders to conduct a materiality assessment to identify the relevant 

EESG topics which the Group considered important. Stakeholders includes 

shareholders, suppliers, customers, management and employees.  

 

The material topics were evaluated for its potential impact on the environment and 

society, its influence on the stakeholders and impact on the Group’s operations. Based 

on the Group’s assessment where there were no significant changes in the business 

and the operating environment, the Board is of the opinion that the materiality 

assessment from FY2018 continues to be valid and relevant for the Group in FY2019. 

 

As part of its ongoing engagements with key stakeholders, the Group carries out the 

following approaches:

Feedback from our key stakeholders form a crucial part of our strategic and business 

planning and is viewed as valuable insights for the Group to continuously improve its 

sustainability performance. 

 

The Steering Committee aims to conduct an annual review of the Group’s material 

topics as well as monitor the performance of the topics as part of the Group’s 

sustainability strategy. 

 

The Group adopts a four-step process to define the material topics: 

 

 

 

 

Material Topics and Boundaries 

 

The topics reported in the FY2018 Sustainability Report were re-evaluated by the 

Steering Committee and all topics were deemed to be material to the Group for FY2019. 

As such, the Steering Committee recommended to the Board the same topics to be 

the material topics to be reported in FY2019. 

 

Material Topics

Economic Performance (GRI 201-1) 

 

Economic performance is defined as our most material topic because our economic 

success ensures our long-term viability and enables the execution of our sustainability 

strategies. 

For FY2019, the Group recorded a profit after tax of S$1.55 million as compared with 

a profit after tax of S$1.14 million for FY2018. 

For FY2019, the Group is in a healthy financial position with revenue of S$4.79 million 

and is in a net equity position of S$29.79 million as compared to revenue of S$5.02 

million and net equity of S$29.53 million for FY2018. 

For a detailed breakdown of our FY2019 financial results, please refer to the Group’s 

Annual Report for FY2019. 

 

Reducing Energy Usage for Production (GRI 302-1) 

 

The Group recognises the importance of properly managing and regulating energy 

consumption so as to keep operational costs low and also to reduce the impact on the 

environment. As such, this topic is deemed to be material to the Group. To keep track 

of its energy consumption, there is a monitoring system in place and a group of trained 

individuals in its maintenance team at the Production Plant. 

The following graphs (based on computed electricity bill for the entire Production Plant) 

show the total energy consumption and the total output from FY2017 to FY2019.

The graph below shows the energy consumption per output level (inclusive of energy 

consumed) at the Production Plant: 

 

 

Notwithstanding the fact that cylinders output in FY2019 was 360 cylinders lower than 

in FY2018, however, energy used per output was lower due to the scrapping of 5 

machines. The 5 machines were previously on standby mode to minimise repair and 

maintenance costs while new machines are being phased in. 

The Group’s target is to reduce this consumption per output ratio by around 1% for 

FY2020.  The Group intends to achieve this target by adopting the following measures: 

1. Replacing older machines. 

2. Posting reminders on the walls of the production area to remind employees to 

switch off lightings or any electrical appliances which are not in use; 

3. Setting air-conditioning at a minimum of 25 degrees Celsius;

Overall energy consumption is analysed monthly by the Accounts Manager. Energy 

usage not within the trends are identified within different operational areas and 

investigated for possible faults in the usage methods or the instruments and machinery 

used. With these practices established, the Group aims to improve efficiency in energy 

usage.

The energy used per output in FY2019 was higher as compared with the target mainly 

due to the standby mode of 5 machines coupled with lower output. 

Due to the Covid-19 situation and the economic fallout, there will be some adverse 

impact on cylinders output for FY2020. Due to the lower output, energy used is not 

proportionally reduced due to the need to heat up and start operations as usual to save 

working hours, hence the Group’s target to reduce energy per output ratio by around 

1% for FY2020. 

 

Health and Safety of Employees (GRI 403-2) 

The Group has set an objective which is to raise health and safety standards in the 

workplace so as to achieve zero or minimal cases of reportable serious work-related 

injuries. The Group is committed to provide a safe working environment for its 

employees to safeguard the health and safety of all employees, which it believes will 

greatly enhance morale and satisfaction leading to higher productivity. As such, this 

topic is deemed to be material to the Group. The Group is pleased to report that there 

has not been any reportable serious work-related injuries in the past 5 years. 

All production employees are constantly reminded to be careful during work and to 

wear the appropriate safety equipment. Trainings and briefings are constantly provided 

at the Production Plant and communicated to new and existing employees to 

understand the rules and safety regulations before the start of each work day. 

Reminder messages are also pasted around the production area to reinforce these 

values accordingly. 

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) officer at the Production 

Plant carries out monthly inspection on workplace safety. The OSHA officer will 

perform spot-checks to ensure employees are wearing the correct safety equipment 

and conforming to the safety rules and regulations. There are fire safety inspections 

every quarter at the Production Plant and the Fire and Rescue Department of Malaysia 

performs annual checks to ensure that the necessary requirements are met. 

The Group strictly complies with the following regulations established by the following 

agencies: 

1. Department of Occupational Safety and Health (“DOSH”) - the objective of this 

agency is to prevent industrial accidents and occupational diseases. It also 

ensures safety, health and welfare of people at work as well as protecting other 

people from the safety and health hazards arising from production activities; 

and

2. Department of Environment (“DOE”) - the objective of this agency is to achieve 

abatement of pollution in the country through the enforcement of the 

Environmental Quality Act of 1974 and its subsidiary legislation. It monitors air 

and water quality and noise, manages toxic and hazardous wastes based on 

the “cradle-to-grave” principle.

Training and Education for Employees (GRI 404-1) 

Training and education is an important topic for the Group as it enhances productivity 

of all employees by equipping them with the necessary skillsets to perform their duties 

in an ever-changing working environment. Training and education helps employees to 

learn specific knowledge or skills to improve performance in their current roles that 

brings a greater impact to the Group, which is of utmost importance. 

The training process is as follows: 

 

Management will also choose some safety courses which are open to all employees. 

The Group has been consistently providing all employees with both internal and 

external training for them to perform their job duties efficiently whenever necessary. 

The total training hours provided to employees in the Group can be found in the

The Group recorded 404 training hours in FY2019, which was lower than the 764 

training hours in FY2018, primarily due to the 360 hours attributed to the mandatory 

biennial fire safety training for employees and 80 hours attributed to training on 

handling waste and effluents attended by the OSHA officer (female, executive category) 

in FY2018.  

Excluding the 440 hours attributable to the specified training courses above, there is 

an increase in training of 404 hours in FY2019 as compared with 324 hours in FY2018 

which were for general courses. 

The Group believes that its investment in training for employees will ultimately enhance 

productivity and enable it to identify and exploit new opportunities in the printing 

cylinder business and beyond.  

Training application forms are provided to employees in order for them to select the 

training they require. Some examples of training courses offered to employees are as 

follows: 

a) Financial reporting 

b) ISO 9001:2015 

c) System administration 

d) Occupational safety and health training 

After attending training courses, the employee is then advised to conduct a class to 

share the knowledge and findings with other employees. Induction training is provided 

for new employees to understand topics such as the Group’s processes and work flow, 

their individual job scope and safety procedures. 

Engineers were also hired from countries such as Thailand, Singapore and USA to 

provide training and share experiences and research and development knowledge on 

the equipment with other employees. 

The average hours of training per employee of 4.7 hours for FY2019 exceeded the 

target of 3.4 hours.
