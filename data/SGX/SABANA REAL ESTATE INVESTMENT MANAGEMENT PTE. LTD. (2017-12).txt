SABANA REIT  |  Sustainability Report 2017

As the Board of Directors (“Board”) of the Manager of 

Sabana REIT, we are pleased to present Sabana REIT’s 

inaugural sustainability report.

This report charts the Trust’s material environmental, 

social and governance (“ESG”) topics, and the Manager’s 

approach in managing these topics, and their performance 

indicators.

Engagement with ESG issues has gained greater 

momentum globally, regionally and locally, and stakeholders 

such as investors and business partners are increasingly 

paying attention to them. In Singapore, a carbon tax of 

S$5 per tonne of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions has 

been passed in Parliament and will be imposed from 2019 

onwards. 

We recognise that ESG topics are increasingly important 

to Sabana REIT unitholders (“Unitholders”) and other 

key stakeholders. Therefore, we affirm our commitment 

Board Statement

to manage our ESG risks and opportunities across all 

our property segments. In managing both business 

opportunities and ESG risks prudently, we will be  

able to continue delivering long-term value to all our 

stakeholders.

The Board has oversight of the Manager’s ESG strategies 

and policies and is supported by the management team in 

overseeing the management, implementation and reporting 

of these strategies and policies. The Board has reviewed 

the process by which the Trust’s material ESG topics were 

determined and agrees that the ESG topics thus determined 

and presented in this report are an adequate representation 

of the material ESG topics.

As the Manager of Sabana REIT, we believe that the 

journey towards sustainability will future-proof us against 

ESG risks, so that we can continue creating value for all 

our stakeholders. We look forward to the route ahead with 

confidence and optimism.

The Manager was incorporated in Singapore on 15 March 

2010 and is wholly-owned by Sabana Investment Partners 

Pte. Ltd. (“SIP”), of which the shareholders are Vibrant 

Group Limited (the “Sponsor”), Blackwood Investment Pte. 

Ltd. (“Blackwood”) and Atrium Asia Capital Partners Pte. 

Ltd. (“AACP”). The primary activities of the Trust are to 

invest in income-producing real estate used for industrial 

purposes, as well as real estate-related areas, in line with 

Shari’ah investment principles. The below illustration shows 

the trust structure of Sabana REIT.

As a Shari’ah compliant REIT, Sabana REIT is required to 

ensure that the total rental income from tenants engaging 

in activities which are non-permissible under the Shari’ah 

Guidelines, does not exceed 5.0% per annum of the 

gross revenue of Sabana REIT’s portfolio of properties.  

Non-Shari’ah compliant activities include conventional 

financial and insurance services, gaming, non-halal food 

production, 

tobacco-related 

products, 

non-permitted 

entertainment activities and stock-broking in non-compliant 

securities. In FY2017, the rental income from non-

permissible activities accounts for approximately 0.31% of 

Sabana REIT’s total gross revenue.

SABANA REIT  |  Sustainability Report 2017

UNITHOLDERS’ 

INTERESTS FIRST

We strive to build a 

portfolio of quality 

assets for our 

Unitholders.

FOCUS ON VALUE 

CREATION 

We promise to 

create value for 

Unitholders  

by creating success 

factors and direction 

for the future.

INTEGRITY

We are committed 

to the values of 

responsibility, 

transparency and 

professionalism.

FAIRNESS AND 

EQUALITY

We ensure that our 

business activities 

are consistent 

with the principles 

of fairness, 

partnerships and 

equality.

PEOPLE

We recognise that 

our people are our 

greatest assets. 

By creating and 

maintaining a 

conducive working 

environment, our 

people will grow 

professionally and 

make a positive 

impact to both the 

organisation and 

society. 

Our Core Values

We are guided by our core values. They define our culture and shape our personality and decision-making process.

 

At the heart of our business is the interest of our Unitholders. 

Our main business objective is to provide them with 

regular and stable returns in a transparent, sustainable 

and accountable manner. We also aim to achieve long-

term growth in distribution per unit (“DPU”) and net asset 

value (“NAV”) per unit in Sabana REIT, while maintaining 

an appropriate capital structure for the Trust. The portfolio 

is reviewed regularly and where appropriate, divest 

underperforming assets to recycle capital.

The foundation of our sustainability strategy is built upon our 

commitment to our key stakeholders. As we work to integrate 

sustainability in all our operations, we are committed in 

engaging our stakeholders to leave a positive impact. 

All suppliers, vendors and contractors are required to 

comply with all applicable laws and regulations. The 

Manager reviews them during the selection phase and 

regularly assesses their performance.

Strategic Review

In February 2017, in response to feedback from Unitholders, 

the Sponsor and Manager of Sabana REIT jointly carried 

out a Strategic Review, considering all options to further 

the sustainable growth of Sabana REIT and the interest of 

Unitholders. A Strategic Review Committee (“SRC”) formed 

by the Manager held discussions with various parties. 

Based on the review of the indicative and non-binding 

proposals received, the Manager entered into discussions 

with the Manager of ESR-REIT.

In November 2017, the Manager made an announcement 

that with the cessation of discussions, it is working on the 

following to improve Sabana REIT’s performance:

• 

Rejuvenate the Trust’s portfolio through selective 

divestments and active asset management

• 

Renewal of senior leadership

• 

Enhancing the Board of Directors

The Manager delivered on the recalibrated strategy 

promptly, appointing Mr Donald Han as its new CEO in 

January 2018, refreshing the Board with the addition of Mr 

Tan Cheong Hin and Mr Kelvin Tan in January 2018 and 

November 2017 respectively, and advancing talks for the 

strategic divestment3 of 6 Woodlands Loop while exploring 

other options to improve occupancy and revenue. The 

key appointments in January 2018 marked the end of the 

Strategic Review.

The divestment exercise was subsequently completed on 29 March 2018.

SABANA REIT  |  Sustainability Report 2017

Identification

A list of potentially material ESG topics were identified by reviewing our 

peers and the Global Reporting Initiative’s (“GRI”) Standards framework, 

including the G4 Construction and Real Estate Sector Supplement.

Validation

The list of material topics was approved and signed-off by the Board  

of Directors.

Materiality 

Our formal materiality assessment process began in 2016 

where we started internal conversations on key topics 

that are material to our business. We began engaging our 

internal stakeholders, asking for opinions on and insights 

into potentially material topics.

With the guidance of an independent sustainability consulting 

firm, we adopted the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles’ 

recommended guidelines for Materiality Assessment and 

GRI’s Principles for Defining Report Content. We took 

a four-step approach in determining our material topics, 

which involves identification, prioritisation, validation, and 

review. We have concluded the implementation of the first 

three of the four steps. To complete this process, we will 

conduct a review of our material topics by engaging external 

stakeholders on materiality for our next sustainability report.

Prioritisation

The ESG topics were prioritised through a materiality assessment 

workshop, which was attended by the Senior Management team and key 

staff from across Sabana REIT operations. The topics were prioritised 

according to their importance to internal stakeholders and the assumed 

importance to external stakeholders. External stakeholders’ perspective 

was based on feedback that Sabana REIT has received through our 

regular engagement with them.

The list of our material topics can be found in the following

tier and are ‘critical’ and four material topics that fall under 

Second tier and are of ‘high’ importance to our business. 

These ten material topics form the core of this sustainability 

report.

We will continue to keep abreast of changes in our 

business environment to ensure that our material ESG 

topics remain relevant for Sabana REIT’s business and will 

review these topics continued materiality at an appropriate 

time. The process of developing a range of measurable,  

time-bound sustainability targets for our material ESG topics 

is underway, and we will report on our progress in our next 

sustainability report. We also aim to engage stakeholders 

in the near future to obtain their feedback on our material 

topics and Sabana REIT’s overall sustainability.

Engaging with Our Stakeholders 

Effective communication is an integral part of our business 

strategy. We proactively engage with our key stakeholders 

to build solid, lasting and trusted relationships. As part of 

our efforts to maintain open communication channels, we 

regularly hold constructive dialogues with key stakeholders, 

including Unitholders, buy and sell-side analysts, fund 

managers, potential investors and the media. Through this, 

we believe we will be able to provide the appropriate level 

of transparency on our operations.

As the Trust’s Manager, we believe it is imperative that we 

provide timely, clear and consistent information to our key 

stakeholders so that our stakeholders, and specifically our 

Unitholders, can more accurately make informed decisions.

During the materiality assessment process, we took the 

opportunity to refresh our stakeholder list and renew 

our focus on engaging with these key stakeholders.  

We 

intend 

to 

continue 

to 

deepen 

our 

current  

engagements and are looking forward to receiving their 

feedback on our sustainability topics and milestones. 

A summary of our interactions with our stakeholders is 

outlined below:

• 

Business Partners (including suppliers/service 

providers): 

We conduct meetings and ad hoc site visits with vendors, 

where necessary. The main objective of our engagement 

with this group of stakeholders is to improve planning 

and communication.

• 

Employees:

Among the important issues brought up by employees 

are competitive remuneration and benefits, health, 

workplace safety, work-life balance, empowerment 

and proactive engagement. We uphold principles of 

workplace equality and diversity, and aim to provide job 

security and opportunities for career progression. The 

main forums for employee engagements are annual 

performance reviews, training programmes, regular 

team members’ meetings and team bonding activities.

SABANA REIT  |  Sustainability Report 2017

Commitment to 

Sustainability

• 

Government and Regulatory bodies:

Sabana REIT’s compliance with all relevant laws and 

regulations is paramount. Through regular meetings and 

site inspections, especially in the context of renewals of 

government approvals, we ensure the Trust’s continued 

compliance with applicable laws and regulatory 

requirements.

• 

Investment Community (including Unitholders, 

Fund Managers, Buy and Sell-side Analysts, as well 

as Media): 

Important issues include discussions on Sabana REIT’s 

strategic outlook and growth prospects. We also provide 

regular updates on our portfolio’s performance, asset 

and capital management, public announcements via 

SGXNet, acquisitions and divestments, as well as any 

major corporate developments. The main channels 

of communication with the investment community 

are through Annual General Meetings (“AGM”), our 

committed investor relations team, results briefings 

with analysts, face-to-face meetings and investor 

conferences. The dedicated investor relations segment 

on our website provides regular updates on Sabana 

REIT’s financial and non-financial information.

• 

Community:

Since its inception, Sabana REIT has been actively 

engaging with the community, participating in Corporate 

Social Responsibility (CSR) activities and made 

numerous donations to charitable organisations. In 

previous years, the Manager organised several blood-

donation drives at 151 Lorong Chuan which saw good 

participation from our employees and tenants. In 

FY2017, Sabana REIT contributed S$21,250 from its 

non-Shari’ah income to Smile Asia, a global alliance 

of independent charities collaborating to treat facial 

deformities. We will continue to engage the community 

in a meaningful manner.

• 

Tenants:

From time to time, Sabana REIT sponsors events 

for tenants, organises lunches and sends festive 

hampers to tenants on special occasions. We aim to 

improve communication, foster better relationships 

and understand our tenants’ needs and requirements  

through an annual tenant satisfaction survey. We also 

engage with prospective tenants to understand their 

needs and requirements.

• 

Unitholders:

We value Unitholders’ feedback and work towards 

ensuring their concerns and opinions are taken into 

account in our business decisions.

On 28 April 2017, the Manager held an Extraordinary 

General Meeting (“EGM”) following a requisition letter from 

66 Unitholders of Sabana REIT. While one of the resolutions 

was a proposal to remove the Manager, the Manager 

nonetheless proceeded to organise the EGM as duty-

bound by the provisions of the Trust Deed. The majority of 

Unitholders at the EGM voted against the proposal and the 

Manager remains committed to engaging all Unitholders 

in a compliant and transparent manner. The Manager 

continues to engage and work closely with our Unitholders 

in accordance with the relevant principles of the Code of 

Corporate Governance 2012 (“2012 Code”). 

Membership in Associations

In addition to engaging our stakeholders, Sabana REIT 

also participates as a member in various organisations. The 

Manager is a member of the Investor Relations Professionals 

Association (Singapore), Singapore Business Federation 

and Singapore International Chamber of Commerce.

SABANA REIT  |  Sustainability Report 2017

Governance

The Manager is committed to upholding high standards of 

corporate governance which are essential to sustaining the 

Trust’s business and performance. The Manager believes 

that high standards of corporate governance serve as a 

solid foundation in delivering value to our stakeholders. 

Sabana REIT’s Corporate Governance Report describes 

the Manager’s corporate governance framework and 

practices in compliance with the principles and guidelines 

of the 2012 Code. The Manager confirms that it adheres 

to the principles and guidelines set out in the 2012 Code 

and any deviations from the 2012 Code are explained.  

This report can be found on pages 63 to 82 of our 2017 

Annual Report.

We have applied the precautionary principle and have made 

efforts to formalise sustainable governance structures to 

ensure its effective management within Sabana REIT.

 

Board Matters 

Our Board currently consists of four Directors, three of 

whom are Independent and Non-Executive. As Independent 

Directors make up more than half of the Board, no individual 

or group is deemed to have a controlling influence over the 

Board’s decision-making process. This is also in compliance 

with the requirements of the Monetary Authority of Singapore 

(“MAS”). For more information on the principles governing 

our Board and the profile of our Directors, please refer to 

our Corporate Governance Report on pages 63-82 of our 

2017 Annual Report. 

Risk Identification &amp; Management 

Since the Board is the body responsible for the governance 

and management of risks, it also considers sustainability 

matters and risks alongside operational, financial and 

compliance risks. The Board ensures that management 

maintains a sound system of risk management and internal 

controls to safeguard Unitholders’ interests and the Trust’s 

assets. The Board also determines the nature and extent 

of significant risks which it is willing to take in achieving its 

strategic objectives. We have an Audit Committee (“AC”) 

in place, responsible for assisting the Board in fulfilling 

responsibilities relating to corporate governance. For more 

details on the composition and role of our AC, please refer 

to pages 73-75 of our 2017 Annual Report.

Regulatory Compliance

Sabana REIT does not tolerate any wilful breaches of 

applicable regulatory laws and regulations. We comply 

with SGX listing rules, the Code on Collective Investment 

Schemes issued by MAS, tax rulings issued by the Inland 

Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) and all other 

applicable legal and regulatory requirements. In furtherance 

of the above, we have internal policies to minimise regulatory 

and compliance risk.

All employees are required to strictly adhere to policies 

outlined in the Employee Handbook. Our enterprise-wide 

risk management (“ERM”) framework defines the process 

for management of risk and how to mitigate or eliminate it.

Sabana REIT complies with all relevant legislation, 

regulation, accounting standards, guidelines and directives 

affecting REITs in Singapore. In addition to these legal 

frameworks, Sabana REIT is managed in accordance with 

Shari’ah investment principles and procedures. In the event 

of Shari’ah principles conflicting with the laws, rules and 

regulations applicable to Sabana REIT, such laws, rules 

and regulations prevail.

In managing Sabana REIT, the Manager must also comply 

with all regulations governing REIT Managers in Singapore. 

However, from March to December 2017, the Manager’s 

Audit Committee did not meet the requirement set in SGX 

listing rule 704(8), i.e. to have a minimum of 3 members and 

to fill any vacancy no later than 3 months. We applied our 

best efforts in headhunting suitable candidates to join the 

AC and wrote to the regulators to explain our challenging 

circumstances. Subsequently, on 25 January 2018, a third 

independent director joined the Audit Committee, thus 

resolving the issue of non-compliance.

Business Ethics &amp; Anti-Corruption

In managing Sabana REIT, the Manager, its wholly-owned 

subsidiary, the Property Manager, Sabana Property 

Management Pte. Ltd., and all employees are required 

to comply with the Manager’s Code of Best Practices on 

Securities Transactions. 

Governance and 

Risk Management 


10

SABANA REIT  |  Sustainability Report 2017

Governance and 

Risk Management 

Fraud and corruption are risks to the continuity of business 

and undermines fair business practices. The Trust has a 

policy of zero tolerance for fraud and corruption. We are 

committed to a high standard of compliance with regard 

to accounting, financial reporting, internal controls, 

corporate governance and auditing requirements as 

well as any legislation that is relevant to our business. 

We ensure that employees conduct their business 

with fairness and integrity in all business relationships.  

A 

culture 

of 

transparency 

and 

accountability 

is 

encouraged by putting in place various mechanisms to 

ensure minimal risk of incidents of fraud, corruption or 

other kinds of regulatory non-compliance.

The Employee Handbook provides clear guidance on 

matters relating to appropriate behaviour. Employees are 

expected to demonstrate the highest level of professional 

conduct when conducting business on behalf of the 

Manager. They must exercise prudence and integrity in 

their relationships with stakeholders. 

In FY2017, no public legal cases regarding corruption were 

brought against the Trust, the Manager and its employees, 

and there were no confirmed incidents of corruption.

Whistle-blowing Policy

The AC has established procedures to provide employees 

of the Manager, as well as tenants and vendors of the Trust 

with well-defined and accessible channels to report on 

suspected fraud, corruption, dishonest practices or other 

similar matters relating to the Trust or the Manager. It also 

provides clear guidelines for the independent investigation 

of any reports and appropriate follow-up action.

The aim of the Manager’s whistle-blowing policy is to 

encourage the reporting of such matters in good faith, with 

the confidence that anyone making such reports will be 

treated fairly, and to the extent possible, be protected from 

reprisal. Where appropriate, an independent third party may 

be appointed to assist in the investigation.

Economic Growth

Our Customers

Economic growth is considered a key material topic at 

Sabana REIT as maintaining a profitable portfolio is how we 

create value for all our stakeholders. Details of The Trust’s 

FY2017 economic and financial performance can be found 

in the Financial Highlights, pages 12 and 13, and Financial 

Statements, pages 91-101 of our 2017 Annual Report.

Our customers (i.e. Sabana REIT’s tenants) are important 

to us. Our aim is to always be accountable to our customers 

and ensure business practices are carried out in a fair 

and transparent manner. This is to build relationships 

based on trust and integrity through consistency and open 

communication. 

Customer Satisfaction 

Tenant satisfaction forms the core of our business. Our 

tenants’ success translates into our success as a REIT. At 

Sabana REIT, we aim to provide the highest level of service 

to our tenants. 

The Manager seeks to maintain a high overall tenant 

satisfaction through regular communication, monthly 

site visits, prompt response to tenants’ feedback, timely 

resolution of issues and progressive upgrading of facilities.


11

SABANA REIT  |  Sustainability Report 2017

Health and safety is a core value at Sabana REIT and is 

an essential part of our business. The health and safety of 

our employees, vendors, tenants and guests is prioritised 

throughout our value chain. We comply with all Singapore 

laws and regulations pertaining to health and safety. 

Compliance with health and safety laws and regulations 

is also included in our tenancy agreements. A Safety 

Committee was formed by the Manager in April 2018 

to address all safety issues. We will provide details and 

initiatives of this Safety Committee in our next sustainability 

report. Before the commencement of projects, contractors 

are required to apply for a Permit-to-Work (“PTW”) which 

includes a risk assessment of their respective work scope, 

schedule of work and other relevant documents. In FY2017, 

there were no incidents of non-compliance concerning 

health and safety impacts and the use of our buildings.

We are pleased to report that there were no work-related 

injuries or fatalities involving our employees, guests and 

visitors in our properties. There was one incident involving 

a contractor in FY2017.

Our Employees’ Health &amp; Well-being 

The health and well-being of our employees is of great 

importance to us. Having healthy, engaged and empowered 

employees will improve our productivity. Amongst others, all 

permanent employees are provided with personal accident, 

hospitalisation and surgical group term life insurance plans. 

In accordance with the Workmen’s Injury Compensation 

Act, we insure all eligible employees with a Workmen’s 

Injury Compensation Insurance Policy. Additional travel 

insurance plans are purchased for all employees who travel 

for business purposes.

Permanent employees are provided with annual health 

screenings through selected panel of doctors. In accordance 

with the provisions of the Employment Act and the Children 

Development CoSavings Act, every female employee who 

has completed three calendar months of service in the 

Company is eligible for sixteen weeks of paid maternity 

leave.

Besides our annual appraisal, we engage our employees 

through regular festive celebrations. These events4 

provide direct informal communication channels for us to 

receive and respond to feedback from our employees.

As an acknowledgment of our employees’ service and 

dedication to the organisation, tokens of appreciation5 

are also given to our employees upon hospitalisation 

or compassionate leave, as well as on the occasion of 

marriage or maternity/paternity leave, etc. 

In FY2017, our employees recorded an overall absentee rate6 

of 3% (2016: 2%), balanced between male and female of 

3% respectively.

These events are organised by the Manager and all expenses are borne by the Manager.

Expenses for tokens of appreciation are borne by the Manager.

Absenteeism refers to workers being absent from work because of incapacity of any kind, not just as the result of work‐related injury or disease, excludes 

permitted leave absences such as holidays, study, maternity or paternity leave, and compassionate leave. Absentee rate is the measure of actual absentee days 

lost, expressed as a percentage of total days scheduled to be worked by all workers for the same period. The increase in the FY2017 absentee rate is due to an 

increase in our employees’ hospitalisation days caused by non‐work‐related matters.

SABANA REIT  |  Sustainability Report 2017

Our Employees

Our employees are our greatest assets. To be a successful 

business that delivers value to our customers and tenants, 

we understand the need to hire employees with a broad 

range of experiences and perspectives to provide us 

with the right skill pool. Furthermore, we empower our 

employees, allowing them to contribute meaningfully to the 

overall success of the Trust and the Manager. As an equal 

opportunity employer, our goal is to have consistent and fair 

policies that recognise and respect cultural differences.

Non-Discrimination, 

Diversity 

and 

Equal 

Opportunity 

The Manager does not discriminate in employment 

opportunities or practices against race, religion, gender, 

nationality, age or the differently-abled. The Manager 

believes in gender equality and equal opportunity for all 

employees. Recruitment and career progression are based 

on meritocratic approach. To provide equal employment and 

advancement opportunities to all individuals, employment 

decisions are based on merits, experiences, abilities and 

professional qualifications.

Employees with concerns about workplace discrimination 

are encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of 

their supervisors. Employees can raise concerns and 

make reports without the fear of reprisal. Engaging in any 

discriminatory behaviour is subject to disciplinary action, 

including termination of employment. 

Performance reviews and planning sessions are designed 

for supervisors and employees to renew their current job 

tasks, set goals, encourage exchange of ideas, recognise 

contributions and develop positive, purposeful approaches 

to achieving work-related goals.

To ensure effective management of our workforce, the 

Manager’s Human Resource (“HR”) department regularly 

tracks and monitors employee data such as employee 

turnover, absentee rate, and training hours. As of 31 

December 2017, the Manager had 40 employees. Our 

entire workforce is based in Singapore, has permanent 

employment contracts and is working full-time. Overall, 

our workforce is fairly balanced, with 42% female and 58% 

male employees. Most of our employees are aged between 

30 and 50 years.

As diversity, inclusion and equal opportunity are important 

for our organisation, female employees make up 50%, 43% 

and 25% of our workforce in the Non-Executives, Executives 

and Senior Management categories, respectively.

Training and Development 

The Manager encourages its employees to pursue their 

interest in continuous education and job specific trainings. 

We are supportive of applications for membership in 

Professional Bodies and support the participation in 

conferences and seminars. The Manager provides 

educational assistance with formal qualifications and 

professional development through short courses. Our 

training budget is allocated such that each employee has 

an allowance of up to 5 days of study leave and up to 3 days 

of examination leave per calendar year.

In FY2017, each employee benefitted from an average 

of 5.7 hours of certified training, with a breakdown of 5.8 

hours for our male employees, and 5.6 hours for our female 

employees. The scope of our training hours currently only 

includes trainings that come with certification. We will 

capture training hours from attending conferences and 

seminars in our sustainability report in the future. As of 31 

December 2017, a total of 31 out of 40 employees benefitted 

from certified training.

SABANA REIT  |  Sustainability Report 2017

We are committed to high standards of environmental 

stewardship. As a real estate owner, we understand that our 

assets’ environmental footprint is closely connected to our 

operational costs. We also understand that the real estate 

sector can have long-lasting impacts on the environment. 

Therefore, we are working to improve the environmental 

sustainability of our existing assets and invest in buildings 

with higher environmental standards, where viable. We will 

be disclosing the targets for our key environmental indicators 

in our FY2018 sustainability report and start tracking our 

performance against these targets from FY2019 onwards.

Sabana REIT is committed to complying with all applicable 

environmental 

requirements 

enforced 

by 

governing 

authorities in Singapore. In FY2017, there were no incidents 

of non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations. 

Energy Efficiency &amp; Climate Change

Singapore has made strong commitments as part of its 

Nationally Determined Contributions (“NDC”) under the 

Paris Agreement to reduce emissions intensity by 36% from 

2005 levels by 2030. The real estate and building sector 

greatly contributes to these GHG emissions. We understand 

that action from the real estate industry is imperative and 

urgent. We have embarked on a journey to make our 

portfolio carbon-efficient and thus contribute to Singapore’s 

transition to a lower carbon economy.

With our increased focus on reducing our operational and 

carbon footprint, we are pleased to report that in FY2017, 

we recorded an improvement in our total building energy 

consumption and intensity.

In FY2017, we installed energy-saving lightbulbs in our 

buildings and successfully lowered our total usage of energy 

by 7.5% from 62,878 MWh in FY2016 to 58,140 MWh. We 

achieved a 10.9% decline in our total building energy 

intensity per GFA from 24.8 kWh/ft2 in FY2016 to 22.1 kWh/

ft2, while we achieved an 8.7% decline in our total building 

energy intensity per GFA occupied from 28.8 kWh/ft2 in 

FY2016 to 26.3 kWh/ft2.

* 

Building energy use and GHG emissions of the High-tech Industrial segment 

exclude tenants’ energy use and GHG emissions in 15 Jalan Kilang Barat as 

it is independently managed by the tenants.

**  Total building energy use, GHG emissions and intensities exclude all 

buildings in the Chemical Warehouse &amp; Logistics segment and tenants’ 

energy use and GHG emissions in 15 Jalan Kilang Barat. These buildings 

are independently managed by our tenants.

Environment

Resulting from the decrease in our buildings’ energy 

consumption and intensity, emissions intensity and total 

building GHG emissions of our assets have decreased 

accordingly.

Water Management

In line with the government’s water conservation efforts, 

the Manager has embarked on water efficiency initiatives 

in our buildings. Two of our buildings at 151 Lorong Chuan 

and 508 Chai Chee Lane are implementing Water Efficiency 

Management Plans (“WEMP”) as stipulated by the Public 

Utilities Board (“PUB”). The Manager also believes in the 

importance of inculcating amongst employees and tenants 

the values of reducing, reusing and recycling water. 

As a result of our water efficiency initiatives, we have 

successfully reduced our total water consumption by 2.1% 

from 199,171m3 in FY2016 to 194,910m3 in FY2017. While 

it is challenging to encourage our tenants and service 

vendors to go on board with the Manager’s water efficiency 

initiatives, we will continue to raise awareness and reduce 

our buildings’ water consumption where possible.

*  

Building water consumption of the High-tech Industrial segment excludes 

tenants’ water consumption in 15 Jalan Kilang Barat, and the building 

water consumption in 23 Serangoon North Avenue 5 as water usage is 

independently managed by our tenants.

^ 

Building water consumption of the Warehouse &amp; Logistics segment excludes 

the building water consumption in 34 Penjuru Lane as water usage is 

independently managed by our tenants.

Sabana REIT strives to be a responsible corporate citizen. 

We are committed to building lasting relationships with 

communities we operate in through various activities. Since 

its inception, the Trust has made numerous donations to 

charitable organisations and organised several blood 

donation drives in our corporate office at 151 Lorong Chuan, 

which have seen good participation from both employees 

and tenants.

An amount of S$21,250 was donated to Smile Asia in 

the first quarter of FY2017, an alliance of charities which 

has been providing medical assistance to children with 

facial deformities. The funds will be utilised to support 

their 

medical 

efforts 

in 

sending 

qualified 

medical  

professionals, who will provide free surgical treatments to 

underprivileged children in Asia born with facial deformities 

like cleft lip and/or cleft palate and do not have access to 

proper treatment.

We are also pleased to report that in FY2017, Sabana REIT 

was not involved in any operations that caused significant 

negative impacts on local communities.
