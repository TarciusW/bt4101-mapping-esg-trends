Sustainability Report 2020 | AMOS Group Limited  |  3 

M E S S A G E  F R O M  O U R  C H A I R M A N

“We recognize that sustainable business practices are key to achieving our 

vision and mission.  We strongly believe in delivering shareholder value 

responsibly and positively contributing to society.”

We are pleased to issue the second Sustainability 

Report (“Report”) for AMOS Group Limited (“AMOS”). 

The Report reflects AMOS’ performance as well as our 

strategy and vision towards a sustainable future.

We recognize that sustainable business practices are 

key to achieving our vision and mission.  We strongly 

believe in delivering shareholder value responsibly and 

positively contributing to society.   We therefore place 

great emphasis on employing a strategic approach to 

manage and oversee Economic, Environmental, Social 

and Governance (“EESG”) factors significant to our 

business.

Early 2020 witnessed a major disruption brought on by 

the COVID-19 pandemic, which has destabilised both 

personal lives and businesses.  The pandemic reminds 

us of the importance of integrating sustainability into 

our business.  We continue to work on reducing our 

negative environmental impact and adopting more 

responsible business practices across our supply chain. 

Our efforts are demonstrated with initiatives such as 

the Carbon Neutral Program through which we aim to 

off-set our unavoidable emissions, and our evolving 

supplier assessments which are expanding to include 

more social considerations.  

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of AMOS 

Group Limited has always been committed to 

sustainability and fully supports the adoption of the 

SGX sustainability reporting guidelines.  The Board 

oversees AMOS’ sustainability performance, practices 

and initiatives and its compliance with SGX guidelines 

on sustainability reporting, reviewing progress 

throughout the year.  The Board was also involved 

in the determination of the material EESG factors for 

AMOS

Through our sustainability journey, we encourage 

our stakeholders and business partners to join us in 

furthering the economic, environmental, and social 

well-being of the communities with which we interact, 

together contributing to a sustainable society.

Kyle Arnold Shaw, Jr.

Executive Chairman

performance of AMOS by addressing key material issues 

identified by stakeholders with planned follow up 

measures.

The Working Committee monitors and collates the data 

and information for the material EESG factors.  Both of 

these committees comprise of representatives from all 

business units. 

Sustainability management will be embedded in our 

values, vision and mission, which we are in the process 

of refreshing for AMOS.

Materiality is a critical element of our sustainability 

strategy because it ensures we provide our stakeholders 

with the sustainability information most relevant to 

them and our business.  

We conducted a materiality assessment last year to 

identify seven material topics.  This financial year, we 

continue to focus on these issues and may consider an 

assessment review for subsequent reports. 

The material factors 

reported in AMOS’ report 

last year were reassessed 

and new factors were 

considered based on a peer 

and industry review.

Through discussions with 

senior management, the 

factors were deliberated in 

relation to the significance 

of their impact and 

importance.

The list of material factors 

was circulated to the Board 

for feedback and to ensure 

completeness and relevance 

of factors selected.

After discussion with the 

Board, we concluded the 

final material factors to be 

reported for AMOS. 

The Sustainability 

Committee will re-examine 

the material factors in 

relation to stakeholder 

feedback and market 

conditions on an on-going 

basis.

1 / Energy and Emissions

Why this is material?

AMOS is a global provider of supplies, services and 

solutions to major international shipping fleets and 

energy operators. Our fulfilment center in Singapore 

operates as our headquarters, warehousing, cold chain 

storage, and provisioning. There are two main sources 

of energy that we consume. Our few chartered vessels 

along with our fleet of vehicles run on diesel, while our 

office premises, warehouse and fulfilment center, which 

are all located in the same area, primarily use electricity. 

Reducing our total energy consumption helps us to not 

only reduce our carbon footprint and impact on the 

environment, but also drives significant cost savings, 

improving our economic performance.

Management Approach

We strive to lower our energy usage by increasing 

awareness among employees, implementing energy 

efficient technologies and leveraging carbon offsets. 

The current practices in place are as follows:

Awareness among employees

• Display energy saving posters and related labelling in 

prominent areas in the AMOS office and warehouse to 

remind employees of energy conservation practices.

• Improve AMOS employees’ awareness of energy 

savings in yearly briefings.

• Encourage employees to reduce energy consumption 

in the office by maintaining an adequate air 

temperature in office.

Energy Efficient Technologies

• Use of motion sensor lights at stairways and toilets.

• Use of energy saving bulbs.

• Efficient planning of route for our fleet.

• Efficiency checks on chillers.

2 / Carbon Neutral Program

We recognize that reducing our footprint is a journey, 

so for emissions that we are not able to reduce at this 

stage, we have begun participation in the Carbon 

Neutral Program. In line with the program, we have 

purchased carbon offsets for our emissions since 2016 

and have been awarded with carbon neutral certificates 

by Environmental Solutions (Asia) Pte Ltd (“ES Power”) 

as listed below:

• Certificate of retirement of 441.1 MT of CO2 equivalent 

of carbon credits against greenhouse gas emission for 

the organization to carbon neutralize the electricity 

consumption of 1,068 MWh from 10 March 2017 to 

27 April 2018.

• Certificate of retirement of 290.8 Tonnes of CO2 

equivalent of carbon credits against greenhouse gas 

emission for the organization to carbon neutralize 

the electricity consumption of 704 MWh from 

10 March 2018 to 9 March 2019.

• Certificate of retirement of 624 Tonnes of CO2 

equivalent of carbon credits against greenhouse gas 

emission for the organization to carbon neutralize 

the electricity consumption of 1485 MWh from 

1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020.

3 / Effluent &amp; Waste Management

Why this is material?

We are conscious that non-hazardous waste is generated 

from our operations. Such waste primarily includes 

metal scrap, plastics, paper and wood amongst others. 

Any mishandling in disposal may result in environmental 

damage through land or air pollution. We also see waste 

reduction as means of reducing operational costs and 

fostering innovation in design.

Management Approach

We undertook a number of waste reduction measures 

in FY 2020:  

• Since April 2019, we have begun engagement with 

Tidy Waste Management, a waste collector that 

ensures proper handling of recyclable waste. They 

provide bins and place them across different sections 

of the warehouse, segregating the waste into paper 

and plastics.  They collect the waste daily, compile it 

monthly and subsequently sell it for recycling.  The 

rental for these bins is offset by the fee collected for 

recycling. 

• Over the past year, AMOS put our Group Global Plastic 

Policy in effect,  with a commitment to consume fewer 

resources and manage these resources responsibly by 

adopting the ‘reduce, reuse, recycle’ principles across 

all our waste streams and procurement decisions. 

• We have also commenced tracking the amount of 

plastic used for wrapping the pallets, which are 

shrink wrapped to protect against adverse weather 

conditions. We purchased equipment that will 

ultimately reduce the plastic consumption per pallet 

by reducing the number of wraps and controlling the 

tension of each wrap. 

• We have also been invited by our Client, Wilhelmsen 

Ship Management, to be a part of the core members of 

a joint committee with DNVGL, aimed at tackling the 

issue of plastics in the marine industry. The committee 

consists of Wilhelmsen appointed personnel, industry 

experts and some suppliers.  During this financial 

year, two round table discussions were held and DNV 

is currently looking at developing a plastic index.

The increase in non-hazardous waste is attributed to the

with AMOS International (S) Pte Ltd. 

We also place strict emphasis on proper disposal of 

recyclable waste and constantly remind everyone so this 

could lead to the significant increase in non-hazardous 

waste collection.

Our People

Employees are our most vital asset. We are committed 

to fair, equitable and quality employment practices in 

our recruitment process to attract, develop and retain a 

talented, innovative, flexible and motivated workforce in 

every country where we operate.  

We embrace diversity and inclusion, aim to attract and 

retain the best people to work with us, develop their 

talents and abilities, and most importantly, watch out for 

their safety and well-being.

1 / Employee Welfare &amp; Talent Retention

Why is it Material?

Attracting and retaining talent has been a challenge in 

the maritime and offshore industry over the past few 

years.  High rates of turnover and the inability to attract 

the right talent disrupts the growth of the business, 

hinders succession planning and lowers the overall 

morale of the organization.  

Management Approach

Since our merger in year 2018, we have been striving to 

standardize processes across the two companies.  This year, 

we have implemented standardized policies pertaining to 

payroll, leave and recruitment processes. These changes 

were put into full effect as of November 2019. 

Following the implementation of these policies, we have 

also conducted communication sessions on our new 

policies for our employees. We are also in the process 

of refreshing our employee code of conduct, KPIs and 

appraisal process; all of which we aim to complete in the 

fourth quarter of 2020. 

We continue to engage with our employees to 

understand and address any challenges.  Given the 

evolving COVID-19 situation, we held a Business 

Continuity Plan (BCP) Townhall to address the emerging 

challenges.  Our CEO delivered a speech to assure 

and explain our upcoming business practices whilst 

highlighting our organization’s way forward.

S O C I A L

We continue to practice fair employment, provide 

employment benefits, reward their performance and 

build a diverse culture in our efforts to manage, nourish 

and retain our talent.

Fair Employment

We reward employees fairly based on their ability, 

performance, contribution and experience. All our 

employees are given employment contracts with 

clear terms and conditions and equal employment 

opportunities that are clearly cited in the employee 

handbook. We abide by labour laws in Singapore and 

adapt the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive 

Employment Practices (“TAFEP”).

Employee Benefits

Ensuring employee welfare and medical benefits are 

an important priority.  We provide insurance for all our 

employees. Furthermore, we’ve provide free lunch to all 

of our staff.  As part of facilitating increased inclusion, 

we hosted a year end lunch buffet and celebrated 

Chinese New Year together.  This includes a distribution 

of hampers to the employees, which were sponsored by 

vendors and customers.

Furthermore, on a departmental level, we have 

introduced a more flexible style of working as part of our 

BCP for the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our industry is foreign labour intensive, and we see their 

welfare as imperative to the success of our operations. 

We provide them with housing allowance with the 

purpose of enabling better flexibility in their choice of 

living. We also provide transport to all our employees 

from the MRT station to the workplace given that most 

of our employees are reliant on public transport and do 

not possess their own vehicle.

Diversity and Equal Opportunities

AMOS is committed to fair, equitable and quality 

employment practices in our recruitment process 

to attract, develop and retain a talented, innovative, 

flexible, and motivated workforce in every country that 

we operate in. All employment decisions will conform 

to the principle of equal opportunity by imposing only 

the valid requirements of the position on the candidate 

under consideration. We encourage diversity of race, 

age, skills, experience and gender, assessing candidates 

and employees on merit alone.

Target

As per our report last year, we have extended existing 

internship programmes to more polytechnic colleges 

and universities to attract new employees. This financial 

year, we’ve employed a total of 4 interns. 

2 / Training &amp; Development  

Why is it Material?

We offer training to assist employees achieve a higher 

level of competency and safety standards, in order to 

further enhance the quality of our services and products. 

Such trainings also aim to build a well-motivated, stable 

workforce with a high level of teamwork. A key objective 

of training is to develop competencies, which would 

enable our employees to perform their current or future 

jobs successfully. All our training programs are geared 

towards the following objectives:

• Strengthening job skills and knowledge of employees.

• Improving operational efficiency and productivity.

• Developing/maximizing the potential of employees, 

to the mutual benefit of AMOS and employees’ career 

development.

Management Approach

In FY 2020, we focused on providing more mandatory 

training required by Maritime regulators and the 

government. We sent our employees for the following 

mandatory courses during the year:

• First Aid Workshop

• Forklift Operator Training Workshop

• ISO Training

• Incident Management training workshop

• Certificate Emergency Response Team (“CERT”) training

Additionally, some employees underwent Occupational 

Safety Training Courses, including: 

• Shipyard Safety Instruction Course for General and Hot 

Work Trade 

• Workplace Health &amp; Safety in Metal Work Training

• Basic Offshore Safety Induction Emergency Training 

(BOSIET) 

• Occupational First Aider Training

3 / Occupational Health and Safety

Why is it material?

We do not compromise on the safety of our employees 

and workers. We recognize our industry is prone to 

health and safety risks therefore it is imperative that we 

ensure our employees’ well-being by having stringent 

safety policies in place. 

Management Approach

Operational health and safety (“H&amp;S”) is managed 

holistically by all departments, where all department 

leads are responsible for the safety of employees 

under their charge. All staff are empowered to stop 

any activities if they are unsafe. Furthermore, there is a 

Quality Health Security Safety Environment (“QHSSE”) 

department 

that 

is 

responsible 

for 

promoting, 

establishing &amp; administering H&amp;S directives and 

governance of the H&amp;S performance throughout the 

organization.  The QHSSE Department along with HR 

also ensures that every new employee goes through an 

induction program where basic H&amp;S responsibilities for 

all employees are discussed. 

AMOS QHSSE Department is working with HR on training 

requirements and ensuring that individuals possess the 

basic competency for their work.  Employees are also 

sent for courses to upgrade their skills and increase 

their knowledge and efficiency in operational safety 

supervision and management. The QHSSE Department 

also routinely engages all other department on their 

Health and Safety performance.  Fire safety drills are 

conducted twice yearly.

The QHSSE department also plays a role in the 

communication of QHSSE alerts from other entities to 

ensure best practices are shared and standard practices 

can be established across the organisation. A designated 

QHSSE personnel will conduct weekly walk-arounds 

with representatives from each department to review 

particular work activities or systems to ensure safe 

operations on the floor. Monthly committee meetings 

are held to discuss safety performance, incidents that 

have occurred, best practices, H&amp;S Campaigns planning 

and to ensure that feedback from workers and other 

employees is addressed.

We have a Risk Management Organization Chart that 

assigns responsibility for conducting risk assessments 

and ensuring that all control measures are adequately 

addressed on the ground.  For every operational activity, 

a BizSafe Level 2 trained personnel approved by the 

Risk Management Organization Chart Team Leader is 

given the responsibility to conduct risk assessment of 

that activity.  The outcome of the risk assessments is 

communicated to the ground workforce. Generally, risk 

is assessed by a 5x5 matrix and control measures are 

determined by the hierarchy of controls.

This year, we faced health and safety risks arising from 

the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to this, the AMOS QHSSE 

Department constantly stays abreast of local regulations 

and worldwide advisories.  We have issued memos and 

directives to all entities on the current situation of the 

pandemic, its impact on the business and subsequent 

measures that should be upheld as an organisation. 

These include travel restrictions, Business Continuity 

Plan, sanitation, temperature checking, etc. 

To ensure business continuity, we have also issued orders 

for all departments to have separate teams working 

away from each other (i.e. Split Teams or Shift Work), to 

ensure that AMOS remains operationally able to support 

the business demands.  

Our employees working in the office during this period 

are mandated to wear a face mask and have their 

temperature checked before entering the premises. Our 

employees are also compliant with the government’s 

initiative of  signing up to and utilizing the “Trace 

Together” to ensure traceability as we combat the 

pandemic. 

AMOS QHSSE Department also works very closely 

with the Procurement department to ensure we are 

complying to the Inventory of Hazardous Materials 

regulations by IMO.  This regulation ensures that all 

specified potentially hazardous material supplied to the 

vessel are within the acceptable threshold limit.  

AMOS has set up a process and system to govern 

purchases of these products which include: establishing 

a controlled guideline for all suppliers supplying these 

materials, declaration of suppliers’ commitment to 

comply with the guidelines, suppliers’ process and 

physical site audits by the QHSSE Department, and site 

audit of suppliers’ manufacturer for a specific product 

by QHSSE Department..  AMOS has also been certified 

by the Workspace Safety and Health Council to have 

fulfilled the requirements to attain bizSAFE Level Star 

and obtained the OHSAS 18001:2007 certification.

G O V E R N A N C E

1 / Responsible Supply Chain Management

Why is it material?

Our supply chain includes a several parties. Our marine 

supplies range from technical supplies such as steel 

valves and personal protective equipment (“PPE”) 

to general supplies such as frozen food and water. 

Our rigging, mooring and lifting business segment 

procures rigging equipment, rigging systems along with 

consumables amongst other items. A large number of 

our suppliers are based overseas. 

We recognize that the suppliers we engage with have 

a significant impact on our sustainability performance.  

Additionally, ensuring that our suppliers provide high 

standards of product quality, health and safety will 

directly improve what we offer to our customers.

Management Approach

AMOS has a close relationship with its strategic partners 

and suppliers who are committed to high quality 

and safety standards. We engage with reputable 

manufacturers and strive for lean procurement to 

support fast turn-around and minimization of wastage.

We have a Procurement and Supplier Management 

Policy, AMOS-CP-PUR-001, which utilizes the Supplier 

Questionnaire Form QA- FM-011 to promote and maintain 

sustainable procurement activities and governance. Our 

Supplier Questionnaire Form QA- FM-011 is employed to 

evaluate our suppliers’ risk assessment on Quality, Health 

and Safety, Environmental and Social responsibility. Any 

gaps identified for potential improvement is followed up 

with a Supplier Improvement Action Plan arranged by 

the QHSSE department. 

In FY2020, we expanded our supplier questionnaire 

to include social issues to enforce suppliers’ social 

responsibility. The social issues include child labour, 

minimum age of employment, compliance programmes 

for corruption bribery &amp; anti-trust, legal proceedings 

and local requirements on working hours as part of our 

supplier assessment process. 

Prior to engaging with a new supplier, we perform a 

pre-qualification assessment as part of our Know Your 

Supplier (“KYS”) policy. This is through a checklist filled 

by the vendor applicants. After assessment, selected 

vendors are included in the Approved Vendor List 

(“AVL”). In addition to quality considerations, compliance 

with environmental regulations and health and safety 

practices are key requirements.

For high risk suppliers, we also conduct periodic audits 

and checks, particularly as many of our customers 

demand supply chain visibility on use of hazardous 

materials such as asbestos. We have established the 

database where the relevant material certifications and 

test reports are readily available to customers to support 

the Inventory of Hazardous Material (IHM).

Performance

We screened 60 suppliers in FY 2020 on environmental 

and social criteria. 

In FY 2020, AMOS commenced auditing a gasket 

manufacturer in India, which is subcontractor of the 

main gasket supplier we employ. Through our risk 

identification processes, we singled this out as a high-

risk area from an environmental and safety perspective. 

The audit results find the supplier to be compliant with 

our environmental and social standards. 

Target

We have implemented social considerations in our 

assessment for new vendors and will be working on 

the supplier code of conduct in the second half of 2020, 

along with the surveillance audit for selected critical 

vendors with the QHSSE team.

We are also currently reviewing our supplier base and 

refining them to ensure that our supply chain is not 

impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

 




20  |  AMOS Group Limited | Sustainability Report 2020

2 / Product Quality and Reliability

Why is it material?

As the marine industry becomes more competitive, 

our customers rely on our brands for safe and quality 

products and services. We believe we can differentiate 

ourselves by providing our customers with products and 

services that exceed their expectations, leading to loyal 

and committed customer relationships that will last in 

the long run.

Management Approach

We use international standards to ensure the quality 

and safety of our products and services.  We reflect 

on the periodic assessment of the health and safety 

impacts of our products and services to identify, assess 

and treat all quality and safety-related risks associated 

with our business activities, products and services in a 

responsible manner.

For ALCONA Brand, one of key offering product range will 

be the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Durability 

and Safety are crucial requirements for customers 

purchasing these products. We ensure the requirements 

are met with the following:

• Products with Product Data Sheet to govern the 

standards and certifications to adhere to during 

tender offers and supply to customers.

The type of standards and certification requirements 

are supported with testing and accreditation from 

the respective appointed testing bodies, along with 

certificate of conformity from AMOS.

Performance

There were no incidents of non-compliance with 

regulations and/or voluntary codes concerning the 

health and safety impacts of products and services 

within the reporting period.  We have not identified 

any non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary 

codes with respect to health and safety impacts of our 

products and services.

Target

We aim to maintain stringent risk assessments of 

our products and services. We strive to achieve zero 

reportable incidents of non-compliance concerning the 

health and safety impacts of products and services in 

the upcoming year.

3 / Ethics &amp; Anti-corruption

Why is it material?

Good corporate governance is an integral element of a 

reliable corporation and enables a company to be more 

transparent and forward-looking. Sound corporate 

governance is also an effective safeguard against fraud 

and anti-corruption, which are foreseeable risks in 

our industry. Any failure to comply can lead to severe 

financial and reputational damage to the company.

Management Approach

At AMOS, we are committed to maintaining a high 

standard of corporate governance. We expect honesty, 

integrity and accountability at every level of the 

company. AMOS has established internal controls to 

ensure the highest standards of governance &amp; fraud 

prevention. The Board and the Management believe 

that an effective whistle-blowing arrangement will 

act as a deterrent to malpractice and wrongdoing, 

encourage openness, promote transparency, underpin 

the risk management systems of AMOS and enhance its 

business practice; thereby increasing the reputation of 

AMOS and its management. We conduct yearly internal 

audit to ensure compliance. Cases of non-compliance are 

directly reported to our Audit committee. Employees, 

suppliers, customers and other stakeholders can directly 

write in to our Audit Committee to report cases of 

fraud or other irregularities. These reported cases are 

thoroughly investigated followed by the undertaking of 

subsequent necessary actions.   

The specific objectives of the policy are:

• Maintain a high standard of corporate governance.

• Provide a channel of communication for AMOS 

employees to report fraudulent practices

• Guide employees on actions to address their concerns 

on suspicious fraudulent activities.

• Provide a process for investigations and management 

reporting.

The whistle-blowing policy can be found on our website 

with details on the scope of the policy, the whistle 

blowing officer, what is not covered in the policy, 

administration and whistle-blowing procedures.

Performance

There have been no cases of corruption at AMOS within 

the reporting year.

Target

We aim to maintain zero reportable incidents relating to 

corruption and bribery.
