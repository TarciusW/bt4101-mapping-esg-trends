MESSAGE FROM OUR CHAIRMAN 

AND GROUP CEO

2017 was a milestone year for Excelpoint, as we celebrated our 30th 

anniversary with a record revenue crossing US$1 billion. This marks 

our presence as one of Asia Pacific’s leading electronic components 

distributor and technology solutions provider.

I am happy to present you with our Sustainability Report 2017, 

which will touch on material factors contributing to our business 

sustainability. 

With the significant growth in the electronics and semiconductor 

industry, we see rising opportunities in 2018 and beyond, with a 

distinct spotlight on the next wave of technology, Internet of Things 

(“IoT”). Excelpoint has always focused on investing in our in-depth 

research and development teams and technical capabilities that 

combine cutting-edge technologies from our suppliers into advanced 

and useful applications for our customers. We believe IoT will become 

a ubiquitous presence everywhere, making life easier, smarter and 

more efficient and sustainable for everyone.

Excelpoint believes in nurturing our human capital. Our employees 

are the cornerstone of our success. When employees are happy and 

engaged, they work harder, smarter, and better. We engage our staff 

and boost their morale and job satisfaction through practising clear 

and open communication and positive reinforcements, and providing 

upskilling programmes, career growth opportunities, employee 

benefits, tier-based working hours, and recreational activities. It is 

a culture we continuously build, and we believe it will impact our 

business positively and sustainably.

Another pillar of our sustainability strategy is to empower the future 

of our nation by giving back to our society. We have extended our 

financial support to the following tertiary institutions and their 

programmes: (1) Singapore Management University through our 

Excelpoint Bursary, (2) National University of Singapore’s Innovation &amp; 

Design Centric Programme, and (3) Hong Kong University of Science and 

Technology’s iSTEAM Robotics Programme 2017, and also participated 

in Halogen Foundation’s Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship 

programme. We believe that the spirit of innovation, entrepreneurship 

and leadership should be inculcated from young.

 

We are also constantly looking at ways in which we can transform 

our business sustainably at the corporate level while caring for the 

environment and the people around us, in order to achieve optimal 

environment, social and governance (“ESG”) performance. We believe 

all these three aspects are interdependent. Hence, we established a 

Sustainability Management Council and embarked on sustainability 

analyses to fine-tune our policies and processes, drive innovation, 

understand and mitigate potential business risks and challenges, 

identify and implement best practices and opportunities, and 

enhance resource and waste management. By incorporating such 

sustainable strategies into our business model, this will boost our 

growth, efficiency, value creation and corporate reputation, and build 

trust and confidence among all our stakeholders.

SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY

Our sustainability strategy is to create long-term value for our stakeholders and shareholders by managing the 

economic, environmental and social impacts, risks, and opportunities.

MATERIAL ESG FACTORS

Our core approach to sustainability and business strategies is to identify, prioritise and manage the  material aspects 

of our business that impact the environment, society and economy most. 

Our senior management team attended a materiality assessment workshop facilitated by an external sustainability 

consultant to identify the most material economic, environmental and social impacts of our business operations. 

While assessing our sustainability impacts, risks and opportunities, we considered the expectations and concerns of 

our critical stakeholders. We also examined sustainability trends in the electronics sector and reporting practices of 

peer companies. Through this exercise, we identified and prioritised most significant material topics to be included 

in this report.

Our material topics have been reviewed and approved by our Sustainability Management Council and our Board 

(please refer to Page 11 for the Sustainability Management Council chart).

We strive to set and achieve highest quality standards to serve our principals and customers. Building and supporting 

a quality culture is at the core of our quality policy. We have established a formal quality system in compliance with 

ISO 9001 standards. The quality management system allows us to maintain and make continuous improvements in 

our processes.

In addition, we invest in ongoing training and education of our employees to ensure high quality of our products 

and services.

MARKETPLACE

Investing in Research and 

Development (“R&amp;D”)

We 

differentiate 

ourselves 

by 

providing 

our 

principals 

and 

customers with a wide range of 

innovative technological services to 

shorten the entry-to-market time at a 

more competitive cost. We leverage on 

new technologies from our principals, 

and also integrate the strengths of 

different principals to create new and 

innovative applications and solutions.

We continuously invest in building 

up our R&amp;D capabilities to drive 

innovation 

and 

to 

create 

cost-

effective solutions for our customers. 

We have established R&amp;D centres in 

Singapore and China, which are supported by our dedicated team of professional engineers. One of our key R&amp;D 

goals is to add value to our suppliers and customers through creating reference designs. 

Equipped with extensive experience in the connectivity segment, our R&amp;D team focuses on innovating new 

technologies that solve our customers’ problems. By keeping abreast with market trends, our R&amp;D experts are able 

to develop required technology solutions, working closely with our suppliers. Over the years, we have excelled in 

communication technologies such as Bluetooth, BLE, Wi-Fi, near field communication, wireless charging and wireless 

audio, which prepares us for the next wave of technology – the world of Internet of Things (“IoT”).

Embracing this exciting wave of technology, we built an IoT demonstration facility to feature our in-depth R&amp;D and 

technical capabilities that combine cutting-edge technologies from our strategic suppliers into advanced and useful 

applications. This facility is a platform for us to showcase our competitive strengths in sensors, wireless connectivity 

and gateway modules, which can be implemented in applications for smart buildings, agriculture and infrastructure. 

We are still improving on the total experience to allow our partners to experience the functionality, efficiency and 

user-friendliness of the applications in simulated settings. With this experience, it will reinforce customers’ confidence 

in us as their partner of choice in this new arena of technology.

We are committed to providing our customers with swift service and exceeding their expectations. In line with our 

quality management system, we have implemented standard operating procedures to address our customers’ needs 

promptly and professionally. We maintain close relationships with our customers to provide them with intensive 

frontline technical support. 

Ensuring Customer Satisfaction 

To understand the expectations of our customers, we conduct quarterly surveys to obtain feedback from them. After 

which, we organise internal meetings to analyse the data, identify the areas we do well, and strategise how best we 

can rectify any processes to enhance our customer relations and experiences. 

Safeguarding Personal Data

We respect the privacy of our employees, suppliers, and customers, and take necessary steps to protect their 

personal data. We have implemented a Personal Data Protection Policy with a stringent process in place to ensure 

that data is accessed only by authorised personnel. 

We comply with applicable laws relating to personal data protection in countries where we operate. In Singapore, we

advancements in our sector.

62.7% of our workforce, while the remaining are fixed-term contract and temporary staff. 61.7% of our employees 

are based in Hong Kong and China, followed by Singapore at 22.8%. About 97.0% of our employees are locals. 

On average, we have a relatively young workforce with male and female employees aged 37.5 years and 36 years

We support internationally accepted norms for protecting human rights. Our policies ban child labour, forced or 

compulsory labour, and discrimination. We respect our employees’ right to freedom of association and collective 

bargaining. 

There were no reported incidents of child labour, forced or compulsory labour and discrimination in the reporting 

year. 

Providing Training 

We operate in a sector that is known for 

rapid 

technological 

advancements 

and 

continuous emergence of new technologies. 

Regular upgrading of skills is a crucial area 

for our business success. Therefore, we 

invest in ongoing training and education of 

our employees. In addition to formal training 

programmes, our employees receive in-house 

or on-the-job trainings.

Providing Employee Benefits 

Our full-time employees receive competitive benefits in line with market practices. These include paid annual leave, 

insurance coverage, an employee share option scheme for our long-serving staff, medical, dental and specialist 

outpatient benefits, staggered work schedules for our support team, and recreational facilities. 

Engaging Employees 

Excelpoint believes that happy, engaged employees work harder, smarter, and better, which will maximise business 

productivity and efficiency. 

To engage our staff and boost their morale and 

job satisfaction, we practise clear and open 

communication and positive reinforcements, 

and provide upskilling programmes, career 

growth 

opportunities, 

tier-based 

working 

hours, and recreational activities such as 

festival celebrations (e.g. Chinese New Year and 

Christmas), bowling, futsal, movie screenings, 

and local and overseas bonding trips.



In celebration of our 30th anniversary in 2017, we mapped 

out activities for our local and regional staff. We held dinner 

celebrations for our employees from Singapore, Hong 

Kong, China, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, 

and Australia, while our employees from India, China and 

Indonesia enjoyed domestic bonding trips.

Practising Occupational Health and Safety 

Our employees’ safety and health at the workplace is one 

of our top priorities, and our ultimate goal is to have a 

zero accident workplace. We are committed to managing 

and reducing safety and health risks through effective risk 

management.

In Singapore, we have obtained BizSafe Level 3 certification 

awarded by the Workplace Safety and Health Council, based 

on an audit conducted by an approved third-party assessor. 

We conduct a risk assessment to identify potential 

workplace safety and health risks to take preventive 

measures. We have implemented safety measures in our 

warehouse operations where tasks involve handling of 

bulky items, and established a safety committee consisting 

of representatives from all departments and our senior 

management. The committee reviews safety standards, 

systems and performances periodically. 

There were no incidents of severe or fatal workplace injuries 

in FY2017.

ENVIRONMENT

We are committed to minimising the environmental impact of our business 

operations through efficient use and conservation of our resources.

As a company engaged mainly in electronics distribution, our direct environmental 

impact consists of the use of electricity in our offices and warehouses, the use 

of fuel in transportation for deliveries, packaging materials, and general waste 

generated from the re-packaging of goods in our warehouses. Even though our 

direct environmental footprint is relatively small, we believe we can contribute to 

global goals of climate change mitigation and resource conservation. 

Our environmental policy is to reduce the impacts of our business activities on the 

environment. Our environmental efforts focus on finding ways to reduce energy 

consumption and waste. We monitor our energy use, resulting carbon emissions 

and the waste generated to review our performance regularly.

We are also supportive of industry-wide initiatives undertaken by electronics manufacturers (many of them are our 

principals or customers) to mitigate the environmental impacts.

Our R&amp;D applications include working with our principals and suppliers to develop technologies that are more 

energy-efficient, such as smart lighting and smart energy.

Energy 

Our approach to energy management involves monitoring and reducing consumption. We have employee awareness 

initiatives to encourage them to turn off lights and air-conditioning in offices when they are not in use.

Our energy data in the report includes purchased electricity, diesel, and fuel. In FY2017, our electricity consumption 

and electricity used per employee were 894,600 kWh and 1,289 kWh respectively. Our offices in Singapore, Hong 

Kong and China accounted for 95.4% of the total electricity used.

Our energy intensity per employee was 5.4 GJ in FY2017, as compared to 5.1 GJ in the previous year.

Carbon Emissions 

Reducing carbon emissions is crucial for achieving reduction targets set by the Paris Agreement to limit rising global 

temperatures to under 2 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels. 

Our carbon emissions originate from electricity consumption within our facilities and the combustion of fuels in our 

vehicles. We measure, monitor, and report our carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using the GHG Protocol guidelines. 

We report our Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon dioxide emissions, and exclude fugitive emissions from refrigerant gases 

that are not material.

In FY2017, our carbon dioxide emissions from the use of electricity, diesel and petrol amounted to 559 tCO2. Our 

emission intensity per employee was 0.81 tCO2, as compared to 0.75 tCO2 in the preceding year.

General Waste

As a trading operation, our waste is limited to mainly packaging materials, which include cartons, plastic, strings, 

plastic wraps, wooden pallets, and paper. Our policy is to minimise and reuse waste where possible. We dispose our 

waste through licensed contractors.

Compliance

We are committed to ensuring compliance with applicable environmental laws. There were no incidents of non-

compliance with environmental rules or regulations in the reporting year.

COMMUNITY

Our community initiatives focus on helping children and youths, and building the next generation of leaders.

Some of our community programmes over the past three years are listed here:

FY2017

• In collaboration with Singapore Management University since 2014, our Excelpoint Bursary has continued into 

its fourth year, dispersing a total of S$52,000 annually for five years for underprivileged students who could thus 

pursue their education and passion without having to worry about their financial issues.

• As we strongly believe that the spirit of innovation and enterprise starts from young, we were pleased to extend 

our inaugural support to two reputable tertiary institutions: 

 – National University of Singapore’s Innovation &amp; Design Centric Programme (iDCP), where we began funding 

students’ projects through a sponsorship of S$300,000 (to be dispersed over five years). With this sponsorship, 

students would be able to engineer and market new ideas, products and technologies that could improve lives, 

enhance productivity, and create opportunities and a better future for Singapore.

Our approach is to build trusted relationships with local communities through contributions and employee 

volunteering.

Students from the National 

University of Singapore’s 

Innovation &amp; Design Centric 

Programme (iDCP) presenting 

their creation, EcoCar, at the 

Shell Eco-marathon Asia 2018 in 

Singapore. The EcoCar project 

is one of many student projects 

funded by Excelpoint Technology 

Ltd. through iDCP.



 – Hong Kong University of Science and Technology’s iSTEAM Robotics Programme 2017 with a sponsorship of 

S$16,800 (HK$100,000). Students would be able to develop experiential learning for various disciplines, such as 

science, technology, engineering, and design, through robotics. 

• We sponsored S$10,000 to Halogen Foundation’s Charity Golf Challenge 2017 event in Singapore, in support of the 

latter’s efforts to help youths in need. Like Halogen Foundation, we also believe in investing in and empowering 

the future of our nation. Hence, we participated in one of the foundation’s core programmes, Network for 

Teaching Entrepreneurship, to educate underprivileged children aged between 15 and 19 about leadership and 

entrepreneurship. In addition, as part of our staff engagement initiatives, we organised a movie night for all our 

staff, and extended a sponsorship of S$10,000 to Halogen Foundation to arrange for a similar event for its staff.

• We donated S$5,000 to the UOB Heartbeat Run/Walk event, which is one of UOB Singapore’s key annual charity 

programmes to help raise funds for the needy.

COMMUNITY



Excelpoint Technology Ltd. donated S$6,574 to 

support Sowers Action’s Sending Love programme 

in 2016, to distribute jackets to school children who 

face harsh winter conditions in Yunnan, China.

FY2016

• The Excelpoint Bursary, in collaboration with Singapore Management University since 2014, continued into its third 

year with a total of S$52,000 dispersed annually for five years for underprivileged students.

• We extended a sponsorship of S$10,000 to Halogen Foundation for its Charity Golf Challenge 2016 event in 

Singapore, in support of its programmes to help youths in need. We worked closely with Halogen Foundation to 

play a part in one of its core programmes, Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship, to educate underprivileged 

children aged between 15 and 19 about leadership and entrepreneurship.

• We donated S$5,000 to the UOB Heartbeat Run/Walk event, which is one of UOB Singapore’s key annual charity 

programmes to help raise funds for the needy. 

• In China, Excelpoint continued to collaborate with Sowers Action on their Sending Love programme, following last 

year's participation. We donated approximately S$6,574 (HKD$36,000) to distribute 300 jackets to disadvantaged 

children in rural regions of China.

FY2015

• Into its second year, the Excelpoint Bursary dispersed a total of S$52,000 annually for five years to help 

underprivileged students from Singapore Management University.

• We sponsored S$10,000 to support Halogen Foundation’s movie screening event in Singapore, where our 

employees got the opportunity to catch an early preview of the movie, Avengers: Age of Ultron. This donation 

helped to fund the foundation’s Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship programme, to educate underprivileged 

children aged between 15 and 19 about leadership and entrepreneurship.

• We were honoured as a Bronze Supporter at Singapore Children’s Society’s Walk for Our Children 2015 event for 

our donation of S$10,000. It was a meaningful event for all our employees as well, as they were not only able to 

help underprivileged children, but also participated in the fun walk and games with their families and enjoyed 

quality time together.

• Excelpoint worked closely with Sowers Action on their Sending Love programme through the donation of S$6,670 

to distribute 300 jackets to disadvantaged children in rural areas of China. The jackets were distributed to several 

schools in Yunnan to shelter children from harsh winter conditions, where temperatures can dip as low as -13 

degree Celsius.
