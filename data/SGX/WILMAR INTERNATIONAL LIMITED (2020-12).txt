About 

this report

We strive to ensure that our sustainability reporting not only 

reflects our progress in our sustainability journey, but that it 

also advances in parallel. Our coverage of information has 

increased to now include all of our key business segments 

(see details in Scope and Boundary below). We are also 

reporting against the Sustainability Accounting Standards 

Board (SASB) Standards and the Task Force on Climate-

related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations 

for the first time, in addition to the Global Reporting 

Initiative (GRI) Standards. 

This report provides a retrospective view of our sustainability 

journey for us to reflect upon, as we continue to identify 

the challenges that we face. Doing this allows us to adapt 

our approach, strengthen our effort and drive continuous 

improvement, so that we can thrive in the long term.

The content is based on our latest materiality assessment 

conducted for the group (see page 171 for details). 

It communicates our sustainability commitments, 

performance and plans going forward. This report is 

intended to be read in conjunction with our Annual Report 

2020 and the sustainability-related disclosures on our  

Sustainability Dashboard.

All photographs featured in this report are of Wilmar's 

people, products and operations.

At Wilmar International Limited (‘Wilmar’), 

we are committed to delivering 

transparency and demonstrating 

accountability to our stakeholders.  

For this, sustainability reporting is key.

statement

Sustainability has always been an important part of our ethos at Wilmar 

and it is at the heart of our business strategy. This report is an opportunity 

for us to  share our sustainability story with our stakeholders: reflecting on 

our journey, including the challenges and opportunities we have faced thus 

far; progressively adapting our approach to further strengthen our efforts 

and drive continuous improvement; and building a thriving business that 

creates long term value for our stakeholders.  

On that note, Wilmar is  emerging as a prominent player in food production, 

growing beyond our position as a leading agriculture business. In line with 

the growth in our business, we have increased the coverage of our report 

to represent all of Wilmar’s key business segments. As part of our firm 

commitment to accountability and transparency, we have also expanded 

our approach to report against the Sustainability Accounting Standards 

Board (SASB) Standards and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 

Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations for the first time, in addition to the 

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. This expanded approach 

also clearly shows our commitment to specific climate change reporting 

and our intention to fully expand our emissions reduction efforts from a 

previously upstream focus.

Dear Stakeholders, 

Wilmar’s Board of Directors is pleased to 

present our 2020 Sustainability Report.

Sustainability Report 2020  |  Wilmar International Limited 

Sustainability Report 2020  |  Wilmar International Limited 

Aside from the lessons learned from COVID-19, 2020 was 

an important year for review and reflection, particularly 

with regard to our NDPE commitments. Since we first 

introduced our NDPE policy in 2013, we have channelled 

substantial resources into delivering on our sustainability 

commitments and are proud of the key milestones we 

have reached. 

Reflecting on our No Deforestation, No Peat  

and No Exploitation (NDPE) commitments

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the world in 

unprecedented ways. While the pandemic has presented 

a major challenge, it has also served to reinforce our view 

that sustainable business practices are crucial to building 

resilience and creating long term value, while helping to 

safeguard the interests of our stakeholders.

Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic

From the early outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we 

quickly recognised the imminent risks to our business and 

our employees. We promptly put in motion, efforts and 

channelled significant resources towards mitigating these 

risks, including developing standard operating procedures 

(SOPs) to ensure our employees as well as our surrounding 

communities were protected. Our swift action also helped 

to ensure business continuity and our ongoing contribution 

to the economy and food security. More importantly, we 

ensured that our employees’ jobs, wages and related 

benefits were secure and not negatively impacted due 

to the pandemic.

Beyond vigilance in our operations, we remained sensitive 

and responsive to the needs of our workforce and their 

families, local communities and governments in countries 

where we operate. In 2020, we channelled over US$15.69 

million towards the provision of food supplies, medical 

equipment and supplies, and financial contributions. We 

also  helped fight the pandemic by diverting the resources 

of some of our R&amp;D laboratories to produce alcohol-based 

hand sanitisers for use by both our workers, as well as 

people in local communities.

During the pandemic, to ensure no children were 

marginalised, we worked closely with our schools and 

teachers to develop and roll out initiatives so that children 

were able to continue to learn despite limitations, such as 

the lack of adequate internet connectivity in the rural areas 

where we operate. Wilmar has long promoted education 

as a means to empower people and tackle poverty. We 

continue to provide funding and institutional support for 

schools in most countries where we operate, including 

China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore, among 

others. This support is especially focused on schools in 

or near our plantation locations, to help ensure children 

of our plantation workers have access to free education. 

Palm oil is a 

people-centric 

business and 

we continue 

to value our 

workers and 

their families.

We have achieved close to 98% traceability to mills, putting 

us on track to reach 100% traceability to mills by 2022. 

Beyond our own supply chain, we have been actively 

engaged in driving the transformation of the rest of the 

industry towards implementing similar commitments. In 

line with our own commitment to a deforestation-free 

supply chain, almost 90% of palm oil and lauric volumes 

to Wilmar’s origin refineries in Malaysia and Indonesia are 

from suppliers that have at least company group level 

commitments and/or action plans in place to address the 

No Deforestation requirements, as per the categorisation 

of supplier mills using the NDPE Implementation Reporting 

Framework (NDPE IRF). Led by Proforest, a global non-

profit organisation that supports sustainable agricultural 

commodity production and sourcing, the NDPE IRF provides 

palm oil companies with an industry-wide approach to 

measure progress in meeting NDPE commitments.  We 

target to expand the scope of the NDPE IRF reporting to 

cover our global palm oil supply chain in 2022.

Overall, deforestation rates in Indonesia continue to decline, 

with over 6.4 million hectares of forests estimated to have 

been spared from oil palm development*. However, we 

recognise that there is still a lot of work to be done on this 

front and we are determined to continue to influence the 

industry to halt deforestation. 

On the social front, palm oil is a people-centric business 

and we continue to value our workers and their families. 

Our ongoing efforts focus on supporting their livelihoods, 

safeguarding their well-being and strengthening labour 

and human rights practices. As of 2020, Women’s Working 

Groups (WoW) or Gender Committees have been set up 

in all of our oil palm plantations in Indonesia, Malaysia, 

Ghana and Nigeria. We have also assessed 100% of our 

employees and contractors to ensure that they are paid 

a living wage.

Sustainability Report 2020  |  Wilmar International Limited 

Sustainability Report 2020  |  Wilmar International Limited 

Despite the challenges brought about by COVID-19, 

Wilmar reported a net profit of US$ 1.53 billion for FY2020, 

a 19% increase (FY2019: US$1.29 billion), on the back 

of robust performance across all core segments. Our 

financial performance is supported by our sustainability 

strategy and on this front, we have also scored several 

achievements and recognitions.

In 2020, Wilmar made its debut in the Dow Jones 

Sustainability Index (DJSI) for Asia Pacific. Other 

sustainability milestones include ranking among the 

top three companies globally in the Sustainability Policy 

Transparency Toolkit (SPOTT) by the Zoological Society 

of London; ranking first in the agriculture sector and third 

across all industries in East Asia and Pacific in the 2020 

Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB); scoring the 

highest in Asia in the 2020 KnowTheChain benchmark. We 

were also assessed to be the best performing company 

for protecting children’s rights in the Global Child Forum 

Our 2020 performance

Southeast Asia 2020 benchmark report, which is the second 

consecutive time Wilmar has received this recognition in 

the regional benchmark.

In 2020, we continued expanding our operations 

internationally. Our China-incorporated subsidiary Yihai 

Kerry Arawana Holdings Co., Ltd was listed on the Shenzhen 

Stock Exchange ChiNext Board in October 2020. As 

our business continues to expand, we are also ensuring 

sustainability practices are upheld consistently across our 

operations. 

One of the ways in which we commit to doing this, is 

through the uptake of sustainability-linked loans (SLL). We 

have obtained several SLLs pegged to our environmental, 

social and governance (ESG) performance with international 

and regional banks, including DBS Bank, Mitsubishi UFJ 

Financial Group, OCBC Bank and United Overseas Bank. 

Our footprint continues to grow as we further expand 

our global business into other agriculture commodities 

and food products. In addition to the increase in our 

responsibilities, our sustainability focus is beginning to 

expand from palm oil and sugar to also include other 

agricultural commodities. As such we will need to manage 

new sustainability-related risks as they emerge and build 

a resilient supply chain.

Our priority for 2021 and beyond is to intensify our 

efforts to engage our stakeholders on sustainability, from 

our suppliers to our end consumers, in an inclusive and 

constructive manner. To collectively push sustainability 

into the mainstream, it is vital that we continue to engage 

our stakeholders – palm oil customers and consumers in 

particular – to understand the sustainability context facing 

the industries we are in, including both the value we create 

and the challenges we still face. Notably on climate change 

efforts, we are focusing on an overall strategy that will 

Looking to the future

BOARD OF DIRECTORS,

WILMAR INTERNATIONAL LIMITED

29 APRIL 2021

begin with a target to reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG) 

emissions intensity by 15% for all our palm oil mills by 2023, 

against our 2016 baseline of 0.82 metric tonnes of carbon 

dioxide equivalent per metric ton of crude palm oil. We 

expect to add on to this target in the coming few years.  

As the world recovers from the global pandemic, we are 

doubling down on our sustainability goals and efforts. 

We are committed to doing our part by taking urgent 

action to avoid catastrophic climate change, as well as 

using our influence and resources to promote sustainable 

development in line with the United Nations Sustainable 

Development Goals. As we turn the page and enter 2021, 

we are optimistic about the future and the opportunities 

we are presented with. We are proud of what Wilmar and 

our people have achieved over the last few years and 

offer our heartfelt thanks to our stakeholders and partners 

who are on this journey with us.  We look forward to their 

continued support.

Our priority for 2021 and beyond 

is to intensify our efforts to 

engage our stakeholders on 

sustainability, from our suppliers 

to our end consumers, in an 

inclusive and constructive manner.

**  The total number of persons housed in our Nigeria palm operations between 2019 and 2020 increased by 16%. The drop from 2019’s reported figure of 31% to 2020’s 27.4% 

is due to several factors: (1) we converted the status of most of our temporary workers to permanent in 2020, resulting in an increase in the total number of permanent workers. 

(2) Our plans for new housing were also disrupted in 2020 due to COVID-19 risks management which includes restriction of movements into plantations and temporary halts to 

new construction activities.

Sustainability Report 2020  |  Wilmar International Limited 

Our approach 

to sustainability 

Sustainability in perspective

The global population is progressively experiencing an 

improvement in quality of life. This is mostly driven by 

increasing wages which, in turn, provide access to better 

education, healthcare and various other benefits and 

opportunities. Higher wages have also led to an increase 

in purchasing power, which is resulting in growing pressure 

on finite resources to fulfil escalating consumer demands. 

There are also growing concerns about the negative risks 

and impacts this will have on natural resources and, more 

importantly, the environment. These concerns include, 

among others, deforestation, forest fires, fresh water scarcity 

and pollution in various forms. A paradigm shift in how 

the world produces, distributes, consumes and disposes 

is essential in order to address these concerns.

Our sustainability focus areas set a clear direction for our 

business while guiding the development of our strategies 

to drive performance across all our business segments. 

They also take into account our material Environmental, 

Social and Governance (ESG) topics, which were updated 

in 2020. For details on the materiality assessment process, 

please refer to page 171.

Our No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation (NDPE) 

Policy is the blueprint for our global operations and our 

supply chain, which is further strengthened by our other 

sustainability-related policies and frameworks. These cover 

the environment, health and safety, equal opportunities, 

human rights, labour rights, women empowerment, child 

protection and food safety and can be accessed on our 

Sustainability Dashboard. 

WILMAR’S SUSTAINABILITY AGENDA 

FOCUSES ON FOUR MAIN AREAS:

PROTECTING THE 

ENVIRONMENT

LOOKING AFTER 

PEOPLE AND 

COMMUNITIES

DELIVERING 

PRODUCT 

EXCELLENCE

TRANSFORMING 

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN



Fulfilling our 

commitments

DELIVERING OUR SUSTAINABILITY POLICY 

COMMITMENTS IS AN ONGOING ENDEAVOUR 

THAT HINGES ON FIVE KEY PILLARS:

STAKEHOLDER 

ENGAGEMENT

CERTIFICATION

SUPPLY CHAIN 

TRACEABILITY

CONSERVATION 

AND BIODIVERSITY

TRANSPARENCY 

AND REPORTING

The agriculture and food industries have always represented 

the backbone of society. They support lives and livelihoods 

by addressing food security while driving economies to 

generate employment opportunities. These sectors have 

also begun to demonstrate how they can play a major 

role in supporting this paradigm shift through their own 

efforts and initiatives.

As a global integrated agriculture and food company 

with a presence across the value chain, Wilmar is in a 

strategic position to leverage our resources, experience 

and expertise to address these shared concerns. At the 

same time, we remain steadfast in our commitment to 

deliver responsible and sustainable agriculture and feed 

products that safeguard the well-being of both, people and 

the planet. Sustainability is at the heart of our operations 

and our business-as-usual.

Stakeholder Engagement

Our sustainability ambitions are shared across sectors 

and stakeholder groups, which is why Wilmar values 

input from stakeholders and commits to proactive and 

constructive engagement. Our stakeholders have been 

identified as those on whom our operations have a 

significant impact; those with a vested interest in our 

sustainability performance; and those in public positions 

who influence our activities. They include governments, 

local communities, smallholders, employees, civil society 

organisations (CSOs), certification bodies, customers, 

financial institutions, industry bodies, shareholders and 

the investing public, suppliers, our sustainability partners 

and collaborators. 

We strive to ensure that it is a two-way process when 

engaging our stakeholders. We welcome their feedback and 

input just as much as we look forward to proactively sharing 

our progress updates. This provides our stakeholders with 

a clear avenue to question or raise concerns on Wilmar or 

our suppliers. We established our Grievance Procedure 

to allow stakeholders to raise any sustainability-related 

grievances through a rigorous and transparent resolution 

process. Further details on our Grievance Procedure can be 

found in the section on Transforming our Supply Chain.



For more information on our engagements with stakeholders, key issues or concerns raised and our 

response, refer to the stakeholder engagement section of our Sustainability Dashboard.



We are 

committed 

to delivering 

sustainable 

agriculture and 

food products 

that safeguard 

the well-being 

of both people 

and the planet.

Sustainability Report 2020  |  Wilmar International Limited 



MULTI-STAKEHOLDER INITIATIVES

Sustainability issues often require a multi-stakeholder 

approach to be addressed properly and practically. 

Hence, it is key that we actively participate and, more 

importantly, contribute in various relevant multi-stakeholder 

initiatives. This provides us with the opportunity to be part 

of developing or revising industry-level or topic specific 

standards, while also leverage on these organisations’ 

capabilities to keep abreast of emerging trends and best 

practices.

• 

As a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable 

Palm Oil (RSPO) since its inception in 2004, we have 

been an active participant in various RSPO working 

groups over the years. We have representations within 

the RSPO, which include the Board of Governors, 

the Smallholder Support Fund Panel, the Steering 

Committee for the Sabah Jurisdictional Approach for 

Sustainable Palm Oil Production, the Fresh Fruit Bunch 

(FFB) Legality &amp; Traceability Taskforce, the Shared 

Responsibility Working Group, the Biodiversity and 

High Conservation Values (BHCV) Working Group, 

the Compensation Task Force (CTF) as well as the 

Human Rights Working Group, which includes the 

related Taskforce on Labour and the Taskforce on 

Decent Living Wage.

• 

We are also members of the European Palm Oil 

Alliance (EPOA), Tropical Forest Alliance (TFA), Fire 

Free Alliance (FFA), Grow Asia and Grow Africa. 

• 

Wilmar joined Bonsucro as a member in 2014 and 

through our membership, we are committed to the 

development of sustainable sugar. 

Reporting and Transparency

Supply Chain Traceability

Conservation

Monitoring and reporting our progress transparently and 

regularly is essential in demonstrating our commitment to 

operating a responsible and sustainable business. Aside 

from our Annual Reports and Sustainability Reports, the 

Wilmar Sustainability Dashboard is also consistently 

updated with information related to certification, 

conservation, supply chain monitoring and NDPE 

compliance, grievances, traceability and more.

We are also constantly assessed and included in various 

sustainability indices and benchmark ratings, which include 

the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), Corporate Human 

Rights Benchmark (CHRB), Dow Jones Sustainability Index 

(DJSI), Global Child Forum (GCF), KnowTheChain Food 

and Beverage Benchmark and the Sustainable Policy 

Transparency Toolkit (SPOTT) by the Zoological Society 

of London (ZSL). External assessments and benchmarking 

such as these are important to us as they help identify 

potential gaps or risks in our approach and performance, 

while holding us accountable to our stakeholders. They 

also play a role in acknowledging our positive efforts, which 

further encourages us as it provides assurance that we are 

heading down the right path.

Traceability allows us to map our supply chain and gain 

in-depth knowledge on the origins of our raw materials, 

which is fundamentally important for the implementation 

of our sustainability commitments within our supply chain. 

In addition to providing greater transparency, supply chain 

traceability allows us to identify the suppliers linked to 

our operations, thus enabling us to develop ongoing 

partnerships for improvements while monitoring compliance 

against our sustainability commitments.

We recognise the unique role and responsibility of upstream 

industries in the landscapes where they operate. Wilmar 

took the opportunity to demonstrate this responsibility 

through our own ongoing conservation activities and 

investments, as we firmly believe in leading by example.

Wilmar was among the early adopters of identifying High 

Conservation Value (HCV) areas and establishing these 

areas as protected zones. They house key wildlife species 

while also providing critical landscape level services such 

as water catchments. To date, we have identified and 

set aside 31,640 hectares of land for conservation in 

Indonesia, Malaysia, Ghana, Nigeria – almost 10% of our 

total landbank.

Similarly, we encourage our suppliers to identify areas for 

protection using the integrated HCV and High Carbon 

Stock Approach (HCSA) methodology, as outlined in our 

NDPE Policy. Through a combination of satellite monitoring 

and grievance reporting, we ensure our NDPE Policy is 

implemented by our own operations as well as that of 

our suppliers. 

We believe that 

engagement 

with our 

stakeholders 

is a two-way 

process.

We recognise 

our unique role 

and responsibility 

in steering the 

industry towards 

more sustainable 

agricultural and 

food production 

practices.

COLLABORATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS

We are also continuously looking for new partnerships and 

opportunities to collaborate with others who can help us 

to deliver on our commitments. Some of our key ongoing 

partnerships include biodiversity and conservation initiatives 

with research institutions and CSOs, R&amp;D programmes with 

academic and national research centres across the world to 

optimise process efficiencies and enhance product quality, 

as well as social diversity and community programmes with 

local partners. Details on some of our key partnerships are 

disclosed throughout the various sections of this Report.

Certification

Certification plays an important role in providing our 

customers and consumers with the confidence that our 

products are of high safety, quality and sustainability 

standards. We actively work towards obtaining relevant 

certifications. These include certifications by the RSPO, 

the Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO), the Malaysian 

Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) and the International 

Sustainability Carbon Certification (ISCC) for palm oil 

and certification by Bonsucro and the Smartcane Best 

Management Practices (BMP) for sugar.

• 

To ensure that we produce responsible soy products, 

we are members of the Round Table on Responsible 

Soy (RTRS) Association.

• 

Through our consumer product businesses, Sugar 

Australia and Goodman Fielder, we are part of the 

REDcycle scheme in Australia and the Soft Plastic 

Recycling Scheme in New Zealand.

Our food production facilities are certified by the Global 

Food Safety initiative (GFSI), which is an accredited 

certification scheme for food safety. We also adopt a 

number of certification schemes such as ISO 22716:2007 

for non-food products.

For our animal feed products, the majority follow the GMP+ 

certification scheme. We are also beginning the Hazard 

Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) certification process 

for retail products.

Protecting the 

environment

Given our reliance on natural resources including land, 

water and energy to grow and produce agriculture and 

food, we must operate within our planetary boundaries. 

We are especially conscious of fragile ecosystems within 

our surrounding areas. We continue focusing our efforts to 

protect High Carbon Stock (HCS) forest, High Conservation 

Value (HCV) areas and peatland, taking actions on 

climate change, minimising our operational footprint and 

developing sustainable packaging solutions.

It is imperative that we play an active part 

in safeguarding our environment.

Biodiversity  

and conservation

Indonesia and Malaysia house some of the world’s richest 

biodiversity. They are also the two primary locations for 

our palm oil upstream operations. That is why we channel 

resources towards protecting and restoring HCV and 

HCS areas, together with other ecologically and culturally 

important lands, as we strive to ensure that our supply 

chain is deforestation-free.

Identifying and conserving  

HCV areas and HCS forests

103-1,103-2, 103-3, 304-1, 304-2, 304-3, 304-4

As of December 2020, a total of 31,640 hectares in Wilmar 

oil palm plantations, which is almost 10% of our total 

landbank, are conservation areas. We added an additional 

335 hectares to our HCV areas in Calaro and Ibad, Nigeria, 

in 2020.

We apply the High Conservation Value Network (HCVN) 

and High Carbon Stock Approach (HCSA) toolkit to help 

us identify and conserve HCV and HCS areas, especially 

for new land developments by Wilmar or our third-party 

suppliers as required by our No Deforestation, No Peat, 

No Exploitation (NDPE) Policy.

Our NDPE policy was updated in November 2018 and 

is further aligned with the revised RSPO Principles and 

Criteria (P&amp;C) that requires all new land developments 

after 15 November 2018 to undergo combined HCV and 

HCSA assessments.

The integrated HCV-HCS assessments must be led by 

licensed HCV assessors accredited by HCVN Assessor 

Licensing Scheme (ALS). Thus, to build and strengthen our 

internal capacity, 14 members of the Wilmar sustainability 

team underwent training and passed the Integrated HCV-

HCSA Assessor Training in 2020. In total, we currently have 

16 employees who are qualified as HCSA practitioners, as 

well as one licensed ALS HCV/HCS Assessor who supports 

HCV-HCSA related work.

All identified HCV and HCS areas are monitored and 

managed as conservation areas, following assessments 

conducted to date for our palm oil operations. Within 

our conservation areas, we identified various types of 

wildlife, including animals and plants from the Red List 

of Threatened Species by the International Union for 

Conservation of Nature (IUCN). More information on this 

can be found on Wilmar’s Sustainability Dashboard.

OTHER CONSERVATION SET ASIDE AREAS

We have also embarked on conservation efforts outside 

of our oil palm plantations. In our sugar plantations in 

Australia, we identified and are conserving 675 hectares 

of vegetation, which is categorised as ‘endangered’ or ‘of 

concern’. In India, the entire periphery of our mills and 

plants, making up 33% of our compound areas, are green 

belts planted with native tree species. We planted over 

9,000 trees, totalling 151 hectares, at seven of our mills 

throughout 2018 and 2019.

We also recognise the important role played by our workers, 

as well as local and indigenous communities, which is why 

we developed a range of programmes to raise awareness 

while building capacity to further strengthen our ongoing 

conservation efforts.

CONSERVATION EFFORTS BASED ON LOCAL 

WISDOM “LUBUK LARANGAN”

We recognise and respect the important role 

that local and indigenous communities play in 

conservation, particularly in protecting forests as 

they often inhabit these landscapes. We began 

partnering with the indigenous communities of 

Sei Talao and Sei Kunyit to benefit from their local 

knowledge and traditional wisdom in helping 

us to protect our conservation area within PT 

Kencana Sawit (PT KSI) in Sumatra, Indonesia. 

The key focus from this collaborative effort is 

to preserve the water quality of the river, which 

serves as an important source of water and fish 

for the communities, by protecting the riparian 

zones from chemicals.

Their Minang tribe local wisdom embraces the 

importance of protecting the natural resouces in 

the river. They have indicated forbidden areas of 

the river, known as Lubuk Larangan, which can 

only be cultivated based on the decision of the 

community leader, known as Ninik Mamak. This 

practice conserves the fish population in the river, 

aside from preventing potential encroachment 

by surrounding communities. There are currently 

two Lubuk Larangan areas within our PT KSI 

plantation, both of which were implemented 

and are being managed collaboratively between 

the members of the community, the community 

leader and with the full support from PT KSI.

We have notified our employees and their 

families about the Lubuk Larangan and have 

installed signboard prohibiting encroachment and 

illegal fishing in these areas.

CENTRALISED DATABASE SYSTEM FOR 

CONSERVATION MONITORING AND 

MANAGEMENT

Effectively protecting conservation areas 

is a complex task that requires a suite of 

processes. One important part is the long-

term monitoring of our conservation areas, 

through consistent and accurate data, in 

order to understand the effectiveness of our 

programmes on the ground. 

Wilmar has started to standardise our 

protocols for the long term management of 

data. Having a centralised database system is 

important in improving our ability to archive, 

search and analyse important conservation 

data. In turn, this will help us to continue 

implementing successful conservation and 

monitoring programmes. 

We currently have two different databases. 

SMART serves as our monitoring 

database. Our internal HCV Management 

Implementation Dashboard contains details 

on all our HCV management programmes, 

including restoration, signboard installations, 

marking poles, boreholes and socialisation 

efforts. Through this dashboard, we can easily 

quantify the progress and success of our 

management plans for each plantation and 

identify areas for improvement.

MONITORING CONSERVATION AREAS  

USING SMART

Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART) 

is an open source and freely available software 

to help better monitor and patrol protected 

landscapes. As part of our efforts to improve the 

monitoring of our conservation areas, Wilmar 

has been using the SMART Patrol System since 

2013, when it was originally being piloted in 

collaboration with the Zoological Society of 

London (ZSL). 

SMART provides four main data retrieval 

components, including: 1) Location spatial data; 

2) Date and time of patrol; 3) Observation data of 

wildlife in HCV areas; 4) Human activities in HCV 

areas such as encroachment and illegal logging.

SMART can also be used as a database system to 

compile and compare year-on-year data. With this 

system, trend analysis can help to identify HCV 

areas and encroachment within our plantation 

areas and immediate mitigation actions can be 

taken. In addition, we can easily evaluate and 

adapt our management and monitoring plan 

Conservation 

activities in 

Indonesia

using five key steps: 1) Collecting patrol data 

from our field team; 2) Data input to the system; 

3) Data processing and mapping; 4) Reporting 

and evaluation with plantation management; 5) 

Developing plans to manage HCV area based on 

the findings.

Since adopting this system, we recorded more 

than 7,629 data patrols, 15,439 field photo 

activities related to the findings, 9,522 wildlife 

where 207 were rare, threatened or endangered 

(RTE) species, including the Pongo pygmaeus 

wurmbii (the Borneo Orangutan).

WILDLIFE AWARENESS OUTREACH 

PROGRAMME (WAOP) 

WAOP is among our key conservation 

programmes to raise awareness on the 

importance of biodiversity conservation. 

Since 2018, together with CSOs and 

government departments, we have engaged 

over 2,700 stakeholders, comprising our 

workers, local communities and students 

living in the vicinity of our oil palm plantations 

in Sabah and Sarawak.

WAOP also aims to inculcate interest in 

environmental protection among the younger 

generation. We are currently exploring the 

Conservation 

activities in 

Malaysia



development of a ‘Junior Ranger’ programme  

with SK Suai 2, the government school near  

our plantations. 

The programme, which is an extension of the WAOP, 

will involve activities such as awareness talks, tree 

planting, field visits and many others.

WAOP has other engagements with SK Suai 2, which 

includes organising overnight field trips for primary 

six students to the Niah National Park. A total of 

67 participants joined the visit, accompanied by 

our Wildlife Rangers and representatives from the 

Sarawak Forestry Corporation.







SEKAR IMEJ CONSERVATION AREA (SICA)

SICA is Wilmar’s largest HCV area in Malaysia and 

is poised to function as a biodiversity and carbon 

research centre by 2030. Additional areas are being 

connected to be included as part of the SICA project, 

covering a total area of 2,469 hectares.

The SICA project objectives include: 

1. 

Positioning SICA as a leading research centre on 

biodiversity and carbon management.

2. 

Developing solutions that strengthen the 

management of conservation areas and 

protection of biodiversity.

3. 

Connecting existing HCV areas to create a larger 

integrated ecosystem network. 

4. 

Developing livelihood opportunities for local 

communities within the research centre as well as 

through low impact livelihoods programme. 

The SICA team has begun prepping for future 

research works, aside from the ongoing conservation 

and rehabilitation efforts. The project has gained 

support from various stakeholders, especially 

from local communities. In 2020, Wilmar signed a 

Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Universiti 

Sains Malaysia (USM) to collaborate on biodiversity 

conservation research projects, with SICA as a key 

priority area.

Conserving and protecting peatland

Fire prevention, 

monitoring and suppression 

Peatlands play an important role in climate change, given 

its ability to store more carbon than all other vegetation 

types combined. Peatlands are also highly prone to catching 

fire, if drained or faced with dry conditions. 

Wilmar strictly prohibits any new development on 

peatlands, regardless of depth, since the launch of our 

NDPE policy. Where feasible, we explore options for peat 

restoration by working with expert stakeholders and local 

communities, as we recognise the significant opportunities 

and benefits from it, which includes reducing greenhouse 

gas (GHG) emissions.

Approximately 2,420# hectares, which is about 1% of our 

total planted area, is classified as peat.  In these planted 

areas, we apply best management practices defined by peat 

experts together with the RSPO. This includes maintaining 

water tables at optimal levels to minimise peat subsidence 

and to minimise the release of carbon dioxide.

We also have 1,090 hectares of peatlands in our 

conservation areas, of which 90% or 983 hectares, are 

located within our operations in Sumatra, Indonesia. 

We also participate and contribute towards peatland 

conservation targets and efforts by the Indonesian Peatland 

Restoration Agency (Badan Restorasi Gambut) as well 

as in knowledge-sharing platform and multi-stakeholder 

initiatives, such as the Tropical Forest Alliance (TFA).

Forest fires are a persisting issue in Indonesia. This is 

particularly the case during dry seasons or when faced 

with climate patterns such as El Nino, both of which have 

caused catastrophic fires on several occasions over the 

years. The fires typically result in a thick layer of haze that 

significantly impacts air quality, affecting not only Indonesia 

but its neighbouring countries as well. The haze presents a 

major threat to public health but also to the environment 

and economies.

Similarly, Australia has been experiencing severe bush 

fires in recent years, caused by long periods of drought 

together with bouts of high temperatures. The bushfires 

in 2019 and 2020 were considered to be one of the worst 

in recent times. They destroyed natural habitats, as well 

as towns and residences, while affecting air quality and 

resulting in fatalities across both humans and wildlife. 

For details on our relief efforts, see the Economic and 

Community Contribution section of this Report.

Wilmar adheres to a strict zero-burn policy, opting instead 

to deploy mechanical methods for land development and 

preparation. The wood debris is left to decompose and 

subsequently feed the land with nutrients, which reduces 

our reliance on inorganic fertilisers, while also reducing our 

GHG emissions. This policy also applies to our third-party 

suppliers, which is why we take a strong stance against 

the illegal use of fire for land clearing in our supply chain.

In Myanmar, our operations use an overhead irrigation 

system and do not apply burning methods for harvesting. 

In India, while we do not own farming operations, our 

mills engage and encourage our smallholder suppliers to 

avoid burning. These engagements include conducting 

awareness programmes to raise further understanding on 

the risks related to using fire in their operations.

On rare occasions, when burning is absolutely necessary, 

it is done under strict and prescribed circumstances. An 

example of this is in the Burdekin region of Queensland, 

Australia, where sugarcanes are too leafy to cut due to 

an abundance of water. Cutting green and leaving cane 

trash blanket on the ground also obstructs waterflow, 

causing poor irrigation. We therefore permit burning in 

the sugarcane plantations, adhering to all applicable local 

laws and regulations and implementing our own robust 

fires standard operating procedures (SOPs). In 2020, a 

total of 2,925 hectares were burnt using prescribed and 

controlled methods in our sugar operations.

We take a 

strong

stance against 

the illegal 

use of fire for 

clearing land 

in our supply 

chain.

and Nigeria operations

Sustainability Report 2020  |  Wilmar International Limited 

Sustainability Report 2020  |  Wilmar International Limited 

We formalised our internal protocol to better prevent, 

monitor, suppress and report fire incidences in 2019, which 

is now being implemented in all of our operating units.

In Indonesia, we monitor fires within and surrounding our 

palm oil operations through the Fire Free Alliance (FFA), 

a multi-stakeholder initiative to mitigate the risk of fires 

through prevention, early detection, quick suppression and 

reporting. Since joining the FFA, Wilmar has completed fire 

risk maps for our concessions to help us plan and monitor 

activities, especially in high-risk areas. We also monitor 

areas up to 5 kilometres outside our boundaries. 

Using satellite imageries, we monitor and identify hotspot 

alerts on a daily basis. All alerts received require on-ground 

verification because satellites capture fluctuations in 

temperature that do not necessarily translate to fires in 

the field. 

Hotspot notifications located within and up to 5 kilometres 

outside of Wilmar’s concession boundaries will be shared 

by our Geographic Information System (GIS) team with the 

relevant on-site team. A team comprising members from 

GIS, Conservation and Management in Wilmar is then 

mobilised to verify the satellite imagery data.

In 2020, we began using an integrated fire monitoring 

platform that automatically downloads hotspot data and 

relays it to our field managers using a web-based instant 

messaging application. The platform was developed 

internally by the Wilmar GIS team. Our field teams also 

conduct daily on-ground fire monitoring that has proven 

very effective at times in detecting and suppressing fires 

even before detection by satellite.

We also work closely with the RSPO in sharing fire-

related data and verifying fire alerts through the RSPO 

Hotspot Monitoring Programme. Our response teams are 

immediately dispatched to extinguish fires once they are 

confirmed incidences.

In 2020, a total of 31 hotspots were detected within 

our operations in Indonesia, with 27# fires recorded and 

affecting an area of about 70.58# hectares.  Within the 5km 

area beyond our concessions, 823 hotspots were identified, 

of which 123 were confirmed as actual fires. The total area 

affected by the fire occurrences is about 390.16 hectares.

It is important to acknowledge the range of external 

factors outside of our control, such as weather conditions, 

when evaluating the effectiveness of our fire mitigation 

programmes. Hence, we compared our 2020 data with 

2017, given the comparable levels of rainfall, averaging 

at 3,159mm in 2017 and 3,429mm in 2020. Under these 

somewhat similar weather conditions, we detected a slight 

increase of 17.4% fire occurrences in 2020, but with a 77% 

reduction in the affected areas within our concessions. 

Our effort to prevent, detect and suppress fires has 

improved significantly. However, we recognise that there 

is still more work to be done, especially in reducing fires 

that occur outside of our concession boundaries. Fire 

occurrences within a 5km radius of Wilmar’s concessions 

increased significantly from 28 in 2017 to 123 in 2020, 

by 339%. The land area affected by fires also increased 

by 67%. Putting this into context: the land area affected 

by fires is proportionally lower than fire occurrences. This 

demonstrates that once fires are detected, we are able to 

mobilise our teams to suppress them quickly, before they 

spread further afield, affecting large areas of land. 

Our hotspot alerts are 

identified via satellite 

imageries, which are 

monitored daily.

NOTE: There 

were no fires in 

our concessions in 

Malaysia, Ghana 

and Nigeria.

NOTE: There were 

no fires within fire 

buffer zones of

Our Supplier Group Compliance Programme (SGCP) 

enables us to extend our monitoring efforts to our suppliers. 

We immediately seek clarification from relevant suppliers 

upon receiving fire alerts from our monitoring platform  or 

in the media. Detailed description of our SGCP is in the 

section on Transforming our Supply Chain.

MINIMISING RISK IN SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES 

Local communities, including smallholders, continue 

to practise slash-and-burn methods for land clearance 

and preparation. This is because it is perceived to be 

cost-effective, requires minimal labour and enriches soil 

fertility, according to traditional agricultural practices 

and wisdom. Slash-and-burn practices are also legal in 

Indonesia, within certain limits and conditions, for farmers 

with less than two hectares of land. Regrettably, these fires 

occasionally become uncontrollable and spread mercilessly 

to neighbouring lands and plantations.

Thus, efforts to engage local communities and raise 

awareness on the risks of using fires for land clearance 

and preparation are key components in our FFA fire 

management programmes. Wilmar has socialised the ‘Fire-

Free Community’ programme to 142 villages in Sumatra 

and Kalimantan, Indonesia, since joining the FFA in 2016.

Improving yield and extraction rates 

An updated study by members of the IUCN Palm Oil Task 

Force indicated that palm oil commands an estimated 40% 

of the global vegetable oil supply, but only occupies about 

5.5% of the total oil crop land area. This makes oil palms 

the most productive oil crop, with the most efficient use 

of land. Yet, as demand for palm oil continues to grow 

globally, so do concerns around deforestation. We continue 

to explore opportunities to meet this growing demand, 

without having to further expand or develop new land 

areas through ongoing attempts to improve our yield and 

extraction rate.

Cloning propagation is a method using tissue culture that 

identifies and selects individual oil palm variations that 

are favourable in terms of yield performance and other 

parameters suitable for mass cloning. Since 2009, we 

have been operating our clonal lab in Cikarang, Bekasi, 

Indonesia, with the capacity to produce 200,000 clonal 

palms annually. Through clonal varieties, we expect yield 

to improve between 13% and 32%.

For more information on our R&amp;D efforts to improve yield 

and extraction rates, see the Innovation and Technology 

section of this Report.

Climate-related risk and opportunities

103-1,103-2, 103-3, 201-2, FB-AG-110A.2, FB-AG-440A.1 

We recognise the threat of climate change and its effect 

on the planet and livelihoods. Unpredictable and extreme 

weather patterns directly impact agriculture operations, 

including Wilmar, and are a risk to food production. 

Hence our previous focus on climate change was on our 

upstream agricultural operations, in oil palm and sugarcane 

production, where we still believe there is the biggest 

impact. As the world transitions to a low-carbon economy, 

we are now expanding the focus throughout our global 

business. We continue doing our part to mitigate climate 

change, while identifying risks and opportunities to build 

resilience for our business. 

Wilmar’s company-wide Enterprise Risk Management 

(ERM) process assesses climate-related risks on a regular 

basis. Risks are then reported to the Group’s Sustainability 

Department for further analysis and the development of 

mitigation and adaptation measures.

The Risk Management Committee (RMC) regularly reviews 

the overall risk management guidelines, policies and 

systems to determine the potential financial or strategic 

impact of the risks identified, before recommending risk 

tolerance limits. 

Through our ERM process and scenario analysis study, we 

have considered eight types of risks in our climate-related 

risk assessments over the short, medium and long term 

which covers more than three years.

Some of the climate-related risks identified on the next

REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS IN OUR UPSTREAM 

PALM OIL OPERATIONS

GHG emissions reduction in our palm oil business is 

primarily achieved by generating electricity from biomass, 

treating palm oil mill effluent (POME), halting deforestation 

and employing best practices on cultivated peatland. In 

addition to our own efforts, our suppliers are also expected 

to adopt climate change mitigation practices in line with 

our NDPE commitments.

We met our target to construct 25 methane capture 

facilities at our Crude Palm Oil (CPO) mills. With all of them 

operational in 2020, we were able to avoid 598,435 tCO2e 

of total GHG emissions for the year. Recovered biogas is 

used mainly for power generation while any excess is flared 

off to minimise leakage. We also generate electricity in our 

palm oil mills by using biomass, which includes by-products 

from the milling process such as empty fruit bunches (EFB), 

kernel shells and mill fibre.

For more information on how we protect forests and 

manage peatlands, see the section on Biodiversity and 

Conservation.

Climate change mitigation

We are committed to progressively reducing greenhouse 

gas (GHG) emissions from our operations to manage 

climate-related transition risks, while supporting global 

efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change. All our 

business segments are focused on reducing GHG emissions 

through various initiatives.

REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS IN OUR UPSTREAM 

SUGAR BUSINESS

Our sugar operations in Australia and India also make 

use of biomass to generate renewable electricity. Cane 

bagasse, a by-product from crushing sugarcane, is the 

main source of fuel powering our mills. In addition to 

providing us with renewable energy, we are able to sell 

more than 50% of the energy generated to the national 

grid. In Australia, we are the largest generator of renewable 

biomass energy. Our Australian and New Zealand sugar 

refining operations also have undertaken a number of 

emissions reduction initiatives over recent years. The sugar 

refineries are currently mapping an Energy and Greenhouse 

Gas Reduction Pathway towards a low emissions future.







SCENARIO ANALYSIS

In 2018, the Wilmar Group conducted a qualitative 

scenario analysis to identify the possible impacts 

climate change can have on our business. The 

analysis was mainly focused on our upstream 

operations and supply chain, which are more 

susceptible to negative climate impacts in a two-

degrees Celsius (2DS) scenario.   

The analysis, which was presented to the RMC, 

revealed a potential reduction of FFB supply due 

to prolonged droughts. Recommendations to 

manage these risks were proposed to the Board 

for consideration, which influenced strategy and 

financial planning. 

Apart from risks, we also identified climate-related 

opportunities, which may have substantial financial 

or strategic gains for our business. For example, 

regulations on the use of renewable energy may 

drive the demand for sustainable biofuels or 

biodiesels. The use of biogas generated from palm 

oil mill effluents can also reduce our dependency 

on diesel for electricity generation, thus cutting our 

emissions and operational cost.

In the future, we will look to conduct a more in-

depth quantitative scenario analysis, covering our 

downstream operations.

REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS 

IN OUR FACTORIES

Climate change adaptation

To reduce our reliance on electricity from the grid and 

non-renewable sources in our factories, we have a number 

of initiatives in place. 

For example, our subsidiary Yihai Kerry Arawana (YKA) 

recycles our wastewater and sewage, collecting 9.4 

million cubic metres of biogas for energy consumption 

and replacing the use of 6,700 tonnes of standard coal 

equivalent, therefore reducing our carbon emissions by 

approximately 200,900 metric tonnes of CO2e.  YKA also 

switched to natural gas instead of coal in many of our 

factories and has built integrated factories to reduce 

resource and energy usage. Going forward, YKA is 

committed to aligning with China’s pledge to reach carbon 

neutrality before 2060.

Our subsidiary Goodman Fielder has also undertaken a 

number of emissions reduction initiatives in recent years. 

In Fiji, we have generated over 1000 megawatt hours of 

renewable electricity through 320 kilowatts peak solar 

installation. In New Zealand, our factories have achieved a 

17% reduction in scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions over 

the last five years through a combination of operational 

efficiencies and capital investment.  This includes New 

Zealand's only two “boiler-less bakeries” which, through the 

innovative use of heat recovery technology, have reduced 

natural gas consumption by over 20%. 

The ongoing network transformation programme in New 

Zealand is also optimising the distribution of our products 

across the country, reducing diesel consumption. The 

project is designed to deliver GHG emissions savings of 

over 1,700 metric tonnes CO2e.

In addition, four Goodman Fielder sites are participating in 

the Energy Transition Accelerator programme by the Energy 

Efficiency &amp; Conservation Authority (EECA). These sites will 

develop a roadmap towards zero emissions.  Opportunities 

identified through this initiative will be rolled out across 

the organisation.

As part of a wider sustainability strategy to be launched 

in the first half of 2021, Goodman Fielder is announcing 

two climate-related targets:

• 

Use 100% renewable electricity by 2025

• 

Achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2040

Building towards this commitment, since January 2021 

Goodman Fielder has used 100% renewable electricity 

in New Zealand, through the purchase of Renewable 

Energy Certificates (REC) in line with the RE100 technical 

guidelines. This year we will also be investing in a new 

heat-recovery project at our Longburn Dairy, delivering 

about 1,000 metric tonnes CO2e emission savings.

Climate change impacts are already being felt in various 

parts of the world, affecting the food and agriculture 

sectors. For example, unpredictable weather patterns, 

including prolonged droughts or periods of heavy rainfall, 

will increasingly affect the productivity of our crops. In 

addition to playing our part in reducing GHG emissions 

it is imperative that as a business, we set a path towards 

climate change adaptation to build resilience for the future.

To manage these risks in our upstream palm oil operations, 

we invested heavily in the R&amp;D of palm seedlings that 

are more resilient to extreme weather patterns. These 

seedlings are also sold to smallholders and smaller 

plantation companies to ensure the reliability of future 

supplies to our mills.

Wilmar takes a long term holistic approach to sustainability 

that is fully integrated into our business model. Globally, 

customers are increasingly favouring and shifting towards 

responsibly and sustainably produced commodities, so 

this has allowed us to remain competitive and fulfil market 

expectations. Our sustainability approach is also pivotal 

in managing transition risks, such as our reputation and 

market access.

We are actively investing in R&amp;D to identify environmentally 

friendly solutions and address the growing demand for 

sustainable products. Examples include: developing plant-

based protein to reduce reliance on beef; and producing 

soaps and detergents using vegetable-based surfactants 

which are more consumer and environmentally friendly. 

Our GHG emissions

In 2020, our total scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions were 

11,234,191 metric tonnes CO2e and our GHG emissions 

intensity was 127.98 kg CO2e per metric ton of products. 

This represents a 5% drop from our 2019 emissions intensity 

of 128.90 kg CO2e per metric ton of products which can be 

attributed to our emission reductions at oil palm plantations 

and palm oil mills. The reduced fertiliser inputs in 2020 led 

to a 23% reduction of our oil palm plantations’ emissions 

intensity while the continued efforts to operate our methane 

capture plants at maximum efficiency resulted in a 15% 

drop for palm oil mills’ emissions intensity. The majority of 

our emissions come from our factories and upstream palm 

oil operations. Our biogenic emissions were 10,866,823 

metric tonnes of CO2e.

We have set a target to reduce our GHG emissions intensity 

by 15% for all of our palm oil mills by 2023, against our 

2016 baseline of 0.82 metric tonnes of CO2e per metric 

ton of CPO. This target applies to all our mills in Indonesia, 

Malaysia, Ghana and Nigeria, regardless of certification 

status. With an emissions intensity of 0.62 metric tonnes 

of CO2e per metric ton of CPO in 2020, we have met our 

target earlier than expected with the main driver coming 

from our methane capture plants.

NOTE: Scope 1 and 2 emissions are calculated based on the GHG Protocol, the world’s most widely used GHG accounting 

standards for companies and include the following gases: CO2, CH4 and N2O. The GWP rates used are from the IPCC Fifth 

Assessment Report (AR5). The financial control approach is used to consolidate GHG emissions. Non-manufacturing sites 

such as headquarters/offices are excluded.





In 2020, YKA and Yihua Technology  

reached an agreement to construct 

photovoltaic (PV) power plants in all  

of our factories across China.

In the Taizhou factory, a 1.557MWp PV 

station was built on the roof of the building, 

generating power of up to 1,228,536KWh 

and reducing GHG emissions by 1,057.5 

metric tonnes CO2e. By the end of 2021, the 

group will build a distributed PV station of 

more than 110MWp, with an annual power 

generation of more than 109 million kWh. In 

addition, the design and construction of PV 

power generation projects are taking into 

consideration sustainable resources such as 

clean energy during the building phase.

  GOVERNANCE

  STRATEGY

TCFD’S KEY PILLARS

WILMAR’S APPROACH

 Wilmar’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is responsible 

for the oversight of the company’s Integrated Policy which covers 

climate-related issues.

 Climate-related risk management is incorporated into the Group's 

risk management structure, comprising the Board's Risk Management 

Committee at the Board level, which reviews general sustainability 

issues (including climate-related items) on a quarterly basis.

 A sustainability paper, signed-off by the General Manager (GM) 

of Group Sustainability and Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), which 

includes updates on the overall approach to the management of 

climate-related risks as well as progress on implementation against 

set goals, is presented by the CSO to the Board’s Risk Management 

Committee on a quarterly basis for review.

 The finalised issues and recommendations are discussed with the 

Board of Directors for their approval.

 These issues are taken into consideration as the Board reviews and 

guides the Company’s strategy and financial planning.

 In 2018, Wilmar conducted a qualitative scenario analysis to identify 

the possible impacts climate change can have on the company, focusing 

mainly on upstream operations and our supply chain which are more 

susceptible to negative impacts in a two-degrees Celsius (2DS) scenario.

 Our internal risk assessments have identified relevant climate change 

risks and opportunities, which informed our sustainability strategy and 

the initiatives we focus on in our upstream and downstream operations.  

See more in the Climate Mitigation section.

 To manage physical and transition risks, Wilmar takes a long term holistic 

approach to sustainability that is fully integrated into our business model. 

See examples in the Climate Adaptation section.

We also use the RSPO PalmGHG Version 4 Calculator 

to calculate emissions from our RSPO-certified palm oil 

operations. 

Over the last four years, net GHG emissions and emissions 

intensity has decreased significantly in our RSPO-certified 

mills. The 66% decrease in both, net GHG emissions and 

emissions intensity can be attributed to our efforts in 

reducing fertiliser use and POME.

MT CPO.

 We are currently mapping an Energy and Greenhouse Gas Reduction 

Pathway towards a low emissions future for our sugar operations.

 YKA is committed to aligning with China’s pledge to reach carbon 

neutrality before 2060.

 Goodman Fielder is committed to using 100% renewable electricity 

by 2025 and achieving net-zero GHG emissions by 2040.

 The group will establish a GHG emission baseline for all global 

operations.  Reduction target setting will be established in 2022 and

ENERGY USE IN OUR UPSTREAM OPERATIONS

Our business relies on water, energy and other resources 

to operate and are committed to the efficient use of 

resources. We acknowledge the important role that we 

play in minimising the environmental footprint of our 

operations and supporting sustainable production. We 

implement efficiency measures to reduce our energy 

and water use and, where possible, we reuse, recover 

and recycle waste. We also strive to responsibly manage 

disposed waste, effluents and chemicals.

Our environmental policy sets out our commitment to 

protecting the environment. We have also developed four 

environmental standards for our factories, palm oil mills and 

crushing plants. To monitor and improve our environmental 

performance, we have developed an Environmental 

Management System (EMS) which is consistent with the 

requirements of ISO 14001, as well as other relevant 

environmental standards. The Wilmar EMS sets out the 

Wilmar has established a number of initiatives to reduce our 

overall energy consumption; generate or utilise renewable 

energy; and drive operational efficiencies, which are part 

of our approach that also contributes towards our climate 

change strategy.

We rely mostly on renewable energy that is generated from 

biomass in our palm oil and sugar upstream operations. 

The primary energy sources for our palm oil mills are by-

products from the milling process, such as empty fruit 

bunches (EFB), kernel shells and mill fibre. For our sugar 

milling operations in Australia and India, the main source 

of fuel to power our mills is cane bagasse.

Wilmar is one of the largest producers of renewable 

biomass energy in Australia. We generate about 202 

megawatts of power during the crushing season through 

the cogeneration process. Three of our mills in Australia 

use cogeneration facilities to increase their export capacity 

and further drive efficient biomass use. At one mill, surplus 

bagasse is stockpiled on specially designed pads to ensure 

a ready source of renewable energy outside the crushing 

season. In 2020, we exported a total of 304,822 megawatt 

hours to national grids, from eight mills in Australia  and 

170,311 megawatt hours from five mills in India. This 

equates to the annual energy use of almost 25,000 homes 

for one year.*

EHS Reporting platform. More details on our Global EHS 

Reporting Platform and how it is utilised to track EHS 

performance can be found in the Employee health, safety 

and well-being Section. 

In 2020, there were no significant fines or non-monetary

Our Mumbai-based subsidiary, Shree Renuka 

Sugars Limited (SRSL), has implemented 

solar-powered irrigation pumping systems as 

an alternative power source for the farmers 

and their plantations, which reduces reliance 

on the national grid.

Farmers benefit from this initiative by having 

electricity access throughout the hot summer 

months, providing continued irrigation 

of crops as scheduled.  This has resulted 

in higher productivity yields of 25-30%, 

compared to periods when power access 

from national grids are limited.

We have progressively installed 591 pumping 

systems in open wells, bore wells and rivers 

across our farmers’ operations since 2014.

framework to ensure that we comply with all applicable 

environmental laws in countries where we operate. 

We conduct training for our employees to raise awareness 

on environmental issues and encourage them to take action 

to protect the environment. For example, Goodman Fielder 

ran an Environment Champions training and certification 

programme across our manufacturing sites in 2020.  This 

programme included modules on energy, water, waste, 

compliance and action plans. Participants also carried out 

a practical assessment at their site upon completion of 

the training. Similarly, Wilmar Sugar conducts training for 

employees and provides refresher courses on environmental 

aspects and responsibilities.

All environmental hazards, incidents and non-conformances 

that have been identified are reported and investigated 

using our Global Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) 

reporting platform. A Critical Incident Investigation Report 

is required when there is a significant incident, which then 

involves a detailed investigation into the root causes and

ENERGY USE IN OUR DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS

YKA has adopted a range of different technologies to 

reduce our energy consumption and improve energy 

efficiency. These include steam condensate recovery, waste 

heat recovery of exhaust gas and steam residual pressure 

power generation.  As these initiatives drive significant 

GHG emissions reduction, they are described in more 

detail in the Climate Change section.

Goodman Fielder has developed energy reduction targets 

for all factories within our EMS. In Australia, we invested 

over AU$ 600,000 (US$ 462,480) on a national lighting 

upgrade in 2020. We replaced over 1,500 light fittings with 

new lights that help us to reduce electricity consumption by 

50%, in comparison to the previous ones. Energy efficiency 

is tracked on a monthly basis and reported through the 

Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) network. 

Energy consumption across all of our business activities in 

2020 is 3% lower compared to 2019, despite the expansion 

of our coverage in 2020 to include operations such as 

Goodman Fielder, Global Oils and Kuching Palm Oil 

Industries. At group level, our energy intensity in 2020 

was 0.56 megawatt hours per metric ton of product, 10% 

lower compared to 2019.

Air compressor systems consume large 

proportions of the overall energy used 

within our sites. Thus, we implemented the 

Energy Consumption Management for air 

compressors to further improve energy 

savings while reducing the amount of 

compressed air potentially wasted. This has 

also allowed us to improve efficiency and 

reduce operating costs through process 

optimisation and system controls.

An example of our air compressor systems 

modification in our Yancheng site in China 

resulted in a 26% decrease in electricity 

consumption per unit of compressed air 

generated and an annual savings of more 

than RMB418,000 (close to US$64,000).

SAFEGUARDING WATER RESOURCE 

IN OUR FACTORY OPERATIONS

All Wilmar operations diligently track and monitor water 

metrics associated with usage and discharge using our 

Global EHS reporting platform. This includes the availability 

of water at the sources which we draw from to measure and 

mitigate disruptions to our operations. We also collaborate 

with local authorities to understand future water availability 

strategies.

Wilmar conducts Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) 

prior to construction of new plants or other significant 

projects, which is aligned to local environmental 

requirements. The EIA will help identify all potential relevant 

environmental risks associated with the project, including 

water risks to the natural ecosystem and local communities 

relying on the water source for their livelihoods.   

In China, some of our factories purchase steam for use, 

producing condensate which is reused for our cooling 

towers to minimise the volume of water withdrawn. At 

Dongguan Fuzhiyuan, sewage water is reclaimed and 

reused. Reverse osmosis technology is applied during 

sewage treatment with the output replacing tap water as 

cooling towers feed water supplement.

WATER USE IN OUR PALM PLANTATIONS AND MILLS

For our palm operations, Wilmar has adopted a lifecycle 

approach in the management of our water use, from the 

design to the construction and running of our mills. The 

improvement of water use efficiency helps us to deliver 

cost-saving in the long term. Wilmar has also implemented 

measures to increase water efficiency, especially for our 

most water intensive mills, as well as for nursery irrigation 

and household use.

We have been monitoring rainfall patterns at our oil palm 

plantations, resulting in records for at least 25 years in most 

of the regions where we operate. Based on these records 

and recent trends, water stress is still not a significant risk 

for our oil palm plantations. While we face reduction in 

rain during weather phenomena such as El Niño, this is 

not significant. Land irrigation using palm oil mill effluent 

(POME), which is reused as a fertiliser, continues to be 

carried out during these periods. This helps alleviate the 

impacts of the lack of rain during times of water scarcity. 

We target to reduce water usage intensity for our palm oil 

mills to 1.2 cubic metre per metric ton of FFB processed 

for Indonesia and 1.3 cubic metre per metric ton of FFB 

processed for Malaysia, Ghana and Nigeria by 2023. In 

2020, this was achieved by our palm oil mills in Central 

Kalimantan and Sumatra.

WATER USE IN OUR SUGARCANE PLANTATIONS AND MILLS

WATER-STRESSED AREAS

For our sugar operations, some of our plantations are 

rain-fed while others are irrigated farms. In accordance 

with the Bonsucro Production Standard, we monitor net 

water consumed per unit mass of product for our sugarcane 

plantations and mills. In 2020, our consumption was well 

within the water usage limits. We also attempt to ensure 

that all irrigated water is efficiently used and applied to 

our sugarcane plantations.

Wilmar has production sites in water-stressed areas in India 

and Australia. Based on the World Resources Institute’s 

Aqueduct tool, our sugar refinery in Gujarat, India operates 

in an extremely high-stress water area. All other India-

based sugar mills across Maharasthra and Karnataka and 

our Yarraville sugar refinery, in Victoria, Australia operate 

in high-stress water areas. 

In Australia, our Yarraville Refinery sources municipal 

water for refinery operations, including steam generation 

and process operations.  We also source cooling/vapour 

condensing water from the adjacent Maribyrnong River. All 

the cooling/vapour condensing water is returned back to 

the river. We have systems in place to ensure the discharge 

complies with local regulations.

In our India sugar operations, we heavily rely on the water 

contained within the cane they process. In Gujarat, we 

use surface water supplied by third-party government 

agencies. This plant is a zero-discharge facility, where 

all water withdrawn is treated and reused back in the 

operations. We have installed a secondary reverse osmosis 

plant to treat the rejected water from the primary plant to 

convert into raw water. 

We are a member of Federation of Kutch Industries 

Association (FOKIA), a government aided organisation 

to support industries in the region in mitigating water 

scarcity issues by installing common desalination plants. In 

Maharasthra and Karnataka, sugar mills that have distilleries 

and cogeneration plants in their vicinity implement a zero-

discharge approach, where the excess process condensate 

can be used for cooling towers after secondary treatment. 

The remainder discharge is mostly used for green belt 

irrigation within the sugar mills’ premises and supplied to 

neighbouring farmers.

OUR EFFLUENT TREATMENT PLANTS (ETP)

WASTEWATER FROM PALM OIL OPERATIONS

Wilmar has implemented comprehensive procedures to 

safeguard water quality. We regularly report our progress 

in monitoring and reducing significant pollutants. Priority 

substances of concern in our discharges are identified based 

on the respective country’s regulations. We adhere to all 

discharge limits specified in these regulations.

Our audit programme consists of an extensive list to check 

on the safety, SOPs and compliance-related issues specific 

to effluent treatment. In 2020, we have focused on making 

progress in our internal management of effluents. We have 

appointed a dedicated person-in-charge (PIC) in each 

region with overall responsibility for ETPs and provide a 

monthly report summarising the quality of treated effluent, 

status of projects and other updates.       

Due to COVID-19 restrictions, our technical teams were 

not able to physically audit our ETPs on site. As a result, 

we have been driving forward a Process Information 

Management System (PIMS) for technical teams to monitor 

critical ETP data online. 

Our focus in 2021 onwards is to explore wastewater 

recycling projects in Indonesia and China. We see recycling 

wastewater back to production as an important yet complex 

element to progress on our sustainability goals, due to the 

risks related to food safety. Nevertheless, we are constantly 

exploring ways in which we can reuse wastewater without 

creating food safety risks.

POME is wastewater from FFB processing; palm oil refinery 

effluent (PORE) is wastewater from the refining of crude 

palm oil (CPO). While POME is mainly organic in nature, it 

is not discharged directly, as we repurpose it through land 

application as fertiliser or treat it via anaerobic digestion 

prior to local waterway discharge. 

PORE treatment usually involves a chemical process step 

to remove the oil and grease and inorganic substances 

before further biological treatment prior to discharge. 

One palm oil refinery in Indonesia sends it effluents to a 

municipal treatment centre for external processing while 

the rest are treated in-house prior to discharge. We have 

an ongoing target to maintain effluent discharge levels 

to be within local regulation thresholds for palm oil mills 

and refineries waterway discharge. For our upstream and 

downstream sites, biological oxygen demand (BOD) and 

chemical oxygen demand (COD) levels are monitored for 

both land application and river discharge. 

Ghana’s effluent discharge standard for the Oil &amp; Processing 

sector is generalised at BOD of 50 mg/L (regardless of 

discharge destination or type of oil processing plant). We 

are currently in discussions with the local authority to set 

granular limits to differentiate the discharge standards 

between POME and PORE. In the meantime, we are 

working closely with the local regulators to ensure that 

our POME discharge quality can meet their expectations 

without being penalised. All other operations were 

compliant with relevant local thresholds in 2020.

EFFLUENTS FROM SUGAR PRODUCTION

With water forming a big part of the sugarcane crop, sugar 

mills generate effluent water through the milling process. As 

the effluent does not contain high COD, the water is suitable 

for reuse in irrigation systems after a simple treatment. 

During drought seasons, effluent water discharged from 

sugar mills is diverted to rain-fed farms to supplement any 

further water needs. For our sugar operations in Australia, 

most effluent is discharged via land application for irrigation 

purposes on farms surrounding its mills and is not governed 

by a specific discharge limit. 

In India, with our facilities operating in water-stressed areas, 

there is a focus on re-using water from the milling and 

distillery processes. Wastewater is treated and reused in 

cooling towers and to irrigate the green belts within the 

mill compounds to reduce the overall intake of water. Spent 

wash from distilleries is bio-digested and, along with other 

solid waste, reused in incineration boilers and as compost or 

liquid fertiliser. We are implementing further measures with 

an aim of achieving zero liquid discharge for our distillery 

plants in India.

There were no fines or prosecutions against Wilmar related 

to incidents of non-compliance with discharge limits in 2020.

Across all of our operations, we are committed to reducing 

the amount of waste that we generate as well as recycling 

and reusing where possible.  

Goodman Fielder’s waste management process requires 

sites to use the waste management hierarchy to minimise 

waste to landfill. Our Pampas Pastry factory was able to 

modify the production process to eliminate over 100 tonnes 

of product waste per year. In addition, the Yoplait yoghurt 

site achieved a 30% reduction in waste to landfill of 44 

tonnes in 2020, through an innovative packaging waste 

recycling partnership and increased recovery of organic 

material for stockfeed.

Wilmar follows best practice for waste management for 

our upstream palm oil facilities and seeks to recover and 

reuse all the waste that we have generated. The organic 

waste generated from our production processes includes 

EFB, mesocarp fibre and palm kernel shells. These are used 

as fuel and composted or mulched as organic fertiliser. 

Our sugar milling operations produce solid waste such as 

bagasse, press mud, ash, sludge and yeast sludge. We 

use bagasse as boiler fuel and other by-products as raw 

material for composting and soil amelioration purposes. 

Across our consumer businesses, we also work on reducing 

packaging to minimise waste generated both within and 

outside of our operations. For more information, see the 

section on Sustainable Packaging.





Across several sites in China, we have been 

using sludge drying technology to decrease 

the water content and cut the production of 

sludge in effluent treatment plant. With this 

technology, we can reduce the water content 

of sludge from 80% to 40% and the sludge 

volume by 66.7%, reducing the amount of 

solid waste generated.

TOTAL WASTE PREVENTED









Wilmar is committed to tackling food loss and food waste, which occurs 

at all stages of the value chain, and have in place various programmes and 

initiatives in relevant parts of our business.

Goodman Fielder measures food loss and waste in many parts of 

our organisation, typically as yield or unsold product disposal and 

repurposing. We also participated in national food waste baseline studies 

in Australia.  We have started work to apply the Food Loss and Waste 

(FLW) Protocol’s FLW Standard to our baking business with the aim to 

calculate a food loss and waste baseline by the end of 2021.

At our sugar refineries, we monitor refinery yield as a key measure for 

food loss. We also sell by-products from our sugar refineries such as 

excess molasses and small quantities of damaged or rejected packaged 

sugar as stockfeed.

Wilmar Sugar and Goodman Fielder also donate food products that are in 

surplus or not fit for sale but safe for human consumption, to our charity 

partner Foodbank Australia. For more information, see the Economic 

and Community Contribution section of this report.

YKA runs a National Food Security Publicity and Education campaign and 

leverages on events such as “World Food Day” to run online and offline 

activities to promote appreciation of food, including why food should be 

cherished and not wasted.

TACKLING FOOD LOSS AND FOOD WASTE

In 2020, we generated a total of 6,074,177 tonnes of 

waste, out of which 78% was diverted from disposal. A 

large proportion of our waste consists of biomass, which 

is reused to generate electricity in our upstream palm oil 

and sugar operations. We produced 313,539 tonnes of 

hazardous waste, of which 100% was disposed according 

to local legislations and licenses.

CHEMICAL USAGE

PARAQUAT

INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM)

In our agricultural operations, we use chemicals to protect 

our crops against diseases and pests and to maintain high 

yields. We aim to minimise the use of chemicals as much 

as possible, including pesticides and chemical fertilisers. 

The use of chemicals is guided by a management plan, 

with proper SOPs implemented to eliminate exposure 

to hazardous chemicals for workers, communities and 

the environment. We have implemented an Integrated 

Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, 

mechanical, biological and chemical strategies to control 

pests.

We prohibit the use of the World Health Organisation 

(WHO) Class 1A or 1B and Stockholm or Rotterdam 

Conventions pesticides in our operations and those of 

our suppliers, except for specific instances that strictly 

follow WHO recommendations and guidelines.  

For oil palm plantations, we work with our smallholder 

suppliers on appropriate use of pesticides to prevent 

overuse. This includes training on the types of pesticides 

for specific weeds and also to switch to path and circle 

spraying only—which largely reduces the overall use of 

pesticides. 

In our sugarcane plantations in Australia, we provide farmers 

with mill mud to help with fertilising. In India we have a 

programme for farmers to switch to manure or organic 

fertiliser to minimise the impact of salt pan formation due 

to high nitrogen use. 

The use of paraquat is strictly prohibited in our oil palm 

plantations, including for our suppliers.

We only allow the use of paraquat in our sugarcane 

plantations due to a lack of viable alternatives. Paraquat 

is a contact chemical and, as such, there is no residual 

activity. This helps to protect reefs in Australia compared to 

other residual chemicals that are used in the cane farming 

system. Workers are provided with adequate personal 

protective equipment (PPE) and require specific licences 

to handle these chemicals. For any substance that poses a 

potential hazard to workers or the environment, toxicity is 

closely monitored on a regular basis and risk assessments 

are carried out.

Uncontrolled rat populations pose major issues to the 

health of our oil palm trees. They damage fronds, oil 

palm flowers and fruits, significantly affecting yield. While 

rodenticides (with active ingredients such as Brodifacoum 

and Bromadiolone) in ready-mix bait form have been 

effective in controlling the rat population, they can cause 

chemical pollution to the environment, contributing to 

disturbances in the plantation area and the disruption of 

predators. Bait application and acceptance levels also 

require close supervision and monitoring. 

As an IPM solution, we have been controlling the rat 

population by breeding and releasing barn owls. With 

high reproduction rates and a high dependency on rats as 

their main source of food, barn owls are natural predators 

and serve as an optimal solution. By applying this measure, 

we have been able to minimise chemical rat bait use in 

the plantation.

In accordance with the Bonsucro Production Standard, we 

monitor the level of active ingredients per hectare for our 

sugar operations. This covers all applied agro-chemicals, 

including pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides 

and ripeners. In 2020, chemical usage at our Australia 

and Myanmar operations were within the Bonsucro limit.





As an IPM solution, we have been 

controlling the rat population by 

breeding and releasing barn owls.

Sustainable packaging

Our approach to sustainable packaging

Actions on packaging

The issue of packaging waste, particularly plastic waste, 

is of increasing concern due to the environmental impacts 

documented in recent years. However, packaging is 

necessary to maintain food safety and quality, as well 

as extend shelf life, thereby reducing food waste. This 

creates a unique challenge for our industry to tackle and 

develop solutions. Wilmar is committed to working with 

the wider industry and our R&amp;D teams to source and 

develop packaging solutions that minimise the use of 

materials and can be reused/recycled by the end-user.

IMPROVING THE MATERIALS 

USED TO INCREASE 

RECYCLABILITY

IMPROVING THE SOURCING 

REQUIREMENT OF THE MATERIALS WE 

BUY TO ENSURE THAT THEY COME 

FROM SUSTAINABLE SOURCES

In researching and developing sustainable packaging 

solutions, we want to ensure that we do not compromise 

on product safety and quality. We also need to be mindful 

of potential trade-offs as a new packaging solution might 

solve one issue but create others. For example,  Goodman 

Fielder reduced the thickness of our bread bag plastic by 

about 25%. Trials to further reduce the plastic thickness 

resulted in a significant increase in bags tearing, leading 

to more product waste. This means we have reached the 

optimal bread bag thickness when considering the impact 

of food waste versus plastic use.

At a group level, we have begun quantifying the packaging 

materials used for the 10 million tonnes of consumer 

products we produce each year. We have launched a Global 

Packaging Data Questionnaire across business units (BUs) 

to find out how many BUs have made packaging pledges. 

The findings from our questionnaire will help us to develop 

a holistic group-level packaging strategy.

Our different businesses have also been working on their 

own packaging initiatives. This is because packaging 

solutions are often driven by requirements that are specific 

to the local context and regulations, as well as the types 

of products manufactured.

For example, YKA has a number of initiatives in place. 

These include: 

• 

Working with other industry players to conduct 

research on alternative plastic bags to reduce the 

packaging volume of rice and flour products. For rice 

bags, we managed to reduce the thickness of our 

packaging from 135 millimetres to 120 millimetres and 

decreased the use of raw materials by 11%.

• 

Promoting the use of high strength, low weight 

cardboard boxes for the last two years, reducing the 

volume of raw materials required.

• 

Using calcium-plastic boxes instead of cardboard 

boxes, which are reusable up to 100 times for 

intermediate product transfers. 

• 

Jointly developing and optimising formulas with 

upstream raw material suppliers to reduce material 

consumption and improve performance, reducing 

the usage of over two million woven bags and 85,000 

plastic barrels.

• 

Introducing higher capacity options for our edible oil 

products (from 5 litres to 10 and 20 litres). For example, 

our 10-litre products use 105 grams Polyethylene 

Terephthalate (PET), saving 833 tonnes of raw materials 

used to make PET annually. 

OUR APPROACH TO IMPROVING PACKAGING IS CENTRED 

AROUND THE FOLLOWING THREE OBJECTIVES:

Similarly, Goodman Fielder’s sustainable packaging 

programme strives to deliver the required functionality while 

minimising the environmental impacts associated with the 

manufacture, transport, use and disposal of packaging. In 

2019, Goodman Fielder developed a sustainable packaging 

framework focusing on three pillars: 1) material use: using 

less material in packaging and from more sustainable 

sources; 2) intelligent design: achieving best functionality 

with the least impact and; 3) value beyond first life: to 

actively drive the circular economy for used packaging. 

Through projects delivered in Australia and New Zealand, 

Goodman Fielder has:

• 

Replaced 100 tonnes per annum of difficult-to-recycle 

PVC trays with PET.  The new trays also include 30% 

recycled content as part of our support of a circular 

economy for plastics.

• 

Reduced cardboard use by over 100 tonnes through 

the redesign of cardboard shippers used to transport 

finished products.

• 

Eliminated approximately 4,200 pallet loads per annum 

to deliver the same volume of product throughout 

Australia by focusing on pallet use optimisation. 

• 

Delivered a 185 tonnes per annum reduction in plastic 

use through a range of initiatives aimed at optimising 

the amount of material used in packaging, including: 

Goodman Fielder and Sugar Australia are part of the 

REDcycle soft plastic recycling scheme in Australia. In 

Australia, Goodman Fielder recently updated our bread 

bag artwork to encourage consumers to participate in the 

scheme by using our bread bags to collect all their soft 

plastic and return them for recycling. This campaign aims 

to address the significant gap in Australia between the 

amount of plastic packaging that is recyclable, compared 

to the amount that is actually recycled. Sugar Australia 

signed up to the scheme in 2020, with packaging featuring 

the official “recyclable” labels to be seen in 2021.

Goodman Fielder and New Zealand Sugar are part of 

the New Zealand Soft Plastic Recycling Scheme. In New 

Zealand, Goodman Fielder participates on the Steering 

Committee of the Soft Plastic Recycling Scheme.  With 

the goal of delivering a truly national product stewardship 

scheme, Goodman Fielder is providing logistics services to 

support the expansion of the scheme to the South Island 

of New Zealand.

ORGANISATION (APCO)

Goodman Fielder and Sugar Australia 

both take part in the Australian 

Packaging Covenant (APC), a 

commitment set by governments and 

industry to the sustainable design, use 

and recovery of packaging. Goodman 

Fielder has committed to achieving 

the 2025 National Packaging targets, 

while Sugar Australia is in the process 

of developing a sustainability roadmap 

to address these targets. In 2020, Sugar 

Australia also signed up to the REDcycle 

Film Stewardship Programme.

Goodman Fielder’s targets for  

2025 include: 

• 

100% of packaging to be reusable,  

recyclable or compostable

• 

50% average recycled content across  

all packaging 

•

Talent management

Our success depends on the hard work of our approximately 

100,000 strong global workforce. To continue growing and building 

a high-performing company, we are focused on attracting and 

retaining skilled individuals by creating an engaging workplace 

where everyone can reach their full potential.

Profile of our workforce

Our workplace is made up of 98% full-time employees while 2% 

are part-time employees. 

60% are employed in our plantations and the rest are based in 

our offices. Our employees are spread across 38 countries, with 

approximately 80% of them based in China, Indonesia and Malaysia. 

Temporary workers play an important role in fulfilling either seasonal 

harvest needs or specialist, timebound tasks in our upstream 

plantations. As of December 2020, 98% of our workforce benefit 

from permanent employment status, with only 2% employed as 

temporary workers.

In Indonesia, we have been striving to further increase the number of 

permanent workers. Recruitment drives in collaboration with union 

representatives help to stabilise the workforce while creating better 

efficiencies. Some of our temporary workers in Indonesia are also 

smallholders or small-scale entrepreneurs who prefer the flexibility 

offered by temporary work arrangements. It is not feasible to have 

a 100% permanent workforce in sugarcane plantations and mills 

as sugarcane is a seasonal crop. This is why we rely on temporary 

workers in our sugar operations during the main crop season. Our 

sugar business conducted a trial initiative by partnering with an 

industry which had a complementary season. However, most of the 

temporary workers in our sugar operations have their own farms 

to tend to or they have a preference to be on temporary contract 

employment, thus the initiative did not work out.

Sustainability Report 2020  |  Wilmar International Limited 

There is an ongoing global race for talent, especially in key 

emerging markets. We strive to recruit new team members 

with the skills that we currently or will soon require. 

However, we also place much emphasis on developing our 

current workforce by providing ample and relevant training 

and development opportunities. This keeps them engaged 

and up-to-date with the know-how to excel and reach their 

career aspirations. In 2020, we spent over US$ 4 million 

on training and development (approximately US$37.7 

per employee). On average, our employees attended 10 

hours of training. The higher average of training hours and 

amount spent on training for factory workers is due to the 

additional mandatory training provided to them in order 

to be able to carry out their daily work, such as basic use 

of machineries. 

Employees receive a variety of learning opportunities in the 

form of formal training, mentoring and on-the-job technical 

training. Across the board, employees have access to 

e-learning. This key tool enabled us to continue to deliver 

trainings during COVID-19. We are also looking to develop 

more e-learning courses for different employee levels.  

At management level, we have a number of development 

programmes. For example, in China, the Supervisor/Team 

Lead's Management Skills Development programme is a 

comprehensive training for employees in supervisory roles. 

It uses methods such as balance scorecards, action learning 

and coaching to help general managers and departments 

managers gain valuable skills for their role. 

We also continue to work with internal and external 

stakeholders to establish Wilmar as the employer of choice 

in the industry.

Training and development

Compensation and benefits

We offer competitive compensation packages with 

additional benefits. All employees, regardless of their 

employment status, receive life insurance and disability 

and invalidity coverage. Permanent employees, whether 

full-time or part-time also receive health care and parental 

leave. Retirement provisions are also offered to permanent 

and full-time employees.

Recruiting talent

Attracting and recruiting the right talent remains a priority, 

as our company continues to grow and evolve. The six 

qualities that we look for in our employees globally 

reflect Wilmar’s core values. We aim to attract and retain 

employees who are capable, honest and hard-working. We 

hire people who are hands-on and believe in our vision of 

bringing affordable nutritious food to the world. We look 

for people who go the extra mile, have an international 

outlook and enjoy giving back to the community. Our 

recruitment efforts also aim to build an organisation that 

brings experiences and backgrounds as diverse as the 

customer base we serve. See the section on Diversity and 

Inclusion for more information.

We have established a number of training academies to 

fortify our efforts in identifying and nurturing talent. For 

example, our subsidiary Yihai Kerry Arawana (YKA) in China 

launched the “Academy of Success” or 新·星未来大学生

培养项目 in 2019, where high-potential new graduates 

undergo a 42-month structured training programme 

designed to groom future leaders. The training focuses on 

developing the professional and management capabilities 

and covers 59 factories, 29 subsidiaries and 6 units of YKA.

Attracting and 

recruiting the 

right talent 

remains a 

priority, as 

our company 

continues 

to grow and 

evolve.

We firmly believe in recognising internal opportunities for 

our people to grow. Managers leverage our global platform 

to retain people and support career aspirations by offering 

international positions. In 2020, 17% of our open positions 

were filled by internal candidates. Senior leadership and 

human resources stay close to succession planning for key 

positions, evaluating bench strength and future potential. 

In addition, employees receive a formal performance 

review, which allows development opportunities and 

relevant training to be identified, in line with the individual’s 

areas of responsibility and career aspirations. As of 2020, 

88% of our total workforce receive performance and career 

development reviews, an even split between male and 

female employees.

Respective countries conduct an employee engagement 

survey regularly to capture our employees’ feedback 

about working at Wilmar, as well as levels of employee 

engagement. In 2020, the survey covered approximately 

20% of the workforce, of which 99% responded that they are 

"actively engaged", "engaged" or "somewhat engaged". 

We will continue to encourage employees to participate 

and share their feedback with us.

"After 21 years at Goodman Fiedler, it is 

a good time for personal and professional 

reflection. Three kids, three houses and 12 

roles later, time flies when you're having fun” 

says Alan. For Alan, Goodman Fielder has 

been at the centre of his amazing journey. 

For him, Goodman Fielder is truly a national 

business and it has given him many wonderful 

career experiences and opportunities to 

connect with great people.

For Alan, being able to help support 

and improve such a large and complex 

organisation and to see so many individuals 

achieve their career aspirations and 

financials goals is what continues to give him 

enormous satisfaction. He noted that career 

opportunities exist across many different 

functions and within a range of market 

leading categories. With the right level of 

ambition and initiative, one can really make a 

difference here. For Alan, “Goodman Fielder 

is known for having highly capable and 

committed people and when you peel back 

the many layers of the organisation what also 

stands out, is the level of empowerment and 

support given to great and talented people 

and the satisfaction that comes from that."

Human rights and 

labour standards

Human Rights offer universal recognition of the inherent 

dignity of every individual, making them one of the 

key principles we uphold.  As a multinational company 

operating across borders, employing people from different 

nationalities and interacting with a huge range of cultures, 

Wilmar takes our responsibility to protecting human rights 

very seriously.

We are committed to respecting human rights, as defined 

in the United Nations (UN) Declaration of Human Rights and 

ILO Core Conventions on Labour. Our objective is to ensure 

that this applies to all parties or individuals throughout our 

value chain. Wilmar is also a signatory of the UN Global 

Compact. We are also committed to implementing the 

UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

Wilmar’s human rights framework

Our Human Rights Framework, launched in 2019, was 

developed in reference to the Organisation for Economic 

Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines. It 

brings together all Wilmar policies relevant to human 

rights. The framework provides detailed instructions on the 

practical implementation of all principles. These include 

due diligence mechanisms for identifying, preventing, 

mitigating and accounting for our impacts on human rights, 

including remediating any adverse impacts.















Li Zhuoling joined Yihai Kerry Lanzhou Oils 

&amp; Grains in July 2020 as Human Resource 

Executive, Learning and Development, 

through campus recruitment after her 

graduation. She decided to move to Xingping 

soon after due to personal reasons. After a 

comprehensive assessment on her individual 

competencies, the Group transferred her to 

Xingping Foodstuffs Human Resources (HR) 

team to lead on our training and corporate 

culture initiatives.

Being in a new team and location, Zhuoling 

had some initial concerns. Xingping’s HR 

and Administration team however provided 

additional support for her transfer and 

to help her settle in her new role. With 

job rotations, Zhuoling and seven other 

trainees went to various plants to learn 

more about each production line. Through 

lectures, practical exercises and seminars 

led by the plant head, as well as guidance 

from outstanding mentors, she developed 

a broader mindset where she is able to 

develop new ideas and ways of working and 

deliver on projects with greater confidence. 

Three months later, Zhuoling was already 

responsible for multiple projects such 

as leading team building and graduate 

programmes. She is ready to settle down and 

work hard in training and corporate culture. 

She firmly believes “the harder you work, the 

luckier you are and the more you learn, the 

wiser you are!”

Wu Bingning, a fresh graduate, chose 

Yihai Kerry (Wenzhou) Oils and Grains 

Foodstuffs to kickstart her career as 

Quality Control Technician. The company 

developed a comprehensive training 

plan for her, exposing her to technology, 

equipment and management methods in the 

commercialisation and production of flour. 

Following the completion of the orientation 

programme and courses from the “Academy 

of Success”, she was able to accelerate 

her transition from student to a working 

professional very rapidly. At the same time, 

the company provided her an outstanding 

career coach and mentor to guide her 

throughout her daily work. The leaders of 

the Wenzhou plant also organise regular one-

on-one exchanges with her to help her grow 

professionally. Since joining, Wu Bingning is 

able to independently complete the tasks 

assigned to her by her superiors.

Our Human Rights Policy sets out our commitment to 

respecting human rights across all Wilmar subsidiaries and 

associates, including suppliers and contractors. It focuses 

on the rights we have identified as the most pertinent, 

broadly classified into two areas: 1) Labour rights and; 

2) Indigenous and Local Community Rights. Our Human 

Rights Policy also outlines the internationally-recognised 

standards and internal policies that guide our approach. 

Wilmar’s No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation 

(NDPE) Policy complements our Human Rights Policy by 

ensuring that the rights of people and communities are 

respected across our palm oil operations.

Central to our approach on human rights are our Grievance 

Procedure and Whistleblowing Policy. They both enable 

stakeholders to provide information, raise grievances or 

flag concerns through formal channels, anonymously and 

without the fear of reprisal. Any issues raised against Wilmar 

or our suppliers through either channel will be thoroughly 

investigated. We ensure that appropriate remedial actions 

are put in place for all confirmed grievance and complaints. 

In 2020, we published our No Exploitation Protocol for 

third-party suppliers, a dedicated protocol that supports 

our Grievance Procedure in addressing breaches related 

to the 'no exploitation' component of our NDPE policy.

To implement our commitments on human rights, we actively 

participate in partnerships and various multi-stakeholder 

platforms that promote and support the protection of 

human rights. This includes consulting with human rights 

experts and CSOs to ensure we keep abreast of the latest 

developments and seek feedback on our approach and 

progress.

We also work hard to cascade human rights issues via 

capacity building to our suppliers, as well as developing 

supporting tools and guidelines to assist our suppliers in 

better understanding and implementing human rights.  

Respecting labour rights

We commit to respecting the labour rights of all workers 

according to local, national and ratified international laws. 

We also commit to ensuring international best practices 

where legal frameworks are not yet in place. We use as 

reference the United Kingdom (UK) Modern Slavery Act, the 

Free and Fair Labor in Palm Oil Production: Principles and 

Implementation Guidance, as well as other Wilmar policies. 

For our palm oil operations in Indonesia, we have been 

collaborating with our technical partner and expert, 

Verité – an independent non-profit organisation working 

to strengthen labour rights in supply chains. Since 2017, 

we have been exploring systemic labour and human 

rights risks that can occur in plantations, specifically in 

the Indonesian context. Areas we have looked into include, 

but are not limited to: understanding the possible root 

causes of child labour; the link between work and pay 

practices; and emerging labour issues. Through initial 

12-month programmes at PT. Daya Labuhan Indah and PT. 

Perkebunan Milano in North Sumatra, Verité conducted an 

assessment on the ground with the aim of building internal 

processes and competencies, and developing sustainable 

solutions to recurring labour rights issues. Following the 

initial assessment, we implemented a three-year strategy 

to enhance our systems, progress of which was reviewed 

in mid-2020. We aimed to launch the same programme 

throughout our Indonesian operations in the second half 

of 2020, which has unfortunately been delayed due to 

COVID-19. 

As an indication of our progress, Wilmar ranked 10th 

out of 43 of food and beverage companies in the 2020 

KnowTheChain report. The independent report evaluates 

and scores 43 of the world’s largest food and beverage

PAYING DECENT WAGES

All Wilmar employees across the Group are paid at or 

above the legal minimum wages of their respective regions 

or countries. 

Wilmar is committed to assessing and ensuring that our 

employees, contractors and suppliers are paid a living 

wage. We base our calculations on available living wage 

frameworks for countries we operate in, including the Global 

Living Wage Coalition, Wage Indicator Foundation, MIT 

Living Wage Calculator and RSPO Living Wage Benchmark. 

To date, we have assessed 100% of our employees and 

contractors to ensure that they are paid a living wage. We 

also provide free housing, facilities and benefits for those 

who choose to stay on site at our oil palm plantations 

operating in remote areas.

We target to assess all of our suppliers to ensure that they 

are paying their workers a living wage using our Supplier 

Reporting Tool (SRT) by 2021. For more details on SRT, 

please see the section on Transforming our Supply Chain.

companies based on policies and practices to address 

forced labour and human trafficking risks within supply 

chains. We also ranked first in the agriculture sector and 

third across all industries in East Asia and Pacific in the 2020 

Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB). A total of 

57 of the world's largest agriculture products companies 

were assessed in the agriculture category.

This is a testament to our progress in upholding and 

protecting the rights of people and increasing transparency 

through better reporting. 







Wilmar has been an active member of the RSPO Labour 

Task Force and has been a key contributor to the RSPO 

Guidance for Implementing a Decent Living Wage 

(DLW) – a much anticipated guidance document for the 

oil palm industry regarding the payment of a DLW for 

workers and their families to enjoy a decent standard 

of living. This approach takes into account family needs 

such as adequate housing, sanitation facilities, a clean 

water supply, medical care and children’s educational 

requirements. As the RSPO Guidance on DLW provides 

benchmarks for Malaysia, Ghana and three provinces 

in Indonesia – Sumatra, East Kalimantan and West 

Kalimantan – we are in the process of calculating 

potential DLW in other regions where we operate. 

General Manager of Group Sustainability at Wilmar, 

Ms Perpetua George, also joined the Decent Living 

Wage Task Force (DLW TF), which was formalised in 

January 2021. The DLW TF was formed to oversee the 

development of the RSPO DLW benchmarks globally.

PREVENTING FORCED, TRAFFICKED AND BONDED LABOUR 

Wilmar prohibits any form of forced, trafficked or bonded 

labour within our operations or supply chain. Wages, 

identification documents and personal belongings are not 

withheld from employees and workers, unless with their 

consent. Secure lockers are provided for workers to store 

their personal belongings. 

In our Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil operations, Wilmar 

carries out direct recruitment of workers and directly pays 

for all recruitment fees. Where we use recruitment agencies, 

we do so to support our documentation processes. This 

eliminates risks of forced or bonded labour which can 

happen via coercion or contract misrepresentation, or 

through the collection of recruitment fees from workers. 

In Nigeria and Ghana, we limit the use of any contracted 

agent to logistical and administrative purposes only. To 

prevent any risk of exploitation, all salaries and remuneration 

are transacted directly between Wilmar and the workers.

Our UK Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement can 

be found on our website.

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING 

Wilmar respects the right of employees to collective 

bargaining and the right to form and join trade unions of 

their choice. In the absence of a proper collective agreement 

or association, workers are free to join any other unions. 

As of December 2020, 97% of our eligible employees 

worldwide are covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Situations and legislations vary from country to country. For 

example, in Nigeria, all permanent staff and management 

are eligible for union membership. However, in Ghana, 

managerial staff are precluded from union membership 

to prevent conflict of interest.

In the states of Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysia, where there 

is no formal workers union present, we have established 

social and welfare committees in all our plantations for 

workers to raise and address topics or concerns related 

to their working or living environment. 

In Australia, all waged employees are covered by an 

industrial agreement (Award or Enterprise Agreement), 

while the remaining staff and managerial employees are 

covered through stand-alone contracts. There is one major 

union association present in Myanmar.



PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF CHILDREN

Wilmar does not tolerate child labour, any form of child 

exploitation or child abuse. While risks of child labour 

are higher in our upstream palm plantations operations, 

we are committed to protecting and safeguarding the 

rights of children throughout our operations. In 2017, 

Wilmar published our Child Protection Policy, outlining 

our commitment to respecting and protecting the rights 

of children.  We have placed significant emphasis on 

providing children with access to education as one of the 

main interventions to protect the rights of children and 

preventing child labour. 

We have built schools and crèches at all of our oil palm 

plantations for the children of our employees to attend. 

In Indonesia, these facilities are also open to children 

from our local communities. In addition to building school 

facilities, we also provide free transportation to schools 

and subsidies for school fees and uniforms. In 2020, we 

supported 10,840 children of school-going age in their 

education. This means that around 92.2%# of children at 

our plantations attended school in 2020. This is monitored 

by a census at each plantation. 

We also operate 145 crèches across our plantations in 

Indonesia, Malaysia and Ghana. As of December 2020, these 

crèches tend to 3,366 children of Wilmar employees. In 

Ghana a further 18 children from surrounding communities 

attend Wilmar crèches. 













In Indonesia, our strong working relationship 

with labour unions helps to ensure continuous 

improvements for our workers’ quality of life. 

Unions play an important role in improving 

worker-management engagement and to 

ensure healthy industrial relations. We also 

recognise that unions serve as effective 

mechanisms for raising grievances, as well to 

provide input on how to solve issues relevant 

to workers.  

For example, in Indonesia, we work closely 

with the unions Serbundo and HUKATAN-

Konfederasi Serikat Buruh Sejahtera 

Indonesia (KSBSI) when updating or renewing 

Perjanjian Kerja Bersama (PKB) or collective 

bargaining agreements (CBA). Typically, 

a CBA is specific to a single workplace or 

company site. Working with KSBSI, we also 

jointly negotiated and developed a multisite 

CBA for our West Kalimantan operations.

Every year, our trade unions in China receive 

proposals from employees and there is a 

meeting with employee representatives. With 

the concerted efforts of union members, 

employee representatives and company 

management, employees’ proposals are 

reviewed. When approved, the proposal 

will be adopted in a timely manner and the 

handling process will be made public. In 

cases where the proposal is not approved, 

we will engage our employees to discuss the 

reasons or address concerns.

SUPPORTING CHILDREN’S RIGHT TO EDUCATION DURING COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic saw the closure of schools 

across the globe, with lessons moving online. However, 

for children in oil palm plantations, maintaining access to 

education during these times was a unique challenge: 

• 

Stable and reliable internet connectivity is limited in 

many of the remote locations where our plantations 

are located.

• 

There is a lack of computers in households, with 

children having access to desktops mostly in schools. 

• 

The cost of mobile internet data can be unaffordable 

for video streaming or virtual classrooms. 

To mitigate the impact of school closures on children who 

live in our plantations in Indonesia, Ghana, Malaysia and 

Nigeria, we worked collectively with our partners, schools, 

teachers and parents to develop out-of-the-box solutions. 

Malaysia: In our Sabah and Sarawak operations, the 

majority of our workers are from Indonesia and their 

children attend what are effectively private schools. We 

run primary schools jointly with NGO Humana Child Aid 

Society and run the junior secondary schools jointly with 

the Indonesian consulate, the Community Learning Centre 

(CLC). In addition to the challenges mentioned above, 

border closures, with many of our Indonesian teachers 

unable to return to their schools immediately, added 

another level of complexity. 

CLC teachers and children adapted to a workable 

online lesson plan by relying on basic apps accessed by 

smartphones. This approach has worked well, but relied 

on teachers being on-site to check on the children’s work. 

With movement restrictions eventually easing, teachers 

could do walk-abouts to check in on the children. 

For the Humana primary schools, Wilmar has assisted with 

the printing of school materials and worksheets. Where 

necessary, we have designed an “internal homework 

postal system” where the plantation office or members 

of the WoW would deliver worksheets to the children in 

turns. The worksheets are then collected and handed over 

to the teachers for checking.

Ghana: We held radio broadcasts of educational 

programmes to supplement the official televised 

government school programmes. Where possible,  

we enabled access to televisions for official  

educational programmes.

Indonesia: Some of the schools were able to offer online 

lessons and we supported this through making laptops 

available where possible. We also enabled access to 

televisions where educational programmes could be 

broadcasted.

Overall, there was also a heavy reliance on social media 

and group chat functions such as WhatsApp, as a less 

data-heavy way to conduct lessons. Group chats were also 

used as a means to connect with parents on school work 

and lessons.

38 schools in 16 provinces, municipalities and autonomous 

regions across the country. There are currently more than 

16,000 students studying and more than 1,200 teachers 

working at the schools. For more information on the 

Yihai Kerry Education Aid Programme, see the section on 

Economic and Community Contribution.

In Australia, we have developed a series of child safety 

education programmes in schools and kindergartens known 

as the ‘Cane Train’. This programme is aimed at educating 

children who live or attend school around sugar mills and 

distilleries. It outlines what sugar production looks like and 

how to stay safe in the surroundings.

In recognition of our efforts in protecting and strengthening 

children’s rights, Wilmar was recognised as an industry 

leader in the Global Child Forum (GCF) Southeast Asia 

2020 benchmark – scoring 9.4 out of 10 to emerge as the 

top performing company across all industries in Southeast 

Asia. We earned a similar similar recognition in 2019 by 

GCF, who also assessed Wilmar to be among the top global 

leaders in their 2019 global benchmark study.

Child safety is a significant issue in our upstream palm 

operations because our workers’ housing estates, 

where children live with their parents, are located 

within our plantation. This community includes schools, 

crèches, clinics and other facilities where children could 

be present. Since 2018, we have conducted annual 

child safety assessments covering our upstream palm 

operations. Starting off in Indonesia and Malaysia in  

2020, we expanded this annual assessment to our 

operations in Africa.

 

Carried out internally by a team independent of the 

plantation operation reporting structure, the aim is to 

understand the issues being reported that relate to the 

safety of children; to identify any reoccurring issues; and 

to record programmes or interventions being put in place 

to improve overall child safety. 

In 2020, we identified and reported on additional 

measures linked to the COVID-19 pandemic aimed

at creating a safer environment for children; raising 

awareness among caretakers and children; and 

protecting the health of children and families living in 

our plantations. Last year, based on close collaboration 

with our plantation Womens’ Working Groups (WoW), 

we also studied health records in the plantation clinics to 

understand and identify any potential blind spots related 

to the health of mothers, infants and children.







In collaboration with Earthworm Foundation 

(EF), Archer Daniel Midland Company (ADM), 

Avon and Nestlé, we have also developed 

a directory of social services to guide the 

private sector in improving the health, safety 

and education of children living on or near 

plantations for Malaysia. The Children in 

Plantation (CiP) Directory – available 

in English and Bahasa Malaysia – is the 

first publication of its kind in the country. 

It contains four priority areas: education, 

community engagement, birth registration 

and other child protection related services 

for children and youth living in the rural  

areas of Sabah.

In collaboration with Business for Social 

Responsibility (BSR) and consumer companies 

including Nestlé, Colgate-Palmolive, PepsiCo, 

Neste and Procter &amp; Gamble, we developed 

a Child Protection and Safeguarding 

Implementation Manual. 

Alongside a series of capacity-building 

workshops, this manual enables suppliers to 

learn, discuss and adopt pragmatic measures 

to strengthen the rights and protection 

for children. Since our first workshop 

in November 2019 in Jakarta, we have 

conducted three additional physical and one 

online workshop to gather feedback and 

finalise the manual.  

To date, approximately 190 participants 

from supplier companies, government 

representatives, trade unions and CSOs 

attended the workshops. As part of the 

programme. The next phase will be a pilot 

for further refinement of the manual, with an 

intention to adapt the manual to allow for 

more generic applicability outside of Wilmar’s 

supplier base. This will include partnering 

with other oil palm companies  

in the field testing and development of 

versions for other palm producing  

countries, like Malaysia.

Respecting indigenous and local 

community rights

We are committed to respecting and upholding the legal 

and customary land tenure rights of communities, and the 

individual rights of indigenous and local communities. This 

commitment also extends to our suppliers as communicated 

in our No Exploitation Protocol. Prior to any new planting, 

Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) must be granted 

to ensure local communities have clear and specific 

avenues to negotiate the conditions of any project. This 

is in accordance with the United Nations Declaration on 

the Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRIP) and the High 

Carbon Stock Approach (HCSA) toolkit.

In land-related planning, participatory mapping is carried 

out to involve the communities, governments and where 

appropriate, supporting NGOs. If a dispute or conflict 

arises, we will follow the steps stipulated in our Grievance 

Procedure, in a timely and transparent manner.  Where 

we have caused or contributed to negative human rights 

impacts, steps to remediate will be taken.

Where feasible, we also seek to support food security for 

local communities by assisting with establishment of other 

crops and food production business.

Diversity 

and inclusion

With a diverse global workforce, we benefit from new and 

unique perspectives that help us to serve our wide range 

of customers and consumers. At Wilmar, we are committed 

to fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment that 

empowers everyone to be their individual and unique 

selves. Recognising that women play an important part 

in our workforce, we are also working towards creating 

a fairer and more inclusive workplace for them. Diversity 

is our strength.

Every Country Head and Business Head is accountable for 

supporting and encouraging diverse and inclusive practices 

at Wilmar. We have a number of policies supporting our 

approach. Our Equal Opportunity Policy sets out our 

commitment to ensuring all employees have the right to 

equal opportunities and treatment, regardless of ethnic 

origin, gender, national origin, age, social class, religion, 

sexual orientation, gender identity, union membership, 

political affiliation or disability. This commitment applies to 

all of our HR processes, including recruitment, promotions, 

training and development, and retirement. Our Board 

Diversity Policy ensures that Directors are selected from a 

wide range of backgrounds with diverse skills, qualifications 

and relevant experience. 

Although operating in traditionally male dominated 

industries, we are progressively working towards improving 

female representation at all levels of our workforce. In 

2020, 23% of our total employee headcount was female. 

Women also make up 20% of all management positions.  

Regardless of gender, all employees and workers are paid 

equally based on their role and experience.

Since September 2018, Earthworm 

Foundation (EF) has been supporting Wilmar 

and local communities in the Pasaman Barat 

district of West Sumatra, Indonesia, to reach 

a resolution over land tenure disputes. These 

issues relate back to a land acquisition in 

the 1990s and reflect the complex land use 

and ownership rights in Indonesia, as well as 

underlying factors influencing the many land 

conflicts active in this region.

In March 2020, Wilmar subsidiary PT 

Permata Hijau Pasaman Unit 2 (PHP 2) 

and the Maligi community successfully 

reached an agreement, concluding a long-

standing conflict. EF released a public 

report detailing the resolution process 

and the outcome.This resolution of conflict 

was reached by establishing mutual trust 

and conducive conditions for open and 

constructive discussions. Mutual trust was 

achieved through transparent practices, 

including intense consultation, dialogue and 

negotiation with local people following the 

FPIC process. 

Through this process, EF was also able 

to provide us with recommendations on 

strengthening our internal systems for 

stakeholders to raise and for Wilmar to 

resolve grievances related to social conflicts.  

In particular, one important lesson we took 

away was the need to engage directly with 

the community on the ground to understand 

first-hand what their concerns and needs 

are. The success of this intense negotiation 

provides a blueprint for Wilmar to overcome 

such cases in other subsidiaries in line with 

our NDPE commitments.

At BOPP, we have been allocating areas 

of land to our workers, especially along 

roadsides, for them to grow vegetable crops. 

Most farmers grow mixed crops including 

maize, cassava, plantains, cocoyam and  

other vegetables.

While farmers practise mostly organic 

farming, BOPP plays a supervisory role 

to ensure the safe and responsible use of 

agrochemical and other safety protocols  

are followed.

This programme has helped to increase food 

security for most of our workers, which in 

turn has increased their productivity on our 

plantations. Through this initiative, workers 

are able to grow a variety of crops close to 

their house, contributing to a healthier and 

more balanced lifestyle for themselves and 

their families.

In 2019, Wilmar launched our Women’s Charter which 

outlines our commitment to respecting women’s rights 

and ensuring their welfare. A number of other policies, 

including our Sexual Harassment, Violence and Abuse, 

and Reproductive Rights Policy supports our Women’s 

Charter. This Charter takes account of the fact that Wilmar 

employs people to work in diverse environments, including 

plantations, factories and offices. The Charter applies to our 

operations globally and is implemented through various 

initiatives that are suitable to specific local environments. 

We began establishing women’s committees in our palm 

oil plantations in 2007, regardless of RSPO certification 

status. As of 2020, we have established Women’s Working 

Groups (WoW) or Gender Committee in 100% of our oil 

palm plantations in Ghana, Indonesia, Malaysia and Nigeria.

Wilmar’s Women’s Charter is implemented in our upstream 

oil palm plantations through the local WoW, who report 

directly to the plantation or mill management.

Prior to that, we formed the Women’s Committee Steering 

Group (WCSG) in April 2019 to ensure that there is 

consistency and alignment with the five key issue objectives: 

1. 

Protection and care of female health 

2. 

Care of family life and welfare

3. 

Protection from sexual harassment and violence

4. 

Non-discriminatory, fair and equal opportunities at 

work and in worker representation

5. 

Continuous education for personal and family  

life improvement

In 2020, there were zero incidents of harassment or 

discrimination across our Group.

In Australia, Wilmar is part of Diversity Council 

Australia Limited, an independent organisation 

spearheading equitable diversity and inclusion 

in the workplace, with a goal of developing or 

supporting initiatives to establish a diverse and 

accommodating workplace for all employees. 

Recognising that sugar mills are important 

employers in the region, Wilmar also began an 

apprenticeship programme for young women 

in Queensland. We were not able to proceed 

with this in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions. 

We hope to continue this programme in 2021.

"While women in 

agriculture largely 

fill roles that are 

supporting in nature, 

women are also 

increasingly taking 

on leadership roles." 

Through the efforts of our WoW, we have launched a 

number of initiatives aimed at improving the health 

and well-being of women at our oil palm plantations, 

especially maternal health. We also support healthy 

and safe childcare. 

We organise and conduct trainings, group sessions 

and meetings to raise awareness on reproductive 

rights and birth control options; the importance of 

regular screenings for breast and cervical cancer; 

nutrition; awareness on child diseases, like hand foot 

mouth disease; and the importance of childhood 

vaccinations. In conjunction with local hospitals and 

local health authorities, we also carry out health-

related campaigns, for example on the importance 

of the polio vaccination. We also facilitate equal 

access to health services. 

Crèches are an important part of our work towards 

enhancing women’s welfare as they provide a safe 

place for children to be looked after while they 

go to work. To improve the safety of our crèches, 

we introduced creche registration and attendance 

records for children. The crèche records provide 

general information on the child, such as attendance 

and vaccination history, which our crèches will use to 

ensure children receive all mandatory immunisation. 

Together with the maternal health cards that track 

women’s pre-natal and ante-natal health, this 

provides a good indicator to understand the health 

status of families. 

In 2019 and 2020, we focussed our efforts  

towards improving the reporting and handling  

of cases related to sexual harassment in our 

plantation operations.

WoWs and Gender Committees were initially set up 

as channels to receive and investigate any sexual 

harassment-related cases. However, it became 

apparent upon further review that there were also 

a number of reported cases that did not constitute 

sexual harassment. This was overwhelming and 

burdening the WoW teams, who took responsibility 

to investigate all reported cases. Examples of such 

cases include incidents where parents object to their 

adult children’s consensual relationships or spouses 

raising cases of extra-marital affairs.

To address this, capacity building to explain what 

constitutes sexual harassment was carried out 

amongst the WoW members as well as to workers 

in the plantations. This provided more clarity to 

the WoW teams and helped to strengthen the 

understanding of sexual harassment, ensuring that 

resources were not inadvertently taken away from 

actual cases.      

We also identified the need to have better “after-

care” support for victims of sexual harassment 

once the cases are closed out. Skills and training for 

counselling were identified as particularly important 

for the WoW teams. In 2021, we will be working 

with women’s rights specialist organisations to 

strengthen our sexual harassment reporting and 

handling procedures, including improving “after-

care” support for victims of sexual harassment. 

Beginning with all WoW in our Malaysian operations, 

we will be working with Women Aid’s Organisation 

(WAO), a Malaysian-based CSO that promotes 

women's rights, specifically on addressing violence 

against women. WAO will provide training to 

members of WoW on gender-based violence.

“Upon joining Wilmar, I was posted to our Sapi oil 

palm plantation in Sabah where I was pleasantly 

surprised to discover that there were plenty 

of women who helped form the backbone of 

operations in a male-majority environment. 

I have witnessed women operating heavy 

machinery and tractors expertly and women in 

both managerial and engineering roles in the mills 

and refineries. We also have women trudging and 

powering through rough and at times dangerous, 

jungle tracks to carry out conservation-related 

activities. We even have women who are card-

carrying Wildlife Wardens in Sabah, authorised 

to not only arrest those suspected of wildlife 

trafficking, but to also stop any type of vehicle, 

including aeroplanes from taking off! The reality is 

that the agriculture sector is still very much male-

dominated. However, what I have experienced 

is that there is a growing recognition of the 





importance of women working in this industry. 

While women in agriculture largely fill roles that are 

supporting in nature, women are also increasingly 

taking on leadership roles.

The one common thread among the women I 

have spoken to is, how facing and overcoming 

challenges is a key requirement for women to be 

successful in the workplace. On top of working 

hard and being enthusiastic about new challenges, 

this is what sticks to my mind: We need to 

recognise our value and contributions towards 

the organisation we work for and this requires us 

to first acknowledge the specific challenges that 

women face.

Doors are being opened for girls and women every 

day and we must work to ensure we can help keep 

those doors open for future women to also achieve 

their dreams.”

“At 24, I made the decision to move from India to join 

Wilmar as a management trainee in the sustainability team, 

which had me nervous yet ecstatic. I had the opportunity 

of experiencing many firsts - discovering a new role while 

navigating a new culture, as well as working with and getting 

to know new people in a completely new country - a chance 

to make memories that would last a lifetime.   

Over the past eight years, I have had multiple 

opportunities to work with people across various 

geographies, foster relationships and forge partnerships 

that have moulded me into the person I am today. Each 

experience has been stimulating, satisfying, challenging and 

refreshing in its own right. 

From the curious young woman who started out, to today, a 

confident young mother, Wilmar has played a pivotal role in 

my life; not just in nurturing my professional career but also 

providing a stable foundation that allows me to balance my 

personal life. I believe that everyone at Wilmar is not only 

presented with equal opportunities but also backed by a 

management par excellence and I am truly grateful for it all.

As Confucius rightly said, ‘Choose a job you love  and you 

will never have to work a day in your life.’”

HEARING FROM SOME OF OUR FEMALE EMPLOYEES

“I joined Yihai Kerry Zhoukou Oils and Grains in 2018 and 

was responsible for operations and planning work. In 2020, 

I was recommended bed rest during my pregnancy due 

to health conditions. At the same time, I was concerned 

that my work would be affected and that I did not have 

enough days of leave. After learning about my condition, the 

company assured me that my work could be shared among 

my colleagues and that they did not expect me to work from 

home as work-stress could affect my rest and the pregnancy. I 

was able to take three months of medical leave to focus on my 

health, with the company being very supportive and checking 

in on me regularly. I am very grateful for the company’s 

concern and support and being able to go back to work once 

my health condition stabilised.”

We had our son Aidan in April 2019 and I returned from 

maternity leave to work part-time in March 2020. In my first 

week back at work, Goodman Fielder commenced working 

from home due to COVID-19 restrictions. As a New Zealander 

living in Australia and with ongoing border closures, my 

husband and I decided it was time to return home to New 

Zealand. My leader supported me to continue in my role 

working in a remote capacity. I feel so lucky to be living our 

ideal lifestyle close to family, whilst also continuing my career.”

Alida De Fluiter

SENIOR HUMAN RESOURCE BUSINESS PARTNER 

MANAGER - SUSTAINABILITY &amp; SUPPLY CHAIN

“I officially joined Wilmar International on 1 January 2015 as 

the Assistant General Manager (GM) of Group Sustainability. 

I was already coming into my second month of pregnancy 

and was a bit concerned as this would mean I would be giving 

birth relatively soon after joining. 

Once I reached the end of my first trimester and was secure 

in the pregnancy, I informed my immediate superiors (Simon 

Siburat, who was at the time, the GM of Group Sustainability 

and Jeremy Goon, our Chief Sustainability Officer) – and was 

immediately reassured that there was no issue with my taking 

maternity leave (60-days statutory paid leave in Malaysia) and 

that my job was not going anywhere!

I was still breast feeding when I came back to work after 

maternity leave and as I travelled around our company in 

Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and elsewhere – I found so 

much support in being provided with nominated space to 

accommodate my ongoing lactation, as well as refrigeration 

and freezer storage for my breast milk. While in Wilmar 

premises, I never had to have the indignity or demoralisation 

of having to be forced to pump in a toilet – though this did 

happen once, ironically in a fancy hotel in Singapore where I 

was attending an external meeting. 

With support from work – I successfully breast fed up until my 

son self-weaned around his first birthday.”

Employee health, 

safety and well-being

Inculcating a culture of safety across our entire business 

is an ongoing priority for Wilmar. We strive to ensure the 

health, safety and general well-being of our employees, 

workers and all those involved in Wilmar’s operations. 

Not only is this a fundamental right, but it also ensures 

we have a healthy, motivated and productive workforce. 

With our workers undertaking a wide range of different 

tasks - such as harvesting, operating heavy machineries 

and transporting goods - any lapse in health or safety 

protocols either directly or indirectly impacts our people 

as well as our operations.

Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) 

management system

Health and safety hazard identification 

and risk assessments

Health and safety training 

Promoting worker health

We developed and implemented the Wilmar Integrated 

Management System (WIMS) - an integrated EHS 

management system that follows internationally recognised 

standards, including ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018 

- in order to effectively minimise workplace health and 

safety risks linked with our activities. WIMS covers the 

entire Wilmar group and all of our employees, despite EHS 

management systems only being mandatory in selected 

countries. WIMS allows us to implement an overarching 

global system that ensures a common and consistent 

approach to EHS management. We established EHS 

Committees at country or site level as a forum for open 

communication between employees and management 

to address EHS issues affecting Wilmar’s workforce. We 

constantly review WIMS in an effort to improve our health 

and safety performance.

We also developed the Wilmar Process Safety Management 

Policy and a 14-element Process Safety Management 

Standards based on the Occupational Safety and  

Health Administration (OSHA), to further reduce the 

risk and severity of EHS hazards. The standards cover 

process hazard analysis, high risk work, contractor safety, 

management of change and investigation of incidents. 

Our Process Safety Management Standard has been  

rolled out to all oleochemical production facilities and 

hazardous operations. 

Risk assessments, which are aligned with national and 

ISO standards, are carried out by trained personnel. They 

identify work-related hazards and appropriate measures 

to eliminate or minimise them. The results are used to 

continuously enhance the WIMS, our risk controls, Standard 

Operating Procedures (SOPs) and to identify relevant 

training needs. Wilmar has developed a systematic and 

documented process to identify EHS hazards and evaluate 

risks related to routine and non-routine tasks. For routine 

tasks, a Job Safety and Environmental Analysis (JSEA) is 

completed to identify health and safety hazards before 

starting work in a site, to identify any unique hazards 

associated with the job or work environment. Wilmar uses 

the hierarchy of controls when identifying control measures.

Raising EHS awareness among our employees is crucial, 

beyond having in place standards and systems, to prevent 

workplace accidents. One of the WIMS requirements is that 

all our workers attend relevant EHS training, especially for 

those performing higher risk tasks. We conduct regular 

trainings and provide access to education materials in 

relevant languages to ensure that our workers are up to 

date on requirements and best practices.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted travel and face-to-

face trainings, we have built a new learning management 

system in collaboration with our Group IT to complement 

our current training programmes. We have since been 

developing training materials which can be accessed by 

our employees and workers online. Going forward, we will 

be focusing on high-risk work training using the system 

before looking into other areas.

All of our employees and workers are provided with 

personal protective equipment (PPE) and best practices 

on health and safety are shared between sites. In some of 

our operations, workers and their families have access to 

on-site clinics for free. In our facilities where we do not have 

clinics on-site, we establish an agreement with a nearby 

hospital to ensure quick medical treatment should the need 

arise. We will provide health insurance for employees, with 

some covering family members as well, across most of our 

operations. However, our provision of health insurance 

excludes Australia and New Zealand, as both countries 

have excellent free medical services. 

We strive to 

ensure the 

general well-

being of our 

employees, 

workers and all 

those involved 

in Wilmar’s 

operations.

materials and gap assessment tools in 2016. 

Since then, these are regularly revised 

and updated to provide guidance, build

• 

Hand and Finger Safety  

Campaign (India): 

Following an increase in reported cases of 

hand and finger injuries at our production 

facility in Neemuch, India, a Hand and 

Finger Safety Campaign was rolled out. The 

campaign was based on the findings from an 

audit on machine guarding that we carried 

out. It involved training all workers to ensure 

they understand machine guarding methods, 

roles and responsibilities. We observed 

improvements in the way workers behaved 

around machinery and a reduction in injuries.

and appropriate controls to be implemented, 

we rolled out our Danger Prediction 

Programme. Targeted at workers conducting 

non-routine and high-risk routine tasks, the 

programme helped to reduce the rate of 

incidents. More significantly, the health and 

safety awareness of workers increased, as we 

observed improved practices around safety. 

• 

Piloting an Intelligent  

Safety System (China): 

An Intelligent Safety System was introduced 

at our Hangzhou facility in China, as a 

platform for effective safety management 

and supervision. The system uses the new 

generation of information technologies, 

including Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial 

Intelligence (AI), big data among others, to 

enhance safety monitoring. For example, 

if workers do not wear proper PPE such as 

safety helmets or harnesses in the loading and 

unloading areas, an alarm and notification will 

be triggered to inform supervisors, who can 

monitor adherence through computers and 

mobile phones. This system helps to promote 

the safety of our workers by providing 

efficient supervision.

 

• 

Emergency Response  

Preparedness (Australia): 

All of our sugar mills have a trained 

Emergency Response Team (ERT) on site 

to provide the first response to emergency 

situations until the arrival of an external 

emergency service. ERT members at 

our Invicta Mill near Giru in Queensland, 

Australia, were given a guided tour of an 





ambulance to help better prepare them 

for potential emergency situations on-site. 

Giru’s Queensland Ambulance Service (QAS) 

paramedics showed team members inside 

the vehicle and gave them the opportunity 

to familiarise themselves with some of the 

medical equipment. The visit was also an 

opportunity for the team to learn about how 

they can most effectively assist paramedics 

responding to an emergency.

• 

Introducing an industry leading Learning 

Management System (LMS) (Australia): 

Goodman Fielder introduced an industry-

leading LMS platform with the objective to 

standardise the delivery of HSE training. 

The platform has since expanded to include 

Quality, Sales and Marketing content and 

offers more than 180 individual training 

courses. With over 3,900 users, Goodman 

Fielder employees have completed over 

28,000 courses to date. 

• 

Environmental Health &amp; Safety  

(EHS) Awareness Week (Ghana): 

Our Benso Oil Palm Plantation (BOPP) 

estate in Ghana introduced an annual EHS 

Awareness week for the entire workforce and 

school pupils. Following the theme “If it is not 

safe, don’t do it”, the 2020 awareness week 

involved discussions on relevant policies, EHS 

performance throughout the year and plans 

going forward. We also organised a quiz 

competition as a fun way to help retain some 

of the key messages from the week. 

• 

Wilmar Safety Observation  

(WILSO) Programme (Indonesia): 

Our subsidiary PT. MNA Serang in Banten 

Province, Indonesia, implemented WILSO 

in order to improve safety awareness and 

prevent the occurrence of accidents. The 

ongoing programme targets around 50 

people in supervisor positions and above each 

year. The programme focuses on encouraging 

better communication among employees, 

identifying the root causes of unsafe working 

practices and promoting the principle that 

“all injuries can be prevented”. Accidents 

have decreased since the implementation 

of WILSO, highlighting the important role 

supervisors and management play in creating 

a safe working environment. 

 

• 

Improving FFB harvesting safety near 

overhead power lines (Indonesia): To ensure 

the safety of our workers harvesting FFB near 

overhead power lines, we have an ongoing 

programme targeting approximately 500 

individuals each year. The programme trains 

our teams, including harvesters, field officers, 

field conductors and harvesting foremen on 

safe harvesting techniques. We also provide 

adequate equipment, including insulator 

poles and guide individuals on the proper use, 

maintenance and storage of this equipment. 

This has helped to raise awareness of the risks 

and proper practices that need to be applied. 

Most importantly, it has helped to prevent 

injuries and fatalities.

IN ADDITION TO GROUP LEVEL EHS PLAN AND PROGRAMME, OUR VARIOUS OPERATIONS TEAMS ACROSS 

DIFFERENT BUSINESSES HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES:

EHS reporting, incident reporting 

and investigations

We believe in cultivating an open reporting culture and have 

been building a global EHS reporting platform through the 

Enablon software. It helps us manage EHS performance, 

ensure compliance with relevant laws, minimise risks and 

drive efficiencies. The platform was first introduced in 

2016 and has been rolled out to all sites where Wilmar 

has operational control. 

Wilmar has also developed an Incident Reporting and 

Investigation Standard that all sites are required to follow in 

the instance of a work-related incident. The standard details 

how incidents are to be investigated and managed, as well 

as putting in place corrective and preventive actions. It also 

stipulates the process for reporting incidents, including on 

Enablon. All of our employees and workers can remove 

themselves and report situations that they believe could 

cause injury or ill health, without fear of reprisal.

In January 2020, Wilmar formalised a Fatality and 

Permanent Disability Incident Process, stipulating that 

disciplinary action will take place at the site’s senior 

management level should systems and training fall short of 

required standards. Through this more stringent approach, 

we hope to avoid any repeat incidences which could have 

been reasonably avoided through proper execution of 

improvement plans.

We regret to report 19 work-related fatalities among 

our employees and contractors in 2020. Ten and seven 

fatalities occurred in our factory and palm plantations 

respectively and nine involved contractors. The three most 

common causes included vehicle accidents, health or 

medical conditions and fall from heights. Any loss of life 

is unacceptable to Wilmar and we will continue to strive to 

eliminate fatalities in our operations. We will continue to 

strengthen our SOPs and our High Risk Work Intervention 

Programmes, especially Traffic Management and Work at 

Height programmes.

We believe in cultivating an open 

reporting culture and have been building 

a global EHS reporting platform.

NOTE: There were no loss time injuries at our sugarcane plantations  

in 2018 and 2019.  

Wilmar’s Lost Time Injury Rate (LTIR) has slightly increased 

by 2% from 0.89 in 2019 to 0.91 in 2020, partly due to 

improvements in our reporting and a classification 

of incidents. Out of the Lost Time Injuries (LTI), 80%  

were recorded in our oil palm plantations and 14% in our 

factories worldwide.

In 2020, 8,822 Lost Work Days (LWD) were recorded 

compared to 12,199 in 2019. Overall, we have reduced 

our Lost Work Day Rate (LWDR) by 30%. A reduction 

has been recorded in all business segments. More than 

3,000 lost days have been avoided (mainly from our  

factories and palm oil mills) through High Risk Work 

Intervention Programmes.

PERMANENT DISABILITY (PD):  

EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS







LOOKING AFTER OUR EMPLOYEES 

DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

Keeping our employees and workers safe during the 

COVID-19 pandemic has been an ongoing priority. This 

not only included putting effective health measures in 

place to keep employees and workers healthy and safe, 

but also ensuring that their mental well-being is being 

cared for amidst lockdowns and various other restrictions 

being imposed across the world. 

 

Three of our factories are located in Wuhan,  

the epicentre of the pandemic. With China reacting 

swiftly and therefore successful in managing the spread 

of the virus, we were able to package the standard 

operations procedures, policies and practices used for our 

China operations and roll them out to all our operations 

globally. This reduces the need for our operations in each 

region to develop a new procedure.

 Our colleagues at Wilmar Sugar Australia in support of mental health 

awareness through the 'R U OK' initiative

SUPPORTING THE R U OK? INITIATIVE: 

Wilmar Sugar Australia supports the national R U OK? 

initiative through efforts to raise mental health awareness 

amongst employees and workers. This encourages them 

to reach out and support colleagues who may be going 

through a difficult time. In 2020, a Mental Health Week 

was organised, with information sessions set for each 

day in the week on the following topics: Well-being at 

work; Moving well; Sleeping well; And eating well. To 

encourage individuals to have a conversation, we offered 

vouchers for a free coffee which could be redeemed 

with another person only. We also held a Teal and Purple 

day which focused on domestic violence and suicide 

awareness, developing the slogan ‘Break the Silence – 

Stop the Violence.’  

Wilmar Sugar is also running a programme called ‘Firing 

on all Cylinders’ which consists of two days focusing on 

achieving high performance by better management of 

the physical, emotional, spiritual and mental energies. 

Currently this programme is only targeted for managers.

PROVIDING FREE ACCOMMODATION 

TO FACTORY WORKERS: 

YKA provides free accommodation for employees in 

many of our factories. Dormitory rooms are equipped 

with desks, chairs, air-conditioning and en-suite 

washrooms. Facilities include gymnasium, badminton 

halls, nursing rooms, reading rooms and canteens. In 

addition, we organise a number of events, including 

games and other team bonding activities. We also 

provide bus transportation between the dormitory  

and factory. For workers, these arrangements greatly 

reduce living costs and helps to create good relationships 

amongst colleagues and better integrate them as part of 

the YKA team.

Health and well-being

Beyond operational health and safety, we recognise that 

employees who are healthy and well-looked after contribute 

to the productivity and success of the company. We are 

committed to promoting the well-being of our workforce 

by implementing various initiatives that support work-life 

balance and healthy habits in the workplace and at home. 

For example, annual medical check-ups are required in most 

of our operations. In some parts of the business and for 

certain roles, we also require workers to undergo on-going 

medical assessments to ensure that they are fit to work and 

have not suffered any unintentional consequences from 

more hazardous tasks. Some of our operations also provide 

group personal accident insurance, offering employees with 

added security should they encounter an accident, and 

reducing the burden of medical expenses on them. In line 

with our Women’s Charter, we also take into consideration 

and cater for women’s well-being.

Across our operations, we organise a range of Health and 

Wellness initiatives to promote well-being. These cover a 

wide range of areas, including smoking cessation, exercise, 

nutrition, vaccination, domestic violence and mental health.

403-6

We continue to follow government guidelines where we 

operate, including work from home measures. We also 

enabled flexible work arrangements for our employees 

based on their preference. Some of our country heads 

have also implemented “coffee time” to allow their 

employees to have open conversations and share their 

concerns. These measures have enabled us to continue 

operating with minimal disruptions and ensure a safe  

and healthy workplace for all workers.

   WILMAR SUGAR  

 

We implemented a range of measures to manage the 

threat posed by COVID-19 to our people and their 

families, as well as our contractors, customers and the 

broader community. We introduced a COVID-19 Guideline 

which includes health controls, safe distancing measures 

at worksites, restrictions on face-to-face meetings and 

a stringent cleaning regime. More recently, we also 

introduced COVID-19 Safe Plans to enable return  

of office workers to the workplace, in line with 

government guidelines.

   OIL PALM PLANTATIONS  

 

In our oil palm plantations, we established COVID-19 

Management and Implementation Teams responsible 

for putting in place a strategy for handling operations 

and develop guidelines. These teams are generally 

made up of plantation and mill operations, purchasing, 

sustainability, EHS, women’s committee, human resources 

and plantation health service personnel. 

Since March, we have introduced special SOPs that have 

been guiding our operations. These SOPs are localised 

and have been implemented in Malaysia, Indonesia, 

Ghana and Nigeria. SOPs cover our mill and plantation 

operations, as well as housing areas within our operations 

and dealings with external people. The structure and 

format of the SOPs differ regionally as they are designed 

to take into account each country’s context. Examples of 

measures include:

1. Increased focus on sanitation. We set up hand washing 

and sanitising stations and placed posters showing the 

importance of and proper hand washing techniques. 

To accommodate the shortage of hand sanitisers, we 

diverted some of our R&amp;D labs to produce alcohol-based 

hand sanitisers using the WHO guidelines for local 

production. These hand sanitisers have been distributed 

internally for use by workers in Wilmar, as well as to local 

communities. We also continue to regularly disinfect work 

areas and other key places in our plantations, using a 

solution of sodium hypochlorite.

2. Social distancing measures: We enforced safe 

distancing measures (of at least 1.5 meters) during  

field operations such as during muster, in worker 

transport and in facilities like clinics and creches  

where they remain open. 

3. Regular screening of COVID-19 symptoms:  

We conduct regular health screenings of COVID-19 

symptoms by specially trained staff equipped with infra-

red thermometers. Checks are done prior to entrance 

to enclosed workplaces such as offices and mills, as well 

as during muster - before workers leave for their various 

field sites. Regular checks are also done for all residents  

in plantation housing.

    WUHAN FACTORY  

 

In February 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic entered a 

critical stage in Wuhan and a city lockdown was enforced 

impacting many lives. During this time, residents saw a 

shortage of many food staples and everyday items.Wilmar 

sent a care package to our employees based in Wuhan 

containing edible oils, rice, noodles and surgical masks.

Economic and 

community 

contribution

Wilmar’s long term success is based on being a valued 

partner to the communities where we operate. We 

recognise that our activities can have varying degrees 

of economic, social and environmental impacts on our 

communities. As an integrated business of our size and 

with a presence across the entire value chain of food 

production, we are in a unique position to enhance 

livelihoods and contribute to socio-economic development. 

We are committed to using our experience on the ground 

to support rural development and enhance the livelihoods 

of oil palm smallholder farmers and sugar cane outgrowers. 

We also allocate funds towards community investment 

and philanthropic activities that support specific causes 

and the underprivileged. We rely on effective stakeholder 

engagement and meaningful partnerships to have a lasting 

positive impact.

Supporting rural development

In our palm oil operations, we provide infrastructure and 

programmes that support rural development. This includes 

the building of schools, housing for our workers, roads for 

better access to and around our plantations and more. 

Supporting oil palm smallholder farmers

Smallholders are a critical part of the palm oil industry 

but face unique challenges in terms of their productivity, 

profitability and sustainability. Smallholders account for 

8.4% of Wilmar’s fresh fruit bunches (FFB) supply base. 

In 2020, we received 120,111 metric tonnes of FFB from 

10,738 scheme smallholders and 614,572 metric tonnes of 

FFB from 25,876 independent smallholders — 1.4% and 

7% of our total supply respectively.

We are committed to ensuring that 100% of our 

independent smallholders covered by our programmes 

have access to a platform for expertise and the sharing 

of best practices in order to help them achieve NDPE 

compliance and enhance their livelihoods. Currently 100% 

of our scheme smallholders and 73% of our independent 

smallholders are covered by our programmes. We aim 

to reach 100% of our independent smallholders through 

our programmes by 2020 for Ghana, 2023 for Nigeria and 

2025 for Indonesia.













PROVIDING LIVESTOCK AND VEGETABLE 

FARMING TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES  

IN INDONESIA

To empower villages in North Sumatra, Indonesia, 

we donated over 100 goats over the course of 2020. 

As one of the most common livestock in Indonesian 

communities, goats are relatively easy to breed and 

support the economic needs of villages. In addition 

to goats, we provided villages with vegetable seeds, 

water pumps, hoses and plastic drums.  

PROVISION OF HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE 

FOR WORKERS AT OUR PLANTATIONS

We provide all workers on plantations with adequate 

housing to make sure they can live comfortably and 

have access to all essential amenities. For example, 

in Malaysia, we provide different types of housing 

to accommodate for families of different sizes. We 

also build clinics, crèches, shops, canteens, religious 

buildings, community halls, schools and more to 

ensure workers and their families have access to 

various types of facilities. 

Wilmar’s long-

term success 

is based on 

being a valued 

partner to the 

communities 

where we 

operate.

OUR SCHEME 

SMALLHOLDERS PROGRAMMES

Our scheme smallholder programmes focus on providing 

training and support for farmers to improve sustainability 

practices, increase yield per hectare and ultimately achieve 

certification under applicable national certifications schemes 

and RSPO. 

* The planted area under the government-originated plasma scheme 

in Indonesia has reduced over the years due to the lapsing of MOUs 

with these smallholders who have since become independent as they 

no longer sell their FFB exclusively to Wilmar. 

SUPPORTING INDEPENDENT SMALLHOLDERS

Our independent smallholder programmes are specific to 

each country and aim to address the unique challenges 

faced by farmers in their respective locations. For example, 

in Malaysia, we have received requests for support around 

the provision and application of fertilisers. In Ghana, farmers 

require support around best agronomic practices. Our 

programmes also sometimes help farmers achieve relevant 

certification although it is not exclusively an objective.

We implemented smallholder programmes,  

in collaboration with Wild Asia, at three of our 

mills in Sabah. The programmes focus on capacity-

building and facilitating a fertiliser credit scheme 

to help farmers increase their yield, adopt more 

sustainable agriculture practices and ultimately 

achieve MSPO and RSPO certification. Out of 722 

smallholders supplying our mills in 2020, 223# took 

part in this programme.

Uptake has not been as extensive as we had 

hoped for several reasons, including the fact that 

oil palm cultivation is not the main income for a 

number of these independent smallholders. While 

our agreement with Wild Asia has concluded in 

2020, we continue to support smallholders through 

the fertiliser programme and with 100% of the 

premiums going to those that are certified.

MALAYSIA

In Ghana, our subsidiary Benso Oil Palm  

Plantation (BOPP), based at the Adum Banso 

Estate in the Mpohor District in Western Ghana, 

has been running a 1,650 hectares oil palm 

smallholders’ scheme since 1994. We invited  

438 farmers from surrounding communities  

to be part of this scheme. 

The Agence Française de Developpement  

(AFD) provided loans to the farmers to develop 

their land through the Government of Ghana  

and the African Development Bank (ADB),  

which have been fully repaid.

Besides providing the land, we helped to set 

up the plantations through technical support. 

Smallholders have land use rights of up to 

25-years, clearly stipulated in the agreement  

and are committed to selling their FFB to  

BOPP exclusively at a guaranteed price. BOPP 

provides the technical support to the farmers to 

ensure they follow our sustainability standards.

The annual yield of these farmers is currently 

13.57 tonnes per hectare, higher than the average 

of 8 tonnes per hectare, contributing to 17% of 

the FFB processed by our mill. Together with our 

smallholders, we achieved RSPO certification in 

2014, becoming the first company in Ghana and 

the second in Africa to attain RSPO certification.

Following the success of our first programme  

and in response to requests from various 

community groups, we established the Adum 

Smallholder Scheme programme in 2018 to 

provide assistance to 300 smallholders in 

developing 1,400 hectares of their land into oil 

palm plantations. Co-financed with the Foreign, 

Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO), 

formerly the Department for International 

Development, this programme has a particular 

focus on protecting forests and biodiversity within 

the broader landscape. It was also designed with 

an alternative livelihood scheme (ALS) to help 

diversify farmers’ income through activities such 

as baking, poultry farming and beekeeping. It 

is especially important to provide an additional 

source of income for farmers as new plantings take 

an average of four years to mature. It also helps 

farmers to repay the initial loan that was given 

to them. We completed the RSPO New Planting 

Procedure and initiated 400 hectares of planting 

which is currently being allocated to farmers. 

In Indonesia, independent smallholders  

face a number of challenges including access  

to quality seedlings, knowledge on best  

agronomic practices, market access for selling 

FFB to mills directly, and obtaining legal land 

titles. Obtaining ISPO certification is now also a 

requirement from the Indonesian government, 

something many independent smallholders 

struggle to work towards.

Our programme focuses on helping smallholders to 

address some of these challenges by:

• 

Facilitating access to high yielding seedlings 

and high-quality fertilisers

• 

Providing training on sustainable agronomic 

practices, including the proper application of 

fertiliser and analysing the health of the soil 

for optimum growing conditions 

• 

Supporting with the certification process, first 

with ISPO and then towards RSPO. 

• 

Providing guaranteed access to selling FFB to 

our mills, including providing clarity on prices 

and helping them manage income flow. 

To roll out this programme, we have partnered with 

nine co-operatives of independent smallholders in 

the provinces of Jambi, Riau and Sumatra – with 

around 5,000 farmers participating. Five co-

operatives have achieved ISPO certification in 2020, 

covering 2,200 hectares of land. 

Since 2017, participation has increased from 8,864 

to 19,337#, accounting for 77% of our independent 

smallholders in Indonesia.

INDONESIA

In Indonesia, scheme smallholder requirements are 

set by the government. Wilmar has a total planted 

area of over 8,300 hectares under government-

originated plasma schemes*. We support these 

smallholders in obtaining land legality, initial 

financing for development and land preparation, as 

well as through the provision of planting materials 

such as seedlings, fertilisers and pest control. 

We also provide technical assistance on good 

agricultural practices. When oil palm trees reach 

maturity or when the plasma co-operatives are well 

established, the small plantation plots are generally 

handed over to smallholder co-operatives for self-

management. While their oil palms are maturing, 

we employ many of these farmers and provide 

them with training in essential agronomic skills so 

they are equipped to manage their own plots and 

ultimately achieve ISPO and RSPO certification.

BOPP and Earthworm Foundation (formerly 

The Forest Trust), began collaborating 

on a   Rurality project in 2015. Rurality is 

an initiative by Earthworm Foundation to 

increase smallholders’ resilience through 

capacity building, in particular by looking 

after the environment and reinforcing 

farmers’ relationships with strategic players 

in the supply chain.  

In this project, BOPP played a key role by 

running training programmes for farmers on 

best farm management practices; supplying 

farming materials including pesticides and 

fertilisers to farmers on credit; providing 

farmers with heavy machinery such as 

excavators to build infrastructure; and 

providing empty fruit bunch (EFB) mulch to 

help to improve the soil quality. 

Farmers have benefitted from an increase 

in average yield per hectare of land though 

better access to fertiliser and other farming 

materials and from training on sustainable 

agricultural practices. Farmers also benefit 

from new infrastructure that was built, 

including drains and roads. 

While our partnership with Earthworm 

Foundation on this Rurality project was 

concluded in 2019, BOPP continues to  

build the resilience of independent 

smallholders, with the support of BOPP 

Outside Purchased Fruits (OPF) managers 

and estate surveyors. In 2020, we continued 

to conduct these training sessions on  

Best Management Practices (BMP) with  

site visits for 22# smallholders before 

traveling was curtailed.

Our plantations in Nigeria are relatively 

young. In 2017, we started our own pilot 

outgrower scheme on 150 hectares of land 

and with 43 farmers from the surrounding 

areas of Wilmar’s Biase Plantation Ltd. 

(BPL) at Cross River state. The planted 

area has yet to mature in 2020 and BPL 

continues to work with outgrowers to 

establish their plantations, following our 

sustainable agricultural procedures. The 

company also provides low interest funding 

for the entire project.

Based on the success of this project, we 

were able to engage with the Central Bank 

of Nigeria who agreed to provide funding 

to scale up this project. In 2020, we had 

originally targeted to plant an area of 200 

hectares and involve 400 farmers, however 

due to delays caused by COVID-19, 

we only managed to plant 30 hectares 

covering 4 farmers. By 2023, we still aim 

to cover a total 1,540 farmers with 6,000 

hectares of planted area.

In partnership with Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd. (SRSL), Solidaridad Asia and Coca-Cola Foundation, we have been 

supporting sugarcane outgrowers associated with SRSL in adopting sustainable and climate-smart sugarcane farming 

since 2017. The programme focuses on: 

1. 

Training and capacity building:

 

We conducted remote training during the COVID-19 lockdown 

for farmers and once restrictions were lifted, in-person 

training ahead of the crushing season in November. As of end 

December 2020, a total of 22,438 sugarcane growers had been 

trained. Trainings covered topics, including: 

• 

Health and safety measures

• 

Financial literacy

• 

Best Management Practices (BMP) in sugarcane farming 

including using quality seeds, wide-row planting, soil 

testing, integrated nutrient management, adoption of 

micro-irrigation system and an integrated approach 

for pest and disease management for achieving higher 

productivity with reduced production cost

• 

Scientific Ratoon Management Practices (SRMP)  

including: No-trash burning practices and using in-situ 

mulching to conserve moisture, control weeds and enrich 

soil fertility; stubble shaving to encourage tillering from 

ground; Shoulder breaking to establish new root systems; 

and early application of basal dose of fertilisers, all  

of which contribute to enhanced productivity  

on par with plant cane  

• 

Installation of ‘Light Traps’ to catch and kill adult beetles

• 

The application of Metarizhium to control  

root grub menace

• 

The importance of growing green manure crops to 

improve soil health.

2. 

Introducing “Supercane Nursery Technology”

 

Sugarcane farmers had been procuring pre-raised seedlings 

from private vendors at an average of price of Rs.2.25-2.75 

(US$ 0.03-0.04) per seedling, costing between Rs.13,750-

16,250 (US$ 186.77- 220.73) per acre depending on cane 

variety and spacing to be adopted. Since July 2019, we 

introduced Supercane Nursery Technology to the farmers, 

which had been developed by Dr. Mahadev Balakrishna 

Jamadagni, a retired Agri-Scientist from Kolhapur 

(Maharashtra). This method uses materials that are readily 

available on farms, including empty plastic fertiliser bags, 

to produce seedlings at a fraction of the cost, between 

3. 

Organising Field Days

 

Using the principle of “seeing is believing” from the “Farmer-

to-Farmers” programme, we organised Field Days for 

progressive farmers at different locations to showcase the 

results of BMP. The media was also invited to Field Days to 

help raise awareness and confidence of BMP among the cane 

farming community. We have observed that farmers adopting 

BMP are benefiting from higher cane productivity of up to 

246 metric tonnes per hectare without much increase on the 

production cost.

4. 

Trialling sugarcane variety at R&amp;D Farm, Pathri

 

Due to climate uncertainties during the South-West  

Monsoon between June and September and the availability  

of water along the river and canal network, farmers in the 

‘Cane Command Area’ of Pathri take up cultivation of crops 

such as soybean and cotton during the Kharif season,  

followed by cane cultivation, resulting in late and counter 

planting of cane between November and February.  

This creates difficulties in systematic management of  

cane procurement and the realisation of low sugar  

recovery owing to lower age at harvest.  

We have conducted a trial during 2020 at one of our R&amp;D 

farms in Pathri over an area of 1.2 hectares by involving 3 

maturing varieties – Co11015 (extra-early), Co09004 (early) 

and Co86032 (mid-late) maturing – to assess yield and quality 

parameters. While, Co11015 profuse flowering variety, it didn’t 

flower under Pathri locations and was found suitable for late 

month plantations from November, which resulted in a higher 

sugar recovery percentage even at 9 months age. This variety 

is being distributed to farmers to create a larger quantity of 

planting material and cover a larger extent during the next 

planting season.

PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE AND CLIMATE-SMART SUGARCANE FARMING IN INDIA

CERTIFICATION STATUS OF OUR SCHEME 

AND INDEPENDENT SMALLHOLDERS

Out of 10,545 total hectares (including 10,011 planted 

hectares) owned by scheme smallholders, 3,237 hectares 

(30.7%) in Indonesia and Ghana are RSPO certified. This 

contributed to 8,569 metric tonnes of certified sustainable 

palm oil (CSPO) and 2,014 metric tonnes of certified 

sustainable palm kernel (CSPK) produced in 2020, about 

1% of our total certified output. We also sourced 44,038 

metric tonnes of FFB from independent smallholders 

that was RSPO certified, accounting for 7.2% of the total 

independent supply sourced. 



Supporting sugar outgrowers

We have implemented training programmes for sugar 

outgrowers in Myanmar and India, covering good farming 

practices for land preparation, planting systems, cane 

nutrient requirements, fertiliser application, weed control 

and the safe handling and application of chemicals. In 

Myanmar, we invited the farmers from Madaya Sugar Mill's 

area to our farms and shared our advance cane planting 

system with them to help improve their cane yield. We 

also sell fertilisers to our outgrowers with a longer credit 

period compared to outside dealers. In 2020, 521 farmers 

purchased 336 tonnes of fertilisers through this programme. 



70-80 Paise (US$ 0.009-0.011) per seedling. These seedlings 

are also ready for planting within 21 days and can be kept up 

to 45 days under unfavourable weather conditions (non-vapsa) 

for planting.

Community investment  

and philanthropic activities

In 2020, Wilmar contributed over US$36.76 million* 

towards community investment and philanthropic 

activities. This included mostly direct cash contributions, 

but also employee volunteering time, in-kind donations 

and management costs. Employees are encouraged to 

volunteer. This is something that is managed by each 

country/business head and unfortunately was more limited 

in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions.

As a group, we support a number of causes we believe we 

can make meaningful contributions to, including education, 

health and well-being and community welfare. 

In China, YKA has been supporting charity projects since 

2007. In 2013, 29 companies in the YKA group donated 

RMB 30 million (approximately US$ 4.58 million) and set 

up the Arawana Charity Foundation. Arawana volunteers 

took the lead in carrying forward the legacy of Yihai Kerry’s 

charitable principles and charity projects. To date, six main 

programmes exist, including the Yihai Kerry Education Aid 

Programme, Arawana Sight Restoration Project, Arawana 

Culinary School, Arawana Scholarships, supporting orphans 

and people with disabilities and providing disaster relief.

Goodman Fielder set up the Goodman Fielder Cares Trust, 

with the core mandate of fighting hunger and poverty in 

New Zealand. The Trust has a bread donation programme, 

an employee volunteering programme and an employee 

workplace giving programme. As a registered trust, we 

can ensure complete transparency with all donations being 

distributed to charitable programmes. Since its launch 

in 2013, Goodman Fielder employees have raised over 

NZ$ 100,000 (approximately US$ 72,210) through a range 

of fundraising initiatives. These funds are distributed to 

organisations that are helping to feed the hungry in New 

Zealand.





EDUCATION

Wilmar believes that access to education is the catalyst 

to poverty alleviation, especially for rural families. We 

continue to manage or support over 70 schools where 

we operate – 38 in China, 15 in Indonesia, 19 in Malaysia 

and six in Africa. 

We also provide scholarships and bursaries for 

underprivileged students with academic potential. The 

Wilmar Scholarship, established by Wilmar in 2009 and 

the Kuok Khoon Hong (KKH) Scholarship, established 

by our CEO Mr Kuok Khoon Hong in 2012, provide 

undergraduates with the opportunity to embrace a holistic 

education and achieve greater heights of excellence. We 

work with various educational institutions in Singapore. 

To date, more than 350 undergraduates have received a 

scholarship and since 2016, more than 50 bursaries have 

been awarded.

Since 2017, Wilmar and our subsidiary PPB Oil Palms 

Berhad (PPBOP) have been offering students who want 

to pursue agriculture science and related courses the Goh 

Ing Sing Agriculture Science Scholarship. In 2020, the 

scholarship was offered to 45 students. This scholarship 

was set up by Wilmar in memory of the late Mr Goh Ing 

Sing, who was Wilmar’s Group Plantations Head until his 

passing in August 2016.

In China, the Arawana Scholarship was set up to provide 

children of migrant workers in cities and children from poor 

rural families in western China with the means to continue 

their studies. As of the end of 2020, a total of 17 universities 

and research institutions across the country have set up 

Arawana Scholarships (including the previous "Yihai Kerry 

Scholarship"). In 2020 alone, nearly 818 undergraduates, 

graduate students and young teachers have won Arawana 

Scholarships and fellowship awards.

In Ghana, 25 employees’ children and 5 students from 

surrounding communities were awarded full BOPP Tertiary 

Scholarships in 2019 and 2020.

Wilmar has ongoing programmes to upgrade schools 

in Indonesia, Nigeria and Ghana to ensure they are 

equipped with suitable facilities, including computer 

labs, science labs and libraries. We also aim to ensure 

that school facilities can accommodate extracurricular 

activities, such as music, arts and sports. The 

redevelopment programme annually benefits between 

6,500 and 7,000 children from pre-primary school age 

through to secondary school age. Progress on the 

number of schools upgraded:

Starting in 2007, the Yihai Kerry Education Aid 

Programme was launched by YKA to improve the 

conditions of schools and levels of education in 

underprivileged regions. To maximise our impact, 

locations eligible for the programme must be in 

deprived areas, with urgent needs and without local 

government support. 

We ensure that members of YKA’s engineering and 

technical teams participate in every aspect of the 

planning, design and construction phases to ensure 

the quality of the schools. Following the completion 

of schools, a team of volunteers comprising YKA 

employees actively work with the principal and 

teachers to discuss the school curriculum. 

As of the end of 2020, YKA and the Arawana Charity 

Foundation have funded 38 Yihai schools in 16 

provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions 

across the country. There are currently more than 

16,000 students studying and more than 1,200 

teachers working at these schools.

Since 2006, Wilmar has initiated a collaboration with 

the Borneo Child Aid Society, known locally as Humana, 

a CSO dedicated to assisting marginalised children. In 

partnership, we wanted to bring free and basic education 

to the children’s doorstep, rather than the children 

seeking education outside of our plantations in the 

state of Sabah, Malaysia. At the same time, this would 

encourage the parents, who are plantation workers, to 

allow their children to attend classes and reduce their 

burden to provide education and caregiving during 

working hours. 

Wilmar helped to: 

• 

Find suitable and conducive venues to build a school, 

accessible within the plantation. 

• 

Provide furniture and other basic amenities

• 

Source all teaching materials and stationery, including 

audio-visual materials to aid in teaching

• 

Provide accommodation and other benefits  

for teachers

• 

Organise transport for students to ensure that they 

get to school on time, reducing the financial burdens 

for parents

• 

Supply students with free uniforms and textbooks 

• 

Undertake all running costs associated with the 

operation and maintenance of the school 

The workers’ children have access to quality education 

aligned with the national school syllabus. In Sabah, we 

have established 17 units of Humana Schools and 10 units 

of Community Learning Centers (CLC), with 1,385 children 

attending. In Sarawak, we have established two units of 

CLC with 195 children attending. Since 2009, 74 students 

from our CLC in Sarawak have pursued tertiary education 

in Indonesian universities.

We were not able to complete the upgrade of the last school in Nigeria due to COVID-19.

Wilmar contributed US$ 1 million to the Indonesian 

government for the purchasing of COVID-19 test kits 

and face masks. 

 

As of December 2020, at local plantation and mill operations level, a total US$ 314,381 

has been contributed in the form of PPE, medicines, food (including rice, flour, sugar, 

cooking oil, etc), disinfectants, hygiene facilities and other essentials to the local 

communities under the Wilmar Peduli (Wilmar Cares) programme. Besides that, to help 

counteract the lack of available face masks, Wilmar’s Womens’ Committee members in 

our Central Kalimantan plantations have come together to make 12,000 cloth face masks 

for distribution to workers’ families and local community members.

Through the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Tawau,  

we donated approximately US$ 23,000 for the purchase 

of 2 ventilators for the Tawau Hospital. 

 

We also contributed approximately US$ 104,000 worth of COVID-19 test kits for the 

Ministry of Health via the Malaysian Palm Oil Association and channelled an additional 

contribution of approximately US$ 23,000 via the Palm Oil Refiners Association of 

Malaysia (PORAM) to the Ministry of Primary Industries and Commodities Covid-19 fund. 

Additionally, in collaboration with the Kuok Group of companies in Malaysia, we donated:

• 

70,000 surgical masks and respirator face masks to 11 hospitals

• 

1,000 litres of hand sanitisers to 10 hospitals

• 

Approximately US$ 33,000 of medical equipment to the University Malaya Medical 

Centre Kuala Lumpur 

• 

Approximately US$ 23,000 worth of foodstuff provided via the government and 3 

charitable organisations to be distributed to poor families and the homeless

We contributed approximately US$ 175,000 in items  

and cash to the Ghanaian government’s COVID-19 fund. 

 

We also distributed soap, thermometers, facemasks and Veronica buckets to dispense 

water for handwashing at a value of approximately US$ 45,000 to the communities 

surrounding our BOPP plantation. In addition, our BOPP’s clinic remained open for all 

community members needing health services during the pandemic. We have carried out 

awareness raising campaigns of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures for precaution to 

local community members. In anticipation of any possible disruption to food supplies we 

ensured that plantation shops were fully stocked, working with major suppliers to make 

food items available at pre-pandemic wholesale prices. 

We contributed approximately US$ 11,000  

to the Cross River State’s COVID-19 task force to help 

manage the spread of the virus, where our plantation  

and mills are located. 

 

To help alleviate pressures on potential hardships, our plantation operations have 

distributed approximately US$ 50,000 worth of food items and other essentials to all 

workers as well as to communities around our operations.

Wilmar continues to support those in need of medical 

attention, especially cataract operations and prosthetic 

limb surgeries, as we strive to improve their quality of life. 

In China, we have funded over 28,000 cataract operations 

and over 1,000 prosthetic limb surgeries to date, of which 

850 cataract operations and 293 prosthetic limb surgeries 

were conducted in 2020.

The Arawana Charity Foundation’s "Respect for the Elderly 

and Children’s” project has always paid attention to the 

living conditions of vulnerable groups such as the elderly 

and disabled, and donated funds for the improvement of 

the living and rehabilitation conditions of these vulnerable 

groups. Activities undertaken as part of this project include 

the purchase of medical equipment for disabled children’s 

rehabilitation centres, and the construction of orphanages 

and nursing homes for the elderly. 

COMMUNITY WELFARE

In Australia, we continue to support the initiatives by our 

charity partner, Foodbank Australia, through Wilmar Sugar 

Australia and Goodman Fielder.  

Goodman Fielder has a long-standing partnership with 

Foodbank in Australia.  Our bakery business works closely 

with the local Foodbank teams to donate bread that is in 

surplus to our requirements. Across the Australian business 

we also have a process for donating products that are 

approaching the end of their shelf life, equating to more 

than 1 million meals each year. Goodman Fielder staff have 

also been involved in volunteering for Foodbank to help 

prepare hampers and distribute food.

Similarly, Wilmar Sugar donates products that are not fit 

for sale due to issues such as packaging defects, but that 

are still safe for human consumption. The aim is to support 

people and avoid food waste. We also sell products to 

Foodbank at wholesale prices when they request it.

Our contribution towards 

COVID-19 relief projects

We recognise the difficulties that the COVID-19 pandemic 

has brought to individuals, families and entire communities. 

As a company, we are doing what we can to help provide 

support and contribute to national or local initiatives to 

help those around us. Keeping our communities healthy 

allows us to continue operating sustainably.

We contributed over US$15.69 million to support local 

communities, government initiatives and our employees 

and workers during COVID-19. We helped to provide 

PPE, food products, medical equipment, disinfectant and 

hygiene products, as well as cash donations.




















Delivering 

product 

excellence

We ensure that we meet the highest standards of product 

safety and quality, while developing products that contribute 

to the health and well-being of consumers, with transparent 

product marketing and labelling. An important part of our 

strategy focuses on research and development (R&amp;D) to

propagation, a method that uses tissue culture to identify and select 

individual oil palm variations that are favourable in terms of yield 

performance and other parameters, suitable for mass cloning. In early 

2020, we established a new oil palm clonal lab in Central Kalimantan. We 

are scaling up production to reach a capacity of 500,000 clonal palms 

per year by 2026, ahead of our replanting programme in our Central 

Kalimantan Project (CKP) plantation which commences in 2022. Through 

these variations, we expect yield to improve between 13% to 32%. In 

parallel, efforts to continue with improvements through conventional 

breeding methods are conducted in PT Tania Selatan. 

We began collaborating with Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory (TLL) in 

2009 to conduct research on using genetic screening to shorten the palm 

breeding cycle. We are currently field testing selected genetic markers 

against fresh fruit bunches (FFB) yields in sampled palms that were 

supplied by our plantation in Palembang, Indonesia. We estimate that 

the final results can only be concluded in another two to three years. If 

found to be successful, this research may enable us to halve the breeding 

process time compared to conventional methods. The TLL team has 

also found that drought tolerant oil palm trees could be selected at the 

seedling stage via bioinformatic analysis of RNA-sequencing data. They 

also found a few DNA markers associated with Ganoderma resistance and 

are currently testing them.

We have our own plant breeding programme in Wilmar Sugar Australia, 

which is led by our Technical Field Department. We are trialling the use 

of Genomic Selection technology using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism 

(SNP) chips to identify ‘super’ parents that contain additive traits that will 

assist in improving cane yields and sugar content of their progeny.  

We believe that this process will also reduce the ‘end to end’ time  

from first selection to final distribution of new clonal material for  

commercial planting.

Wilmar has been working with Orillion, a New Zealand-based pest control 

expert, on a new rodenticide initiative to support our Integrated Pest 

Management (IPM) programme since 2017. Having identified the preferred 

rat bait, we are now field testing this rodenticide in a larger area. 

Wilmar Sugar Australia is exploring the use of mill by-products to increase 

farm productivity. Additionally, although in early stages, they are also 

working in collaboration with Sugar Research Australia (SRA) and the 

University of Queensland to develop a Genomic Selection programme for 

their plant breeding department.

YKA is generating electricity and steam by burning rice 

husks, which is rice-processing waste. Our Jiamusi plant 

generates about 50,000 tonnes of rice husks a year. By 

using these for electricity and steam generation, we are 

able to replace the use of 31,400 tonnes of coal which also 

reduces costs by more than US$ 900,000 and sulphur dioxide 

emissions by 3,620 tonnes. YKA then uses rice husk ash 

to produce silica and activated carbon which reduces the 

disposal of waste.

ENHANCING PRODUCT QUALITY 

ACROSS DIFFERENT SEGMENTS

Our palm oil products meet the most stringent requirement of 

3-MCPD fatty esters, which are chemical contaminants found in  

palm oil, through strict controls in our entire palm oil supply  

chain, including plantation management, milling, refining,  

and transportation.

Goodman Fielder worked with the Australian Export Grains 

Innovation Centre (AEGIC) to review the line set-up and recipe 

formulation to drive more efficient production of high-quality loaf 

bread in Australia and New Zealand against competitor products.  

We improved the overall quality scores of our bread in the areas  

of softness, whiteness, spreadability, resilience and the  

Health Star Rating.







As one of our core values, we embrace 

innovation across all our operations. 

The team has a number of initiatives 

we continue to work on, with new ideas 

and projects constantly being added 

to our pipeline. We look forward to 

sharing more of our work, findings and 

breakthroughs with our stakeholders 

in the future. More information on our 

current R&amp;D activities can be found 

throughout this report and on page 23 

of our Annual Report 2020.

LOOKING AHEAD

STUDYING FOOD SCIENCE TO  

UNDERSTAND THE HEALTH BENEFITS  

OF VARIOUS INGREDIENTS

In a five-year partnership, Wilmar, the National 

University of Singapore (NUS) and the National 

Research Foundation launched a US$110 million  

WIL@NUS Corporate Laboratory in Singapore 

in 2018. The laboratory, which is hosted by the Yong 

Loo Lin School of Medicine, is dedicated to driving 

innovation in food technology and sustainable 

biochemicals, combining NUS's world class 

experience in clinical research and trials.  

Over the last three years, an important study 

undertaken by WIL@NUS involved clinical trials to 

identify food ingredients that can better contribute 

to healthy living and promote healthy ageing. We 

have completed this trial and have published the 

results in the Journal of Nutrition. Other trials are 

ongoing but have been slow to progress due to the 

COVID-19 pandemic.

Goodman Fielder has continued our strategic partnership with 

High Value Nutrition Group in New Zealand. We have been 

awarded a grant to conduct a clinical trial in 2021-2022 on 

digestive health outcomes. We are also engaged as an industry 

partner in a project called "Milk Means More" to study, validate 

and leverage the health benefits of dairy products and to 

better understand the potential health benefits and consumer 

perceptions of novel plant proteins.

Consumer health 

and well-being

Wilmar is committed to providing consumers access 

to healthy, nutritious and affordable food especially in 

emerging markets. We are well-positioned to respond 

to consumer needs for healthier lifestyles through 

newly innovated and enhanced products with additional 

nutritious attributes.

Our edible food products range from vegetable oils to 

sugar, flour, rice, noodles, speciality fats, snacks, bakery 

and dairy products. Regardless of whether the product is 

distributed wholesale or sold directly to customers, the 

Wilmar consumer brands are renowned for their quality 

and reach five billion consumers worldwide. Our approach 

is centred on understanding the evolving science around 

nutrition and consumer preferences, to help us design and 

make market-leading, nutritious food products. We also 

believe in transparency, providing product information and 

educating our consumers. Starting with our own employees, 

we released the first internal Wilmar Nutrition Newsletter 

in September 2020. This is a good way to raise awareness 

on health and well-being topics and to provide Wilmar 

employees with factual news relating to progress on clinical 

trials, nutrition and health.

YKA is dedicated to improving consumer health and has 

been heavily investing in R&amp;D to enhance nutritional value 

across a wide range of products. Our oil products are the 

most influential range in China as a result of their health 

benefits, including reasonable fatty acid compositions 

and high vitamin E content. We have developed products 

derived from corn, rice and flaxseed. YKA has also 

developed multigrain, buckwheat and fermented noodles 

to promote good digestion and provide alternatives for 

diabetic consumers. 

Understanding and raising 

awareness on health and nutrition

Innovating to enhance  

nutritional value at YKA

We are passionate about understanding the link between 

diet and diseases, innovating products to improve the 

health and well-being of our consumers. We have built a 

health innovation platform in collaboration with the Chinese 

Nutrition Society. YKA pledged to invest RMB 100 million 

by 2023 to support scientific research and development, 

specifically targeting people with diabetes, the elderly 

and patients with cardiovascular diseases. We aim for this 

platform to help us improve nutritional research and develop 

more targeted products for consumers, which would 

improve health outcomes and reduce medical expenses. 

Our approach 

is centred on 

understanding the 

evolving science

Wilmar Sugar’s strategy around consumer health is to 

communicate the science of sugar and health to relevant 

stakeholders, including employees, policy makers, health 

professionals, customers and consumers. We have 

established the Sugar Nutrition Resource Centre (SNRC), 

funded by our joint venture with Mackay Sugar Limited.

SNRC provides a hub for evidence-based information on 

sugar for everyone to understand its role in nutrition and 

health. This information is based on the best available 

scientific evidence, with input from a group of expert 

scientists. It has a resource library with items to share 

including fact sheets, infographics, booklets and research.

Communicating the science 

of sugar at Wilmar Sugar

Goodman Fielder’s new purpose of “making everyday food 

better for everyone” places consumer health and well-being 

at the heart of everything we do. Some of the key areas 

we are targeting include developing fortified products that 

enhance digestive well-being and constitute low glucose 

according to the Glycemic Index (GI). We have also been 

working to support groups deficient in micronutrients such 

as indigenous communities.  

Goodman Fielder and Wilmar Sugar sell a range of products 

to consumers with health or nutritional attributes. For 

example, Goodman Fielder has hundreds of products across 

our portfolio with health and nutritional attributes, including 

loaves, flatbreads, flavour enhancers, sweet grocery and 

cake mixes, spreads and oils. Goodman Fielder has set a 

target to meaningfully improve the nutritional value of our 

products. This includes improving the health star-rating of 

50 million loaves of bread in 2021.

Health and well-being at the heart  

of Goodman Fielder’s purpose

We continue to work on improving the formulation of our 

current products and develop new ranges with specific 

health or nutrition attributes. Our research through  

WIL@NUS will continue to focus on food science, especially 

on plant protein and clinical trials on dietary intervention 

and microbiome analysis. Similarly, YKA will continue to 

research and develop heathy foods and nutritional feeds. 

Goodman Fielder will focus on developing new products 

to meet consumer needs with a focus on improving the 

nutritional profile of these products. This will be achieved 

by enhancing positive nutrients like protein, fibre, vitamins 

and minerals and reducing negative nutrients like sodium 

and saturated fat.

Continuing to drive product 

improvements through R&amp;D

The gut plays a huge role in our overall health and wellness. Goodman 

Fielder was the first business to launch a product aimed at promoting 

gut health and digestive well-being in the packaged bread aisle across 

Australia and New Zealand. Helga’s Digestive Wellbeing breads and 

wraps are baked using the unique BARLEYmax™ barley seeds, which 

contain a blend of prebiotic fibres such as fructans, beta glucan and 

resistant starch. These support digestive well-being by helping to feed 

the good bacteria in the gut. Launching this product range also involved 

increasing the interest of media and generating discussions related to 

digestive health and food as a key driver to exploring gut health.

Goodman Fielder has been collaborating with the Menzies School of 

Health Research, one of Australia's leading medical research institutes 

dedicated to improving the health and well-being of Aboriginal and 

Torres Strait Islander peoples. Since the 1980’s, we have developed a 

type of bread to help address the nutritional requirements of indigenous 

peoples. We initially developed a bread called Darwin Hi Fib, followed 

by Territory Hi Fib. Our current brand, Bush Oven Outback Bread, has 

been well received throughout indigenous communities and is helping to 

address common deficiencies in Folate, Fibre and Iron.

GOODMAN FIELDER’S IMPLEMENTATION 

OF NEW ‘HEALTH STAR RATING’

The Health Star Rating (HSR) in Australia 

and New Zealand is a voluntary front-of-

pack labelling system that rates the overall 

nutrition profile of packaged goods and 

assigns it a rating from ½ star to 5 stars. 

When comparing similar foods, it allows 

consumers to choose those with more  

stars which means they are making a 

healthier choice.  

The HSR system was developed  

by the Australian and New Zealand 

governments in consultation with public 

health experts, the food industry and 

consumer groups. The calculator that 

underpins that calculation of the star rating 

takes into consideration public health 

nutrients of concern (Energy (kJ), saturated 

fat, total sugars and sodium content) as well 

as positive nutrients such as protein and 

fibre, fruit and vegetable content.  

Goodman Fielder currently applies the  

HSR to our branded bread and dairy 

products. As a tool, HSR can be used  

to drive positive reformulation so as to 

improve a product’s overall nutrition profile, 

by reducing negative nutrients and/or 

increasing positive attributes. 

Product marketing 

and labelling

Product marketing and labelling helps consumers make 

informed purchasing decisions by providing relevant 

information on the health, safety origin, sustainability and 

responsible use of products. At Wilmar, we are committed 

to product transparency by marketing and labelling 

our products accurately, in accordance with relevant 

government regulations and using the high standards 

set by voluntary guidelines.

103-1, 103-2, 103-3

Responsible marketing and product labelling is the joint 

responsibility of several departments, including marketing, 

R&amp;D, product safety and legal. Our approach will also follow 

the specific regulatory context around the products at 

hand, as well as the countries we sell to. In general, we do 

follow some key basic principles across our operations. For 

example, as part of our commitment towards responsible 

marketing to children, we do not directly market products 

to children.

Goodman Fielder has robust internal procedures, systems 

and processes that ensure regulatory compliance with 

the strict product marketing and labelling legislations in 

Australia and New Zealand. Our internal regulatory and 

legal teams across international markets provide day-to-

day support to ensure compliance with relevant regulations 

and codes. Our internal experts conduct risk assessments 

and provide approvals on all marketing, advertising, 

labelling and artwork claims. This ensures compliance with 

advertising standards and other relevant industry standards, 

including Country of Origin requirements and front of pack 

labelling schemes, such as the Health Star Rating. 

The team of experts also provide insights through 

competitor reviews and marketplace monitoring. Where 

necessary, we rely on external expertise to provide opinion 

around product classification, labelling or marketing claims. 

Any communication that targets consumers directly will 

go through a strict approval process across key functions, 

including legal. 

Our commitment 

to marketing and labelling

Goodman Fielder’s strict approach 

to product marketing and labelling

In our Wilmar Sugar business, hazardous products that 

are used as ingredients in the manufacturing of consumer 

and food service goods are labelled in accordance with 

the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and 

Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). We engage with external 

consultants to classify products and prepare safety data 

sheets in accordance with the GHS. Products that are 

sold as ingredients meet relevant requirements, including 

those of the Therapeutic Goods Administration, Australian 

Industrial Chemicals Introduction Scheme, Australia Food 

and Grocery Council and Food Standards Australia New 

Zealand, depending on the end use of the product 

Similarly, YKA product labels follow a regulatory review 

process for labelling, advertising and communications. 

Several departments including marketing, R&amp;D, product 

safety and legal ensure robust compliance with national 

product labelling standards, as well as market standards 

for new and existing products. Our in-house design 

department works alongside marketing to develop 

product design, packaging and communications. Approved 

communications are shared on a central internal platform 

to ensure consistent use by various marketing teams and 

factories. YKA also has a centralised feedback mechanism 

to address enquiries from consumers and regulators in a 

timely fashion. 

Wilmar Sugar and YKA’s approach to 

product labelling and marketing

A wide variety of consumers enjoy our products, including 

children and we take great care to ensure that our marketing 

of snacks follows the appropriate guidance, including 

New Zealand’s Children and Young People’s Advertising 

Code. We also proactively participate and provide inputs 

into legislative development and seek to build strong 

government and industry body relationships. 

As part of our efforts to promote sustainable packaging, 

Goodman Fielder uses on-pack labelling to explain 

packaging recycling options for consumers. We track the 

adoption of these labels to maximise the recycling rate 

of our products. As of end 2020, more than 90% of our 

packaging has adopted these labels in Australia. Our goal 

is to reach 100% adoption in Australia and New Zealand 

by 2025. For more details, see the Sustainable Packaging 

section of this report.

In 2020, there were no incidents and Wilmar did not incur 

any fines related to non-compliance with industry codes or 

regulatory requirements on product labelling or marketing, 

including marketing to children. 

Going forward, we will continue to comply with relevant 

regulations and industry codes to ensure we meet  

the highest standards of responsible product marketing 

and labelling.

Sustainability Report 2020  |  Wilmar International Limited 

As part of our commitment to sustainability and to meet the growing 

demand for sustainable and certified palm oil and sugar products, 

we actively work towards obtaining relevant industry certifications. 

For palm oil, these include the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil 

(RSPO), the Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO), the Malaysian 

Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) and the International Sustainability and 

Carbon Certification (ISCC). For sugar, these include Bonsucro and the 

Smartcane Best Management Practices (BMP). Details on our progress 

towards obtaining these certifications can be found in the Summary 

of Progress and Base data section of this report.

As an active member of RSPO, we are committed 

to the RSPO certification process and have 

developed a time-bound plan to have all our mills 

and their supply bases certified against the RSPO 

Principles &amp; Criteria (P&amp;C). More information 

about our progress on RSPO certification can be 

found on the RSPO website.

We also support scheme and independent 

smallholders in our supply chain by including them 

in our certification efforts. For more information 

on how we work with smallholders and their 

certification status, see the section on Supporting 

Oil Palm Smallholder Farmers.

The Government of Indonesia under the Ministry 

of Agriculture introduced the ISPO certification 

in 2011. The ISPO is a mandatory certification 

programme for all oil palm growers and millers 

operating in Indonesia, with the objective to 

address social and environmental issues in the oil 

palm industry and improve the competitiveness of 

Indonesian palm oil in the global market. Wilmar 

began implementing the ISPO certification at 

our Indonesia operations in 2013. Currently 10 

Wilmar palm oil mills and plantations, as well as 

four independent mills are certified.

Product quality 

and safety

Customers and consumers rely on us to provide them with 

high-quality and safe products. Whether for consumer or 

industrial use, we are committed to the highest standards 

of product quality and safety at every touchpoint of the 

value chain - from design to sourcing, production, storage 

and distribution. Adopting a holistic approach to quality 

and safety is essential to curbing any health risks and 

preventing harm to our customers and consumers.

For our food products, we have three key policies. Wilmar’s 

Food Safety Policy describes our commitment and 

implementation of food safety requirements. Our Food 

Fraud Policy sets out our process for protecting our supply 

chain against deliberate and unintentional adulteration 

in our food products, food ingredients and food product 

packaging. Our Food Defence Policy protects our products 

and supply chain from malicious attacks that might affect 

the safety of our food products, food ingredients and 

food packaging. 

Wilmar requires all of our food factories to be certified 

by a food safety certification scheme accredited by the 

Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). The majority of our 

factories have been certified to the FSSC 22000 Scheme, 

while a few others to the British Retail Consortium (BRC) 

Global Standard for Food Safety. Factories in the US follow 

the SQF scheme. 

We complement our approach to certification by following 

the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), a system to 

ensure that products meet food safety, quality and legal 

requirements. We engage AIB International, a technology 

and information transfer centre for bakers and food 

processors, to conduct good manufacturing practices 

inspections in line with the GMP.

All manufacturing facilities with products that go directly to 

consumers are enrolled in our AIB inspection programme.  

In 2020, the programme was expanded to all of our facilities 

producing food and food ingredients that do not go  

directly to consumers. In 2021, we will expand this 

programme to also cover our feedmills and oil seed 

crushing plants which supply their by-product to customers 

with GMP+ requirement. 

Our policies for ensuring 

food product safety

For non-food products, we also adopt a number of 

certification schemes. These are often in line with customer 

requirements such as ISO 22716:2007 for cosmetic 

products. All of our cosmetic, cosmetic ingredients, 

pharmaceutical excipient and active factories also undergo 

AIB inspections. To ensure that we meet the standards set 

by the different certification schemes, we are also adopting 

our internal GMP approach for our oleochemical factories, 

including soaps and detergents. 

Due to COVID-19, AIB was able to conduct inspections at 

113 of the 164 factories that were originally planned for 

2020, mostly in China. Of the remaining ones, we prioritised 

six factories that were not inspected in 2019 for remote 

audits by our internal Quality Assurance and Quality Control 

(QAQC) team. The remaining 45 factories had been audited 

in 2019 and were closely monitored by our QAQC heads 

in 2020. In 2021, if the COVID-19 situation permits, we 

plan to audit 195 factories. 

For our animal feed products, we also adopt relevant 

product safety management systems, with the majority 

following the GMP+ certification scheme. Currently, the 

majority of our GMP+ certified feed production plants are 

located in ASEAN countries. We are looking to introduce 

GMP+ inspections for our feedmills in China in 2022. In 

Africa, we are planning to certify palm fatty acid distillate 

(PFAD) productions in Ghana and Ivory Coast as feed 

products once the COVID-19 situation allows.*

* PFAD is a processing residue derived from the refining of food-grade palm oil for 

the food and chemical industry uses

Wilmar’s 

approach to managing 

Genetically Modified 

Organism (GMOs)

WHAT ARE GMOS AND GM CROPS?

WHY ARE GM CROPS PRODUCED?



142

143

Sustainability Report 2020  |  Wilmar International Limited 

Sustainability Report 2020  |  Wilmar International Limited 

In simple terms, GMOs are organisms (plants, animals 

or microorganisms) that have had their genetic code (or 

DNA) altered in some way that does not occur naturally. It 

is different from conventional breeding, which involves the 

mixing of all the genes from two different sources, in that

it allows selected individual genes to be transferred from 

one organism into another and also between non-related 

species. Crops produced from or using GMOs are often 

referred to as GM crops. Widely grown GM crops include 

corn, soybeans, rapeseed and sugar beets.

One of the objectives for developing GM crops is to 

improve their protection, for example, by making them 

more resistant to pests, more tolerant to herbicides and 

more resilient against diseases. Proponents of GM crops 

believe that they have an important role to play in increasing 

food production to feed a growing population.

ARE GMO CROPS AND INGREDIENTS SAFE?

Regulatory agencies around the world, including the 

U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. 

Department of Agriculture (USDA), the European Food 

Safety Authority (EFSA) and Food Standards Australia 

New Zealand (FSANZ) have concluded that authorised 

GM crops and food ingredients produced from them are 

safe for human consumption.

WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER 

CONCERNS RELATED TO GMOS?

Other concerns with GM crops are related to the following: 

the introduction of engineered genes into wild population 

and the impact this could have on biodiversity; the marketing 

and labelling of products containing GMOs; the potential 

dependency of smallholder farmers on large seed companies 

and their ability to compete in a global market.

DOES WILMAR PRODUCE OR USE GM CROPS?

We do not grow or produce GM crops and do not use 

GMOs in our palm and sugar production process. We 

recognise that consumer views on the acceptance of GMOs, 

as well as the global regulatory landscape – in terms of 

the authorisation of GM crops as well as the provision of 

information to the consumer – will differ across geographies. 

Our approach to the use of genetically modified ingredients 

will vary across our different businesses and product lines.

For example, Goodman Fielder’s policy is to avoid 

genetically modified ingredients wherever possible and 

we do not use genetically modified ingredients in any of 

our retail branded consumer product. On the other hand, 

it is getting increasingly difficult to source ingredients 

that are unequivocally guaranteed to be GM free. YKA, 

who relies on imported genetically modified soybeans 

and rapeseeds for processing, will be handling GM crops.

HOW DOES WILMAR ENSURE  

THE RESPONSIBLE USE OF GMOS?

Where we do use GM crops, we ensure a comprehensive 

management system is in place across our value chain. We 

strictly adhere to regulatory requirements. For example, 

in China, we follow all the relevant regulations regarding 

GMO including the Regulations on the Safety Management 

of Agricultural GMOs (农业转基因生物安全管理条例), 

Measures for the Administration of Imports of Agricultural 

GMOs (农业转基因生物进口管理办法), Measures for the 

Administration of Agricultural GMOs Identification (农业

Our key focus going forward is to continue the expansion 

of our GMP programme in partnerships with AIB. We plan 

to conduct inspections, including unannounced ones, to 

ensure our product quality and safety systems are truly 

embedded in our everyday operations. In China alone, 94% 

of our factories are in the pipeline for a GMP inspection 

by AIB. 

We also aim to conduct more in-depth risk assessments. In 

2021, we will expand our Hazard Analysis Critical Control 

Points (HACCP), especially for retail products, to include 

chemical and biological hazards in countries where this is 

still voluntary to control. While these hazards are highly 

regulated in certain countries, it is important to ensure that 

all of our factories implement the same stringent processes 

to prevent these hazards, regardless of location. This is 

also in line with the latest requirements for food safety 

certification schemes and the Food and Drug Administration 

(FDA) requirements in the USA.

There were no incidences of non-compliance with 

regulations or voluntary codes concerning the health and 

safety impacts of our products, including the impact of our 

products on children's health and safety. 

We strive to maintain zero food safety related incidents 

across the entire business. To do this, we will continue 

to ensure that all of our factories are certified by a food 

safety certification scheme accredited by the GFSI. We 

also have a target to pass all AIB inspections without any 

serious findings. 

While regulatory compliance is a critical element within 

our systems, continuous improvement of food safety is the 

priority, also forming an important part of our R&amp;D efforts.

At a group level, our Supplier Guidelines outline the basic 

principles we expect all our suppliers to uphold. They cover 

topics including legal compliance and business integrity; 

labour and human rights; environmental protection; product 

quality and safety; and reporting violations or misconducts. 

In turn, suppliers are also expected to demonstrate, 

communicate and implement the principles within our 

Supplier Guidelines throughout their supply chains at all 

times. 

We have an extensive responsible sourcing programme. 

As a company with strong roots in growing oil palm and 

sugarcane, our focus on the ground has been on the 

responsible sourcing of these two commodities as key 

segments within our business.

52.5% of our total fresh fruit bunches (FFB) supply for 

Wilmar palm oil mills comes from third-party supplier 

plantations in Indonesia, Malaysia, Ghana and Nigeria. 

Of our crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel oil (PKO)

Our key programmes in ensuring palm supplier compliance

1. SATELLITE MONITORING

2. SUPPLIER COMPLIANCE

To meet our commitment to be 100% deforestation-free, 

Wilmar is taking a three-pronged approach to monitoring 

our entire supply chain:

As part of our endeavour to ensure that sustainability is 

integrated into all relevant business processes, including 

the supply chain, we conduct a due diligence process for 

new suppliers. Existing suppliers are subjected to supplier 

assessments, where relevant and necessary.

In December 2013, we launched our Supplier Group 

Compliance Programme (SGCP). Delivered by 

Earthqualizer (formerly Aidenvironment Asia), SGCP 

helps us to identify deforestation through proactive 

monitoring of all concession areas within a supplier group. 

It provides deforestation and fire alerts linked directly to the 

concessions and companies responsible for them, enabling 

us to confirm and act upon non-compliance occurring 

within our supply chain. Once an alert is received, the 

grievance process is triggered. As of end December 2020, 

the programme monitors more than 20 million hectares#, 

which covers over 500 parent groups, representing more 

than 3,000 plantation units, spanning across Malaysia, 

Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Cambodia, Myanmar and 

Thailand.

In addition to the SGCP, in October 2019, Wilmar joined 

nine other palm oil producers and buyers to support and 

fund the development of a new, publicly available, radar-

based forest monitoring system known as Radar Alerts 

for Detecting Deforestation (RADD).

SGCP forms part of our supplier compliance verification 

framework and is complemented by our Supplier Reporting 

Tool (SRT) and Grievance Mechanism.

Our NDPE policy applies to all third-party suppliers at 

group level, with no exceptions. In an industry first, we 

have also made the complete list of our supplying mills 

available on our Sustainability Dashboard since 2015. To 

date, we have completed formal engagements with 100% 

of our group-level palm oil suppliers.

In 2017, Wilmar developed and launched the Supplier 

Reporting Tool (SRT) to better assess our suppliers’ progress 

and their implementation of our NDPE policy. SRT is used to 

assess suppliers for environmental and social risks, including 

human rights.

The SRT is an annual programme conducted with 100% of 

Wilmar’s direct supplying mills (including Wilmar mills) and 

their associated estates. Risk assessment procedures involve 

analysis of SRT data in combination with mills’ certification 

status, grievances and the Consortium of Resource Experts’ 

(CORE’s) neighbourhood geospatial risk analysis. Those 

categorised with higher levels of risk or ‘high-priority’ mills, 

undergo site assessments and direct engagement as part 

of our NDPE policy implementation programmes.

Site assessments are carried out with the help of a digital 

mobile audit tool called Nimbly. Nimbly generates 

automated reports with time-bound action plans for the 

supplier mills and plantations assessed. The tool ensures 

that our suppliers receive assessment results and feedback 

with minimal lag time.

Sustainability Report 2020  |  Wilmar International Limited 

Sustainability Report 2020  |  Wilmar International Limited 

Our SRT allows us to collate reports on specific NDPE 

related criteria as reported by each supplier mill. Based 

on these reports, we can then identify potential risks of 

our direct mill suppliers. The criteria that are reported on 

includes the areas indicated by the icons above.

Since its launch in 2017, SRT has been rolled out to our 

suppliers in Indonesia, Malaysia, Honduras, Guatemala 

and Colombia. Out of our 919 suppliers, 574 completed 

SRTs were submitted as of December 2020. This accounts 

for 62.5% of the supply base, an increase from the 52.3% 

reported in 2019.  We expect to further improve our SRT 

response rate in 2021, specifically targeting suppliers who 

have yet to participate. In view of the current pandemic 

situation, which has limited our team’s ability to conduct 

site assessments and verify SRT responses, we are exploring 

alternative solutions for remote assessments and virtual 

training sessions. This is likely to be informed by the 2020 

SRT results and rolled out in the first half of 2021.

For our palm oil operations in particular, traceability is 

an important first step towards achieving supply chain 

transformation. It allows us to map our supply base back 

to palm oil mills and eventually to plantations. With this 

information, we evaluate suppliers’ performance against 

our NDPE policy, identify and assess high-risk suppliers 

and engage with them to drive continuous improvement. 

Traceability 

traceability to plantation for all Wilmar palm oil mills across 

our global operations based on the set criteria. 

Wilmar has no timeline to attain full traceability to plantation 

level as this primarily serves the purpose of delivering 100% 

segregated sustainable supply – which can also mean the 

exclusion of vulnerable producers, such as smallholders. 

We believe it makes more sense to invest resources to 

raise the floor for sustainability and good practice for all 

suppliers within a mill's supply base. 

Amongst Wilmar suppliers, there is still a low-level of 

willingness from many mills to share any information on 

their FFB suppliers, despite general support on the notion 

of traceability. Anti-competition regulations are often cited 

and this can be an issue. We believe that fundamentally 

a culture change is required in mills. In view of availability 

of very limited information, Wilmar does not publish nor 

share information on plantation data. As for Wilmar-owned 

concession maps, we have been sharing them publicly 

since 2014 through the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil 

(RSPO) on the Global Forest Watch (GFW) map platform.

Ultimately, this exercise will provide the level of transparency 

that is expected by our customers and help to provide 

visibility on our product sources. We update our supplier 

information bi-annually on our Sustainability Dashboard, 

under the supply chain map section to provide transparent 

information to all stakeholders in a timely manner. 

Wilmar first set out to achieve full palm oil mill traceability 

for all volumes handled by our refineries by 2015. Due 

to challenges in commodity transportation and trading 

structures in certain markets, we have revised our target to 

2022. We have put in place additional processes to ensure 

we meet our target. For example, we request traceability 

information for volumes received from our third-party 

refiners/traders/bulkers - this is considered a self-declaration 

document. Wilmar's sustainability team continually monitors 

the lists obtained from suppliers to ensure that there is no 

breach in relation to our NDPE Policy. Our procurement 

practices also now involve buying largely from sources that 

are able to provide visibility of origin. As of December 2020, 

we are on track to meet our target, with 97.7%# of CPO 

and PKO equivalent traceable to mill level. This translates 

to about 23.9 million tonnes of palm products traceable 

to mills across our global operations.

Overall, 20% of our global supply chain is traceable to 

plantation. As of December 2020, approximately 14% of 

third-party supplying mills within our global supply chain 

are traceable to plantation level. We have achieved 100%

3. GRIEVANCE MECHANISM

Our Grievance Procedure provides an avenue for 

stakeholders to raise concerns against Wilmar and our 

third-party suppliers. It helps us to monitor compliance on 

our NDPE policy across our operations and supply chain 

and holds us accountable through increased transparency 

by providing stakeholders with access to timely and public 

updates on grievances. Wilmar continuously aims to 

achieve a 100% response rate for all grievances raised 

and works towards resolving all open cases effectively and 

transparently. Our grievance list is updated on an on-going 

basis and is available on our Sustainability Dashboard. 

Wilmar implements a ‘suspend first’ approach for suppliers. 

Effective 1 January 2019, suppliers involved in verified cases 

of deforestation and/or new development on peatland 

face immediate suspension at group-level. To avoid any 

suspension contributing to a growing unsustainable market 

or negatively impacting oil palm smallholders, Wilmar 

sees post-suspension engagement as crucial, enabling 

us to assist suppliers in bringing their operations to 

compliance. Through corrective measures and action, 

suspended suppliers can re-enter our supply chain. To 

guide suppliers on the lifting of suspension, we published 

our supplier re-entry criteria in 2019. This re-entry criteria 

guides our suspended suppliers on our required actions and 

expectations for our consideration in lifting suspensions.

One of the biggest challenges in creating a deforestation-

free palm oil supply chain is the lack of industry-wide 

alignment on approaches to addressing deforestation in 

the supply chain. Disparities include deforestation cut-off 

dates, how suspensions are carried out and the scope of 

suspensions for non-compliant suppliers. For example, no 

other company has adopted a ‘suspend first’ approach, so 

some plantation companies are still actively and knowingly 

conducting deforestation. These companies will only 

stop their deforestation activities if they are exposed and 

identified by external stakeholders. 

Despite improvements in the transparency of supply 

chain activities and initiatives, there is still a need 

to measure and communicate NDPE progress more 

effectively to suppliers and stakeholders. To this end, 

Wilmar became an active member of the Proforest-led 

NDPE IRF in 2019.

The tool involves the assessment and categorisation of 

supplier mills, evaluating their performance in relation to 

the three central pillars of our policy: Deforestation, Peat 

and Exploitation. This categorisation involves obtaining 

a wide range of data: certification status and grievances; 

sourcing information; progress on own plantations;  

and third-party supply, monitoring and verification 

systems. Data collection for the NDPE IRF is  

supported by the SRT.

We have found the NDPE IRF to be a highly effective 

tool for understanding performance across our whole 

production base. It is helping Wilmar to report more 

broadly on progress with NDPE implementation, while 

providing detailed information that can serve as a basis 

for affirmative action on the ground.

DELIVERING NDPE COMMITMENTS - 

NDPE IMPLEMENTATION REPORTING FRAMEWORK (NDPE IRF)

Progress of Deforestation-Free by Volumes 

(based on IRF reporting categories)

Wilmar continuously aims to 

achieve a 100% response rate for all 

grievances raised and works towards 

resolving all open cases effectively 

and transparently.







An important element of our re-entry 

criteria is that we require supplier groups 

with non-compliant forest clearing and peat 

development (after the cut-off date of  

31 December 2015) to submit recovery 

plans to address issues on these past  

non-compliance(s). 

In 2019, through a group process convened 

by the Mighty Earth, Wilmar worked 

with other palm oil companies and non-

governmental organisations (NGOs) to 

define such criteria. Although the working 

group could not agree on the adoption of 

all the criteria due to different stakeholder 

expectations, Wilmar has adopted the 

undisputed portion of the re-entry criteria. 

Wilmar’s recovery plans are guided by four 

basic criteria: 

1. 

Additionality; 

2. 

Long-lasting; 

3. 

Equitable; 

4. 

Knowledge-based. 

Non-compliant forest clearing and peat 

development leads to negative biodiversity 

impact. Therefore, we value recovery plans 

that can create long term conservation 

outcomes and enhance biodiversity and 

ecological functions of the proposed sites.

GRIEVANCE CASES AS OF DECEMBER 2020

75  

grievance  

cases

There are also no commercial consequences to their active 

deforestation post January 2019 as long as their buyers 

do not adopt the “suspend first approach” and “re-entry 

criteria”. There were many instances where our suspended 

suppliers could easily redirect their oil into alternative 

supply chains, where there are no stringent requirements 

for re-entry. 

In addition, the scope of suspensions for non-compliant 

suppliers tends to vary from one company to another. 

Wilmar applies suspension at the group-level of supplier 

companies, while other purchasing companies may suspend 

at the mill level or apply controlled purchase approaches 

(i.e. staggered reduction of purchases over a period of 

time). This means that supplier companies found to be in 

breach of no deforestation requirements can potentially 

still find routes into NDPE supply chains.

Besides that, there is currently no industry-wide alignment 

on the definition of ‘group-level’. Wilmar adopted RSPO's 

definition for "group", while others have not aligned with 

RSPO or provided clarity on their definitions. Due to this, 

some companies tend to take a case-by-case approach in 

resolving non-compliances which leads to inconsistencies 

and dismissal of cases without much clarity.

Reflecting on the industry’s sustainability journey, significant 

progress has been made towards eliminating deforestation 

from the global palm oil supply chain. Going forward, we 

must continue to work together as an industry, building 

towards the same standards and approaches. Through the 

innovations and initiatives outlined, Wilmar continuously 

strives to advocate for a deforestation-free palm oil supply 

chain with support of key stakeholders within the industry.

Sustainability Report 2020  |  Wilmar International Limited 

Wilmar is committed to upholding a high standard of 

corporate governance to safeguard the interests of all our 

stakeholders and continue to create long term value for 

them. To establish an appropriate governance structure, 

controls and oversight of our business is essential. This 

ensure that responsible business practices are upheld 

and the right culture is instilled. In addition, we recognise 

the importance of a diverse Board, comprising Directors 

who bring an appropriate balance and diversity in skills, 

experience, gender and relevant industry knowledge. 

Guided by our Board Diversity Policy, our Directors are 

selected from a wide range of backgrounds with diverse 

skills, qualification and relevant experience. More details 

on our corporate governance framework, practices and 

Directors’ profiles can be found on pages 38 and 50 of 

our Annual Report 2020.





WILMAR’S CODE OF ETHICS  

prescribes the moral and ethical 

standards expected of our employees 

and leadership. Underlying our Code 

of Ethics is the principle of integrity, 

which is to be applied in all of our 

behaviours and relationships. 



ANTI FRAUD POLICY

We have a specific Anti-Fraud Policy 

that sets out guidelines and assigns 

responsibilities for the development 

of controls, and for conducting 

investigations related to fraud. 



TAX POLICY

With regards to tax, Wilmar's Tax 

Policy sets the direction on how all 

companies within the Group are to 

conduct our tax affairs. Our approach 

is based on key principles to ensure 

that we manage tax in a fair and 

responsible manner.



WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY

Our Whistleblowing Policy provides 

employees and external parties who 

have a business relationship with 

Wilmar, with accessible channels 

to raise concerns about possible 

corporate improprieties. This can be 

done in confidence and without the 

risk of reprisal. It also sets out the 

process to investigate concerns raised 

and determining appropriate follow- 

up actions. 





WILMAR’S CODE OF CONDUCT  

sets out the acceptable standards 

of conduct and personal behaviours 

that all employees are expected 

to maintain. It addresses concerns 

on conflict of interest, bribery and 

corruption. The Code of Conduct is 

centred around three key principles: 

1. 

To avoid conflict of interest; 

2. 

To avoid misuse and/or abuse of 

position; 

3. 

To ensure confidentiality of 

information and to prevent misuse 

of information gained through the 

Company’s operations. 

SUPPLIER GUIDELINES

Our Supplier Guidelines outline the 

principles we expect our suppliers 

to uphold, including those related to 

business integrity. In turn, suppliers are 

also expected to communicate and 

implement the principles within our 

Supplier Guidelines throughout their 

supply chains.

In 2020, there were no reported 

incidents of anti-competitive 

behaviour, monopolistic practice or 

corruption cases involving Wilmar.

Group policies and guidelines

Corporate governance

102-17, 207-1

All employees at Wilmar receive training and specific 

guidance on our corporate policies, either as part of their 

on-boarding or as refresher training. Employees also have 

access to these policies which are posted on the Company’s 

intranet or website.

These corporate policies have been approved by the Board 

of Directors who set the tone from the top.  Directors are 

also encouraged to participate in seminars, conferences 

and training programmes which are relevant to their role. 

More information on the development programmes 

attended by some Directors in the course of FY2020, as 

well as in-house briefings conducted by Management and 

external consultants can be found on page 54 of our Annual  

Report 2020. 

In 2020, there were no reported incidents of anti-competitive 

behaviour, monopolistic practice or corruption cases 

involving Wilmar. There were also no significant incidents of 

non-compliance with any relevant environmental and socio-

economic laws or regulations in our operations. Wilmar also 

did not make any contributions to political campaigns or  

political organisations.

Data security 

and privacy

Wilmar places cybersecurity at the core of our digital 

transformation journey. We use a robust and risk-based 

framework to manage ever-changing cyber threats and 

proactively protect our assets. 

We constantly review our IT policies to ensure that they 

stay relevant and in compliance with prevailing data privacy 

laws and regulations in countries that we operate in.

Wilmar’s IT security team reports to our Chief Information 

Officer (CIO) who in turn reports to Wilmar’s Chief 

Operating Officer (COO). Key developments, initiatives 

and emerging issues on IT security are regularly reported 

by the CIO, after clearing with the COO, to the Board.

Protecting data privacy

Wilmar aims to ensure that we comply with all relevant 

data protection regulations, including the General Data 

Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the Personal 

Data Protection Act (PDPA) in Singapore. The Wilmar 

Group Privacy Policy, available on our website, outlines 

how we collect personal data; how and for what purposes 

we may use it; and to whom such data may be disclosed to. 

This policy also includes important information regarding 

individuals’ rights with respect to the processing of personal 

data. Wilmar’s Internal Privacy Policy addresses how 

employees must handle data in accordance with these 

regulations. Both policies were updated in 2020 and were 

communicated to all employees.

Implementing cybersecurity measures 

To prevent, detect and respond to cyber-attacks efficiently, 

we reference the National Institute of Standards and 

Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework in our IT 

Security strategy, which aims to drive productivity without 

compromising cybersecurity. We also follow industry best 

practices to reinforce our cyber resiliency, by ensuring 

high availability and recoverability of our infrastructure 

and services.

We recognise the importance of building a cyber-aware 

culture, and strive to do so by conducting interactive 

awareness trainings and sending cybersecurity bulletins 

with tips and advice regularly. This inculcates good cyber-

hygiene amongst our employees and reminds them to 

stay vigilant.

governance

Wilmar’s Sustainability Department is led by the Chief 

Sustainability Officer, with the General Manager – Group 

Sustainability in charge of day-to-day management. Staffed 

by over 60 employees across our global offices and sites, 

the Sustainability Department works in collaboration with 

all business and operational units to implement the Group’s 

multifaceted sustainability strategies and initiatives. A 

combination of local and technical expertise throughout 

Asia, Africa and Europe enables the Department to oversee 

implementation of the NDPE policy, other sustainability 

related policies, sustainability certification, supply chain 

monitoring, research &amp; development, stakeholder 

engagement and reporting.

A Technical Advisory Group comprising external 

sustainability partners (e.g. sustainability consultants, 

collaborators and civil society organisations) work with 

our Sustainability team to provide on-the-ground support 

to execute and evaluate the implementation of our NDPE 

and other sustainability-related policies.

Materiality

In line with our increased scope of reporting, we have 

carried out a comprehensive materiality assessment in 2020 

to cover our key business segments. This exercise aimed 

to identify the ESG topics that matter most to stakeholders 

and are most important for the long term success of Wilmar 

as a group.

We engaged an independent consultancy specialising in 

sustainability to conduct our 2020 assessment. We followed 

the principle of materiality as set out in the GRI Standards, 

undertaking a four-stage approach:

102-47

Undertook desk-based research and 

a benchmarking exercise to identify 

a list of potentially material topics 

for our key business segments. This 

stage produced a list of 16 topics that 

were taken forward for prioritisation, 

filtering out those that were not 

relevant to our business.

Conducted an online survey for internal and 

external stakeholders to prioritise the list of 16 

topics based on how important they are for Wilmar 

to address as a group. We aimed to get balanced 

views from representatives of our most important 

stakeholder groups, namely Wilmar’s employees 

from across different departments, academia, 

banks/lenders, certification bodies, customers, 

government/regulators, industry bodies, investors/

shareholders, labour unions, local communities, 

media, multi-stakeholder organisations, civil society 

organisation (CSOs), non-profit organisations, retailers, 

smallholders, suppliers, sustainability consultants/

collaborators, third-party auditors. We received a 

total of 364 responses from our employees and 521 

responses from external stakeholders, enabling us to 

achieve a response rate of 66.5% and 42% respectively.

Conducted a series of interviews 

with key external stakeholders 

to gather additional context 

and insights into Wilmar’s 

sustainability context and 

material topics.

Consolidated and analysed findings from the online 

survey and interviews to produce a preliminary matrix. 

Validated the results with the Sustainability Team and 

received sign-off from the Board of Directors.

Procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement 

vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than 

for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, 

the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance 

engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that 

would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance 

engagement been performed. Our procedures were 

Description of procedures performed 

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the 

presentation of the Subject Matter Information based on 

the evidence we have obtained.  

We conducted our engagement in accordance with the 

International Standard for Assurance Engagements Other 

Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information 

(‘ISAE 3000’) and the terms of reference for this engagement 

as agreed with Wilmar on 4th December 2019 and our 

addendum dated 15th December 2020. Those standards 

require that we plan and perform our engagement to 

obtain limited assurance about whether, in all material 

respects, the Subject Matter is presented in accordance 

with the Criteria, and to issue a report. The nature, timing, 

and extent of the procedures selected depend on our 

judgment, including an assessment of the risk of material 

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. We believe 

that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate 

to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusions. 

Our review was limited to the information on the select 

indicators set out within the Report from 01 January 2020 to 

31 December 2020 and our responsibility does not include:  

• 

Any work in respect of sustainability information 

published elsewhere in Wilmar’s annual report, website 

and other publications, 

• 

Sustainability information prior to 01 January 2020 

and subsequent to 31 December 2020, and 

• 

Management’s forward-looking statements such as 

targets, plans and intentions. 

We have complied with the independence and other 

ethical requirements of the Accounting and Corporate 

Regulatory Authority (ACRA) Code of Professional Conduct 

and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities 

(ACRA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles 

of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due 

care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. 

Our firm applies Singapore Standards on Quality Control 

1 of the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants and, 

accordingly, maintains a comprehensive system of quality 

control including documented policies and procedures 

regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional 

standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 

We have the required competencies and experience  

to conduct this assurance engagement. Our professionals 

have experience in both assurance skills and in the  

applicable subject matter including environmental, social 

and financial aspects.

of the Subject Matter Information 

based on the evidence we have 

obtained.

designed to obtain a limited level of assurance on  

which to base our conclusion and do not provide all the 

evidence that would be required to provide a reasonable 

level of assurance.

Although we considered the effectiveness of management’s 

internal controls when determining the nature and extent 

of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not 

designed to provide assurance on internal controls. Our 

procedures did not include testing controls or performing 

procedures relating to checking aggregation or calculation 

of data within IT systems. 

A limited assurance engagement consists of making 

enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for preparing 

the Subject Matter Information and related information, 

and applying analytical and other appropriate procedures. 

Our procedures included: 

1. 

Inquiries with Wilmar’s Sustainability team to:

• 

Understand principal business operations, 

• 

Appreciate key sustainability issues 

and developments,

• 

Map out information flow for sustainability 

reporting and the relevant controls,

• 

Identify data providers with their 

responsibilities, and 

• 

Recognise the likelihood of possible 

manipulation of sustainability information 

and data.

2. 

Virtual interviews with and sought clarifications from 

employees and Management in Singapore, Indonesia, 

Malaysia, Ghana and Nigeria (e.g. Sustainability 

team, Human Resource team, Estate Managers, Mill 

Managers) to understand key sustainability issues 

related to the selected indicators, collection processes 

and accuracy of reporting. 

3. 

Conducting of process walk-through of systems and 

processes for data aggregation and reporting with 

relevant personnel to understand the quality of checks 

and control mechanisms, and assess and test the 

controls in relation to the concerned subject matters. 

4. 

Performing of analytical reviews on data and inquire 

with relevant personnel when anomalies are observed.

5. 

Obtaining of documentation through sampling 

methods to verify assumptions, estimations and 

computations made by Management in relation to 

the concerned subject matters.

Based on our procedures and the evidence obtained, we 

are not aware of any material modifications that should 

be made to the Subject Matter Information as of 14 May 

2021 for the year ended 31 December 2020, in order for 

it to be in accordance with the Criteria.

Conclusion

6. 

Checking data and statements had been correctly 

transcribed from corporate systems and / or 

supporting evidence, in relation to concerned  

subject matters. 

7.

External assurance  

from Control Union Certifications

Control Union Certifications was commissioned by Wilmar 

to conduct an independent assurance of traceability 

data and NDPE Implementation Reporting Framework 

disclosures. The scope of this assurance covers palm oil 

and lauric. 

The traceability information in the Sustainability Report 

is the exclusive responsibility of Wilmar. Control Union 

Certifications was not involved in the preparation of any 

material included in this document. 

The responsibility of Control Union is to express an opinion 

concerning the statements included in the Report regarding 

traceability to mill data and NDPE Implementation 

Reporting Framework disclosures, within the assurance 

scope mentioned below, with the purpose to inform all 

the Interested Parties. 

The assurance engagement has been planned and performed in accordance with AA1000AS v3. 

The  assurance process involves verification of the following aspects: 

INCLUSIVITY 

Engagement with stakeholders in the report development 

process and their involvement in organisational decision making.

Wilmar has formed partnerships where they collaborate 

with stakeholders in the industry on issues of traceability 

and NDPE-IRF. Wilmar’s broader stakeholder engagement 

is dependent on the stakeholder group. That is, depending 

on the type of stakeholder group they are in talks with, 

stakeholder engagements include regular meetings, 

whistleblowing and grievances processes. 

Assurance scope

Control Union Certifications is accredited according to 

ISO 17021-1:2015/ISO 17065:2012 covering our global 

scope and operations. This includes the need to maintain 

a comprehensive system of quality control including 

documented policies and procedures on compliance 

to ethical and legal requirements as well as  objectivity 

throughout our operations. The auditors performing the 

data check have proven track records in the review of similar 

assignments and qualified according to industry leading 

third party certification programmes of the palm sector.

Independence and quality control

The level of Assurance is used to determine the depth of 

detail that an assurance provider uses to identify if there 

are material errors, omissions or misstatements. The level 

of assurance for this report is moderate. 

Level of assurance

Based on our moderate process, nothing has come to 

our attention that causes us to believe that the scope as 

detailed above and presented in the report is not presented 

fairly in accordance with the criteria. 

Hence, our work confirms that the information on the above 

mentioned traceability data and NDPE Implementation 

Reporting Framework disclosures are reliable and objective 

and are presented clearly and understandably. 

Conclusion

• 

Review of internal and external documentary 

evidence presented by Wilmar 

• 

Review of approach to data collection at  

company level 

• 

Audit of data presented in the Report including  

a detailed review of a sample of data

• 

Review of a selection of internal  

performance documents 

• 

Interviews of personnel within relevant divisions 

responsible for management of the two 

programmes in the report (IRF and traceability) 

Methodology 

JON HEINRICHS 

PROGRAM MANAGER 

12 APRIL 2021

MATERIALITY 

Identification of issues in the report that are relevant and 

significant to the organisation’s stakeholders, the presence 

of and the extent to which these material issues are disclosed 

in the report.

Traceability is a prerequisite to implement sustainability 

programmes within the supply chain. Thus, within the 

scope of this review, traceability has been identified as a 

relevant material topic. As a result, Wilmar International 

has a policy in place that addresses traceability and NDPE. 

NDPE responds to the needs of the industry and mitigate 

risks on no-deforestation and peat conversion. 

IMPACT

Monitoring, measurement and providing accountability for 

how the actions of the organisation affect the economy, the 

environment, society, stakeholders or the organisation itself.

Currently, Wilmar’s Traceability to Mill (TTM) volume is 

97.7% of the total volume. This result is aggregated from 

the 63 refineries that supplied palm oil and lauric in 2020. 

Also, 89.5% of palm oil and lauric volumes to Wilmar´s 

origin refineries in Malaysia and Indonesia are from suppliers 

that have at least company group level commitments and/

or action plans in place to address the No Deforestation 

requirements. This volume percentage is an aggregated 

value from 23 Wilmar own refineries. 

RESPONSIVENESS

Acting on stakeholder issues and provision of feedback through 

decisions, actions, performance and communication.

Wilmar publishes the outcomes of stakeholder 

engagements on the company’s website, to publicly share 

the achievements of this process. Additionally, feedback 

from stakeholder engagement is addressed through a 

number of channels such as the grievance procedure.
