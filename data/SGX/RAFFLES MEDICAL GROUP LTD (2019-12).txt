Statement from Executive Chairman (102-14)



In the last four decades, we have been steadfast in 

our determination to bring quality and compassionate 

healthcare to more people around the world. Our desire 

to create long-term shared value for our stakeholders 

has guided us to drive operational excellence within the 

organisation through sustainable growth.

As Raffles Medical Group continues to expand in Asia, we 

have scaled up sustainability efforts across our various 

businesses and functions within the Group. We continue 

to leverage one another’s strengths and resources, 

so as to seed the agenda of sustainability within our 

organisation. Together with the board of directors and 

senior management, the Group has set targets that help 

us play an even more active role in each strategic area 

towards this journey of sustainable excellence. 

We stay committed to building an environment that is 

patient-centric, energy efficient and safe for our patients, 

employees, and our community. Through this report, I 

am pleased to share key highlights of 2019, in the four 

focused pillars of Customers, Environment, Employees 

and Marketplace. I trust that this report will provide insights 

to demonstrate some of the good progress we have made.




7

Partnering Our Customers

We endeavour to be a “Trusted Partner for Health”, and 

continuously strive to deliver best outcomes and enhanced 

value to our patients, customers and the community.

At RMG, we have built a patient-centric environment that is 

safe and holistic for rest and healing. The functional design 

in our facilities and work processes are moulded around 

the needs of our patients. Our group practice model allows 

patients to experience quality healthcare that is integrated 

and seamless.

We have also made significant progress in how we engage 

with our customers and provide them with improved 

experiences through innovation and the strategic use of 

technology. On our integrated digital healthcare platform, 

Raffles Connect, we launched eQueue, which is a system 

that allows patients to obtain a queue number before 

arriving at their preferred Raffles Medical clinic. This means 

they spend less time in the waiting room, and they have 

time saved to focus on their critical activities. This digital 

platform delivers a seamless experience that is conveniently 

available to our customers on their smartphones. It has also 

fostered change in how our employees work, resulting in 

more optimal use of our resources and opened up new 

markets for us.

Beyond Singapore, our global footprint continues to grow 

with the opening of Raffles Hospital Chongqing in January 

2019. It has allowed us to bring trusted and quality 

healthcare to benefit more people in the region. With our 

second international hospital in Shanghai slated to open in 

2020, we look to provide quality evidence-based medical 

services to Shanghai’s local residents, foreigners and 

international patients.

Partnering Our Employees

Our people are our asset and they form an important part 

of the Group. As an employer, we continue to be focused 

on developing their careers, taking care of their general 

well-being, and creating a safe and engaging working 

environment for our employees.

Key highlights in this critical pillar include conducting a 

Total Workplace Safety and Health (Total WSH) survey 

to assess our employee’s perception of safety. From 

the survey results, we have introduced new initiatives to 

improve safety and health practices for everyone.

In the year, the Group also underwent stringent audits such 

as bizSAFE level 3 certification to ensure no stones are 

left unturned in our efforts to address all risk and hazards 

in the workplace. 

For our employees’ holistic well-being, RMG and the Health 

Promotion Board jointly introduced a Healthy Workplace 

Ecosystem at the Raffles Specialist Centre to encourage 

all employees to participate in a range of activities from 

physical workout sessions to healthy-cooking classes.

Preserving the Environment

We continue to look for innovative ways to do our part 

for the environment by minimising wastage and reducing 

our environmental footprint and energy cost. We have 

progressively implemented new initiatives to use energy 

more efficiently and reduce electricity consumption for the 

next three years.

 

Some efforts on this front have definitely paid off - our 

recycling programme showed an improvement of 62 per 

cent in recycling tonnage compared to 2018. 

Partnering Our Community

To truly achieve sustainable excellence, we believe in 

giving back to the community we operate in. In 2019, RMG 

planned a series of corporate social responsibility outreach 

programmes such as helping the Foodbank provide food 

to the less fortunate, and bringing good cheer to seniors 

during the festive seasons. Our joint-government initiatives 

– Emergency Care Collaboration, Enhanced Screen for 

Life and Primary Care Network, have allowed us to treat 

eligible patients on our premises at subsidised rates. 

These partnerships allow us to play a meaningful role in 

providing critical healthcare services that are needed by 

the public living in our community.

Looking Ahead

We could not have grown responsibly from our humble 

beginnings to become the trusted partner for healthcare 

in Singapore and the region, if sustainability has not been 

progressively weaved into our blueprint. As we move forward, 

I want to reiterate that sustainability is not only a journey, but a 

commitment. And, this commitment in achieving sustainable 

excellence, will guide us to achieve even higher levels of 

operational efficiency for decades to come.

~ Decline in CSI weighted average is due to a lower number of responses received over higher patient census in 2019. 

* New RMG policy called for direct alignment of chosen training course to area of work and resulted in higher training relevancy but       

 

lower number of trainings. 

+ Improved reporting process has facilitated the improved record-ability of incidences. 

# The focus in 2019 was building awareness of the importance of life-saving courses, leading to more road shows being held than  

   conducting actual courses.

Care Collaboration (ECC) Ward at Raffles Hospital 

in February 2019. This project was developed with 

patient-centric care as its core approach, and involves 

anticipating patient needs and providing holistic care 

and experience at every contact point. For maximum

WECARE improves patient safety, quality of nursing 

care, decreases fall incidences and increases carer-

patient satisfaction. Due to its encouraging results, we 

have implemented the WECARE initiative in more wards 

at Raffles Hospital from October 2019.

Follow-up Phone Call on Discharge

Piloted at the Surgical Ward at Raffles Hospital in July 

2019, this initiative aims to follow up on our patient’s 

general well-being within three to four days of their 

discharge. In our bid to provide holistic care for our 

patients, we proactively seek to identify post-discharge 

issues early and provide intervention assistance as

required. This initiative promotes: 

• Increased patient satisfaction 

• Building of rapport and trust with our patients 

• Additional support required for our patients by their 

caregivers 

• Reduced number of readmissions





Customer Service Excellence

In meeting national customer satisfaction levels, Raffles 

Hospital stayed true to our commitment to bring value 

to our customers through better service. We topped 

the Private Hospitals category in first position, beating 

other private hospitals in Singapore in the Customer 

Satisfaction Index of Singapore (CSISG) 2018. 

 

In March 2019, Customer Experience Management 

(CEM) launched the Patient Engagement and Coaching 

Program (PEC). It aims to help our employees to be 

more service-oriented, inculcates the importance of 

empathy and enhance their communication skills through 

coaching. The Group also implemented a completely 

paperless patient feedback system across all business 

units from January 2019. This includes the introduction of 

QR codes to access feedback channels for our inpatients 

at the wards. 

 

To further enhance customer experience for our patients, 

our CEM team also launched Service Roll Calls at all the 

specialist centres, inpatient wards, dental and business 

centres. The sessions were led by senior management 

at Raffles Hospital to emphasise service excellence to 

our customers, and acknowledge employees who have 

received compliments from patients for good services 

rendered.

Emergency Care Collaboration

Raffles Hospital is the first and only private hospital in 

Singapore to take in subsidised care patients brought 

in by SCDF ambulances through the Emergency Care 

Collaboration (ECC) scheme with the MOH. Since 

June 2015, the hospital has attended to and treated 

many patients who pay subsidised rates. In this way, 

RMG contributes to the national effort in ensuring that 

Singaporeans receive the needed care in a timely manner. 

As the collaboration has proven fruitful, MOH signed a 

five-year extension with Raffles Hospital in June 2017. 

To assist with bed crunch situation at public hospitals, 

Raffles Hospital also collaborated with KTPH, TTSH and 

CGH for ECC transfer cases to help ease inpatient cases 

in public hospitals.

Trauma Accredited Hospital

Raffles Hospital was accredited and certified as a 

trauma hospital by the National Trauma Committee, 

Singapore in June 2018. We are the first private 

hospital in Singapore to receive this accreditation. 

Our 24-hour Accident &amp; Emergency department is 

equipped and ready to receive trauma patients and 

medical emergencies at any time. Supported by more 

than 100 specialists in Raffles Hospital, we tend to both 

private patients as well as patients brought in by SCDF 

ambulances through the Emergency Care Collaboration 

scheme with MOH. 

Ensuring Quality Outcomes

RMG closely monitors patient safety indicators to gain 

insights and understanding of actual / potential issues. 

In addition to the international patient safety goals as 

defined by the Joint Commission International (JCI), 

Raffles Hospital also measures clinical performance on 

these key themes: 

• Unscheduled readmission

• Hospital acquired infections

• Falls

• Medication related events

• Surgery related events

• Clinical outcome by speciality

 

These are discussed at the respective Quality 

Assurance (QA) committees to seek improvement 

measures.

Quality Promotion Platforms

• Service quality

• Inter-departmental sharing of projects and highlights 

Raffles Hospital also subscribes to the MOH clinical 

surveillance and reporting to promote transparent public 

reporting.

Access to Patient Education Materials 

&amp; Health Advisory

The Group creates and shares publicly on various 

platforms, patient education information that can be 

beneficial to patients and members of the public. These 

platforms include the corporate website, social media 

channels including Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, 

electronic direct mailers and printed brochures and 

materials. Patients are provided with relevant patient 

education information when required or requested. 

Delivering Enhanced Value 

Clinical Advancements 

In 2019, we started to establish Pharmacogenomics 

which focuses on individualising medicine to optimise 

the efficacy of a drug and/or to minimise its toxicity by 

understanding how genetic information can be used to 

predict, diagnosis and treat disease. Training of doctors, 

primarily family physicians, and building up of IT system 

capabilities and support commenced with the effort.

In another area of clinical advancement, Raffles 

Hospital launched robotic surgery in 2019. Consultant 

surgeons trained in this specialty are supported by the 

da Vinci Surgical System which is designed to facilitate 

complex surgery using minimally invasive approach. This 

technology allows our doctors to perform many types of 

complex procedures with more precision, flexibility and 

control than is possible with conventional techniques.

 

Clinical R&amp;D 

Raffles Hospital is involved in several clinical trials, 

which enable our local and overseas patients to access 

novel therapies and diagnostics. Raffles Hospital also 

supports academic and observational studies where our 

clinicians assess disease risk factors, observe the effect 

of diagnostic tests, treatments or interventions to develop 

better clinical guidelines and decision making. 

 

24/7 Healthcare Access via Digital 

Platforms 

In line with digital technology, RMG launched two 

electronic healthcare platforms to bring improved 

healthcare access to the public. Raffles Connect is a 

secured integrated digital platform where patients can 

access critical healthcare services round the clock. 

The strategic use of technology gives our patients and 

customers access to RMG’s healthcare ecosystem and 

improves patient experience. 

eQueue, which is a digital personal queue system on 

Raffles Connect, allows patients to obtain a queue 

number before arriving at their preferred Raffles Medical 

clinic. This means they spend less time in the waiting 

room, and they have time saved to focus on their critical 

activities. This digital platform delivers a seamless 

experience that is conveniently available to our customers 

on their smartphones. Upon arrival at the clinic, patient 

registration is automatic and seamless. The patient is

then notified via the smartphone, when it is time for the 

doctor’s consultation. 

24/7 video consultation is also available on Raffles Connect, 

any time, and from anywhere, with a smartphone. With 

our integrated Electronic Medical Records and patient 

care system, our doctors have access to patients’ medical 

records and information to provide seamless and continuity 

of care for our patients. If medication is required, it can be 

delivered to the doorstep of the patient. Medical certificate, 

if required, is also made available in electronic form, on 

Raffles Connect.

Other healthcare services available on this platform 

includes booking of medical appointments, accessing 

personal health records, receiving health advisories and 

purchasing health supplements. 

Another e-commerce service www.raffleshealth.com 

was launched in the year. This platform allows patients 

to purchase their health screening, vaccination, health 

supplements and other medical services online before 

they turn up at the respective medical centres. Patients 

can also easily procure Raffles health supplements on 

third-party retail platforms like Lazada.sg.

 

Digitalising Healthcare Systems &amp; Services

The Group invests substantially in IT systems to provide 

safer medical care to our patients. RMG strives to achieve 

this in a socially ethical and environmentally green way. 

Some of the IT initiatives we have implemented are as 

follows:

• To give a seamless experience to Raffles Health 

Insurance (RHI) customers when processing claims, 

Raffles Shield was launched. This is an Integrated shield 

plan powered by the Policy Administration System 

(PAS) and is a single cloud platform which administers 

the business operation process. The system is also 

integrated with that of the Central Provident Fund 

Board (CPFB) to streamline the handling of premium 

collections for Medisave. Our distribution partners can 

submit Raffles Shield application via an electronic form 

which reduces turnaround time.

• Electronic Meal Ordering System (ELMOS) was 

also implemented in Raffles Hospital, with the aim of 

transforming the traditional meal ordering process 

into a fully integrated experience. In 2018, the team 

at Raffles Hospital developed our own in-house 



ELMOS after gathering 

information 

on 

our 

patient’s meal ordering 

process with the aim of 

improving and speeding 

up our patient’s meal-

ordering 

experience. 

After implementation of 

ELMOS since January 

2019, we now spend an 

average of 40 minutes 

from the time a meal 

is ordered, to the time 

a meal is served. As 

compared to 2018, this is 

a significant 41 per cent savings in man hours that is 

now better spent on patient care. 

• The launch of the e-Notification of Live Birth (eNLB) 

and e-Certificate of Cause of Death (eCCOD) is a 

collaboration between Immigration &amp; Checkpoints 

Authority (ICA) and Raffles Hospital. These were 

launched via ICA’s e-portal in April 2019 and July 2019, 

respectively, with the aim to convert all paper notification 

to electronic notification. With this initiative, human 

error as a result of illegible handwriting is eliminated. 

Employees at the Delivery suites as well as doctors 

are granted access to the respective e-portal to do the 

necessary notification with reduced turnaround time. 

This paperless initiative has also helped us to further 

contribute to a greener environment. 

• RMG has completed the medical records unification 

of general practitioner (GP), specialist outpatient and 

inpatient into a single Discharge Summary system. 

GPs and specialists in clinics are now able to view a 

summary of an individual’s inpatient visits electronically 

without the hassle of tracing physical case notes. This 

helps in improving productivity and allows more time to 

be spent on addressing patient care. It also brings about 

better continuity of care as our patients can seamlessly 

transit from tertiary care to primary care, and vice versa, 

as needed.

CHAS, PG &amp; MG

All Raffles Medical and Raffles Dental clinics participate 

in the CHAS, PG and MG subsidy programmes to support 

the Singapore government’s efforts to serve the less 

privileged in the community. Singapore Citizens from lower- 

to middle-income households, Merdeka Generation, and 

all Pioneers, receive subsidies for their healthcare needs. 

 

For patients with chronic conditions, CHAS complements 

the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) 

which allows patients to tap on their Medisave to defray 

part of the chronic conditions outpatient treatments 

covered under CHAS and also enjoy CHAS subsidies for 

treatment.

Mayo Clinic Care Network

RMG is the first private medical network in Asia to be 

invited to join the Mayo Clinic Care Network (MCCN) 

in July 2015. Bridging the finest medical expertise from 

Mayo Clinic to RMG, this collaboration offers RMG’s 

patients easy access to experts from Mayo Clinic without 

the need to travel. 

 

This collaboration means that RMG doctors have access 

to electronic communication tools to access the latest 

Mayo Clinic knowledge and expertise for the benefit of 

our patients. The partnership also promotes physician 

teamwork and complements our local expertise. 

The Group was invited to join MCCN because of the 

shared philosophy, commitment and mission to improve 

the delivery of health care through high quality, data-

driven, and evidence-based medical care and treatment. 

In addition, the Group has also passed MCCN’s rigorous 

review process based on quality, service and operational 

criteria.

The MCCN is a unique collaboration that connects RMG 

with their subject experts and resources. Under the 

collaboration, there are regular exchanges of knowledge 

between our specialists and MCCN doctors. 

A web-based information 

system that allows doctors 

to quickly connect with up

Delivering Best Outcomes

Accreditations - Joint 

Commission International 

Raffles Hospital has been accredited by 

the Joint Commission International (JCI) 

since 2008; a solid testament of our 

commitment to patient safety and care. 

Our employees adhere to the six International Patient 

Safety Goals (IPSG) as follows:

IPSG 1 - Identify patients correctly

IPSG 2 - Improve effective communication

IPSG 3 - Improve the safety of high-alert medications

IPSG 4 - Ensure safe surgery

IPSG 5 - Reduce the risk of healthcare-associated  

 

infections

IPSG 6 - Reduce the risk of patient harm resulting 

 

from falls

The JCI standards are revised every three years 

to ensure that they remain current and address the 

changing healthcare demands for better care and 

patient safety. Raffles Hospital is accredited to JCI’s 

sixth edition and latest standards. The sixth edition, 

which includes several new requirements, raises the 

expectations and stimulates Raffles Hospital to deliver 

care that is evidence-based, uniformed, and of high 

standards taking into consideration local needs, laws 

and regulations, and diverse culture and religion. 

Clinical Audits

Clinical audits are done as part of RMG’s medical 

professional clinical governance. In addition to mortality 

and morbidity review, the following committees look into 

the different areas of clinical quality programmes:

• Medical Audit Committee

• Surgical Audit Committee

• Pharmacy &amp; Therapeutics Committee

• Infection Control Committee

• Operating Theatre Committee

• Blood Transfusion and Tissue Review Committee

• Patient Case Review Committee

• Critical Care Committee

• Trauma Committee

• Transplant Committee

The Quality Committee, who has overall oversight of 

these committees, reviews and evaluates their activities 

and programmes with collective decision that benefits the 

organisation to promote patient safety.

Clinical Resource Utilisation 

Resource utilisation is embedded in the Quality Assurance 

committee’s terms and references to help the Group to 

look into accessibility of services through the use of data. 

This allows Raffles Hospital to optimise limited resources 

to ensure we meet our patients’ needs.

Incident Reporting

The Group’s leadership advocates sharing of feedback 

by our healthcare professionals across all spectrums in 

Raffles Hospital. This includes reporting on an event, a 

process or condition that causes harm or has the potential 

to cause harm or injury to our patients and customers. 

 

In addition, there is proactive review of clinical incidences /  

feedback where a team of healthcare professionals 

relevant to that process comes together for general 

consensus following an in depth deliberation. There is also 

a process for group-wide escalation and standardisation. 

This culture of maintaining open conversations and self-

checks ensures we have the opportunity to improve on 

current practices. 




21

RMG is a holistic employer that focuses on developing 

the careers of our employees, as well as ensuring their 

physical and emotional well-being. Every year, we conduct 

basic health screening, seasonal influenza vaccinations, 

and also organise other health and wellness activities to 

engage our employees. The annual health screenings 

provide employees with greater awareness of their health 

status while exercise classes and various wellness 

activities organised by the Raffles Recreation Club provide 

a platform for employees to adopt a healthier lifestyle. 

Since 2012, we have been offering RMG scholarships 

to groom healthcare professionals and future business 

leaders. As we expand our regional presence, we will 

Employees

Our Approach

offer scholarships to both local and international students 

over the next three years with the aim to nurture a 

pipeline of talents. In addition, we will continue to nurture 

and sponsor high-potential employees to help them 

strengthen both their technical and leadership skills for 

personal development and career advancement.

 

In 2019, a Talent Management Board was put together 

to look into management and leadership development at 

the Group level, and succession planning. To enhance 

our capabilities and meet our expansion plans in the 

region, we have grown our key management team with 

the addition of key management personnel at the Group 

level, for both our Singapore and overseas offices.

Talent Development &amp; Retention

Hiring, Recruitment and Retention

In 2019, RMG strengthened hiring for key business 

functions in the hospital, primary care networks, and 

health insurance to meet the needs of our customers, 

patients and stakeholders. 

To meet the diverse manpower needs of our business, 

the Human Capital department held two walk-in career 

fairs at Raffles Hospital in April and October 2019. The 

fairs attracted more than 300 applicants with interest 

in nursing, allied health, ancillary, hospital operations, 

sales and administration. The team also reached out 

to applicants in the neighbourhoods by participating 

in community job fairs for vacancies at various Raffles 

Medical clinics. 

We continued to strengthen our engagement with the 

local polytechnics and universities by bringing the 

Raffles brand to schools and students. RMG participated 

actively in career talks, attachments, sponsorships 

and recruitment with Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Nanyang 

Polytechnic and Republic Polytechnic, to name a few. 

RMG organised tea sessions at Raffles Hospital with 

specialised groups such as our Nursing team to share 

our vision and what we do to inspire the students. We 

have also successfully organised a small-scale targeted 

recruitment drive for Raffles Health Insurance. 

Overall, various avenues and platforms were tapped into 

to extend outreach to clinical and non-clinical professionals 

from different medical specialties and functions. To date, the 

staff strength of Raffles Medical is diverse and comprises 

a mix of reputable local professionals, top international 

talents, and functional leads in the healthcare industry. 

They include specialists, physicians, nurses, allied health 

professionals, and managers from Singapore, Malaysia, 

Vietnam, Philippines, China, and Europe.

Training Learning and Development

The Group strongly believes in developing people by 

growing our own timber. We are committed to nurturing 

and developing employees who can continue to enhance 

and embody our values and culture. Therefore, Raffles 

Healthcare Institute (RHCI), the education arm of 

RMG, was commissioned in 2013 with the objective of 

training local and overseas healthcare professionals and 

operation staff.

We will continue to invest in developing our employees 

through specific knowledge and skills they need in 

their jobs. Building a world-class team with high-level 

capabilities not only helps the business, it also supports 

us as a choice employer.

Employees are also offered various training initiatives 

such as mandatory core training, department specific 

functional training, on-the-job training, cross-training in 

multiple functions, and mentoring.

At RMG, it is vital for employees to keep themselves 

abreast of the latest technological and industry 

developments. The Group is constantly creating 

opportunities for employees to grow through continuous 

training and professional development. Employees 

are given the opportunity to upgrade their skills and 

qualifications through study sponsorships. 

Leadership Development – Rising In 

Strategic Excellence (RISE) Programme 

Apart from RHCI’s training offerings, RMG continues 

to invest in grooming our middle managers and senior 

management team. 

There were 20 managers who were groomed by RHCI 

through the seventh intake of the RISE Programme 

from July to November 2019 that showcased four 

business 

management 

projects. 

This 

programme 

is 

a 

leaders-train-leaders 

programme 

designed 

to nurture RMG’s managers to become business 

leaders, equipping them with leadership development 

skills 

and 

to 

sharpen 

their 

business 

acumen. 

Mayo Workshops – Quality, Leadership 

and Human Resource Management

Leveraging the Group’s collaboration with the Mayo 

Clinic, RHCI organised a series of workshops on 

quality improvement, leadership and human resource 

management. Senior Advisers from Mayo’s teaching 

faculty were invited as keynote speakers, and the Institute 

tailored the workshops to achieve specific learning 

outcomes for RMG’s executive and management team. 

The 

facilitators 

deployed 

a 

variety 

of 

teaching 

methodologies to promote action learning, and empower 

participants to apply their newly acquired skills and 

knowledge to direct improvements at the workplace. 
















Employees

23

These contextualised workshops held by the Mayo team 

served to expose managers, executives and supervisors 

to best practices in healthcare and acquire fresh insights 

on quality, leadership and human resource to enhance 

people management and quality improvement initiatives 

for the Group.

New Training Offering – Human 

Resource Management

RHCI introduced two new Human Resource topics for 

line managers, namely Mastering The Employment Act 

and Triumphing Over Staff Grievance.  

The workshop on Employment Act serves to equip 

line managers with holistic knowledge on the various 

provisions of the Employment Act and its applications 

on day-to-day dealings at the workplace. On Grievance 

Handling, participants were taught the nature of staff 

grievances and the dire consequences of mishandling 

grievances. Line managers were introduced to the 

company’s code of conduct, and learnt to apply the hot 

stove rules of exercising progressive discipline to address 

disciplinary infractions. With a clear understanding of 

the legal rights surrounding the termination of service, 

department managers were empowered to defuse 

sensitive disciplinary matters professionally and foster 

positive working relationships at the workplace. 

Advocating Workplace Safety

 

Total Workplace Safety &amp; Health (WSH)

Total WSH, is an integrated approach to managing 

safety, health and employee well-being at the workplace. 

Because safety and health are inter-related, a healthy 

workforce is a safe and productive workforce. The Group 

conducted a baseline survey in 2018 to assess staff 

perception and understanding of Total WSH. The survey 

resulted in new initiatives implemented in addition to the 

existing and ongoing employee health programmes. 

At RMG, WSH-related training is a regular training where 

our employees are equipped with knowledge on how 

they can perform their work safely yet efficiently. One of 

the training programmes, 5S Housekeeping, which is a 

common training in most industries, has been customised 

for our employees to include safety. The programme 

is renamed as 6S Housekeeping. Apart from imparting 

knowledge on identifying wastages and redundancies to 

streamline and improve our processes and systems in a 

safe manner, the training also promotes stronger employee 

commitment and ownership. 

Occupational Health &amp; Safety (403) 

Since 2013, RMG is a certified BizSAFE Level 3 Company 

awarded by the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) 

Council Singapore based on an independent audit by a 

Ministry of Manpower (MOM) approved WSH Auditor.

As a commitment towards maintaining a safe and healthy 

work environment for our employees in compliance with 

legislative requirements, the Group is committed to: 

• Comply with all statutory safety and health requirements, 

and other existing standards and guidelines.

• Eliminate hazards or adopt reasonably practicable 

means to reduce the risk of injury to its employees to an 

acceptable level.

• Seek the involvement of various stakeholders to 

effectively implement WSH Policy objectives.

• Improve continuously through on-going reviews of  

WSH mechanisms. 

• Provide adequate resources to ensure compliance to 

WSH Act and its Regulations.

• Prepare its employees and build up organisational 

resilience to manage and respond to terror threats.

RMG is also represented in the national Workplace 

Safety &amp; Health Council (Healthcare) that works closely 

with the MOM and other government agencies, the 

industry, unions, and professional associations to develop 

strategies to raise WSH standards in Singapore.

New Hospital Extension Building and 

Renovation Work Sites

All risk assessment and supporting documents submitted 

by contractors are evaluated prior by the Safety team, 

Facilities team and the Infection Control team to ensure 

all possible Workplace Safety &amp; Health risks associated 

with construction and renovation projects are adequately 

addressed. Regular inspections carried out by these 

teams ensure all areas of non-compliance are rectified 

immediately to safeguard the well-being of the staff, 

patients and visitors.

Annual Review of Risk Assessments

The Group adopts Risk Assessment review annually, 

which is above the national regulatory requirement 

of once in three years. This rigorous effort enforces 

and ensures that our employees take ownership to: 

• Assess their respective work processes and activities

• Identify process change, new workplace hazard and /

or patient safety concerns

• Revise and update the organisational risk register










Employees

The Group has also incorporated SGSecure component 

into our risk assessment to mitigate potential terror 

threats, which is in line with the national movement. 

In August 2019, a combined exercise was held with 

the Singapore Police Force and Singapore Civil 

Defence Force. The purpose was to improve the 

preparedness of our staff during terrorist attacks. The 

two simulated scenarios were held on our premises 

where participating employees proved that they were 

well-prepared to respond to emergency situations. 

Strengthening the RMG Culture

 

Fair Employment Practices 

RMG aims to eliminate discrimination on all grounds 

and promotes equal opportunities, and a fair working 

environment for all our employees. We adopt a human 

resources policy that combines a role-based system that 

grades individual employees based on the extent of their 

roles, with a performance-based approach to evaluation, 

and compensation based on the outcomes of their job 

performance within their respective roles.

We respect the right of employees to adhere to normal 

or agreed working hours in accordance with the 

Company Policy established in compliance with the laws 

and regulations.

The Group is committed to ensure that the welfare of 

workers and labour conditions within its supply chain 

meets or exceeds recognised standards.

Diversity

At RMG, diversity in our workforce is critical in giving us 

the added advantage of strength and local knowledge 

because of the diverse markets and patient-groups that 

we serve.

The Group supports the Tripartite Guidelines on the re-

employment of older employees.

Conducive Working Environment

The Group works hand in hand with our employees to 

build a conducive workplace. Employees’ inputs are 

important which is why various feedback channels are 

provided for them to contribute to the improvement of the 

workplace. RMG adopts an inclusive culture and open 

approach so as to keep the team aligned with the Group’s 

actions and directions, in our journey to shape the future 

of healthcare. 

At RMG, employees’ views are actively sought after 

and acted upon, creating an inclusive work environment 

based on mutual trust and respect. The senior 

management values employees’ feedback and takes the  

lead in creating an inclusive work culture. 

Large-scale meetings such as the Annual Staff Meeting 

and Annual Management Meeting are held to keep 

employees posted on the Company’s results and 

performance as well as important developments that 

are in the pipeline. At the same time, these platforms 

help employees to forge closer working relations and 

engagement across teams. 

Quarterly social engagements are funded by RMG to 

encourage the respective departments to hold social 

activities for the employees. Professional consultation 

and referrals under the Employee Assistance Programme 

(EAP) are also available to help employees gain insights 

on their emotional well-being and seek treatment if 

necessary. 

Staff Wellness &amp; Benefits (401-2)

RMG aims to provide a work environment that is 

safe and conducive for every employee. Each year, 

the company provides free health screening and 

vaccination for all employees with an option to enhance 

to a comprehensive health screening with their flexi-

benefits. RMG understands that every employee has 

different needs, and therefore, offers benefits packages 

with different options and flexibility to meet the needs of 

eligible employees and their family members. 

Employee benefits include: 

 

• Medical and dental consultation and / or treatment 

reimbursement 

• Hospitalisation benefits

• Comprehensive health screening applicable to 

employees above 40 years old

• Additional insurance coverage (other than Work Injury 

Compensation insurance coverage) 

• Transport allowance 

• Training and development 

• Reimbursement for professional fees with professional 

associations

• Long Service Award

Part-time 

employees 

enjoy 

pro-rated 

benefits 

in 

accordance with their working hours. 

Parental Leave (401-3) 

RMG employees are eligible for parental leave, maternity 

leave, paternity leave and shared parental leave in line 

with the Ministry of Social and Family Development’s 

guidelines.

This award accords recognition to the Group for 

incorporating user-friendly features in our building, 

creating an environment that considers the needs of 

a broad spectrum of demographics to encourage an 

inclusive society. This includes groups like the young, 

elderly, and persons with limited mobility.

Better Energy Management

To work towards our target of reducing the electricity 

consumption index in the next three years, the Group 

has implemented smart meters, timers and motion 

sensors installed in Raffles Specialist Centre. All 

lightings, chillers and air handling units are scheduled 

for automatic power on and off at specific timings 

according to their required usage pattern. This allows 

the Group to efficiently control the usage and conserve 

energy overall.

 

Less Paper, More Seamless Service 

More 

digital 

initiatives 

have 

been 

progressively 

introduced by the Group as part of our efforts to 

reduce paper use as well as manpower cost. The 

Group has digitised internal systems to enable 

paperless processes such as online job requests for 

inter-department job orders, and online submission 

of digital forms for raising internal change requests. 

For increased manpower efficiency, RMG’s Raffles 

Connect 

automates 

the 

queuing 

and 

registration 

processes for patients who want to consult a doctor at a 

RMG clinic. Raffles Connect is a secured integrated digital 

platform where patients can access critical healthcare 

services round the clock. For instance, eQueue, which 

is a digital personal queue system on Raffles Connect, 

allows patients to obtain a queue number before 

arriving at their preferred Raffles Medical clinic. Upon 

arrival at the clinic, patient registration is automatic 

and seamless. The patient is then notified via the 

smartphone when it is time for the doctor’s consultation.  

With our integrated Electronic Medical Records and 

patient care system, our doctors have access to patients’ 

medical records and information to provide seamless 

and continuity of care for our patients, eliminating much 

manual labour that would have been needed to trace and 

reconcile patient records across different facilities within 

the RMG network. This helps in improving productivity 

and allows more time to be spent on addressing patient 

care. It also brings about better continuity of care 

as our patients can seamlessly transit from tertiary 

care to primary care, and vice versa, as needed. 

The Electronic Meal Ordering System (ELMOS) was 

also implemented in Raffles Hospital, with the aim of 

transforming the traditional meal ordering process into a 

fully integrated and paperless experience. In 2018, the 

team at Raffles Hospital developed our own in-house 

ELMOS and launched it in January 2019. Massive 

time savings of over 40 per cent has been recorded as 

compared to pre-ELMOS period. With ELMOS, our team 

takes an average of about 40 minutes to process a meal 

order from the time a meal is ordered, to the time a meal 

is served. This significant manpower savings is now better 

invested in patient care. 

Recycling

 

Waste Minimisation and Recycling

Our general waste index has increased slightly in 2019 

due to increased occupancy and footfall at our facilities.  

 

The Group’s increased efforts in heightening employees’ 

awareness of recycling programmes in all our buildings 

have paid off. In 2019, we registered an increase in 

recycling tonnage by about 62 per cent as compared to 

the year before.

Water Conservation (303-3)

 

Improved Water Efficiency &amp; Awareness 

Despite the increase in the tenancy occupancy rate, 

our water consumption index has improved. Even then, 

we will continue to roll out awareness, education and 

advocacy materials to help our tenants and employees 

understand the importance of water conversation.  

 

To achieve RMG’s target of reducing the water 

consumption index, the following steps are adopted: 

• Water efficiency courses within the RMG network will be 

conducted with more frequency. 

• Increased internal awareness, education and advocacy 

of water conservation among RMG employees through 

appropriate communications materials and activities.

• Regular checks within the RMG buildings will be 

conducted to ensure that faulty water fittings are 

replaced with water-efficiency labelled fittings.

In May 2019, as part of our emergency plan, the Group 

also carried out a combined exercise with the Public 

Utilities Board (PUB) to supply water to Raffles Hospital 

during a water emergency situation. Several scenarios 

were simulated, and water supplies to Raffles Hospital 

were provided through the nearby hydrants and PUB 

water pumps. This exercise has helped to prepare the 

team at RMG to respond to and manage water emergency 

situations in the future.

Our Approach

In 2019, the Group continued to grow financially and 

contributed positively to the economy through creation 

of rewarding jobs in Singapore and regionally. Through 

efficient use of resources coupled with strong financial 

management, we were able to grow responsibly as a 

company in order to provide our employees, shareholders 

and partners with positive economic returns. 

RMG doctors, dentists and nurses continued to engage in 

community outreach activities such as conducting basic 

health screening sessions, giving health education talks 

and advice on healthy ageing to senior citizens. Participants 

are encouraged to share their knowledge within their social 

circles, thereby raising awareness of healthy ageing in the 

community. Our doctors are also involved in running clinics 

for foreign workers on a regular basis.

In addition, we invested in strategic corporate social 

responsibility programmes to contribute to the well-being 

of the Singapore community.  

Moving forward, we target to maintain a financially strong 

and healthy balance sheet and cash flow to create long-

term value for our stakeholders.

Community Investments

The Asian Medical Foundation was created in 2003 by 

a group of doctors and nurses in RMG with the aim to 

serve the medical and healthcare needs of the poor and 

the under-privileged. Our investments in these strategic 

corporate social responsibilty programmes contributed to 

the well-being of the Singapore community.

Outreach

RMG doctors and nurses regularly engage in community 

outreach activities such as conducting basic health 

screening sessions, giving health education talks 

and advice on healthy ageing to senior citizens and 

distributing masks at community centres in various 

parts of Singapore. Participants who attend the talks are 

encouraged to share their knowledge among their social 

circles, thereby raising the awareness of healthy ageing 

in the community. Some of our doctors are also involved 

in running clinics for foreign workers on a regular basis. In 

addition, RMG supports the early detection of top cancers 

in Singapore through various initiatives. These include 

issuing free FOBT kits and discounted mammogram 

screening packages. 

Enhanced Screen for Life (SFL) 

Raffles Medical supports SFL, the national screening 

programme by the Health Promotion Board that offers 

Singaporeans and Permanent Residents health screening 

recommendations and the necessary follow-up based 

on age and gender. From September 2017, Pioneer 

Generation cardholders, Community Health Assist 

Scheme cardholders, and all other eligible Singaporeans 

can access subsidised Chronic Disease blood test, 

Colorectal Cancer test and Cervical Cancer test with one 

post-screening consultation at a subsidised fee at Raffles 

Medical’s CHAS clinics. 

 

Primary Care Network (PCN) 

Raffles Medical has been officially awarded under MOH 

PCN Scheme for five years. MOH will provide funding 

of operational and administrative support to Raffles 

Medical General Practitioners for managing patients 

with chronic disease conditions. Raffles Medical’s PCN 

has nurse counsellors, care coordinators, and chronic 

disease registries to help manage patients with more 

complex chronic conditions and care needs. New services 

offered are Diabetes Foot Screening, Diabetes Retinal 

Photography and Nurse Counselling.

Health Supplements

RMG provides complimentary supplements to members of 

the community through various events such as health talks 

and charity events. This effort helps to raise awareness on 

the importance of health and wellness, and provides an 

avenue for those in need of such support to receive the 

needed help.

Our Community (413-1) 

RMG is proud to do our part as a responsible corporate 

citizen, investing time and resources to make a positive 

impact to the communities that we operate in. Among 

our employees, we promote and organise corporate 

volunteerism activities that focus on instilling a culture 

of giving-back. This is in line with our core value of 

Compassion.

Volunteerism

Since June 2015, doctors and TCM physicians from 

RMG have visited the Zion Home for the Aged on 

a monthly basis to provide medical consultations, 

acupuncture service and advice for the residents. 

Residents who require further specialist consultations 

are referred to Raffles Hospital for X-rays, laboratory 

tests and medication by specialist doctors at no expense. 

 

Zion Home for the Aged

In early December, our volunteers treated residents at 

the Home to an early Christmas lunch consisting of a 

buffet meal. Volunteers also engaged with the residents 

over a sing-along session of Christmas carols. 

PERTAPIS Senior Citizen Fellowship Home 

Our volunteers from RMG organised a jumble sale to 

raise funds for PERTAPIS Senior Citizen Fellowship 

Home. Donation of a variety of new and gently-used 

items were donated by our employees to help more than 

3,000 needy families who are looked after by this home. 

The Food Bank Singapore 

Foodbank collects excess food from food suppliers and 

re-distributes them to organisations such as old folks 

homes, family service centres, and soup kitchens. Our 

team of 20 volunteers spent a Saturday afternoon in 

December sorting out donated food items at the Food 

Bank, in preparation for delivery to needy families.

Bursaries, Scholarships and 

Sponsorships

 

Scholarship and Sponsorship 

Since 2013, the Group has granted a total of 38 

scholarships and six sponsorships to help students 

who may need an extra boost in reaching their life’s 

goal. In 2019, four students were awarded the RMG

assistance to our employees for their children’s education, 

giving them a head start in their life and career.  

Clinical Training and Internships

RMG trains physicians, nurses, allied health and 

healthcare managers in collaboration with local medical 

schools, 

polytechnics 

and 

vocational 

institutions

educational experience of each student / trainee by 

providing not only clinical experience, but also exposure 

to private sector standards of service excellence and 

business management.

Job Creation 

Where we operate, RMG generates employment, 

partnerships, and contracts for local small-medium 

enterprises and tax revenues for governments. This 

in turn contributes to the development of the economy 

where we operate. 

Corporate Governance

 

Customer Privacy (418-1)

Patient confidentiality is an important aspect of 

healthcare and we strive to maintain it. We have clear 

policies pertaining to the Personal Data Protection Act 

(PDPA) drawn up since 2014. We obtain patient consent 

for collection and use, and disclosure and processing 

of personal data for exclusive healthcare related use. 

We work closely with third parties who support the 

healthcare delivery (including insurance companies and 

other healthcare companies) to ensure compliance to 

the RMG PDPA policy. Patients can at any point in time 

choose to unsubscribe or opt out from SMS reminders. 

Staff are guided to call patients only for matters related 

to direct patient care. The Group’s privacy statements 

can be found on the corporate website (www.

rafflesmedicalgroup.com).

In line with the PDPA act, RMG has appointed Data 

Protection Officers to ensure that adequate action is 

taken to protect customers’ personal data. Policies are in 

place to address data protection issues.

As a Group, we received zero substantiated complaints in 

the year. No complaints were raised to regulatory bodies. 

No incident of leak, theft or loss of customer data has 

been identified in the year.

The IT department and the Medical Record Office 

manage secure databases to safeguard personal data 

and patient records. We adhere to security best practices 

in the Healthcare and Financial Institutions industry. The 

Group has been audited against the Monetary Authority 

of Singapore Technology Risk Management Framework. 

We engage Managed Security Services Providers to 

counsel the Group accordingly. Employees undergo 

orientation, e-training and are regularly updated on the 

latest cybersecurity threats and best practices. 

In order to protect the data of our patients or corporate 

clients, we have various security technologies in place 

such as Web Application Firewalls (to detect DDOS, web 

application cyber-attacks), Next Generation Firewall (to 

prevent unauthorised intrusions), Advanced End Point 

Prevention (to prevent zero day exploits) and Security 

Monitoring by a Managed Security Provider. This is 

in addition to the alignment of industry security best 

practices with our people (through security awareness 

programmes) and processes. 

Our Suppliers &amp; Contractors

Our business thrives because of strong, ethical and 

mutually beneficial relationships we maintain with our 

suppliers and contractors. 

Our support for local-based businesses have contributed 

to the national economic development. We advocate 

ethical business practices through establishing policies 

and practices that ensure a fair selection and procurement 

process. We maintain good relationships with our vendors 

through on-going engagement during meetings and 

tender interviews, to ensure continuity of services and to 

keep them abreast of our latest developments.

Local vendors have always been our preferred option 

in procuring products and services. They are preferred 

due to proximity, shorter turnaround time, and delivering 

reliable products and services. Our business activities 

with them had supported indirect job creations and 

sustained local businesses.

Supply Chain (102-9, 102-10)

We are committed to ensuring that the welfare of workers 

and labour conditions within their supply chain meet or 

exceed recognised standards. There are no significant 

changes to our organisation and supply chain.

Ethics and Ethical Trading (102-17)

We are committed to managing our vendors ethically 

and effectively to ensure safe and sustainable practices, 

which create value for all our stakeholders. At RMG, 

we ensure that our employees uphold professional 

standards, workplace standards and behaviours that are 

consistent with the Group’s policy and practices. We are 

committed to working against corruption in all its forms, 

including extortion and bribery. 

All new hires at RMG are required to attend the RMG 

Onboarding Programme and Creating Service Delight 

within the first three months of employment. Employees 

are briefed on values, principles, ethics, standards and 

norms of behaviour.

Procurement Practices (204-1)

We work with suppliers, sub-contractors and other 

service providers to adopt responsible business policies 

and practices for mutual benefit, while not compromising 

the Group’s policies and guidelines. At RMG, we have a 

centralised procurement team handling purchases of our 

network of clinics located island wide. This has enabled us 

to achieve economic of scales and operational efficiencies. 

These efficiency gains are passed on to our patients and 

customers in the form of more affordable healthcare 

products and services.

We collaborate with suppliers and contractors to achieve 

our policy aspirations in the delivery of products and 

services. We encourage vendors to adopt responsible 

business ethics and practices for mutual benefits. We are 

also committed to ensuring that the welfare of workers and 

labour conditions within our supply chain meet or exceed 

recognised standards. For material projects, tenders are

compliance and adherence to national standards and 

regulations including those of licensing, infection control, 

workplace safety and other statutory requirements.

We are committed to exercise the utmost vigilance 

wherever our products and services are involved, whether 

or not they are distributed by one of our distribution 

channels or externally. This vigilance extends to third 

party products and services where, for example, the 

Company is acting as the distributor.

that we operate in. 

The management is committed to make regular periodic 

reports and updates to the MOH and MOM in Singapore 

as well as other relevant government agencies and 

regulatory bodies in the regions that we operate in.

regulations including those of licensing, infection control, 

workplace safety and other statutory requirements.

The Group has not identified any significant non-

compliance with national standards and regulations.

Anti-Corruption (205-1, 205-2) 

We recognise the need to manage our exposure to 

corruption risk through good corporate governance, 

business ethics and strong internal controls in our 

business processes. 

We conduct an annual enterprise risk assessment 

applicable to all business units in the group. The 

assessment allows us to identify and mitigate areas of 

high risk, including corruption. All identified business risks 

include residual risks, are reported to the Audit and Risk 

Committee and subsequently to the Board of Directors.

Staff undergo e-learning on anti-corruption and bribery 

during the year. The various whistleblowing channels are 

also highlighted during the training. 

We provide guidelines on suitable staff responses to 

gifts from customers or business associates. These 

guidelines serve to protect and uphold the reputation, 

professionalism and integrity of RMG and its staff. This is 

to avoid any corporate obligation to customers or business 

associates resulting from gifts or favours received. 

All members of senior management, physicians as 

well as staff who are involved in procurement make an 

annual declaration of any conflict of interest. For risk 

management purposes, certain group of staff except 

physicians and nurses are required to take block leave 

break of at least five consecutive working days at least 

once a year. The block leave should be scheduled at the 

beginning of the year.

We conduct annual vendor evaluation to ensure that 

contractors and suppliers comply to certain performance 

standards as required by the Group.

 

Whistleblowing 

We have a whistleblowing policy and procedures that 

enable staff and other persons to raise in-confidence, 

whether anonymously or otherwise, concerns on possible 

improprieties relating to any wrongdoing or malpractice 

within the Group, without fear of reprisal in any form. 

Under these procedures, all reports will be listened to, 

investigated and treated in confidence. To facilitate and 

encourage reporting, the whistleblowing policy together 

with 

the 

dedicated 

whistleblowing 

communication 

channels such as RMG’s email and postal address 

are available on the Group’s intranet. They are easily 

accessible by all staff. Necessary safeguards are also 

taken to protect whistleblowers.

Direct email channels to the Audit and Risk Committee 

or the Executive Chairman, General Managers are also 

available for reports involving any director and / or senior 

management.
