Board

Statement

At	Best	World	International	Limited	(the	“Company”	or	“Best	World”),	The	

Board	 of	 Directors	 (the	 “Board”)	 believes	 that	 to	 fulfil	 our	 commitment	

to	provide	our	stakeholders	with	long	term	value,	sustainability	needs	to	

be	 	 ingrained	 in	 our	 business	 model.	 Since	 inception,	 Best	 World	 has	

always	 focused	 on	 our	 products,	 our	 customers	 and	 our	 people,	 while	

practising good strong corporate governance and minimising our impact 

on the environment.

In	response	to	the	Singapore	Exchange	Securities	Trading	Limited	(“SGX-

ST”)	introducing	sustainability	reporting	on	a	“comply	or	explain”	basis,	we	

have	embarked	on	our	formal	sustainability	reporting	journey	to	publish	our	

inaugural	Sustainability	Report	for	FY2017.	

The	Board’s	primary	focus	with	respect	to	Sustainability	Reporting	are:

 

a. Considering sustainability issues including environmental and social

 

 

factors	in	the	formulation	of	the	Group’s	strategies;

 

b.	Overseeing	the	identification,	monitoring	and	management	of	key	

 

 

Environmental,	Social	and	Governance	(“ESG”)	topics;	and	

 

c. Determining the Company’s values and standards including ethical 

 

 

standards

The	 Board	 will	 continue	 to	 work	 with	 the	 management	 to	 implement,	

monitor	and	report	on	our	sustainability	efforts	for	the	long	term	success	

of	the	Group.	As	we	continue	to	build	on	our	sustainability	efforts,	we	look	

forward	to	establishing	stronger	ties	with	our	stakeholders	and	growing	

along	with	our	community	at	large.	

BEST WORLD INTERNATIONAL


4

Best	World	was	founded	in	1990	with	a	vision	to	be	a	

global	leading	health	and	wellness	company	dedicated	

to	creating	product	brands	that	enhance	the	lives	of	

our	customers.	Since	then,	we	hold	true	to	that	vision	

and have progressively developed many innovative 

beauty,	 health	 and	 wellness	 products	 for	 discerning	

customers all across Asia. 

In	 FY2016,	 our	 business	 attained	 new	 heights	

when	Group	revenue	exceeded	$200	million	for	the	

first	time.	From	FY2017	on,	we	continue	to	ride	on	

this	growth	momentum,	ever	mindful	of	the	need	to	

introduce sustainable business practices into our 

corporate	principles,	in	order	to	achieve	growth	with	a	

higher	degree	of	reliability	and	sustainability.	

In	 this	 regard,	 our	 key	 focus	 is	 on	 our	 distributors,	

employees	 and	 products,	 which	 can	 be	 detailed	 as	

follows:	

OUR DISTRIBUTORS

People	 have	 always	 been	 the	 backbone	 of	 our	

business.	Our	distributors	are	no	exception.	

Through consistent engagement and a comprehensive 

education	program	which	we	refined	over	the	years,	

we	ensure	that	our	distributors	are	adequately	trained	

with	updated	product	knowledge,	business	skills	and	

current	 best	 practices,	 and	 also	 inculcated	 with	 a	

strong ethics. 

The	 100%	 satisfaction	 rates	 we	 achieved	 for	 our	

Singapore distributors’ surveys underscore the 

mutually	 beneficial	 relationship	 we	 have	 established	

with	them	over	the	years.	

BEST WORLD INTERNATIONAL

In	FY2017,	the	Group	also	reached	multiple	training	

milestones	for	distributors	in	our	largest	direct-selling	

market	of	Taiwan,	when	compared	to	FY2016:

 • 50% increase in total attendance of our training  

  events; 

 • 27% increase in number of training events held; and

 • 41% increase in total number of training days 

The need to give back to the society has always been 

a big part of our corporate culture and we always 

believe that we have a social responsibility to inspire 

and improve the lives of the people around us. It is 

therefore only natural that we are committed to helping 

the economically-disadvantaged around the world. 

Our World Learner Student Exchange Scholarship 

(“WLSES”) is in its 8th year and has awarded almost 

300 exchange scholarships to over 40 beneficiary 

schools since its inauguration in 2010.

OUR EMPLOYEES

Since	 inception,	 Best	 World’s	 family	 of	 extremely	

committed and experienced employees have been 

crucial	 to	 our	 continued	 success.	 Their	 unwavering	

support and dedication to our mission is evident in our 

extremely	high	employee	retention	rate	of	95%	and	the	

higher	than	average	length	of	service	for	most	of	our	

employees	in	our	Taiwan	and	Singapore	subsidiaries.	

To	ensure	spontaneity	in	our	communications,	we	have	

always	maintained	an	open-door	policy	for	employees	

in	Singapore	and	our	foreign	subsidiaries.	

Our	 remuneration	 polices	 not	 only	 reward	 personal	

performance	but	also	share	the	fruits	of	the	company’s	

performance	so	that	everyone	holds	a	personal	stake	

in	the	company’s	performance	and	profitability.	

Statement 

From Chairmen

We	have	also	formally	launched	the	Best	World	Code	

of	Ethical	Conduct	for	all	employees	in	the	Group	so	

that everyone understands and adheres by the moral 

and	ethical	principles	which	the	Group	upholds.	

As	 a	 company	 that	 prides	 itself	 on	 progress	 and	

growth,	we	are	aware	of	the	importance	to	improve	

the	 capabilities	 of	 our	 employees	 to	 sustain	 our	

fundamental	asset.	To	this	end,	we	set	training	goals	

annually	and	fully	support	our	staff	in	attending	training	

tailored	 to	 their	 specialties.	 Best	 World	 has	 always	

been	a	frontrunner	when	it	comes	to	gender	diversity	

in	 the	 workplace.	 This	 is	 evident	 in	 our	 Taiwan	 and	

Singapore	offices,	where	females	comprise:	

	•	68%	of	total	staff;

	•	56%	of	middle	management;	and

	•	33%	of	senior	management	and	Board	of	Directors	

OUR PRODUCTS

Substantial	 effort	 goes	 toward	 product	 development	

and	quality	control,	where	we	stringently	trial,	check	

and	 test	 the	 skincare	 and	 nutritional	 supplement	

products	we	market.	

As	 we	 expand	 our	 regional	 presence,	 we	 strive	 to	

ensure that our labelling and advertising are accurate 

and	 factual,	 and	 that	 our	 intellectual	 properties	 and	

brands are not only presented consistent to our brand 

guidelines	but	also	well	protected.	

Although	 sustainability	 reporting	 is	 still	 new	 to	 us,	

we	 are	 dedicated	 to	 it	 and	 are	 highly	 aware	 that	

sustainable	 business	 growth	 is	 a	 continual	 process.	

While	we	may	not	be	where	we	want	to	be	in	every	

respect,	 we	 recognise	 what	 we	 have	 achieved	 thus	

far	and	intend	to	go	even	further	in	our	sustainability	

journey.	

As	we	embark	on	another	exciting	year	ahead,	we	will	

continue	 to	 engage	 all	 our	 stakeholders,	 as	 well	 as	

further	 strengthen	 our	 long-term	 strategic	 approach	

towards	engaging	our	global	network	of	distributors,	

while	also	maintaining	the	highest	standards	of	product	

quality,	reliability	and	safety.	We	will	also	assess	how	

we	can	minimise	our	environmental	footprint	even	as	

our	sales	volume	and	regional	presence	grow.	

Read	 our	 very	 first	 Sustainability	 Report	 to	 find	 out	

more	about	what	Best	World	has	achieved	over	the	

past	two	years	on	our	sustainable	business	journey.	

Our	 deepest,	 heartfelt	 gratitude	 goes	 out	 to	 all	 our	

stakeholders,	for	your	continued	support	and	trust	in	us!

Materiality 

Assessment

To	identify	the	Environmental,	Social	and	Governance	(“ESG”)	matters	that	

greatly	affect	our	business	and	stakeholders,	we	engaged	an	independent	

sustainability	consultant	and	initiated	a	formal	materiality	assessment	process.	

Both	internal	and	external	stakeholders	were	taken	into	consideration	for	

this	 assessment.	 With	 the	 contributions	 from	 different	 representatives	

from	relevant	departments,	we	adopted	a	four-step	materiality	assessment	

process	summarised	in	Figure	1	below:

A	preliminary	list	of	ESG	matters	were	selected	after	conducting	a	desktop	analysis	of

the	perspective	of	both	internal	and	external	stakeholders

BEST WORLD INTERNATIONAL

Business Ethics

At	 Best	 World,	 we	 are	 dedicated	 to	 operate	 our	

business in an honest and transparent manner. During 

the	process	of	expanding	into	rapid-growth	markets,	

where	 the	 operations	 are	 dependent	 on	 its	 local	

businesses	 and	 suppliers,	 there	 is	 a	 greater	 risk	 of	

exposure	to	corruption.	Our	group	has	adopted	a	zero-

tolerance	 approach	 towards	 all	 corruption	 practices	

and	have	strived	to	embed	a	culture	of	anti-corruption	

in	all	aspects	of	our	operations.	

Conflict of Interest Policy

Framework	to	guide	employees	on	

the	measures	to	take	to	prevent	

conflicts	of	interest	as	well	as	

action	steps	to	take	in	the	event	a	

conflict	arises.

Whistle-Blowing Policy

Provides	details	on	the	whistle-

blowing,	a	communication	for	

employees to anonymously report 

suspected	wrongful	activities	within	

the organisation to ensure a honest 

and transparent business conduct 

at	Best	World.

Gift and Entertainment Policy

Guidelines	for	employees	on	the	

proper procedures to process the 

gifts	and	entertainment	from	external	

parties to uphold business integrity.

Securities Dealing Policy

Provide	employees	with	an	

understanding	of	the	securities	

dealing	restrictions	put	in	place	for	

officers	and	insiders	by	the	SGX	

rules and Securities and Future Act.

Interested Persons 

Transactions Policy

Provides	clarifications	on	

interested person transactions and 

ensures	prompt	identification	and	

disclosure	according	to	the	SGX	

Rulebook	‘Chapter	9	-	Interested	

Person Transactions’. 

Non-Trade Procurement Policy

Guidance	on	how	to	establish	

procurement standards that optimise 

the	value	received	for	indirect	

purchases	and	services,	non-trade	

(indirect)	procurement	activities.	

Sustainable 

Governance

We	 have	 established	 a	 Code	 of	 Ethical	 Conduct,	

developed by our Human Resource department. This 

code explicitly states the organisation’s responsibility 

towards	employees,	consumers,	shareholders,	suppliers	

and	 regulators	 in	 both	 Singapore	 and	 Taiwan.	 The

Employees and Distributors Training 

and Advancement

As	 a	 leading	 health	 and	 wellness	 company	 with	 a	

global	presence,	continual	learning	is	fundamental	to	

the	growth	of	our	company.	We	recognise	that	training	

is	 an	 integral	 part	 of	 our	 business	 as	 it	 equips	 our	

employees	with	the	necessary	skills	and	enhances	their	

ability to carry out their roles and responsibilities. In 

compliance	with	ISO9001:2015	Quality	Management	

System	requirements,	we	have	developed	procedures	

to	ensure	quality	assurance	across	our	processes;	we	

provide regular trainings related to these procedure to 

all,	including	distributors	who	market	our	products.	

In	 both	 Singapore	 and	 Taiwan,	 weekly	 trainings	 are	

conducted.	Some	of	the	trainings	conducted	in	FY2017	

are	listed	below.

The average training hours are achieved by our 

employees	are	illustrated	in	Figures	4	and	5	below:

Under	 the	 guidance	 of	 the	 respective	 department	

heads,	Best	World	aims	to	achieve	a	minimum	average	

of	 16	 hours	 of	 training	 per	 employee	 annually.	 The	

average	 training	 hours	 per	 employee	 improved	 from	

13.1 hours in FY2016 to 16.8 hours in FY2017. 

Best	 World	 will	 continue	 to	 strive	 towards	 providing	

all	our	employees	with	ample	learning	opportunities	to	

develop	their	capabilities	and	skillsets.

Counterfeit Products and Intellectual Property

In	the	recent	years,	the	issue	of	counterfeit	products	has	

posed	several	challenges	for	companies.	These	unsafe	

products	 can	 influence	 the	 consumers’	 perception	 of	

legitimate products and even put consumers’ health 

and	 safety	 at	 risk.	 Without	 proper	 management	 and	

measures,	it	may	lead	to	a	loss	of	consumer	confidence	

and	in	turn,	negativity	affect	product	sales.	At	Best	World,	

we	 are	 aware	 of	 the	 adverse	 effects	 that	 counterfeit	

products	can	bring	about.	Therefore,	to	safeguard	the	

interests	of	our	business	and	our	consumers,	we	have	

in	place	strict	measures	to	manage	the	risks	associated	

with	counterfeit	products.	

Under	the	stewardship	of	our	Regulatory	Department	

and	 Legal	 Department	 who	 oversees	 the	 product	

and	trademark	registrations	processes	respectively	in	

different	regions,	counterfeit	products	and	intellectual	

properties	are	properly	managed.	By	the	end	of	each	

year,	 we	 target	 to	 have	 all	 our	 brands’	 trademarks	

registered	in	the	various	classes	for	all	the	markets	

we	are	involved	in.	

In	2017,	we	have	registered	our	trademarks	in	more	

new	 regions,	 reaching	 a	 total	 of	 26	 regions.	 Moving	

forward,	we	will	also	be	using	QR	codes,	which	will	allow	

users	to	scan	the	product	and	determine	whether	the	

product	is	authentic	on	DR’s	Secret	product	packaging	

for	Taiwan	in	FY2018.

Responsible Labelling/Advertising

Lapses	 in	 labelling	 and	 advertising	 can	 affect	 not	

just	our	brands	and	reputation	as	an	organisation	but	

potentially	cause	harm	to	our	consumers	as	well.	We	

care	deeply	about	the	people	we	serve.	We	recognise	

the	consequences	of	mislabelling	and	biased	advertising	

of	our	products.	The	lack	of	transparency	in	reporting	

all	product	ingredients	used	or	the	effects	it	may	cause	

prevents	consumers	from	making	an	informed	decision	

about	the	product	they	purchased,	which	can	lead	to	

serious	aftermaths.	By	upholding	our	business	integrity	

in	marketing	our	products,	we	aim	to	achieve	zero	cases	

of	non-compliance	with	the	Singapore	Health	Science	

Authority	and	the	Taiwan	Food	and	Drug	Administration’s	

labelling	and	product	claim	requirements.	As	such,	strict	

practices	 are	 implemented	 to	 fortify	 our	 labelling	 and	

advertising	 process.	 Labels	 are	 checked	 against	 the	

regional	labeling	requirements,	product	claim	guidelines	

and	code	of	advertising	practices	to	ensure	compliance	

by	product	development	and	management	executives,	

content	writers	and	regional	product	registration	officers.	

Our	brand	incorporates	regional	labelling	requirements	

into	our	products,	complying	with	the	guidelines	of	the	

local	regulatory	bodies.	Information	on	the	country	of	

origin,	 product	 ingredients	 and	 directions	 for	 use	 are	

required	to	be	printed	on	all	products.	Only	products	

approved	by	these	regulatory	bodies	can	be	marketed.	

Claim	 substantiation	 is	 also	 performed	 to	 prevent	

mislabelling	or	false	advertising.	

In	2017,	we	had	zero	cases	of	non-compliance	and	

we	hope	to	maintain	this	track	record.

“We are proud to announce 

that in the year 2017, two 

of our products assessed, 

namely PentaLab balancing 

Oil and Avance GLO 

Caps, fulfil all regulatory 

requirements.”

Consumer Health and Safety

At	Best	World,	we	do	not	compromise	on	the	quality	of	our	

products.	We	remain	committed	to	product	excellence	

and	strive	to	ensure	regulatory	compliance	for	all	of	our	

products.	Throughout	the	development	of	our	products,	

from	product	concept	design	to	formulation	review	and	

safety	assessment	to	product	stability	and	compatibility	

study	to	consumer	product	trial	and	finally	to	the	product	

lab	testing	stage,	we	enforce	stringent	quality	standards	

that abide by regulations by local regulatory boards. 

We	 collaborate	 with	 external	 accredited	 labs	 regularly	

for	quality	assurance	of	our	own	cosmetics	and	health	

supplements.	 To	 further	 monitor	 the	 performance	

of	 our	 merchandises,	 we	 instituted	 a	 coherent	 and	

systematic	process	for	customers	to	provide	feedback	

on	our	products.	Regional	centres	will	receive	feedback	

via	online	customer	service	email	or	physically	and	will	

compile	the	feedbacks	received	into	a	monthly	report	for	

submission	to	HQ.	The	quality	control	department	at	HQ	

will	keep	track	of	incidence	rate	and	conduct	necessary	

investigation	and	corrective	actions	where	required.	

Under	 the	 care	 of	 our	 Product	 Development	 team	

and	 Quality	 Control	 team,	 we	 recorded	 zero	 cases	

pertaining	to	consumer	health	and	safety	in	2017.	We	

aim	to	continue	to	assess	the	health	and	safety	impact	

of	all	our	products.

Case Study

Collaboration with SGS Taiwan

In	partnership	with	SGS	Taiwan,	Taiwan’s	

largest	and	most	diverse	independent	quality	

testing	facilities.	Best	World	was	able	to	

establish	our	very	own	quality	assurance	

zone	on	the	SGS	Taiwan	Safety	Information	

Platform.	Contaminant	test	reports	for	

microbial,	heavy	metals,	pesticide,	western	

drug	and	cosmetic	steroid	etc.,	related	to	our	

products	are	uploaded	on	their	website	for	

customers’	reference.

Consumer Satisfaction

Sustaining a viable business cannot be done 

independently.	 At	 Best	 World,	 we	 understand	 the	

importance	 of	 customer	 engagement	 and	 channel	

much	 resources	 to	 it.	 We	 begin	 by	 engaging	 our	

distributors,	who	directly	interacts	with	our	consumers.	

By	conducting	monthly	surveys	with	distributors,	we	

are	 able	 to	 garner	 their	 responses,	 have	 a	 better	

understanding	 of	 their	 feedback	 and	 concern,	 and	

make	improvements	based	on	the	feedback	received.	

Furthermore,	 regular	 trainings	 and	 events	 are	 also	

arranged	by	the	local	team	to	engage	with	distributors.	



In	FY2017,	we	managed	to	obtain	100%	satisfaction	

rate	(defined	as	a	score	of	4	or	5	out	of	a	scale	of	1	

to	5)	on	distributor	satisfaction	surveys	and	member	

satisfaction	surveys.

Packaging Management

At	 Best	 World,	 our	 commitment	 to	 environmental	

sustainability	also	extends	to	our	packaging	materials.	

On	top	of	ensuring	that	the	packaging	materials	we	

use can provide enough protection and are compatible 

with	our	products	and	brand	image,	we	also	strive	to	

minimise its environmental impacts. 

Best	 World	 has	 taken	 steps	 to	 promote	 the	 use	 of	

reusable	carriers.	From	2012	to	2015,	our	Taiwan	office	

procured and gave out reusable carriers in the hopes 

that	these	carriers	can	be	used	in	place	of	paper	bags.	

In	2015,	our	Singapore	office	launched	a	woven	felt	

bag	with	the	same	purpose	in	mind.	From	time	to	time,	

we	also	evaluate	the	designs	of	our	product	carriers	to	

enhance	its	reusability	by	considering	factors	such	as	

the	ease	of	storage	and	innovative	ways	in	which	the	

bag can be carried. 

Moving	forward,	Best	World	hopes	to	look	into	other	

possibilities	 of	 making	 its	 packaging	 and	 packaging	

practices	more	environmentally	friendly.

Waste Disposal Management

Proper	waste	management	is	essential	for	the	well-

being	of	the	environment.	As	a	distributor	of	consumer	

products,	waste	in	the	forms	of	containers	and	plastics	

are	 inevitable	 in	 the	 packaging	 process.	 We	 seek	

to	 ensure	 that	 our	 waste	 is	 properly	 managed	 and	

disposed	to	ensure	the	safety	of	our	community.	

Singapore

Our	 Singapore	 operations	 are	 served	 by	 National	

Environment	Agency	registered	waste	collectors.

In	FY2016,	there	were	no	hazardous	waste	disposal	

as	the	hazardous	waste	generated	was	only	disposed	

in	 FY2017.	 In	 FY2017,	 40kg	 of	 hazardous	 waste	

was	disposed.	The	40kg	was	generated	in	the	two	to	

three years leading up to FY2017 but only disposed in 

FY2017.	The	hazardous	waste	were	generated	from	

chemicals	 used	 in	 labelling	 our	 products.	 Before	 its	

disposal,	the	waste	is	collected	in	a	capped	bottle	and	

stored	in	a	designated	isolated	area	for	safety	reasons.	

Figure	 6	 summarises	 the	 amount	 of	 non-hazardous	

waste	 produced	 in	 the	 Singapore	 operation	 for	

FY2016 and FY2017.  The decrease is mainly due to 

a	drop	in	sales	volume	in	Taiwan	in	FY2017.	

Taiwan	

No	 hazardous	 waste	 was	 generated	 by	 our	 Taiwan	

operations in FY2016 and FY2017. 

Figure	7	summaries	the	amount	of	non-hazardous	waste	

disposed	in	Taiwan.	The	non-hazardous	waste	generated	

mainly	pertains	to	expired	products	as	well	as	products	

that	were	returned	or	exchanged	by	consumers.	Due	to	

the	quantity	of	such	products	in	FY2017,	we	outsource	

the	disposal	to	a	third-party	contractor.		

In	 FY2017,	 there	 were	 no	 cases	 of	 improper	 waste	

disposal	and	we	will	continue	to	make	efforts	to	maintain	

these standards.
