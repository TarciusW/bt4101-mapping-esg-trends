ceo Statement

Welcome to our seventh Sustainability Report which aims 

to update all stakeholders on performance, highlights, 

challenges and stories across a set of material topics.

IndoAgri has over 100 years of experience in the plantation 

industry. Our work on sustainability began from the ground 

up over 30 years ago, with investment in our seed business to 

deliver high-yield, disease-resistant oil palm seeds, which 

today have become the leading oil palm seed material in 

Indonesia. Yields can potentially reach ten tonnes of CPO/

ha/year, which can mean a requirement for less land and 

lower pressure to clear new land. 

As the definition and coverage of sustainability risk have 

evolved, so IndoAgri has responded. We are proud of this 

responsiveness, which is a foundation principle of corporate 

accountability, and we do it whilst delivering our commercial 

strategy aim: to be a leading, integrated agribusiness. For 

example, governments, customers, consumers and other 

stakeholders increasingly want to know where palm oil 

comes from, how it is cultivated and how it compares to other 

edible oils. And we note how Indonesians possess growing 

levels of environmental literacy: our domestic market is 

significant and Indonesians know the importance of palm 

oil to the national economy. In response, provide a high 

quality and safe product that gives the customer confidence 

and that demonstrates our ability to produce all of our 

crops in a sustainable manner. And whilst palm oil appears 

to attract the most of the attention of the public compared 

to other crops, our sustainability policy and programmes 

cover all of our plantation crops and refineries.

Year-on-year we have seen some good sustainability 

performance 

improvements 

and, 

naturally, 

some 

challenges, managed by teams of people who are diligently 

committed to realising our Sustainable Palm Oil Policy (our 

Policy) on the ground across our operations and our supply 

chains. 2018 saw some highlights and some challenges 

which are shown overleaf, but I would draw your attention 

to my top three:

1. Safety

2. Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) certification

3. Community

Our safety management system is embedded across 

all operations. IndoAgri’s Board has pushed for better 

harvesting practices near powerlines in 2018, and has also 

made clear the importance of near-miss awareness and 

reporting. Regrettably, we endured four fatalities in palm oil 

operations in 2018. We are investigating to mitigate the same 

risk elsewhere and are supporting the family and colleagues 

involved.

We have worked hard over the last 14 years to expand our 

production of certified CPO, to implement improvements, 

and share what is learned with operations yet to be certified. 

We aim to have all palm plantation and milling assets ISPO 

certified by the end of 2019; we achieved 80% of our target 

by the end of 2018. This covers all mills and estates and 

contributes to our target to ensure that 100% of CPO we 

refine is sourced in accordance with our Policy by the end 

of 2020. ISPO is a legally binding, mandatory certification 

for all oil palm growers in the country and was developed 

by the Indonesian Government which is closely aligned to 

the principles and criteria of Roundtable on Sustainable 

Palm Oil (RSPO). Further, we are delighted to see in 2018 

some promising yields from our certified smallholders and 

during the year we assisted one smallholder cooperative 

(‘KUD’) through an ISPO stage 1 audit in South Sumatra. 

Community investment also represents a beacon of success.  

I am proud of our flagship cleft lip programme: a vital 

contribution to society in Indonesia which delivered 130 

operations in 2018 for 112 people, mostly children. Health 

clinics and first aid posts are provided on every estate for 

workers and their families. We provide community health 

centres (‘Posyandu’) for maternal and infant health, which 

serve infants in the vicinity of our operations. In 2018, we 

had 197 medical clinics on our estates and 206 Posyandu, 

supported by 277 midwives/nurses and 60 doctors. 

We operate at scale. We monitor our operations extensively. 

But when performance on the ground does not match 

the expectations of our management or stakeholders, we 

commit to resolve the issue in an open and transparent 

manner. This is responsiveness in action. We have made 

steadfast effort to fully engage with the RSPO Complaints 

process since 2016 relating to the allegations of human 

rights and labour violations at one of our North Sumatra 

operations. Subsequent to an independent audit, the 

RSPO Complaints Panel (CP) suspended one of our North 

Sumatra mills without taking note of our robust evidence 

substantiating our compliance, and without accepting our 

request to meet and discuss the findings of the audit. The 

findings were materially different from the previous 23 

RSPO audits conducted in our North Sumatra operations, 

which we passed as fully compliant with RSPO standards. 

The RSPO CP refused to communicate on, or explain, the 

material difference between their verification audit and 

the 23 prior audits. This demonstrated a lack of reciprocal 

openness and transparency: we therefore decided to 

withdraw our PT Salim Ivomas Pratama Tbk (SIMP) and PT 

PP London Sumatra Indonesia Tbk (Lonsum) operations 

from the RSPO and instead focus on the ISPO certification. 

We continue to comply with Indonesian laws and 

regulations, and to deliver our policies relating to labour 

practices and human rights. Again, in 2018, no dispute or 

other issues arose with any of our seven labour unions or 

with the Indonesian Ministry of Labour. We have regular 

bipartite meetings with our unions to ensure an open and 

transparent dialogue. 

Our Board has overall responsibility for sustainability 

issues, validates material environment, social and 

governance (ESG) factors and oversees their management 

and monitoring. Sustainability is at the core of how we work, 

from our high-yielding seed research 30 years ago, our 

Sustainable Palm Oil Policy, and our ISPO commitments 

into the future. We look forward to ongoing improvements 

towards our goals.

my childhood was spent growing up on 

indoagri’s Sungai rumbia 1 estate, my 

father is an administration officer there 

and my mother runs the household. living 

on the estate i had a similar quality of life to 

that of other children of my age. the estate 

provides opportunities for children to 

achieve qualifications: my entire education 

was made possible through indoagri’s 

support. the company provides a quality 

education and good facilities, such as a 

bus service which certainly saves time to 

focus on my studies. indoagri empowered 

me. i went on to successfully graduate with 

a bachelor of medicine from abdurrab 

university at Pekanbaru, riau in 2014. my 

education has enabled me to work as a 

doctor in a public hospital. 

Dr. Dewi Sasmita Kumalasari, Medical Doctor  

and daughter of Mr. Siswanta, employee of  

the Sungai Rumbia 1 Estate, Riau 

growing up on indoagri’s Sei rumbia 

estate meant that my formative years 

were spent in the plantations. my father, mr 

temu, has worked for the Sungai rumbia 1 

estate at indoagri since 1991. i am grateful 

for a formal education in a school provided 

by indoagri: i studied in the school owned 

by the plantation after which i continued 

my high school education in Pekanbaru 

city and then on to malang to continue 

my studies in medicine. the schooling 

instilled in me the ability to overcome any 

hardships: it gave me the confidence to 

strive for my goals. i am now serving as a 

doctor in efarina hospital, riau. my goals 

and dreams were made possible by access 

to facilities and encouragement that i 

received while growing up on the estates 

of indoagri.

The image above illustrates our approach. 

governance arrangementS for 

SuStainability 

Our Board actively considers sustainability issues, reviews 

our material environmental, social and governance (ESG) 

topics and oversees their management and monitoring.  

IndoAgri’s sustainability management is led by the CEO 

who updates the Board on sustainability management 

initiatives, performance against key ESG topics, stakeholder 

engagement and the Group’s response to issues arising. 

A Sustainability Think Tank meets regularly to review 

the sustainability progress and direction and comprises 

Executive Directors, Chief Operating Officers, Enterprise 

Risk Management (ERM) unit, R&amp;D team and sustainability 

representatives from all business units. Our Audit and Risk 

Management Committee is updated on a quarterly basis 

on matters relating to material sustainability risks and 

concerns. 

Our CEO personally takes part in discussions and correspondence 

relating to ongoing impacts in the field. Senior leaders of the 

sustainability team in Jakarta regularly report internally at 

SIMP’s Board level on issues such as process safety and 

efficiency, community investment and supply chain certification. 

Headline performance indicators are discussed, changes of 

direction are decided as appropriate, and often in consultation 

with other executives in the Indofood Group. Applying the 

precautionary principle in our management of material ESG 

topics, we are committed to prevent undesirable impacts and 

analyse alternatives in an accountable manner.

We evaluate our performance for material topics by 

measuring progress towards targets. The targets for 

certain material topics are an extension of the ISPO 

certification of estates and processing sites and the 

Indonesian 

Government's 

Programme 

for 

Pollution 

Control, Evaluation, and Rating (PROPER) environmental 

reporting initiative, namely (i) Governance and integrity;  

(ii) Land rights; (iii) Smallholder engagement and livelihoods. 

Evaluation of our approach depends on audit (internal and 

external), performance trends and stakeholder feedback. 

Our regular internal audits, monitoring and assessments are 

guided by the ISO 14001 Environment Management Systems 

and the ISO 9001 Quality Management Systems. ISPO 

certification is a key tool to help deliver on our Policy goals on 

deforestation, land rights, peatland, burning, smallholders 

and human rights.

Palm oil (iSPo) certification

The Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil certification 

system (ISPO) is a mandatory certification for all oil 

palm growers in the country. ISPO was developed by the 

Indonesian Government to closely align  the principles 

and criteria of RSPO to meet the international standard1. 

ISPO also aims to support the Indonesian Government’s 

commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 

(GHG) through the cultivation of a sustainable plantation 

industry. The Government plans to make it mandatory 

for smallholders, for whom it is currently voluntary.

To ensure that ISPO requirements are implemented 

in the field consistently, a certification system helps to 

guarantee that CPO and palm kernel oil (PKO) produced 

from the supplier is sustainable. ISPO certification 

requires oil palm applicant companies to pass a Plantation 

Business Assessment (Penilaian Usaha Perkebunan - 

PUP) administered by the Regional Plantation Estates 

Office (at the Province or District level), resulting in 

the determination of either a Class I, II or III plantation 

classification. The classification is a prerequisite for 

companies seeking ISPO certification, to ensure that their 

operations implement the requirements. 

The ISPO audit is conducted by a government approved 

certification body in two stages:

1. Compliance audit of plantation licenses and required 

business documentation. 

2. Plantation audit assessing 

•	 all	documentation	concerning	adherence	to	the	

ISPO Principles and Criteria (P&amp;C) in the estates 

and mills

•	 competency	of	workers	involved	in	management	

of estates and mills

•	 confirmation	of	adherence	to	the	P&amp;C	by	external	

stakeholders

The ISPO P&amp;C must be fulfilled in order to obtain the 

ISPO certification:

•	 Principle	1:	Legal	plantation	business	permits

 

Criteria specify companies to operate in accordance 

to Indonesian laws and regulations, plantation 

to operate on land free from disputes, and that 

land disputes must be resolved in accordance to 

Indonesian laws and regulations 

•	 Principle	2:	Plantation	management

 

Criteria include application of technical cultivation 

guidelines related to land clearing, use of water 

resource, planting, pest management, FFB harvest and 

processing, transportation, and waste management

•	 Principle	3:	Protection	of	primary	forest	and	

peatland

 

Criteria stipulate company’s obligation for conservation 

of	HCV	and	protected	areas,	fire	prevention	and	control,	

peatland management, and reforestation of land

•	 Principle	4:	Environmental	management	and	

monitoring

 

Criteria set down compulsory environmental impact 

assessments and mitigation of GHG emissions by 

company

•	 Principle	5:	Responsibility	to	workers

 

Criteria prescribe company’s obligations regarding 

occupational health and safety management systems, 

employee welfare, trade unions and workers co-

operatives, and prohibition of discrimination and 

child labour     

•	 Principle	6:	Social	responsibility	and	

community	economic	empowerment

 

Criteria set forth social responsibility of companies 

such as empowerment of indigenous communities, 

development of local communities, and procurement 

of goods and services from local communities

•	 Principle	7:	Continuous	business	improvement

 

Criteria stipulate the continuous improvement 

of sustainability practices by developing and 

implementing actions that support the production of 

sustainable palm oil

environment

our aPProach

We are committed to reducing our environmental impacts, we 

have a commercial responsibility to use resources efficiently. 

We formally evaluate environmental risks to the business 

and the value of eco-systems.

Our Sustainable Palm Oil Policy 2017 sets environmental 

commitments throughout our value chain on material 

issues, such as climate change, land management, 

biodiversity, and transboundary haze.

Environmental improvements are guided by the six Programmes, 

which also focus on land use and smallholder environmental 

practices. We have put in place ERM framework and Whistle-

blowing mechanism to ensure compliance with the relevant 

environmental requirements and to manage such risks.

reSPonSible Sourcing

our aPProach

Our markets demand clarity on where palm oil comes from 

and the impacts upstream. Commercial success depends on 

our customers having confidence in our products. As their 

purchasing patterns are under scrutiny, good information 

from our products can help improve transparency on food 

safety, seed quality, and cultivation practices.

Whilst palm oil supply chains are complex and challenging 

we are committed to collaborating with others to enable 

more responsible and profitable practices. The use of ISPO 

certification is a key component of our approach to delivering 

on our Policy and commitments. By the end of 2019 we aim to 

have all our palm oil production certified to ISPO standards.

Good working relations with our suppliers and growers 

is important to encouraging transparency, influencing 

sustainability in the palm industry, and increasing communities’ 

resilience against economic, social, or political hardship.

Product Safety, Product 

Quality 

our aPProach

The oil palm has the highest yield of any edible oil crop 

and is extremely versatile. Palm oil is used extensively in 

thousands of food and non-food products. We face pressure 

from many customers to ensure full product traceability, 

and regulators increasingly demand more information on 

ingredients, such as nutritional content. Product quality and 

safety are fundamental to our commercial success. Our Quality 

Policy and Sustainable Palm Oil Policy commit us to maintain 

product quality, process safety, as well as the implementation 

of food safety management systems and quality assurance 

at our refineries. We also provide full certification to local 

and international food safety standards such as Indonesia 

National Standard (SNI) and FSSC 22000.

Our regulatory compliance commitments extend to food 

safety, consumer protection, quality and nutrition, labelling 

and advertising. 

Our R&amp;D, marketing and sales teams use independent 

market-testing to meet quality requirements and accredited 

laboratories to test the quality and safety of our products 

against relevant health, safety and regulatory standards. All 

CPO raw materials supplied to us can be traced back to their 

milling site, and batch numbers on product packaging allows 

traceability. An approved Halal certification system applies 

to all our products and refineries, it is accredited to LPPOM 

MUI, the Research Institute for Food, Drugs and Cosmetics 

of the Indonesian Ulemas Council.

Customers can contact our operations openly by phone, 

e-mail and post, on any aspect of production. 

PeoPle and community

our aPProach

Our actions are directed by our Policy, which commits us to 

protect and respect the rights of our workers, comply with 

the Indonesian law as well as the UN Universal Declaration 

on Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation 

codes of practice ratified by the Republic of Indonesia. Through 

our Policy, we aim to provide a conducive work environment for 

our people. We manage the safety, training and development, 

evaluation, remuneration, and engagement of our workforce 

to meet our targets and commitments to our stakeholders.

All IndoAgri employees receive a wage that is within or above 

the minimum wage of their respective region, in addition 

to a range of benefits and incentives such as healthcare 

and education. Minimum wages in Indonesia are set by 

the regional government, by considering the local cost of 

living. We support the rights of our employees to bargain 

collectively. All our workers are free to register themselves 

with their preferred labour union.

Safety is a top priority. Guided by our Policy, we have a rigorous 

Occupational Health and Safety management system in place 

to minimise accidents and negative health impacts.

Through our Training and Development programmes, we 

seek to achieve professional development, knowledge 

exchange and a skilled workforce: essential components to 

organisational success.

As one of the biggest palm oil companies with operations 

in rural Indonesia, we aim to boost the quality of life for 

our smallholders and communities through inclusive and 

sustainable development. Our Work and Estate Living 

Programme ensures that economic development meets the 

needs of the community and local governments.

oil Palm: our PrinciPal croP

Our palm oil business which is based in Indonesia is involved 

in every aspect of palm oil production. We develop and 

innovate seeds and planting materials, manage plantation 

operations, harvest and mill the Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFB) 

of palm trees into CPO in our mills, refine and process CPO 

and Palm Kernel (PK) into higher value products such as 

cooking oil, margarine, and shortening.

Since 77% of our CPO processed in refineries comes from our own 

plantations, we have greater control of ‘value drivers’ relating to 

how we manage sustainability risks and opportunities.

Our oil palm seeds are produced using world-renowned 

breeding populations from Southeast Asia and Africa. We aim 

to meet the evolving needs of our customers and stakeholders 

through our R&amp;D initiatives. We have two advanced seed 

breeding R&amp;D centres: Sumbio, in North Sumatra and PT SAIN 

in Pekanbaru. They produce high-yielding seed material, free 

of Genetically Modified Organisms which attract a premium on 

the open market.

As of 31 December 2018, our total planted oil palm estates 

were 251,112 hectares, of which 16% were immature 

estates. The age of our oil palms averaged 15 years, which 

is a key factor affecting our CPO production moving forward.

In 2018, our total FFB production from our nucleus estates, 

plasma and third parties was 4,424,000 tonnes. These FFB 

were processed into 921,000 tonnes of CPO. 

other croPS

In 2018, we produced 9,600 tonnes of sheet or cup lump 

rubber from operations in North and South Sumatra, East 

Kalimantan and Sulawesi. Around half of it is exported to 

countries such as Singapore, the US and UK.

Through joint ventures and other investments, we also own 

sugar operations in Indonesia, Brazil and the Philippines. 

We expanded our sugar production capacity in Brazil with 

the investment of two sugar and ethanol mills in 2018. 

Together with our one existing mill, this gives us a combined 

cane crushing capacity of 8.3 million tonnes annually. The 

proximity of the mills to one another in Minas Gerais will 

provide operational and management synergies.

workforce Profile

In 2018, IndoAgri employed 38,265 people (2017: 37,426) in 

permanent full-time positions, and 5,316 people (2017: 2,761) 

on short-term contracts in Indonesia. We also employed 

29,397 seasonal contract workers (2017: 31,836). 

96% of our employees are based in our field and processing 

sites, the rest comprises management and executive staff 

buSineSS overview



Our finished products  - cooking oil and margarine

In 2018, we produced 291,000 tonnes of sugar, 290,000 m3 

of ethanol and 305,000 MWh of electricity for export 

and domestic markets. Our sugar joint venture, CMAA’s 

Vale	 do	 Tijuco	 (UVT)	 operating	 unit,	 achieved	 Bonsucro	

certification for 869,000 tonnes of sugar cane harvested 

from 13,390 hectares, representing 100% of area available

Protecting foreStS

We	aim	to	preserve	areas	of	High	Conservation	Value	(HCV)	

and High Carbon Stock (HCS) within our operations. Prior 

to any new planting we use the HCS Approach Toolkit 2017 

which allows estates to quantify carbon stocks of assets 

and gauge FPIC in the community. 

environmental Performance

Since September 2013 our 

records show no new planting 

on peatlands, and water 

levels were maintained in all 

peatlands under our control

in 2018, we recorded:

- no primary forest clearance

- no degradation of hcv areas

While	identification	and	analysis	of	HCV	is	reviewed	once	

every	five	years,	regular	training	on	HCV	Monitoring	and	

Rehabilitation is conducted for employees in our estates. 

The	four-day	training	ensures	that	the	knowledge	on	HCV	

management and implementation of best-practices remains 

fresh and relevant. Conducted by subject-matter-experts 

from our Sustainability Department, this training aims to: 

(i)	 Ensure	the	existing	HCV	areas	remain	protected

(ii) Ensure proper implementation and management  

of	HCV

(iii)	Ensure	availability	of	personnel	who	understand	HCV	

concepts 

(iv)	Increase	capacity	of	our	employees	in	HCV	management

(v) Integrate sustainability principles such as production, 

ecology, and social in the management of natural 

resources which will benefit IndoAgri, communities, 

and other stakeholders

training on hcv monitoring and rehabilitation



Peatland 

Our Policy commits to no new planting on peat regardless 

of depth and to comply with related regulations of the 

Government of Indonesia.

Peatlands are a major source of carbon emissions when 

drained or burned and global monitoring of the sector is 

intensifying. 

Our	 HCV	 management	 approach	 described	 above	 also	

embraces peatland. Additionally, maintaining a minimum 

water table depth for our existing cultivated peatland is 

a top priority, and nucleus planting programmes must be 

approved at Executive Board level. We also ensure that our 

plasma and independent smallholders strictly practice 

peatland management.

Peatland Protection

The principal aim of the Water Management System of 

peatland for oil palm cultivation is ensuring that the soil 

supports the growth of the oil palm roots while maintaining 

optimum peat moisture to protect the physical and 

hydrological functions of peat. 

In managing peatlands IndoAgri focuses on two important 

aspects, namely:

(1) Water monitoring system, which is fully in accordance 

with government regulations

(2) Regular consultation with the Ministry of Environment 

and Forestry and the Ministry of Agriculture on the 

following aspects:

 

(a) Determination of water monitoring plots

 

(b) Preparation of field equipment for water monitoring 

 

(c) Implementation of water level monitoring

IndoAgri	 has	 under	 its	 control	 some	 areas	 of	 HCV	 which	

includes riparian areas, indigenous land, and habitats for 

endangered	species.	Therefore,	we	have	HCV	Management	

Plans at all our plantations (which are assessed by an 

accredited third-party). 

To deliver on the objectives of our Management Plans, 100% 

of	our	sites	have	HCV	Rehabilitation	Plans	up	and	running.	

We aim to deliver enriched biodiversity through reforestation 

in	existing	HCV	areas,	especially	riparian	areas.	Since	2017,	

we have planted approximately 164,000 trees in over 450 

hectares of riparian areas.

fire Prevention

We are monitoring hotspots and engaging stakeholders 

on fire prevention. Our enterprise risk team uses satellite 

data to gauge fire risk, while our operational teams ensure 

that land preparation is done mechanically and that good 

practice is shared with the communities. The way IndoAgri 

controls fires is systematic but it also depends on local 

engagement to achieve results.

Ministry of Environment and Forestry uses joint fire patrols, 

and regional disaster mitigation agencies work with the 

military and the police on prevention. IndoAgri aims to 

support them where possible and has delivered 135 fire 

control training days in 2018 (2017: 223 days).

In 2018 we invested in an additional 13 fire towers and 

once again continued our long-term collaboration with the 

local government, village chiefs, and local communities to 

build local capacity and knowledge to prevent fires through 

the socialisation programme. Since the launching of the 

programme in 2016, we have engaged 39 local villages. The 

programme has generally helped to reduce hotspots and fires.

Our collaborative initiatives, fire towers, equipment, and 

training collectively help to deliver on our commitment to 

zero burning on all assets (IndoAgri and suppliers) in line 

with our Sustainable Palm Oil Policy. 

environmental Performance

during 2018, our analysis 

indicated an improved level of 

fire risk control on our estates 

and surrounding community

reducing energy and ghg emiSSionS

Process efficiency leads to lower costs, lower carbon 

emissions and better shareholder returns.  

Our sustainability team continues working with colleagues 

from Indofood Group to focus on best management practices 

and resource efficiency. Supported by energy studies in 2016, 

the goal is to identify energy savings and earmark more sites 

with energy efficiency opportunities. We have 23 energy 

managers and 13 energy auditors across all our facilities.

In 2018, the energy consumption per tonne of FFB processed 

at our mills increased to 3.14 GJ/tonne from 3.11 GJ/tonne  in 

2017. In 2018, 99% of our milling fuel is from renewable shell 

and fibre by-products (99% in 2017).

Energy consumption per tonne of material produced at our 

refineries reduced to 0.22 GJ/tonne (0.25 GJ/tonne in 2017); 

9% of fuel used in our refineries is from renewable biomass 

(6% in 2017).

We have 23 energy managers and 13 energy 

auditors across all our facilities.

greenhouSe gaS emiSSionS

Our primary GHG emission (38.3%) is from land conversion 

i.e. changes in carbon stock during the development of our 

plantations. Therefore, conservation of HCS forests is a 

critical initiative by IndoAgri to retain stores of carbon and 

prevent GHG emissions.

Around 18.5% of IndoAgri’s GHG emissions are the result 

of naturally-occurring, low-level methane emissions from 

peat, rather than from its disturbance. Other sources are 

from Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME), fuel usage in our mills, 

and nitrous oxide emissions from fertilisers.

Total net emissions in 2018 for each tonne of palm product 

were 1.44 tonnes CO2e (2017: 1.54 tonnes CO2e). 

Emissions related to transport of CPO to four refineries were 

0.06 tonnes CO2e per tonne of CPO transported (2017: 0.07 

tonnes CO2e per tonne of CPO transported).

Our three aerated bunker composters continue to reduce 

methane emissions by 30%-70% compared with standard 

composting.

agricultural inPutS

We continue to apply good agricultural practices in 

our nucleus and plasma plantations, and to work with 

independent smallholders. From ‘laboratory to field’, 

our innovation teams aim to improve soil, minimise its 

degradation and improve yields. We are scaling up soil 

improvement technologies such as slow-release fertilisers 

and we continue to ensure widespread good estate 

management practices. Better yields mean less pressure 

to convert or clear land. Our other research focuses 

on environmental risks: such as integrated pest and 

disease management (IPM), soil and water conservation, 

fertiliser management and recycling mill by-products. The 

initiatives include the trial of a biodegradable ‘polybag’ for 

packaging growth materials for seedlings at our Bah Lias 

Research Station (BLRS) in March 2018. We compared the 

biodegradable polybags with the more commonly used 

alternatives to ensure that quality was maintained after 

12-18 months. Also, the trial of slow-release fertiliser bags 

made of biodegradable cassava help to prevent fertiliser 

wastage, water contamination and plastic pollution. The 

once-a-year application also saves time and resources 

while improving soil health and crop yields.  

On-going trial on fertiliser application using biodegradable cassava bags that decompose naturally to slowly release fertilisers to the roots of trees

Crop	health

Whilst pesticide use varies from year to year in all 

agribusinesses, we apply Integrated Pest Management 

techniques to achieve a variety of benefits such as cost 

savings, lower risk to human health and richer biodiversity. 

For example, we suppress weeds using leguminous cover 

crops, we encourage natural habitats for predators of leaf-

eating insects, and we continue deploying our successful 

Barn Owl rodent control programme. Chemical pesticides 

are only deployed when biological and natural controls have 

failed. We are pleased to report that we eliminated the use of 

Paraquat from all our operations since end of March 2018. 

IndoAgri complies with government regulations (Komite 

Pestisida) on restricted pesticides.

Fertiliser	consumption

We aim to improve our soils and water quality using a blend 

of precise fertiliser dosage and natural improvements. 

The use of fertilisers is tailored based on soil productivity 

and the age of trees in each plantation block. Whilst we 

administer fertiliser during planting and replanting, we 

also use leguminous cover crops to manage atmospheric 

nitrogen and improve the soil. We also recycle Empty Fruit 

Bunches (EFBs) and POME for use as a soil improver. In our 

estates, we ensure appropriate interval between fertiliser 

applications and avoid applying fertilisers during heavy rain.



avoiding chemical controls 

Chelisoches morio predates the sugarcane shoot and stem borer pest at all 

stages of its life cycle

IndoAgri has been using natural predators for more 

than two decades, our best-known predators are our 

barn owls. Here is another example: sugarcane stem 

borers are a pest threat to sugarcane plantations. They 

are moths that lay eggs on sugarcane leaves that hatch 

in less than a week to produce caterpillars that bore 

into the sugarcane stalks. The quantity and quality of 

sugarcane juice from an infested stalk are drastically 

impaired, thus posing an economic and environmental 

threat to our plantations and industry. 

 

On IndoAgri estates, we suppress the spread of this 

pest using natural, biological control. We introduce 

predatory insects that feed on the borer at every 

stage of its lifecycle, thus dwindling its population and 

safeguarding our sugarcane estates from infestation. 

In 2018, nearly five million insects from five different 

species were introduced in our sugarcane plantations 

to control the sugarcane borer population, resulting in 

lower use of insecticides.

water uSe efficiency 

With the changing climate, global water availability risk 

is an increasingly important issue. As water is a critical 

resource in our operations, water is managed carefully at 

our estates, mills and refineries. In tropical Indonesia, our 

estates are entirely watered by rainfall, 83% of mill water 

is from rivers; 84% of refinery water is from municipal 

sources; the proportions from groundwater and reverse 

osmosis are 16% and 0.3% respectively. 

Water used in office and site accommodation is from 

rain-harvest. All plantation site water is subject to formal 

environmental controls (AMDAL) and is within the scope 

of	 HCV	 assessment	 (page	 21).	 In	 2018,	 we	 recorded	 no	

incidences of non-compliance in water use and wastewater 

management.

•	 At	our	mills:	we	use	1,07	m3 of water per tonne of FFB 

processed, an increase of 12% compared to 2017 levels. 

Water consumption increased marginally due to higher 

FFB processed and also the installation of flow meters in 

some mills resulting in more accurate measurements.

waSte management 

Waste management is important to effective process 

efficiency and cost control. Our sites have waste 

management arrangements in compliance with Indonesian 

regulations and waste minimisation that is guided by 

PROPER and ISO 14001 processes. 

•	 At	our	mills:	we	produced	an	average	of	1.71	tonnes	of	

hazardous waste in 2018 (2017: 2.16 tonnes).

•	 At	our	refineries:	we	produced	a	total	of	26,882	tonnes	of	

hazardous waste in 2018 (30,032 tonnes in 2017), 74.2% 

of which is spent earth.

Our mills recycle 100% of milling wastes. Solid wastes 

consisting of EFB, fibre and shells are used as organic 

fertiliser or fuel for our boilers. Effluent from milling –  

POME – is generated by the processing FFB into CPO. Our 

solid waste and POME are managed in compliance with 

regulatory controls. Mill waste water, such as POME, is 

treated on site: an aerated bunker composting system is in 

place at three mill sites. 

•	 Mill	effluent	volume:	in	2018,	we	produced	1,925,340	m3 

of wastewater from our 20 certified/audited mills, down 

1% (2017: 1,946,984 m3).

•	 Mill	 effluent	 quality:	 the	 median	 Biological	 Oxygen	

Demand (BOD) was 2,660 mg/l at 20 certified/audited 

sites (2017: 2,410 mg/l).

Refinery effluent produced increased from 2017, and its 

quality remains in compliance with regulatory controls. The 

effluent is sent to waste water treatment plants prior to 

release into water courses or municipal sewers.

•	 In	2018,	we	produced	245,759	m3 of refinery wastewater 

(2017: 204,701 m3). 

No spills of effluent, CPO or diesel were recorded in 2018 

during harvesting, processing or transportation. No fines 

or sanctions related to environmental regulations were 

imposed on IndoAgri in 2018.

100% of hazardous waste is disposed according to national 

regulations and transported by an accredited third-party.

Note:   Data from 4 refineries. “Others” consist of batteries, 

filter oil, lubricants, electric lamps, rags, clinical 

waste, carbon waste, sludge waste, used nickel

100% of CPO we refine is traceable to mill, 77% of it is 

traceable to plantation. Meanwhile, all FFB processed at 

mills we control is traceable to plantation.

CPO	to	Refinery

77% of cPo is sourced internally

Our refineries purchase CPO from 43 mills, we know their 

addresses, ownership, and scale; 24 are IndoAgri mills. 

Part of traceability is for all IndoAgri and third-party CPO 

suppliers to formally accept our Sustainable Palm Oil Policy 

and Supplier Guidelines. By 2020, all CPO suppliers must 

operate in accordance with our Policy. We regularly audit 

our suppliers to ensure compliance with our Supplier 

Guidelines. Major findings and recommendations will be 

communicated and followed-up.

Our Policy expects that all suppliers achieve ISPO 

certification. All IndoAgri mills are scheduled to be ISPO-

certified by end 2019. 

 

FFb to mill

100% of ffb are from indoagri estates

All FFB arriving at IndoAgri mills are sourced from our 

plantations, of which 24% are from plasma.  

Our Policy commits us to traceable palm oil that ensures:

no planting on peat regardless of depth; no burning; and 

respect for Human Rights including Free Prior and Informed 

Consent.

certification 

Our ISPO-certified production in 2018 was 458,000 tonnes, 

representing 62% of our nucleus CPO production. We will 

continue with our initiatives to achieve our target of 100% 

ISPO certification by end of FY2019. 

A key target is for all our mills and nucleus estates to 

become ISPO-certified by end of 2019. As with all certification 

processes, 

the 

ISPO process requires management 

preparation, auditing (stage one, stage two), and certification. 

We audit our plantations, including plasma smallholders, as 

part of the ISPO certification process. We have a significant 

project in progress designed to achieve independent 

smallholder certification (page 35).

Seed breeding

Our Policy commits us to innovation in seed breeding to 

achieve productive growth and high yields.

Palm oil seeds are produced at our Bah Lias and SAIN 

Research Stations. Each Bah Lias seed is stamped 

and each batch is barcoded to provide assurance on 

its authenticity and quality. Bah Lias is supported by 

international scientists and our research station quality 

management systems are certified to ISO 9001.

IndoAgri maintains 

High Scorer status 

We maintained our ‘high scorer’ status and achieved a 

score of 69.8% (higher transparency; 30th percentile) in 

the Annual Sustainability Policy Transparency Toolkit 

(SPOTT) assessment for 2018. 

Developed by the Zoological Society of London 

(ZSL), SPOTT scores commodity producers and 

traders, including 70 palm oil companies, on over 

100 indicators in ten categories. These indicators 

are on the public disclosure of policies, operations, 

and commitments related to environmental, social, 

and governance (ESG) issues. SPOTT helps investors 

and buyers to inform their screening, sourcing, and 

due diligence processes. Please see this link for

conditions, we offer them with free advice and training. We 

also ensure that the costs of essential resources such as 

seed stocks and fertilisers are affordable to our plasma 

growers. 

Human rights assessment

Our human rights assessments were based on ISPO 

certification achievements. Our assessments will be 

achieved with the implementation of ISPO certification 

and the Indonesian Government regulation. We report 

that 69% of operational sites  units have been formally 

assessed for human rights risk in 2018. The competence 

developed through ISPO also informs and guides our 

other sites which are preparing for ISPO certification. 

All ISPO audits include criteria for assessing this risk for 

new suppliers.

In 2018, we recorded no human rights related Policy 

breaches through our whistle-blower mechanism. See  

page 46 for more on human rights.

Social	engagement/FPIC

As stated in our Policy, we are committed to respecting land 

rights and customary rights of communities and to fulfilling 

the requirements of FPIC before any operations begin. 

To deliver FPIC in practice, particularly with respect 

to land acquisition involving local villages, we assess 

community needs relevant to all sites using a Social 

Impact Assessment (SIA) before any new development. 

Through the SIA, we identify baseline conditions and 

likely social impacts of development. The SIA is a guide 

to how we work with local communities and governments 

on land tenure and rights. Our process sets out licenses, 

government policies, company policies, land valuations 

and proof of ownership to promote open negotiations, 

inclusive decision-making and clear agreements. 

In addition to FPIC, 100% of our estates have community 

development and engagement programmes. This is 

detailed in our Community section in page 48.

Smallholders

Smallholders are crucial stakeholders in our commitment 

to a traceable and sustainable supply chain. In Indonesia, 

smallholder plantations represent at least 40% of all palm 

oil cultivation, they generate exports and create jobs. The 

Indonesian Government plans to make ISPO mandatory 

for smallholder farmers; we aim to support and assist 

our smallholders achieve the ISPO certification once it is 

mandated. In 2018, we assisted one KUD (co-operative) 

in South Sumatra to achieve the ISPO certification. This 

smallholder KUD has successfully undergone the ISPO 

audit.

better Sourcing – for SuStainability and 

Quality

Supplier	management,	audit,	review

The scope of our Policy includes our estates (nucleus and 

plasma), 26 mills and all third-party CPO suppliers. 

As more than 77% of our CPO supply is from our own 

mills, this year we focussed our engagement and audit 

initiatives on internal supply chains. In 2018 we conducted 

121 visits, workshops, and audits on 100% of our mills and 

their supply base estates, focusing on:

•	 agronomy	 (Good	 Agricultural	 Practices,	 yield,	 soil	

health, crop protection);

•	 responsible	operations	(safety,	human	rights,	biodiversity,	 

peatland, fire risk);

•	 efficiency	of	operations	(energy	and	water	consumption,	

GHG emissions, waste production). 

Our  baseline supplier audit protocol includes relevant 

certification requirements expected of good practice 

auditing standards (compliance, environment, human 

rights, community engagement, FPIC). As we approach 

2020 we are improving our audit processes and preparing 

data on the levels of Policy compliance of suppliers, for 

review against the target at that time. 

To achieve a resilient supplier base, better agricultural 

productivity and sustainability on the ground, IndoAgri runs 

community projects which aim to improve local economic 

development and micro-enterprise opportunities (see 

page 48), alongside our smallholder certification project 

(see page 35). 

While all IndoAgri suppliers must meet legal and 

commercial conditions, our procurement team treats all 

suppliers with respect to price, quality and capacity.

yield	uplift

Palm oil yield is affected by age of palm trees, seed quality, 

soil and weather conditions, plantation management as 

well as timely harvesting and processing of FFB.

 

At IndoAgri, we produce seeds that potentially can produce 

approximately 34 tonnes of FFB per hectare. We are 

focussed on uplifting yields of our plantations and those of 

our smallholders, particularly as it reduces pressure for 

additional conversion of land for agricultural purposes. 

Our agronomy research teams continue to improve the 

yield of oil palm fruit. For example, improvements include 

shortening the duration of growth to maturity for harvest 

and increasing the number and weight of FFB of first 

harvest, and increasing the oil content in the FFB.

Yield and quality are closely connected. Our plasma 

and other smallholders are expected to meet the same 

quality criteria as nucleus suppliers. We encourage and 

coach them in high standards of agronomy and materials 

management leading to better yields and productivity that 

will improve farmer livelihoods and reduce environmental 

impacts. As smallholders are vulnerable to volatile market

While IndoAgri plasma smallholders benefit from support 

by nucleus estates to improve yields, most smallholders 

traditionally record lower yields. Smallholders are embraced 

by our Policy and our technical and financial support, which 

helps them avoid clearing primary forest. Our longstanding 

Smallholder Programme and related smallholder group 

certification project are in place to improve yields.

Plasma farmers eventually become a viable and independent 

business. Once they fully repay their loans from IndoAgri, 

they get management control and land title deeds. We 

provide assistance to the smallholder sector and we help 

KUDs with their financial management and Internal Control 

System (ICS). 

Our engagement with smallholders also involve training 

and workshop activities on sustainable palm oil. These 

include training programmes such as the Curriculum 

Preparation Workshop Training for Oil Palm Farmers in 

Sustainable Palm Oil Plantation conducted by Ekologika in 

September 2018. Similarly, another programme was held in 

Suka Damai Estate in December 2018 on Trial Ex-Plasma / 

Independent Farmer Training Manual for Sustainable Palm 

Oil Certification with participation of 20 farmers from KUD 

Teratai Biru. The programmes’ objective was to test the 

training curriculum tools, learning media and manuals for 

facilitators of training for ex-plasma / independent oil palm 

farmers in the context of sustainable palm oil certification.

food Safety

Our consumers rely on the IndoAgri brands for safe, high 

quality products that they can trust. We are dedicated 

to meeting consumers’ expectations. We have formal 

management processes throughout our operations that 

deliver our promise of high standards. Further, we have 

an experienced laboratory team that works on product 

formulations to meet the evolving needs of our customers.

IndoAgri’s Quality Control teams deliver our product quality 

assurance. Our production sites and suppliers are audited 

at least annually on hygiene and sanitation. To keep up with 

evolving food standards, our Quality Control teams undergo 

regular specialist training on hygiene, safety, and Halal risk 

and control. 

Our products provide carotenoid 

(for vitamin C) and tocopherol (for 

vitamin e) to ensure consumers 

achieve a balanced diet and to 

mitigate risk of vitamin deficiency.

Our products are fortified with essential 

vitamins. These vitamins strengthen 

the immune system, eyesight and 

the developing foetus in utero. These 

vitamins also improve cell development, 

enzymes and a healthy nervous system.

Our exported cooking oils to the 

Philippines are further enriched 

with vitamin A, as required by 

regulations in that market. 

Palm oil contains the right sorts of fat 

(saturated and unsaturated triglycerides) 

which promote healthy growth, supple 

skin and energy storage. Palm oil is free 

of cholesterol and trans-fat.

We take vitamin fortification beyond 

compliance. Whilst vitamins A and D 

are mandated by Indonesian law, as 

a manufacturer of high-quality food 

products, we aim to contribute to 

the healthy diet of Indonesians. For 

example, we have also added vitamins 

E, B1, B2, B3, B9 and B12 in our table

100% of our sites have now set up SMK3 (Sistem Manajemen 

Keselamatan dan Kesehatan Kerja), the Indonesian OHS 

standard. 34 sites (30 in Palm Oil) also achieved SMK3 Gold 

certification.

We conduct SMK3 refresher training across 100% of our sites 

every year. This is to ensure day-to-day SMK3 compliance of 

all our workers at their respective sites.

We regret to report that there were four work-related 

fatalities in 2018, all in our palm oil operations. Senior 

managers visited the bereaved, and victims are covered by 

Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial (BPJS), an Indonesian 

social security system. Every accident is followed by a 

thorough formal investigation, a review of causes and a 

preventive action plan.

Accident frequency rate (AFR) is calculated as follows: No. of Work Days 

Lost x 1,000,000 divided by Total Hours Worked (number of employees x 

40 hours x 50 weeks). Accident severity rate (ASR) is a calculation that 

gives a company an average of the number of lost days per recordable 

incident, recorded when an employee is referred to a clinic due to a 

workplace accident, and given leave of absence. In accordance with 

regulations, we count the accident if the lost day is more than one day.

We are particularly committed to the safety of employees 

harvesting or pruning near high tension electricity 

cables. Colleagues carrying out such high-risk tasks 

undergo special training, are required to follow specific 

technical procedures and are regularly monitored. 

Strictly controlled procedures include the following:

•	 Before	 work	 commences,	 proper	 coordination	

and a special approval from the estate manager 

is required which specifies Personal Protective 

Equipment (PPE), capital equipment used and 

names of employees 

•	 A	foreman	is	to	oversee	the	task	until	completion

•	 The	electricity	supply	must	be	turned	off

•	 No	work	is	allowed	under	wet	weather	conditions	

•	 A	 non-conductive	 bamboo	 pole	 must	 be	 used	 for	

harvesting

•	 PPE	must	be	appropriate	and	complete	e.g.	voltage

labour rightS and human rightS 

In 2018, no operations or suppliers were identified as 

having significant risk relating to collective bargaining, 

forced labour or child labour. IndoAgri employees benefit 

from a government pension, additional contributions from 

the company, and retirement packages (in agreement with 

the BPJS). 

Seasonal	Contract	Workers	

IndoAgri hire seasonal contract workers for weeding and 

peak season tasks. They are usually local and related to our 

full-time employees. The flexibility of seasonal agricultural 

work allows workers to tend to other activities such as 

juggling a variety of household jobs, or in other income 

generating activities such as cultivating their own crops and 

running cottage industry businesses.

The hiring of contract workers complies with government 

regulation using company procedures, Code of Conduct, our 

Sustainable Palm Oil Policy, and the latest Principles and 

Criteria of ISPO. Each seasonal worker’s contract respects 

government regulation and we ensure that they understand 

their rights and responsibilities. As it is our policy to ban non-

registered employees from working on our sites, all seasonal 

workers are registered by our Human Resource Department 

and logged onto the fingerprint recognition system. Depending 

on skills and job availability, our seasonal workers can be 

promoted as permanent workers to manage core roles.

against child labour

We strictly disallow those below age 18 from working at 

our sites. Based on our employee database, no registered 

IndoAgri worker is below age 18. 

We take proactive measures to prevent child labour from 

arising. As education is critical in drawing children away 

from fields, we provide free education to the children of 

our employees in estates with existing schools. Levels 

of education provided begin from kindergarten level to 

secondary school. As at end 2018, there are 161 schools and 

828 teachers on our plantations. We also provide day care 

facilities for children under five.

Signs and posters reminding workers not to bring children 

to the work area are placed in all our plantation sites. 

Employment contracts for all workers include a clause on 

disallowing children to help with agricultural production 

work. Warning letters will be issued to those who do not 

comply – this is incorporated into employment contracts. 

Diversity

In 2018, there were no incidents of discrimination reported 

via our whistle-blowing facility or to our Gender Committees. 

Jobs of new mothers are reserved while they are on maternity 

leave. During the reporting period, 359 women took maternity 

leave (2017: 194), 80% or 287 women returned to the same 

job position (60% in 2017). The rest remained on leave or 

chose to leave the company. 

Freedom of association 

All our workers have the liberty to register themselves directly 

with their preferred labour union and bargain collectively. As 

at end 2018, 62% (2017: 69%) of our operational employees 

were registered with a union, the remainder are covered 

by a company regulation known as Peraturan Perusahaan. 

We engage regularly with the labour unions of our workers 

PeoPle and community

gender committeeS in action  

Gender Committees aim to discuss issues concerning 

the protection of women such as complaint services, 

counselling and maternal/child health. A training 

session was held in North Sumatra in October 2018 to 

share information on the Committees’ role and extent. 

A Committee is in place in all work units to foster 

clear understanding of gender equality and to mediate 

problems faced by female workers. Male and female 

Committee members are equipped with knowledge of 

family nutrition and hygiene. The Committee plays an 

important role in maintaining and enhancing the role 

of women in estates, mills and households.

Our central clinic in Riau estate, which is level 1 BPJS-registered, provides health services to our employees and neighbouring communities

through bipartite meetings to discuss issues such as 

agreement on quota, wages etc. These bipartite meetings 

are attended by representatives of the company and all 

labour unions. One of the latest meetings was held in North 

Sumatra on 4th October 2018 to discuss mutual agreement 

on increases of premiums wages for harvesters and factory 

workers. Such dialogue sessions are conducted with the 

labour unions to achieve a favourable outcome for all and to 

avoid disputes. We believe there are no sites where the right 

to freedom of association is at significant risk. 

emPloyee welfare 

Through our Work and Estate Living Programme, we work 

with local governments and hospitals to provide essential 

medical support, facilities and infrastructure for the people 

living on our estates. Our projects focus on household 

hygiene, healthy living and free access to medical facilities. 

See page 52 for more data on education and medical facilities 

provided which employees and their dependents enjoy free of 

charge.

Minimum	wage	and	wage	slips

We ensure that all our employees are adequately 

compensated for their work. We are also in strict compliance 

with the minimum wage regulations set by the Government. 

In 2018, we continued to pay all our employees and workers 

within or above the minimum wages of their respective 

region. 

access to benefits

We comply with government regulation on equal access to 

employment benefits. Over the years, we have improved the 

benefits and incentives for all our employees and workers to 

improve job satisfaction and welfare across our operations. 

Other than competitive remuneration, we care for our 

employees through provisioning of housing, sports facilities, 

places of worship, educational institutions such as schools, 

medical facilities and amenities.

In compliance with the Indonesian Government regulation, 

we also register all our workers to the BPJS health and 

accident insurance scheme. The BPJS insurance is only 

available to workers with an electronic identity card (E-KTP). 

However, some of our workers remain unregistered 

because they lack an E-KTP. This is because those who do 

not yet have an E-KTP or have invalid E-KTP number are 

unable to register for it. In such cases, we help workers 

obtain the appropriate documentation and liaise with the 

relevant government units to facilitate registration.

Appropriate	workload

While daily quotas for harvesting are based on individual 

plantation characteristics and complexities, it is crucial for 

IndoAgri that the daily quota is achievable by our harvesters. 

Therefore, daily quotas are set based on mutual agreement 

between the company and respective labour unions with 

representation from workers. 

Update	 on	 the	 allegations	 related	 to	 labour	 and	

human rights

At IndoAgri we take all grievances and complaints very 

seriously and comply fully with any obligatory formal 

processes. In June 2016, three NGOs submitted a formal 

complaint alleging instances of labour violations at one of 

our subsidiaries. Between 2016 and 2018, we have had a 

total of 23 audits at the location in question in North Sumatra 

conducted by RSPO accredited independent auditors and 

Accreditation Services International (“ASI”). These audits 

confirm that we remain compliant with the RSPO Principles 

and Criteria. All audited sites remained compliant and 

certified, and there were no material findings to substantiate 

the allegations. We were naturally surprised at the findings 

of RSPO’s final audit report dated 23rd November 2018 which 

PeoPle and community

47

INDOFOOD	AGRI	RESOURCES	LTD

SuStainability REPORt 2018


stated that an audit carried out between 4-7 June 2018 were 

inconsistent with the 23 previous audits. 

Despite numerous requests for supporting evidence to 

substantiate the allegations, nothing beyond the initial report 

has been provided by the complainants. We committed to abide 

by the RSPO Complaints Process (CP) and receive feedback 

as part of our ongoing improvement processes. Overall we 

experienced a deep and disappointing lack of engagement 

by the RSPO CP and unrealistic timings related to responses 

expected of IndoAgri. For example, in December 2018, we 

openly sought advice from RSPO on selecting an external 

consultant to assist us;  instead of providing constructive 

feedback, RSPO insisted that we submit an Action Plan in 

an unrealistically short timeframe. Despite our steadfast 

efforts to engage with the RSPO CP since 2016 we decided 

to withdraw from RSPO and focus instead on implementing 

the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) certification. We 

add that in 2019, subsequent to our withdrawal from RSPO, 

the audit of our Turangie mill in North Sumatra confirmed 

compliance with RSPO requirements. 

A chronology of events including actions taken by IndoAgri 

and communication between IndoAgri and RSPO is available 

on our website. 

training and develoPment

Our various training and development modules are guided 

by Total Quality Management principles. These modules 

and initiatives seek to improve the career development, job 

satisfaction and welfare of our employees. We are pleased 

to report 6% of permanent employee turnover, which is a 

decrease compared to 8% 2017. See figures on training, 

turnover and new hires data on pages 51-52.

Since 2015, all employees from staff-level and above 

complete an annual performance review. This appraisal 

process allows us to reward and retain high performance 

and identify opportunities for improvement, with a focus 

on a competitive rewards package. It also helps implement 

the Balanced Scorecard to track against a target for each 

employee. The scorecard focuses on quality, cost, regulatory 

and social practice, as well as culture change and learning. 

community

As an agribusiness in rural Indonesia, we play a crucial role 

in the livelihood of the communities in which we operate. 

We aim to advance the socio-economic development of our 

farmers and suppliers, communities and families living in 

the vicinity of our operations. Besides providing employment 

opportunities to thousands living in remote areas, we 

continue to improve the quality of life in our nucleus 

and plasma estates through our Solidarity Programme. 

Through a range of education, health, infrastructure, micro-

enterprise, farmer training, culture and humanitarian living 

programmes, the outcome we want is empowered and 

resilient communities.

access to Healthcare

During the reporting period, we continued our ongoing 

initiatives for community welfare improvements for each 

site. Clinics and first aid posts are provided on every estate 

for workers and their families. Community Health Centres 

(‘Posyandu’) are also available in the wider community 

for maternal and infant health care. In 2018, we have 197 

medical clinics in our estates, and 206 Posyandu, supported 

by 277 midwives/nurses and 60 doctors. Routine activities in 

our Posyandu include monthly health checks, counselling, 

immunisation, and provision of nutritional supplements  

or food. 

land Rights

Managing land tenure systems in rural Indonesia can be 

complex as national laws and regulations overlap with 

customary laws, religious laws, inheritance systems, and 

the historic assertions of traditional ownership and rights. 

This legal framework creates confusion and may lead to 

abuse which affects land ownership and property. Despite 

the challenging operational environment, we remain 

steadfast in committing to respect the principles of FPIC, 

see also page 34. All our land transaction complies with 

Indonesian law and company policy.

We recognise the challenges surrounding land use, hence 

are focused on maximising the yield of our plantations. 

Please see page 34 about maximising yield to alleviate 

pressure on forests and reduce risk of conflicts over land 

rights.

SkillS alwayS under the SPotlight 

Our training and development programme is called 

‘Sharing Knowledge’. Delivered by our human resources 

team, it features workshops on interview methods, 

personal improvement and stress management. 

Special “Friday Sharing Sessions” in 2019 will also cover 

business processes, mental wellbeing, sustainability, 

behavioural skills and management techniques. The 

programme is an opportunity for employees to interact 

and bond with members of other departments as well 

as to discover new skills. The sessions are interactive 

and engaging and will increasingly be part of each 

employee’s routine. 

Another specialist programme called ‘Mapping 

Assessment’ allows our employees to enrich their 

career path and communicate directly with the 

Human Resource Department. The program helps our 

employees reflect on their achievements, increase 

motivation and maintain a ‘healthy competitiveness’ 

in achieving the targets set by the management for 

the staff.

cleft liP Surgery Programme

The cleft lip surgery programme represents a vital 

contribution to communities in Indonesia. The support 

is aimed at children with a cleft lip or cleft palate, 

usually aged between three months to two years as 

facial aesthetics and speech recovery are optimised. In 

collaboration with numerous hospitals and non-profit 

organisations, we facilitate all stages from searching 

for cases, pre-operation family counselling, pre-

operative examination, surgery, and post-operative 

care or speech therapy. In 2018, the team together 

with 42 volunteers delivered additional 130 surgeries 

on 112 patients. Since 2014, this programme has 

delivered 384 successful treatments to 342 children.

about thiS rePort

This sustainability report has been prepared in accordance 

with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core 

option. The report also complies with requirements of 

the SGX-ST Listing Rules Practice Note 7.6 Sustainability 

Reporting Guide. IndoAgri has not commissioned any 

third-party assurance on this report. We welcome your 

feedback or questions at sustainability@indofoodagri.com. 

Previous reports are available online at www.indofoodagri.

com. Please refer to page 55 of this report for the GRI 

Content Index. 

ScoPe and Profile

This report presents our sustainability performance for 

2018. The scope of this report covers our most dominant 

crop, oil palm, which occupies 83% of our total planted 

area. There is no significant change to the size, structure 

or ownership of our oil palm operations compared to 

the previous report.  The palm oil sustainability data 

is captured through our Sustainability Management 

Information System.

For environmental, health and safety, and responsible 

sourcing data, the scope of oil palm plantation, mill, and 

refinery operations covered has expanded. In this report, 

we include data from our ISPO- or PROPER-certified/

audited plantations and mills (previously only RSPO). 

These data cover:

•	 ISPO-certified/audited	plantations:	50	out	of	85	sites	

(2017: 39 sites)

•	 ISPO-	or	PROPER-certified/audited	mills:	20	out	of	26	

sites (2017: 17 sites)

•	 PROPER-certified/audited	refineries:	4	out	of	5	sites	

(2017: 4)

ISPO certification is a key tool to help deliver on our Policy 

goals on deforestation, land rights, peatland, burning, 

smallholders and human rights. 

In 2018, the capacity of our Surabaya edible oil refinery 

was increased to produce an additional 300,000 tonnes/

annum. 

The scope of palm oil GHG data for 2018 includes 11 mills 

and 30 estates (unchanged from 2017)

The financial and employee data refer to the whole Group 

(all commodity operations).
