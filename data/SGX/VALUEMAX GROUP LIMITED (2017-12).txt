Sustainability is the crux of the success of any enterprise, especially enterprises with the conviction to achieve triple 

bottomline, namely ‘People, Profit, Planet’, for the benefits of both private enterprise and society. 

At ValueMax Group Limited (“ValueMax” or the “Group”), we are committed to uphold the highest standards of Economic, 

Social and Governance (“ESG”) practices within our organisation. While we are taking our first steps in the sustainability 

journey, we have embraced our corporate social responsibility with conviction and fervour.

We believe our sustainable growth and success is only possible with the sustainable development of the communities we 

operate in, be it social, business or national communities.

Driving long term sustainability is our vision. Centred on our key material issues, we have charted a four pronged approach 

to our sustainable development roadmap. We will endeavour to set ourselves on the journey of achieving a good balance 

between financial growth and ESG performance.

Corporate social responsibility is in the DNA of our organisation. As a market leader in the moneylending industry, we 

demonstrate our commitment through the adoption of responsible lending practices. The Group is committed to complying 

with all applicable laws and regulations related to the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing. The Board 

expects all Group employees to be vigilant to prevent any illegal use of the Group’s products and services by money 

launderers, terrorists or those financing terrorist activities.

To reflect this commitment, the Group has developed a Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (“PMLTF”) 

Framework and the related procedures and controls by drawing on practices from other industries with significant PMLTF 

compliance activities.

In FY 2017, we have also been certified with Singapore Quality Class with Service niche by SPRING Singapore which is a 

testimony to our relentless quest to inculcate quality culture within our organisation.

Over the years, we have taken the lead to implement several major key initiatives such as embarking on the Singapore 

Environmental Council’s Eco-Shop programme to monitor our water and energy consumption and actively supporting 

community and education programmes such as Smile Mission 2017 and Singapore Management University’s Business 

Families Institute.

Moving forward, we believe that long term investment in human capital is the key to the long term sustainable success of 

ValueMax Group. Therefore, we are committed to invest in strengthening our staff training and development roadmap.

Economic Contribution to Society

At present, we operate 30 outlets in Singapore. Each outlet is operated by our team of professional valuers and operations 

staff, overseen by ValueMax’s Corporate Office. We manage our operations in accordance to our sustainability principles. 

We work closely with our management and operation staff to identify and consider any sustainability opportunities and risks 

that may arise.  

Sustainability trends such as climate change, resource scarcity and demographic changes shape the competitive 

environment in which companies like ValueMax operate by introducing long term sustainability opportunities and recognising 

risks. We therefore view our business performance beyond short term gains and financial bottomline. Our conviction is 

to achieve a balanced triple bottomline in ‘People, Profit, Planet’ for sustainable growth both for the organisation and the 

community it operates in.

The success of our business is highly dependent on the commitment of our management and staff. Their knowledge, 

professional expertise and their job satisfaction are key to our economic sustainability.  

More importantly, we strive to contribute positively to the society through our economic presence by contributing to the range 

of short to medium term credit facilities to individuals and corporations, while maintaining good stewardship of the resources 

we manage and generate good shareholders’ value.

Our business model focuses on cost leadership without compromising our service level and highest priority on customer’s 

interest.  We seek organic growth from the existing outlets as well as through the acquisition of new businesses that reap 

good returns.

We strive to maintain our market position by ensuring we gain the trust of our customers and their families, while consistently 

building our reputation and brand name in the pawnbroking, gold trading, jewellery retailing as well as alternative financial 

industry.    

In today’s highly volatile business environment, ValueMax has, beyond sustained earnings, diligently embraced prudent 

financial management, capitalised on our assets and investments, and remained focused on growth strategies, to enhance 

shareholders’ value.

For more information on ValueMax’s financial and business performance, please refer to Annual Report FY2017.

With zero-tolerance policy on bribery and corruption, we have in place effective monitoring and management control 

systems to detect bribery, fraud or other malpractice activities directly at the source. We have established a whistle-

blowing mechanism for employees and any other concerned stakeholders such as customers and their families, suppliers, 

competitors and contractors.  

A direct whistle-blowing channel has also been implemented to enable our employees to get direct access to our Chariman 

of Audit Committee. By doing so, our stakeholders can be assured that all reports or suspicion of potential breaches 

of our Employee guidelines are taken seriously by the Group. Our stakeholders can also reach our Executive Director, 

Ms Yeah Lee Ching, via telephone or email.

Ethics and Integrity  

 

Anti-Corruption and Anti-Fraud

Legal Compliance and Corporate Governance

We promote an ethical and ‘act with integrity’ culture throughout the Group and our outlets. We seek to conduct our 

business in an ethical manner and in compliance with the best practices in the money-lending industry. All Directors, valuers, 

operations and management staff are required to fully comply with our principles set in our Employee Handbook and 

employment contract.

The Employee Handbook details our expected standards of employee’s professional behaviour towards our business 

partners whom we have business dealings with, to the people in the society whom we serve as patients and towards each 

other as employees of the Company. Above all, we are inculcated with strong corporate values to act with integrity.   

Corporate governance and compliance have always been one of the top priorities for the Company. The decision-making 

process in the Company is strictly in line with legal and regulatory requirements under the  Ministry of Law and in compliance 

with the Code of Corporate Governance issued by Monetary Authority of Singapore and the guidelines of the Monetary 

Authority of Singapore.  

ValueMax Group is a member of Singapore Pawnbrokers Association and Moneylenders Association of Singapore.

The Company has not received any correspondences or notifications in relation to any non-compliance of legal and 

regulatory requirements or the Code of Corporate Governance from any government and regulatory agencies in FY2017. The 

Audit Committee received no whistle-blowing letters during the year.

ValueMax Group Limited | Sustainability Report 2017 12


Compliance with Laws and Regulations

Responsible Lending and Anti-Money Laundering

The Group is proactive in ensuring its compliance with all relevant laws and regulations. Our management team is responsible 

to review and monitor the Group’s policies and practices in respect to legal and regulatory requirements across all clinics. 

Any non-compliance of the relevant laws and regulations and the proposed resolutions will be reported to the Board of 

Directors on a quarterly basis.    

The Group has put in place policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the relevant laws and regulations, particularly 

those relating to Pawnbrokers Act and Moneylenders Act. At corporate level, we also ensure that we are in compliance, both 

in substance and in spirit, with the Listing rules of SGX-ST, Securities and Futures Act and Singapore Companies Act.  

Any new enactment of or changes to the relevant laws and regulations will be communicated to all operations and 

management staff via emails and small group meetings. Such communication is necessary to ensure that all staff are aware 

of the changes and can carry out the necessary steps and actions to ensure compliance.  

While we seek to leverage our data to serve our customers responsibly, we adhere and uphold the Personal Data Protection 

Act (“PDPA”). We have put in place policies to ensure we are in compliance with PDPA and we respect our customers’ 

choices in respect of their personal data and the protection of our customers’ privacy.  

The main purpose for which their personal data is collected by ValueMax in Singapore is to furnish our customers with 

our products and services information, record their credit loans and their accounts, process payments, address questions 

and feedbacks, improve our products and services, as well as where permitted under law, send them our marketing and 

promotional offers on products and services, as well as personalised content and advertising based on their preferences and 

demographics. 

Unlike unsecured moneylending, secured lending will not create a negative networth position for the borrower. ValueMax has 

established policies and procedures to manage risks for its moneylending business, the pawnbroking business, gold trading 

business as well as its retail business.

The Group is committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations related to the prevention of money laundering 

and terrorism financing, and to deterring customers, suppliers, borrowers and pawners from using ValueMax as a conduit for 

illegal activity. The Board expects all Group employees to be vigilant to prevent any illegal use of the Group's products and 

services by money launderers, terrorists or those financing terrorist activities.

To reflect this commitment, the Company has developed a Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (PMLTF) 

Framework and the related procedures and controls by drawing on best practices from related financial industries with 

significant PMLTF compliance activities.

The objectives of this Framework are:

• To protect the Group from having its products and services used by money launderers, terrorists and  

   parties that finance terrorist activities;

• To protect the reputation of the Group;

• To achieve compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements;

• To identify and adopt strong, risk-based industry practices in relation to PMLTF.

Risk Management

Supply Chain and Procurement Practices

Service Quality and Responsibility

The Group recognises the importance of risk management and how business risks may adversely affect ValueMax’s business 

performance. Since 2013, we started our Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) framework to roll out a systematic approach 

to identify, assess and manage risks.  We are pleased to update all stakeholders that our ERM framework is now fully 

implemented.

While it is the responsibility of the Audit Committee, as delegated by the Board of Directors, to oversee the effectiveness of 

our risk management and internal controls, the core function of the ERM framework is coordinated by our Chief Financial 

Officer who reports to the Audit Committee on a periodic basis. 

For further details on Risk Management, please refer to corporate governance section of Annual Report FY2017.

Our supply chain constitutes mainly the suppliers for our gold trading business as well as the retail business for all our 30 

outlets. We have maintained a strong partnership with the suppliers for our gold and jewellery.

We believe in transparency in our supply chain and our approach is to positively engage with suppliers if we identify any 

issues. Any non-compliance with the guidelines of local and international regulatory bodies will result in us not embarking on 

the procurement and business relationship with them.

For an alternative financial service provider like ValueMax, our service quality and 

responsibility to our customers rank high for the sustainable success of the Group. We are 

committed to provide fair valuation of the valuables our customers bring to our chain of 

outlets and we emphasise on service excellence for every customer.   

Our valuers and professional staff serve our customers professionally and ethically. We will 

advise our customers on the valuation of their collaterals based on the current market price 

as well as the terms of their contracts. 

We were a member of CaseTrust which is the accreditation arm of the Consumers 

Association of Singapore (“CASE”), and Singapore’s de facto standard for companies who 

wish to demonstrate their commitment to fair trading and transparency to consumers.

There is no incident of  non-compliance with laws and regulations in the social and 

economic area.

There has been no incidence of product and service misinformation, mis-labelling or inapproprate marketing communications.

Water and Energy Conservation

Paper Usage

We believe our business has low impact on the environment. Nevertheless, we strive to embrace environmental sustainability 

by managing environmental conservation through adopting waste minimisation, recycling and energy effcient practices.  

We have installed LED lightings at our headquarter and our new outlets as our first step towards our energy conservation.

As our working environment is largely retail and office settings, we have collaborated with Singapore Environmental 

Council (“SEC”) in embarking on the Eco-shop programme in three of our 30 outlets in Singapore. The project aligns our 

environmental performance in our three outlets to key evaluation criterion like indoor environment and air quality, resource 

recovery and recycling, water and energy conservation.

Target

We have plans to roll out the same programme to our head office in 2018.

We tap on the water supply provided by Public Utilities Board and disposed used water into the public sewage system.

While we take conscientious efforts to conserve water and electricity, we are currently reviewing our utilisation rates and will 

implement measures to reduce the utilisation rates.

We have launched our Go-Green initiatives across all our outlets and Corporate Office. The implemented initiatives aim to 

encourage the ‘Reduce’, ‘Re-use’, and ‘Recycle’ of papers through the following ways:    

• ‘Reduce’ the use of papers by sending the printers to print on double-sides of each piece of paper and print only when  

 necessary. 

• ‘Re-use’ single-side printed papers for non-conﬁdential and draft documents. We plan to roll out electronic and paperless  

 daily operations reports.

• We are committed to use paper from sustainable sources where possible.

 We are looking into recycling all used papers, printed materials and collaterals by donating to authorised recycling  

 companies.

Identifying, recognising and rewarding performance in employees is essential in our hiring and retention strategy. We 

advocate fair employment practices by ensuring equal opportunities for recruitment, fair compensation, career progression 

and training opportunities. We provide fair employment opportunities to all, regardless of age, gender, race, or nationality. 

ValueMax advocates a policy of harnessing diversity in human resource as evidenced by a fair distribution of employees from 

varied nationalities and age groups to support our key markets in Singapore and Malaysia. 

We advocate gender diversity in our Board, with one female director among our 6 Board members, Ms Yeah Lee Ching.

There is a fair proportion of gender ratio between the male and female employees. We ensure that fair work practices and 

remuneration are ascertained based on individual work performance and not on any gender consideration. No form of 

discrimination is tolerated within our organisation. There is no incidence of discrimination reported and corrective actions 

taken during the year.

We maintain a policy of employee diversity through providing employment opportunities to both young and older workers 

above 55 years old. As at 31 December 2017, the youngest staff is 21 years old while we have 2 senior staff of age 70 and 

above.

Age Profile of Employees

The recruitment and retention of talents include cooperation with professional institutions, talent pool development and 

retention, and staff grievance mechanism.

In terms of employee skills profile, we have maintained a fair proportion of professional and management team to lead and 

drive the business growth in our four business segments.

Our business is dependent on senior experienced staff who have been in the pawnbroking business for over 10-20 years. 

Through the acquisition of new businesses over the years, we have also retained the workforce of the acquired entities 

and strengthened our pool of senior valuers whose professional expertise in valuables assessment has been critical in the 

sustainable success of our pawnbroking business.

We are continuously recruiting talents, particularly younger talents and grooming them through mentorship and on-the-job 

training programme.

Our recruitment policy is based on meritocracy and the pre-requisite skills and academic qualiﬁcations required to perform 

the required job scope. During recruitment, we have implemented stringent shortlisting process to ensure we recruit people 

with the same values as we do.  

We focus on retention of talents by providing fair and sustainable ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial incentives, and learning and 

development opportunities. Our compensation and beneﬁts policies are determined by guidelines proposed by our Human 

Resource and approved by our Management team or our Board. All our staff undergo annual performance review and 

receive periodic performance feedback from their reporting managers.

Employee Wellness and Benefits

The Company contributes to the Central Provident Fund Scheme and provides medical beneﬁts such as hospitalisation &amp; 

surgical plans for all employees. We provide maternity as well as paternity leave in accordance to the recommendations of 

the Ministry of Manpower of Singapore (“MOM”).

In 2017, we have recruited 6 employees due to the acquisition of 2 new outlets and encountered a turnover rate of 9%.

Apart from providing fair and sustainable ﬁnancial incentives to our employees, we also strive to create a culture of learning 

organisation through the following ways:

• Mentorship 

We have a strong culture of mentorship throughout our organisation. Our senior management leads and develops the 

organisation in achieving the goals and vision of the Group. Our senior valuers provide guidance and professional support, 

on-the-job training and coaching to our junior valuers.  

• Training and Skills Upgrading Opportunities  

We are constantly developing our employees through providing regular feedback and trainings. We believe that everyone 

needs to know what are the areas they need to improve on, and for those with high potential, career tracks are developed 

to give them a career roadmap of where they can advance progressively within ValueMax. Trainings such as conference and 

courses relating to their work are critical to equip our employees with up-to-date professional knowledge and skills in serving 

our customers and their families, and to support one another in ValueMax.

Target

We target to increase our average training hours per employee by 10% in the next 3 years.

We offer equal opportunities for skills training and career development for all employees and this has contributed to our high 

staff retention rate of 91% in 2017.

 development andﬁnance.
