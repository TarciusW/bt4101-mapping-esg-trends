We, Yanlord Land Group Limited, and together with our 

subsidiaries reaffirm our commitment towards sustainability 

with the publication of our fourth annual sustainability report. 

This report aims to provide stakeholders a holistic and 

transparent account of our sustainability approach, initiatives, 

and performance in the environmental, social, and governance 

(“ESG”) aspects. 

In this report, the terms “we”, “us”, “our”, “Company”, 

“Group”, and “Yanlord” refer to Yanlord Land Group Limited 

and, where relevant, its subsidiaries. 

For the financial year ended 31 December 2020 (“FY2020”), 

we made several key updates to our sustainability reporting 

practices.

• 

We expanded our scope of coverage following our 

acquisition of United Engineers Limited (“UEL”)’s property-

related businesses in Singapore and the People’s Republic 

of China (“PRC”) in 2020. 

• 

We reassessed, consolidated, and aligned our material ESG 

topics with UEL’s following the acquisition.

• 

We conducted a materiality reassessment that took into 

consideration the growing expectations of both internal and 

external stakeholders. 

• 

We improved the coverage of ESG disclosures, by matching 

against leading practices, the requirements and guide 

set out in the Listing Manual of the Singapore Exchange 

Securities Trading Limited (“Listing Manual”), and industry 

benchmarks such as MSCI ESG Ratings. 

• 

We mapped our sustainability practices to the United 

Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

• 

We reorganised our sustainability governance structure by 

enhancing accountability of stakeholders at each level and 

formalising the upward reporting channel.

ABOUT THIS REPORT

Keeping in line with the expectations of our internal and 

external stakeholders, we have structured this report in 

accordance with the materiality reassessment. Topics that were 

found to be of greater importance to our stakeholders have 

been prioritised in the reading order of this report.

From our materiality assessment, our stakeholders are most 

interested in our corporate governance structures, the quality 

of products and services we offer, how we take care of our 

employees, the part we play in addressing climate change 

and managing climate risks, as well as how we give back to 

the communities we operate in. In this report, we are pleased 

to present more information on our policies, practices, 

performances and targets in these areas to our stakeholders. 

This report should be read together with our Annual Report for 

FY2020 (“Annual Report 2020“) for a comprehensive view of 

our businesses and performance.

REPORTING SCOPE AND PERIOD 

This report showcases our performance from 1 January 2020 

to 31 December 2020 with prior year, the financial year ended 

31 December 2019 (“FY2019”), as comparison where possible. 

The reporting scope covers our main business segments 

namely: Property Development, Property Investment and Hotel 

Operations as well as Property Management in PRC, Singapore 

and Hong Kong (SAR), unless otherwise stated. For FY2020, we 

have also expanded our reporting scope to include the related 

business segments of UEL.

Financial data is given in Renminbi (“RMB”).

REPORTING STANDARDS

This report has been prepared in accordance with the Global 

Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core Option and the 

sustainability reporting requirements set out in the Listing 

Manual. In addition, we have also included the GRI G4 

Construction and Real Estate Sector Disclosures in this report. 

The GRI Standards were selected as it is an internationally 

recognised reporting framework, comprising a comprehensive 

range of disclosures suitable for Yanlord to address its 

socioeconomic and environmental impacts. Additionally, a 

majority of organisations listed on the Singapore Exchange 

have also chosen the GRI Standards as the framework for their 

sustainability reporting, which allows for ease of comparison 

among our peers and the industry.

INTRODUCTION AND 

LEADERSHIP STATEMENT

BOARD STATEMENT

 

We as members of Yanlord Land Group Limited’s Board of 

Directors (the “Board”) stand by the belief that the success of 

the business hinges upon integration of sustainability in our 

Group’s long-term strategies and incorporation of sustainability 

initiatives and goals throughout our business where possible. 

Cognisant of the impacts our business may have on the 

environment as well as the communities we operate in, we 

have established a sustainability governance structure which 

ensures robust oversight and management of sustainability 

throughout our Group. On 26 February, 2021, we renamed 

our Risk Management Committee at the Board level to “Risk 

Management and Sustainability Committee” to better reflect 

the then existing duties and functions of this Committee, and to 

reaffirm our commitment and efforts towards sustainability, the 

ESG factors that are material and pertinent to our business as 

well as our approach to sustainability reporting in ensuring that 

there is an appropriate focus on sustainability by management.

While the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about significant 

disruptions globally, it has also provided us the opportunity to 

rethink and relook at our existing sustainability practices. 

Our report this year improves on our previous years’ 

reports through a wider reporting scope and more detailed 

disclosures. In doing so, we carefully considered the regulatory 

requirements, new demands of the market, stakeholders’ 

feedback as well as our past ESG ratings. We also conducted 

a formal materiality reassessment in FY2020 with an external 

consultant. This exercise takes into consideration an extensive 

desktop study of our existing sustainability practices and that of 

our peers as well as development in the sustainability reporting 

space and changing trends within the real estate industry. 

Inputs from various internal and external stakeholders were 

sought.

From the materiality reassessment, we identified 5 new 

ESG topics, compared to FY2019 namely, Anti-corruption 

and Business Ethics, Green Buildings, Climate Change, 

Employment and Training, and finally, Local Community and 

Social Investment. These 5 new topics were chosen with 

a holistic approach to ESG in mind; we are committing to 

improving our ESG disclosures and practices throughout our 

businesses. At the recommendation of our Risk Management 

and Sustainability Committee, we have determined a total of 

10 material ESG topics that are pertinent to the business of our 

Group for FY2020. 

We will continue to review our existing as well as potential ESG 

topics on an annual basis to ensure their continued relevance to 

our businesses. Through active and regular engagement with our 

stakeholders, we also strive to keep ourselves updated of their key 

concerns so as to provide appropriate responses which will in turn 

guide us in managing our material ESG topics. In addition, with 

the reorganised sustainability governance structure, we are able to 

oversee and ensure the appropriateness of the management and 

monitoring of material ESG topics more efficiently.  

As our businesses continue to diversify and journey towards 

sustainability advances, we encourage all stakeholders to join us 

and cultivate the seeds of sustainability for our future generation.

OUR APPROACH TO 

SUSTAINABILITY

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE

In FY2020, we reorganised our sustainability governance 

structure to reflect our continued efforts towards integrating 

sustainability across our business practices. It also aims to 

enhance accountability of stakeholders at each level, increase 

overall awareness of sustainability and drive relevant efforts 

across our Group.  

The four-tier sustainability governance structure begins at 

the top with the Board, which is ultimately responsible for 

Yanlord’s sustainability reporting. They maintain oversight on 

the business affairs and strategic directions of our Group as well 

as determining the material ESG topics pertinent to the Group’s 

business on an annual basis. The Board is supported by the Risk 

Management and Sustainability Committee which ensures there 

is an appropriate focus on sustainability by management. They 

oversee our ESG Management Committee which comprises 

members of senior management personnel who formulate 

and supervise the policies and initiatives relating to Yanlord’s 

material ESG topics. Together with our ESG Task Force, the 

respective sustainability practices will be cascaded across the 

respective departments and communicated to stakeholders. 

Our ESG Management Committee provides periodical updates 

on our Group’s sustainability performance in an upwards 

manner to our Risk Management and Sustainability Committee 

which will then present the information to the Board for their 

review and approval.

OUR APPROACH TO 

SUSTAINABILITY

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

At Yanlord, we take into consideration our stakeholders’ key 

concerns and strive to deliver value through our business 

operations. In light of the changing business environment as 

well as the impacts brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, 

we have embarked on a materiality reassessment in FY2020. 

Through this rigorous four-step process, we are able to identify 

key issues pertinent to our business and the impact we have on 

the environment we operate in. This process is illustrated in the 

table on the right: 

1

Identification

Phases

Action Taken

Review

Facilitated by external sustainability consultants, a list of potential material topics was identified 

through a series of desktop research which took into consideration:  

• existing material ESG topics in our previous sustainability reports 

• peers’ latest sustainability reports

• Singapore Exchange’s Sustainability Reporting Guide

• Hong Kong Exchange’s ESG Reporting Guide

• MSCI ESG Industry Database

Based on this review, it resulted in an initial list of 26 potential sustainability topics for prioritisation.

This listing was then further refined based on: 

• the frequency of selection by peers, the weightage accorded to the topic by MSCI ESG 

assessments, and recommendations made by our management team. This narrowed down 

the list to the top 15 potential topics.

• an anonymous voting exercise was conducted where various internal (management and 

employees) and external stakeholders (investors, customers/tenants and business partners) 

ranked the potential ESG topics taking into account their impact to themselves as well as to 

Yanlord’s businesses.

Results of the prioritisation phase is showcased in the materiality matrix in Figure 3. The top 

10 ESG topics were reviewed by the Risk Management and Sustainability Committee and 

subsequently presented to the Board for validation and approval.

Review of our material ESG topics will be done on an annual basis to ensure their continued 

relevance and significance to our Group.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS 

In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly announced 17 Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”) to address global challenges in social, 

environmental, governance and economic aspects. These 17 goals and 169 sub-targets serve to guide nations on adopting the SDGs so as to 

achieve them by 2030. In line with our commitment towards sustainability, we have conducted a high-level mapping to determine the SDGs 

which Yanlord can make an impact on. We have adopted nine most relevant SDGs and have mapped our corresponding material topics in the 

table below.

OUR APPROACH TO 

SUSTAINABILITY

SUSTAINABILITY IN OUR VALUE CHAIN 

OUR VALUE CHAIN 

 

To support our vast and diversified business, we rely on the 

capabilities of our employees as well as engage with various 

business partners within our value chain. Across PRC, Singapore 

and Hong Kong (SAR), we work with three main types of 

suppliers, contractors and vendors who provide services related 

to construction¹, consultancy2, and product³ such as construction 

for our property development projects, maintenance and repair 

works, cleaning, security and housekeeping operations across 

our investment properties and hotels.

We believe that good sustainability governance should 

include incorporating sustainable business practices across 

our value chain. Currently, we consciously choose to use 

more environmental friendly materials where possible, for 

instance by using water-based paint instead of oil-based 

paints where possible. Additionally, in selecting suppliers to 

work with, one of our criteria is how they are benchmarked 

against their peers in terms of corporate governance and 

environmental protection. We also aim to include our business 

partners in our sustainability journey by encouraging our 

business partners to commit to socially and environmentally 

responsible practices in their dealings. With a holistic 

approach to sustainability governance, the maintenance 

and creation of positive stakeholder relationships based on 

respect for the environment and local communities in the 

countries we operate in, we believe that we can achieve the 

creation of shared value for the long term.

1 

Construction service suppliers include general contractors and subcontractors 

for labour-intensive work. The contract amounts are relatively large.

2 

Consultancy service suppliers include design institutes, project supervisors, cost 

consultations, bidding agencies, etc. for labour-intensive work. We generally 

partner small businesses, and the contract amounts are relatively small. 

3 

Product service suppliers include suppliers of materials and equipments, etc.  

It is partly capital-intensive.

OUR APPROACH TO 

SUSTAINABILITY

COVID-19 RESPONSE 

IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS 

Although we were inevitably affected by the impact of city 

lockdowns and border closures on performance and outlook of 

global economies, we were able to quickly resume our business 

activities.  In PRC, where our main business operations are 

located, all of our offices and sales centres were able to resume 

work and operations progressively from late February 2020, and 

all construction sites followed suit by April 2020.

In Singapore, some of our businesses were deemed essential 

services and therefore continued operating during the 

Circuit Breaker period from 7 April 2020 till 1 June 2020. 

Thereafter, we could gradually resume on-site property sales 

and construction activities with safe reopening of the country 

through phases beginning 2 June 2020 onwards. This was in 

line with the Singapore government’s progressive relaxation of 

lockdown measures.

SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITY 

When the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, our Chairman and 

Chief Executive Officer immediately issued an open letter to 

remind our employees to take personal protective measures, 

and instructed the Property Management team along with 

the site management staff to cooperate fully with the local 

government in putting protective measures in place. At the 

same time, he promised that we would actively provide various 

forms of assistance to the community when appropriate. 

We made sure to deliver on that promise. At the Group and 

City levels, we contributed to the prevention of community 

spread of coronavirus by enhancing local public health 

equipment and strengthening protective measures at Yanlord’s 

communities. In addition, member companies of our Group 

purchased medical equipment for use in heavily affected cities 

in Hubei, including Wuhan, in PRC. In total, RMB 1.71 million 

was used to purchase medical equipment such as ventilators, 

medical-grade gloves, and infrared induction thermometers, 

to support frontliners. 

During the height of the pandemic, we learnt that 28 

households among our Group’s property owners in PRC 

(specifically in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Nanjing, and Suzhou) had 

family members who were medical staff urgently called to 

the frontline of the pandemic in Hubei, PRC. The respective 

city offices took care of the heroes’ families by providing 

assistance to each household and allocated RMB 20,000 to 

each household as an expression of our support and respect. 

At Yanlord communities, we strictly followed government 

instructions and reinforced entry and exit security. Additionally, 

we implemented various sanitation and disinfection measures, 

publicised health and safety guidelines and conducted 

surveys of internal movements. Due to the high population 

of foreigners living in Yanlord’s communities, the Property 

Management staff provided service support for those under 

quarantine. Our communities showed a high level of trust 

in our Property Management team; more than 500 property 

owners at Four Seasons Gardens in Nantong, PRC entrusted 

spontaneously raised  donations of over RMB 100,000 for us 

to present to the families of those fighting on the frontlines of 

the pandemic. 

To support tenants at Yanlord-owned shopping malls, we 

adopted various measures to reduce the burden of their 

operating costs, forgiving rent of approximately  

RMB 9.23 million throughout the year. 

Past the critical period of the COVID-19 pandemic and 

upon resumption of economic activities, our Chengdu office 

contributed to the formulation of the “Prevention and Control 

of Epidemics in Commercial Office Buildings” standards, 

which received affirmation from the state media. Additionally, 

our Product Research and Development team is currently 

working hard at developing improved hygiene and air 

ventilation solutions for our properties.

UPHOLDING GOOD 

GOVERNANCE

We are committed to achieving high standards of corporate 

governance and transparency within our business operations, 

and have complied in all material respects with the principles 

and provisions in the Code of Corporate Governance (“2018 

Code”). The Corporate Governance Statement on pages 189 

to 217 of our Annual Report 2020 outlines our Company’s 

corporate governance practices with specific reference to the 

principles and provisions set out in the 2018 Code.

ANTI-CORRUPTION AND BUSINESS ETHICS

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

Yanlord bears zero tolerance towards any form of corruption 

and unethical behaviour. At Yanlord, our Audit Committee and 

the Risk Management and Sustainability Committee, supported 

by our Internal Audit (“IA”) department, assists the Board to, 

inter alia, oversee the internal controls, risk management and 

sustainability-related matters including but not limited to anti-

corruption and business ethics issues. Our IA performs regular 

and ad hoc internal audits on all functions within our Group, 

and reports the respective findings to our Audit Committee 

and our Risk Management and Sustainability Committee, 

respectively. 

To complement the internal audit works performed by the 

IA, the Risk Control and Management (“RCM”) department, 

comprising members from both Group and subsidiary 

levels, monitors and ensures that the business and operation 

processes of our Group are run properly. Both findings from 

IA and RCM are communicated to the management of the 

respective departments, subsidiaries or Group for necessary 

improvement, which are then summarised in reports and 

tabled/circulated to our Audit Committee and/or our Risk 

Management and Sustainability Committee, as the case may 

be, by our IA for review on a periodical basis.

Our Board will have a final review and approval on such reports, 

at the recommendation of our Audit Committee or our Risk 

Management and Sustainability Committee. In the event the 

finding is material, our IA shall report to the Audit Committee 

and/or our Risk Management and Sustainability Committee 

(and our Board) on an immediate basis.

We have a comprehensive management system which 

comprises a suite of policies and procedures aimed at 

preventing incidences of corruption, unethical business 

means or misconduct across our business operations. This 

management system references the ISO 37001 – Anti-bribery 

management systems standards which details the eight major 

control measures. The system further encourages the inclusion 

of fraud, cartel, competition, and money-laundering control 

measures which are not within the scope of ISO 37001. The 

system also incorporates elements adopted from the Hong 

Kong (SAR)’s Independent Commission Against Corruption 

Framework.

Examples of Policies, Manuals and Documentation 

including but not limited to 

• 

Code of Business Conduct

• 

Group Tendering Management Policy

•

Upon induction, all new hires will have to undergo a 

mandatory training on the Code of Business Conduct (the 

“Code”) which details our expectations and guidelines 

pertaining to confidentiality, work and conduct discipline, 

giving and receiving corporate gifts as well as concessionary 

offers. 

Employees are also informed of the procedures to take 

should they encounter suspected cases of misconduct such 

as workplace harassment or any other improprieties and the 

respective channels to raise such issues or grievances during 

the course of their employment. Upon completion of the 

course, they are required to sign off and acknowledge their 

understanding of the Code. The Code is publicly available  

on our website for all stakeholders to access at 

http://www.yanlordland.com/corporate-governance/. All other 

manuals and documents are available on Yanlord’s intranet for 

employees’ reference. 

Likewise, the same expectations on anti-corruption and 

anti-bribery are imposed for our contractors, vendors and 

suppliers. Prior to an engagement, all vendors and suppliers 

will have to read and acknowledge on our business contracts 

which details our zero-tolerance approach towards corruption 

and bribery, as well as the relevant practices. Suppliers are 

also required to provide documentation and validate that the 

products and services rendered are from credible sources and 

meet the required quality thresholds set by Yanlord. From 

here, we aim to instill a clean corporate culture and ensure 

business is conducted in a responsible and ethical manner.

By FY2022, we will aim for all employees and our business 

partners to sign off and acknowledge the Code. During 

FY2020, we are pleased to report that there were no 

breaches against the Code, a performance we aim to 

maintain.

We are pleased to report that there were no confirmed cases of fraud, corruption and unethical actions in FY2020. 

Through regular industry benchmarking studies, risk analysis and research, we keep ourselves updated with latest developments so 

as to strengthen our risk control measures. In FY2020, we have made the following enhancements aimed at reducing risk of fraud 

and corruption within our procurement processes.

RAISING 

CONCERNS

REVIEW AND

INVESTIGATION

OUTCOME 

OF REVIEW

Reporting of incidents or concerns 

can be raised via email or mail to our 

IA in Hong Kong.

To facilitate investigation, the whistle-

blower should provide specific 

and factual information whenever 

possible.

Every effort will be made to protect 

the complainant’s identity and shall 

be kept strictly confidential, unless 

required by law or regulations.

All cases received are reviewed by 

our IA and the details of the cases are 

recorded in the Complaints Register. 

Where cases are confirmed, the IA 

will report to the Audit Committee 

accordingly.

The Audit Committee decides on 

the appropriate response in the 

best interests of the Group which 

can include conducting further 

investigation, involving relevant key 

management staff to take remedial 

action as well as engaging external 

experts/advisors (if needed) in the 

course of the investigation.

Following the investigation, a formal 

report will be submitted to Audit 

Committee.

The Audit Committee shall review 

the report and advise and authorise 

the relevant department to take the 

appropriate actions in respect of the 

investigated incident (if applicable).

WHISTLE-BLOWING MECHANISM

Our Whistle-Blowing Policy provides an avenue for employees 

of our Group and any other persons to raise concerns about 

possible improprieties or malpractices. These concerns can 

include any activity, breach of business conduct and ethics or 

omission by an employee, or any issues regarding financial 

reporting, accounting or auditing, internal controls or internal 

accounting controls and other operational matters which could 

have a material impact on our Group. The Whistle-Blowing 

Policy provides that employees or any other persons who report 

a concern in good faith will be accorded adequate protection 

from reprisals or victimisation, so that they do not need to fear 

obstructive action or retaliatory action as a result of their report.

CASE STUDY: 

LEVERAGING ON TECHNOLOGY – SUNSHINE PROCUREMENT 

PLATFORM

A significant pain point for the real estate industry is how to prevent fraud 

and corruption during the tendering process. We conducted continuous 

assessments and identified common frauds that may emerge during this 

process, such as fraudulent qualifications used in bidding, bid rigging, 

violation of laws and regulations, etc. 

In order to mitigate these risks and enhance transparency, Yanlord 

launched the Sunshine Procurement Platform in March 2020. A combined 

effort led by our Group Procurement, Group IT, RCM and Design 

departments, the platform covers procurement related to engineering and 

construction, material and equipment, as well as design. With our Sunshine 

Procurement Platform, we can now consolidate our reviews and approvals 

of the entire procurement process and documentation, thus improving our 

ability to prevent fraud and corruption risks through close monitoring.

We met our target of no reported incidents of corruption or 

unethical business in FY2020.

TARGET AND PERFORMANCE

In FY2020, we have achieved our target of zero significant 

fines and non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance 

relating to laws and regulations, including environmental and 

socioeconomic compliance – a performance we aim to upkeep.

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND 

REGULATIONS 

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

Yanlord is committed to complying with all applicable laws 

and regulatory requirements in the countries we operate in. 

This enables us to maintain our licences to operate in our 

various markets, and to effectively manage the risks associated 

with our activities. We have identified applicable laws and 

regulatory obligations in PRC, Singapore and Hong Kong 

(SAR) which include but are not limited to building standards, 

labour practices, workplace health and safety, data privacy and 

environmental protection.  Instances of non-compliance may 

bring about detrimental impacts to our reputation as well as 

financial repercussions. 

A shared responsibility lies among the various functions as they 

interact with the respective regulatory bodies during their day-

to-day operations. The respective business functions regularly 

monitor updates and changes with laws and regulations and 

make necessary updates to existing processes to remain within 

regulated boundaries. Such changes are communicated to the 

Board and relevant stakeholders as required. 

Additionally, internal checks are conducted regularly by our 

IA. Findings are reported to the Board on a quarterly basis.  

Employees are also sent for training to keep informed of such 

regulatory changes and encouraged to learn and adopt leading 

practices, and apply them during the course of their work at 

Yanlord.

The onset of COVID-19 has brought about a stringent set 

of rules and legislations. Across our operating regions, we 

adhere strictly to the COVID-19 regulations as mandated 

by the respective governments, its agencies and local 

health authorities. Precautionary measures such as social 

distancing, mandatory use of masks and increased frequency 

of disinfection have been implemented since the start and 

continue to be practised.

At Yanlord, we consistently prioritise the needs and 

expectations of our customers and consider their well-being 

throughout the stages of our operations – from design 

to construction of a development to the operations and 

maintenance of properties. We remain steadfast and look 

towards adopting leading practices so as to stay relevant and 

uphold our commitment towards delivering quality products 

and services to all our customers. 

QUALITY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 

From residential, commercial offices, hotels to more complex 

integrated developments, Yanlord strives for its projects to 

provide a safe and holistic environment for its customers. We 

are guided by a series of stringent quality standards covering 

areas of architecture, landscaping, indoor ambience to building 

management systems (such as mechanical and electrical, 

heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems), which 

will be monitored closely throughout the entire development 

and life cycle of a project.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

Property Development

The Research &amp; Development (“R&amp;D”) Department is 

responsible for ensuring quality control of the project as well 

as meeting the National requirements and Yanlord’s internal 

quality standards. The process starts from the checks performed 

on the property development premises, mid-term inspection, 

pre-completion inspection to the post-delivery inspection. 

Should there be any issues concerning product quality, they 

will be raised immediately to the respective departments for 

corrective actions to be taken.

While we remain guided by our existing product standards, we 

introduced the 2020 Yanlord Group Product Standardisation 

Core Value System that focuses on enhancing the competitive 

edge of our projects. This system works through summarising 

the key value points from the projects across seven core values 

covering marketing, design, cost and project quality aspects. 

Supported by our Group’s design management sharing 

platform, we also look towards shortening project design and 

decision-making time, thereby speeding up capital turnover 

as well. With references and examples readily available on 

this platform, it aids to improve product quality and controls 

time-sensitive costs of a project. Through this set of unified 

standards, we aim to deliver projects in a timely, cost-effective 

manner without compromising on the quality.

After the completion of the project, the R&amp;D team conducts post-project assessments to review the whole process of the 

projects, such as designs, materials used, project timeline and performance of suppliers, etc, to identify the core value points and 

the problems associated for the further improvement. The team also reaches out to the Procurement and Customer Relations 

Department to gather feedback and areas for improvements as well. This iterative process is effective in continuous enhancement 

of the quality of product and services rendered.

CASE STUDY: 

RESILIENT BUILDING DESIGN DURING COVID-19 

OUTBREAK

Even as the situation in PRC began to take an upturn with 

the COVID-19 outbreak being under control, customers have 

begun to put forward higher expectations on health and 

safety within residential and living spaces. Our R&amp;D team 

responded to these increased expectations.

There are three stages at which such R&amp;D elements have 

been introduced to increase resilience of buildings, safeguard 

residents and their loved ones from the risks brought about by 

the coronavirus. Here are some of the measures and design 

aspects introduced during the year, all of which remain within 

the newly introduced COVID-19 regulations:

Landscaping

• Provided a natural environment that allows for outdoor 

activities even within our residential premises. Residents of 

all ages are able to enjoy outdoor activities even during the 

lockdown. 

• Introduced flora and fauna to boost ecological diversity, 

vibrancy of the natural environment and purify the air. 

• Placed strategic contactless delivery points for deliverymen 

to leave groceries in cabinets within residential premises.

Product Design

• Provided amenities such as indoor heated swimming pool, 

badminton courts, gym and yoga rooms to allow residents to 

maintain a healthy lifestyle amidst the pandemic. 

• Disinfected and cleaned amenities regularly, set up 

neutral zones and provided hand sanitizers and necessary 

disinfectants.

Mechanical &amp; Electrical Systems (within the building)

• Used PM2.5 filters to prevent inflow of aerosols or any other 

minute particles within the atmosphere, in addition to the 

well-maintained ventilation systems at our residences.

• Used automatic doors and lifts to prevent contact at high 

touch points such as lift buttons and door handles.

• Used filtered water systems.

We strive to adapt to the changing needs of our residents amidst 

COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to provide customers with 

a modern and comfortable living environment that safeguards 

their health, safety and wellbeing.

CASE STUDY: 

3A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES AT YANLORD –SUZHOU YANLORD LAKEVIEW BAY





The ‘Commercial Residential Buildings Performance 

Certification Management Approach’ published by the 

Housing Industrialisation Promotion Center under the Ministry 

of Construction of PRC is considered the most scientific, 

authoritative and standardised criteria for housing performance 

in PRC, which evaluates five aspects of the buildings covering 

applicability, safety, durability, environment and economy. In 

addition to the requirements of the apartment space layout, 

it sets strict indicators for the lighting, community greening, 

exclusive space occupancy for the elderly and children in 

public areas, parking spaces for the residences, community’s 

informative platforms, digital management of the properties 

and use of energy-saving materials. As a result of strict 

assessment by the government, 3A level represents the highest 

residential construction standards in PRC with only a few 

projects are certified within PRC. 

As a 3A certified residential property, Suzhou Yanlord 

Lakeview Bay comprises integrated designs from the well-

known companies, such as Singapore JGP architecture, Bell 

Collins (Hong Kong (SAR)) and Taiwan Simou. It provides for 

the planned division of pedestrians and vehicles to maximise 

gardening space for the landscape,  greening space for 

the whole community, environmentally-friendly terracotta 

panels for the façade of the building, fully-furnished houses 

equipped with air-conditioning and fresh air system and full 

floor heating system for the whole house and is also one of 

the first properties to include dishwashers, ovens and other 

appliances as furnishings.  

In line with our Group’s development concept, Suzhou 

Yanlord Lakeview Bay provides a green, safe and comfortable 

living environment with the highest quality standard to our 

residences.

CARING FOR 

OUR CUSTOMERS

Managed Properties 

Across our managed properties, we frequently engage with 

our customers to keep abreast of their changing needs and 

evolving expectations. We have various channels and platforms 

that are made accessible to all customers, encouraging them to 

provide feedback while ensuring that we are able to promptly 

respond to the concerns they may have. 

Aside from that, we also actively reach out to our customers 

to gather feedback on their satisfaction levels. For our new 

property owners, our teams will reach out via phone calls to 

check in and obtain feedback on the services provided during 

the sales period, and after-sales period up to the point of 

delivery. The same check in would be done for these property 

owners a year later as well.  For longer term owners (two years 

and above), our team would reach out via phone calls or even 

conduct door-to-door visits (prior to COVID-19) to conduct 

satisfaction surveys as well as obtain suggestions or any 

comments on service rendered. 

In FY2020, we continued with our annual customer satisfaction 

survey for customers in PRC. Facilitated by an independent 

research agency, we surveyed buyers of residential and 

commercial properties, tenants within our office buildings, 

service apartments and retail outlets. From the results of these 

surveys, the relevant teams would reach out to the respective 

groups of customers to further understand their expectations so 

as to provide a tailored response where possible.

Hotels and Serviced Apartments

At Yanlord, our hotels and serviced apartments in PRC operate 

under major hotel brands such as InterContinental, and Crowne 

Plaza. Across the hotels and serviced apartments, quality 

service is ensured through a rigorous set of Standard Operating 

Procedures (“SOPs”) ranging from cleanliness, brand safety, 

brand standards and food safety.

To ensure that such SOPs are stringently adhered to, a monthly 

inspection would be conducted by our employees on these 

areas. For example, on food safety and hygiene aspects, 

checks are conducted daily to ensure proper cleaning and 

disinfection of the kitchen and food preparation areas. High 

touch areas would have to be cleaned thoroughly with suitable 

and safe chemicals. Microbiological swab tests will have to be 

conducted across the kitchen, serving and food preparation 

area every six months by qualified independent laboratories. 

Aside from these checks, emergency response drills such food 

safety incidents will be conducted to familiarise all employees 

of the actions to be taken. 

This comprehensive exercise includes reporting, investigation, 

tracing of affected raw food as well as the recalling of such 

products across the hotel. Additionally, complaints received 

from guests and diners on foreign objects in food would have 

to be recorded and reported to the food safety committee 

as well as the management. A formalised reporting process 

is in place to ensure that details from each case is properly 

documented and follow-up measures are taken.

Holistic Guest 

Experience

Aspects Identified  

Follow-up Actions

Food and Beverage 

Service

• Remind guests of their reservation prior to the trip date and provide details on hotel’s 

operating hours, places of interests and other information relevant to their stay 

• Enquire about their their likes and requirements and incorporate these into their stay 

• Ensure regular guest engagement during their stay to deepen their impression of the 

experience at our hotels and serviced apartments 

• Provide welcome snacks, gift packs on arrival and farewell gifts when guests’ check out 

• Improve breakfast service through quality of ingredients, portion and service. For example in 

Chengdu: introduction of bean soup and noodle series, representative of local flavours. 

• Update business menu regularly and invite guests to share their feedback on the dishes via 

QR code

Training 

Aside from this, our hotels have a comprehensive training 

structure for all employees, starting from onboarding, with 

specialised training and further adhoc training to meet 

requirements of specific events. On a regular basis, refresher 

trainings are also held to remind employees on the know-hows 

of hotel operations so as to maintain the highest standards 

of service quality. Some of the trainings held during the year 

include: Service Recovery, Understanding Member Benefits and 

True Hospitality. 

Guest Satisfaction

Guest satisfaction is a critical indicator of the service quality 

rendered. Throughout our operations, we consistently strive 

to understand their needs and work towards meeting, if not 

exceeding their expectations. In the long run, great guest 

experiences result in increased guest loyalty and ultimately 

allows us to gain a greater market share among the stiff 

competition within the hospitality industry. 

Annually, a guest satisfaction survey, Guest HeartBeat, is 

conducted to gather feedback on the overall experience 

our guests have during their stay in the hotels and serviced 

apartments. Key performance metrics cover the areas of: overall 

residence experience, breakfast service, and housekeeping. 

Aside from Guest HeartBeat, we also track customer satisfaction 

via Ctrip’s website where guests will complete a feedback form 

upon checking out from their stay. The scores will be displayed 

in real time on the homepage of the service apartments and 

hotels on the Ctrip website.

At the end of the year, an analysis will be performed on the 

survey results from Guest HeartBeat and comments gathered 

from the Ctrip website. Subsequently, relevant teams will 

brainstorm for necessary follow-up actions to be implemented 

for in the ensuing year.

Due to the feedback received from long-term residents and 

short-term tenants on issues such as food and beverage services, 

we reached out to some of the residents for a meeting to further 

understand their likes and dislikes, and obtain suggestions 

from them on what could be further improved. We have begun 

taking follow-up actions based on the feedback gathered. The 

table below summarises the two key aspects identified and the 

proposed follow-up actions to increase guest satisfaction in the 

next survey.

CASE STUDY: 

MEASURING GREAT GUEST EXPERIENCES – 

GUEST HEARTBEAT IN PRC

Since 2016,  we use an approach of ‘Guest Love’ to measure 

our guests’ overall satisfaction during their stay. Prior to this, 

satisfaction scores were calculated by averaging the scores 

that a guest rates each category in the survey. 

The new way of measurement (Guest Love) calculates the 

percentage of scores that lies in the 8, 9 or 10 (i.e top ‘3’ 

scoring boxes on a 1-10 scale). This means that the higher 

the percentage, the higher probability of intent a guest 

would return to our hotels. Greater guest experiences would 

result in increased guest loyalty, ultimately allowing us to 

gain a larger share of this competitive hospitality industry. 

This approach allows us to identify what defines a great 

guest experience rather than just ensuring that our hotels 

provide a consistent experience. As the change in Guest 

Love score may fluctuate more than the average scores, it 

allows us to promptly identify areas for targeted response or 

corrective actions to be taken. 

From here, we can better understand our guests’ 

expectations and effectively track areas where they are 

satisfied or unsatisfied about. All in all, we hope to maintain 

our competitive edge within the hospitality industry and 

strive to be a leading hotelier globally.

Customer Health and Safety

In FY2020, there were zero incidents of non-compliance concerning health and safety of products 

and services. There were also no breaches no breaches of voluntary codes in areas of customer 

health and safety or products and services as well. As we continue to adopt leading practices in 

customer health and safety, we strive to upkeep this performance in the years to come.

Hotels and Serviced Apartments

Although our hotels use the Guest Love approach to track satisfaction, they each have a 

separate target as the results gathered are specific to that hotel only. The approach remains 

similar across all hotels in terms of survey forms, calculation of satisfaction scores and analysis. 

Depending on the key areas raised by the guests, follow-up actions may vary. As such, this has 

resulted in different targets set to be achieved. 

We are proud that hotels and serviced apartments in PRC have met their targets set for FY2020 

and will continue to maintain this in the forthcoming year. All targets and performance across the 

hotels and serviced apartments are summarised in the table below.

how personal data of individuals our Group receives, or is in 

possession of, are handled, collected, used, disclosed, and 

protected. You may find our Privacy Policy on our website at  

http://yanlord.listedcompany.com/misc/privacy-policy-2021.pdf

Data Protection Laws We Comply With:

Personal Data Privacy Ordinance

Managing Customer Privacy  

Singapore

Yanlord’s Singapore operation has prepared for regulatory 

updates to the PDPA by keeping an eye on the latest 

developments in the area through newsletters, attending 

seminars, and communicating and advising staff on relevant 

updates, as appropriate. Our Privacy Policy is also reviewed 

and updated as and when necessary to stay in line with 

future developments, industry trends, and changes in legal or 

regulatory requirements. 

PRC

In PRC, we have an information security system which applies 

to all employees of Yanlord in place. Our management of 

customers’ personal information follows the principle that the 

data “the data user is responsible”, ensuring that we are able 

to trace the usage of customers’ personal information.  

At Yanlord, all employees involved in the handling of customers’ 

personal information are to perform the relevant information 

security duties according to their different roles and job scopes 

to protect the security of the data, use customers’ personal 

information with reasonable caution, and cannot disclose 

customers’ personal information to unrelated personnel, or 

personnel who are beyond the scope of their authority. 

To ensure that we are able to protect our customers’ personal 

information, we have the following practices in place: 

• 

Each department which collects customers’ personal data 

(such as the Customer Relations department and Marketing 

department) must have a person who is solely in charge of 

the management of customers’ personal information

• 

The person in charge of the management of customers’ 

personal information is responsible for day-to-day 

management of customer data, the consolidation 

of customer data, management of the information 

management system, and tracking the usage of customers’ 

personal information by other departments

• 

Employees in key positions with access to confidential 

information, such as the person in charge of management 

of customers’ personal information, are to sign a non-

disclosure agreement with Yanlord

• 

Customer data are stored securely in the information 

management system and paper copies archived securely. 

Where temporary documents are created in the course 

of business, these are not to be stored, and are to be 

destroyed in a timely manner 

– 

Customer data are to be protected via passwords, and 

when transfer of data is required by departments, they 

are to be sent only via the corporate mailbox, with the 

upper management of the relevant department, and the 

department in charge of data management copied 

– 

Archived files are to be locked in cabinets with the key 

held by a dedicated person. When accessed for review 

and borrowing, records of access authorisation, review 

and borrowing are kept 

• 

Customer data can only be accessed after the employee 

obtains the necessary authorisation, which may be 

long-term or temporary, depending on the applicant 

or department’s needs. Where adjustments to the 

authorisation are to be made, they are adjusted within one 

working day

• 

If it is necessary to use the centralised customer database, 

such as when dealing with information related to utilities 

or mass updates, we strictly control the scope of customer 

data to ensure that no information will be unnecessarily 

disclosed 

– 

When customer information to be used on external 

devices, the documents cannot be stored on the 

external computers, and must be stored on and used 

from specialised mobile storage devices such as USB 

flash drives and external hard drives 

– 

Once the customer data has been used, it is returned to 

the person in charge of the management of customers’ 

personal information, with the return time logged. Once 

the data is reviewed by the person in charge to ensure 

there are no discrepancies or errors, it will be destroyed 

and related information will be recorded

• 

When entering into agreements with external parties who 

may require the use of customer data, we require the 

inclusion of confidentiality of information and breach of 

confidentiality of information clauses

EMPLOYEE DEMOGRAPHICS

 

As at 31 December 2020, the workforce within the reporting 

scope comprised 9,884 employees¹.The majority of our workforce 

is based in PRC. The vast majority of our employees are hired on 

a full-time basis, and female and male employees composed 42% 

and 58% of the entire staff population respectively.

In Hong Kong (SAR) and Singapore we hire our employees 

on a predominantly permanent basis, whereas in PRC we hire 

our employees on a predominately fixed-term² basis due to 

differing employment cultures and labour laws³. Our employees 

are offered standard 3- or 5-year contracts in line with industry 

practice upon hire. During this time, they are treated as 

permanent employees and are provided full employee benefits. 

Additionally, we offer an open-ended contract after renewal of 

employment for two consecutive fixed-terms, in line with the 

Labour Contract Law of PRC.

Please refer to the charts and tables for more details on the 

breakdown.

1 

Employees refer to only staff who have entered into employment contracts 

with Yanlord and/or its subsidiaries. 

2 

This year’s report clearly defines permanent employees as only those whose 

employee contracts are for indefinite periods, whereas Yanlord’s Sustainability 

Report 2019 defined employee contracts with fixed terms exceeding a certain 

time period to be permanent employees.

3 

In PRC, fixed-term contracts are the norm due to employee terminations 

being regulated to a higher extent than in Singapore or Hong Kong (SAR).

EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING

Employees are the key contributors to the success of every 

business, and to our sustainable development. We recruit our 

employees based on merit regardless of age, race, gender, 

marital status, or family background. To ensure that our 

employees are treated with respect, trust, and understanding, 

we focus on fostering a positive corporate culture.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

To support our staff in performing to the fullest of their 

potentials, we have training programmes at different levels to 

ensure they have the capability to perform the tasks required 

of them. Our training development plan takes into account the 

skills required at various levels of responsibility and years of 

experience.

Some of the training programmes we hold for our employees 

include:

Management Talent Training Programme

When we design training programmes and curriculum for our management-level staff, we have a 4-step process to ensure that 

we are designing the training for the right audience, delivering the right information for our business needs, ensuring that our 

employees’ learning is supported, and achieving the desired outcomes. 

Here are the four steps in greater detail: 

Selecting the Right People 

We aim to develop talents who have a high level 

of employee loyalty, high performance ability, and 

clear ideas for management, but who have not yet 

received systemic training. We focus on promoting 

strong strategic interpretation and implementation 

ability, strong resource integration ability, and 

emphasis on cross-departmental collaboration.

Holding Dialogues and Course Design

We believe that in order to effectively design training courses, we need to understand what the requirements of employees at all 

levels of our Group are. We therefore use the following:

Interview/Survey 

Purpose of Interview/Survey

Relevance to Course Design 

Non-anonymous interview 

of the training candidate’s 

superiors 

• To determine organisation’s needs

• To understand the expectations of senior 

management

• Serves as the basis for curriculum design and 

active learning design

Non-anonymous interview of 

the training candidate

• To determine the candidate’s professional needs 

in terms of training required and degree of 

mastery

• Serves as the basis for internal trainers to 

develop professional training courses 

Anonymous survey of the 

training candidate’ direct 

reports

• To determine the candidate’ levels of 

professionalism, management skill, decision-

making ability, etc.

• Serves as the basis for curriculum design 

Supporting Mechanisms 

To ensure that our talents have a conducive learning environment, we require support from different business functions in order to carry out 

our training programmes smoothly. The involved business functions are:

Planning the Project Advancement Trajectory

We organise training sessions such that there are clear timelines. 

This enables our trainees to understand what the key milestones 

and outputs are, as well as what the expected learning outcomes 

and returns are. 

Enhanced Appraisal System for Talent Discovery and Grooming

We enhanced our appraisal system in FY2020, in line with our 

ongoing regional expansion. As part of the enhancements, 

we improved our performance assessment methodology and 

mechanisms, to improve our ability to discover and groom talents. 

To date, 100%  of our employees have undergone at least one 

formal appraisal process.

Employee Engagement Survey

Yanlord has conducted employee engagement surveys since 2018 to identify factors affecting our employees’ morale, identify ways 

to work on their pain points, and provide insights into how we can improve our management. In FY2020, we view the employee 

engagement survey as a tool to better understand the effectiveness of our Group from within, predict potential problem areas, and 

provide effective data for decision-making and implementation of Group strategies. 

From a total of 1,918 effective responses, we found that the 

overall average of the employee engagement in our Group falls 

into the top 25% of companies using the Gallup’s Q12 Employee 

Engagement Survey, which is considered world class. Within our 

Group, 7 companies had an average value higher than the 75th 

percentile, including our Group platform. Key points to note 

from the survey were that the ranking of driving factors related 

to direct superiors and the management team rose significantly, 

while there were also overt and hidden issues such as emphasis 

on overall returns, evaluations and incentives, employee growth 

and development, and difficulties in cross-regional mobilisation.

Core Findings from the Engagement Survey

Findings   

Description 

Noticeable differences 

between employee 

engagement levels in 

different business units

 

• Cities where employees were more engaged had higher operating 

efficiency 

• Certain cities fell behind in terms of employee engagement 

• Information Systems, Customer Relations, Operations, and Human 

Resources lines have increased employee engagement levels 

while business functions had a continuous decrease in employee 

engagement levels, and the investment functions had a significant 

decrease in employee engagement levels

• Employee engagement performance clearly indicates the 

difference in terms of pressure on each business function

Noticeable differences 

between employee 

engagement levels 

for different groups of 

employees

• M9 – M12 group’s employee engagement levels have a high level 

of variation 

• The key drivers for the M9 – M12 group’s employee engagement 

level are overall returns, structure, culture, information, and 

decision-making

• The degree of employee engagement is a smiling curve 

distribution according to years spent in the company, with 3 – 5 

years as the valley

• Employees who have been with us for the long-term are 

concerned about recognition and motivation from the company, 

whereas employees who have been with us for a shorter time are 

more concerned about learning and development

Maintenance of employee 

engagement standards 

over the past 3 years

• Core driving factors for employee engagement have shifted 

• Besides traditional core driving factors such as brand reputation, 

clear mission and vision as well as management, the working 

environment and colleagues featured as core driving factors for the 

first time 

• Among the factors that matter to employees across all business 

lines and all ranks are remuneration, ability, performance, 

incentives, and job retention

Action Plan for Improvement Based on Survey Results  

To improve on our employee engagement and satisfaction levels, we are working on a number 

of measures. These include measures such as: 

• 

establishing a comprehensive performance management system that emphasises the link 

between our Group strategy, organisational performance, and individual performance

• 

identifying talents, as well as training and development paths, promoting leadership building 

projects

• 

creating more opportunities for talents to take leadership positions and rotate between 

departments to further develop their abilities  

• 

describing talents and capabilities needed to align with our Group strategy clearly, and 

strengthen team building capacity by assessing the effectiveness of training

• 

strengthening interactions between our Group and city offices to encourage sharing of 

information and management styles, in order to better understand the advantages of the 

different offices and work together to establish clear management standards and evaluations

• 

developing a comprehensive rewards programme which balances special incentives with 

operational incentives

TARGET AND PERFORMANCE

FY2020 

PERFORMANCE

FY2021 

TARGET

21 training hours per

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

At Yanlord, we recognise the importance of our people as 

the key to the success of our business and as fundamental 

in sustaining organisational effectiveness and performance. 

Therefore, we are dedicated to safeguarding our people’s 

welfare and improving their workplace competencies to 

achieve the mutual benefits of our employees’ professional 

development and better organisational performance. We 

believe a comprehensive and healthy workplace can encourage 

employees to be more active in their work and thus, motivate 

the whole organisation to improve productivity and increase 

the retention rate.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

In PRC, our occupational health and safety is managed under 

the guidance of onsite safety standardisation management 

rules at the construction sites which includes requirements on 

entrance management, routine meetings, unified clothing, 

emergency plans, isolation and protection equipment and 

board of notice, etc.

In Singapore, we have implemented our Occupational Health 

and Safety Policy by:

• 

Upholding universal occupational safety &amp; health standards by 

providing a framework for setting key occupational health and 

safety (“OHS”) objectives

• 

Never compromising on compliance with relevant 

regulations, legislations and other requirements 

• 

Improving the OHS management system through the 

involvement of relevant workers from all levels in the reviewing 

of existing processes as well as the setting of new processes 

• 

Training and educating all workers on workplace safety &amp; 

health, and emergence preparedness

• 

Eliminating hazards and reduce OHS risks in the workplace

• 

Developing and promoting a culture that supports a safe, 

secure and healthy workplace

Figure 7: Incident Reporting Process

Figure 8: Hierarchy of Controls

Property Development

Our OHS management system at construction sites is 

developed based on the national laws, regulations and 

standards, such as National Standards of PRC: Unified Code for 

Technique for Constructional Safety (GB50870-2013), Technical 

Code for Safety of Construction Machinery (JGJ130-2001) and 

Safety in Welding and Cutting (GB9448-1999), etc.

All OHS issues are taken care by a team consisting of our 

project team, representatives of supervising companies 

and the general managers and safety leaders of our main 

contractors. Safety officers of our main contractors will conduct 

daily assessments on site while the project supervisors and 

Yanlord’s project team will organise the site inspections every 

week to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, 

and to assess if there are any potential safety risks or hidden 

dangers. All inspectors have been well trained to find the 

issues effectively and for any OHS findings found during the 

inspections, the main contractors will be notified and asked for 

correction until the hidden danger is eliminated. 

Our control method is based on the hierarchy of controls as 

below:

We have set up feedback boxes for workers to report their 

concerns or findings, and they can also report their concerns 

directly to the site safety officer verbally. Any safety incident 

that happens within the sites is to be reported to the relevant 

Group departments within 24 hours of occurrence. Updates 

on regulations and incidents, if any, will be communicated 

and discussed through the weekly supervision meeting where 

Yanlord’s project team, supervision companies and our main or 

sub contractors will be represented.

 

At constructions sites, we set up our own clinics with free 

treatments for minor injuries such as bruises, while transport to 

general hospitals is provided in the event of major injuries.

We have also purchased safety insurance for all workers including 

our Group employees and contractors on site. 

Dormitories and canteens are provided where facility conditions 

and safety awareness has been communicated to ensure that 

the safety at these places. Working hours will be adjusted when 

necessary to ensure that our workers stay in a healthy condition 

at work.

We evaluate the different training needs through questionnaires 

and applicable trainings will be arranged for supervision 

engineers, management of our main contractors as well as 

front-line operators on a monthly basis. All internal trainings are 

free of charge and conducted during paid working hours using 

languages which are easily understood by workers. Workers are 

also able to register on the website of the Ministry of Housing 

and Urban-Rural Development of PRC for technical trainings 

and tests. 

At construction sites, we take effort to avoid any safety 

incidents by adhering to the requirements set out in our 

safety management procedure, conduct routine trainings and 

inspections and take proactive actions to rectify situations to 

avoid further negative impacts arising from similar situations.

Managed Properties

At managed properties, our Occupational Health and Safety 

management system is certified by  GB/T 45001-2020 / ISO 

45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety management 

standards at China Group Management Office with various 

supporting procedures in place, such as Risks and Opportunities 

Management Control Procedures, Hazards Identification and 

Risks Control procedures, etc. To be in line with the applicable 

laws and regulations, a masterlist of laws and regulations has 

been developed and maintained up to the date. 

To ensure the effectiveness of our OHS management system, 

a three-level inspection including daily inspections, internal 

audits, and management reviews has been developed to achieve 

continuous improvement of our system. Customer feedback 

will also be treated as one of the key inputs in this improvement 

process. 

The hazards identification process cover all workers including 

employees, visitors and suppliers in the workplace. Routine, 

abnormal and emergent situations in the past, present and 

future have been fully considered such as all the past incidents, 

emergent cases and changes related to the organisation’s 

operations, together with other social factors such as workload, 

working hours, deception, harassment and bullying issues and 

physical environment including facilities and materials, for all 

working process such as design, planning, testing, production 

and maintenance, etc.

Based on the different sources and level of risks of the hazards 

identified, Yanlord has taken the following actions to reduce the 

associated risks to the minimum: 

a.  setting targets and implemented management plan;

b.  standardise the behaviors in the workplace by implementing 

standard operating procedures;

c.  implementing emergency plan;

d.  conducting safety trainings; and

e. taking corrective actions whenever needed. Risks associated 

with the harzards will be reviewed every year.

Various departments are required to take the responsibilities and 

implement corrective actions for all non-conformances identified 

by the external auditors or findings identified through the three-

level inspections. Any potential hazards found by the workers 

are reported to their departments and all OHS related issues or 

information will be updated to the workers through meetings 

or trainings. Our labour union will also take its responsibilities to 

protect workers’ rights in the workplace.

In Singapore, we conform to ISO 45001:2018 for the following 

activities:

•   Provision of corporate management services to business 

activities of UEL group encompassing property management 

and integrated facility management, which span the design, 

build and operate value chain

•   Provision of property development, project management and 

leasing

•   Provision of integrated facility management and other 

technical support

•   Lease and management of serviced apartments

•   Management of hotels

Due to the varying nature of work activities and potential risks, 

Corporate Office, Property and Hospitality divisions maintain 

separate risk registers. The respective OHS management 

representatives review their respective risk registers regularly to 

ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 



Recurring trainings are conducted to ensure employees are 

familiar with OHS-related matters such as first aid, use of AED 

(Automated External Defibrillator).  However, many of the OHS 

trainings were cancelled or conducted virtually due to COVID-19 

restrictions and limited trainings provided.

 

In FY2020, we conducted a Virtual Workplace Event including 

E-Bazaar and a talk on “Work Related Injury &amp; Prevention”and 

a mental wellbeing talk of “Motivation for Greater Activation: 

Healthy Living” in Singapore.

Hotels and Serviced Apartments 

OHS risks at hotels are controlled by following the unified 

Global Risk Management Standard set by the hotel 

management team. The hotel management team also conducts 

audits at all our hotels every year to ensure compliance with 

laws and regulations, as well as the timely follow-up on plans 

for improvements identified during the audits.

Our annual risk management plan is strictly applied and 

monitored throughout the year. For any potential cases, 

workers can report to their seniors or supervisors, or the 

security department. All employees are engaged through 

meetings such as the General Manager Roundtable for 

employees, regular meetings of the employee committee and 

meeting with interns to discuss and suggest improvements 

to OHS management. Additionally, we use channels such 

as emails, notice boards, and acknowledgements of key 

information for effective communication with employees. 

Qualified third-party trainers are invited to upskill the OHS 

knowledge of our employees so that they can be equipped 

with enough prevention or mitigation skills when facing 

hazards. These trainings will be conducted every month in 

line with the compulsory trainings required by the regulations, 

findings during daily operations and feedback from employees. 

Promotion of Worker Health

Across all business units, we also focus on health education 

and training, injury prevention, and implement targeted welfare 

support projects to improve the health of employees.

CASE STUDY: 

WORKPLACE SAFETY AND HEALTH PROGRAMME

UEL has embarked on a three-phase Total Workplace Safety 

and Health (WSH) programme in Singapore which is fully 

subsidised:

 

Phase 1: Assessment (Completed in March 2020) 

The assessment phase involved the walk-through 

assessment of overall workplace safety and health, basic 

health survey of employees and WSH questionnaire to 

identify gaps in the management of WSH. The assessment 

reports have been completed for 5 entities in Singapore.

Phase 2: Intervention (Started in December 2020) 

During phase 2, various customised intervention 

programmes such as health screenings, health coachings, 

talks and workshops were implemented to address the 

identified health issues that have impact on work and safety. 

Phase 3: Monitoring and Evaluation 

In this phase, the progress of intervention programmes 

will be monitored and evaluation will be performed on the 

outcomes and effectiveness.





For example, at Yanlord, we

1.  provide annual medical examinations to help employees be 

aware of their health risks and prevent health issues before 

they occur. At the same time, we will arrange one-to-one 

medical report consultation sessions after the physical 

examination with medical guidance by the professionals.

2.  purchase commercial medical insurance for employees. 

We will also actively understand employees needs’ through 

data analysis, such as absence or leave data, medical 

claims, health screening data, etc. and evaluate the 

effectiveness of current management through employees’ 

health data for further innovation and improvement.

3.  provide employees with necessary annual paid vacations 

and organise healthy exercises such as healthy running, 

badminton, basketball and other daily sports across our 

Group. For example, our Group has organised biennial 

football matches in different cities across PRC. We have 

also independently created the “Y-TIME” sports club brand 

aiming to advocate healthy cultural values  for residences 

and employees, increase the cohesion and centripetal force 

of our Group, and improve the happiness of employees.

4.  care for employees during special periods, such as the 

normal breastfeeding leave and maternity leave for female 

employees, and visit the employees during sick leaves and 

hospitalisation.

FY2020 

PERFORMANCE

Property Development

In FY2020, there were zero cases of work-related fatalities, 

recordable work-related injuries or work-related ill health at 

our construction sites. A total of 727,680 working hours were 

recorded from our employees¹ during FY2020.

Managed Properties

In FY2020, we recorded 38 work-related injuries (including 1 

fatality) at our managed buildings compared to 39 in FY2019. 

We are deeply saddened by the fatal incident where an 

employee fell off the ladder during maintenance works. He was 

sent to the hospital immediately and  follow-up actions were 

promptly taken to reassess the risks associated with the work 

performed to prevent recurrences in the future. These follow-up 

actions include conducting labour safety training, conducting 

safety inspections, and issuing Work Safety Guidelines. 

1 

The total working hours of Yanlord’s employees at construction sites are 

estimated based on 40 working hours per working week. Data is unavailable 

for workers who are non-employees at our construction sites and we will 

consider to include the figure in future reporting periods.

2 

A high-consequence injury is one where the employee cannot, does not or is 

not expected to recover fully to pre-injury health status within six months. The 

rate is calculated by taking the number of high-consequence injuries over the 

total working hours of the employees multiplied by 1,000,000.

3 

A recordable work-related injury is one which arises out of or in the course of 

work that could or does result in injury or ill health. The rate is calculated by 

taking the number of recordable work-related injury over the total working 

hours of employees multiplied by 1,000,000.

PRESERVING 

OUR PLANET

In 2019, the buildings and construction sector accounted for 

35% of global energy use and 38% of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) 

emissions amounting to almost 10 gigatonnes carbon dioxide 

(“CO2”) emissions, which is the highest ever recorded¹. As 

a leading property developer, we recognise the impact our 

business operations may have on the environment. From 

design to construction and operations to maintenance, each 

stage of a building’s life cycle can leave a considerable carbon 

footprint. At Yanlord, we recognise the key role we play in two 

aspects; first in managing the risks and opportunities brought 

about by climate change and the second in optimising our 

operations towards responsible use of natural resources.

CLIMATE CHANGE 

In the last decade, the focus on climate change has seen an 

exponential increase - from investors demanding more ESG-

related information to regulators introducing guidelines and 

frameworks to encourage ESG reporting and other relevant 

disclosures.

Reported in 2020 Global Status Report for Buildings and Construction, 

published by the International Energy Agency (“IEA”)

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

We have always adhered to the philosophy of “acting 

cautiously, expanding steadily, taking a long-term view, 

and pursuing sustainable development”. To support the 

SDGs, we hope to build up our responsibilities as a global 

sustainable company by establishing business awareness of 

active responses to climate change and gradually putting this 

awareness into practice.

In FY2020, we introduced our Climate Change Policy which 

details our commitment towards managing the impacts of 

climate change throughout our entire value chain. Under 

the policy, a series of action plans have been drawn up to 

ensure accountability at management level and set out the 

course of action from here. We will be setting up a climate 

change risk assessment team tasked to identify and evaluate 

climate change risks and provide regular updates to the Risk 

Management and Sustainability Committee. These risks would 

then be incorporated into the company’s decision-making 

model. 

Starting from the identification of climate risks and 

opportunities, we actively respond to the possible impacts 

on the entire value chain. At the same time, we monitor the 

energy consumption and emissions of the entire life cycle 

of the project which can help to directly or indirectly reduce 

greenhouse gas emissions, thereby slowing the trend of global 

warming. We also work closely with all our internal and external 

stakeholders, such as various departments within our Group 

and the business partners along our supply chain to achieve a 

win-win goal for everyone. Our Group will review this policy to 

ensure its continued relevance in the fast-changing business 

environment amid the increasing sustainability concerns.

Besides our Group policy, under our managed properties, 

we also have two hotels and one serviced apartment under 

the InterContinental Hotels Group (“IHG”)’s management. 

The Crisis Management Committee at IHG has established 

a groupwide Crisis Management Plan which provides an 

organised and efficient response in the event of crisis which 

include, but are not limited to, fire hazards, natural disasters 

and energy interruptions. The plan also takes reference from 

the applicable laws and regulations of the countries we operate 

in. The committee oversees this plan and reviews it on a 

regular basis to ensure its continued relevance to the hotels’ 

operations.

PRESERVING 

OUR PLANET

Throughout the life cycle of our properties, we have considered the climate-related risks and adopted climate adaptation measures. They are detailed in the figures below.

STEP 1: 

ASSESSING CLIMATE-RELATED 

RISK DURING INVESTMENT/

LAND ACQUISITION

Land ready for development is 

considered as one of the scarcest 

resources in PRC. At Yanlord, non-

financial risks are assessed during 

the investment process. They take 

into consideration the purchasing 

power across various regions and 

cities, demands of various projects 

as well as the environment 

and climatic conditions. Such 

factors can include biodiversity 

and various climate scenarios in 

regions and seasons such as a 

typical summer with concentrated 

rainfall in PRC, the flood season in 

Yangtze River Delta, the cold wave 

in the North during winter and 

typhoons in the southern parts of 

PRC.

In the event where there are 

uncontrollable risks such as serious 

stakeholder concern, it will result 

in immediate termination of 

the process. For risks which are 

deemed to be controllable, Yanlord 

will take the necessary steps to 

eliminate or mitigate these risks 

during the design and construction 

process detailed in Step 2.

STEP 2: 

ELIMINATING AND MITIGATING 

RISKS DURING DESIGN AND 

CONSTRUCTION PHASE

With the risks identified by the 

Investment Department, the 

Planning and Design Department 

will propose for appropriate 

actions based on project budget 

and existing resources to eliminate 

or mitigate the risks. Examples can 

include climate-adaptive building 

features such as thermal insulation 

material for the buildings in 

North and wind-proof design 

for the buildings in the South. 

These can extend to include 

emergency plans for typhoons 

and reinforcement of dams. 

We strive to address the identified 

risks in the earlier stage to ensure 

there will not be any residual 

climate-related impacts which 

could potentially hinder the 

construction phase. Thereafter, 

our construction team will 

commence the work based on the 

design plans.

STEP 3: 

MONITORING AND MANAGING CLIMATE OR ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS DURING OPERATIONAL

Climate and environmental factors are closely monitored at our residential and commercial properties through 

various feature and systems. They are detailed below: 

A feedback system is in place where the property 

management team gather comments from the ground 

and evaluate them for continuous improvement of its 

existing operations. Where appropriate, they may also be 

considered for future developments. 

In response to typhoons and seawater intrusion in 

Zhuhai PRC, our property service center has established 

emergency teams which introduced typhoon and flood 

prevention plans, ensuring business continuity and 

minimising losses in the event of a natural disaster. They 

also prepare and disseminate materials on wind and flood 

prevention to educate tenants on measures they can take.

The team also provides rescue materials to affected 

tenants and ensure prompt recovery of the site in an 

organised and efficient manner. To date, the property’s 

emergency rescue capability is 30% higher than the 

other buildings within the same area, with post-disaster 

recovery capabilities have exceeded by 50% as well.

Across hotel operations, typhoon or earthquakes have 

also been identified as the biggest climate/weather-

related risks. A similar system is established which 

comprises extreme weather emergency plans and crisis 

management plan to ensure preparedness and business 

resumption.

GREEN BUILDINGS 

At Yanlord, we adhere strictly with the green building 

requirements stipulated by the government and continually 

seek to raise our building standards through adoption of 

leading international green standards such as Leadership in 

Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”).

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

As a responsible developer, we actively support PRC’s 2030 

emission peak &amp; 2060 carbon neutrality goals and take practical 

actions to promote the innovation and implementation of related 

technologies for green buildings and low-carbon residential 

communities. We will adopt green initiatives and practices 

that consider the whole life cycle of the buildings such as 

green planning, green designs, adaptive solutions for different 

products, emission reduction and green technologies and green 

innovation and system, etc.

We adhere to our development method of “ecology first, green 

and low-carbon” and strive to create a good living environment 

and build human-nature co-density as a model of alleviating 

global warming for real estate developers.

In FY2020, we developed our Green Building Policy based 

on the belief that we should be kind to the lands we have. 

We prioritise ecology and always seek green and low carbon 

initiatives. Under the policy, we have also set out several action 

plans which cover the entire life cycle of a building development. 

For instance, during pre-acquisition phase, we will assess the 

ecology of the area and plan for green design features which 

allows the integration of our buildings into the environment. The 

harmonisation is an effective way of minimising environmental 

impacts as well as mitigating those which may arise in the 

future. During the design and construction phase, we strive to 

incorporate green design features or utilise environmentally 

friendly materials which allows the development to meet green 

building requirements, standards and attain certifications. Details 

of the action plans are further elaborated in the Life Cycle 

Management infographics on the right. 

Life Cycle Management

Environmental factors are considered 

in our land acquisition process 

as mentioned in Climate Change 

section. Besides, Yanlord has 

developed several projects aiming to 

improve local ecological performance 

for the urban land and to achieve 

water reuse during greenfield 

development by combining modern 

agricultural technology. See the 

case studies for the examples of our 

Sino-Singapore Nanjing Eco Hi-Tech 

Island and Zhuhai East Liu Shi Shan 

Redevelopment Project.

At Yanlord, we have achieved 100% 

green building designs, while our 

procurement and construction 

activities follow our design plans to 

ensure the implementation of our 

green building features. 

At the same time, under the guidance 

of the general policies of our supplier 

management, environmental-friendly 

materials and suppliers will be chosen, 

wherever possible. Yanlord aims to 

partner with the industry leading 

suppliers to provide the eco-friendly 

and qualified products to our clients. 

We also promote green building 

concepts besides the green building 

design requirements when applicable, 

for example, in the outdoor landscape 

design, rivers, lakes and rainwater 

treatment technology is used to 

reduce the use of tap water, rain 

and sewage diversion and waste 

management are implemented at the 

construction sites. 

Yanlord has engaged with our tenants 

through tenant lease agreements, 

such as equipment and decoration 

contracts, to ensure the compliance 

with all national requirements 

covering fire safety, environmental 

testing requirements and other 

green standards, such as LEED 

requirements. For example, at Yanlord 

Riverside Plaza (Phase 2) in Tianjin, we 

share the green decoration air quality 

standard with our tenants and request 

the submission of green decoration 

reports when the works are done to 

ensure the healthy indoor air quality 

of our buildings.

During daily operations, water and 

waste management will be conducted 

as in the table on the next page.

Managing of Green Building features 

Water 

Management 

Rain and sewage diversion at construction sites 

Rainwater and sewage are separated and discharged into different pipelines at 

construction sites. Sewage is collected in septic tanks and sent to wastewater 

treatment plants directly, while rainwater is collected into three-state sedimentation 

tanks through gravity flow or pump, after which, the clean water is discharged 

into municipal rainwater or nearby water bodies. The purpose of separation 

of rainwater and sewage is to reduce the impact of wastewater volume on the 

sewage treatment plant and to avoid river pollution by sending the sewage to the 

treatment plant directly. 

Water conservation at properties  

Water management at properties follows our energy conservation and emission 

management guidelines. 

Other water management at properties

In addition to general water management, three of our projects also utilise 

rainwater collection and reuse systems for green irrigation for water savings. 

Waste 

Management

Waste management at construction sites 

We have adopted the principle of ‘large diversion, small classification’ for all kinds 

of wastes generated at construction sites which help to ensure the construction 

wastes and bulky wastes will not be mixed and transported with domestic 

wastes. Waste storage points are set based on waste categories and feasibility 

of transportation. The general construction contractor will be responsible for the 

waste management while the third-party is engaged for waste classification and 

collection regularly.

Waste management at properties  

Yanlord adopts an active approach in response to all the requirements of waste 

classification and treatment in different region and cities of PRC. For example, we 

have fully implemented waste classification measures at Shanghai, Nanjing, and 

Suzhou according to the local requirements. For undelivered projects such as in 

Wuhan, Shenyang and and Hangzhou, suggestions for waste management are 

proposed before the handover for our further management. 

Management procedures are implemented for recycled wastes (such as paper 

box, plastic bottles and glasses) and hazard wastes (such as battery and hazardous 

solvents). All the wastes will be disposed and treated by the qualified third party. 

Managing of Green Building features 

Energy and 

Emission 

Management 

Energy management at construction sites 

Yanlord’s construction activities are carried out based on the design plans and the 

associated cost. For example, we have adopted thermal insulation measures on 

the exterior walls of the buildings by using integrated thermal insulation panels, 

hollow glass and sunshading measures to reduce energy loss of the buildings; for 

multi-storey and high-rise buildings, solar water heaters or photovoltaic panels are 

installed on the roof as energy supplies. 

At the same time, a large number of LED lamps are used on sites which can help 

to save around 60% to 70% of electricity compared to normal lamps. Sound and 

light induction lamps are also used in stairs and basements to reduce unnecessary 

electricity use. Energy saving posters are posted on site and office areas as well.

Energy management at properties 

Our Group Property Management Department manages our energy and emissions 

under the ‘Guidelines of Energy Conservation and Emission Reductions’. On a 

regular basis, we analyse our energy consumptions through a dedicated energy 

management platform and make adjustments to the equipment usage plans based 

on the different seasons as well as the intensity of equipment used in peak and 

non-peak periods.   

Across our Group, key performance indicators on energy and emissions are 

also included as part of the performance evaluation process. There are two 

components; namely, the comprehensive annual building inspection and 

benchmarking exercises at each regional company:

• For the annual building inspection: energy-related indicators make up 20% 

of the total criteria which considers the actual performance of energy-saving 

equipments and to  maintain the energy efficiency at a stipulated level

• For the nine property management benchmarking projects: 15% of indicators 

tracked relates to energy efficiency and management

• Result from the annual inspections and benchmarking projects would contribute 

15% of the regional company’s year-end performance appraisal

Apart from environmental and social features that need to be considered under green building design requirements, we actively monitor and manage our performance in other environmental and 

social categories during the construction and operation stages.

CASE STUDY: 

ENERGY MANAGEMENT AT YANLORD LANDMARK IN CHENGDU

Operational 

Phase

Lighting 

Use of a Building Automation (BA) control system to control 

common lighting within the building. It optimises building 

lighting based on the weather and availability of sunlight 

throughout the day. Throughout the building, the following 

initiatives were also introduced: 

• Sound-activated and motion-sensor lighting fitted with 

energy-saving bulbs are used in the corridors to save energy

• Conventional lighting replaced by lighting wells and 

installed night lights to increase visibility in carparks 

• Subsequently in 2017, Chengdu Yanlord Landmark invested 

RMB 97,000 to replace all conventional lights into energy-

efficient LED lights together with  a sub-loop control system 

which is also able to control emergency lighting within a 

unified power supply system. This initiative has reduced 

about 109,200 kWh of electricity per year which translates 

to about RMB 130,000 of savings annually  

Operational 

Phase

Air Conditioning

• Regular cleaning of components such as the filter, evaporator 

and condenser to maintain optimal efficiency of system 

• Scheduled walks to check for and ensure optimal air 

conditioning efficiency (such as temperature, air flow) in 

common areas of the building 

• Encourage tenants to install window insulation films or use 

blackout curtains to prevent absorption of sunlight and heat 

at units which are directly exposed to the sun  

• Lighting and air conditioning schedule adjusted based on 

the seasons, weather and demand (such as during working 

or non-working hours) 

Design 

Phase

For existing and new Asset Enhancement Initiatives (AEIs): 

Selection of energy-saving and cost-efficient equipment on 

the first installation to avoid higher costs in the later stages or 

during maintenance.

their regional headquarters to Chengdu. Please find more description of 

our Chengdu Yanlord Landmark on our website at  

http://www.yanlordland.com/project/yanlord-landmark/  

Due to the vast facilities and equipments required to support our diverse 

mix of tenants and their operations, this has resulted in high energy 

consumption and utilities cost. Since 2011, Yanlord has commissioned 

an energy consumption analysis and has closely monitored energy 

consumption over the years. This analysis is detailed below:  

Step 1: Analysis of Energy Consumption 

In an inaugural analysis conducted in 2011, monthly electricity 

consumption was gathered from the office buildings, apartments and 

common areas of Chengdu Yanlord Landmark. Thereafter, the data was 

consolidated for further analysis. It revealed that 50% of the overall 

electricity consumption was attributed to the air-conditioning system and 

32% from lighting. From here, Yanlord set out the aim to reduce energy 

consumption where possible and increase existing efficiencies of its 

systems.

CASE STUDY: 

SINO-SINGAPORE NANJING ECO HI-TECH ISLAND

Sino-Singapore Nanjing Eco Hi-tech Island is a flagship 

township development program co-sponsored by the 

Ministry of Trade and Industry of Singapore and the provincial 

government of Jiangsu, PRC. Commissioned to explore a 

more sustainable approach to urban development,  

a Sino-Singapore joint venture was formed in 2009, in which 

Yanlord plays the leading role in the overall planning and the 

multi-phase execution. Jiangxinzhou, an island located in 

Yangtze River with an area of 15 square kilometers and which 

had previously been occupied by displaced peasants from 

Anhui Province in the upper stream of Yangtze River, was 

chosen for the joint efforts.

Traditionally, the island was disconnected from the city proper 

of Nanjing in terms of land transportation, power grid and 

potable water supplies while the 10,000 strong local residents 

lived on simple farming, supplemented by taking up jobs in a 

small ship-yard, which was the only industrial presence on the 

island, or commuted between the city and island on regular 

basis. The residences had to endure daily inconveniences 

of unstable power supply from localised generators and the 

randomly discharged household sewage water due to the non-

existence of sewage water system.  

Therefore, beginning from 2009, Yanlord, together with 

Sembcorp Development  Ltd. and local state-owned enterprise 

partners, initiated a transformative development scheme to 

explore better solutions for the island. The forward-looking 

planning was developed based on meticulous research of the 

local environment and the advanced development solutions. 

Ratified in 2011, the planning plays a guiding role in the 

subsequent development work. The salient features include: 

• 

A minimalist approach to the environmentally sensitive 

areas including the riverside wetland and other valuable 

vegetation areas. Hence, the 2.5-hectare local fir forest, 

among others, is preserved while the small household 

• 

Modernisation of local infrastructure facilities. Apart from 

the connection to the municipal Mass Rapid Transport 

(MRT) &amp; Road systems and public utilities, a modern 

sewage collection and treatment system was built, which, 

together with the Sponge City Solutions (to be elaborated 

later below) improves the surface water quality. As a result, 

within the built-up area, the surface water quality has 

been elevated from Sub-V (unsuitable for irrigation due to 

pollution) to Category III according to the Chinese Surface 

Water classification system; 

• 

Enforcement of high green building standards. 100% of 

the new buildings, including resettlement housing for 

local residents needs to be certified as green building as 

planned. And, the shipyard on the island is converted into 

a public park; 

• 

Adoption of Sponge City solutions towards flood 

prevention. In rainy seasons, the island is susceptible to 

elevated Yangtze River levels and waterlogging at lower-

altitude places. The development team adopts traditional 

flood prevention measures, including reinforced river 

bank, intricate pumping system, separate rain water 

collection pipelines, as well as the Sponge City solutions, 

which emphasise the gravity flow and soil absorption over 

concrete embankment or trenches. In the flooding season 

of FY2020, which was estimated to be a once-in-50-years 

occurrence, the island withstood the flooding and there 

was no serious waterlogging inside the river bank; and 

• 

Function as a pilot zone for carbon-neutralisation 

programs. Owing to the Eco Hi-tech Island’s track record 

in reducing carbon emission, the island is now assuming 

a more proactive role towards carbon-neutralisation in 

urban development and maintenance by the mandate 

issued by the Nanjing Committee of the Communist Party 

of China.

Water withdrawal intensity refers to the total water withdrawal in the year 

divided per Gross Floor Area.

WATER WITHDRAWAL

Freshwater is used for our operations across PRC and Singapore. Water is mainly sourced from the 

respective local third-party water suppliers. It is used in the operation of chillers in our buildings, 

common water features such as toilets, fountains and water sprinklers. Within our hotels, it is used 

for cooking, cleaning and other operations within its premises. 

Water withdrawal - PRC

In FY2020, total water withdrawal was recorded at 681,346 m³, a 9% decrease from 746,619 m³ 

in FY2019. This decrease was mainly due to the reduced activities across our hotels as a result of 

COVID-19. International and domestic flights were halted which affected tourism for the whole of 

PRC. The respective water withdrawal and intensity¹ have been plotted for managed properties 

and hotels and serviced apartments below. 

Water withdrawal – Singapore 

In FY2020, total water withdrawal in Singapore was recorded at 189,220 m³, a 17% decrease from 

227,971 m³ in FY2019. This was due to the lowered activities across our managed properties 

and hotels. Since the introduction of Circuit Breaker in April 2020, most of our tenants and their 

employees began working from home. Even with the gradual reopening of the community by the 

Singapore Government, occupancy within our properties still remained low as most companies 

were telecommuting by default until the end of the year. 

With travel restrictions implemented for most of FY2020, this resulted in a lowered occupancy 

across our hotels and serviced apartments. Comparing with FY2019, we observed an overall 20% 

decrease in water consumed for hotels and serviced apartments in FY2020.

WASTE MANAGEMENT

The scope of waste generation includes all managed properties, hotels and serviced apartments 

in PRC and Singapore. All waste is disposed through licensed third-party contractors in PRC and 

Singapore. Both hazardous and non-hazardous waste would be segregated within the premises 

and collected regularly by the third-party vendors for proposal disposal. Hazardous waste 

comprises of waste cooking oil and batteries from our hotels. Non-hazardous waste comprises of 

domestic waste and recyclables.

Waste Management - PRC

In FY2020, total waste generated from China was at 2,693 tonnes, where 16% comprised of 

hazardous waste. At managed properties, almost only non-hazardous waste was generated, which 

saw a 12% increase from 1,821 tonnes in FY2019 to 2,031 tonnes in FY2020. This was attributed 

to increased use of disposables such as takeaway containers and cutlery. Due to COVID-19, 

employees had to dine in offices or order deliveries. They also spent a longer time within office 

premises. Correspondingly, the intensity also saw an increase from 3.72 kg/m² to 4.17 kg/m².

Waste generated at our hotels and serviced apartments saw a 7% decrease due to the low 

occupancy rate brought about by COVID-19 restrictions. 

A further breakdown of waste types diverted from disposal and diverted to disposal is shown in 

the following table.

Waste Management - Singapore 

In Singapore, only non-hazardous waste comprising general waste and recyclables such as 

paper, plastic, metals and glass were generated and disposed off. Across both years, total waste 

generated has remained constant. Despite travel restrictions resulting in lowered occupancy 

rates, a new stream of waste originating from the use of Personal Protection Equipment which 

includes face masks, face shields, gloves and gowns was part of the waste disposed this year. 

In Singapore, recyclable waste will be segregated at the hotels prior to being sent to recycling 

facilities. Thereafter, waste which is non-recyclable along with the other domestic waste will be 

sent to waste-to-incineration plants. A breakdown of non-hazardous waste diverted from disposal 

and diverted to disposal is provided below.

Energy - Singapore

In Singapore, the main source of fuel at managed properties is electricity. At our hotels and 

serviced apartments, both electricity and fuel (for cooking and operating company’s vehicles) are 

consumed. 

In its efforts to minimise the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore, the Government implemented 

a Circuit Breaker from 7 April 2020 to 1 June 2020 mandating the closure of all non-essential 

businesses and retailers. All employees began working from home. Even as the Circuit Breaker 

measures were lifted, employees still had to telecommute by default. This contributed to a 

sustained period of inactivity across our properties and hotels, resulting in a drop in total energy 

consumed as well.

The total energy consumed fell from 133 TJ in FY2019 to 103 TJ in FY2020. For detailed breakdown 

of energy consumption and intensities by business segments, please refer to the charts below.

ENERGY AND EMISSIONS MANAGEMENT AT YANLORD  

Similar to the reporting scope for water withdrawal and waste generated, data disclosed covers 

Yanlord’s managed properties, hotels and serviced apartments in PRC and Singapore. 

Energy - PRC 

Our primary energy sources include fuel, electricity, steam and cooling. Fuel is mainly used by 

companies’ vehicles in the form of motor gasoline, generators in the form of diesel and natural 

gas is used for boilers. In PRC, the total energy consumption in FY2020 has almost halved 

from 400 TJ to 260 TJ. The respective breakdown for managed properties, hotels and serviced 

apartments can be seen in the charts below. The corresponding drop in energy intensity¹ can also 

be seen in the graph below. Overall, the decrease in energy consumed was largely attributed 

to lowered activities across both commercial and hospitality properties due to the COVID-19 

pandemic.

GHG Emissions - Singapore 

Likewise in Singapore, overall GHG emissions4  has also decreased across our managed 

properties and hotels in FY2020. More notably, GHG emissions in hotels have seen an 31% 

decrease in Scope 1 emissions. This is due to the lowered activity in the kitchen as well as the 

operation of company’s vehicles such as coaches and cars amid the COVID-19 outbreak in 

Singapore.

LOCAL COMMUNITY AND SOCIAL 

INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

At Yanlord, we are committed to being a good corporate 

citizen across all markets we operate in. Cognisant of the 

impacts our businesses may have on the environment 

as well as our local communities, we focus on finding 

balance between meeting expectations of our investors 

and giving back to the community. As we look to 

minimise the negative impacts our operations may bring, 

we are proactive in executing various environmental and 

socially responsible initiatives. 

Community investments are spearheaded by the 

respective offices located across various regions of 

PRC. We support and contribute to the key areas in line 

with social issues currently faced in PRC. They include 

areas of poverty alleviation, especially in less developed 

areas, education, special needs and underprivileged 

communities. Prior to COVID-19, we organised student 

and youth engagement programmes as well as student 

enrichment programmes.

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we responded 

to PRC Government’s call to contribute to Wuhan by 

donating RMB 1 million to the Wuhan Real Estate 

Development Association to aid their fight against the 

outbreak. We are heartened that the situation continues 

to improve in PRC and hope that the world will soon be 

back on track towards normalcy. 

We firmly believe in giving back to the community and 

supporting those in need. We lead by example and have 

made contributions to several charitable causes and 

educational institutions in FY2020. For example, we have 

contributed RMB 20.56 million to Shanghai International 

Studies University for the purpose of education in 

Shenzhen, PRC as community investment.

CASE STUDY: 

2019 SUZHOU CLEAN WATER PROGRAM

Going beyond monetary donations to beneficiaries each 

year, we took the extra mile to serve the local community. In 

FY2019, we launched the Suzhou Clean Water Program and 

sponsored Mother Tang Charity Center, bringing clean water 

to the children living high-altitude areas in the mountainous 

region of Qinghai province. Mother Tang Charity Center is a 

center which has been operating for close to 20 years with 

mission to bring about good health to the children living in the 

mountainous areas. For this program, volunteers took about 

36 hours to reach an altitude of 5,300 meters, delivering clean 

water to children who lack access to clean water. This has 

certainly brought about huge impact to the future generations 

as it effectively improved the environment and quality of 

life for the people and giving strong support to the least 

developed area’s economic and social development. We hope 

that this ripple effect of giving would continue in the years to 

come and spread beyond the region.
