Statement from 

executive Chairman

As a Group, we are constantly looking at how sustainability 

can play a part in our business. Environmental, social 

and corporate governance (ESG) are important to the 

Group as we believe they will enable us to go further and 

make us stronger in the long run. 

This is our second Report and I am pleased to share 

that in the past one year, we have improved. With the 

expansion of our regional presence in the year, we 

have also expanded our reporting to include more from 

our regional units. In addition, we strengthened the 

Sustainability Committee to include more operational 

units so that we have a comprehensive view of the ESG 

efforts of the Group. 

Social responsibility is key to Raffles Medical. As a Group, 

we have chosen to focus on four key pillars, namely 

Customers, Employees, Environment and Marketplace. 

We recognise that our every little effort can play a role in 

making the world a better place to live in.

Growing with our Patients

Patients are at the centre of all that we do. When we 

take good care of our patients, we see the business 



taking care of itself. Our patients and the community we 

serve in are central to our existence. Raffles exists for a 

cause greater than itself – to provide quality healthcare 

to our patients. As such, we seek to create value to the 

community and economy where we operate in. 

2018 saw us expanding Raffles Hospital with the 22-storey 

Raffles Specialist Centre to meet our patients’ growing 

needs. We have used the additional space to expand our 

range of sub-specialty services. In addition, the extension 

will offer a runway for the hospital’s expansion and growth 

for the next 10 years. 

As experts in the healthcare space, we chose to enter the 

Integrated Shield market in August 2018 to offer unique 

solutions that can help resolve issues that are plaguing 

the private shield market. For example, the Raffles 

Hospital Option allows you to enjoy treatment in Raffles 

Hospital without paying full private premiums, while the 

High Deductible Option can complement your company’s 

benefits, resulting in no coverage overlaps and thus, even 

more savings. 

We will continue to review how we can offer sustainable 

and quality services and products to our patients and 

customers to create win-win situations for all. 

Growing with the Community

As a Group, we work closely with the Singapore 

government through collaborations such as the Primary 

(102-14)


9

Care Network and the Emergency Care Collaboration. These 

partnerships help reduce the pressure on the polyclinics and 

hospitals, allowing more to be able to receive the medical 

attention they need promptly at subsidised rates. We support 

government initiatives such as the Community Health Assist 

Scheme (CHAS), Pioneer Generation and the Screen for Life 

schemes to make healthcare more accessible. 

Healthcare organisations are able to support positive health 

outcomes through education and screening. We believe 

healthcare should be lifestyle driven and thus conduct talks 

and seminars, provide health education materials online 

and offline, and offer free and discounted screening to the 

community to encourage healthy living. 

We intend to increase frequency of community activities 

through more structured CSR campaigns and projects both 

locally and regionally, where we have our facilities. 

Growing Digital

In addition to offering exciting new opportunities, we believe 

digital platforms enable us to grow our business without 

growing our carbon footprint. We are constantly looking for 

ways to make healthcare more accessible to our patients 

by connecting with them. With digital platforms such as our 

e-commerce platform, we are able to do so in a sustainable 

manner – digitally, paperless, anytime, anywhere. In 2019, 

we will continue to develop new platforms to connect with our 

patients including paving the way for teleconsultations and 

e-health management. 

Growing Regionally

Growing responsibly has always been one of our strategic 

thrusts. As we expand regionally, we become accountable 

to a greater number of communities. With the opening of 

Raffles Hospital in Chongqing, this continues to be the way 

we do business. 

Selected management staff from Raffles Hospital Singapore 

have been seconded to Raffles Hospital Chongqing to ensure 

that the Hospital draws on established expertise, systems 

and service standards. Some of the locally hired senior staff 

and doctors were sent to Singapore for attachment to ensure 

that they are familiar with Raffles Hospital’s system and 

service model. 

Raffles Hospital Chongqing will draw on Singapore’s expertise 

and clinical resources to develop training and research as 

pillars for its development as an eminent medical centre. 

The Hospital will leverage on the Group’s Raffles Healthcare 

Institute to train local and foreign healthcare professionals, 

including accredited training and clinical attachments for 

local and foreign doctors, nurses, allied health professionals 

and healthcare managers.

The Group will be opening a second hospital in Shanghai, 

Pudong Qiantan in 2019. The two hospitals, strategically 

located in the eastern and western regions of China, offer 

access to the Raffles brand of care within China.

Conclusion

Trust is highly valued by Raffles. The only way to compete 

in this time and age is to be more professional and more 

honest than others. We are grateful for the trust accorded 

to us by our customers, employees, shareholders and the 

Board. As we continue to grow responsibly, we thank you 

for making us your trusted partner for health.

Group also conducted a baseline survey in 2018 

to assess staff perception and understanding to 

Total WSH. The survey resulted in new initiatives 

implemented in addition to the existing and ongoing 

employee health programmes. 

New initiatives in 2018 include:

• Adopt healthy activities at work and at home

  - Participated in the Health Promotion Board (HPB) 

    “National Steps Challenge”

  - Group workout before clinic opening time

• Rec Club promotions

  - Health Talk series during lunch break

  - Gym membership corporate promotion

  - Dragon boat practice

• Training

  - Fatigue management

To achieve a cohesive and innovative WSH culture, 

RMG works together with internal and external 

stakeholders to enhance the safety and health practices. 

Workplace Safety &amp; Health (WSH) Training

WSH-related training is a regular training where 

staff will be equipped with the knowledge on how to 

perform their work safely and efficiently, including 

the importance of competency. One of the training 

programmes i.e. 5S Housekeeping, a common training 

in most industry, has been customised to include 

safety, thus changing it to 6S Housekeeping. Apart 

from imparting knowledge in identifying wastages 

and redundancies to streamline and improve its 

processes and systems, focusing on safety promotes 

stronger staff commitment and ownership. Learning 

outcome is evidenced with submission from each 

participant on the improvement actions carried out at 

their respective department / unit.

Construction Activities for New Hospital extension 

Building and Renovation Work Sites

Adhering to the additions and alterations (A&amp;A) policy, 

all risk assessment and its supporting documents 

submitted by contractors are evaluated prior by the 

Safety team, Facilities team and the Infection Control 

team to ensure all possible WSH risks associated with 

construction and renovation projects are adequately 

addressed. Regular inspections carried out by these 

teams ensure all areas of non-compliance are rectified 

immediately to safeguard the well being of the staff, 

patients and visitors.

Annual Review of Risk Assessments

The Group adopts annual Risk Assessment review, 

which is higher than the national regulatory requirement 

i.e. once in three years. This rigorous effort is to enforce 

and ensure that staff take ownership to 

• Assess their respective work processes and activities

• Identify process change, new workplace hazard and /

  or patient safety concerns

• Revise and update the organisational risk register

The Group has also incorporated SGSecure component 

into its risk assessment to mitigate potential terror 

threats aligning itself to the national movement.

infection contRol 

Emerging infectious diseases are a growing concern. 

With the fast changing trend where remote travelling 

destinations become more accessible, people are 

travelling more frequently and to greater distances. 

Maintaining strong vigilance and surveillance helps 

with early detection and containment of infectious 

diseases outbreak.

Hand Hygiene

In 2018 and its preceding years, emphasis on hand 

hygiene has been relentless. Alcohol handrub 

dispensers are prominently placed and equidistant 

to the next handrub dispenser, giving no room for 

inaccessibility. Coupled with hand hygiene training 

during orientation, induction, update at regular 

meetings, and result sharing, hand hygiene compliance 

reached 91% in 2018, a 4.5% improvement from the 

previous year.

MAYO CLINIC CARe NeTWORK (MCCN)

In 2018, RMG’s engagement with MCCN derived 

several exciting exchanges. Clinical specialty such 

as Oncology, Haematology and Orthopaedics had 

dedicated exchanges on new medical technologies and 

treatment modalities specific to their specialties while 

other specialists conferred with Mayo Clinic experts via 

eConsult. Through the learning and sharing of knowledge 

with MCCN, it enhanced the Group’s treatment and care 

for its patients. From healthcare management to patient 

safety and care delivery, RMG moved forward in areas 

such as nursing leadership structure and governance, 

healthcare management training, clinical trials, research, 

culture of safety, Infection Control standards and 

practices, sustaining JCI, Family Medicine education, 

and Radiology new advances. New areas of interest have 

been lined up for 2019.

tRauMa ceRtified HoSpital 

Raffles Hospital was accredited and certified as a trauma 

hospital by the National Trauma Committee, Singapore 

on 28 June 2018. It is the first private hospital in Singapore 

to undergo the accreditation process.

With this, Raffles Hospital has been assessed to meet 

national standards in trauma patient management both 

locally and regionally. In addition, the 24-Hour Accident &amp; 

Emergency department is equipped and ready to receive 

trauma patients and medical emergencies at any time. It 

has an active mechanism to activate a multi-disciplinary 

trauma team to manage acute trauma patients. 

Supported by more than 100 specialists in Raffles 

Hospital, the Emergency team department sees both 

private patients as well as public patients brought in by 

Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulances 

through the Emergency Care Collaboration (ECC) scheme. 

Air Quality

2018 also saw the hospital undergo massive renovation 

and construction works. With new wards created and an 

entirely new medical centre building connected to the 

existing building, keeping the air clean and in check was a 

priority to prevent outbreaks associated with construction 

dust / fungus such as Aspergillosis and Legionellosis, 

which are susceptible to immuno-compromised patients. 

Devices were installed to aid in cleaning the air in rooms 

that are already equipped with HEPA filters and the 

recommended air exchange. No patient acquired any 

infection associated with construction dust and / or fungus. 

Antimicrobial Stewardship Programme

Raffles Hospital participated in the government-funded 

Phase 1 study on Singapore Point Prevalence on 

Healthcare-associated 

Infections 

and 

Antimicrobial 

Prescriptions. The study was beneficial to Raffles Hospital 

as it helped us validate our infection prevention efforts, 

initiatives and programmes. The report from this study 

enabled us to compare our result to other healthcare 

institutions in Singapore. 

The study also impelled Raffles Hospital to establish 

the Antimicrobial Stewardship Programme, which is 

increasingly becoming inevitable worldwide. Raffles 

Hospital will continue to participate in the Phase 2 of the 

study in 2019, which will focus on –

a) Validation of data collection for the Infection Prevention  

     &amp; Control indicators including hand hygiene compliance 

    for comparability of data;

b) Study the utilisation of isolation room and adequacy of 

     isolation rooms to establish norms and plan for isolation 

    needs; and

c) Review the effectiveness and impact of the 

    recommendations in the ‘Strengthened National 

    Carbapenemase Producing-Carbapenems Resistant 

    Enterobacteriaceae (CP-CRE) Containment Plan.’

CuSTOMeR SeRVICe exCeLLeNCe

The Group replaced paper feedback forms with online 

surveys at all its GP clinics, Health Screeners, Dental 

clinics, RCM clinics, Specialist Outpatient Centres and 

24-Hour Emergency Department. Since the conversion of 

paper feedback forms to online surveys in August 2018, 

we have been receiving a total monthly average of 1,300 

to 1,400 feedback across all channels, as opposed to 850 

to 900 feedback a month before the conversion. 

With the elimination of paper feedback forms in the 

clinics and centres, the Group now has a truer picture of 

its patients’ sentiments of their service experience. The 

larger feedback sample size has also given RMG a more 

accurate measure of its Customer Satisfaction Index.



In 2019, the Group will similarly convert paper feedback 

forms to online surveys in its hospital wards.

e-coMMeRce 

The Group launched an e-commerce service allowing 

patients to purchase their health screening, vaccination, 

health supplements and other medical services online 

before they turn up at the respective medical centres. 

Take up rate has been encouraging as patients find this 

service convenient.

Customer Health &amp; Safety

Being “your trusted partner for health” is RMG’s working ethos to assure best outcomes, providing good value for 

patients, clients and the community. Its group practice model allows healthcare professionals to have a seamless 

coordination across the continuum to deliver safe, effective, timely and patient-centred care. 

Our Challenges

The multidisciplinary set-up drives the Group’s nurses to be versatile and adapt to the demanding care needs. Hence 

training programs have to be rigorous and must commensurate with the care demands and needs. 

Our Success

The institutional group practice model promotes team based care whereby the doctors, nurses and allied health 

professionals work together for the benefit and the interest of the patient.

aSSuRinG beSt outcoMe 

RMG closely monitors patient safety indicators to better 

understand actual and potential issues to improve patient 

care. In additional to the international patient safety 

goals, defined by the JCI, Raffles Hospital also measures 

clinical performance on these key themes: 

• Unscheduled readmission

• Hospital acquired infections

• Falls

• Medication related events

• Surgery related events

• Clinical outcome by speciality

These are then discussed at the respective QA committees.

Clinical Audits

Clinical audits are done as part of the Group’s medical 

professional clinical governance. In addition to mortality 

and morbidity review, the following committees look into 

the different areas of clinical quality programmes:

• Medical Audit Committee

• Surgical Audit Committee

• Pharmacy &amp; Therapeutics Committee

• Infection Control Committee

• Operating Theatre Committee

• Blood Transfusion and Tissue Review Committee

• Patient Case Review Committee

• Critical Care Committee

• Trauma Committee

• Transplant Committee

The Quality Committee, who has the overall oversight of 

these committees, reviews and evaluates their activities 

and programmes with collective decision that benefits the 

organisation to promote patient safety. 

Clinical Resource utilisation 

Resource utilisation is embedded in the QA committee’s 

terms and reference to continually look into accessibility 

to the services through the use of data. This allows Raffles 

Hospital to optimise limited resources to accommodate 

patients’ needs.

Incident Reporting

Leadership supports healthcare professionals across all 

spectrums in Raffles Hospital to speak up and report any 

event, process or condition that causes harm or has the 

potential to cause harm or injury. These are opportunities 

to improve current practices to prevent future occurrences.

There is proactive review for clinical incidences / 

feedbacks where a team of healthcare professionals 

relevant to that process to come together for general 

consensus following an in depth deliberation. There is a 

process for group-wide escalation and standardisation.

Quality Promotion - Building a Quality Culture

Clinical:

• Annual Infection Control cum Quality Day 

• Annual World Hand Hygiene Day

• Infection Control Liaison Coordinators

• Basic / Advance Infection Control Course

• Advance Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Course

• E-learning Courses

Operations / Services:

• Training in Workplace Safety, JCI, Quality Tools

• Service quality

• Inter departmental sharing of projects and highlights 

Additionally, to promote transparent public reporting, 

Raffles Hospital subscribes to MOH’s clinical surveillance 

and reporting.

Build a seamless service

• Ensuring continuity of care is provided to the patient  

  as he / she is referred to a service which best meets his 

  needs. The patient is able to move easily from primary 

  services to tertiary services and back to primary services to 

  optimise value for the patient. There is a follow through 

  throughout the process as RMG adopts team-based care.

ACCReDITATION &amp; COLLABORATION 

Joint Commission International (JCI)

Raffles Hospital has been accredited by the JCI since 2008; 

a strong testament of its commitment to patient safety and 

care continuity. 

Staff adhere to the six International Patient Safety Goals 

(IPSG) as follows: 

IPSG 1 - Identify patients correctly

IPSG 2 - Improve effective communication

IPSG 3 - Improve the safety of high-alert medications

IPSG 4 - Ensure safe surgery

IPSG 5 - Reduce the risk of 

               healthcare-associated infections

IPSG 6 - Reduce the risk of patient harm resulting 

 

  from falls

The JCI standards are revised every three years to 

ensure that they remain current and address the changing 

healthcare demands for better care and patient safety. 

Raffles Hospital is accredited to the JCI latest 6th edition 

standards. The 6th edition, which includes several new 

requirements, raises the expectations and stimulates 

Raffles Hospital to deliver care that is evidence-based, 

uniformed, and of high standard taking in consideration 

the local needs, its law and regulation, and its diverse 

culture and religion.

Mayo Clinic Care Network (MCCN)

The Group is the first in Asia to join the Mayo Clinic back in July 2015. This collaboration meant that RMG’s doctors 

can use electronic communication tools to access the latest Mayo Clinic knowledge and expertise for the benefit of 

our patients. This collaboration also promotes physician teamwork, complementing local expertise. 

The Group was selected to join the MCCN because of the shared philosophy, commitment and mission to improve 

the delivery of health care through high-quality, data-driven, evidence-based medical care and treatment. In addition, 

the Group has also passed Mayo Clinic’s rigorous review process based on quality, service and operational criteria.

The MCCN is a unique collaboration that connects RMG with Mayo Clinic’s subject experts and resources. Under 

the collaboration, there are regular exchanges of knowledge between our specialists and Mayo Clinic doctors. 

Bridging the finest medical expertise from Mayo Clinic to RMG, the MCCN offers RMG’s patients easy access to 

experts from Mayo Clinic without the need to travel.

emergency Care Collaboration

Raffles Hospital is the first and only private hospital in 

Singapore to take in subsidised care patients brought 

in by SCDF ambulances through the ECC scheme with 

the Ministry of Health. Since June 2015, the hospital has 

attended to and treated many patients who pay subsidised 

Class C rates. Government subsidies help defray some of 

the costs. In this way, RMG contributes to the national 

effort in ensuring that Singaporeans receive the needed 

care in a timely manner. 

As the collaboration has proven fruitful, MOH signed a 

five-year extension with Raffles Hospital in 2018. The 

extended scope includes Raffles Hospital’s 24 Hour 

Emergency being accredited by MOH to take in trauma 

cases. This allows more Singaporeans to benefit from 

the collaboration. To improve patient care, the hours of 

service were extended from 8am to 4pm, to 7am to 5pm.

cHaS

All Raffles Medical and Raffles Dental clinics participate 

in the PG and CHAS subsidy programmes to support the 

Singapore government’s efforts to serve the less privileged 

in the community. The Government introduced the PG 

Package in 2014 to honour and thank the pioneers for 

their hard work and dedication. About 450,000 Singapore 

citizens will benefit from the PG Package, which will help 

them with their healthcare costs for life.

CLINICAL R&amp;D 

Raffles Hospital is currently participating several clinical 

trials. These are in the areas of Chemotherapy medication, 

Haematology and Oncology. Participants are able to 

access latest, cutting medication through participation 

in these trials. Raffles Hospital is also supporting 

observational studies, where anonymised patient data is 

gleaned to improve patient outcomes.

acceSS to patient education infoRMation

The Group creates and shares publicly on various 

platforms patient education information that can be 

beneficial to patients and members of the public. These 

platforms include the corporate website, social media 

including Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, electronic 

direct mailers and printed brochures and materials. 

Patients are provided with relevant patient education 

information when required or requested. 

IT Systems 

The Group invests substantially in IT systems to provide safer 

medical care and delivering value to its patients. RMG strives 

to achieve this in a socially ethical and environmentally green way. 

Out of many, the two main RMG enterprise systems are:

(1) Raffles Clinic Management System (RCMS)

(2) Electronic Medical Records (EMR)

The main scope of RCMS is clinic management and operations 

functions: registration, billing &amp; dispensing. On the other 

hand, EMR facilitates the Medical &amp; Consultation workflows. 

The two systems interface with each other seamlessly.

The systems cut down the reliance on paper significantly. 

Registration, consultation, prescribing, retrieval of lab &amp; 

radiology reports are a few of the paperless workflows. 

EMR provides all the benefits of a centralised system. Medical 

records are instantly available for consults at any RMG clinic 

island wide. Once a clinician specifies a medical alert such 

as allergies, it is immediately effective and clinicians will be 

alerted for subsequent visits.

Furthermore, RCMS and EMR have built in customised 

workflows for joint initiatives with the Government such as 

ECC or others like CHAS and Primary Care Network (PCN):

• While RCMS can automatically check the CHAS benefits of 

  a patient, EMR will alert physicians if a patient has a chronic 

  diagnosis history and is eligible for PCN scheme. 

• When a PCN diabetes patient is due for lab blood test, EMR 

  will alert the physician.

RMG’s IT systems are constantly being enhanced. The Group 

listens to patients and employees to review the processes 

and realign the systems.

Our Approach and Targets

In 2018, the Group focused its attention on overseas hiring and establishing common standards for 

its employees, an important step as it continues to expand its services regionally. 

From 2019, the Group will conduct annual basic health screening and seasonal influenza vaccina-

tions for all employees to support their wellbeing. The annual screenings would give employees 

and the Group more data points to provide interventions to improve their health. 

The RMG scholarship was launched in 2012 to groom healthcare professional and business lead-

ers. As the Group continues to expand its regional presence, it will offer scholarships to both local 

and international students over the next three years with the aim of nurturing a pipeline of talents 

who can be posted to its overseas offices.

In addition, a committee has been tasked to implement talent review and talent management to 

develop leaders through overseas postings.

HIRING, ReCRuITMeNT &amp; ReTeNTION (401-1)

In 2018, RMG took efforts to develop a talent pool for 

its new facility, Raffles Hospital in Chongqing. Various 

avenues and platforms were tapped on to extend 

outreach to professionals from different countries 

and medical specialties. Flexible modes of interviews 

were carried out to suit the profile of its candidates. 

This includes video calls through social platforms 

such as WeChat, Skype or WhatsApp, and face-to-

face interviews in Singapore or in Chongqing. To 

date, the medical panel and management of Raffles 

Hospital Chongqing comprise a mix of reputable 

local professionals and top international talents in the 

healthcare industry including specialists, physicians, 

nurses, allied health professionals and managers from 

Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, Australia, 

Canada, Britain and Europe. 

tRaininG and education (404)

In 2018, Raffles Healthcare Institute (RHCI) offered 

2,192 training places for RMG employees, who 

attended training courses and workshops organised 

by the 11 training divisions of RHCI, which comprise 

Specialist Medicine, Family Medicine, Dental, Nursing, 

Allied Health, Life Support, Quality Management, and 

General Management.

RHCI leveraged on the Group’s collaboration with 

Mayo Clinic and invited Senior Advisers from Mayo’s 

teaching faculty to facilitate workshops on service 

leadership and human resource management.

In addition, 20 Supervisors were groomed by RHCI 

through the fifth intake of Supervisory Training 

Programme (STP) between July and November 2018, 

showcasing four workplace improvement projects.

During the year, in-house courseware were refined to 

incorporate blended learning and experiential modes 

of facilitation, leveraging on e-learning to complement 

classroom facilitation. Customer centricity elements 

were infused to clinical and professional practice to 

enhance personable service. 

 

As the Group expanded into China, RHCI broadened 

its outreach by extending its in-house curriculum to 

Raffles Hospital in Chongqing. Selected curricula 

were translated and contextualised to meet the 

learning needs of employees in China. 

Trips were organised to Chongqing to deliver 

customised 

onboarding 

and 

service 

training 

programmes to induct new hires, introduce them to 

RMG’s core values and culture, and to propagate 

the service standards of the Group. These sessions 

served as Train-The-Trainer Sessions, empowering 

the regional team to sustain future runs for its 

employees.

The investment in local and regional training 

exemplifies the enduring commitment of RHCI to 

grow and develop the Group’s employees, with the 

goal of improving the quality of healthcare.










28

We CARe 

To maintain the Group’s high service standards, 

a Group-wide service campaign was launched in 

Singapore in August 2018. The We Care campaign 

aims to enable employees to live up to the Group’s 

core values and service charter. Following positive 

feedback from employees, the campaign will be 

rolled out to the Group’s overseas units in 2019.

GRooMinG StandaRdS

Following the change of uniform in 2017 and as 

part of the Group’s pursuit for service excellence, 

an updated grooming guide was published in 2018 

to align employees to a common set of grooming 

standards. The guide includes frontline and 

backroom employees and covers areas such as 

uniform, hair, accessories and footwear.

for employees to participate in a wide range of 

physical activities, health seminars and healthy 

cooking classes at their workplace. 







SGSecuRe

The Group invited the Singapore Police Force to give a 

talk on SGSecure in November and December 2018. All 

employees are encouraged to download the SGSecure 

app which would allow them to keep track of terrorist 

related news or emergencies that may affect the Group. 

Training was also provided to employees on how to 

respond and handle emergency situations related to 

terrorists’ attacks.

The Group will be planning joint exercises in 2019 with the 

authorities to strengthen its response to emergency situations.

RMG wants to be an employer of choice. The ability to 

continuously attract, retain and develop talent is the key 

to the Group’s success. Its core values of compassion, 

commitment, excellence, team-based care and value 

(CCETV) underpin how it does business. Each member 

of its medical, clinical, administrative and support teams 

brings a level of experience, expertise and commitment to 

patient care that is unmatched in its industry.

HIRING, ReCRuITMeNT &amp; ReTeNTION

The Group recognises that recruitment can prove 

challenging in some areas including nursing and allied 

health positions due to the opening of new hospitals and 

a shortage of suitably qualified healthcare professionals. 

In this regard, it regularly partners with e2i, Workforce 

Singapore, local universities, polytechnics and ITE to 

provide employment opportunities.

As part of its strategy to attract and retain diverse 

talent, RMG offers employees a range of flexible work 

arrangements (FWAs) that enable them to work efficiently 

and have time for personal pursuits. These include flexi-

time, part-time work, contract basis, project-based work, 

amongst others. The application process for FWAs has 

been simplified to encourage take-up rate. This has made 

the organisation, attractive to individuals with personal 

responsibilities, including working mothers.

One key thrust of the HR policy is the formalised, structured 

selection process that RMG has devised for the screening 

and hiring of new employees. Interviewers are provided 

with clear written guidelines that include recruitment &amp; 

selection, hiring, retirement and re-employment policies 

and a standard method to assess competencies. 



29

Employee retention practices are also formalised in 

written policy, for easy reference by staff. These include 

a grievance handling workflow, disciplinary, whistle-

blowing and performance management policies as well 

as training and development programmes.

Employees can be expected to be treated fairly and to 

receive prompt responses to problems and concerns. 

For this reason, RMG provides a grievance procedure to 

promote prompt and responsible resolution of issues raised 

by employees and line managers.

Scholarship

In 2018, four students were awarded the RMG Scholarship. 

These students are pursuing nursing, physiotherapy and 

business management courses. In total, the Group has 

granted 34 scholarships.

tRaininG and education (404)

Employees are part of the Group’s human capital, 

and their competencies are fundamental to RMG’s 

operational effectiveness. RMG aims to develop 

their potential to drive innovation and organisational 

excellence. As an employer, RMG finds ways to 

engage staff to support them in delivering in the future. 

As a healthcare business, the Group has great staff in 

all locations and at all levels. 

The Group strongly believes in developing people 

by growing its own timber. It will continue to invest 

in developing all staff – both through the specific 

knowledge and skills they need to do their jobs. Building 

world-class staff and capabilities will not only help the 

business, it will also support the employer brand.

The Group has a tailored training and development 

support for its diverse workforce via a structured 

Total Learning Plan for all staff, developed through 

a transparent, systematic Learning Needs Analysis 

process. Staff are valued for their performance and 

competence on the job, and the management focuses 

on helping staff identify their core strengths, along with 

raising their knowledge and skill levels. This is done 

through various training initiatives such as professional 

coaching, mentoring, on-the-job training, cross-training 

in multiple functions, as well as job rotation. 

It is vital for employees to keep themselves abreast 

of the latest technological and industry developments. 

The Group is constantly creating opportunities 

for staff to grow through continuous training and 

professional development. Employees are given the 

opportunity to upgrade their skills and qualifications 

through sponsorship of training courses and academic 

programmes. The acquisition of professional skills and 

knowledge empowers staff to add greater value in 

their respective roles and to enhance service quality to 

patients and customers. 

32

RMG is also represented in the national WSH 

Council (Healthcare) that works closely with the 

Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and other government 

agencies, the industry, unions, and professional 

associations to develop strategies to raise WSH 

standards in Singapore.

RMG regularly assess potential health and safety 

risks, take preventive measures and increase 

employee awareness about safety. The Hospital 

QA Committee and Safety and Health committee 

periodically review safety and health policies, 

procedures and practices. The Risk Assessment 

Team works with the appointed Risk Management 

Champions to assess risks for every work activity and 

process carried out at the workplace.

RMG conducts regular workplace safety and 

health training to enhance staff competency and 

awareness. E-learning programmes were also 

developed to ensure that all staff are orientated to 

workplace safety and health knowledge. The safety 

and health committee provides oversight for staff-

related incidents. 

For employee wellness, all employees have 

access to EAP which includes a free helpline and 

confidential counselling service to address personal 

or work-related problems directly with a counsellor 

or referred specialist.







employees


33

All employees will receive ongoing in-service education, 

training and developmental opportunities to increase 

their competency level to meet patient needs and perform 

greater job responsibilities for career advancements. 

Medical staff need to meet the compulsory Continuing 

Medical Education (CME) which consists of educational 

activities that helps those in the medical field maintain 

competence and learn about new and developing areas 

of their field. Dental professionals will need to fulfil the 

Continuing Professional Education (CPE) hours for 

renewal of license. Nursing staff also pursue CPE to 

maintain their competencies through various nursing 

educational activities.

In line with the Group’s core values of excellence, team 

based care and value, it seeks to give patients the best 

in medical and nursing care. RMG’s doctors and nurses 

attend periodically local and overseas conferences to 

stay abreast of the latest updates in technology and 

practices. This ensures RMG is on the forefront of care 

delivery for the benefit of its patients.

As the Group grows geographically, it supports internal 

mobility, job rotations and other experiential learning 

opportunities. Staff can move within departments 

and across businesses or geographies to gain lateral 

exposure or acquire different skillsets and experience. 

Raffles Healthcare Institute (RHCI)

RHCI was set up on 1 July 2013 with the objectives 

of supporting RMG’s growing manpower development 

needs, and contributing to training of local and foreign 

healthcare professionals to increase competency and 

professionalism.

33



As the training arm of RMG, the RHCI leverages on the 

expanding base of clinical and management expertise and 

resources of Raffles Hospital and the network of specialists, 

family medicine and dental clinics.

In addition, its institutionally-based group practice model 

affords a structure of clinical leadership and governance 

and a membership of medical staff which supports teaching 

and education.

RHCI brings together all the training initiatives and activities 

for medical, dental, nursing, allied health, and healthcare 

management under one umbrella. For ease of reference, 

RHCI has organised the training programmes under the 

following categories: 

• Medical 

• Dental 

• Nursing 

• Allied Health 

• Life Support Training 

• Healthcare - General and Management 

RHCI currently offers programmes in CME, clinical 

attachments for nursing and allied health students and 

trainees, courses and workshops related to clinical skills, 

patient safety, service quality, healthcare management, and 

professional and continuing education.

As the Group grow geographically, continuous learning 

opportunities are created for staff as they move within 

departments and across businesses or regions, equipping 

them with a myriad of skillsets to prime them for their 

respective new roles.

Our Approach and Targets

In 2018, RMG continued to focus on ways the business can reduce its environmental footprint and 

energy cost. We promoted the efficient use of resources and energy through systematic monitor-

ing and management. Efforts were made to improve buildings under the Group to be greener and 

universally accessible. 

Moving forward, the Group commits to undertake utilities tracking for all properties under the 

Group. With better understanding of usage levels, it will be able to propose different methodology 

and controls to reduce overall consumption.

environment


35

Management of energy

Power meters have been installed on all completed floors 

for better management of energy consumption in Raffles 

Hospital. Other floors will follow suit as A&amp;A works in 

Raffles Hospital continue in 2019. 

Move to Digital 

In the Group’s bid to reduce printing and manpower cost 

for hardcopy posters, digital panels have been installed in 

90% of all clinics outside Raffles Hospital. This move also 

allows for speedy sharing of information to our patients. 

The platform also allows for multiple health education 

content to be shared at any one time. All new clinics are 

equipped with digital panels.

WASTe MINIMISATION

The general waste consumption index has improved from 

0.023 in 2017 to 0.018 in 2018. The Group notes that with 

new food and beverage outlets opening in the Raffles 

Specialist Centre, food waste generated has increased. 

The Group is working with the tenants to manage the situation. 

With more planned A&amp;A works in 2019, construction 

waste is another key area that the Group will focus on in 

the new financial year. 

Recycling

With increased awareness in sustainability, the Group 

launched a pilot recycling programme in Raffles Specialist 

Centre by installing recycling boxes in the Specialist 

Clinics. In 2018, RMG achieved an increase of 53% in its 

annual recycled volume.

Moving forward, the Group is looking at expanding the 

recycling projects to all properties of RMG.

RMG is constantly looking for initiatives to go green and 

will be exploring changing disposable consumables to 

recycled products, such as styrofoam cups to paper cups. 



Achievements in 2018

WATeR (303-3)

Collaboration with PuB 

In 2018, the Group worked closely with Public 

Utilities Board (PUB) to establish a process for any 

water emergency situation in Raffles Hospital. With 

recommendations from PUB, the Group installed 

several emergency pipe connectors and would be 

able to connect PUB external water sources should 

the hospital experience a water emergency situation. 

New water meters were installed in hospital which 

allow us to identify areas of usage which was not 

possible previously. 

As the Group invested in water saving sensors, the 

overall water consumption per square metre of space 

has decreased from 2.11m3 in 2017 to 1.89m3 in 2018.

Water usage for building equipment increased due to 

the installation of new water-cooled chillers that have 

high water consumption but in turn provide higher 

energy efficiency.

eneRGy (302-1, 302-2, 302-4, 302-5)

Notwithstanding the opening of the Raffles Specialist 

Centre in January 2018, the Group was able to reduce 

electricity consumption by 2%. 

Other energy conservation efforts include changing 

lightings to energy saving lights for facilities under 

the Group. With the completion of A&amp;A works for 

levels 2, 10 and 13 of Raffles Hospital, all lights have 

been changed to LED lighting as part of the Group’s 

effort to conserve energy. This is estimated to save 

15,000kwh in energy per year.

universal Design

In an effort to build a safe environment for the public, 

the Group has embarked on a voluntary Building and 

Construction Authority Universal Design (BCA UD) 

certification scheme for its new buildings in Singapore. 

UD buildings have user-friendly provisions to ensure 

safety and accessibility for all, including barrier-free 

accessibility for those with disability.

In 2018, Raffles Holland V Mall was accorded the BCA 

UD certification as it was deemed to have UD features 

such as braille / tactile handrails and indicators, non-

slip nosing flooring, proper way finding signage, step-

less entry to mall, bicycle parking lots, handicap toilets, 

baby changing room as well as persons with disability 

evacuation lobby. 

Raffles Specialist Centre is in the midst of getting 

certification for BCA UD certification with similar 

features as in Raffles Holland V Mall.

Construction Quality Assessment (CONQuAS)

BCA has reviewed the Group’s construction quality in 

architectural, structural and mechanical, and electrical 

installations. Raffles Specialist Centre was awarded the 

CONQUAS certification with a score of 92 out of 100. 



Several facilities in the Raffles Specialist 

Centre are fitted with user friendly features.

One of it is the braille tactile buttons in 

our new lifts which enable those visually 

impaired to identify the floor numbering.

The fire escape staircases handrails are 

also installed with braille tactile.

Metal railings are installed along 

ramp or areas with gradients to assist 

patients or people with disability.

conservation and works with PUB regularly to 

identify areas of improvement in Raffles Hospital in 

Singapore. With the help of appropriate monitoring 

systems, the Group is able to identify high water 

consumption areas and implement the appropriate 

measures to reduce water consumption.

RMG has set up a recycling point in 

the hospital building to encourage all 

our staff to recycle all paper waste. 

The central collection point makes it 

convenient for staff to deposit their non-

confidential documents for recycling.

WASTe MINIMISATION (306)

As the Group grows, the Group is conscious of its 

annual waste volume. 

The Group is actively working with the National 

Environment Agency’s (NEA) two key thrusts 

on waste minimisation and recycling under the 

integrated solid waste management system. 

Throughout the years, new waste minimisation 

systems are in place to reduce prints and to 

promote a more sustainable society.

The Group is pro-actively exploring recyclable 

consumables and materials to do its part for the 

environment. All staff are encouraged to recycle 

their papers with recycling bins located conveniently 

within the facilities.

As a healthcare organisation, RMG 

appreciates the importance of having a clean 

and green environment for greater sustainability 

and health benefits. 

RMG continually looks into ways to reduce 

our environmental footprint and energy cost. 

As such, the Group is committed to regular 

audits and corrective actions to reduce any 

adverse environmental impact. It promotes 

the efficient use of resources and energy, as well 

as continually improve the management of its 

surrounding environment.


40



Our Approach and Targets

In 2018, the Group continued to grow financially and contributed positively to the economy through 

creation of rewarding jobs in Singapore and regionally. Through efficient use of resources coupled 

with strong financial management, it was able to grow responsibly as a company in order to pro-

vide its staff, shareholders and partners with positive economic returns. 

RMG’s doctors, dentists and nurses continued to engage in community outreach activities such as 

conducting basic health screening sessions, giving health education talks and advice on healthy 

ageing to senior citizens and distributing masks at community centres in various parts of Singa-

pore. Talk participants are encouraged to share their knowledge among their social circles, thereby 

raising the awareness of healthy ageing in the community. Our doctors are also involved in running 

clinics for foreign workers on a regular basis.

In addition, we invested in strategic corporate social responsibility programmes to contribute to the 

well-being of the Singapore community. 

Moving forward, the Group targets to maintain a financially strong and healthy balance sheet and 

cash flow to create long-term value for its stakeholders.

RaffleS SHield 

As part of the Group’s strategic expansion plan, 

Raffles Health Insurance entered into the integrated 

shield market by launching the Raffles Shield in 

August 2018. The main aim of the Raffles Shield is 

to provide hospital and surgical coverage, as well as 

promote healthcare by providing policyholders access 

to affordable health management and wellness 

programs. Raffles Shield is intended to encourage 

responsible and appropriate healthcare consumption 

across various stakeholders to reduce premiums 

payable by policyholders in the long run. Entering 

the integrated shield plan market will allow the Group 

to expand its customer base upstream and increase 

sales on both the insurance and health fronts, in 

addition to creating a positive impact on the industry 

by addressing certain gaps in the market.

LOCAL VeNDORS

To support local vendors, the Group chose to 

procure from Chinese local suppliers for Raffles 

Hospital Chongqing. The Group maintained the 

local-based suppliers procurement level at 99% in 

terms of expenditure and supplier-based for local-

based suppliers. This allows us to give back to the 

community where we operate in. 

pRocuReMent 

Raffles Hospital in Chongqing adopts similar 

procurement practices and procedures as Singapore, 

while incorporating their local customs and regulations. 

GReeN INVeSTMeNTS 

In its recent A&amp;A works at levels 1, 2, 10 and 13 of 

Raffles Hospital, the Group spent close to half a million 

dollars on green investments – expenditure that has 

positively direct or indirect impact on environment 

and are potentially cost saving in the long run. These 

include water saving sensors and energy saving lights.
