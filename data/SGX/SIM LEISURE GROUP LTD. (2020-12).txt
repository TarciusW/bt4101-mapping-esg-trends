Diversity and Equal Opportunity

Sim Leisure Group is an equal opportunity employer, and it strongly advocates for non-

discrimination to employees and applicants without regard to discriminatory factors such as

gender, age, race or religion in order to create a diverse, healthy and productive organisation.

As such, it is SLG’s policy to provide equal opportunity in recruitment of employees, career

development, training, promotion and rewards for all employees. This is essential in upholding a

meritocratic environment and developing talent for the long-term success of the organisation. For

FY2020, the ratio of average renumeration women to men ratio for Sim Leisure Group’s employees

is at 1.1 to 1.

Anti-corruption

Sim Leisure Group has a zero-tolerance policy towards any form of corruption. These include, but

are not limited to, kickbacks, gifts, entertainment, favours, hospitality, and donations. Corruption is

prevalent in the tourism sector, handicapping honest industry players and rewarding those based

on bribery. This ultimately deprives customers of their value and quality of leisure, and this is why

SLG takes a strong, vocal stance against corruption. Eliminating corruption is vital to a better world

for all.

Sim Leisure Group promotes the ESCAPE theme parks as scam-free tourist attractions to instill

confidence among visitors on our ethical business conduct, as well as to raise awareness to the

public on the ongoing endemic of corruption. ESCAPE’s website has a dedicated page to inform the

public on corruption in this industry, as well as the park’s stance against such practices.

SLG is committed to conducting business ethically in compliance with all applicable laws (including

the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Act), and undertakes measures to prevent any acts of corruption

within the Group or entities acting on SLG’s behalf. In FY2020, Sim Leisure Group had zero public

cases or incidence of corruption and strives to maintain zero incidents of corruption in the

subsequent years.

Upholding Safety and Quality

Safety is at the heart of Sim Leisure Group. To uphold benchmark international standards in its

workplace safety, SLG’s occupational health and safety management operations at ESCAPE

Penang and ESCAPE Petaling Jaya parks adhere to the ISO 45001 : 2018 management system.

Sim Leisure Group takes a proactive approach in preventing workplace accidents by implementing

the following measures in accordance to ISO 45001 system:

•

Establish a Health and Safety Committee comprising management, representatives of workers

and representatives of employer, and define the Committee’s roles, responsibilities and

authorities

•

Conduct Hazards Identification, Risk Assessment and Risk Control (HIRARC) study to identify

potential risks, identify current safety controls, and take necessary action factoring in likelihood

and severity in judging risks

•

Conduct general safety and health inspections at least every three months on general safety

and health issues, potential unsafe conditions or unsafe situations

•

Establish procedures for employees to immediately and efficiently report to the management

workplace incidents, internal or external, that could have (potential) or had (actual) resulted in

safety and health hazards including: death, bodily injury, disease

•

Promote a workplace culture that prioritises health &amp; safety by training all employees on SLG’s

Occupational Health and Safety Policy and communicating workplace safety procedures

relevant to their job scope

SLG’s ESCAPE parks complies with all legal requirements in Malaysia in respect of occupational

safety and health procedures and employee’s health records including:

•

Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994

•

Factory and Machinery Act 1967

•

Fire Services Act 1988

•

Penang Island Municipal Council By-laws

•

Personal Data Protection Act 2010

Sim Leisure Group also adheres to the IS0 9001 : 2015 Quality Management System across ESCAPE

theme parks to uphold benchmark international standards and ensure consistent quality in the

products and services it provides.

The attractions across ESCAPE theme parks have been built according to the Association for

Challenge Course Technologies (ACCT) installation guidelines and all relevant requirements of the

latest Euro Norm Standards: EN 15567 for rope courses and EN 12572 for artificial climbing

structures.

SLG implements a rigorous safety audit and preventative maintenance schedules at ESCAPE parks

to ensure that all attractions are inspected and serviced on a regular basis and prior to each

opening day.

Economic and Social Goals

Communal Living and

Shared Responsibility

Sim Leisure Group always strives to bring a positive impact to the local communities it engages

with. An example is ESCAPE Penang, which is situated within the Teluk Bahang community.

When developing ESCAPE Penang, Sim Leisure Group factored in the consideration of ethics, social

responsibility, and reducing dependency on external resources. ESCAPE Penang desires to be

transparent and is committed to its local community by supporting local businesses and employing

local staff. ESCAPE Penang is currently the community’s largest employer, and in fact, the majority

of ESCAPE Penang’s workforce comprises those from the Teluk Bahang community.

Sim Leisure Group intends to replicate the communal impact in other regions of expansion

domestically and internationally, as this approach can yield a greater return beyond commercial

gain, making communities more economically equitable and resilient.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2020

SIM LEISURE GROUP LTD.

Energy Conservation

Conventional

theme

parks

worldwide

require

colossal

amount

of

energy

to

ensure

the

smoothrunning of their rides and facilities, amounting to significant carbon emissions and large

overhead costs. Sim Leisure Group recognises the industry’s continuous development of bigger,

faster, scarier mechanical rides in the pursuit of grandeur and scale. In addition to the large carbon

emissions, attractions requiring over-spec technology require a large capital expenditure, along

with an expensive, cumbersome operating and maintenance costs.

Sim Leisure Group departs from the approach of sophisticated high-tech rides, as manifested in

ESCAPE theme parks. SLG adopts a low-tech, high-fun approach in designing its rides and

attractions, placing an emphasis on self-powered and self-directed play to re-introduce the

outdoor play of yesteryear to today’s generation. SLG believes that fun comes from play and all it

needs is imagination and creativity, which are key in developing and operating attractions with a

minimal carbon footprint.

Low-Tech, High-Fun Rides

Conventional mechanical rides such as roller

coasters require a copious amount of energy to

operate. On the other hand, many of ESCAPE’s

and ESCAPE Challenge’s attractions do not

require electricity at all. These include:

•

Monkey

Business:

signature

rope

and

obstacle course comprising 111 challenges

and ziplines navigating guests through the

rainforest.

•

Aerobat: flying trapeze attraction where

visitors swing while strapped on a safety

belt.

•

Flying Lemur: zipline attraction 35 metres

above the ground and spanning 150 metres

across the park.

•

Coco Climb: a coconut tree where guests

strapped on safety harnesses literally climb

to the treetop.

•

Hill Rider: downhill trike ride which starts

from the top of the Gravityplay component

Centrifugal Pumps

ESCAPE Penang runs 13 units of centrifugal

pumps, totalling to 143kW capacity, to circulate

water.

All water parks require a large amount of

energy to ensure the entire water volume is

circulated, sanitized, and filtered every 2 hours

to preserve water hygiene. The series of pumps,

however, only operate at 50% capacity as they

are manually monitored and tuned to match

the intensity of pool use by visitors.

Conventional motors which drive the pumps

are typically “brushless” hence lower air flow

and oscillatory instabilities develop when they

operate at low speed. This causes overheating

and demands more energy to operate the

pumps.

To overcome this inefficiency, ESCAPE Penang’s

filtering and pumping systems are enhanced

with

artificial

intelligence

based

sensorless

Vector Control Drive to reduce electromagnetic

interference, provide superior regulation at low

speed, and better dynamic response.

Zero Cooling Costs

Indoor attractions consume copious amounts

of

electricity

for

air-conditioning.

However,

ESCAPE

theme

park’s

indoor

counterpart

ESCAPE

Challenge,

which

typically

occupy

urban

settings

such

as

shopping

malls,

situates itself at outdoor, sheltered areas of the

mall.

Therefore, this setup saves ESCAPE Challenge

the need for cooling, bringing electricity costs

for

air-conditioning

to

zero.

Furthermore,

ESCAPE Challenge also plants trees to provide

additional cooling and natural shade.



Wave Ball

A typical wave pool uses a pneumatic system,

which

requires

at

least

100kW

to

generate

waves. ESCAPE Penang uses a “wave ball” which

only requires 4kW to generate waves.

The wave ball has a low voltage electric motor,

which drives the ball mass up and down to

generate

waves

in

accordance

with

the

resonance principle. This approach minimises

energy

consumption

while

maximising

the

effect produced.

ESCAPE Penang is the first water park in Asia to

use this Wave Ball technology.





The Wave Ball technology consumes 96% less energy than pneumatic systems at wave pools.



ESCAPE Challenge requires zero energy cost for cooling.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2020

SIM LEISURE GROUP LTD.

Habitat Restoration

Sim Leisure Group pioneered the ESCAPE brand of theme parks based on outdoor play in the

natural environment. ESCAPE takes the green, low-impact approach to its development because it

is the most natural approach - regardless of the prom and pageantry of green certification.

Sim Leisure Group avoids developing ESCAPE theme parks in untouched forests, instead opting for

leftover brownfields allowing SLG to rejuvenate the land with ESCAPE theme parks. This is the case

with ESCAPE Penang, which was previously a leftover brownfield comprising abandoned office

buildings, workers’ quarters and warehouses from the Teluk Bahang Dam construction in 1998. SLG

adopted a low-impact, green approach to building ESCAPE Penang to revitalise the neglected site.

Tree Planting

ESCAPE Penang has planted more than 3,000 trees in the park, including 300 coconut trees,

Angsana (Pterocarpus indicus), Ketapang (Terminalia catappa), and Acacia.

So far, ESCAPE Penang has transplanted 104 trees in the playpark at around RM6800 per tree. These

trees, originally from construction sites where they would have been cut down, are on average 50

years old and weigh between 15 and 42 tonnes each.

Additionally, ESCAPE Penang is targeting to launch a “tree adoption” programme in December 2021

which encourages land owners to contact ESCAPE Penang for transplanting unwanted trees from

their lands to sites operated by ESCAPE.

Rainwater Harvesting

Most land development projects have concrete, asphalt, building roofs, and compacted vegetated

sites which increase rainwater runoff and decrease surface water quality and groundwater

infiltration. ESCAPE Penang’s biomimicry approach allows rainwater to seep into the ground to

support groundwater recharge.

ESCAPE Penang does not construct its pathways and bare surfaces with cement or asphalt, using

layers of natural sand, pebbles, and small rocks at least 20cm deep instead. This slows rainwater

runoff, enabling microorganisms in the substrates to digest any water-borne pollutants, purifying

the water on its path back into the aquifer. Thanks to the biomimicry interventions, 90% of raw water

utilised by ESCAPE Penang’s play pools are harvested on-site.

















Low-Impact Development

During the development of ESCAPE Penang

Phase 1 (Adventureplay), leftover buildings -

what used to be workshops, pump houses,

worker

quarters,

and

storage

warehouses

during the Teluk Bahang Dam construction

period - were restored and repurposed into

staff

offices,

function

halls,

bathrooms,

cafeterias, and other facilities.

Sim Leisure Group used shipping containers as

substitutes

for

conventional

building

structures which assemble much quicker and

easier

while

emitting

less

pollution.

Their

standardised sizes provide endless possibilities

of configurations and interventions to suit

different

uses.

Moreover,

containers

can

relocate easily with minimal labour and energy,

playing into ESCAPE’s low-impact development

mantra.

Installing the World’s Longest Water Slide

In September 2019, Sim Leisure Group set a new Guinness World Record for the Longest Tube Water

Slide at 1,111 metres - shattering the previous record by three times.

This water slide starts at a 70-metre elevation from the hilltop of ESCAPE Penang’s Gravityplay,

taking riders downhill through Teluk Bahang’s rich forestry.

This water slide gives riders a unique perspective in viewing the rainforest. Water parks are typically

installed on flatlands, where the ride begins from the top of an erected tower, unlike ESCAPE

Penang’s water slide which starts at the hilltop.

The entire water slide is made of 488 pieces of

fibre-reinforced polymer slides and 326 side

guard components, connected by 10,248 sets of

bolts, nuts, washers, and spring washers as well

as 2,400 metres of steel pipes and arms.

No

throughout

the

entire

installation process which took 8 months. Sim

did

not

utilise

any

machinery for construction works because of

the terrain’s accessibility issues, as well as to

preserve the environment.

Instead, Sim Leisure Group performed most of

the

manually;

for

instance,

the

water slide components were lifted by erecting

scaffolds and using chain hoists.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2020

SIM LEISURE GROUP LTD.

Promoting Eco-Literacy

With sustainability at the core of the ESCAPE brand, it is imperative for Sim Leisure Group to

promote eco-literacy to its visitors and educate them.

People learn in moments of enjoyment. To communicate ESCAPE’s environmental initiatives and

thought-provoking ideas, these messages are printed on signages that are placed througout the

park for visitors to see as they play. These messages surround the visitors rather than being forced

on them.

Eco-literacy should start from a young age, where children learn best through play and immersive

experience. Sim Leisure Group encourages primary school field trips to ESCAPE Penang by selling

school group tickets at significantly lowered rates for affordability, especially among students of

lower-income households who might not otherwise have such opportunities.

An important aspect of promoting eco-literacy is instilling the desire among the people to cherish

the natural environment. This is where the immersive experience of playing in nature is vital to

ESCAPE’s visitors. The love for nature cannot be taught in classrooms or lectures; rather the visitor

absorbs these messages and draw their own conclusions through due thought and self

determination.

Sim Leisure Group does not wish to pressure visitors to become more environmentally aware and

sensitive. For children to wish to protect the environment, they must first fall in love with nature.
