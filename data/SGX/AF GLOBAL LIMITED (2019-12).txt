In AF Global Limited’s third Sustainability Report, we have presented an update on our sustainability efforts for the 

ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2019 (‘’FY2019”).

The Board had reviewed and determined that the material Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) issues 

identiﬁed remained relevant and signiﬁcant to our organisation and key stakeholders. In FY2019, the Board continued 

to oversee the management and monitoring of these ESG factors as part of its overall responsibility of directing and 

leading the organisation towards our mission of value creation and building a sustainable business.

BOARD STATEMENT


2.1  Report Scope

This report covers the sustainability performance of  

AF Global Limited and its subsidiaries (“Group”) for 

FY2019. The scope of this report will focus on the 

sustainability performance, activities and initiatives that 

are under our direct control, and excludes joint ventures 

which are not directly under our control. Material issues 

and topics described have been selected according to 

their level of signiﬁcance within the Group’s boundaries, 

the sustainability context and the stakeholders’ 

expectations, and for comparability of our performance 

indicators over time. In this respect, this report contains 

information for our core hospitality business in the 

material operational territory Phuket and excludes our 

operations in Ho Chi Minh City and Vientiane, as well as 

ad hoc projects. 

During the year, the Group had disposed of  

Crowne Plaza London Kensington, whose information 

was included in previous reports. In this report, we have 

restated the FY2017 and FY2018 ﬁgures in the relevant 

sections and have adjusted the FY2019 and 2030 targets 

based on the restated ﬁgures for base year 2017.

CORPORATE PROFILE


4. INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY INTO OUR BUSINESS

Corporate Social Responsibility is a key driver towards long-term sustainability which is pragmatically 

integrated into our business practices and our corporate culture.

Being in the hospitality business, we are in a privileged position to raise awareness on the importance of 

sustainability and allow our guests to participate in some of the sustainability initiatives during their stay 

with us in our hotel. We have engaged global professional hotel management companies reputed for their 

experience and approach toward sustainability so as to tap into their valuable knowledge to help us in 

implementing and integrating sustainability in our daily business practices and operational activities. We aim 

to create a culture of sustainability among our staff in every aspect of our hotel operations, a culture which 

allows us to imprint positive inﬂuence on our guests through their experience with us.

4.1  Sustainability Management Framework

In July 2017, we established our sustainability reporting 

framework. We performed an analysis on our business 

and operation models to establish the basis for our 

stakeholder mapping and materiality assessment. 

Through our analysis, we identiﬁed ﬁve key stakeholder 

groups within our sustainability context and their 

respective material issues are shown in this report.

4.2  Key Stakeholders and Material Issues

We have a review, assessment and feedback process in 

relation to ESG topics. The key to this is a risk assessment 

exercise which entails the identiﬁcation, assessment 

and documentation of material risks and corresponding 

internal controls. Such material risks include fraud and 

corruption, environmental, health and safety, and human 

capital risks. We review the adequacy and effectiveness 

of our risk assessment process in response to changing 

business and operation environment.

We also identify and review material issues that are 

most relevant and signiﬁcant to us and our stakeholders. 

Priority is given to issues important to society that is 

applicable to us. We then prioritise our sustainability 

efforts and report issues that are most material to our 

business and stakeholders.

We believe that good CSR practice goes hand-in-hand with good corporate management practice. We also 

recognise that it is vital that our management approaches are adaptable to the dynamics of business and 

operation environment across geographic boundaries in such a way that we can continuously assess our 

impacts, develop sustainability objectives and respond in a proper manner to meet expectations.

Communication and provision of appropriate feedback mechanisms which will allow us to monitor and 

evaluate performance as well as explore new possibilities is critical in sustainability reporting. This is 

managed through a CSR plan.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 


5.1  Protecting Our Environment for Future 

Generations

5.1.1 Our Approach

We continuously seek new and innovative ways to 

reduce the environmental impact of our products and 

services while maintaining the quality. We recognise our 

responsibility to protect the environment for the health 

and well-being of future generations. 

5.1.2 Reduction of Carbon Footprint

We recognise that the effective management and 

monitoring of carbon footprint can reduce operating 

costs, raise brand proﬁle, create a competitive edge 

and increase stakeholder value. Our carbon footprint is 

measured in terms of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission. 

However, GHG emission is an absolute measure of 

how much carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) is emitted. 

Our GHG emission is predominantly indirect (Scope 2) 

emission. We have direct (Scope 1) emissions and we 

do not include the GHG emissions generated by our 

suppliers (Scope 3).

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and 

operations, we established our GHG emission efﬁciency 

index for consistent tracking of carbon footprint over 

time. To this end, we have set a target for GHG emission 

efﬁciency improvement of 10% from our 2017 level by 

2030. 

In FY2019, our GHG emission efﬁciency index stands 

at 198,365.51 kgCO2e per SGD million, which is 13.7% 

higher than our base year 2017.  This is mainly due to hotel 

renovation works carried out during the year. Electricity 

consumption had remained stable but closed rooms 

resulted in lower revenue. We will continue to monitor 

our performance and work towards our 2030 goal.

5.1.3 Reduction of Paper Consumption

Our employees are urged to minimise paper wastage 

at work by adhering to our internal guidelines. For 

example, double-sided printing is set as a default, 

lower grammage paper is used for daily printing, and 

blank sides of unneeded single-sided copies are used 

for printing drafts. A green message to consider the 

environment before printing is always included in the 

email signatures of our employees. Paper re-use and 

recycling habits are also cultivated through initiatives 

such as our in-house reminders posted near the copy 

machines.

We have embarked on a digital document management 

system with an aim to improve operational efﬁciency, 

security and reduce paper consumption. We hope to 

eventually evolve into a paperless working environment.

Considering the changes and dynamics of business 

and operations, we established our paper consumption 

index for consistent tracking of paper consumption over 

time. To this end, we have set a target for a reduction in 

paper consumption of 10% from our 2017 level by 2030.

In FY2019, we consumed a total of 5,488.56 kg of 

paper, 100% of which are Forest Stewardship Council 

(FSC) certiﬁed. The paper consumption index stands at 

234.96 kg per SGD million which is 10.6% lower than 

last year. We have achieved an 8.8% improvement over 

our FY2019 target.  

However, the paper consumption index for FY2019 is 

5.3% higher than our base year 2017. We will continue 

to monitor our paper consumption and work towards 

our 2030 goal. 

5.1.4 Promoting Green Practices

Our hotel has been implementing green solutions 

suitable for its operating environment. Green solutions 

are initiatives that the hotel can implement to 

progressively improve its operation practices toward 

its sustainability goals. Each green solution lays out 

the steps that the hotel must take to implement the 

solution. Such initiatives are to be implemented through 

areas such as design, operational procedures and 

adaptation of green technologies to achieve objectives 

such as reducing energy, water and waste, cutting 

carbon emissions, improving guest health and comfort 

as well as reducing operating and maintenance costs. 

Examples of green solutions range from using  

energy-efﬁcient lighting and lighting controls, installing 

water-efﬁcient bathroom ﬁxtures to using energy 

efﬁcient appliances or any other alternative energy 

sourcing.

5.1.5 Hotel Sustainability Initiatives

Our hotel proactively track sustainability indicators as a

5.2  Caring for Our Employees

5.2.1 Our Approach

Our people are our valuable resource and investing in 

their professional development is vital to our business 

sustainability. Our goal is to establish work ethics 

among our employees, which are in line with our core 

values and code of conduct. 

We recognise that a motivated workforce will convey 

a positive message to all our key stakeholders. By 

attracting, nurturing, empowering and rewarding our 

employees, we create an environment conducive 

for innovation and inspiration which will boost our 

competitiveness.

Our business operates in an environment with diverse 

races, cultures and geographic locations. With this 

in mind, our Human Resource (HR) polices take into 

consideration the prevailing laws and regulations as well 

as local culture, norms and sensitivity.

5.2.2 Employment Practices

Our HR management principles and policies have been 

developed and established based on fair employment 

practices with the goal of attracting, developing and 

retaining a robust and motivated workforce. Our HR 

policies cover key areas such as remuneration, beneﬁts, 

and training. Our performance-based reward scheme 

provides guidance and motivation to our employees 

to perform to their potential in alignment with the 

objectives of the Group.

5.2.2.1 Communication

As we grow, effective and regular communication across 

the organisation is crucial to ensure continuous alignment 

of objectives between the employees and the organisation. 

We achieve this through our various communication 

sessions customised based on the target employees. 

Communication sessions for our managers are held on a 

regular basis. The agendas covered at these sessions are 

customised as appropriate to the target functional scope 

of the managers.

5.2.2.2 Employee Feedback

We value our employees’ expertise in their areas of 

responsibilities. Therefore, their feedback is important 

in the improvement of overall management and 

operations of the organisation. Through various 

established processes of employee engagement, such 

as employee objective setting, performance review as 

well as exit interviews in events of resignations, we 

gather valuable feedbacks for continuous improvements 

to the organisation.

In addition, there are other feedback channels for 

areas speciﬁc to business and function, such as the  

whistle-blowing policy on control and compliance 

issues. This policy allows staff to raise their concerns 

in conﬁdence about possible improprieties in matters 

of ﬁnancial reporting or other matters. We also accept 

anonymous reports to ensure that independent 

investigations of such matters are carried out and that 

appropriate follow-up action is taken.

5.2.2.3 Career Development and Training

We recognise that education and training is essential 

in maintaining a competitive workforce. Employee 

career development and performance management are 

established based on merit and contribution.

Training programmes cover a variety of areas catering for 

employees with different job scopes and skills requirements. 

The contents are guided by industry standards. In addition, 

speciﬁc training are provided based on the speciﬁc 

requirements of the businesses and functions. Training 

topics range from soft skills such as communication and 

hospitality to technical programmes covering safety and 

ofﬁce productivity tools.

non-managerial staff received an average of 23.4 hours 

and 12.1 hours of training respectively. We will continue to

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT | CARING FOR OUR EMPLOYEES


In addition to the human resources we manage, we 

also engage external contracted companies as our 

outsourced vendors to provide personnel, who might 

work within our premises. Although we supervise these 

individuals, they are employed by contracted companies 

and are not included in our head count. We do not 

employ other types of un-contracted workers.

We expect that the contracted companies we work 

with will share our core principles of HR management 

practices. In the event that this expectation is 

compromised, we will evaluate if we will continue to 

engage them.

5.2.4 Employee Beneﬁts

Employees are provided basic employment terms and 

working conditions including contract requirements, 

remuneration, hours of work, overtime, rest days 

and annual leave entitlement. In addition, we provide  

beyond-compliance-level 

beneﬁts 

to 

our 

full-time 

employees. 

5.2.4.1 Retirement and Healthcare

Our Group has presence overseas where there are 

local laws and regulations on pension and healthcare 

for employees. Our HR management practices comply 

with these applicable laws and regulations. 

5.2.5 Safety and Health in the Workplace

We are committed to workplace safety and health and 

take precautions to prevent occupational injuries among 

employees. We believe that safe work conditions will 

boost morale.

5.2.6 Individual Rights

Protecting basic human rights is fundamental to 

all our operations. Labour rights, the prohibition of 

discrimination and harassment, protection of privacy, 

prohibition of forced and child labour, and workplace 

health and safety are observed within the work 

environment. Discrimination and harassment are not 

tolerated.

We also respect our employees’ rights to freedom of 

association as well as their membership with trade 

unions and other professional bodies. 

In FY2019, no incidents of forced labour, child labour or 

young workers were identiﬁed across the organisation, 

and no human rights-related grievances have been 

reported.

5.3  Focusing on Our Customers’ Needs

5.3.1 Our Approach

Safety within our hotel premises have always been our 

key priority. 

Open and frequent communication and responsive 

feedback are ingrained into our daily activities with 

customer interaction. In addition to striving for 

excellence in our product, service and support, we 

attach importance to data privacy. We have processes 

and controls in place over conﬁdential and sensitive data 

related to our customers.

5.3.2 Health and Safety

Providing an accommodating atmosphere that does not 

compromise safety is the biggest challenge that hotels 

face. Achieving these goals require a multifaceted plan 

that starts with staff training and guest education about 

safety and security issues. Our hotel management 

consistently enforce established security policies, such 

as allowing only registered guests on hotel property. 

Constant planning to stay ahead of these issues is also 

a must, especially when the hotel hosts public events.

5.3.2.1 Access Control

Controlling access is an important part of hotel security 

planning to prevent criminal activities such as theft from 

guest rooms. Our contractors and staff are trained in 

controlling room key distribution and restricting access 

to registered guests only. Security personnel are 

stationed at all main access points to greet people, while 

deterring anyone with no business from entering the 

property, especially disruptive or intoxicated non-guests.

5.3.2.2 Guests Education

Hotel employees have a responsibility to educate guests on 

safety and security responsibilities. The challenge for staff 

is to get the message across without negatively affecting 

the customer’s experience. For instance, the bellman can 

gently remind guests the importance of locking room 

doors to prevent theft when delivering luggage to guests’ 

rooms. Front desk staff can also subtly discourage guests 

from actions that leave them vulnerable to crime, such 

as ﬂashing their room key cards with room numbers. Our 

staff are trained to manage such delicate situations in a 

professional manner to ensure the safety of our guests.

5.3.2.3 Public Areas Patrol

Technology has come a long way in helping hotels 

upgrade basic security measures. Closed-circuit TV 

cameras with recording systems are essential for 

securing such busy public spaces such as bars, lounges, 

parking lots, and loading bays. However, these areas 

also allow open access to disruptive persons, muggers 

and pickpockets. Monitoring of the camera images by 

staff and proper lighting reduces the chances for such 

crimes. 

5.3.2.4 Staff Training

Hotel guests can participate in relevant safety 

programmes carried out by the hotel.  Our hotel staff 

are trained with the objective of ensuring a consistent, 

professional response to emergencies. Our staff are 

empowered to take responsibility in addressing unusual 

behaviour that occurs on hotel property, without 

jeopardising their own safety.

5.3.3 Data Safety and Privacy

Ensuring safety and privacy of our customers’ data is 

our priority. We handle and communicate sensitive and 

conﬁdential information of our customers such as guest 

registration, home addresses and credit card information 

with due care to ensure our customers’ data are managed  

in accordance to the level of conﬁdentiality. We observe 

local laws and internal regulations applicable to personal 

information protection.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT | PARTNERING OUR SUPPLIERS

5.4  Partnering Our Suppliers

5.4.1 Our Approach

Our supply chain activities can be split into two broad 

categories: corporate supply chains and hotel supply 

chains. Our corporate supply chains cover procurement 

for our corporate ofﬁces. At the hotel level, supply chains 

cover procurement for items required for running a hotel 

and cover a wide range of items including food, linens, 

cleaning supplies and furniture. We believe that building 

strong relationships with our suppliers is essential in 

achieving sustainable business practices throughout 

our supply chains. We recognise that it is a continuously 

evolving process and hence, we have to be pragmatic 

in terms of communication and expectation of our key 

suppliers. 

5.4.2 Supplier Selection

Our key suppliers are selected through our supplier 

selection process. When selecting our key suppliers, 

we examine criteria such as ﬁnancial health, quality of 

products and services and competitiveness of pricing. 

Our ﬁnal decision on supplier selection will be based 

on the overall assessment which takes a balanced view 

across all selection criteria.

5.4.3 Supplier Review

We review the performance of our key suppliers to 

determine whether to extend our partnership with them. 

Such review process allows us to evaluate and ensure 

that our key suppliers’ services and products aligns to 

our business requirements and sustainability objectives.

5.5  Supporting Our Community

5.5.1 

Our Approach

We believe in giving back to the communities we 

conduct our business in. Over the years, we have been 

providing support to local schools, families with ﬁnancial 

difﬁculties and disaster relief efforts. To this end, our 

engagement programmes encompass ﬁnancial and 

practical support to carefully selected beneﬁciaries, such 

as fundraising and voluntary activities like donations of 

cash and necessities. 

These continuous out-reach efforts have fostered 

goodwill, improved relations and communication, 

and helped to nurture a stable and peaceful local 

environment. 

Our community initiatives are managed according 

to how closely they align with our own community 

engagement goals, the anticipated staff participation 

rate, and the tangible impact on the beneﬁciary. 

5.5.2 Our Community Initiatives Highlight

Blood Donation Drive

Holiday Inn Resort Phuket regularly supports the Phuket 

blood bank by providing its function room for the blood 

donation drive organised by a local hospital. Our staff 

and colleagues from nearby hotels participated and in 

2019, we have assisted in collecting 112 blood bags.

Charity Project for Ban Kalim School, Phuket

Holiday Inn Resort Phuket management and staff have 

supported local communities such as Ban Kalim School. 

We donated scholarships amounting to Baht 102,000 for 

students. Our staff improved the landscape, organised 

fun games and served lunch to the children.

Beach Cleanup Project

Holiday Inn Resort Phuket management and staff picked 

up litter along Patong Beach, doing their part in helping 

to save the environment.

6. PERFORMANCE TABLE

6.1  Energy Usage and CO2 Emissions

Direct and indirect CO2 emissions from fuel and electricity consumptions are measured in GHG emissions in 

kgCO2e while electricity consumption is measured in kilowatt hour (kWh). We purchased fuel and electricity from 

non-renewable sources.

Our business and function grow over time and the GHG emissions and electricity consumption patterns vary. To 

ensure consistency and comparability of the GHG emissions and electricity consumption measures over time, we 

create a GHG emission index and electricity consumption index for our performance monitoring. The index adjusts 

the GHG emissions and electricity consumption for the size of our activities. We normalise the amount of GHG 

emissions and electricity consumption by the amount of our revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our 

activities. The GHG emission index is measured in kgCO2e per SGD million and the electricity consumption index is 

measured in kWh per SGD million.

Performance

The GHG emission index and electricity consumption index are 13.7% and 13.3% higher 

than our base year 2017 and is behind our year-to-year expectation of 1.0% improvement.

This is mainly due to hotel renovation works carried out during the year. Electricity 

consumption had remained stable but the closed rooms resulted in lower revenue. 

We will continue to monitor our performance and work towards our 2030 goals of 10% 

improvement from 2017 level.

6.2  Paper Consumption

We capture the data for paper consumption by the number of reams used, where one ream is equivalent to 

500 sheets of paper. To ensure consistency and comparability across various paper sizes, such as A3 and A4 papers, 

we measure paper consumption by the weight of paper used which is adjusted for the various sizes and quality of 

papers.

Our business and function grow over time and the paper consumption patterns vary. We devise a paper consumption 

index for our performance monitoring. The index adjusts the paper consumption for the size of our activities. We 

normalise the weight of paper consumed by the amount of our revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our 

activities. The paper consumption index is measured in kilograms per SGD million.
