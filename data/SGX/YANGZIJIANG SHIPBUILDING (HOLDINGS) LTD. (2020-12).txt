CEO Message 

During the writing of the 2019 Sustainability Report, the COVID-19 pandemic had just begun to spread around the 

world and on hindsight, no one would have been able to predict the vast impact that the pandemic has left on the 

global economy. Apart from presenting the vulnerabilities of a tightly linked global economy, the pandemic is also 

a stark reminder of how various dimensions of sustainable development are inextricably linked and the need to 

accelerate progress towards sustainability goals.

As one of the top shipbuilding groups in the world, we are keenly aware that the Group’s stakeholders could be 

directly or indirectly influenced by our business operations, decisions and outcomes. Yangzijiang is committed 

to continuously integrate and improve sustainability practices across our business operations, and considers 

sustainability issues as part of our long-term strategy formulation. Ultimately, our success is interwoven with the 

successes of all our stakeholders. 

Yangzijiang has an important role to play towards sustainable development and I am glad that despite the 

uncertainties presented in 2020, Yangzijiang has made several strides towards our commitment. I believe that 

these progresses will ultimately come full circle to create a better future for the society, the environment and our 

business. On top of our continuous effort to drive sustainability, the Group will also continue to focus on maintaining 

a safe working environment for our employees and maintain good corporate governance practices. 

While I remain proud of the significant progress that Yangzijiang has made on our journey towards sustainability, 

we recognize that this is simply a step in the right direction. We remain committed to drive performance across 

the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors that we have determined to be material to the Group and 

will continue to partner with other stakeholders to drive fundamental change. 

In September 2020, China indicated its plans “to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon 

neutrality before 2060” at a virtual meeting of the UN General Assembly. In the same timeframe, Japan and South 

Korea formalized its zero-carbon agenda for 2050, similar to the mandate by the EU parliament. As one of the top 

global shipbuilders, Yangzijiang aligns its standards to global standards and prioritizes the design of and building 

of relevant vessels with higher energy efficiency. 

The shift towards sustainability is irreversible and we are excited to be part of this positive change.

Economic Contribution 







07

One of the largest corporate tax contributors to the local government 

The Group is one of the 50 largest enterprises in Jiangsu, the most developed and densely populated province 

in China. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused major uncertainties for the shipping industry, weighing on 

shipowners’ sentiments and leading to a depressed shipbuilding market. Despite the 29% decline of global volume 

of new building orders in 2020 in dead-weight-ton (“DWT”) terms, the Group secured new orders for 54 vessels 

worth USD 1.8 billion in 2020 (2019: 21 vessels worth USD 830 million). Its outstanding order book has consistently 

ranked among the top 10 in the world. 

For FY2020, the Group paid income taxes of RMB 672.0 million to the Wuxi municipal government. Wuxi has a 

population of about 6.5 million people. The Group ranked No.11 in its top-100 corporate tax contributor list for 

FY2020 (FY2019: Ranked No.13).

Economic Contributions to Society 

The Group employs 6,504 employees as at the end of 2020. Employees who are employed in the PRC participate 

in a defined contribution plan administered by the relevant provincial government. For FY2020, the Group was 

required to and continues to make monthly defined contribution to these plans at approximately 45% to 47% of 

eligible employees’ monthly salaries and wages as stipulated by local rules and regulations. 

Tax Benefits for High/New Technology 

Two major yards of the Group, Jiangsu New Yangzi Shipbuilding Co., Ltd (“JNYS”), and Jiangsu Yangzi Xinfu 

Shipbuilding Co., Ltd (“JXF”), enjoy the status of High-and-New Technology Enterprise granted by the government. 

The status is granted based on the Group’s consistent effort in enhancing its R&amp;D capabilities and gives the yards 

preferential tax rates of 15% instead of the standard tax rate of 25%. The status was granted initially in November 

2016 for three years. In 2019, the two yards successfully obtained an extension of the status for the reduced 

income tax rate of 15% for another 3 years, till November 2022.

The national High-and-New Technology Enterprises status is jointly awarded by the Ministry of Science and 

Technology, Ministry of Finance, and the State Administration of Taxation. Eligibility criteria include R&amp;D capability, 

track record in the development of intellectual property rights, use of technological innovations and improvements, 

and the proportion of R&amp;D personnel in the organization.

Economic Contribution 







07

In January 2020, YAMIC delivered two 82,000DWT bulk carriers, its first batch of ships built and delivered after 

the yard adopted a semi-submerged ship launching method.

In 2019, the Group introduced the semi-submerged ship launching method which is more commonly used in 

relatively advanced Korean yards, and is a result of the joint teamwork with its partners from Mitsui. 

This method uses a floating dock rather than a slipway or dry dock used in the traditional way of launching vessels. 

It removes the limitations of dock capacity and improves construction efficiency. It is also a cost-efficient way to 

increase capacity quickly. The 16,000DWT floating dock that was used in the semi-submerged launch was also 

designed and built by Yangzijiang.

The success of Yangzijiang as one of the best shipbuilding enterprises is the result of the collective commitment 

and passion of our employees over the years. We recognise that attracting and retaining talents is pertinent to 

building a thriving organisation. We invest in our employees to ensure that they have opportunities to develop in 

their personal and professional spaces, and are equipped with relevant skillsets required for them to excel in their 

roles. In 2020, average training hours for our employees were 32 hours. 

We strive to ensure a safe working environment for all our employees and workers. During the pandemic outbreak, 

the Group has also taken necessary steps to protect the safety of all our staff. Please see the section Workplace 

Safety for more details. The Group also conducts frequent training and drills to ensure workplace safety. The 

ultimate goal of the Group is to have zero injuries and fatalities at its shipyards.

on the Group level and receives feedback from the ground. All our employees are employed permanently on a 

full-time basis and they are covered by agreements in line with fair practices. Employees can also take part in 

extra-curricular activities such as community service activities and sports and recreation activities organised by 

the Group.

Building internal strengths

The Group’s management steers the growth of Yangzijiang and has made tremendous contribution to the Group 

over the years. The Group aims to retain its key employees through a comprehensive employee compensation 

scheme and structure. In April 2019, the Group’s Honorary Chairman (then Executive Chairman) donated 150 

million shares of his personal shareholdings in Yangzijiang and set up a trust to reward the senior management 

of the Group and those who have made significant contributions to Yangzijiang’s business. This also allows for 

the alignment of interests between the Group’s senior management and its shareholders. 

Over the past few years, the Group has hired over 100 senior technology management experts, of whom 2 are 

recipients of State grants for technology development, 9 are senior research fellows, 29 are senior engineers and 

386 are engineers. As at the end of 2020, the Group had 710 technical staffs. Of these people, 475 staffs were 

based in the Group’s new Yangzi yard, 42 staffs were based in Xinfu yard, 62 staffs in YAMIC and 131 staffs were 

based in Shanghai. 

The Group strives to enhance its R&amp;D capabilities and places a strategic focus on strengthening the educational 

profile of its employees. R&amp;D headcount accounted for 17% of Yangzijiang’s total staff strength as at the end of 

2020.

Yangzijiang organises a groupwide technical skills competition annually, held over two days. Fitters and electricians 

from the Group’s major shipyards formed teams and took part in this competition. Through this platform, employees 

are able to showcase their technical skills and learn from their counterparts. A total of 102 staff took part in this 

competition in 2020.

Tapping on the strengths of our joint venture partners

Termed “Project Chiba”, a team of 17 representatives from 

Yangzijiang participated in an on-site training in Japan 

at joint venture partner Mitsui’s yard in January 2020 on 

design, safety management, quality control, automation, 

and production planning. 

This on-site training was first-of-its-kind, and had received 

positive reviews from participants of the program. Despite 

plans to send more representatives for similar trainings, the 

Group had to put these plans on hold due to the pandemic 

and travel restrictions. Yangzijiang expects to resume this 

training programme when it is feasible and appropriate.

Digital transformation

The implementation of digital transformation for Yangzijiang is a firm-wide process that has been ongoing for years. 

Ultimately, it will allow for an end-to-end process integration including design, planning, procurement, production, 

quality, cost and capital control across its major yards and other companies. This is also a strategic decision to 

improve the Group’s shipbuilding efficiency. The Group will provide training programs for our employees to ensure 

that they are on board the Group’s push for digital transformation.

Risk Management 

Managing Operational Risk

The Group’s shipbuilding customer base is well diversified geographically, with sales contributions from Asia, 

Australia, Europe, and Canada. Its customer base consists of some of the most prominent shipowners in the 

world, and many of them have been Yangzijiang’s customers for decades.

In the shipbuilding business, a company should primarily focus on the prevention of the following operational 

risks, and under each item, we will discuss how the risk is managed at Yangzijiang.

1. Termination of contract by customers

• 

Shipbuilding contract terms and conditions are prudently negotiated to prevent customers from terminating 

contracts unjustifiably

• 

The Group proactively liaises with ship owners to understand the charter demand outlook and customers’ 

needs to pre-empt and work out solutions to lower the risk of contract termination

• 

Agree to renegotiate on delivery schedule and rework of vessel types when the market condition is extremely 

challenging

• 

Ultimately, if the customer decides to terminate the contract, the deposit that was placed with the Group will 

be forfeited by Yangzijiang 

2.  Customer is unable to obtain bank financing or guarantee for the contract

• 

The Group provides assistance to customers where needed and feasible

3. Delay in construction schedule

• 

Technology-powered, seamless workflow to ensure that the production is on schedule

• 

Enhance the integrity of the product in each module/section through all-year-round, systematic training to 

remove the need to rework

• 

Proactive communication with customers in uncontrollable situations such as the shipyards’ shut down for a 

few weeks due to COVID-19 in February to March 2020, to ensure on-time delivery. All vessels were delivered 

on schedule eventually despite a shutdown in operations at our shipyards

4. Disruption in the supply of raw materials and equipment

• 

Using an established supplier qualifying system to manage a pool of qualified suppliers and reserve suppliers 

for each category of supplies

• 

Regular review and feedback to suppliers on their product and service

• 

Regular review of the supplier system to ensure the best cost for value and quality

5. Cost overrun

• 

Strict accountability to the head of the production unit on the control of production time and unit cost

• 

Encourage all employees to contribute cost-saving ideas in every aspect of the production, provided that quality 

standard is not compromised. Often cost-saving ideas lead to a win-win situation for both the Group and the 

customer

6. Dispute on specification

• 

Determine all the specification to the finest detail in the negotiation stage to prevent such dispute

• 

Close communication with the customer during the construction process, seeking a feasible solution to problems 

encountered

• 

All communication and meeting records are well documented

Managing Financial Risk

The Group adopts a prudent and arguably, conservative approach in its financial management and accounting 

policies. It takes a conservative view in its budgeting in operations and makes provisions to reflect market 

conditions as and when required.

Shipbuilding business

• 

The Group considers the expected adverse movement in the price of raw materials and the USD/RMB exchange 

rate, among other factors, between the time when a contract is signed and the time of vessel delivery, and 

makes provisions during the construction process accordingly. The provision is reviewed and adjusted regularly 

during the construction process

• 

The Group also makes provisions on warranties for vessels delivered as a standard practice. These provisions 

will be reversed when the Group is no longer liable for the warranty coverage

• 

As majority of shipbuilding contracts are denominated in USD, the Group looks to hedge its exposure to future 

USD-denominated income through derivatives and has entered into USD/RMB forward contracts. In 2020, the 

Group also entered into USD/SGD cross currency swap to mitigate its borrowing costs of its one-year loan 

denominated in SGD

Investment business

• 

According to its investment guidelines, the business only invests in projects with limited risk while giving 

the Group a higher level of fixed return than bank deposits to supplement the Group’s principal shipbuilding 

business, which is cyclical in nature

• 

It’s the Group’s policy to cap the loan-to-value ratio at a strict level (50% or below), backed by accepted collaterals 

such as publicly-traded shares, land, government guarantee (backed by government tax revenues) and other 

guarantee backed by various types of assets

• 

The investment committee conducts thorough due diligence and the projects need to be approved by the voting 

of the investment committee

• 

The interest payment is closely monitored and actions are taken immediately as soon as any late payment is 

identified

• 

The investment portfolio is reviewed at least once every quarter

• 

Even as these investments are backed up by collaterals, the Group makes provisions according to the risk 

characteristics of each project. The investment portfolio recorded on the Group’s balance sheet is net of 

provisions

The management has been exploring feasible proposals regarding the Group’s debt portfolio and these include 

placing a limit on the size of the portfolio in order to improve the Group’s return on capital. The management is also 

looking towards further increasing information disclosure on our debt portfolio to ensure greater transparency.

The Group has managed to maintain a strong financial position over the years through prudent management of 

financial risk and similarly, this anchors how we manage our debt portfolio.

Irrevocable shift towards cleaner vessels 

The global shipping industry accounts for about 90% of world trade and emits more than 1 billion ton of greenhouse 

gas (‘GHG’), or accounts for over 2% of global CO2 emissions every year. As carbon emissions remain high and 

with greenhouse gases at its highest levels, stakes for the planet are high. 

In order to combat climate change and its impacts, the UN shipping agency, the International Maritime Organization 

(IMO) rolled out its aim to reduce the industry’s total greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2050, compared to 

levels in 2008. IMO has adopted mandatory measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from international 

shipping, under IMO’s pollution prevention treaty (MARPOL) - the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) mandatory 

for new ships, and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP).

Since 1 January 2020, the IMO 2020 came into effect, limiting sulfur content from 3.5% to 0.50% m/m (mass 

by mass) in the fuel oil used on ships operating outside designated emission control areas. Other “alternatives” 

to meet the IMO requirements include installing exhaust gas cleaning systems, also known as “scrubbers”, or 

equipped for alternative fuels such as LNG. In 2020, among more than 60,000 trading ships, only 55 cases had 

trouble obtaining 0.50% compliant fuel, according to IMO’s Global Integrated Shipping System (GISIS). 

Vessels built between 2021 to 2025 will also have to be in compliance with EEDI phase 2 – ships need to have a 

20% reduction in carbon intensity compared to 2008. The 2030 ambition (EEDI phase 3) is for vessels to have a 

40% reduction in carbon intensity compared to 2008. 

Any failure to comply with the global regulation could result in fines and vessels being impounded. As such, the 

demand for LNG vessels is expected to surge as shipowners move towards placing orders for vessels that are 

more efficient and in compliance with IMO requirements.

The march towards carbon neutrality 

In September 2020, Chinese President Xi Jinping mentioned China’s plans “to have CO2 emissions peak before 

2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060” at a virtual meeting of the UN General Assembly. In the same 

timeframe, Japan and South Korea formalized its zero-carbon agenda for 2050, similar to the mandate by the 

EU parliament. As one of the top global shipbuilders, Yangzijiang aligns its standards to global standards and 

prioritizes the design and building of relevant vessels with higher energy efficiency. 

Building Capabilities in Clean Energy Vessels

Yangzijiang looks towards the building of LNG vessels as its next phase of growth. This focus also represents 

the Group’s commitment to combat climate change. While Yangzijiang has expertise in and has developed LNG 

vessels, the Group believes that it can further strengthen its capabilities in this area through partnerships. In order 

to strengthen capabilities across the LNG supply chain, the Group will seek both vertical and horizontal integration 

in LNG-related sectors. 

Yangzi-Mitsui Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (“YAMIC”), the Group’s joint venture with Mitsui E&amp;S Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (“MES-

SC”) and Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. (together with MES-SC, “Mitsui”) of Japan, represents part of Yangzijiang’s strategy to 

develop the techniques and capabilities to build LNG-related vessels and play its part to reduce carbon emissions. 

In 2021, Yangzijiang also formed a company, Jiangsu Run Yuan Energy Co., Ltd. (“JREC”) with our venture partners 

Wuxi China Resources Gas Co., Ltd and Jiangyin Xinyangchuan Enterprise Management Center, which will operate 

in the gas utilities and energy space respectively. The main business activities of JREC will be the construction of 

LNG storage facilities, natural gas trading and businesses related to parts of the LNG supply chain. Through this 

joint investment, Yangzijiang will gain initial exposure to a broader range of LNG-related business and develop 

relevant expertise which will allow us to capture the long-term growth potential in this market segment.

  Sustainability Report 2020

25










In line with global environmental standards and regulations, Yangzijiang’s continuous R&amp;D and investment in 

efficient vessels has led to it delivering vessels (including large vessels) meeting various regulations. 

In April 2021, Yangzijiang delivered the tenth and the last unit of 208,000DWT bulk carrier built for CDB Leasing, 

named CL BAISE. CL BAISE is the largest dry bulker in the second generation of Newcastlemax Dry Bulk Carriers, 

with a total length of 294.4m, width of 50m and a cruising speed of 14.5 knots per hour. The main engine emission 

of this vessel fulfills the requirement of EEDI phase II and Tier III NOx emission standards as well as allowing for 

better route adaptability. 

Backed by the accumulation of experience over the years, Yangzijiang’s new generation ships are more energy 

efficient, with lighter structural steel weight, better navigation against wind resistance and wave drag control 

amongst others, optimizing vessel performance and can provide shipowners with customized solutions to ensure 

environmental protection. 

Yangzijiang will continue investing in and improving its vessel capabilities in order to bring to the market, vessels 

with greater energy efficiency and create a ripple effect in reducing its carbon footprint.

R&amp;D Breakthrough to Lower Paint VOCS

The Group participates in research initiatives led by global leaders to eliminate hazards in the industry. In recent 

years, its effort to reduce workplace exposure to volatile organic compounds have borne fruit. 

For example, paints are anti-corrosion agents in shipbuilding. Surface preparation, paint, and other protective 

coatings used in shipbuilding and ship repair pose a hazard to workers. Potentially harmful substances can enter 

the body through inhalation, ingestion, and contact with the eyes or skin. The Three-Year Action Plan for Winning 

the Blue Sky Defence War released by the PRC State Council in July 2018 creates an action plan to reduce 2015 

VOC emissions by 10% by 2020. The Chinese government has tightened the environmental regulations and adopted 

the “2020 Action Plan for the Control of VOCs”, a series of stricter standards and regulations put in place, with 

greater efforts placed on controlling harmful or toxic VOCs.

The Group has a long-lasting relationship with Jotun Coatings (“Jotun”), the marine anti-fouling coating arm of 

a leading chemicals company based in Norway. In 2017, Yangzi Xinfu Yard’s joint R&amp;D findings with Jotun to 

reduce emissions from volatile organic compounds (“VOC”) found in paints was published in the leading PRC 

academic journal, China Paint. It has applied this new coating method to the construction of its VLOC vessels. 

The breakthrough was so significant that the new method has gradually been adopted as an industry protocol.

In summary, this finding has the following contribution to the industry:

• 

Significantly decrease the production cycle time in coating work, thereby decreasing worker exposure to VOC

• 

Significantly decrease the VOC emission level in paints used at Yangzijiang

• 

Reduce the use of raw materials

• 

Protect the environment

• 

Reduce the Group’s emission of pollutants

• 

Reduce the cost of handling hazardous waste

Water Usage

Water is an important and scarce resource, especially in China where water pollution has affected 90% of the 

groundwater in our cities, contaminated by the dumping of toxic human and industrial waste. 

The Group has the following procedures to protect its natural water resources:

• 

Responsible disposal of hazardous waste

• 

Conservation of water used for drinking and in toilets

• 

Conscious effort to reduce water consumption

Energy Consumption 

 

The Group has a comprehensive appraisal system on equipment maintenance and energy saving. Every production 

worker is held responsible for the proper upkeep of the equipment that he handles. Punitive action is also taken 

against the line manager, district manager and equipment manager if rules are breached. Whenever possible, 

Yangzijiang makes use of renewable energy such as natural gas and solar power as well as renewable materials. 

In November 2019, the Group’s power storage station begun operations. Utilizing lithium batteries, the station 

releases the power in its storage during peak hours to support construction and help the company rationalize its cost 

on electricity. The power storage station is expected to save close to RMB 1 million in electricity costs every year.

Yangzijiang put continued efforts in improving workplace safety in 2020, and here are some highlights of such 

actions at various divisions:

• 

Annual complimentary health check-up for employees

• 

Emergency drills and machinery/equipment inspection at all relevant divisions throughout the year, especially 

ahead of rainy season and summer heat

• 

Thorough monthly inspection at each division to identify safety hazards

• 

The Group has set up one clinic at each of its major yards (3 in total) to ensure that all employees can have 

immediate access to medical care whenever necessary 

The safety of our employees remains the top priority of the Group and we aim to have zero accidents at our yards. 

Heatstroke Prevention

The Group has a comprehensive heatstroke prevention program every summer to minimize accidents. The program 

includes:

• 

Clear assignment of accountability on each risk item

• 

Constant monitoring of temperature and flexible working schedules

• 

An emergency plan that is reviewed and refined regularly, which also specifies the reporting mechanism

• 

Frequent and regular talks and review on safety production in morning and weekly meetings

• 

Provide sufficient hydration drinks and cooling medical supplements for workers

• 

Requirement that at least two workers are working together (in each other’s sight) at all times, counting staff 

every day after work, closely monitor the physical state of workers (no workers who are in inadequate working 

state are allowed on the production premises), requires all workers to have 10-15 minutes break for every one 

hour of work, etc

In addition, cooling buckets and towels are placed in the engine rooms for workers to use.

Dust Removal

To decrease debris from greater construction volumes and more cutting machinery at its production premises, 

the Group made investments to purchase more dust removal equipment. Visibility at the production workshop 

premises improved significantly and the processed emissions met the regulatory requirement once the dust 

removal system was in use.
