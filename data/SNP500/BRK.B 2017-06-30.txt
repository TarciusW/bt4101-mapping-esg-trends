BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. 
and Subsidiaries  NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  June 30, 2017 
Note 1. General  The
accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds
controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes the terms “us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently
issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”) which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant
accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. At December 31, 2016, we began presenting U.S. Treasury Bills with maturity dates greater than three months from
their purchase dates separately in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accordingly, we revised the comparative 2016 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows to reflect this change. 
Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that
are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For a number of reasons, our results for interim
periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid
losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Variations in the amount and timing of investment gains/losses can cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. In
addition, changes in the fair values of liabilities associated with derivative contracts and gains and losses associated with the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies can cause significant
variations in periodic net earnings.  Note 2. New accounting pronouncements 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU
2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” ASU 2014-09 applies to contracts with customers, excluding, most notably, insurance and leasing contracts. The
framework prescribed by ASU 2014-09 includes (a) identifying the contract, (b) identifying the related performance obligations, (c) determining the transaction price, (d) allocating the
transaction price to the identified performance obligations and (e) recognizing revenues as the identified performance obligations are satisfied. Based on our evaluations to-date, we do not currently
believe the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, timing of the recognition of revenue and related costs may change with respect to certain of
our contracts with customers. For instance, revenues and costs for certain contracts may be recognized over time rather than when the product or service is delivered, as is the current practice. In addition, certain contracts may be treated as
leases for accounting purposes, rather than contracts with customers subject to ASU 2014-09. Our evaluations of these and other issues and implementation efforts concerning ASU
2014-09 are ongoing and also include consideration of the new disclosure requirements. We will adopt ASU 2014-09 as of January 1, 2018, under the modified
retrospective method.  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 “Financial
Instruments—Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” ASU 2016-01 generally requires that equity securities (excluding equity method investments) be measured at fair
value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Under existing GAAP, changes in fair value of available-for-sale equity investments are recorded in other
comprehensive income. Given the current magnitude of our investments in equity securities, the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have a significant impact on the periodic net earnings reported in our Consolidated
Statement of Earnings, although it will not significantly affect our comprehensive income or total shareholders’ equity. We will adopt ASU 2016-01 as of January 1, 2018. As of that date, the
accumulated unrealized appreciation relating to our investments in equity securities, which is currently included in accumulated other comprehensive income, will be reclassified to retained earnings. 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 “Leases.” ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use
asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. ASU 2016-02 is effective for reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 “Financial Instruments—Credit
Losses,” which provides for the recognition and measurement at the reporting date of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost and
available-for-sale debt securities. Currently, credit losses are recognized and measured when such losses become probable based on the prevailing facts and
circumstances. ASU 2016-13 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note 2. New accounting pronouncements (Continued) 
 
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU
2017-04 “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” ASU 2017-04 eliminates the requirement to determine the implied value of goodwill in measuring an
impairment loss. Upon adoption, the measurement of a goodwill impairment will represent the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over fair value, limited to the carrying value of goodwill. ASU
2017-04 is effective for goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. 
Note 3. Significant business acquisitions 
Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses at sensible prices that have consistent earning power, good
returns on equity and able and honest management. Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates. 
On January 29, 2016, Berkshire acquired all outstanding common stock of Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”) for
$235 per share in cash pursuant to a merger agreement dated August 8, 2015. The aggregate consideration paid was approximately $32.7 billion, which included the value of PCC shares we already owned. We funded the acquisition with a
combination of existing cash balances and proceeds from a short-term credit facility. PCC is a worldwide, diversified manufacturer of complex metal components and products. It serves the aerospace, power and general industrial markets. PCC is a
market leader in manufacturing complex structural investment castings and forged components for aerospace markets, machined airframe components and highly engineered critical fasteners for aerospace applications, and in manufacturing airfoil
castings for the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets. PCC also is a leading producer of titanium and nickel superalloy melted and mill products for the aerospace, chemical processing, oil and gas and pollution control industries, and
manufactures extruded seamless pipe, fittings and forgings for power generation and oil and gas applications.  On
February 29, 2016, we acquired the Duracell business from The Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”) pursuant to an agreement entered into in November 2014. Pursuant to the agreement, we received a recapitalized Duracell
Company in exchange for shares of P&G common stock held by Berkshire subsidiaries, which had a fair value of approximately $4.2 billion. Duracell is a leading manufacturer of high-performance alkaline batteries and is an innovator in
wireless charging technologies.  Pro forma consolidated revenues and net earnings data for 2016 was not materially
different from the amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill from these acquisitions is not amortizable for income tax purposes. The fair values of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed and
residual goodwill of PCC and Duracell at their respective acquisition dates are summarized as follows (in millions).

Note 6. Investments in The Kraft Heinz Company 
In June 2013, Berkshire invested $12.25 billion in a newly-formed company, H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (“Heinz
Holding”), consisting of 425 million shares of common stock, warrants to acquire approximately 46 million additional shares of common stock at $0.01 per share and cumulative compounding preferred stock (“Preferred Stock”)
with a liquidation preference of $8 billion. An affiliate of the global investment firm 3G Capital (such affiliate, “3G”) also acquired 425 million shares of Heinz Holding common stock for $4.25 billion. At that time,
Berkshire and 3G each owned a 50% share of Heinz Holding common stock. Heinz Holding then acquired H.J. Heinz Company.

Note 6. Investments in The Kraft Heinz Company (Continued)
  
In March 2015, Heinz Holding entered into an agreement to acquire all of the
outstanding common stock of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (“Kraft”). In June 2015, Berkshire exercised the aforementioned common stock warrants. On July 1, 2015, Berkshire and 3G also acquired new shares of Heinz Holding common stock for
$5.26 billion and $4.74 billion, respectively. After these transactions, Berkshire owned approximately 52.5% of the outstanding shares of Heinz Holding. On July 2, 2015, Heinz Holding completed its acquisition of Kraft, at which time
Heinz Holding was renamed The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). In connection with its acquisition of Kraft, Kraft Heinz issued one new share of Kraft Heinz common stock for each share of Kraft common stock, which reduced
Berkshire’s and 3G’s ownership interests in Kraft Heinz to 26.8% and 24.2%, respectively.  Berkshire currently
owns 26.7% of the outstanding shares of Kraft Heinz common stock. We account for our investment in Kraft Heinz common stock pursuant to the equity method. The carrying value of this investment was approximately $15.6 billion at June 30,
2017 and $15.3 billion at December 31, 2016. Our earnings determined under the equity method for the first six months were $548 million in 2017 and $446 million in 2016. We received dividends on the common stock of
$391 million in the first six months of 2017 and $374 million in the first six months of 2016, which we recorded as reductions of our investment. In the second quarter of 2016, we also received dividends of $180 million on our
Preferred Stock investment, which Kraft Heinz redeemed for cash of $8.32 billion on June 7, 2016.  Kraft Heinz is
one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee, and other grocery products. Summarized consolidated financial
information of Kraft Heinz follows (in millions).

 We currently own 50,000 shares of 6% Non-Cumulative
Perpetual Preferred Stock of BAC (“BAC Preferred”) with a liquidation value of $100,000 per share and warrants to purchase 700,000,000 shares of common stock of BAC (“BAC Warrants”). The BAC Preferred is redeemable at the option
of BAC beginning on May 7, 2019 at a redemption price of $105,000 per share (or $5.25 billion in aggregate). The BAC Warrants expire in 2021 and are exercisable for an aggregate cost of $5 billion ($7.142857/share). On June 28,
2017, BAC’s Board of Directors announced plans to increase the quarterly dividend on BAC’s common stock to $0.12 per share, beginning in the third quarter of 2017. On June 30, 2017, we announced our intention to exercise all of the
BAC Warrants we currently own when the BAC quarterly dividend increase occurs. We currently expect to use substantially all of our BAC Preferred as consideration for the $5 billion cost to exercise the BAC Warrants. 
We currently own Class A 9% Cumulative Compounding Perpetual Preferred Shares of RBI (“RBI Preferred”) having a
stated value of $3 billion. RBI, domiciled in Canada, franchises and operates quick service restaurants. The RBI Preferred is entitled to dividends on a cumulative basis of 9% per annum plus an additional amount, if necessary, to produce
an after-tax yield to Berkshire as if the dividends were paid by a U.S.-based company. The RBI Preferred is redeemable at the option of RBI beginning on December 12, 2017. In the second quarter of 2017,
RBI announced its intention to redeem all or a portion of our RBI Preferred investment. If not redeemed prior to December 12, 2024, we can cause RBI to redeem the RBI Preferred. In either case, the redemption price will be 109.9% of the stated
value of such shares.

Note 8. Income taxes 
Our consolidated effective income tax rates for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 were 28.9% and 28.1%,
respectively, and 31.1% and 22.3%, respectively, in the second quarter and first six months of 2016. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from: (a) dividends received deductions applicable to certain investments in
equity securities, (b) income production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. and (c) lower income tax rates applicable to earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. 
On February 29, 2016, we exchanged our long-held investment in P&G common stock for the common stock of Duracell. This
exchange produced a pre-tax gain of $1.1 billion for financial reporting purposes. The exchange transaction was structured as a tax-free reorganization under the
Internal Revenue Code. As a result, no income taxes were payable on the excess of the fair value of the business received over the tax basis of the P&G shares exchanged, and we recorded a one-time
reduction of certain deferred income tax liabilities (approximately $750 million) that were recorded in 2005 in connection with our exchange of The Gillette Company common stock for P&G common stock upon the merger of those two companies. The
P&G/Duracell exchange produced an 8.3 percentage point reduction in our consolidated effective income tax rate for the first six months of 2016.

2016 also included approximately $1.1 billion from the exchange of our P&G common stock in connection with the acquisition of Duracell.  Note

 Loans and finance receivables are primarily installment loans originated or acquired by our
manufactured housing business. In June 2017, we agreed to provide a Canada-based financial institution with a C$2 billion (approximately $1.5 billion) one-year secured revolving credit facility. The agreement expires on June 29, 2018. The
outstanding loan balance of C$1.4 billion at June 30, 2017 was repaid during July. Provisions for loan losses in both the first six months of 2017 and 2016 were $78 million. Loan charge-offs, net of recoveries, in the first six months
were $83 million in 2017 and $78 million in 2016. At June 30, 2017, we evaluated approximately 98% of the manufactured housing loan balances collectively for impairment. As a part of the evaluation process, credit quality indicators
are reviewed and loans are designated as performing or non-performing. At June 30, 2017, we considered approximately 99% of the loan balances to be performing and approximately 95% of the loan balances
current as to payment status.  Note 12. Property, plant and equipment and assets held for lease

Note 14. Derivative contracts 
 We are party to derivative contracts primarily through our finance and financial products and our utilities and energy
businesses. Currently, the derivative contracts of our finance and financial products businesses include equity index put option contracts written between 2004 and 2008. The liabilities and related notional values of such contracts follows (in
millions).

contract’s expiration date. Certain of these contracts are denominated in foreign currencies. Notional amounts are based on the foreign currency exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. 
We record derivative contract liabilities at fair value and include the changes in the fair values of such contracts in
earnings as derivative gains/losses. We entered into these contracts with the expectation that the premiums received would exceed the amounts ultimately paid to counterparties. A summary of the derivative gains/losses included in our Consolidated
Statements of Earnings follows (in millions).

 The equity index put option contracts are European style options written on four major equity
indexes and expire between June 2018 and January 2026. Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be required if the prevailing index value is below the contract strike price at the expiration date. We received aggregate premiums of
$4.2 billion on these contracts at the contract inception dates and therefore we have no counterparty credit risk. The aggregate intrinsic value (the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled based on the index values and
foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date) was $842 million at June 30, 2017 and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2016. However, these contracts may not be unilaterally terminated or fully settled before the
expiration dates. Therefore, the ultimate amount of cash basis gains or losses on these contracts will not be determined for several years. The remaining weighted average life of all contracts was approximately 3.4 years at June 30, 2017. 
A limited number of our equity index put option contracts contain collateral posting requirements with respect to changes in
the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts and/or a downgrade of Berkshire’s credit ratings. As of June 30, 2017, we did not have any collateral posting requirements. If Berkshire’s credit ratings (currently AA from
Standard & Poor’s and Aa2 from Moody’s) are downgraded below either A- by Standard & Poor’s or A3 by Moody’s, collateral of up to $1.1 billion could be required to be
posted.  In July 2016, our last remaining credit default contract was terminated by mutual agreement with the
counterparty. We paid $195 million upon termination of the contract.  Our regulated utility subsidiaries are exposed
to variations in the prices of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity purchased and sold and natural gas supplied for customers. Derivative instruments, including forward purchases and sales, futures, swaps and options, are
used to manage a portion of these price risks. Derivative contract assets are included in other assets and were $123 million as of June 30, 2017 and $142 million as of December 31, 2016. Derivative contract liabilities are
included in accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities and were $139 million as of June 30, 2017 and $145 million as of December 31, 2016. Net derivative contract assets or liabilities of our regulated utilities that are
probable of recovery through rates, are offset by regulatory liabilities or assets. Unrealized gains or losses on contracts accounted for as cash flow or fair value hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income or in net earnings, as
appropriate.

 Note 16. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
The liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under our
short duration property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims.

Note 16. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued) 
 
Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first six months of 2017
and 2016 reflected decreases of $199 million and $1,071 million, respectively, in the estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years’ events. In the first six months of 2017, the decrease included a $532 million decrease
related to primary insurance operations (primarily private passenger automobile, healthcare malpractice and workers’ compensation coverages), which was partly offset by an increase attributable to reinsurance operations. The increase related to
our reinsurance operations included $215 million with respect to certain personal injury claims in the United Kingdom due to a regulatory decision that increases calculated lump sum settlement amounts. In addition, during 2017, we increased
ultimate liability estimates under certain reinsurance contracts due to higher than expected reported losses from hurricane and earthquake events that occurred in 2016. In the first six months of 2016, we reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for
prior accident years’ events for reinsurance operations ($619 million) and primary insurance ($452 million). The reductions related to reinsurance operations were primarily attributable to lower than expected reported losses, while the
reductions for primary insurance primarily related to private passenger automobile, healthcare malpractice and workers’ compensation coverages. 
In January 2017, a Berkshire subsidiary, National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), entered into a retroactive reinsurance
agreement with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”). NICO received cash consideration of $10.2 billion and agreed to indemnify AIG for 80% of up to $25 billion, excess of
$25 billion retained by AIG, of losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses with respect to certain commercial insurance loss events occurring in years prior to 2016. The transaction became effective on February 2, 2017. Berkshire agreed
to guarantee the timely payment of all amounts due to AIG under the agreement.  We accounted for the AIG agreement as
retroactive reinsurance of short-duration insurance contracts. As of the effective date, we recorded premiums earned and losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred of $10.2 billion. We also recorded a liability for unpaid losses and loss
adjustment expenses of $16.4 billion, representing the estimated ultimate liabilities assumed, and a deferred charge reinsurance assumed asset of $6.2 billion, representing the excess of the liability over the premiums earned. This
deferred charge asset will be amortized over the estimated claims settlement period using the interest method based on the estimated timing and amount of future loss payments. Amortization charges are included in losses and loss adjustment expenses
in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  Note 17. Notes payable and other borrowings 
Notes payable and other borrowings are summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity

 In January 2017, Berkshire issued €1.1 billion in senior unsecured notes. The notes
consisted of €550 million of 0.25% notes due in 2021 and €550 million of 0.625% notes due in 2023. In January 2017, senior notes of $1.1 billion matured. The increase in the carrying value of Berkshire’s Euro
denominated senior notes in the first six months of 2017 included $597 million that was charged to earnings as additional interest expense for the first six months of 2017 (including $526 million in the second quarter) and resulted from
the revaluation attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

 BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements.
Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants including, but not limited to, leverage ratios,
interest coverage ratios and debt service coverage ratios. During the first six months of 2017, BHE and its subsidiaries issued approximately $1.275 billion of debt with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2057 and a weighted average interest
rate of 3.7%.  BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. In March 2017, BNSF issued
$1.25 billion of senior unsecured debentures consisting of $500 million of 3.25% debentures due in 2027 and $750 million of 4.125% debentures due in 2047. In May 2017, $650 million of BNSF debentures matured. As of June 30,
2017, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries.

 In January 2017, BHFC issued $1.3 billion of senior notes consisting of $950 million
of floating rate notes due in 2019 and $350 million of floating rate notes due in 2020. In the first six months of 2017, senior notes of $2.4 billion matured. The borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, are
fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire.  As of June 30, 2017, our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit
and commercial paper capacity aggregating approximately $8.4 billion to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Such unused lines of credit included about $4.8 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. In
addition to BHFC’s borrowings, at June 30, 2017, Berkshire guaranteed approximately $2.6 billion of other subsidiary borrowings. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations.

Note 18. Fair value measurements (Continued)  
 
The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were
measured using market or income approaches. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the fair values presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that
could be realized in an actual current market exchange. The use of alternative market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1
through 3, which are described below.  Level 1—Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets
or liabilities exchanged in active markets.  Level 2—Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs
(other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in
fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by
observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated
durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector.  Level
3—Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or
liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or
liabilities.  Reconciliations of assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the
use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the six months ending June 30, 2017 and 2016 follow (in millions).

Note 18. Fair value measurements (Continued)  
 
As disclosed in Note 7, we expect to exercise our BAC Warrants in the third
quarter of 2017 using the BAC Preferred as consideration and additionally, RBI intends to redeem our RBI Preferred investment. As of June 30, 2017, we based our valuations of these investments on these expectations and we significantly reduced
expected durations and effectively eliminated the discounts for transferability and other restrictions. As a result, we concluded the Level 3 inputs used in the previous fair value determinations of our investments in BAC Warrants and RBI
Preferred were not significant and that the valuations of such investments were Level 2 measurements as of June 30, 2017. 
Quantitative information as of June 30, 2017, with respect to significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at
fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) follows (in millions).

Volatility
 
  
 
19%
 
 Our equity index put option contracts are illiquid and contain contract terms that are not
standard in derivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts and certain of the contracts have relatively long durations. For these and other reasons, we classified these contracts as Level 3.
The methods we use to value these contracts are those that we believe market participants would use in determining exchange prices with respect to our contracts. 
We value equity index put option contracts based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Inputs to this model include
index price, contract duration and dividend and interest rate inputs (including a Berkshire non-performance input) which are observable. However, we believe that the valuation of long-duration options using
any model is inherently subjective and, given the lack of observable transactions and prices, acceptable values may be subject to wide ranges. Volatility inputs represent our expectations, which consider the remaining duration of each contract and
assume that the contracts will remain outstanding until the expiration dates. Increases or decreases in the volatility inputs will produce increases or decreases in the fair values of the liabilities.

 Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock
possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equivalent to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and
Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A
common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,644,603 shares outstanding as of June 30, 2017 and 1,644,321 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2016. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
 
Note 19. Common stock (Continued)  
 
Berkshire’s Board of Directors (“Berkshire’s Board”) has
approved a common stock repurchase program under which Berkshire may repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. Berkshire may repurchase shares in the open market or
through privately negotiated transactions. Berkshire’s Board authorization does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s
consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $20 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no
expiration date to the program.  Note 20. Accumulated other comprehensive income 
A summary of the net changes in after-tax accumulated other comprehensive income
attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders and significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income for the six months ending June 30, 2017 and 2016 follows (in millions).

Note 21. Contingencies and Commitments 
We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions
seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and
routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to
impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
In the third quarter of 2016, NICO entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Medical Liability Mutual Insurance Company
(“MLMIC”), a writer of medical professional liability insurance domiciled in New York. MLMIC’s assets and policyholders’ surplus determined under statutory accounting principles as of March 31, 2017 were approximately
$5.6 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. The acquisition price will be an amount equal to the sum of: (i) the tangible book value of MLMIC at the closing date (determined under U.S. GAAP); plus (ii) $100 million. The
acquisition will involve the conversion of MLMIC from a mutual company to a stock company. The closing of the transaction is subject to various regulatory approvals, customary closing conditions and the approval of the MLMIC policyholders eligible
to vote on the proposed demutualization and sale. We currently expect this transaction will be completed in late 2017. 
We own a 50% interest in a joint venture, Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), with Leucadia National
Corporation (“Leucadia”) owning the other 50% interest. Berkadia is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S. A significant source of funding for Berkadia’s operations is through the issuance of commercial paper, which is
limited to $1.5 billion. Berkadia’s commercial paper outstanding is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Leucadia has agreed to indemnify us for one-half of any
losses we incur under the policy.  On July 7, 2017, Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) agreed to
acquire 80.03% of the outstanding equity interests of Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC (“Oncor”) for $9 billion pursuant to an agreement between BHE and Energy Future Holdings Corp. (“EFH”). Since April 2014, EFH and the
substantial majority of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, excluding Oncor, have operated as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
and pursuant to Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  Oncor is a regulated electricity transmission and distribution
company that operates the largest transmission and distribution system in Texas, delivering electricity to more than 3.4 million homes and businesses and operating more than 122,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines. Texas
Transmission Investment LLC owns 19.75% and certain Oncor directors, employees and retirees own the remaining 0.22% of Oncor’s equity interests. BHE intends to acquire the remaining 19.97% minority interest positions in Oncor through
transactions separate from the agreement with EFH.  The completion of this transaction is subject to numerous approvals,
rulings and conditions, including those from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the Public Utility Commission of Texas and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), and the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Subject to obtaining the necessary approvals, we expect the transaction between BHE and EFH will close in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Note 22. Business segment data 
Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, finance, manufacturing, service and retailing
businesses. Our reportable business segments are organized in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses have been grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines,
marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. Revenues by segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in millions).

 Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. We manage our
operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our corporate
headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for
significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance
practices, including, but not limited to, communicating the appropriate “tone at the top” messages to employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution
of governance-related issues as needed. The business segment data (Note 22 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. 
Our insurance businesses generated after-tax losses from underwriting in the second
quarter and first six months of 2017. These losses included foreign currency exchange rate losses from the revaluation of reinsurance liabilities denominated in foreign currencies of $122 million in the second quarter and $196 million in
the first six months of 2017. Our after-tax underwriting earnings in 2016 included foreign currency exchange rate gains of $185 million in the second quarter and $223 million in the first six months.
Additionally, underwriting results in 2017 declined as compared to 2016 due to decreased earnings from the re-estimation of ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events, higher losses from current
year catastrophe events and increased deferred charge amortization on retroactive reinsurance contracts. Our railroad business generated comparative increases in earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 compared to 2016,
reflecting increased unit volume, partly offset by increased fuel and other costs. Our utility and energy business produced higher earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting lower effective income tax
rates. Earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2017 increased 11.3% in the second quarter and 8.0% in the first six months compared to the same periods in 2016. These increases reflected comparatively higher earnings from
several of our larger operations and the impact of businesses acquired in 2016 (PCC and Duracell), partly offset by losses and impairment charges related to the disposition of a prior bolt-on acquisition by
one of our manufacturing businesses.  After-tax investment and derivative gains in
the second quarter and first six months of 2017 were $143 million and $647 million, respectively, and $394 million and $2.25 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively.
After-tax investment gains in the first six months of 2016 included a non-cash gain of approximately $1.9 billion related to the exchange of P&G common stock
for 100% of the common stock of Duracell. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported results or evaluating our economic performance. Investment and derivative gains and losses
have caused and will likely continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Other earnings in 2017 are net of after-tax foreign currency exchange rate losses of $342 million in the
second quarter and $399 million for the first six months from the revaluation of parent company Euro denominated notes payable. In 2016, other earnings included after-tax foreign currency exchange rate
gains of $101 million in the second quarter and losses of $60 million in the first six months from the revaluation of Euro denominated notes payable. 
Insurance—Underwriting 
We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance
activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers
have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are disaggregated as follows: GEICO, General Re, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Continued)   
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) 
 
Our management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct
operations – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing decisions, with limited exceptions, are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett.
Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. 
The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results,
particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Our periodic underwriting results may be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior
years. Actual claim settlements and revised loss estimates will develop over time and the unpaid loss estimates recorded as of the balance sheet date will develop upward or downward in future periods, producing a corresponding decrease or increase
to pre-tax earnings. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar
denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rates can be volatile and the resulting impact on our underwriting earnings can be
relatively significant. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below. Amounts are in millions.

 Premiums written in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 increased
$1.0 billion (16.7%) and $2.1 billion (16.1%), respectively, compared to 2016. Over the past year, voluntary auto policies-in-force grew approximately 10.2%
and premiums per auto policy increased 5.0%. The increase in average premiums per policy was attributable to rate increases, coverage changes and changes in state and risk mix. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2017 increased 17.8% in the second
quarter and 24.1% in the first six months compared to the same periods in 2016. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 876,000 during the first six
months of 2017. Premiums earned in 2017 increased 16.0% in the second quarter and 14.6% in the first six months compared to the same periods in 2016.

In the second quarter and first six months of 2017, our pre-tax underwriting gains declined compared to 2016, as claim costs grew faster than premiums earned. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2017 increased $935 million (18.1%) in the second quarter and
$1.7 billion (17.0%) in the first six months over the corresponding periods in 2016. Our loss ratio (the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to earned premiums) increased 1.5 percentage points in the second quarter and 1.7 percentage
points in the first six months of 2017 as compared to 2016. Claims frequencies in the first six months of 2017 were relatively flat for property damage and collision coverages, increased approximately three percent for bodily injury coverage and
decreased about two percent for personal injury protection coverage compared to 2016. Average claims severities were higher in the first six months of 2017 for property damage and collision coverages (four to five percent range) and bodily injury
coverage (four to six percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first six months of 2017 and 2016 included reductions of $106 million and $216 million, respectively, from the
re-estimation of liabilities for prior years’ claims. In addition, in the first six months of 2017, we incurred storm losses of approximately $268 million (1.9% of premiums earned), compared to
$290 million (2.4% of premiums earned) in the first six months of 2016.  Underwriting expenses in the second quarter
and first six months of 2017 increased $93 million (10.1%) and $210 million (11.1%), respectively, compared to 2016. Our expense ratios (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) in 2017 declined 0.7 percentage points in the second quarter
and 0.4 percentage points in the first six months compared to 2016. The largest components of underwriting expenses are employee-related expenses (salaries and benefits) and advertising costs.

 Property/casualty 
In the second quarter and first six months of 2017, property/casualty premiums earned increased $153 million (25%) and
$155 million (12%), respectively, as compared to 2016. The increases reflected higher written premiums in both direct and broker markets, primarily attributable to new business and increased participations for renewals. Despite the increase in
premiums in 2017, industry capacity dedicated to property and casualty markets remains high and price competition in most reinsurance markets persists. We continue to decline business when we believe prices are inadequate. 
Our property/casualty operations generated pre-tax underwriting losses of
$14 million in the second quarter and $157 million in the first six months of 2017 compared to pre-tax underwriting gains of $23 million and $53 million, respectively, in the comparable
2016 periods. In the first six months of 2017, we increased our estimates for unpaid losses approximately $140 million with respect to certain United Kingdom (“U.K.”) liability business written in prior years. The increase was the
result of the U.K. Ministry of Justice’s decision in the first quarter to reduce the fixed discount rate required in lump sum settlement calculations of U.K. personal injury claims. The discount rate, referred to as the Ogden rate, was reduced
from 2.5% to negative 0.75%. We expect the Ogden rate decrease will significantly increase claim costs associated with currently unsettled cases, as well as for future cases. Underwriting results in the first six months of 2017 also included
estimated losses of $50 million from a cyclone in Australia. General Re incurred no losses from significant catastrophe loss events in the first six months of 2016.

Life/health 
Life/health premiums earned in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 increased $36 million (5%) and
$35 million (2%), respectively, compared to 2016. The increases reflected growth in North America and certain international markets. Our life/health operations produced pre-tax underwriting gains of
$39 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 compared to pre-tax underwriting losses of $21 million in the second quarter and $9 million in the first six months of 2016. The
improved underwriting results in 2017 reflected lower underwriting expenses and the impact of increasing liabilities for estimated premium deficiencies on certain disability business in 2016. Underwriting results in the first six months of 2017 and
2016 included pre-tax losses from the runoff of U.S. long-term care and disability business of $38 million and $37 million, respectively, which were primarily due to the periodic discount accretion
on long-term care liabilities.  Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group

 Property/casualty 
In the second quarter and first six months of 2017, premiums earned increased $116 million (11%) and $77 million
(4%), respectively, compared to 2016. Approximately half of our premiums written and earned in the first six months of 2017 derived from two contracts. Our premium volume was constrained for most reinsurance coverages, as rates, in our view, were
generally inadequate. We have the capacity and desire to write more business when prices are appropriate.  Our
property/casualty business generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $52 million in the second quarter and pre-tax losses of $217 million in the first six months
of 2017, compared to pre-tax gains of $249 million in the second quarter and $375 million in the first six months of 2016. In the first six months of 2017, we incurred losses of approximately
$250 million related to prior years’ loss events, which included losses from unanticipated reported claims from hurricane and earthquake events in 2016 and increased liability estimates attributable to the Ogden discount rate decrease. In
the first six months of 2016, we reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events by approximately $375 million, primarily due to lower than expected reported losses. In the first six months of 2017, we also incurred
estimated losses of approximately $115 million from a cyclone in Australia. In the first six months of 2016, we incurred no significant losses from catastrophe loss events. 
Retroactive reinsurance 
We periodically write retroactive reinsurance contracts, which provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses
with respect to past loss events. In January 2017, NICO entered into an aggregate excess-of-loss retroactive reinsurance agreement with AIG (the “AIG
Agreement”) that became effective on February 2, 2017. In connection with the AIG Agreement, we received cash premiums of $10.2 billion. As of the effective date, we recorded losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred of
$10.2 billion, representing our initial estimate of the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses assumed of $16.4 billion, partly offset by a deferred charge asset of $6.2 billion. Thus, on the effective date, the AIG Agreement had
no effect on our pre-tax underwriting results. See Note 16 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Pre-tax underwriting results in 2017 included losses of $102 million in the second
quarter and $191 million in the first six months from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which increased foreign currency denominated liabilities of U.S subsidiaries. In 2016, foreign currency exchange rate changes reduced such
liabilities and resulted in pre-tax gains of $158 million in the second quarter and $177 million in the first six months.

Retroactive reinsurance (Continued) 
 
Before foreign currency gains/losses, retroactive reinsurance contracts
produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $229 million and $399 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively, and $149 million and $259 million, respectively, in
the comparable 2016 periods. The comparative increases in such losses in 2017 were primarily due to deferred charge amortization related to the AIG Agreement and another retroactive reinsurance contract written in December 2016, partly offset by a
small net gain from a contract commuted in the first quarter of 2017 and comparatively lower deferred charge amortization from other contracts. We currently estimate pre-tax deferred charge amortization for
the year ending December 31, 2017 will approximate $975 million, which includes the aforementioned AIG Agreement. 
Liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with our retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately
$40.1 billion at June 30, 2017 and $24.7 billion at December 31, 2016. Unamortized deferred charges related to these contracts were approximately $13.5 billion at June 30, 2017 and $8.0 billion at December 31,
2016.  Life and annuity

 Periodic payment annuity premiums consist of upfront consideration received under direct and
assumed contracts that provide for structured settlement annuity payments, typically over very long periods. Pre-tax underwriting losses in 2017 included losses of $86 million in the second quarter and
$110 million in the first six months from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In 2016, foreign currency exchange rate changes resulted in pre-tax gains of $126 million in the second quarter
and $166 million in the first six months.  Before foreign currency gains and losses,
pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts were $112 million in the second quarter and $233 million in the first six months of 2017 and $118 million and
$228 million, respectively, in the second quarter and first six months of 2016. We expect these contracts will generate pre-tax underwriting losses over time attributable to the accretion of discounted
annuity liabilities. Discounted periodic payment annuity liabilities were approximately $10.6 billion at June 30, 2017, reflecting a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.1%. 
Our underwriting results in 2017 from life reinsurance included higher than expected mortality, partially offset by decreased
benefit liabilities for certain blocks of business. Underwriting gains in 2016 reflected lower claims and underwriting expenses. 
Underwriting results of our variable annuity business (reinsurance contracts that provide guarantees on closed blocks of
variable annuity business) in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $74 million and $152 million, respectively, and
pre-tax underwriting losses of $85 million and $140 million, respectively, in the corresponding periods of 2016. Underwriting gains and losses in each period reflected changes in liabilities for
guaranteed benefits, resulting from changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the periodic recognition of expected profit margins, which together, affected our liability estimates. Our estimated liabilities for variable annuity
guarantees were approximately $1.9 billion at June 30, 2017 and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2016. Periodic underwriting results from these contracts can be volatile reflecting the volatility of securities markets.

 Premiums written in the second quarter and first six months in 2017 increased 8.9% and 13.2%,
respectively, over the same periods in 2016. All of the BH Primary insurers generated increased premiums written in the first six months of 2017, led by BH Specialty (23%), GUARD (28%) and BHHC (11%). Premiums earned increased $248 million
(16.4%) in the second quarter and $483 million (16.4%) in the first six months as compared to 2016 reflecting the increases in premiums written. 
The BH Primary insurers produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $232 million in the
second quarter and $421 million in the first six months of 2017. Losses and loss adjustment expenses for the first six months of 2017 included net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of
$426 million, which produced a corresponding increase in pre-tax underwriting gains. Underwriting results in the first six months of 2016 included gains of $236 million from the net reductions of
estimated ultimate claims liabilities for prior years’ events. The gains from the development of prior years’ claim estimates in 2017 were primarily attributable to healthcare malpractice and workers’ compensation business. Many of
our businesses write primarily liability and workers’ compensation business and the related claim costs may be subject to higher severity and longer-claims tails, which may contribute to significant claims development gains or losses in the
future.  Insurance—Investment Income

 Pre-tax investment income in the second quarter and
first six months of 2017 increased $48 million (4%) and $35 million (1%), respectively, from the same periods in 2016. These increases reflected increased interest income, partly offset by lower dividend income. We continue to hold
significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills earning very low yields. While still historically low, the yields were higher in 2017 than in 2016. We believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on
safety over yield with respect to such balances. The decrease in dividends in 2017 reflected Dow Chemical Company’s redemption of our $3 billion investment in 8.5% preferred stock in December 2016, partly offset by increased dividend
income from investments in other equity securities attributable to increased dividend rates of certain issuers and increased overall investment levels. 
Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net
liabilities under insurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premium and reinsurance
receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $107 billion at June 30, 2017 and $91 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase in float in
2017 was primarily attributable to the AIG Agreement. Our average cost of float was approximately 0.4% in the first six months of 2017, as we generated an aggregate pre-tax underwriting loss of
$403 million.

Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued)
  
Consolidated revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 were
$5.3 billion and $10.4 billion, respectively, representing increases of $665 million (14.5%) and $1,083 million (11.6%), respectively, versus the corresponding periods in 2016. Pre-tax
earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 increased 24.2% and 15.5%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016. 
In the first six months of 2017, revenues reflected a 4.1% comparative increase in average revenue per car/unit and a 7.6%
increase in volume. Our year-to-date volume was 5.0 million cars/units compared to 4.7 million in 2016. We currently expect our overall volume growth will
moderate in the second half of 2017 compared to the growth experienced in the first six months of 2017. The increase in average revenue per car/unit was primarily attributable to higher fuel surcharge revenue and business mix changes, as well as
increased rates per car/unit.  Freight revenues from consumer products in 2017 were $1.7 billion in the second
quarter and $3.4 billion in the first six months, representing increases of 8.4% and 8.6%, respectively, compared to 2016. The revenue increases reflected volume increases of 5.8% in the second quarter and 5.7% in the first six months as well
as higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increases were primarily attributable to higher market share, improving economic conditions, and normalizing of retail inventories, which benefited domestic intermodal, international intermodal and
automotive volumes.  Freight revenues from industrial products in 2017 were $1.3 billion in the second quarter and
$2.5 billion for the first six months, or increases of 7.4% and 5.7%, respectively, from the comparable 2016 periods. The increases were attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit, as well as volume increases of 4.1% in the second
quarter and 2.3% in the first six months. Volumes in 2017 were higher for minerals, steel and other commodities that support domestic drilling activity as well as higher taconite, partly offset by lower petroleum products volume, due to pipeline
displacement of U.S. crude traffic, and lower plastics volume.  Freight revenues from agricultural products in 2017
increased 18.0% in the second quarter to $1.1 billion and increased 11.4% to $2.2 billion in the first six months compared to the same periods in 2016. The revenue growth reflected higher volumes, 14.5% in the second quarter and 7.8% for
the first six months, as well as higher revenue per car/unit. The volume growth in 2017 was primarily due to higher grain exports. 
Freight revenues from coal in 2017 increased 39.2% in the second quarter to $912 million and 30.5% in the first six
months to $1.9 billion compared to 2016. The increase in revenues reflected higher volumes, 20.7% in the second quarter and 19.5% year-to-date, as well as higher
average revenue per car/unit. The volume increases in 2017 were due to mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2016 and higher natural gas prices in the first half of 2017. Together, these factors led to increased utility coal usage in 2017,
which were partly offset by the effects of unit retirements of coal generating facilities.  Operating expenses in the
second quarter and first six months of 2017 were $3.5 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively, increases of $359 million (11.6%) and $683 million (10.7%), respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016. Our ratios of
operating expenses to revenues decreased 1.7 percentage points to 65.8% in the second quarter and 0.5 percentage points to 67.5% for the first six months of 2017 versus the corresponding 2016 periods. 
Compensation and benefits expenses increased $108 million (9.5%) for the second quarter and $183 million (7.8%) for
the first six months compared to 2016. The increases were primarily due to higher health and welfare costs, wage inflation and volume-related increases. Fuel expenses increased $146 million (33.9%) for the second quarter and
$356 million (43.1%) for the first six months compared to 2016, due to higher average fuel prices and increased volumes, partially offset by improved efficiency. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $62 million (11.7%) for
the second quarter and $115 million (11.0%) for the first six months compared to 2016 due to a larger base of depreciable assets in service.

 PacifiCorp 
PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming.
Revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 increased $13 million (1%) and $41 million (2%), respectively, compared with 2016. In the second quarter and first six months of 2017, wholesale and other revenues increased due
to higher volumes and average rates. In the second quarter of 2017, retail revenues declined slightly and for the first six months increased $14 million, due to higher volumes, partly offset by lower average rates. 
EBIT in the second quarter of 2017 was unchanged from 2016, as a slight increase in gross margins and lower operations and
maintenance expenses were substantially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense. EBIT increased $21 million (4%) in the first six months of 2017, as compared to 2016. The comparative increase in EBIT was primarily due to an
increase in gross margins ($18 million) and lower operations and maintenance expenses ($22 million), partially offset by increased depreciation, amortization and property tax expenses ($18 million). 
MidAmerican Energy Company 
MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. Revenues in the second quarter of
2017 increased $76 million (13%) compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to increases in electric operating revenues ($56 million), due principally to higher wholesale volumes and rates, and natural gas revenues ($18 million) due
to higher average per-unit cost of gas sold (offset in cost of sales). EBIT in the second quarter of 2017 decreased $5 million (5%) compared to 2016. Although revenues and gross margin dollars
increased in the second quarter, average gross margin percentages declined due to higher coal-fueled generation and purchased power costs. In addition, in the second quarter of 2017, operating expenses increased $42 million compared to 2016,
which included an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $31 million attributable to higher regulatory provisions and increased assets in service. 
Revenues in the first six months of 2017 increased $152 million (12%) compared to 2016. The increase reflected
increases in electric operating revenues ($90 million) and natural gas operating revenues ($54 million). The increase in electric revenues was attributable to higher wholesale and other revenue ($67 million), substantially due to higher wholesale
volumes and average rates, and increased retail revenues ($23 million). The increase in retail revenues reflected increased recoveries through bill riders (which are substantially offset by increases in costs and expenses) and from non-weather usage and rate factors, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of temperatures in 2017. EBIT in the first six months of 2017 increased $4 million (3%) compared to 2016. The increase in EBIT
reflected the increases in revenues substantially offset by higher coal-fueled generation and purchased power costs, higher per-unit cost of natural gas sold and increased depreciation, maintenance and other operating expenses.

Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”)
(Continued)   
NV Energy 
NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. Revenues increased $47 million (7%) in the
second quarter and $17 million (1%) in the first six months of 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016. These increases were due primarily to increases in retail electric operating revenues, which reflected a combination of increased rates
from pass-through cost adjustments and higher volumes, partly offset by lower revenues from energy efficiency programs, which are offset by lower operating expenses. In 2017, NV Energy also experienced declines in operating revenues from commercial
and industrial customers electing to purchase power from alternative sources and, thus, becoming distribution service only customers. Natural gas operating revenue decreased in the first six months of 2017 primarily due to lower rates, partially
offset by higher customer usage.  EBIT increased $23 million (19%) in the second quarter and $42 million
(28%) in the first six months of 2017 compared to the corresponding 2016 periods. These increases were primarily due to increased gross margins and lower interest expense. 
Northern Powergrid 
Revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 declined $30 million (12%) and $64 million (12%) compared
to 2016, primarily due to the unfavorable currency translation effect of a comparatively stronger U.S. Dollar in 2017 and lower distribution revenue, partially offset by higher smart metering revenue. Changes in the average foreign currency
exchange rates accounted for $27 million and $65 million of the comparative revenue declines in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively. Distribution revenues in the first six months of 2017 declined primarily due to
the recovery in the first quarter of 2016 of the December 2013 customer rebate ($11 million), unfavorable movements in regulatory provisions and lower distribution volumes ($12 million), partially offset by higher tariff rates
($15 million). EBIT in the first six months of 2017 declined $50 million (23%) compared to 2016, primarily due to foreign currency translation effects, as well as higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service and increased pension expenses.  Natural gas pipelines 
Revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 were relatively unchanged from 2016. In the first six months of
2017, higher gas sales, primarily from system balancing activities (largely offset in cost of sales), and higher transportation revenues at Northern Natural Gas were offset by lower transportation revenues at Kern River. EBIT in the first six months
of 2017 increased $14 million (6%) compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to a reduction in expenses and regulatory liabilities related to the impact of an alternative rate structure approved by Kern River’s regulators in
the first quarter of 2017 and from the changes in transportation revenues.  Other energy businesses 
Revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 increased $102 million (22%) and $107 million (11%),
respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016. These increases were primarily due to the effects of a decision in May 2016 by AltaLink’s regulator, which changed the timing of when construction-in-progress expenditures included in rate base are billable to customers and earned in revenues. The decision resulted in a one-time net reduction in
revenue in the second quarter of 2016, with an offsetting reduction in expenses. Otherwise, operating revenues from renewable energy increased 18% in the first six months of 2017 due to increased assets in service and increased solar generation,
while revenues from the unregulated retail services business declined 9%. EBIT in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 declined 8% and 14%, respectively, compared to 2016. The declines reflected higher other operating costs, partly offset
by increased earnings from renewable energy.  Real estate brokerage 
Revenues in the first six months of 2017 increased $207 million (15%) compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to
recent business acquisitions, and modest increases in closed sales units and average transaction prices for existing businesses. EBIT in the first six months of 2017 increased $18 million as compared to 2016. 
Corporate interest and income taxes 
Corporate interest includes interest on unsecured debt issued by BHE and borrowings from certain Berkshire insurance
subsidiaries. BHE’s consolidated effective income tax rates for the first six months of 2017 and 2016 were approximately 11% and 16%, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased primarily due to an increase in production tax credits
recognized and lower consolidated deferred state income tax expenses due to changes in the tax status of certain subsidiaries.

 Aggregate revenues from manufacturing increased $537 million (4%) in the second
quarter and $2.1 billion (9%) in the first six months of 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016. Pre-tax earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 were $1.9 billion and
$3.4 billion, respectively, representing increases of $252 million (15%) and $257 million (8%), respectively, over earnings in the corresponding 2016 periods. In 2016, operating results of our industrial products and consumer products
businesses included the results of PCC and Duracell from their respective acquisition dates. Pre-tax earnings in the first six months of 2017 also included pre-tax
losses of $193 million in connection with the disposition of an underperforming bolt-on business acquired by Lubrizol in 2014. 
Industrial products 
Revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 increased $132 million (2%) and $946 million (8%),
respectively, compared to the corresponding 2016 periods. In the second quarter, revenues of the IMC group increased 9%, PCC and Marmon each increased 2% and LSPI increased 36%, while revenues of Lubrizol declined 2%. The increases from IMC and LSPI
were primarily due to increased unit sales. PCC’s revenues increased 17% in the first six months of 2017 compared to the five-month post-acquisition period in 2016. Comparatively higher unit sales drove year-to-date revenue increases of LSPI (17%) and IMC (8%), while increases from business acquisitions, partly offset by lower average selling prices and mix changes accounted for CTB’s 5% year-to-date revenue

increase. Marmon’s revenues increased 3% in the first six months of 2017 versus 2016, reflecting a mixture of increases from business acquisitions and higher average metal prices, partly
offset by lower demand at some of its business units, particularly those that provide products for the retail, industrial equipment, agricultural, wire products and grocery store markets. On a comparable full year-to-date basis, PCC’s revenues increased approximately 3% compared to 2016. In 2017, PCC experienced revenue increases from structural castings, airfoils and industrial gas turbine products and from
new business acquisitions, which were partly offset by lower revenues from airframe products.  Pre-tax earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 increased $134 million (12%) and $74 million (3%), respectively, compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2016. In the
second quarter and first six months of 2017, PCC, IMC and LSPI generated earnings increases, while earnings from Lubrizol and CTB were lower. Lubrizol recognized pre-tax losses of $193 million in the
first six months of 2017, substantially all of which was in the first quarter, related to the disposition of an underperforming bolt-on business and related intangible asset impairment and restructuring
charges. Over the first six months of 2017, Lubrizol, CTB, as well as certain other businesses, experienced selling price pressures and higher manufacturing costs, driven by increased prices for petroleum-based materials and certain metals, which
contributed to comparative pre-tax earnings declines. We continue to implement cost containment and other initiatives intended to improve productivity at several of our businesses. 
Building products 
Revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 increased $278 million (10%) and $551 million (10%),
respectively, compared to 2016. The increases were primarily due to the effect of bolt-on business acquisitions (Shaw and MiTek) and sales volume increases (MiTek and Johns Manville), partly offset by
lower average sales prices and changes in product mix.  Pre-tax earnings in the
second quarter and first six months of 2017 increased $96 million (31%) and $103 million (19%), respectively, compared to 2016. These increases were attributable to asset impairment, pension settlement and environmental claim charges
recorded in the second quarter of 2016 by Shaw and Benjamin Moore (aggregating about $90 million), and earnings from recent bolt-on acquisitions, partly offset by comparative declines in the average gross
margin rates. Over the first six months of 2017, a combination of lower average selling prices and higher average raw materials costs negatively affected the operating results of our building products businesses. 
Consumer products 
Revenues increased $127 million (4%) in the second quarter and $583 million (11%) in the first six months of
2017 compared to the corresponding 2016 periods. The second quarter revenue increase included a 12% comparative increase at Forest River, attributable to an 11% increase in unit sales. The increase in revenues for the first six months reflected a
74% increase in revenues of Duracell, which we acquired February 29, 2016, and a 9% increase in Forest River’s revenues, primarily due to a 10% increase in unit sales. Apparel revenues in the first six months of 2017 declined slightly (1%)
compared to 2016.  Pre-tax earnings in the second quarter and first six months of
2017 increased $22 million (9%) and $80 million (18%), respectively, compared to 2016. The increases in earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 were primarily due to increased earnings from Duracell and Forest
River, partly offset by lower apparel earnings. Duracell’s comparative results in the 2017 periods reflected significant decreases in transition and integration costs arising from the acquisition in 2016 and otherwise improved operating
results. The declines in apparel earnings were primarily attributable to Fruit of the Loom, reflecting the impact of lower gross margins and higher operating expenses.

Service   
Our service businesses offer fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training
to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI) and service a network of quick service restaurant franchises (Dairy Queen). Service businesses also include the electronic distribution of corporate news,
multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire), publication of newspapers and other publications (Buffalo News and the BH Media Group) and operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). We also offer third party logistics services
that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage).  Revenues in the second quarter and first
six months of 2017 increased $215 million (8%) and 471 million (10%), respectively, as compared to 2016. The increases were primarily due to increases from NetJets and TTI. The revenue increases at NetJets reflected increases in
aircraft sales and lease revenues and a 4% year-to-date increase in revenue flight hours. The increases in TTI’s revenues were primarily due to unit volume increases in most of its markets. 
Pre-tax earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 increased
$55 million (19%) and $90 million (17%), respectively, compared to 2016. The increases in earnings were primarily attributable to increased earnings of NetJets and TTI partly offset by lower earnings from media and logistics services
businesses.  Retailing 
Our retailing businesses include four distinct home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey,
Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. Our retailers also include Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (“BHA”). BHA includes 83 auto dealerships, which sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair and other related services and products. BHA also includes two related insurance businesses, two auto auctions and a distributor of automotive fluid maintenance products. 
Our other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s
Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a Germany-based retailer of motorcycle
accessories.  Revenues of our retailing businesses in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 decreased (1%) as
compared to the same periods in 2016. These decreases were primarily due to lower revenues at BHA as a result of lower vehicle units sold, partly offset by increases in revenues of our home furnishings retailers, Pampered Chef and See’s
Candies.  Pre-tax earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 from
retailing increased $43 million (27%) and $77 million (30%) over 2016. These increases reflected higher earnings from BHA, our home furnishings retailers, Pampered Chef and See’s Candies. The earnings increases of BHA were
primarily due to increased earnings from service, finance and insurance activities, partly offset by lower auto sales margins. The earnings increases from our home furnishings retailers were attributable to overall increases in the gross margin
rates and relatively lower operating expenses. The increases from Pampered Chef and See’s Candies were primarily attributable to year-to-date revenue increases of
13% and 4%, respectively, and cost management efforts.  McLane Company 
McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food
consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The
grocery and foodservice units are marked by high sales volumes and very low profit margins and have several significant customers, including Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven and Yum!
Brands. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on McLane’s periodic revenues and earnings. 
Revenues for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 were $12.6 billion and $24.7 billion, respectively,
increases of 4.4% and 3.5% over the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively. The increase in revenues for the first six months of 2017 was primarily due to a 4.6% increase in grocery sales.
Pre-tax earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 were $69 million and $157 million, respectively, decreases of $60 million (47%) and $108 million (41%) compared to
corresponding 2016 periods. The earnings declines reflected a 59% decline in year-to-date earnings of our grocery operations. In 2017, significant pricing pressures and
an increasingly competitive business environment negatively affected our operating results, particularly with respect to our grocery business. These conditions, together with increased fuel, trucking, insurance and depreciation expenses contributed
to a 47 basis point decline in our overall operating margin (ratio of pre-tax earnings to revenues) for the first six months of 2017.

 Manufactured housing and finance 
Clayton Homes’ revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 increased $134 million (13%) and
$315 million (16%), respectively, compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2016. These increases were primarily due to higher home sales, attributable a 14%
year-to-date increase in unit sales and higher average prices, which were primarily due to sales mix changes. In 2017, home sales included a higher mix of site built
homes, which have a higher land content and therefore unit prices tend to be higher. Site built gross sales margin rates, however, are typically lower than manufactured homes. Pre-tax earnings increased
$18 million (10%) in the second quarter and $24 million (7%) in the first six months of 2017 compared to the corresponding 2016 periods. Earnings in the first six months of 2017 included a gain of $11 million from a legal
settlement. The earnings increases in 2017 also reflected increased earnings from manufacturing and retailing activities, comparatively lower servicing asset impairment charges and increased earnings from insurance services, partly offset by
increased employee healthcare, technology, marketing and legal expenses.  Transportation equipment leasing 
Transportation equipment leasing revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 decreased $19 million (3%)
and $78 million (6%), respectively, compared to 2016. The declines were primarily due to comparative declines in leasing revenues, attributable to lower railcar and trailer fleet utilization rates, lower railcar rental renewal rates, and
lower volume for crane services, partly offset by increases in repair revenues and lease termination fees. In the first six months of 2017, we also experienced lower tank car sales to third parties, although demand increased during the second
quarter.  Pre-tax earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2017
declined $24 million (10%) and $66 million (13%), respectively, compared to 2016. These decreases reflected the aforementioned revenue declines and higher railcar repair and storage costs. In 2017, interest expense also increased due to
increased borrowings from a Berkshire financing subsidiary, partly offset by lower interest expense on third party borrowings. Significant components of our operating costs, such as depreciation expense, do not vary proportionately to revenue
changes. Therefore, changes in revenues can disproportionately impact earnings.  Other 
Earnings from other finance activities include CORT furniture leasing, our share of the earnings of a commercial mortgage
servicing business (“Berkadia”) in which we own a 50% joint venture interest, and interest and dividends from a portfolio of investments. Pre-tax earnings in the first six months of 2017 declined
$45 million compared to 2016, reflecting lower interest and dividend income from investments and lower earnings from CORT. Other earnings also includes income from interest rate spreads charged on borrowings by a Berkshire financing subsidiary
that are used to finance loans and assets held for lease. The corresponding expenses are included in the results of our manufactured housing and finance and transportation equipment business groups. Pre-tax interest rate spreads charged to these
businesses were $39 million in the first six months of 2017 and $35 million in 2016.

 Investment gains/losses 
Investment gains/losses arise primarily from the sale, redemption or exchange of investments. The timing of gains or losses can
have a material effect on periodic earnings. Investment gains and losses included in earnings usually have minimal impact on the periodic changes in our consolidated shareholders’ equity since most of our investments are recorded at fair value
with the unrealized gains and losses included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. 
We believe the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings in any given period typically has little analytical or
predictive value. Our decisions to sell securities are not motivated by the impact that the resulting gains or losses will have on our reported earnings. Although we do not consider investment gains and losses as necessarily meaningful or useful in
evaluating our periodic results, we are providing information to explain the nature of such gains and losses when reflected in our earnings. 
Pre-tax investment gains in the first six months of 2017 and 2016 were
$605 million and $2.5 billion, respectively. Pre-tax investment gains in the first quarter of 2016 included $1.1 billion realized in connection with the
tax-free exchange of shares of P&G common stock for 100% of the common stock of Duracell. Income tax expense allocated to investment gains included a benefit from the reduction of certain deferred income
tax liabilities in connection with the exchange of P&G common stock for Duracell. Our after-tax gain from this transaction was approximately $1.9 billion. In addition, investment gains in the second
quarter and first six months of 2016 included a pre-tax gain of $610 million from the redemption of our Kraft Heinz Preferred Stock investment for cash of $8.32 billion. 
As of January 1, 2018, we will adopt a new accounting standard that changes the reporting of unrealized gains and losses
on investments in equity securities and certain other investments. Upon adoption of this accounting standard, we will reclassify the net unrealized gains from such investments, which are presently reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income,
to retained earnings. The amount of the reclassification will be based on our equity investments at December 31, 2017. As of June 30, 2017, accumulated after-tax net unrealized appreciation related
to our equity securities and other investments was approximately $50.6 billion. After December 31, 2017, the unrealized gains and losses on equity securities currently reported in other comprehensive income, as well as gains and losses
realized from sales and dispositions, will be included in our periodic Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We do not expect the adoption of this standard will affect our total consolidated shareholders’ equity. However, it will likely produce
a very significant increase in the volatility of our periodic net earnings given the magnitude of our existing equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. In the first six months of 2017, our other
comprehensive income included after-tax unrealized gains from equity securities and other investments of approximately $8.2 billion, compared to after-tax unrealized losses of approximately $3.4 billion in the first six months of 2016. These amounts
would be included in earnings under the new accounting standard.

Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued) 
 
Derivative gains/losses 
  Derivative gains/losses currently represent the changes
in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities. The periodic changes in the fair values of these contracts are recorded in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of underlying equity markets and the changes in
the inputs used to measure such liabilities.  Derivative contracts produced pre-tax
gains of $395 million in the first six months of 2017 and pre-tax losses of $790 million in 2016. In July 2016, our last remaining credit default contract was terminated and thereafter, all of our
derivative contract gains and losses derived from our equity index put option contracts. The gains in the first six months of 2017 were primarily attributable to increased index values and shorter contract durations, partly offset by unfavorable
foreign currency exchange rate changes. The losses in 2016 were driven by lower index values and interest rates. As of June 30, 2017, equity index put option intrinsic values were $842 million and our recorded liabilities at fair value
were approximately $2.5 billion. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates (beginning in 2018), and will be based on the intrinsic value as
defined under the contracts.  Other

 Our after-tax Kraft Heinz earnings includes Berkshire’s share of Kraft Heinz’s
earnings attributable to common shareholders determined pursuant to the equity method. In the second quarter and first six months of 2016, Kraft Heinz earnings also included $180 million in pre-tax dividend income from our Preferred Stock
investment, which was redeemed in June 2016. After-tax other earnings (losses) also include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges were primarily
from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions.  In each of the last
three years, Berkshire issued Euro-denominated debt and at June 30, 2017, the aggregate par outstanding was €6.85 billion. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can produce sizable non-cash gains and losses from the periodic
revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. After-tax corporate interest expense included foreign currency exchange rate losses in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 of $342 million and $399 million, respectively, with
respect to the revaluation of the Euro denominated debt. In 2016, after-tax corporate interest included foreign currency exchange rate gains of $101 million in the second quarter and losses of $60 million in the first six months. Excluding
these foreign currency gains and losses, after-tax corporate interest expense in the first six months of 2017 and 2016 was $131 million and $121 million, respectively. The increase was attributable
to increased average outstanding borrowings.  Financial Condition 
Our balance sheet reflects significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Our consolidated shareholders’ equity at
June 30, 2017 was approximately $300.7 billion, an increase of about $17.7 billion since December 31, 2016. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders in the first six months of 2017 were $8.3 billion. Net
unrealized appreciation of investments and foreign currency translation gains included in other comprehensive income in the first six months of 2017 were approximately $8.2 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. 
At June 30, 2017, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of approximately
$86.1 billion and investments (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) of $175.6 billion. In January 2017, Berkshire issued new senior notes aggregating €1.1 billion and repaid $1.1 billion of maturing senior notes.
Berkshire term debt of $800 million will mature in February 2018. Berkshire’s debt outstanding at June 30, 2017 was $18.4 billion, an increase of $678 million from December 31, 2016, which was primarily due to foreign
currency exchange rate changes applicable to €6.85 billion par of Euro-denominated senior notes.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations (Continued)   
Financial Condition (Continued) 
 
Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE)
maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. In the first six months of 2017, capital expenditures were $1.8 billion
by BHE and $1.5 billion by BNSF. We forecast the aggregate capital expenditures of these businesses for the remainder of 2017 will approximate $4.8 billion and we currently expect to fund such future capital expenditures with cash flows
from operations and debt issuances. In July 2017, BHE agreed to acquire approximately 80% of Oncor for $9 billion in cash and intends to acquire the remaining 20% in separate transactions. See Note 21 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements.  BNSF’s outstanding debt approximated $22.6 billion as of June 30, 2017, an increase of
$508 million since December 31, 2016. In March 2017, BNSF issued $1.25 billion of senior unsecured debentures with $500 million due in 2027 and $750 million due in 2047. Approximately $650 million of BNSF debentures
matured in May 2017 and another $650 million mature in March 2018. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries, excluding its borrowings from Berkshire insurance subsidiaries, were approximately $38.1 billion at June 30, 2017,
an increase of $1.1 billion since December 31, 2016. During the first six months of 2017, BHE and its subsidiaries issued approximately $1.275 billion of debt with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2057. Berkshire does not guarantee
the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. 
Finance and financial products assets were approximately $40.9 billion as of June 30, 2017, a decrease of
$830 million from December 31, 2016. Finance assets consist primarily of loans and finance receivables, various types of property held for lease, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills and other investments. Finance and financial
products liabilities decreased approximately $1.9 billion to approximately $17.8 billion as of June 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in borrowings of approximately $1.6 billion, reflecting repayments and
maturities of $2.9 billion, partly offset by $1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in January by a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). The new BHFC notes mature in 2019 and
2020. BHFC’s outstanding borrowings were $13.2 billion at June 30, 2017. Over the remainder of 2017, $400 million of BHFC senior notes will mature and an additional $4.1 billion will mature in the first six months of 2018.
BHFC’s senior note borrowings are used to fund loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and a portion of assets held for lease by our UTLX railcar leasing business. Berkshire guarantees the full and timely payment of principal and
interest with respect to BHFC’s senior notes.  Berkshire’s Board of Directors has authorized Berkshire management
to repurchase, at its discretion, Berkshire Class A and Class B common stock at prices no higher than a 20% premium over book value. There is no obligation to repurchase any stock and the program is expected to continue indefinitely. We
will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount
importance at Berkshire. There were no repurchases in 2017.  Contractual Obligations 
We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to
counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations
pertain to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as minimum rentals under operating leases and certain purchase obligations, and are not currently reflected in the financial statements, but will be recognized in future periods as
the goods are delivered or services are provided.  The timing and amount of the payments under certain contracts, such as
insurance and reinsurance contracts, are contingent upon the outcome of future events and claim settlements. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the estimated liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
As previously discussed, we entered into a retroactive reinsurance agreement with AIG, which became effective in February 2017. In connection with this agreement, we recorded liabilities of $16.4 billion for unpaid losses and loss adjustment
expenses, representing our current estimate of the claims we ultimately expect to pay under the agreement. We estimate future payments under this agreement as follows: 2020-2021 – $3.6 billion and thereafter – $12.8 billion;
however, as generally noted above, actual payments under this agreement will likely vary, perhaps materially, from these estimates. 
Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2017 were, in the
aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in the “Contractual Obligations” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Continued)   
Critical Accounting Policies 
Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based
on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2017 includes estimated liabilities for unpaid losses from property and
casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts of approximately $95 billion. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the process of establishing loss reserve amounts, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded
amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude will result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in
the period of the change.  Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2017 includes goodwill of acquired
businesses of approximately $80 billion. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2016. Although we believe that the goodwill reflected in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet is not impaired, goodwill may subsequently become impaired as a result of changes in facts and circumstances affecting the valuation of the reporting unit. A goodwill impairment charge could have a material effect on periodic earnings.
 Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include significant derivative contract liabilities with respect to our long-duration
equity index put option contracts. The fair values recorded for these liabilities are based on valuation models that utilize various inputs and assumptions that we believe are used by market participants. We further believe that fair values based on
such models are inherently subjective and the values in an actual transaction may differ significantly from the model values. Changes in the assumptions utilized within the valuation models may have a significant effect on recorded fair values and
periodic earnings.  Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements.  Forward-Looking Statements 
Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press
releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the
“Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,”
“plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or
prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are
subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have
no specific intention to update these statements.  Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or
forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not
limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or
cyber attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations, changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal
income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the “Market Risk
Disclosures” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of June 30, 2017, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Item 4. Controls
and Procedures  As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President
(Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the
Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company
(including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting or in other
factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting.  Part II Other Information
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of
business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not
believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may
assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
Item 1A. Risk Factors 
Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2016 to which reference is made herein.  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use
of Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities  Berkshire’s Board of Directors (“Berkshire’s
Board”) has approved a common stock repurchase program under which Berkshire may repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. Berkshire may repurchase shares in
the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Berkshire’s Board authorization does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of
Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $20 billion. The repurchase program is expected to continue indefinitely and the amount of repurchases will depend entirely upon the level of cash
available, the attractiveness of investment and business opportunities either at hand or on the horizon, and the degree of discount of the market price relative to management’s estimate of intrinsic value. The repurchase program does not
obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. There were no share repurchases under the program in the first six months of 2017. 
Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
None 
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
Information regarding the Company’s mine safety violations and other legal matters disclosed in accordance with
Section 
1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act is included in Exhibit 95 to this Form 10-Q.  Item 5.
