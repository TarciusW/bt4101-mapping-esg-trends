Board statement 

 

We reaffirm our commitment to sustainability with the publication of our sustainability report (“Report”) 

guided by the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core option. For this Report, we provide 

insights into the way we do business, while highlighting our environmental, social, governance factors, 

economic performance and customer experience (collectively as “Sustainability Factors”). 

 

Whilst mindful of our profit-oriented objective, we are committed to strike a balance between growth, profit, 

governance, environment, the development of our people and well-being of our communities to secure the 

long-term future of our Group. This commitment is reflected in our sustainable business strategy and the 

material Sustainability Factors which are shown in this Report.  

 

A sustainability policy (“SR Policy”) covering our sustainability strategies, reporting structure, materiality 

assessment and processes in identifying and monitoring material Sustainability Factors has been 

established and serves as a point of reference in the conduct of our sustainability reporting. Under this SR 

Policy, we will continue to monitor, review and update our material Sustainability Factors from time to time, 

taking into account the feedback that we receive from our engagement with our stakeholders, 

organisational and external developments. 

 

The sustainability framework is supported by our key stakeholders, namely communities, customers, 

employees, regulators, shareholders and suppliers. We work closely with stakeholders in our value chain 

and their input drives our sustainability. An overview of our material Sustainability Factors is as follows:

A summary of our key sustainability performance in FY2021 is as follows:  

 

The global economic outlook remains challenging as a result of the global oversupply of tyres intense 

market competition and uncertainties arising from the Coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19” or 

“Pandemic”). To cushion the impact of the above developments, we deployed resources and implemented 

strategies to diversify our product offerings to adapt to the ongoing market changes. We have also taken 

steps to right-size our operations and will continue to focus on growing our sales of tyres, our proprietary 

SSW wheels, as well as truck tyres and mining tyres. In addition, we are also focusing on improving our 

sales productivity and upgrading our value-adding business segments such as Stamford Tyres Mart retail 

chain and truck centres. 

 

We believe that our pro-active business initiatives and operational track record will tide us through this 

challenging period and allow us to stay on course in our sustainability journey. We have detailed our 

responses to the impact of the Pandemic in the relevant sections of this Report.  

 

2. 

Reporting framework  

 

This Report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core 

option and Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) listing rules 711A and 711B. We 

have chosen to report using the GRI Standards: Core option as it is an internationally recognised reporting 

framework. The GRI content index can be found in the section 10.  

 

As part of our continual efforts to align our sustainability reporting with relevant market standards, we have 

mapped our sustainability efforts to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which is adopted by all 

United Nations Member States in 2015 (“UN Sustainability Agenda”). The UN Sustainability Agenda 

provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At 

its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs” or “Global Goals”), which form an urgent call 

for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. We have incorporated the 

SDGs, where appropriate, as a supporting framework to shape and guide our sustainability strategy.

Policy, practice and performance reporting 

 

7.1 

Reporting structure 

 

Our sustainability strategy is developed and directed by the senior management in consultation with the 

Board of Directors. Our Sustainability Committee, which includes senior management executives, is led by 

our Executive Director, and tasked to develop the sustainability strategy, review our material impacts, 

consider stakeholder priorities and set goals and targets, as well as collect, verify, monitor and report 

performance data for this Report.

7.2 

Sustainability reporting processes 

 

Under our SR policy, our sustainability process begins with the identification of relevant factors. Relevant 

factors are then prioritised as material factors which are then validated. The end result of this process is a 

list of material Sustainability Factors disclosed in this Report. Processes involved are as shown in the chart 

below: 

 

7.3 

Materiality assessment 

 

Under our SR Policy, each Sustainability Factor is assigned a reporting priority that determines the actions 

required as illustrated in the table below: 

Reporting priority 

Description 

Criteria 

 

High 

Factors with high reporting priority are reported on in detail. 

 

Medium 

Factors with medium reporting priority are considered for inclusion in 

the Report. If it is decided that such factors are not material, they 

may be excluded from the Report. 

 

Low 

Factors with low reporting priority may be reported to fulfil regulatory 

or other reporting requirements. They are not included in this Report 

if not material.  

 

The reporting priority is supported by a material factor matrix which considers the level of concern to 

stakeholders (“Stakeholders’ Concern”) and significance of our impacts on the economy, environment and 

society (“Business Impact”).  

 

7.4 

Performance tracking and reporting 

 

We track the progress of our material Sustainability Factors by identifying the relevant data points (i.e. the 

information source of the relevant factor) and measuring them. In addition, performance targets that are 

aligned with our strategy are set to ensure that we maintain the right course in our path to sustainability. 

We seek to constantly enhance our performance-monitoring processes and data capture systems.

We will update the material Sustainability Factors on an annual basis to reflect changes in business 

operations, environment, stakeholders’ feedback and sustainability trends. The details of each material 

Sustainability Factor are presented as follows: 

 

8.1 

Total customer satisfaction 

 

Our strategies towards customer satisfaction are as follows: 

 

Cultivate a long-term and sustainable relationship with our partners 

With firm relationships established with our strategic partners, we are able to gain access to distribute a 

diverse range of products under the major brands of Falken, Dunlop, Continental and Maxam to meet our 

Customers’ needs and requirements. In addition, our volume purchases allow us to secure competitive 

pricing which we can then offer our Customers with value-for-money products.  

 

Adopt market standards for the quality and safety of our products  

For products under our proprietary brands, they are manufactured by selected contract manufacturers 

(“CMS”) located in Asia under internationally recognised quality standards. The adoption of such standards 

supports our ability to consistently provide products that meet our Customers’ needs and expectations.  

 

For product safety and consistency in quality, refer to section 8.7 for further details. 

 

Maintain presence and proximity to our Customers  

We are one of the largest independent tyre and wheel distributors in Southeast Asia with international 

distribution network that spans Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong, India, Australia, 

South Africa and Vietnam. Our extensive network brings us close to the markets we serve and more 

importantly, to our Customers.  

 

Nurture a team of highly trained and experienced employees  

We are dependent on our highly trained and experienced professional staff to serve our Customers on the 

products we distribute. Our strategy to establish a global footprint is driven by a core regional team of 

trained and experienced professional staff.

Sustainable business performance 

 

We believe in creating long-term economic value for shareholders by rewarding shareholders with 

consistent profits and dividend payments. 

 

We are committed to provide value to various stakeholders through relevant and meaningful ways. In line 

with this commitment, value created in FY2021 is distributed as follows for a sustainable future:  

▪ 

A total of S$2.0 million (FY2020: S$0.9 million) was allocated as tax to governments, contributing to 

the development of countries; 

▪ 

Salaries to employees amounted to S$18.1 million (FY2020: S$20.4 million); 

▪ 

An aggregate amount of S$1.2 million5 (FY2020: S$2.4 million5) was paid as dividend to reward our 

shareholders for their continued support; and 

▪ 

A total of S$1.1 million was reinvested via revenue reserve to fund future growth (FY2020: S$6.4 million 

was withdrawn from revenue reserve6). 

 

Details of our economic performance can be found in the financial contents and audited financial statements 

of the Annual Report 2021. Our Annual Report 2021 is available as a downloadable PDF from our website

and complying with the Prevention of Corruption Act of Singapore.  

 

An employee handbook is in place to provide guidance to our employees on areas such as conduct in 

workplace, business conduct, confidentiality of information and conflict of interest. 

 

We have implemented a whistle blowing policy to provide a mechanism for employees to raise concerns 

through accessible confidential disclosure channels about possible improprieties in matters of financial 

reporting and others. In FY2021, no complaint on serious offences7 is reported (FY2020: none).

8.4 

Energy conservation 

 

We are committed to responsible usage of energy to preserve the environment in which we operate in. 

Our operations consume energy mainly for the following purposes:  

▪ 

Electricity for machineries used in the manufacturing of aluminium alloy wheels and equipment used 

in our offices;  

▪ 

Liquefied petroleum gas (“LPG”) for machineries used in the manufacturing of aluminium alloy wheels, 

specifically for wheel casting; and  

▪ 

Fuel for operating motor vehicles such as trucks and forklifts.  

 

We believe that a responsible usage of energy resources results in lesser carbon emissions and thus 

helps to preserve the environment. It also reduces our costs and enhances returns to shareholders. Key 

initiatives on this front are as follows:  

▪ 

In April 2019, we entered into a Solar Power Purchase Agreement with Sembcorp Solar Singapore 

to install a solar photovoltaic system at our headquarters (“Solar Power Project”). Under this 

agreement, solar panels are installed on the rooftop of our headquarters to generate electricity. The 

solar panels also help to bring down the roof surface’s temperature and cool the facility. This project 

enabled us to generate clean energy and at the same time, reduced our utility cost. During the 

Reporting Period, we generated 2,671.8 MWh8 of electricity from the installed solar panels; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

▪ 

A systematic maintenance program for operating equipment is in place to maintain energy efficiency; 

and  

▪ 

Energy consumption is regularly tracked, analysed and corrective actions are taken when unusual 

consumption patterns are observed. 

 

Key statistics on energy usage during the Reporting Period are as follows:

During the Reporting Period, LPG consumption rate increased mainly due to the increase in revenue of our 

wheel factory in Thailand (“Wheel Factory”).  

 

 

 

8  Comparative electricity generated from solar panels was not presented in FY2020 due to non-availability of 

information. We have strengthened our data collection process and included the information in FY2021. 

9 LPG is consumed mainly by our Wheel Factory.

8.5 

Waste optimisation 

 

We are committed to environmental preservation through reuse and recycling to allow us to operate in a 

sustainable environment.  

 

The main waste materials generated from our operations are the aluminium chips from wheel production. 

All aluminium chips from production are collected for outsourced recycling. During the Reporting Period, 

88% (FY2020: 89%) of the aluminium chips generated from production is recycled.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In addition, we are actively involved in recycling of used tyres through our retreading plants located in 

Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. The retreading plants serve to extend the life span of tyres, thus saving 

valuable natural resources used in the production of tyres. Whilst preserving the environment, we also 

ensure that all retreaded tyres are rigorously inspected to ensure quality and safety.

8.6 

Water conservation and wastewater treatment 

 

We recognise the importance to effectively manage water consumption as valuable water resources may 

be depleted and pollution may occur if we do not manage water consumption and wastewater treatment 

properly. Accordingly, we are committed to minimise water consumption and manage wastewater quality.  

 

Water is consumed for office use, Wheel Factory and retreading operations with a substantial amount 

consumed by the Wheel Factory. Water consumed by our Wheel Factory is used for cooling and washing 

purposes during manufacturing processes such as in cooling towers, for heat treatment quenching baths, 

casting hydraulic systems, as machining coolant, for painting pre-treatment and basic washing of wheels 

before paint application.  

 

Key statistics on water consumption and wastewater generated from our wheel manufacturing processes 

during the Reporting Period are as follows:

Water conservation measures adopted by our operations include the following: 

▪ 

Water consumption trends are regularly tracked, analysed and corrective actions are taken when 

unusual consumption patterns are observed; and 

▪ 

A systematic maintenance program is implemented for operating equipment to maintain water 

efficiency for our Wheel Factory. 

 

b. Wastewater treatment (Wheel Factory) 

Wastewater comprises coolant oil and paint sludge which are generated from the following wheel 

manufacturing processes: 

Description 

Source 

Coolant oil 

Generated from the machining process, which is a mixture of oil, coolant chemical 

and water 

Paint sludge 

Generated from the painting process, which is a mixture of water, paint chemical, 

thinner, and other particles captured by the water curtains inside the painting booths 

 

During the Reporting Period, the Wheel Factory generated 19,765 tonnes (FY2020: 16,941 tonnes) of 

wastewater.  The increase in wastewater generated is mainly due to the increase in production volume at 

our Wheel Factory. 

 

Measures taken to manage water quality include ensuring that wastewater is processed by our own water

8.8 

Employee retention 

 

The continual success of our business relies on a team of professional, skilled and experienced staff and 

managers. We are committed to employee retention through the following efforts: 

 

a. Performance based rewards  

We recognise that employees are key to sustainability and therefore aims to reward capable and dedicated 

employees. Under our performance share plan for managerial level employees, rewards in the form of 

shares are granted to key employees to align their interests with that of the Group. The share plan is subject 

to review and approval by an independent Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors.  

 

b. Systematic internal human resource processes 

Human resource processes related to employee 

retention includes: 

▪ 

An employee handbook is in place to provide 

guidance 

on 

employee 

benefits 

and 

disseminate corporate culture;  

▪ 

Employees are engaged regularly via various 

channels such as an appraisal exercise which 

allows employees to gain feedback on their 

career progress; and 

▪ 

In-house and external training courses are 

organised regularly for employees to improve 

their professional skills. For example, a 

systematic training program is in place in 

Thailand to equip sales staff with the necessary 

product and service knowledge. 

 

 

We believe that a low turnover improves the sustainability of operations and allows us to contribute 

positively to the development of social and human capital in a wider community. As at 30 April 2021, 74% 

(FY2020: 81%) of permanent employees have more than 3 years of service with us and our turnover rate10 

is 16% (FY2020: 20%). 

 

8.9 

Equality and diversity in the workplace 

 

We are committed to the goals of diversity and equal opportunity in employment by providing a work 

environment for our employees that fosters fairness, equality and respect for social and cultural diversity, 

regardless of their gender, age and educational background. The total number of full-time employees within 

the Group as at 30 April 2021 is 838 (FY2020: 847). During the Reporting Period, we have no (FY2020: 

zero) reported incident of unlawful discrimination11 against employees. 

 

On gender diversity, we view diversity on the Board level as an essential element in supporting sustainable 

development with two (FY2020: two) female Board members. The percentage of female to total permanent 

employees is 26% (FY2020: 26%) and about 38% (FY2020: 38%) of managers are females as at 30 April 

2021.  

 

On age diversity, matured workers are valued for their experience knowledge and skills. As at 30 April 2021, 

49% (FY2020: 46%) of our workforce is at least 40 years old.  

 

 

 

 

10 Turnover rate is calculated by dividing the total number of leavers by the total number of employees from entities 

covered. 

11 Unlawful discrimination refers to an incident whereby the relevant authority has commenced investigation and 

resulted in a penalty to the Company.

On diversity in educational background, we seek to create an inclusive environment for our employees 

from different educational background. The distribution of staff by educational level is as follows:

To promote equal opportunity, we have implemented various human resource measures as follows: 

▪ 

Human resource policy and employee handbook are in place to recruit and promote employees based 

on merit and competency; 

▪ 

Staff assessment is performed regularly to evaluate the performance of staff and provide staff with a 

sense of self-awareness to undertake training that will improve their skills and abilities; and 

▪ 

Staff recruitment advertisements do not state age, race, gender or religion preferences as requirement.

8.10 Safe working environment 

 

In our Group’s daily operations, the workers are required to handle heavy lifting equipment such as forklifts 

to transfer inventories. For the Wheel Factory, workers also operate in a high temperature environment 

with the use of chemicals such as paints. Given the nature of activities and operating environment, we are 

committed to maintain a safety-conscious culture amongst our employees.

The measures implemented to manage health and safety in the 

workplace environment are as follows:  

▪ 

A set of safety rules and regulations is in place; 

▪ 

A safety committee is in place and safety inspections are 

performed regularly by safety officers and reported to senior 

managers; 

▪ 

All new employees are briefed on safety procedures during 

orientation; 

▪ 

Regularly track and monitor accidents at the workplace and 

corrective action plans are established to prevent recurrences 

of the accidents; and 

▪ 

A dedicated first-aid room is maintained at the Wheel Factory to 

provide immediate and effective medical treatment to workers 

or others who sustain injuries at the location. 

 

We recorded zero (FY2020: zero) workplace fatalities during the Reporting Period and 4 (FY2020: 9) non-

fatal workplace injuries12, resulting in 27 man-days lost (FY2020: 26 man-days lost) during the Reporting 

Period. The non-fatal workplace injuries mainly relate to finger, hand, wrist and leg injuries. We will 

continuously work towards reducing both the occurrence and severity of workplace accidents. 

 

In light of the Pandemic, we have implemented the following measures to ensure the safety of our 

employees: 

▪ 

Temperature screening for employees before allowing entry into our premises; 

▪ 

Social distancing measures; 

▪ 

Disinfection of premises; 

▪ 

Provision of masks and hand sanitisers for employees and self-test kits for our Malaysia based 

employees; 

▪ 

Circulation of dos and don’ts to our Malaysia based employees periodically to raise awareness amongst 

our employees on the safety precautions to be taken during the Pandemic; 

▪ 

Split-team arrangement for our Malaysia based employees and Thailand based sales staff; and 

▪ 

Swab tests for employees at our Wheel Factory and Singapore-based employees who visit customer 

sites. 

 

  

 

 

 

12 A workplace accident is defined as one when an employee is injured in a work accident which resulted in (i) 

hospitalisation for at least 24 hours and/or (ii) medical leave of more than 3 days (regardless if the medical leave is 

consecutive)

8.11 Ongoing community engagement 

 

We recognise that the long-term success of our business is closely related to the health and prosperity of 

the communities that we operate in. Accordingly, we strive to constantly contribute to the community. During 

the Reporting Period, the following campaigns are initiated to help the community: 

 

a. Singapore Red Cross (“SRC”) 

Under an arrangement made with SRC, we have supported 

the servicing and change of tyres of 18 vehicles since August 

2018. The vehicles typically make over 12,000 life-saving trips 

a year and are deployed all over Singapore.  The estimated 

retail cost of savings for SRC is approximately SGD 15,000 

per year. We are proud to partake in the noble mission of SRC.  

 

 

 

 

 

b. Charity car wash 

We hosted this charity event in collaboration with The Serpents’ Pit (“TSP”) which comprises a group of car 

enthusiasts, CarTimes which mainly sells and rents out cars and Bifrost Auto which is a partner of our 

Singapore retail operations for accident claim processing and automotive repairs. We have also 

collaborated with volunteers from car clubs to send more than 300 food parcels to needy residents at Pasir 

Ris and Boon Lay in Singapore. These are challenging times and let us all remember to give a helping 

hand to the less fortunate and make Singapore a great place to live in!
