CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

Sustainability is an integral aspect of the Group’s operations. We are committed to delivering quality 

precision manufacturing solutions to our customers. This is only possible through proper management 

of internal and external risks to mitigate possible disruptions to the Group’s operations. We have 

established an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) manual and management framework to provide 

the architecture for managing risks within the Group.  

The Board manages potential risks in JEP through the review and approval of policies and procedures. 

The management then ensures that the identified risk is relevant to the business environment as well 

as ensuring controls or mitigating factors are in place. The Audit Committee provides independent 

oversight of the effectiveness of the risk management process. 

 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Currently, the risk management committee does not exist because the Board is responsible for managing 

risk within the Group. The Board ensures that a sound system of risk management and internal controls 

are present to safeguard shareholders’ interests and the assets of JEP. The Board also holds the authority 

to determine the nature and extent of the significant risks undertaken by JEP to achieve strategic 

business and objectives.  

The management has engaged Virtus Assure Pte Ltd (“VA”), an internal auditor, to conduct a major 

review of the Group’s operations and business to assess risks within the Group. VA conducted the risk 

assessment exercise to highlight pertinent risks in all areas of the Group’s operations. The identified 

risks will form the basis of the Group’s risk management framework and the ERM manual. 

 

ANTI-CORRUPTION AND WHISTLEBLOWING 

JEP is required to observe relevant local laws and regulations. In ensuring that all laws and regulations 

are complied with, the management has implemented corporate policies and procedures to provide clear 

instructions for all staff to abide by. The management ensures that all employees are aware of the latest 

developments in the law through training, seminars, and briefings conducted by professionals. 

The Board notes that the system of internal controls provides reasonable but not absolute assurance 

that the Group will not be affected by any event that could be reasonably foreseen.  

For continuous improvement of its systems, the ERM manual and risk management framework will 

undergo review by the Board when necessary. The ERM Framework will be reviewed and updated in the 

event of any change in regulations, country of operations, nature of the business or any events that 

could affect the Group’s operations. 

JEP has in place a whistleblowing policy that encourages employees to bring forward any actions that is 

opposed to the best interest of JEP, to the Chairman of the Audit Committee (“AC”) or the other 

members of the AC if the Chairman is not available. This is done to instil high standards of good business 

practices within JEP.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 

 

ABOUT THIS REPORT 

This report is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core Option 

as it provides a set of an extensive framework that is widely accepted as a global standard for 

sustainability reporting. This report aims to disclose our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) 

performance against the issues that are considered most material to our company’s stakeholders. This 

includes shareholders, suppliers*, customers*, regulators*, management and employees. The objective 

of preparing this report annually is to inform our stakeholders of the initiatives and strategies related to 

sustainability that we are currently embarking on. 

No external assurance has been sought for this report. However, we may seek external assurance for 

future sustainability reports as our reporting framework matures over time.  

 

REPORTING SCOPE AND BOUNDARIES 

The reporting period for the sustainability performance of our operations in Singapore is for the financial 

year 2020. All data and activities reported are with respect to the timeframe from 1 January 2020 to 31 

December 2020, unless stated otherwise. 

Since JEP’s operations primarily involve precision manufacturing, we refer to the activities and 

performance of the precision manufacturing facilities when discussing employee-related material issues. 

Environmental data disclosed within the sustainability report covers only Singapore-based operations. 

The content of this report is defined by the four reporting principles established by GRI G4 Guidelines: 

Stakeholder Inclusiveness, Sustainability Context, Materiality, and Completeness. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

* Proxies to external stakeholders were present during the stakeholder engagement and materiality assessment   

workshop.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT &amp; MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

JEP Holdings Limited recognises that stakeholders play an important strategic role in maintaining the 

company’s long-term growth. In November 2017, we engaged our key stakeholders through a 

stakeholder engagement and materiality assessment workshop to gather their concerns about the 

sustainability of the business. These key stakeholders were identified based on their ability to influence 

our performance and provide effective solutions to incorporate sustainability into our operations. Their 

concerns raised were gathered to identify the material ESG. The ESG factors were then prioritised based 

on their impact on the business and how important stakeholders considered each aspect. 

 

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

At JEP Group, we value all stakeholders and believe that maintaining strong bilateral relationships with 

stakeholders is a critical success factor for the Group sustainability. With routine engagements with 

stakeholders, we are able to identify each stakeholder key concerns and respond to their needs timely.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

JEP has policies that protect its stakeholders’ interest and enhances its shareholders’ value. We 

continuously invest in new capabilities to capture market share and facilitate growth.  

In year 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic severely impacted the aerospace industry across the globe. 

Consequently, the Company was also affected by the pandemic as its aerospace segment contributed 

more than 50% of the total revenue in the past years. With relentless support and hard work from our 

team members, directives of board of directors in streamlining the Group’s operations, resource 

rationalization and revenue stream diversifications, the Group managed to mitigate the impact of the 

pandemic impact in year 2020, albeit the Company not achieving its target of 5% growth on an economic 

value retained. For the year ended 31 December 2020, we have achieved a revenue of S$74.7 million 

(2019: S$89.9 million).  

Covid-19 pandemic shockwaves continues to reverberate across the global economy particularly the 

aerospace industry. Recovery to pre-pandemic level is not likely to happen any time soon due to the 

emergence of new covid-19 variants and, a high and recurring infection cases which had caused many 

countries to tighten and reinforce their control measures. As such, the Company will pivot its resources 

to more promising business unit; equipment manufacturing segment and aim to achieve a positive 

growth on an economic value retained in year 2021.

ENERGY CONSUMPTION 

Here at JEP, we utilise a wide variety of precision engineering instruments and machinery to deliver the 

best quality that a precision engineering manufacturer can offer. These instruments and machinery 

contribute to the majority of our energy consumption. We recognise the importance of properly 

managing and regulating our energy consumption so as to keep our operational costs low and help 

reduce the impact on the environment. To keep track of the energy consumption, we have a monitoring 

system in place and a maintenance team of trained individuals. 

 

In addition, we have an automated electrical supply regulation system that switches off unnecessary 

appliances and air-conditioning during lunch hours and after office hours. This system enables further 

reduction in energy consumption within our organisation.    

 

The monitoring of our energy consumption is reviewed daily by our maintenance team. At the end of 

each month, the team will analyse the monthly energy consumption. Energy surges that were identified 

within different operational areas will be investigated for possible faults in the instruments 

and machinery. If necessary, repairs will be carried out should any faults be discovered. With these 

practices in place, we aim to lower energy consumption and improve efficiency in our energy usage. 

 

In 2020, the total energy consumption accounted to 6,473,553 kWh (2019: 7,910,092 kWh), a 18% 

declined compared to year 2019 while Kwh/Revenue was at S$0.88.  

 

 

The method used to calculate energy consumption is based on the compiled electricity bill taken for the reporting 

year.

CARING FOR OUR PEOPLE 

We believe that building people within the organisation is crucial to building our business. At JEP, we 

consider people as the backbone holding up our business and strive to ensure that our employees are 

always taken care of.  

The overall responsibility of planning and conduct of Occupational Health and Safety (“OHS”) in JEP lies 

with the top management and Worksite Safety Management (“WSM”) committee, which comprises of 

representatives from all departments.  

We have established an OHS policy that has been developed to safeguard our employees. The policy 

has provided JEP a systematic way of reporting any incidents of injury or accident in our properties. At 

the same time, we advocate our corporate safety culture through multiple communications channels to 

all our employees. This includes compulsory training and courses, which include: 

 

 

 

 

 

In the event of incidents, we have on-site response plan that gives the plant manager overall 

responsibility in the treatment and evacuation of any injured workers. The human resource department 

will be informed to follow up with documentation and handling of insurance claims. 

In response to Covid-19, the Group has formed a response team to observe the latest development, 

regulations and guidelines issued by the relevant authorities. The response team members would make 

an appropriate recommendation and advice to management whenever new updates are issued by 

relevant authorities. The management has been giving full support to the team to carry out and 

implement the necessary control measures within the premises. To safeguard our stakeholders’ safety 

and ensure our business continuity; our responses team have been carrying out some control measures
