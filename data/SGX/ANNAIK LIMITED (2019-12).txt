2019 Sustainability Report

AnnAik believes sustainability is important for business as it believes that most successful companies in the world today do not just 

embrace sustainability as a supporting function but ensure that it is integrated into every function of their operations. We pursue our 

business goals and drive our sustainability initiatives forward so as to balance economic prosperity with Corporate Social Responsibility 

together.

Sustainability Report 2019 (“Sustainability Report”) is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards. This 

Sustainability Report focuses on environmental, social and governance factors that have been carefully selected to be material factors, 

given the Group’s key stakeholders.

The Board of Directors of AnnAik Limited (the “Board”) has considered sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation, determined 

the material ESG factors and overseen the management and monitoring of the material ESG factors.

2019 Sustainability Report

Board Statement


Ann Aik Pte Ltd (Registration no: 197702066M) was incorporated in Singapore on 24 September 1977 and commenced operations as a 

stockist and distributor of general hardware products with a staff size of three in a rented shop house.

In the early 1980s, Ann Aik Pte Ltd made a strategic move to specialise in the sale and distribution of stainless steel products due to less 

competition and higher profit margin. In 1989, the Company was appointed as an exclusive distributor of stainless steel butt-weld pipe 

fittings by a Japanese manufacturer. The Company also distributes and sells other stainless steel piping products, such as pipes, flanges, 

valves and fittings. Currently, the Company has approximately 10,000 different items stored in its Singapore warehouse to enable it to 

be one-stop supply centre for customers sourcing for stainless steel piping products.

On 4 September 2003, Ann Aik Pte Ltd was listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange and changed its name to AnnAik Limited. The 

successful listing of the Company’s shares marks a significant milestone in its corporate history.

Over the years, the Company has been strengthening its business and in early 2000s, it expanded upstream into manufacturing of steel 

forged flanges in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). Today, the Company has one plant in Malaysia which manufactures stainless 

steel and carbon steel forged flanges.

The Company has also ventured into the environmental business in 2005 by securing contracts to build wastewater treatment plants 

in the PRC. Today, the Company has eight wastewater treatment plants in the PRC under Build-Own-Transfer (“BOT”) or Build-Own-

Operate (“BOO”) concept. In 2010, the Company set up an environmental technology and engineering company in Singapore to 

undertake consulting services in water resource management for governmental and commercial operators. In 2015, the Company also 

ventured into the construction and supply of rural wastewater treatment equipment in the PRC to further enhance its environmental 

and engineering division.

Our Vision


Our major suppliers are the manufacturers of our Stainless 

Steel Distribution Business. Our suppliers are selected based 

on, amongst others, experience, expertise, product quality 

and past performances. We have a Procurement Policy and 

ISO standard in place which provides procurement guidelines 

such as selection and evaluation of suppliers as well as 

ensuring adequate diversification of suppliers which results in 

cost-effectiveness and prevention of operational disruptions.

We generally do not enter into long term exclusive agreements 

with any of our suppliers as we value the flexibility to evaluate 

and select our suppliers in accordance with our aforementioned 

criteria.

Our Directors believe that our business and profitability are not 

materially dependent on any industrial, commercial or financial 

contract with any supplier and will not be materially affected by 

the loss of any single supplier.



Governance Structure

Sustainability Governance is led by the Board of Directors and supported by all levels of the Group. Sustainability is a journey. The Board, 

with the assistance of Audit Committee, will ensure that we have the right policies and practices in place, with appropriate targets and 

measurements developed, and sufficient resources dedicated to sustainability-related initiatives. We will progressively strengthen the 

sustainability governance structure so that there is clear accountability and oversight

Supply Chain Management


The Group ensures that a rigorous procedure is in place to adequately and effectively manage risks faced by its business divisions during 

the course of daily operations and long-term business planning. This is done by holding regular Senior Management meetings on a 

regular basis and including Board of Directors as required.

On a quarterly basis, the Senior Management will provide updates to the Board in areas of concern, if any, that may arise in relation to 

the Group’s key risks factors.

In addition, the Group has also requested its internal auditors, to take such risk factors into consideration when drawing up the annual 

internal audit plan, so as to review and monitor the identified risk areas. In the event that the Group intends to enter into any new 

markets, business venture or business sector, the Group may also appoint external professional parties to review or advise on additional 

areas of risk factors to consider in connection with such forays.

In order to ensure that it stays current and in compliance with applicable and relevant law and standards and/or requirements issued by 

regulators, the Group tracks regulatory developments on a regular basis.

The Group’s Company Secretary, Corporate Lawyer and Sponsor advises the Board on changes in legal and regulatory issues while its 

external auditors provide changes in accounting standards to management for their consideration. The Group has engaged its external 

auditors to conduct at least one briefing per annum for the Board on changes in accounting standards.

To better manage compliance risk oversight, the Audit Committee has requested its internal auditors to assist the management in 

evaluating and assessing the effectiveness of internal controls implemented by the Company to identify risks of non- compliance in 

various areas. As part of its human resource practices, the Group ensures employee benefits are in place and healthcare insurance is 

taken out for eligible employees.

Overall compensation and benefits structure also follows closely to the basic requirements at the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”), and 

the Group keeps itself abreast through regular updates from MOM.

Whistle Blowing Policy

The Company has implemented relevant procedures, as approved by the Audit Committee and adopted by the Board, for the purposes 

of handling complaints, concerns or issues relating to activities or affairs of the business, customers, suppliers, partners or associates, 

activities or affairs of the Group or conduct of any employee, officer or management of the Group. Staff of the Group has access to the 

Audit Committee Chairman and may, in confidence and on an anonymous basis, raise concerns about possible improprieties in any 

such corporate matters by sending an email or a letter in writing to the Audit Committee Chairman.

Risk Management


Operational risks are managed on an ongoing basis. As the Group’s business is generally space-intensive by nature, the Group’s supply 

chain management is handled by the adequate sourcing of accredited suppliers as well as regular and effective management planning 

of its inventory stock and costs.

As part of its human resource efforts to add quality people to its workforce and retain its valued employees, the Group has implemented 

training and developed rigorous health and safety management programmes. The Group also provides highly incentivised working 

benefits which include insurance, medical and dental coverage.

The Group also has a robust sales, marketing and communication strategy in place to ensure its message to stakeholders are aligned 

and it delivers on its sales targets. To achieve this, it has a sales strategy based on regular management review and communication with 

customers.

The Group monitors customer satisfaction upon conclusion of projects. The Group actively seeks to reduce its operational impact on 

the environment, and has stringent corporate responsibility and sustainability practices to manage its industrial waste by recycling and 

reusing where possible and engaging licensed waste collectors. To safeguard its legal interests, the Group hires professionals such as 

lawyers to provide professional advice in relation to operational risks.

For continuous operations, the Group’s IT infrastructure is handled by IT professionals to ensure system reliability compliant with 

stringent security measures to prevent information leaks or losses. In addition, the Group’s inventories are protected by adequate 

insurance covering all industrial risks in addition to its utilisation of on-site security device.

AnnAik Limited 

2019 Sustainability Report

Operational Risk


To mitigate its liquidity risks, the Group employs a tight capital management system to ensure it has sufficient working capital to meet 

debt obligations and pays close attention to critical financial ratios such as inventory turnover, accounts receivable/payable, gearing 

and current ratio for the early detection of red flags. Information on the Group’s key performance Indicators and ratios are reported 

quarterly to the Board.

To remain resilient amidst changing and increasingly diverse customer demands and an uncertain global economy, the Group constantly 

keeps itself abreast of market conditions, and stays close to its customers through regular visits and tracking of their purchasing patterns. 

This is to ensure right stock inventories are kept and is relevant to its existing and potential customers.

The Group also has a stringent credit policy that covers credit evaluation, approval and monitoring, as a safeguard to minimise all 

credit risks. In anticipation of unforeseen financial losses, the Group adopts hedging policies and is insured in relation to the following: 

workmen compensation; product liability; directors and executive officers’ liability; industrial risks; marine insurance; vehicles insurance; 

as well as travel, health and personal accidents insurance for the Group.

Stakeholder Engagement


The Board is satisfied with management approach towards identification and prioritisation of material topics and has provided resources 

to manage the governance of sustainability.

We conducted a high-level benchmarking exercise on a universe of topics to shortlist the key topics where our company created 

significant economic, environmental and social impacts. We took into consideration the material topics and future challenges of our 

industry as identified by our peers and competitors. This include relevant laws, regulations and international agreements of strategic 

significance to our Group.

Our material issues are identified based on the significance of economic, environmental, social impacts and the degree of influence 

they have on stakeholder assessments and decisions. We develop our material topics through stakeholder feedback, new trends in 

sustainability, challenges facing the industries, experts’ views and our own business goals. We therefore focus our sustainability efforts 

and reporting on these issues.

The Group will implement and formulate quantitative a targets on each of the identified factors in phases.
