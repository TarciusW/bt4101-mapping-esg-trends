Board Statement

Unprecedented challenges and difficulties rocked the world in 2020. The outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic 

(“COVID-19”) across the world has inflicted sufferings to people of all walks of life, and it has had a great impact on businesses.

Under the “new normal” during the pandemic, sustainable development has assumed more importance to enterprises. By 

embedding sustainability into the business, Combine Will has maintained its strong momentum in times of crisis. We continue 

to thrive, create and deliver value to all our stakeholders. Our Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for overseeing 

sustainability issues, including the identification and evaluation of key sustainability topics.

On the road to sustainability, our employees are the key drivers of our continued growth. We have made significant reforms 

in people management to drive engagement and skills to support sustainable business today and in the future. For example, 

new reward programs have been introduced for employees. Looking ahead, we are looking at ways to improve working 

conditions for our employees, such as improving work schedules.

We have always adhered to operational standards and are committed to building trust with business partners and providing 

customers with high-quality products and services. In response to the pandemic outbreak, the Group quickly adjusted its 

strategy and set up an “Epidemic Prevention Team to ensure operational efficiency and safety of employees.

In addition to the on-going pandemic challenge, the risks arising from climate change should not be overlooked. In 2020, 

governments in various countries and regions promoted low-carbon transitions and announced carbon neutral targets. 

For example, China aims to ensure carbon emissions peak by 2030 and be carbon neutral by 2060. As an industrial player, 

we strive to play our part in achieving a carbon-neutral future. We strive to contribute to environmental protection and 

combating climate change by effectively utilizing our resources and implementing measures related to waste disposal and 

carbon reduction in its daily operations. In 2020, we implemented more measures to control volatile organic compounds 

(“VOCs”) emissions. In the future, we will also explore alternatives to other raw materials, such as biodegradable plastics.

Although pandemics hinder the operation of communities and even break the ties among people, we have been committed 

to protecting the health and safety of our employees and customers, and we work hand in hand with all to fight against 

pandemics and make a positive impact on society by donating supplies and engaging in different volunteer programs.

As we enter the new year, we remain hopeful in the face of unknown challenges – when others see crisis, we see opportunity. 

By embedding sustainability in our operations and connecting with all stakeholders, we are confident that it will keep us 

ahead and prosperous in the future.

Sustainability Governance

Robust governance is essential to building a resilient and successful organization in which sustainability is embedded at all 

levels. We engage openly and transparently with stakeholders across the value chain through our governance processes to 

create an inclusive and fair business. Strong policies, standards, and management systems guide our operations to address

The Board, which is the highest governance body, oversees the management of the Group’s sustainability issues and is 

supported by the Executive Management Committee (“EMC”). It assists the Board in providing strategic direction, specifically 

in terms of integrating sustainability into the Group’s strategy. The EMC leads the different operational and supporting 

departments to develop and implement sustainability-related strategies, policies and goals, including, operation departments, 

the Group’s CSR departments and Executive Directors from Group Risk/Crisis Management. The CSR Department monitors 

the performance at the factory level to elevate the effectiveness of the policies and measures.

Sustainability Risk Management

The key to a company’s success depends on its ability to anticipate potential risks and future challenges and subsequently turn 

them into opportunities. The Board oversees internal controls and risk management systems through the Audit Committee. 

In line with the Group’s CSR management system, the Executive Management Committee is responsible for the Group’s risk 

management system, which is supported by the Group’s Risk and Crisis Management Department. Internal control policies 

and procedures and derives measures to prevent and mitigate risks material to the Group’s operation. Our risk management 

process consists of 3 steps, which are identification, assessment and response. A comprehensive risk assessment will be 

conducted at least once a year. If necessary, we will conduct a topic-specific risk assessment for emergencies. The results of 

the assessment will be communicated to our senior management and relevant employees.

The Group works closely with external professional consultants to assess the risks that could affect the markets, society and 

environment in which it operates to keep abreast of the latest sustainability trends and related risks. This process identified 

the sustainability issues to be managed, of which the following are most relevant to the Group.




COMBINE WILL INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED

Sustainability Risk

Description and Impact

Measure or Response

Product Responsibility

The Group produces a wide variety of 

products, all of which must adhere to strict 

requirements and standards of its customers 

that demand a high level of product quality 

and responsibility.

This exposes us to the risk of failing to meet 

or being perceived as failing to meet the 

requirements and standards, which could 

lead to compromised product quality, brand 

reputation damage and loss of customers.

The Group has established procedures to 

identify and tackle non-conforming products. 

Examples of preventive and corrective actions 

include product correction and verification, 

process optimization and employee training.

The Group’s supplier management 

guidelines outline the social and 

environmental responsibilities of suppliers. 

Suppliers are regularly evaluated through 

internal and third-party assessments.

Socially Responsible 

Conduct

The Group’s brand and reputation are valuable 

assets, and the way we do business, our 

contribution to society and our engagement 

with the surrounding community are always 

subject to internal and external scrutiny.

This exposes us to the risk of 

misconduct relating to business ethics, 

employment-related misconduct (such as 

discrimination, harassment, child labour, 

forced labour, or non-compliance with 

employment laws), which could lead to 

brand reputation damage, talent drain, 

sanctions and litigation claims.

The Group’s CSR Guidelines govern the 

behaviour of our employees, suppliers, 

distributors and other third parties who 

work with us. The Group also established a 

sustainability governance structure to oversee 

sustainability matters. The Group will continue 

to observe social norms and the laws and 

regulations applicable to the contexts in 

which it operates.

Climate Change

Greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions lead to 

climate change that may impact our business 

in various ways. Such GHG emissions occur 

across our manufacturing facilities. Climate 

change leads to an increased frequency of 

extreme weather (floods and extremely hot 

days). Governments may take action to reduce 

climate change by introducing stringent 

regulatory requirements.

This exposes us to the risks of disruption 

to our manufacturing and distribution 

network and failure to comply with 

statutory requirements, which would lead to 

reputation or investor confidence damage, 

employee fatigue and reduced productivity.

The Group implemented environmental 

management systems in its manufacturing 

facilities to manage the environmental 

impacts that will lead to GHG emissions, 

including resource consumption and waste 

disposal. To reduce energy consumption, 

the Group has invested in energy-efficient 

technologies. The Group may also benefit 

from opportunities arising in its operating 

regions, such as by capitalizing on policy 

incentives for energy efficiency and 

renewable energy.

Materiality

To demonstrate the oversight of the Board on sustainability issues, Combine Will continues to engage an external consultant 

to interview with its top management to identify and validate the material topics. The result of the interview was combined 

with the materiality assessment outcome in the previous year7. 15 topics were identified as material for 2020, of which 

Emissions and Response to COVID-19 are newly included. In the future, the Group will enhance the stakeholder engagement 

process by reinstating a formal online survey to gather the views of various stakeholders.

List of Material Topics and Corresponding Boundaries and Impacts

The table below summarizes the reporting boundaries and impacts for each of the sustainability topics covered in this report. 

It also implies that these topics are of interest to the corresponding stakeholders. All topics within the Group are material,

Management Approach

Salary and Remuneration

The Group offers an attractive package to retain talent. Each operation is allowed to 

adjust the salary range that reflects the work conditions and individual employee’s 

effort. In 2020, the Group reviewed and redesigned its salary structure to ensure 

its competitiveness on the market. The Group also offers a range of paid-leave 

entitlements, enabling its employees to balance their professional lives, family 

commitments and leisure time.

of the needs of our employees while enabling them to acquire the information

In FY 2020, the Group has made some significant moves in people management. Key highlights are as follows.

• 

Create a comfortable workplace

To improve the working place environment, the Group developed a “care program” for our staff. We provide couches 

and blankets at designated locations in the workplace for all staff to take a nap after lunch, particularly for those who 

do not live in the dormitory.

• 

New blood for the management team

With the rapid changes in the business environment, the Group has adjusted its key recruitment plans. Besides 

promoting our existing staff, we have recruited more than 10 people for our management team, with average ages 

of 40, with multinational working experiences and appealing academic backgrounds. New hires cover a variety of 

disciplines, including information technology, automation and robotics, sustainability and wellbeing, production 

efficiency, quality management, communication and training, paper engineering and lean manufacturing.

Occupational Health and Safety

The health and safety of our employees are our top priority. Our employees deserve a workspace that supports their health 

and safety. Our efforts are designed to avoid near misses and prevent injuries, especially potentially serious and life-changing 

safety incidents.

As stated in its CSR Guidelines, the Group expects all manufacturing facilities to implement effective occupational health and 

safety (“OHS”) management systems, assess potential health and safety risks, take necessary measures to reduce related risks, 

arrange regular OHS training and related activities; and properly handle public health and infectious disease issues, such as 

developing relevant measures to cope with outbreaks of infectious diseases.

OHS Management Systems

OHS management systems have been implemented and covers all employees in all manufacturing facilities, two14 

of which are certified with ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety Management systems. It covers the 

manufacturing of plastic toys and plastic electric toys, plastic alloy toys and hygiene products. Each manufacturing 

facility has established an Environmental Health and Safety Committee (“EHS”) that brings together representatives 

from different departments through the regular meeting to discuss related matters.

As of FY2020, all employees from all manufacturing facilities were represented by joint management-worker health 

and safety committees.

• 

Hazard identification, risk assessment, and incident investigation

Based on its OHS management system, the Group has developed processes to identify hazards, assess risks and 

investigate the incident. EHS Committees, supported by safety officers, in manufacturing sites oversee the hazard 

identification and risks assessment. Department heads are responsible for identifying the hazards and assessing the 

related risks for the EHS Committees to review. The results of the risk assessment will be used to identify hazardous 

job types to develop job-specific safety requirements and age limits. The OHS system is subject to regular internal or 

external verification to ensure the quality of the process.

If an employee makes a complaint or report about malpractice, the Group protects the identity and information of the 

whistleblower so that they are protected against reprisals.

To ensure that employees are properly informed about potential work hazards, their rights and obligations, the Group 

will fully communicate with them prior to their commencement of employment. If the employee agrees, he or she 

will be required to sign an agreement before discharging his or her duties.

In the event of any OHS-related incidents, EHS Committees and safety officers are responsible for conducting an 

investigation based on the established procedures.

• 

Occupational health services

The Group provides employees with health insurance, which covers medical expenses. The manufacturing sites in 

both China and Indonesia are adequately staffed with qualified first aiders who have undergone intensive first aid 

training. CWII has an in-house medical clinic. DGLZ, HYLR and GXCW are strategically located near the hospital and 

are supported by an emergency response team.

 Worker participation, consultation, and communication on occupational health and 

safety

Under the OHS management systems, EHS committees established in each manufacturing facility involve senior 

management and employees from different departments and production lines to work together to implement and 

evaluate and an OHS management system. OHS-related information is proactively communicated among employee’ 

through EHS Committees meetings and in employee orientation training.

• 

Worker training on occupational health and safety

The Group provides various health and safety-related training for its employees. To complement its management 

training, the Group provides emergency response training such as firefighting and first aid to enable better preparation 

and response to emergencies.

Work-related injuries and work-related ill-health

During this reporting year, there were no fatalities by work-related injuries and work-related ill-health. Work-related injuries 

mostly happened during regular work activities and were usually caused by squashing, strain, scratches, and machinery. The 

safety performance is illustrated in the table below. The EHS Committees conducted incident investigations based on the 

internal procedures and handled these cases in compliance with health and safety regulations and standards. To reduce 

incidents from happening again, the Group has strengthened the safety training and has ensured that employees wear the 

personal protective equipment (“PPE”) properly.

Work-related hazards that pose risks of ill health include exposure to dust and hazardous chemicals in cutting and painting 

processes and noise from the shredding process. To protect its employees from exposure to risks of ill health, the Group 

provides them with PPE and regular medical examinations.

Diversity and Inclusion

The benefits of promoting fair employment with non-discrimination, diversity and equal opportunity are clear to our business 

leaders and are directly connected to our sustained commitment to serving our employees and customers. An inclusive and 

diverse workforce not only results in more talented workers but also provides more equality and promotes social stability 

and economic growth.

To create a fair, diverse and discrimination-free workplace, the Group’s CSR Guideline sets out its commitments. The Group 

adheres to three key principles in the recruitment process: the principle of non-discrimination, the principle of equal 

competition, and the principle of internal priority.

All employees are treated equally and with respect, through effective policies and management and with established 

grievance procedures and mechanisms to handle complaints of discrimination and harassment. Specific employees are 

identified and assigned to resolve any arising disputes and conflicts.

Rate of fatalities by work-related injury = (Number of fatalities by work-related injury/Total no. of working hours) x 1,000,000




Sustainability Report 2020

21

To foster equal opportunities, we strive to provide fair employment 

regardless of an employee’s gender, race, religion and other factors, as 

well as employment without discrimination. In addition, all employees 

are evaluated and rewarded based on their skills and performance.

The Group has established a communication platform to strengthen 

its internal controls, through which employees can report suspected 

malpractice or mistreatment related to discrimination. The whistle-blower 

may choose to file an anonymous complaint against supervisors, employee 

representatives, EHS Committees, Corporate Responsibility Unit, Executive 

Managers or General Managers.

The Group abides by laws and regulations related to discrimination. As of 31 December 2020, there were no cases of non-

compliance concerning equal opportunity, diversity, discrimination or harassment.

Labour/Management Relations

The inclusion of employees in the decision-making process is a critical factor in companies. This step can foster a trusting 

relationship between employers and employees and strengthen employee identification with the company in this way.

The Group builds mutual trust and healthy relationships with its employees through effective personnel management systems 

and policies, which are managed by the Group’s Human Resources Department.

The Group supports and respects the rights of its employees to freedom of assembly and association. The Group will not 

prevent employees from participating in and organizing trade unions and employee representative meetings based on their 

age, gender, gender orientation, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, disability, education level, etc. In 2020, around 1,400 

employees were registered members of a trade union.

The Group is committed to protecting the status of its employees and their legal rights and interests. The Group encourages 

and supports employees to elect their representatives and labour union committee members, thus building a bridge between 

employees and management so that their views can be fully reflected. Employees are allowed to democratically elect 

representatives of Trade Union once every three years.

Employee Engagement

Monthly meetings between management and trade union representatives are organized to ensure that meaningful and 

timely consultation takes place before decisions are made. In addition to regular employee representative meetings, the 

Group communicates with employees through various channels, such as “Comment Box” and employee satisfaction surveys.

Managing Environmental Footprint

Combine Will strongly believes in leading by example and implementing environmental best practices to meet stakeholders’ 

increasing expectations around sustainability. By mitigating against our potential impacts on climate and the environment, 

we are meeting our responsibilities and helping to preserve the natural resources that we depend on.

The Group is committed to minimizing the environmental burden of our operations, targeting reductions year-on-year by 

managing and monitoring our performance, and reporting on the environmental impacts that we measure. We believe 

in exceeding our statutory obligations where possible and in working with local regulators to achieve that goal. We are 

committed to strengthening our policies and management approaches to environmental protection, including energy 

management, emissions control and waste management.

Environmental considerations are integrated into different areas of our business through environmental and energy 

management systems that conform to international standards such as the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System. 

We believe these systems create a robust framework for managing our environmental and energy performance.

Energy Efficiency

Energy management is a key focus of our efforts towards continuous improvement. Energy consumption is one of the material 

environmental topics of the Group’s operations and also reflects an operational cost. Moreover, it represents a major source 

of carbon emissions. The Group is committed to utilizing resources and energy and finding feasible ways and measures to 

reduce emissions in our operations. Our manufacturing sites have implemented the “Energy Saving Control Procedure” in 

accordance with the environmental management system.

To oversee energy management, the administration department is responsible for the management of resources and energy 

and education. The repairing and other departments are responsible for the management and maintenance of related 

equipment.

Meanwhile, a set of standard procedures has been implemented to set targets and indicators to monitor the Group’s energy 

consumption and to subsequently make changes for improvement.

Emissions Control

The main air emissions arising from our activities include volatile organic carbon (“VOCs”). VOCs emissions may arise from 

various manufacturing activities, including but not limited to hand-painting, electrostatic spraying and pad printing. We have 

established control procedures based on the environmental management system.

To control VOC emissions, we have implemented the following measures:

• 

Invest in modern abatement technologies such as filtering systems, activated carbon adsorption, water pool filtration.

• 

Install real-time VOCs monitoring systems to track emissions levels.

• 

Switch to water-based paints to replace solvent-based paints.

Waste Management

Combine Will believes in supporting the principles of a circular economy and using our abilities to deliver solutions for 

process efficiency. We view waste as a potential material that can begin a new cycle of production, and we are constantly 

striving to improve waste management across our value chain. Guided by the Group’s Environmental Management System, 

the Group has implemented a set of Waste Management Control Procedures to ensure that any waste produced is handled 

appropriately. The Group complies with laws and regulations related to environmental aspects. In the reporting year, there 

were no cases of non-compliance concerning significant spills, water bodies affected by water discharge, discharge to land, 

or the generation of hazardous and non-hazardous waste.

Technical support groups such as research and development 

teams have been actively seeking creative ways to promote 

sustainable consumption while the Purchasing Department 

has been sourcing for more sustainable raw material 

substitutes.

Combine Will strives to divert waste from landfills to recycling 

facilities. In general, waste is classified and segregated at its 

source. Three major types of waste-namely general waste, 

non-hazardous solid waste and hazardous waste-are collected 

and transferred to different locations for handling. General waste is sent to a dumpsite, which will be further handled by the 

local authorities. Non-hazardous solid waste includes relatively less dangerous items that could be recycled or reused. It is 

sent to a warehouse where a licensed recycler will be contacted for waste collection. Meanwhile, hazardous waste is stored 

at a dangerous goods warehouse. To prevent environmental pollution, EHS committees regularly liaise with licensed waste 

recyclers to ensures that waste is disposed of appropriately and is not exported to other nations or regions.

Responding to COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic is posing many challenges to a wide variety of companies, especially manufacturers that depend 

on workers whose jobs cannot be carried out remotely.

The safety and well being of its stakeholders is a key priority for Combine Will. The Group is finding ways to safeguard the 

health and safety of its employees and to keep its operations uninterrupted. The Group is taking all necessary precautionary 

measures under the guidelines from the World Health Organization and public health authorities of the countries in which 

it operates. The Group immediately established COVID-19 Epidemic Control Teams led by the Executive Director. A series of 

policies and procedures were deployed.

When our employees were able to work in the office, we ensured safeguards were put in place to deliver a safe working 

environment. This included temperature checks, frequent cleaning and disinfection, access control to visitors and social 

distancing. All activities involving a gathering of people have been suspended. Where feasible, we conduct work sessions 

and customer communication online to reduce the chance of infection.

The Group has also developed an incident management plan to handle any potential case of COVID-19 within our premises. 

All manufacturing sites have business continuity and incident management plans in place and activated a team of senior 

management to handle our pandemic response. During the reporting period, no confirmed cases were found at our 

manufacturing facilities.

During the pandemic, the Group maintains 

proactive communications with employees, 

suppliers and business partners. For example, 

we 

maintain 

contact 

with 

employee 

representatives to ascertain if employees 

have any specific concerns and to learn 

about the medical condition of employees 

who have been quarantined. Our suppliers 

and business partners can contact us as usual 

through a common communication channel.

To support our employees, our subsidiary in Indonesia provides flu and pneumonia vaccines to employees and groceries 

to their families. To maintain team spirit, we conduct small team building activities in accordance with the relevant health 

protocols.

During this COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to initiate new schemes and programs to support our employees. Key highlights 

are as follows:

• 

Technology implementation

Under the new norms, our operation relies more on technology. To improve efficiency and flexibility, the Group 

has introduced more software applications and management tools, such as implementing office software to more 

businesses, promoting video conferencing, and enabling home offices.

• 

Rewarding employees

To motivate our employees during the COVID-19 outbreak, the Group has established a set of awards for individual 

employees and teams. The Special Award for Top Performers was designed to reward outstanding performance during 

the COVID-19 outbreak. Over 50 employees from different levels were nominated to receive the awards. Besides, a 

special project bonus is set up to reward any improvements or special projects that have been made. In addition, a 

special year-end bonus is given to designated staff to recognize their performance even in the tough year of COVID-19.

Customer Data and Privacy

With advanced technology, Consumers have become increasingly connected and are constantly sharing information online. 

Protecting data and privacy is paramount to building trust with our customers. As an OEM/ODM, customer privacy involves 

the collection, use and handling of the sensitive information provided by the customer in purchasing products.

The Group is committed to acting in an appropriate manner and with the highest standards of diligence for the protection, 

processing and privacy of personal data. The Group is highly vigilant in complying with legal requirements and strictly 

adhering to customer consent for data sharing.

• 

Information Security

The Group has implemented measures to protect the physical and digital information of our customers. Designated 

personnel is responsible for keeping the product designs, drawings and information of customers. To enhance the 

security of the Group, we also implemented strict access control, and CCTV is installed in certain areas.

• 

Intellectual Property Protection

The Group has implemented intellectual Property Protection (“IPP”) Management System as part of the CSR management 

system. It consists of a mix of preventive measures, such as conducting self-assessment, auditing and analyzing non-

compliance of IPP, encouraging employees to report suspected misconduct, and establishing professional teams to 

track IPP management in its operations.

The Group expects our suppliers to respect the intellectual property as much as we do. As sat out in our CSR Guidelines, 

the Group’s suppliers are required to commit to policies and practices that promote respect for intellectual property 

rights and conventional knowledge to protect the intellectual property rights and reputation of the Group, its customers 

and stakeholders; promote investment, economic and tangible property security, and stimulate creativity and innovation.

• 

Accreditations

Our manufacturing facilities20 have participated in the Global Security Verification (“GSV”) program, which is developed 

based on Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (“C-TPAT”)21 program. The GSV Standard is a program to 

help importers as well as suppliers in assessing their security measures based on international supply-chain security 

requirements. The verification focuses on existing processes, procedures and infrastructure related to various areas, 

including but not limited to cybersecurity, physical access controls. It demonstrates our continuous efforts to protect 

our customers’ property and interests through supply chain security practices and risk management. An independent 

third-party is engaged annually to audit our management system against GSV standards to ensure its effectiveness.

Besides, CWII also participated in Supplier Compliance Audit Network (“SCAN”), which is an audit program similar to 

GSV and C-TPAT. In 2020, CWII achieved full score in SCAN.

Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (“C-TPAT”) program is a voluntary initiative designed by U.S. Customs and Border 

Protection (CBP) that focuses on the development of cooperative relationships between Customs and the business community. The

laws and regulations. The Group’ Business Ethics Management Guideline sets out the code of conduct to be adhered to by 

Directors and employees, including prevention of corruption and bribery, avoidance of conflicts of interest and unauthorized

Labour Standards

Demands for transparency on key sustainability issues, such as labour practices and modern slavery, are increasing around 

the world. The potential impact on human rights can occur anywhere in the value chain and may include issues related to 

child and forced labour.

suppliers and subcontractors) are free from child labour and modern slavery. Guided by the Group’s CSR Guidelines, the 

use of child labour and forced labour is strictly prohibited. The Group is committed to protecting human rights in line with

The Group strictly prohibits the employment of individuals below the legal working age. If local regulations do not 

prescribe a definition of “child labour”, the minimum age of employment shall be 15 years for the Group’s operations 

in Indonesia and 16 years for the Group’s operations in China. Before hiring, Human Resource conducts a thorough 

check on the identity of job applicants to avoid hiring underaged workers. If child labour is found, remedial measures 

will be taken and reported to the local authorities.

• 

Young workers

In the event of recruiting teenagers aged 16 to 18, special arrangements are made to protect the legal rights and 

physical and mental wellbeing of young workers. Young workers are strictly prohibited from performing work with 

potential safety and health hazards, including but not limited to performing heavy manual work, controlling heavy 

equipment, and working in environments exposed to hazardous substances.

•

The Group strictly prohibits any form of forced labour practices, including coercing employees to work, through the use 

of violence or intimidation or by subtle means such as unreasonable restriction on employees’ freedom of movement 

as disciplinary measures. The Group prohibits the collection of deposits during the recruitment process and does not 

withhold employees’ ID cards. Official working hours, including rest periods, overtime and compensation, that follow 

local laws are clearly defined in internal policies.

and supplier selection. The Group is actively managing its value chain on issues related to labour standards. The Group 

conducts due diligence when sourcing suppliers and requires suppliers to conduct self-assessments. In addition, the Group 

is subject to third-party audits and customer audits regularly.
