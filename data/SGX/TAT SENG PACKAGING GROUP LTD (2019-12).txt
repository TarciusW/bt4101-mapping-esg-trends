DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

As we close off 2019, we look back fondly at Tat Seng Packaging Group Ltd and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) impactful 

year of growth and our continued pursuit of sustainable development. We have come a long way since our inception 

in 1968, and today we have become a leader in the corrugated packaging industry. With this success comes a huge 

responsibility to our customers and our planet. We strongly believe that thriving businesses of the future are those that 

put in conscious effort to take care of their people and the planet, in tandem with their business goals.

Our vision for sustainable growth is simple – to provide quality products and services to our customers while minimizing 

the negative environmental impact and increasing our positive social impact.

Ever since we obtained the ISO 14001 Standard for Environment Management System in 2004, I am proud to say that 

we have been continually seeking ways to improve the way we work and manage our impact on the environment. In 

late 2017, the Singapore Plant installed new wastewater treatment equipment to treat our industrial used water and 

dispose sludge through a local licensed waste collector. This effective implementation of wastewater management has 

stopped us from discharging any trade effluent into public sewers. We are heartened by our progress in this aspect 

and will continue to strive to do better in the years to come.

CHAIRMAN’S

MESSAGE






































The Group is conscious of our responsibility in supporting our customers to move towards more sustainable patterns 

of consumption. Alongside the Singapore National Environment Agency (NEA)’s drive for packaging reporting, we have 

been stepping up our efforts in this space. We aim to work closely with NEA in collecting data on our packaging and 

in drawing up plans to reduce the amount of packaging waste. Together, we believe we can help Singapore to achieve 

its goal of becoming a Zero Waste Nation.

As we step into the next financial year, our world is also faced with the pressing challenge of the COVID-19 outbreak. 

In light of this COVID-19 pandemic, the Group will monitor the evolving situation closely, while taking all necessary 

precautionary measures to safeguard the health and safety of our employees, and complying with directives from the 

relevant local authorities. Nevertheless, corporations have a responsibility to continue to push for sustainability and 

implement the positive change that the world needs.

Our ambitions for the future are by no means small. We have big business goals to achieve, underpinned by our 

commitments to our people and planet. The Group will continue to work with our customers, employees and other 

stakeholders to support the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and focus on SDG 12 – Responsible 

Consumption and Production &amp; SDG 13 – Climate Action, where we can make the biggest contributions.

Part of the journey of growth includes learning from our stakeholders. As always, we welcome conversations on how 

we may improve our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors, via email to sr@tspg.sg.

Malaysia, Australia, Indonesia and Taiwan. Our paper roll in China mainly come from paper mills in China.

There were no significant changes to our supply chain in 2019. The Group’s policy is to continually ensure that all 

our supplies are purchased from sustainable sources. We suspend procurement from suppliers which are reported 

to have engaged in errant practices until there is reasonable assurance that the offending practice has been rectified.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY

APPROACH


SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE (102-18)

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (102-18, 103-2)

The Group is committed to setting and maintaining high standards of corporate governance as well as promoting 

corporate transparency by adhering closely to the principles and guidelines set out in the Code of Corporate Governance 

2018. One of the roles of the Board is to consider sustainability issues, such as environmental and social factors, as 

and when necessary, as part of its strategic formulation.

To ensure that specific issues are subject to considerations and review before the Board makes its decision, the 

Board has established a number of Board Committees to assist the Board in carrying out more effectively its oversight 

function. These Committees function within clear Board-approved written terms of reference. Such terms of reference 

will be reviewed by the Board and Board Committees on a regular basis to ensure their continued relevance and to 

enhance the effectiveness of these Board Committees.

The Board implemented a Board Diversity Policy in November 2019, reserving at least 10% of the total number of 

board seats for women. 22% of the Board seats are currently occupied by women.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY

APPROACH


NOMINATING BOARD MEMBERS (102-24)

To ensure oversight of nominating board members, the Board has established a Nominating Committee (“NC”). The 

NC reviews Board composition annually to ensure there is an appropriate mix of expertise and experience to enable 

Management to benefit from a diverse perspective of issues that are brought before the Board.

When a vacancy exists, the NC, in consultation with the Board, determines the selection criteria for the position based 

on the skills and knowledge deemed necessary for the Board to best carry out its responsibilities. Candidates may 

be suggested by Directors or Management or sourced from external sources. Whilst mindful of related regulatory 

requirements, the NC considers prospective Board Members based on good character, merit, competencies, expertise, 

skills, track record, background and other qualities. To promote diversity, the NC will also give due consideration to 

gender, age, ethnicity, disability and geographic representation.

The NC will then make a recommendation to the Board for the appointment. The Board then appoints the most suitable 

candidate who must stand for re-election at the next Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of shareholders.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE (102-32, 103-2)

In 2017, the Group formed a committee to promote, monitor, and report on sustainability business practices. The 

committee reports to the Board and is represented by Managing Director/CEO, Mr Loh See Moon, and Executive 

Director, Madam Cheong Poh Hua. Full profiles of our directors are available on pages 8 to 12 of our Annual Report 

FY2019.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (102-25, 103-2)

A Conflict of Interest policy and disclosure process is in place to protect the interests of the company. All disclosures 

are to be made to the HR Manager and the General Manager/Director. They will determine whether a conflict exists 

and how to proceed accordingly.

INVESTOR RELATIONS POLICY (102-33, 103-2, 103-3)

The Investor Relations Policy was updated in November 2019 to outline our modes and frequency of communication 

and affirm our compliance with relevant regulations and recommended practices designed to provide our shareholder 

community access to timely and material information. We are committed to making timely, full and accurate disclosures 

in accordance with the listing rules of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited.

prospective customers, suppliers and shareholders.

WHISTLE-BLOWING POLICY (102-17, 102-33)

2013. This policy outlines the scope, objectives, safeguards and reporting procedures for any suspected unethical or

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT (102-42, 102-43, 102-44, 102-46, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)

Carrying out a Materiality Assessment is the most important aspect of our sustainability strategy because it ensures 

we learn about the sustainability issues that concern our stakeholders and address them promptly, leading to a more 

robust and sustainable organisation.

2019’s materiality assessment process included meetings with internal stakeholders such as employees and 

management, and an online survey. There was a difference in the order of importance of some of the materiality topics.

a) Economic Issues moved from Position 5 in 2018 to Position 1 in 2019

b) Occupational Safety and Health moved from Position 6 in 2018 to Position 2 in 2019

c) Responsible Sourcing remained in Position 3

Disclosures in this report cover our Singapore and China manufacturing facilities in general. However, all topics reflected 

in the Material matrix only cover our Singapore Plant. Metrics applicable to GRI core disclosures are reported only if 

they are a good representation of the impact of our value chains.

In 2019, the total number of training hours almost doubled from 2018. The average hours of training per employee 

from 2018 also increased by 3.7 hours. This was due to further training taken up by employees who were from the 

Non-Executive or lower category.

External training was sponsored for 20+ employees. The course topics taken ranged from Facilitating Change, Software 

Development, IoT Applications in Supply Chain Management, PDPA to Strategic Leadership. After staff have attended 

training, they are encouraged to share what they have learned with their colleagues to help supervisors evaluate whether 

the same training should be rolled out to the rest of the staff in the future.

Regular performance and career development reviews are conducted twice a year. Our performance evaluation system 

provides an avenue for two-way feedback between our employees and their reporting superiors. This system allows 

us to recognise and reward employees for their contributions and motivate them toward performance improvement 

and career development. Where possible, we promote the employees who have demonstrated potential and have the 

relevant skills to fill vacant positions instead of recruiting externally. The appraisal process also actively identifies talents 

for future leadership roles on an ongoing basis.

We will continue to assist our employees in harnessing their talents for their own professional development. This, we 

recognise, will eventually benefit our organisation as well.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH &amp; SAFETY (103-2, 103-3, 403-1)

In Singapore, workplace safety and health is regulated through the Workplace Safety and Health Act and Work Injury 

Compensation Act. As occupational hazards generally exist in a manufacturing environment, we consider workplace 

safety and occupational health a priority for our employees. Our health &amp; safety guidelines highlight clear communication 

about workplace safety to eliminate hazardous incidents that may arise

Each employee is expected to observe all rules and regulations governing safety practices, use the safety equipment 

provided and practice safety at all times. Training and briefing are constantly provided at the Production level and 

communicated to new and existing employees to understand the rules and safety regulations before the start of each 

work day.

We acknowledge responsibility for the health and safety of all employees. We have the following in place:

a) 

Workplace Safety &amp; Health Committee (“WSHC”)

Includes various department supervisors who monitor, manage, and implement workplace safety practices. The 

committee meets at least once a month to develop, plan, organise, manage and improve on our workplace 

safety programs. The meeting is chaired by the committee chairman (also our Production Manager) and the 

committee secretary is a registered Workplace Safety &amp; Health Officer.

b) 

5S Committee

Organise a monthly inspection to ensure that the concept of 5S – Sort (seiri), Set in Order (seiton), Shine (seiso), 

Standardise (seiketsu) and Sustain (shisuke) – is habitually practiced, and to commend the efforts of our staff 

in maintaining a tidy, clean and safe working environment within the organisation.

INJURY &amp; OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE RATE (103-2, 103-3, 403-2)

A commitment to employee health, safety and well-being is embedded in our culture and shapes the design of our 

processes and products. We take a holistic approach, offering a wide variety of guides, training, programmes and 

benefits to promote employee health, safety and wellness. One such programme is the SATA Chest X-Ray Programme, 

ensuring treatment if any employee contracts tuberculosis. This helps in reducing incidence and risk of related diseases.

Table 9: Injury &amp; Occupational Disease Rate for Singapore Employees. Please refer to footnote1 for formula

According to Singapore Ministry of Manpower (MOM)’s Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Report 2019, the nation 

recorded 39 workplace fatality cases. In comparison, we did exceptionally well in maintaining zero losses.

ABSENTEE RATE (403-2)

Absentee means absent from work because of incapacity of any kind, not necessary as a result of work-related injury or 

disease, but excludes permitted leave absence such as holidays, examination leave, maternity leave or paternity leave 

and compassionate leave. The absentee rate is calculated as actual absentee days lost, expressed as a percentage 

of total days scheduled to be worked by the employees for the entire year.

Our absentee rate in Singapore has increased slightly from 1.7% in 2018 to 2.1% in 2019. This was correlated to the 

rise in injuries and increase in lost day rate for females. 

We continue to encourage our employees to maintain a healthy lifestyle to help keep the absentee rate low.

As the Group’s raw materials significantly comprise of paper, our management has identified that paper waste 

management and supplier assessment for environmental impact are key material aspects for the Group’s sustainable 

development.

We attained ISO 140001 Environmental Management System certification to help us guide and manage our 

environmental responsibilities. We are committed to reducing and preventing pollution to the environment, by 

implementing an effective Environmental Management System (“EMS”) and Environmental Policy. Our EMS seeks to

1. Conserve energy and recycle our waste.

2. Use Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS) Free materials in our manufacturing processes.

3. Minimize the use of depletable natural resources.

4. Minimize the generation of waste and pollutants by our manufacturing process.

5. Comply with local environmental legislation and other requirements.

6. Continuously improve the performance of the environmental management system.

Our operation team regularly reviews our production process and equipment to minimise paper wastage, reduce 

energy and waste.



Paper waste is compacted into bales at our factory premise.

PAPER (103-2, 103-3, 301-1, 306-2)

Our raw materials mainly comprise of paper harvested from wood. Whilst wood is a renewable resource, paper can 

be recycled several times.

In 2019, our factories in China and Singapore consumed 267,277 tons of paper rolls. As we offer customised solutions, 

paper waste is unavoidable. Our paper shreds are automatically collected using conveyor belts under grooves on 

our factory floor. The wastepaper is then compacted into bales and sold to a local licensed wastepaper collector. 

The collector collects the wastepaper daily (from a skip bin they have provided), consolidates them and exports the 

wastepaper to overseas paper mills for re-manufacturing into various recycled paper and paper products.

In 2019, we met the targets in our Environmental Policy to keep paper wastage under 8.6% annually.  We disposed 

22,479 tons as waste, and that is equivalent to 8.41% of our total paper consumed, of which 100% of this waste was 

recycled.

ENERGY (103-3, 302-1, 302-4)

We cultivate energy efficient practices in our operating plants and offices in Singapore. In 2019, our average electricity 

usage (kWh) per metric ton of actual paper produced per month was 90 kWh/mt – a 20% reduction from 2014. We 

attribute this to our energy conservation efforts which we have made in the last 5 years.

Our energy efficiency efforts also include:–

a) By end 2019, replaced 5% of all 150w-200w Induction High Bay lamps to 80w-100w LED lights when old bulbs 

were used up.

b) Installing skylights in Singapore operating plant to allow sunlight onto the production floor.

c) Using natural gas for fuel in Singapore plant since 2017.

d) Suzhou, Hefei and Tianjin plants in China are using steam as a source for fuel while two Nantong plants use natural 

gas for fuel.

e) Ensuring all air-conditioning units are using R410A environmental friendly refrigerant.

For 2020, we will continue to work towards improving energy efficiency across all our plants and offices.

WATER &amp; EFFLUENTS (103-2, 306-1, 306-2, 306-4)

The Group uses water during production of corrugated products, resulting in the release of industrial used water. We 

recycle the industrial used water for our manufacturing process where possible.

In Singapore, the discharge of trade effluent into the public sewers is regulated by the Public Utilities Board (PUB), 

which conduct regular checks on effluent discharge.

In late 2017, the Company was the first corrugated plant in Singapore and Asia to acquire an Evaporator system to 

treat wastewater. The Evaporator converts wastewater to vapour and the leftover sludge is disposed of by a licensed 

waste collector. Since mid-2018, we have stopped discharging industrial used water into public sewers in order to 

meet PUB’s regulations.

As part of our risk-based approach to comply with Singapore PUB’s Trade Effluent Regulations, our wastewater 

samples are regularly collected at the final discharge inspection chamber and analytically tested by an external local 

laboratory. In 2019, we have conducted wastewater analysis in March, August and November, and the test results 

are all within PUB’s Allowable Limit.

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT (301-1)

Most of our raw material is paper roll, produced from wood. In order to obtain paper, logging and deforestation are 

necessary. However, the process of logging and deforestation create long term loss to ecosystems. According to 

the World Wildlife Fund’s Climate, Nature and our 1.5° Change report, logging to produce timber and pulp for global 

markets is the main driver of forest degradation.

We recognise that the nature of our business requires us to utilise a considerable amount of paper from all over the 

world.

Consumers across the world are increasingly concerned about protecting the environment and for them, the source 

of products they purchase is important. As such, we recognise that sustainable procurement is a prerequisite for our 

long-term sustainability.

SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES (103-2, 103-3, 301-1, 301-2, 308-1)

Diagram 15: Guideline for Sustainable Procurement

We screen all our suppliers thoroughly to meet our sustainability standards. We ensure we procure paper roll mainly 

from FSC® certified suppliers. The certification system allows us to identify, purchase and use wood, paper and other 

forest products produced from well-managed forests and/or recycled materials. Adoption of the FSC® Chain of Custody 

means that the paper we use as raw material is unlikely to have been harvested illegally in violation of traditional or 

civil rights, or in a way that threatens high conservation value areas.

We also ensure we follow environmental guidelines when procuring suppliers. Furthermore, every year, we review our 

suppliers and their activities to ensure they meet our sustainability standards.

In 2019, the Company imported all the paper from FSC® Certified suppliers.
