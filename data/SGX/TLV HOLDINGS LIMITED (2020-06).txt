BOARD

ABOUT

STATEMENT

THIS REPORT

TLV Holdings Limited, together with its subsidiaries, (the “Group” or “TLV Holdings”) is pleased to present our third 

Sustainability Report from 1 April 2019 to 30 June 2020 (“FY2020”). As a Group, we are committed to continue to expand 

the business sector and create sustainable value for stakeholders through annual reporting on sustainability initiatives 

on key environmental, social and governance management outcomes. We believe by integrating sustainability concepts 

into our three core business sectors, Exhibitions, Retail and Financial Services, we would be able to stay competitive and 

deliver sustainable results to our stakeholders. 

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) recognised the vital role of sustainability in the formulation of the Group’s day to 

day operation and long-term business strategies. The Board also provides oversight for and monitors the management 

of these material environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters as well as financial performance. 

FY2020 was a year of unprecedented change and challenge with the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak in January 2020 which 

affected most businesses globally. The suspension of operations at our retail outlets in Singapore during Phase 1 of the 

Circuit Breaker period since April 2020 and the prohibitions in international travel resulted in the reduction of revenue 

in retail and exhibition sectors. With the opening of Phase 2 of the Circuit Breaker in June 2020, the Group had taken 

precautionary measures and implemented operational protocols in both the retail outlets and head office through high 

levels of infection control and rigorous screening procedures such as temperature screening and contact tracing form for 

both the employees and customers.  

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, disruptions to the Group’s sales and distribution channels are to be expected but we will 

continue to focus on building resilience through strengthening relationships with our local and overseas customers across 

our key markets so as to sustain our jewellery business.  

As we continue to report our journey, the Group remains steadfast to our sustainability initiatives and focused on building 

a resilient company amidst these fragile and challenging times.

SUPPLY CHAIN

MANAGEMENT

We are committed to act responsibly and reduce the impact of our business operation along the supply chain of products. By 

focusing on value chain sustainability, we hope to create confidence in our products and provide top quality jewellery to our 

customers. 

Our main purchases are high quality diamonds and gold, which are supplied by our approved suppliers. All our suppliers are 

critically accessed based on their expertise, quality and past performance. In our approach to sustainable and responsible 

business practices, suppliers are evaluated annually based on a set of stringent criteria by our procurement team to ensure 

that they comply with local rules and regulations, including ethical business practices. Strong links were forged with our 

suppliers over the years and we will continuously monitor our supplier’s performance to ensure that we procure from qualified 

suppliers. 

We have established formalised policies and procedures for different stages of procurement process such as selection, 

comparison and periodic evaluation of suppliers. Our pricing policy relies on the three key factors of competitive profit 

margins, bulk purchasing power and disintermediation.

In addition, we have a quality assurance system in place and with that, we have conducted random checks on our jewellery 

to ensure they are properly inspected before selling to customers.

The Covid-19 outbreak has an unprecedented impact on the global supply chain. As a Group we strive to maintain collaborative 

relationship with our suppliers and business partners to act swiftly to our shared challenges. The Group has not encountered 

any major disruption to the global diamond and gold supply chain. The Group continues to plan and replenish wisely its raw 

material inventory from suppliers in Singapore, China and Hong Kong according to its operating needs. Production and supply 

levels will remain strictly aligned with market demand and sales forecast. However keen market competition, fluctuations in 

currencies and raw material prices are expected to continue and will affect the Group’s results. 

In FY2020, we did not receive significant complaints about our products or service quality. Going forward, we endeavor to 

keep the complaints to minimal.

In FY2020, we assessed the ESG issues previously identified in FY2019 through continuous internal and external stakeholder 

engagement and conclude that they continue to be relevant to our business. The Group has adopted a four-step materiality 

assessment process as summarised below:

IDENTIFICATION

A preliminary list of ESG matters were selected after discussion and analysis 

performed by the Sustanability Committee and Board of Directors

PRIORITISATION

The identified ESG issues were ranked and prioritised based on the 

significance, economic impacts and degree of influence on our internal and 

external stakeholders

VALIDATION

Material issues that were identified in Step 2 were presented to the Board for 

validation and approval

REVIEW

Material issues that were approved by the Board will continue to be re-

assessed in subsequent reporting periods to ensure that reported topics 

remain relevant and material

MATERIAL

ASSESSMENT

Based on feedback gathered from our internal and external stakeholders, we have re-evaluated the relevance and importance 

of existing key sustainability topics. We are of the view that the existing six material sustainability topics are of relevance to 

our business and are the utmost important to the stakeholders and the Group.  

For this Sustainability Report, material ESG matters that have previously been identified: economic performance, corporate 

governance, ethics, anti-corruption and anti-bribery, energy local communities, customer privacy and employment have been 

reviewed and found to maintain their relevance for this year’s report.

ECONOMIC

PERFORMANCE

With the announcement of the circuit breaker measures in April 2020, there was a significant decline in profit as compared 

to last year. 

There was a change in financial year from 31 March 2019 to 30 June 2020 (“FY2020”) and the following comparison were 

based on 15 months comparison versus 12 months for FY2019. The Group’s revenue decreased from approximately $119.0 

million in FY2019 to approximately $114.1 million in FY2020 a decrease of approximately $4.5 million or 4%. This was mainly 

due to Covid-19 pandemic that had severely hit our retail, wholesale sector due to travel restrictions imposed which resulted 

in the cancellation of international jewellery exhibitions in various countries since February 2020. Revenue for the wholesale 

and exhibition business also declined by 15% from $57.7 million in FY2019 to $49.0 million in FY2020 which was attributable 

to lower level of sales recorded from reduced participation and attendance in international exhibitions.

Revenue for retail business increased by 4% from $59.6 million in FY2019 to $62.0 million in FY2020 due to an additional 

3 months in the 15 months period being compared. On 12 months comparison, the retail sales have declined by 2% due to 

the lower footfall in retail outlets as a result of Circuit breaker measure since April 2020. Revenue for the financial services 

business had increased by 72% from $1.8 million to $3.1 million due to higher interest income earned from the pawn broking 

and money lending business segment. Consequently, the Gross profit increased by approximately $0.2 million or 1% to $29.8 

million in FY2020. Gross margin increased from 24.8% in FY2019 to 26.1% in FY2020 due to the different product sales mix.

The Group has taken measures to reduce costs by freezing headcounts, clearing of annual leave and pay reductions for 

managerial positions. We also relied on relief measures from government support schemes which include the Temporary 

Bridging Loan, enhanced SME Working Capital Loan, Job support scheme and rental rebates from landlords. Nonetheless, the 

Group’s sentiment remains positive and will overcome the challenges ahead. 

The Group plans to transform and enhance our operation to fit into the new post Covid-19 international business practices 

via training and upskilling of our work force while embarking on the digitalisation of the company. Operational initiatives 

were rolled out to ensure business recovery and sustainability during this period. These include the Group’s efforts to tap 

on its social media platform as jewellery brands have the opportunities to broaden their marketing reach and sell directly 

to new demographic. Steps such as human resource planning, deferral of all discretionary expenses and non-critical capital 

expenditures have been undertaken to conserve cash flows.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, ETHICS, 

ANTI-CORRUPTION AND ANTI -BRIBERY 

TLV Holdings is committed to uphold high standards of 

corporate governance practice to ensure the transparency 

in its policies and process. We deem corporate governance 

as essential for the success of the Group and have zero 

tolerance towards unethical behaviour. The Group has 

adopted the revised Code of Corporate Governance 2018 

(the “2018 Code”) and practice guidance issued by the 

Monetary Authority of Singapore. The 2018 Code serves 

as a guideline for effective corporate practices and 

setting the right foundation for achieving organisation’s 

vision and mission. The Group has established policies 

and procedures on Conflict of Interest, Whistleblowing 

and Code of Business Conduct as the backbone of good 

corporate governance.

WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY 

In response to good governance, the Group adapts and 

review our whistleblowing policy regularly to ensure 

it is up to date. Through internal memorandums and 

via the Group’s internal shared drive, details of the 

whistleblowing policy are disseminated to all staffs for 

compliance. The whistleblowing policies and channels 

were made available to our employees to raise concerns 

about possible improprieties on matters such as financial 

reporting, misconduct, unlawful activities, and other 

improper activities. The Audit Committee (“AC”) will take 

appropriate disciplinary action following the completion 

of the investigation to assure that employees will be 

protected from reprisals or victimisation for whistleblowing 

in good faith and without malicious reporting.

For FY2020, there were no whistle-blowing reports 

received. Moving forward, we aim to maintain this record 

in FY2021 and continue adhering to the existing policies 

and procedures which would be conducted if there are 

any unethical conduct or malpractice identified by the AC.

ANTI – MONEY LAUNDERING POLICY 

In TLV, we strive to maintain professional value and 

integrity in our daily operation. We continue to implement 

anti-money laundering framework with the Group and 

protect the interest of our stakeholders, with that it 

allows our stakeholders to report any suspicious cash 

transactions to the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office 

of the Commercial Affairs Department of Singapore. Our 

employees will continue to abide by our Code of Corporate 

Governance, which outlines the standards of conduct and 

formal disciplinary procedures which would be conducted 

if there are any unethical conduct or malpractice identified 

by the AC. 

As part of our “Know-your client” process, we have 

consistently collected information from our new wholesales 

customers for background checks. With periodic review 

of any unusual cash transaction with new and existing 

customers, we are able to monitor and detect any unusual 

activities.  

In FY2020, there was no reported case of misconduct 

by our employees and stakeholders. Moving forward, we 

aim to maintain this record in FY2021 and continue to 

abide by the existing policies and procedures.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY

The Board has reviewed and approved the Group’s 

conflict of interest policy, to address general principles 

related to conflict of interest, guiding key management 

in identity disclose and management identified potential

of these controls requires independent audits from time

We are proud to announce that there were no incidents of 

corruption and wrongdoings being reported against our

no legal cases of corruption brought against the Group 

in the same financial year as well. We aim to maintain 

this record in FY2021 and conduct relevant training for 

our employees to increase the awareness of relevant 

channels available for their feedback and concerns.
