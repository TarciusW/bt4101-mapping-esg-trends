Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments except as otherwise noted, considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2012. Fiscal Year We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January.  Fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2012 are both 52-week years. The third quarters of fiscal years 2013 and 2012 are both 13-week quarters.Principles of Consolidation Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, warranty liabilities, litigation, investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.  Revenue RecognitionProduct Revenue We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. For most sales, we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement. We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer based on the shipping terms. At the point of sale, we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured. If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment. Our policy on sales to certain distributors, with rights of return, is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product, as the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated.  Our customer programs primarily involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets. We accrue for 100% of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor.  We recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate. Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale, unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate.  Unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue.7NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Our customer programs also include marketing development funds, or MDFs. We account for MDFs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense, depending on the nature of the program. MDFs represent monies paid to retailers, system builders, original equipment manufacturers, distributors and add-in card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. Depending on market conditions, we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered.We also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. License and Development Revenue For license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components, we generally recognize this license revenue over the period that services are performed. For most license and service arrangements, we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project. We periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate. A provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts. If the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized, the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue. Revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress. Significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours. Any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period. For license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement, we record revenue over the life of the license term, with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue.Royalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of products that use our technologies under license agreements with third parties.  We recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licensee. Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory provisions and shipping costs. We write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value. Obsolete or unmarketable inventory is completely written off based upon assumptions about future demand, future product purchase commitments, estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions.  If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, or if our current inventory or our future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products, additional future inventory write-downs may be required that could adversely affect our operating results. Inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped.  If actual market conditions are more favorable than expected and we sell products that we have previously written down, our reported gross margin would be favorably impacted.8NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)     Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2013, we adopted an amended standard that simplifies how entities test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment and also improves consistency in impairment testing requirements among long-lived asset categories. This amended standard permits an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. For assets for which this assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, the amended standard eliminates the requirement to perform quantitative impairment testing as outlined in the previously issued standard. This new standard did not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, we adopted an amended standard that increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. This amended standard eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity and requires that all changes in stockholders' equity-except investments by, and distributions to, owners-be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The adoption of this amended standard impacted the presentation of other comprehensive income, as we have elected to present two separate but consecutive statements, but did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.9NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited) Note 2 - Stock-Based Compensation We measure stock-based compensation expense at the grant date of the related equity awards, based on the fair value of the awards, and recognize the expense using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures. We estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model and use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs. We calculate the fair value of our employee stock purchase plan using the Black-Scholes model.Our consolidated statements of operations include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts capitalized as inventory, as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 28, 2012 October 30, 2011 October 28, 2012 October 30, 2011 (In thousands) (In thousands)Cost of revenue$2,489 $3,049 $7,664 $8,274Research and development20,056 19,308 60,148 59,594Sales, general and administrative10,524 10,872 33,081 33,050Total$33,069 $33,229 $100,893 $100,918During the three and nine months ended October 28, 2012, we granted approximately 3.2 million and 6.8 million stock options, with an estimated total grant-date fair value of $17.9 million and $37.2 million and a weighted average grant-date fair value of $5.54 and $5.45 per option, respectively. During the three and nine months ended October 28, 2012, we granted approximately 3.5 million and 7.5 million  RSUs, with an estimated total grant-date fair value of $48.2 million and $104.7 million and a weighted average grant-date fair value of $13.72 and $13.99 per RSU, respectively.  During the three and nine months ended October 30, 2011, we granted approximately 3.0 million and 6.3 million stock options, with an estimated total grant-date fair value of $21.8 million and $51.4 million and a weighted average grant-date fair value of $7.35 and $8.20 per option, respectively.  During the three and nine months ended October 30, 2011, we granted approximately 3.1 million  and 6.8 million RSUs, with an estimated total grant-date fair value of $43.9 million and $111.8 million and a weighted average grant-date fair value of $14.34 and $16.43 per RSU, respectively.  Of the estimated total grant-date fair value, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to the equity awards that are not expected to vest was $11.8 million and $25.4 million for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2012, respectively, and  $11.8 million and  $29.2 million for the three and nine months ended October 30, 2011, respectively.  As of October 28, 2012 and October 30, 2011, the aggregate amount of unearned stock-based compensation expense related to our equity awards was $226.5 million and $206.1 million, respectively, adjusted for estimated forfeitures.  As of October 28, 2012 and October 30, 2011, we expect to recognize the unearned stock-based compensation expense related to stock options over an estimated weighted average amortization period of 2.8 years and 2.7 years, respectively.  As of October 28, 2012 and October 30, 2011, we expect to recognize the unearned stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs over an estimated weighted average amortization period of 2.9 years and 2.7 years, respectively.Valuation Assumptions We utilize a binomial model for calculating the estimated fair value of new stock-based compensation awards granted under our equity incentive plans.  We have determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be reflective of market conditions and, therefore, can be expected to be a reasonable indicator of our expected volatility. We also segregate options into groups of employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model.  As such, the expected term assumption used in calculating the estimated fair value of our stock-based compensation awards using the binomial model is based on detailed historical data about employees' exercise behavior, vesting schedules, and death and disability probabilities.  Our management believes the resulting binomial calculation provides a reasonable estimate of the fair value of our employee stock options. For our employee stock purchase plan, we continue to use the Black-Scholes model.   We estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.10NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited) The fair value of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan have been estimated at the date of grant with the following assumptions: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 28, 2012 October 30, 2011 October 28, 2012 October 30, 2011Stock Options(Using a binomial model)Expected life (in years)4.3-4.9 4.1-4.9 3.1-4.9 3.6-5.4Risk free interest rate1.7%-1.8% 1.9%-2.4% 1.5%-2.3% 1.9%-3.8%Volatility45%-49% 58%-65% 43%-49% 46%-65%Dividend yield— — — — Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 28, 2012 October 30, 2011 October 28, 2012 October 30, 2011Employee Stock Purchase Plan(Using a Black-Scholes model)Expected life (in years)0.5-2.0 0.5-2.0 0.5-2.0 0.5-2.0Risk free interest rate0.1%-0.2% 0.1%-0.2% 0.1%-0.3% 0.1%-0.7%Volatility47% 61% 44%-47% 57%-61%Dividend yield— — — — Equity Award Activity The following summarizes the stock option and RSU activity under our equity incentive plans:  Options Outstanding Weighted Average Exercise PriceStock Options(In thousands) (Per share)Balances, January 29, 201233,329 $14.44Granted6,827 $13.94Exercised(3,348) $8.79Cancelled(3,396) $16.98Balances, October 28, 201233,412 $14.66  RSUsOutstanding Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair ValueRestricted Stock Units(In thousands) (Per share)Balances, January 29, 201213,638 $15.10Granted7,486 $13.99Vested(5,670) $15.03Cancelled(656) $15.26Balances, October 28, 201214,798 $14.55 11NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Note 3 – Net Income Per ShareThe following is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented:   Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 28, October 30, October 28, October 30, 2012 2011 2012 2011 (In thousands, except per share data)Numerator:       Net income$209,080 $178,273 $388,563 $465,065Denominator:       Denominator for basic net income per share, weighted average shares622,352 607,063 619,043 600,563Effect of dilutive securities:       Equity awards outstanding6,493 6,497 6,930 14,125Denominator for diluted net income per share, weighted average shares628,845 613,560 625,973 614,688Net income per share:       Basic net income per share$0.34 $0.29 $0.63 $0.77Diluted net income per share$0.33 $0.29 $0.62 $0.76Potentially dilutive securities excluded from income per diluted share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive27,555 25,131 31,697 22,03312NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Note 4 – Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of $44.5 million and $87.4 million for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2012, respectively, and $26.5 million and $73.8 million for the three and nine months ended October 30, 2011, respectively.  Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes, or our effective tax rate, was 17.6% and 18.4% for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2012, respectively, and 13.0% and 13.7% for the three and nine months ended October 30, 2011, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 as compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year was primarily related to the expiration of the U.S. federal research tax credit on December 31, 2011, which provided no tax benefit for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2012.Our effective tax rate on income before tax for the first nine months of fiscal year 2013 of 18.4% and fiscal year 2012 of 13.7% were lower than the United States federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions where the tax rate is lower than the United States federal statutory tax, and for fiscal year 2012 due to the benefit of the U.S. federal research tax credit.         We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or as a reduction of the amount of a net operating loss carryforward or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year.  Likewise, the amount is classified as a long-term liability if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year.  For the nine months ended October 28, 2012, we increased unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $56.2 million, primarily on account of  tax position with respect to an acquired tax attribute, and decreased unrecognized tax benefits by $5.0 million, thereby recognizing the related tax benefits, due to the expiration of statutes of  limitations in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. There have been no other significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits, related interest or penalties from our fiscal year ended January 29, 2012.  For the nine months ended October 28, 2012, there have been no material changes to our tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions.  While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where it is believed not more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities. As of October 28, 2012, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.13NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Note 5 - Marketable Securities All of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified as “available-for-sale” securities. These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders’ equity, net of tax.We performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of October 28, 2012. Based on our quarterly impairment review and having considered the guidance in the relevant accounting literature, we concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and that no other than temporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio as of October 28, 2012.

The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets.  Our Level 1 assets consist of our money market fund deposits. We classify securities within Level 1 assets when the fair value is obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets.  Our available-for-sale securities are classified as having Level 2 inputs.  Our Level 2 assets are valued utilizing a market approach where the market prices of similar assets are provided by a variety of independent industry standard data providers to our investment custodian.  There were no significant transfers between Levels 1 and 2 assets for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2012.Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are summarized below:  Fair Value Measurement at Reporting Date Using   Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets Significant Other Observable Inputs October 28, 2012 (Level 1) (Level 2) (In thousands)Debt securities issued by United States government agencies (1)$847,596 $— $847,596Debt securities issued by United States Treasury (1)695,466 — 695,466Corporate debt securities (2)1,191,658 — 1,191,658Mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored entities (1)190,661 — 190,661Money market funds (3)85,030 85,030 —Total cash equivalents and marketable securities$3,010,411 $85,030 $2,925,381 (1) Included in Marketable Securities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.(2)  Includes $16.0 million in Cash Equivalents and $1,175.7 million in Marketable Securities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.(3)Included in Cash Equivalents on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.     15NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Note 7 - 3dfxDuring fiscal year 2002, we completed the purchase of certain assets from 3dfx Interactive, Inc., or 3dfx, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $74.2 million. On December 15, 2000, NVIDIA Corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or the APA, which closed on April 18, 2001, to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx. In October 2002, 3dfx filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. In March 2003, the Trustee appointed by the Bankruptcy Court to represent 3dfx’s bankruptcy estate served his complaint on NVIDIA.  The Trustee’s complaint asserted claims for, among other things, successor liability and fraudulent transfer and sought additional payments from us. In early November 2005, NVIDIA and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, or the Creditors’ Committee, agreed to a Plan of Liquidation of 3dfx, which included a conditional settlement of the Trustee’s claims against us. This conditional settlement was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the Bankruptcy Court. The conditional settlement called for a payment by NVIDIA of approximately $30.6 million to the 3dfx estate. Under the settlement, $5.6 million related to various administrative expenses and Trustee fees, and $25.0 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx. Accordingly, during the three month period ended October 30, 2005, we recorded $5.6 million as a charge to settlement costs and $25.0 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx. The Trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement.  The conditional settlement reached in November 2005 never progressed through the confirmation process and the Trustee’s case still remains pending appeal.  As such, we have not reversed the accrual of $30.6 million - $5.6 million as a charge to settlement costs and $25.0 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx – that we recorded during the three months ended October 30, 2005, pending resolution of the appeal of the Trustee’s case. The 3dfx asset purchase price of $95.0 million and $4.2 million of direct transaction costs were allocated based on fair values presented below. The final allocation of the purchase price of the 3dfx assets is contingent upon the outcome of all of the 3dfx litigation.

Icera develops baseband processors for 3G and 4G cellular phones and tablets.  In addition to leveraging on the existing Icera business, the objective of the acquisition is to accelerate and enhance the combination of our application processor with Icera’s baseband processor for use in mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.Total consideration to acquire Icera was $352.2 million in cash. All existing Icera equity based incentive plans were terminated upon the completion of the acquisition.  In connection with the acquisition of Icera, we established a retention program in the aggregate amount of approximately $68.0 million to be paid out to Icera employees over a period of four years.The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by major class in the acquisition of Icera were recognized as follows (in thousands):Cash$3,315Accounts receivable13,740Inventory13,510Prepaid and other current assets1,972Deferred tax assets13,036Property, plant and equipment3,649Goodwill271,186Intangible assets97,515Other assets591Total assets acquired418,514  Accounts payable(6,026)Accrued liabilities(38,735)Notes payable(10,319)Income taxes payable(4,558)Deferred income tax liabilities(6,677)Net assets acquired$352,199The goodwill of $271.2 million arising from the acquisition is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce of Icera and premium paid over net assets acquired.  Goodwill recognized is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. We have determined that goodwill from the acquisition of Icera should be allocated to our Consumer Products Business, or CPB, operating segment.    In addition, revenue contribution from Icera was not significant for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2012. 17NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)The acquisition-related intangible assets assumed from the acquisition of Icera were recognized as follows based upon their fair values as of June 10, 2011: Intangible Assets Fair Value Weighted-AverageEstimated Useful Lives  (In thousands) (In years)Technology $58,300 7.4In-process technology $20,200 5.0Customer relationships $18,200 6.8 TechnologyTechnology consists of core technology and existing technology. Core technology represents a series of processes and trade secrets that are used in Icera’s products and form a major part of the architecture of both the current products and planned future releases of current products. We used a profit allocation method to value the core technology of Icera, based on market royalties for similar fundamental technologies. The profit allocation method estimates the cost savings that accrue to the owner of an intangible asset that would otherwise be payable on revenues earned through the use of the asset. The royalty rate we used was based on an analysis of empirical, market-derived royalty rates for guideline intangible assets. Revenue was projected over the expected remaining useful life of the core technology and then the market-derived royalty rate was applied to estimate the royalty savings.Existing technology is specific to certain products acquired that have also passed technological feasibility. We used an income approach to value Icera’s existing technology. Using this approach, we calculated the estimated fair value using expected future cash flows from specific products discounted to their net present values at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return. In-Process Technology In-process technology, or IPR&D, represents the fair values of incomplete Icera research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition. In the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we deemed these projects as complete and have estimated a definite life of five years, over which the technology will be amortized.The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using the income approach. Under the income approach, the expected future cash flows from each project under development were estimated and discounted to their net present values at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return. Significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return were the weighted average cost of capital, the return on assets, as well as the risks inherent in the development process, including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance. Each project was analyzed to determine the unique technological innovations, the existence and reliance on core technology, the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility, and the complexity, cost and time to complete the remaining development. Future cash flows for each project were estimated based on forecasted revenue and costs, taking into account the expected product life cycles, market penetration and growth rates.Customer Relationships  Customer relationships represent the fair value of projected cash flows that will be derived from the sale of products to Icera’s existing customers based on existing, in-process, and future versions of the underlying technology.18NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Note 9 - Intangible Assets The components of our amortizable intangible assets are as follows: October 28, 2012 January 29, 2012 GrossCarryingAmount AccumulatedAmortization Net CarryingAmount GrossCarryingAmount Accumulated Amortization Net CarryingAmount (In thousands)Acquisition-related intangible assets$172,039 $(92,063) $79,976 $172,039 $(79,261) $92,778Patents and licensed technology408,552 (157,280) 251,272 352,386 (119,028) 233,358Total intangible assets$580,591 $(249,343) $331,248 $524,425 $(198,289) $326,136The increase in gross carrying amount of intangible assets is primarily due to an agreement entered into during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 to acquire a patent portfolio for our CPB operating segment.     Amortization expense associated with intangible assets for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2012 was $17.3 million and $51.1 million, respectively. Amortization expense associated with intangible assets for the three and nine months ended October 30, 2011 was $16.4 million and $42.9 million, respectively.  Amortization expense increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the addition of a patent portfolio.

We have also on occasion included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability.  As such, we have not recorded any liability in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications. 22NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies3dfxOn December 15, 2000, NVIDIA and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or APA, to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx.  The transaction closed on April 18, 2001.  That acquisition, and 3dfx's October 2002 bankruptcy filing, led to four lawsuits against NVIDIA: two brought by 3dfx's former landlords, one by 3dfx's bankruptcy trustee and the fourth by a committee of 3dfx's equity security holders in the bankruptcy estate.  The two landlord cases have been settled with payments from the landlords to NVIDIA, and the equity security holders lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice and no appeal was filed.  Accordingly, only the bankruptcy trustee suit remains outstanding as more fully explained below.  In March 2003, the Trustee appointed by the Bankruptcy Court to represent 3dfx's bankruptcy estate served a complaint on NVIDIA asserting claims for, among other things, successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seeking additional payments from us.  The Trustee's fraudulent transfer theory alleged that NVIDIA had failed to pay reasonably equivalent value for 3dfx's assets, and sought recovery of the difference between the $70.0 million paid and the alleged fair value, which the Trustee estimated to exceed $50.0 million.  The Trustee's successor liability theory alleged NVIDIA was effectively 3dfx's legal successor and therefore was responsible for all of 3dfx's unpaid liabilities.   On October 13, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court heard the Trustee's motion for summary adjudication, and on December 23, 2005, denied that motion in all material respects and held that NVIDIA may not dispute that the value of the 3dfx transaction was less than $108.0 million. The Bankruptcy Court denied the Trustee's request to find that the value of the 3dfx assets conveyed to NVIDIA was at least $108.0 million. In early November 2005, after several months of mediation, NVIDIA and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, or the Creditors' Committee, agreed to a Plan of Liquidation of 3dfx, which included a conditional settlement of the Trustee's claims against us. This conditional settlement was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the Bankruptcy Court. The conditional settlement called for a payment by NVIDIA of approximately $30.6 million to the 3dfx estate. Under the settlement, $5.6 million related to various administrative expenses and Trustee fees, and $25.0 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx. Accordingly, during the three month period ended October 30, 2005, we recorded $5.6 million as a charge to settlement costs and $25.0 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx.  The Trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement. The conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process.On December 21, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court scheduled a trial for one portion of the Trustee's case against NVIDIA. On January 2, 2007, NVIDIA terminated the settlement agreement on grounds that the Bankruptcy Court had failed to proceed toward confirmation of the Creditors' Committee's plan. A non-jury trial began on March 21, 2007 on valuation issues in the Trustee's constructive fraudulent transfer claims against NVIDIA. Specifically, the Bankruptcy Court tried four questions: (1) what did 3dfx transfer to NVIDIA in the APA; (2) of what was transferred, what qualifies as “property” subject to the Bankruptcy Court's avoidance powers under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act and relevant bankruptcy code provisions; (3) what is the fair market value of the “property” identified in answer to question (2); and (4) was the $70.0 million that NVIDIA paid “reasonably equivalent” to the fair market value of that property. The parties completed post-trial briefing on May 25, 2007.On April 30, 2008, the Bankruptcy Court issued its Memorandum Decision After Trial, in which it provided a detailed summary of the trial proceedings and the parties' contentions and evidence and concluded that “the creditors of 3dfx were not injured by the Transaction.”  This decision did not entirely dispose of the Trustee's action, however, as the Trustee's claims for successor liability and intentional fraudulent conveyance were still pending.  On June 19, 2008, NVIDIA filed a motion for summary judgment to convert the Memorandum Decision After Trial to a final judgment.  That motion was granted in its entirety and judgment was entered in NVIDIA's favor on September 11, 2008.  The Trustee filed a Notice of Appeal from that judgment on September 22, 2008, and on September 25, 2008, NVIDIA exercised its election to have the appeal heard by the United States District Court.    The District Court's hearing on the Trustee's appeal was held on June 10, 2009. On December 20, 2010, the District Court issued an Order affirming the Bankruptcy Court's entry of summary judgment in NVIDIA's favor. On January 19, 2011, the Trustee filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The appeal is currently pending.23NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)While the conditional settlement reached in November 2005 never progressed through the confirmation process, the Trustee's case still remains pending on appeal.  Accordingly, we have not reversed the accrual of $30.6 million - $5.6 million as a charge to settlement costs and $25.0 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx - that we recorded during the three months ended October 30, 2005, pending resolution of the appeal of the Trustee's case.    Product Defect Litigation and Securities CasesProduct Defect LitigationIn September, October and November 2008, several putative consumer class action lawsuits were filed against us, asserting various claims arising from a weak die/packaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation products used in notebook configurations.   On February 26, 2009, the various lawsuits were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Jose Division, under the caption “The NVIDIA GPU Litigation.”  On March 2, 2009, several of the parties filed motions for appointment of lead counsel and briefs addressing certain related issues.  On April 10, 2009, the District Court appointed Milberg LLP lead counsel.  On May 6, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an Amended Consolidated Complaint, alleging claims for violations of California Business and Professions Code Section 17200, Breach of Implied Warranty under California Civil Code Section 1792, Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability under the laws of 27 other states, Breach of Warranty under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, Unjust Enrichment, violations of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, Strict Liability and Negligence, and violation of California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act.After extensive motion practice and litigation, plaintiffs on December 14, 2009 filed a Second Amended Consolidated Complaint seeking unspecified damages and asserting claims for violations of California Business and Professions Code Section 17200, Breach of Implied Warranty under California Civil Code Section 1792, Breach of Warranty under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, violations of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, Strict Liability and Negligence, and violation of California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act.    On July 16, 2010, the parties filed a stipulation with the District Court advising that, following mediation they had reached a settlement in principle in The NVIDIA GPU Litigation.  The settlement in principle was subject to certain approvals, including final approval by the court.  As a result of the settlement in principle, and the other estimated settlement, and offsetting insurance reimbursements, NVIDIA recorded a net charge of $12.7 million to sales, general and administrative expense during the second quarter of fiscal year 2011.  In addition, a portion of the $181.2 million of additional charges we recorded against cost of revenue related to the weak die/packaging set during the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, relates to estimated additional repair and replacement costs related to the implementation of these settlements. On August 12, 2010, the parties executed a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement and Release. On September 15, 2010, the Court issued an order granting preliminary approval of the settlement and providing for notice to the potential class members. The Final Approval Hearing was held on December 20, 2010, and on that same day the Court approved the settlement and entered Final Judgment over several objections. In January 2011, several objectors filed Notices of Appeal of the Final Judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The appeal is currently pending.On July 22, 2011, a putative class action titled Granfield v. NVIDIA Corp. was filed in federal court in Massachusetts asserting claims for breach of implied warranties arising out of the weak die/packaging material set, on behalf of a class of consumers alleged to not be covered by the settlement approved by the California court in The NVIDIA GPU Litigation.  On November 3, 2011 the action was transferred to the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division, based upon stipulation of the parties.  On December 30, 2011, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint asserting claims for violation of California Consumers Legal Remedies Act and Unfair Competition Law.  On March 19, 2012, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint asserting claims for California Consumers Legal Remedies Act and Unfair Competition Law violations, Breach of Implied Warranty, and violations of the Massachusetts consumer protection statutes.  NVIDIA filed a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint on April 12, 2012.     On July 12, 2012, the District Court dismissed six of the seven asserted causes of action with prejudice, allowing only one cause of action for violation of the Massachusetts consumer protection statute to continue, and instructed Plaintiff to file an amended complaint consistent with its Order.  On August 15, 2012, Plaintiff indicated that he would not be filing an amended complaint. The Granfield case is now over.  24NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Securities CasesIn September 2008, three putative securities class actions, or the Actions, were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California arising out of our announcements on July 2, 2008, that we would take a charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated costs and expenses arising from a weak die/packaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation MCP and GPU products and that we were revising financial guidance for our second quarter of fiscal year 2009. The Actions purport to be brought on behalf of purchasers of NVIDIA stock and assert claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act.  On October 30, 2008, the Actions were consolidated under the caption In re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, Civil Action No. 08-CV-04260-JW (HRL). Lead Plaintiffs and Lead Plaintiffs' Counsel were appointed on December 23, 2008. On February 6, 2009, co-Lead Plaintiff filed a Writ of Mandamus with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals challenging the designation of co-Lead Plaintiffs' Counsel. On February 19, 2009, co-Lead Plaintiff filed with the District Court, a motion to stay the District Court proceedings pending resolution of the Writ of Mandamus by the Ninth Circuit. On February 24, 2009, Judge Ware granted the stay. On November 5, 2009, the Court of Appeals issued an opinion reversing the District Court's appointment of one of the lead plaintiffs' counsel, and remanding the matter for further proceedings.   On December 8, 2009, the District Court appointed Milberg LLP and Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC as co-lead counsel.  On January 22, 2010, Plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint for Violations of the Federal Securities Laws, asserting claims for violations of Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5, and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act.  The consolidated complaint sought unspecified compensatory damages.  We filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint in March 2010 and a hearing was held on June 24, 2010 before Judge Seeborg. On October 19, 2010, Judge Seeborg granted our motion to dismiss with leave to amend. On December 2, 2010, co-Lead Plaintiffs filed a Second Consolidated Amended Complaint.  We moved to dismiss the Second Consolidated Amended Complaint on February 14, 2011.  Following oral argument, on October 12, 2011, Judge Seeborg granted our motion to dismiss without leave to amend, and on November 8, 2011, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit.  The appeal has been fully briefed, but the Ninth Circuit has not yet set a hearing date.   Accounting for Loss ContingenciesWhile there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe the claims made by other parties in the above ongoing matters are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend the actions. With the exception of the 3dfx and product defect litigation cases, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any possible range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in other legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of its business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.25NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Note 13 - Stockholders’ Equity    Stock Repurchase Program In fiscal year 2007, our Board of Directors, or Board, authorized us, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an aggregate maximum amount of $2.7 billion through May 2013.  In October 2012, the Board extended the program through December 2014. The repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured stock repurchase programs, and may be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. As part of our stock repurchase program, we have entered into, and we may continue to enter into, structured stock repurchase transactions with financial institutions. These agreements generally require that we make an up-front payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock, within a pre-determined range, at the end of the term of the agreement.  We did not enter into any structured stock repurchase transactions or otherwise purchase any shares of our common stock during the three and nine months ended October 28, 2012. Through October 28, 2012, we have repurchased an aggregate of 90.9 million shares under our stock repurchase program for a total cost of $1.46 billion.  As of October 28, 2012, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $1.24 billion.     Convertible Preferred Stock As of October 28, 2012 and January 29, 2012, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.   Common Stock We are authorized to issue up to 2,000,000,000 shares of our common stock at $0.001 per share par value.      26NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Note 14 - Segment Information Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. We report financial information for three operating segments to our CODM: Graphics Processing Unit, or GPU, Business; Professional Solutions Business, or PSB; and Consumer Products Business, or CPB.   The GPU business is comprised of our desktop, notebook, memory and chipset products.  Our GPU business also includes license revenue in connection with our patent cross license agreement with Intel.  The PSB includes Quadro workstation graphics and Tesla high-performance computing products.  The CPB is comprised of Tegra based smartphone and tablet products as well as Icera baseband processors and radio frequency transceivers.  Our CPB also includes embedded products for entertainment and automotive devices as well as license and royalty revenue associated with game consoles.In addition to these operating segments, we also have an “All Other” category that includes non-recurring charges and benefits which we do not allocate to our operating segments as these items are not included in the segment operating performance measures evaluated by our CODM.  On June 12, 2012, we pledged a charitable contribution of $25.0 million to Stanford Hospital and Clinics, payable over a ten year period.  The charitable contribution was recorded at its net present value of $20.1 million and is considered a non-recurring charge for the nine months ended October 28, 2012. There were no non-recurring charges or benefits for the three and nine months ended October 30, 2011.     Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis. Operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same for NVIDIA as a whole. GPU PSB CPB All Other Consolidated (In thousands)Three Months Ended October 28, 2012         Revenue$739,652 $220,557 $243,901 $— $1,204,110Depreciation and amortization expense$32,351 $4,278 $20,519 $— $57,148Operating income (loss)$193,226 $100,895 $(41,904) $— $252,217Three Months Ended  October 30, 2011         Revenue$644,802 $230,295 $191,083 $— $1,066,180Depreciation and amortization expense$29,547 $5,427 $17,413 $— $52,387Operating income (loss)$146,843 $95,887 $(45,640) $— $197,090Nine Months Ended October 28, 2012         Revenue$1,987,671 $629,527 $556,059 $— $3,173,257Depreciation and amortization expense$96,481 $13,109 $58,244 $— $167,834Operating income (loss)$434,818 $283,520 $(233,545) $(20,127) $464,666Nine Months Ended October 30, 2011         Revenue$1,920,935 $642,425 $481,376 $— $3,044,736Depreciation and amortization expense$89,238 $17,414 $45,658 $— $152,310Operating income (loss)$406,833 $235,635 $(116,486) $— $525,98227NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers’ revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location.

With the invention of the graphics processing unit, or GPU, we introduced the world to the power of computer graphics. Today, we reach well beyond PC graphics. Our energy-efficient processors power a broad range of products, from smartphones to supercomputers. Our mobile processors are used in cell phones, tablets and auto infotainment systems. PC gamers rely on our GPUs to enjoy visually immersive worlds. Designers use GPUs to create visual effects in movies and create everything from golf clubs to jumbo jets. Researchers utilize GPUs to push the frontiers of science with high-performance computing. NVIDIA has over 5,000 patents granted and pending worldwide. NVIDIA solutions are based on two important technologies: the GPU and the mobile processor. Both are highly complex chips, designed by NVIDIA engineers, and manufactured for us by a third party chip foundry. GPUs are the engines of visual computing, the science and art of using computers to understand, create and enhance images. One of the most complex processors ever created, the most advanced GPUs contain billions of transistors. We have three GPU product brands: GeForce, which creates realistic visual experiences for gamers; Quadro, the standard in visual computing for designers and digital artists; and Tesla, which accelerates applications for scientists and researchers. Mobile processors incorporate central processing unit, or CPU, and GPU technologies to deliver an entire computer system on a single chip, or system-on-chip. Modern mobile processors possess significant computing capabilities yet consume one hundred times less energy than a typical PC. Tegra is our mobile processor and is built for applications ranging from smartphones, tablets and notebook PCs to televisions and cars. We believe energy-efficient mobile computing will transform how computers are used in our lives.  29We were incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Our headquarter facilities are in Santa Clara, California.  Our Internet address is www.nvidia.com. The contents of our website are not a part of this Form 10-Q.Recent Developments, Future Objectives and ChallengesGPU Business During the third quarter of fiscal year 2013,  our Kepler-based GPU architecture was extended to lower price points with the launch of our GeForce 660 Ti, GeForce GTX 660, GeForce GTX 650 Ti and GeForce GTX 650 products.  During the second quarter of fiscal year 2013, original equipment manufacturers announced more Kepler-based notebooks.  Included among them were new notebooks from Acer, Apple, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung and Sony. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, we had refreshed our notebook GPUs with the launch of the GeForce 600M series.  Acer's Aspire Timeline M3, which incorporates the GeForce 600M, is the first Ultrabook with an NVIDIA GPU.      During the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, we launched our new Kepler GPU architecture.  Our first Kepler products to be launched were the GeForce GTX 670 and GeForce GTX 680, which are faster, smaller and more power efficient than our previous architecture.  We also introduced our third GeForce Kepler product, the GeForce GTX 690, which uses two Kepler GPUs to further enhance performance. Professional Solutions Business During the third quarter of fiscal year 2013, Oak Ridge National Laboratory announced the completion of their Titan supercomputer, powered by almost nineteen thousand of our Tesla K20 GPU accelerators.  Additionally, we also launched the VGX K2 graphic processor based on the Kepler architecture, for cloud-based workstation graphics and brought our Kepler architecture to Mac professional with the NVIDIA Quadro 5000 for Apple Mac Pro systems. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2013, we introduced the Tesla K10 and K20 GPU for use in high performance computing applications, including seismic processing, life sciences and video processing.  Further, we announced that the space research organization in India was utilizing their Supercomputer for Aerospace with GPU Architecture, or SAGA, system to improve the design and analysis of new and existing satellite launch vehicles.  Consumer Products Business       During the third quarter of fiscal year 2013, Microsoft launched its Surface RT, powered by Tegra-3.  During the second quarter of fiscal year 2013, Google announced that our Tegra 3 would power its Nexus 7 tablet.  Nexus is the first device to run Jelly Bean, the latest version of the Android operating system.  Also, Microsoft announced that a Tegra processor would be powering the Windows RT Surface tablet.  Further, Fujitsu's Arrows X, a quad-core LTE smartphone powered by Tegra 3, began shipping into Japan in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013.   Additionally, Tegra processors also began shipping in the 17-inch touchscreen infotainment and navigation system in Tesla Motors' new Model S.  During the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, the first Tegra 3 phone, the HTC One X, was launched.  Other noteworthy phone wins announced at Mobile World Congress in March 2012 include ZTE, the first Tegra plus Icera phone, Fujitsu, LG and K-Touch.        Stock Repurchase and Cash Dividend Programs         In fiscal year 2007, our Board of Directors authorized us, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an aggregate maximum amount of $2.7 billion through May 2013.  In October 2012, the Board extended the program through December 2014.  Through October 28, 2012, we have repurchased an aggregate of 90.9 million shares under our stock repurchase program for a total cost of $1.46 billion.  As of October 28, 2012, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $1.24 billion.30   On November 8, 2012, we announced the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program.  The initial quarterly dividend of 7.5 cents per share is equivalent to 30 cents per share on an annual basis.  The initial cash dividend will be payable on December 14, 2012 to all common stockholders of record at the close of business on November 23, 2012. Financial Information by Business Segment and Geographic DataOur Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. We report financial information for three operating segments to our CODM: Graphics Processing Unit, or GPU, Business; Professional Solutions Business, or PSB; and Consumer Products Business, or CPB.   The GPU business is comprised of our desktop, notebook, memory and chipset products.  Our GPU business also includes license revenue in connection with our patent cross license agreement with Intel.  The PSB includes Quadro workstation graphics and Tesla high-performance computing products.  The CPB is comprised of Tegra based smartphone and tablet products as well as Icera baseband processors and radio frequency transceivers.  Our CPB also includes embedded products for entertainment and automotive devices as well as license and royalty revenue associated with game consoles.In addition to these operating segments, we also have an “All Other” category that includes non-recurring charges and benefits which we do not allocate to our operating segments as these items are not included in the segment operating performance measures evaluated by our CODM.  On June 12, 2012, we pledged a charitable contribution of $25.0 million to Stanford Hospital and Clinics, payable over a ten year period.  The charitable contribution was recorded at its net present value of $20.1 million and is considered a non-recurring charge for the first nine months of fiscal year 2013. There were no non-recurring charges or benefits for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2012.  Please refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further disclosure regarding segment information.Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis. Operating segments do not record intersegment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for NVIDIA as a whole.Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our condensed consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue. Three Months Ended  Nine Months Ended  October 28, 2012  October 30, 2011  October 28, 2012  October 30, 2011 Revenue100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0%Cost of revenue47.1  47.8  48.3  48.6 Gross profit52.9  52.2  51.7  51.4 Operating expenses           Research and development23.6  24.1  26.8  24.2 Sales, general and administrative8.3  9.7  10.3  10.0 Total operating expenses31.9  33.8  37.1  34.2 Operating income21.0  18.5  14.6  17.2 Interest and other income, net0.1  0.7  0.4  0.4 Income before income tax21.1  19.2  15.0  17.6 Income tax expense3.7  2.5  2.8  2.4 Net income17.4% 16.7% 12.2% 15.2%   31 Three and nine months ended October 28, 2012 and October 30, 2011RevenueRevenue was $1.20 billion for our third quarter of fiscal year 2013, compared to $1.07 billion for our third quarter of fiscal year 2012, which represents an increase of approximately 12.9%.  A discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows:GPU Business. GPU business revenue increased by approximately 14.7% to $739.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013, compared to $644.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2012.  GPU revenues increased due to richer product mix driven by sales of our high-end desktop 28 nanometer Kepler products, offset slightly by a decrease of mainstream desktop sales.  Notebook revenues increased as a result of strong design wins based on Intel's Ivy Bridge platform.  Memory sales also increased as a result of strength in high-end desktop products.  Offsetting these increases were decreases in revenues from our media and communications processors, or MCPs, as these chipsets approach their end of life.      GPU business revenue increased by approximately 3.5% to $1.99 billion for the first nine months of fiscal year 2013, compared to $1.92 billion for the first nine months of fiscal year 2012.  GPU revenues increased due to richer product mix driven by sales of our high-end desktop 28 nanometer Kepler products, offset slightly by a decrease of mainstream desktop sales.   Notebook revenues also increased as a result of strong design wins based on Intel's Ivy Bridge platform.  Additionally, the first nine months of fiscal year 2013 included the full impact of nine months of revenue from the cross licensing arrangement with Intel, while the first nine months of fiscal year 2012 only included seven months of the corresponding revenue.  Offsetting these increases were decreases in revenues from our MCP chipsets as these products approach their end of life.PSB. PSB revenue decreased by approximately 4.2% to $220.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013, compared to $230.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012, and decreased by 2.0% to $629.5 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2013, compared to $642.4 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2012.  These decreases were mainly due to lower sales of our Quadro products, which have been challenged by the macroeconomic environment including weak economic conditions in Europe and softness in other geographies.  Conversely, sales of our Tesla products were up in both the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2013, driven largely by the first shipments of our new Kepler-based Tesla products to Oak Ridge National Laboratory in connection with the build of their new Titan supercomputer. CPB. CPB revenue increased by approximately 27.6% to $243.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013, compared to $191.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2012.  This increase was primarily due to higher sales of our Tegra 3-based devices as we transitioned from the previous generation Tegra 2-based products, as well as increased sales of embedded products for automotive devices.  Offsetting these increases were decreases in license and royalty revenue associated with game consoles and a decrease in revenue from embedded entertainment products.  CPB revenue increased by approximately 15.5% to $556.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2013, compared to $481.4 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2012.  The main drivers for the increase were higher sales of our Tegra products and higher sales of our embedded products for entertainment and automotive devices.  Offsetting these increases was a decrease in license and royalty revenue associated with game consoles.Concentration of Revenue  Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and Other Americas accounted for 72% and 75% of total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively, and were 75% and 79% of total revenue for the first nine months of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively.  Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location. Revenue from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total revenue, was approximately 14% and 12% of our total revenue from one customer for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2012, respectively.  Revenue from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total revenue, was approximately 11% of our total revenue from one customer for the three and nine months ended October 30, 2011. 32Gross Profit and Gross Margin  Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue.  Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license, service arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing. Gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue. Our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of products sold. Our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products we sell. Product mix is often difficult to estimate with accuracy.  Therefore, if we experience product transition challenges, if we achieve significant revenue growth in our lower margin product lines, or if we are unable to earn as much revenue as we expect from higher margin product lines, our gross margin may be negatively impacted.Our overall gross margin was 52.9% and 52.2% for the third quarter of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively, and 51.7%   and 51.4% for the first nine months of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively.      We expect our gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 to be relatively consistent with the third quarter of fiscal year 2013.  A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our operating segments is as follows:GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU business increased in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 from the third quarter of fiscal year 2012.  GPU margins increased primarily due to an increase in unit volume  of our high-end 28 nanometer Kepler-based desktop and notebook products which contributed to a richer overall mix toward high-end GPU product sales. The gross margin of our GPU business increased slightly between the first nine months of fiscal year 2013 and first nine months of fiscal year 2012, also due primarily to a richer product mix favoring a higher volume of our high-end desktop and notebook products based on our 28 nanometer Kepler technology.  Additionally, we recognized a full nine months of revenue from the cross licensing arrangement with Intel in the first nine months of fiscal year 2013 as compared to seven months of such revenue for the first nine months of fiscal year 2012, which also contributed to the gross margin improvement.         PSB. The gross margin of our PSB improved in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 when compared to third quarter of fiscal year 2012 as well as in the first nine months of fiscal year 2013 when compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2012, due primarily to a richer product mix.        CPB. The gross margin of our CPB remained relatively flat in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 when compared with the third quarter of fiscal year 2012.   Gross margin of our CPB decreased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2013 when compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2012, primarily due to a shift in mix within Tegra products and due to decreases in licenses and royalty revenue associated with game consoles when compared to the same periods in the prior year.   33Operating Expenses  Three Months Ended  Nine Months Ended  October 28, 2012 October 30, 2011 $Change %Change  October 28, 2012  October 30, 2011 $Change %Change  ($ in millions)    ($ in millions)   Research and development expenses$284.2 $256.5 $27.7 10.8% $849.3  $735.7 $113.5 15.4%Sales, general and administrative expenses100.3 103.1 (2.8) (2.8)% 326.8  304.8 22.0 7.2%Total operating expenses$384.5 $359.6 $24.8 6.9% $1,176.1  $1,040.5 $135.6 13.0%Research and development as a percentage of net revenue23.6%24.1%     26.8% 24.2%    Sales, general and administrative as a percentage of net revenue8.3%9.7%     10.3% 10.0%    Research and Development Research and development expenses were $284.2 million and $256.5 million during the third quarter of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively, an increase of $27.7 million, or 10.8%.  This increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits of $22.6 million, driven by growth in headcount.  Research and development expenses were $849.3 million and $735.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively, an increase of $113.5 million, or 15.4%.  Compensation and benefits increased by $75.9 million, other employee related expenses increased by $1.9 million, and computer software and equipment expense increased by $2.3 million, primarily driven by growth in headcount.  Development cost increased by $7.4 million primarily as a result of development costs associated with the ramp up and launch of our Kepler 28 nanometer technology and other products.  Depreciation and amortization increased by $8.4 million primarily due to amortization of intangibles associated with our acquisition of Icera, as well as purchases of additional hardware and licenses. Sales, General and Administrative Sales, general and administrative expenses were $100.3 million and $103.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $2.8 million, or 2.8%.  The decrease was primarily attributable due to a reduction in professional service costs associated with the acquisition of Icera in the prior fiscal year and in other litigation matters.  These decreases were offset by an increase in compensation and benefits related to growth in headcount.Sales, general and administrative expenses were $326.8 million and $304.8 million for the first nine months of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively, an increase of $22.0 million, or 7.2%.  The increase was primarily attributable due to a $20.1 million expense for the net present value of a charitable contribution, made in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013.  Also contributing to the increase was $15.1 million of compensation and benefits, primarily driven by growth in headcount. These increases were offset by a $12.4 million decrease in professional services costs associated with the acquisition of Icera in the prior fiscal year and other litigation matters.We expect operating expenses to increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. 34 Interest Income Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $4.7 million and $4.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively, an increase of $0.3 million.  Interest income was $15.2 million and $14.9 million for the first nine months of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively, an increase of $0.3 million.  Both increases were primarily due to higher average cash balances.  Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense) primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities and foreign currency translation.  Other income (expense) was $(3.3) million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 compared to income of  $3.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012, an increase in expense of $6.6 million.  Other income (expense) was $(4.0) million and $(2.1) million for the first nine months of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively, a increase in expense of $1.9 million. These changes were primarily driven by an increase in foreign currency translation losses in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2013, when compared to third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2012. Income Taxes  We recognized income tax expense of $44.5 million and $87.4 million for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2012, respectively, and $26.5 million and $73.8 million for the three and nine months ended October 30, 2011, respectively.  Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes, or our effective tax rate, was 17.6% and 18.4% for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2012, respectively, and 13.0% and 13.7% for the three and nine months ended October 30, 2011, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 as compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year was primarily related to the expiration of the U.S. federal research tax credit on December 31, 2011, which provided no tax benefit for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2012.Our effective tax rate on income before tax for the first nine months of fiscal year 2013 of 18.4% and fiscal year 2012 of 13.7% were lower than the United States federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions where the tax rate is lower than the United States federal statutory tax, and for fiscal year 2012 due to the benefit of the U.S. federal research tax credit.       We expect our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 to be approximately 20%, plus or minus one percentage point, excluding any discrete tax events that may occur during the fourth quarter, which, if realized, may increase or decrease our fourth quarter tax rate. Please refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the components of our income tax expense. Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of October 28, 2012 As of January 29, 2012 (In millions)Cash and cash equivalents$525.4 $667.9Marketable securities2,909.4 2,461.7Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities$3,434.8 $3,129.6 Nine Months Ended October 28, October 30, 2012 2011 (In millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$373.2 $498.6Net cash used in investing activities$(602.6) $(814.9)Net cash provided by financing activities$86.9 $217.735 As of October 28, 2012, we had $3.43 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $305.2 million from $3.13 billion as of January 29, 2012. Our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed on our behalf  by several financial institutions that are required to follow our investment policy, which requires the purchase of top-tier investment grade securities and the diversification of asset type and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. Operating activitiesOperating activities provided cash of $373.2 million and $498.6 million during the first nine months of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in our net income and an increase in inventory, attributable to a ramp in production builds of our Kepler GPU products.Investing activitiesInvesting activities consisted primarily of purchases and sales of marketable securities and purchases of property and equipment, which include leasehold improvements for our facilities and intangible assets.  Investing activities used cash of $602.6 million and $814.9 million during the first nine months of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the absence of acquisition activity during the first nine months of fiscal year 2013.  This was offset by an increase in net purchases, sales and maturities of our available for sale investments.Financing activitiesFinancing activities provided cash of $86.9 million and $217.7 million during the first nine months of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively.  Net cash provided by financing activities decreased in the first nine months  of fiscal year 2013 when compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2012, primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and from the exercise of stock options.      LiquidityOur primary source of liquidity is cash generated by our operations. Our investment portfolio consists of cash and cash equivalents, commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises, equity securities, money market funds and debt securities of corporations, municipalities and the United States government and its agencies. These investments are denominated in United States dollars. As of October 28, 2012, we did not have any investments in auction-rate preferred securities.All of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “available-for-sale”. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be other-than-temporary. We may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because any debt securities we hold are classified as “available-for-sale,” no gains or losses are realized in our statement of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in market values are determined to be other-than-temporary.  These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders’ equity, net of tax.36As of October 28, 2012 and January 29, 2012, we had $3.43 billion and $3.13 billion, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our investment policy requires the purchase of top-tier investment grade securities and the diversification of asset types and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration, as specified in our investment policy guidelines. These guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer or type of instrument. As of October 28, 2012, we were in compliance with our investment policy.  As of October 28, 2012, our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented approximately 58% of our total investment portfolio, while the financial sector accounted for approximately 22% of our total investment portfolio. Of the financial sector investments, 12% are guaranteed by the U.S. government.  All of our investments are with A/A2 or better rated securities.We performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of October 28, 2012. Based on our quarterly impairment review, we concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and did not record any impairment during the third quarter of fiscal year 2013.Net realized gains for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2013 were $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively.  Net realized gains for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2012 were $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively.  As of October 28, 2012, we had a net unrealized gain of $11.8 million, which was comprised of gross unrealized gains of $12.3 million, offset by gross unrealized losses of $0.5 million.  As of January 29, 2012, we had a net unrealized gain of $11.5 million, which was comprised of gross unrealized gains of $12.0 million, offset by $0.5 million of gross unrealized losses.     Our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers’ businesses, and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy. One customer accounted for approximately 19% of our accounts receivable balance at October 28, 2012. While we strive to limit our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable using a combination of credit insurance and letters of credit, difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. These difficulties are heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. We continue to work directly with more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable from them. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required, we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers, and we may be required to pay higher credit insurance premiums, any of which could adversely affect our operating results. In the future, we may have to record additional reserves or write-offs and/or defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results.     Stock Repurchase Program   In fiscal year 2007, our Board of Directors, or "Board" authorized us, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an aggregate maximum amount of $2.7 billion through May 2013.   In October 2012, the Board extended the program through December 2014.The repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured stock repurchase programs, and may be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. As part of our stock repurchase program, we have entered into, and we may continue to enter into, structured stock repurchase transactions with financial institutions. These agreements generally require that we make an up-front payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock, within a pre-determined range, at the end of the term of the agreement.  We did not enter into any structured stock repurchase transactions or otherwise purchase any shares of our common stock during the three and nine months ended October 28, 2012. Through October 28, 2012, we have repurchased an aggregate of 90.9 million shares under our stock repurchase program for a total cost of $1.46 billion.  As of October 28, 2012, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $1.24 billion. 37Cash Dividend Program   On November 8, 2012, we announced the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program.  The initial quarterly dividend of 7.5 cents per share is equivalent to 30 cents per share on an annual basis.  The initial cash dividend will be payable on December 14, 2012 to all common stockholders of record at the close of business on November 23, 2012. Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure RequirementsWe believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition, stock repurchase, cash dividends and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then-current stockholders. We also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures, which could harm our business. Factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and, as a result, our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include: ·      decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers’ products;·      inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next-generation products;·      competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices; and·      new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors. We expect to spend approximately $60.0 million to $70.0 million for capital expenditures during the remainder of fiscal year 2013.  For additional factors see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Partners - Our revenue may fluctuate while our operating expenses are relatively fixed, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.”     Contractual Obligations As of October 28, 2012, we had outstanding inventory purchase obligations totaling approximately $596.7 million. There were no other material changes in our contractual obligations from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2012.On June 12, 2012, we pledged a $25.0 million charitable contribution to Stanford Hospital and Clinic, payable over a period of ten years, the net present value of which was recorded at $20.1 million. In addition, in connection with our completion of the acquisition of Icera on June 10, 2011, we have established a retention program in the aggregate amount of approximately $68.0 million to be paid out to Icera employees over a period of four years. Please see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our contractual obligations.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of October 28, 2012, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K 303(a)(4)(ii).Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsPlease see Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements.38ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInvestment and Interest Rate Risk As of October 28, 2012 and January 29, 2012, we had $3.43 billion and $3.13 billion, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We invest in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents, commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises, equity securities, money market funds and debt securities of corporations, municipalities and the United States government and its agencies. As of October 28, 2012, we did not have any investments in auction-rate preferred securities. All of our investments are denominated in United States dollars. All of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “available-for-sale.” Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be other-than-temporary. We may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in securities market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because any debt securities we hold are classified as “available-for-sale,” no gains or losses are realized in our statement of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other-than-temporary. These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity, net of tax. As of October 28, 2012, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately $16.6 million. The financial turmoil that affected the banking system and financial markets and increased the possibility that financial institutions might consolidate or go out of business resulted in a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. There could be a number of follow-on effects from the credit crisis on our business, including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and/or customer, including channel partner, insolvencies; and failure of financial institutions, which may negatively impact our treasury operations. Other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments; interest rates; and cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances. Volatility in the financial markets and economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them. As of October 28, 2012, our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented approximately 58% of our total investment portfolio, while the financial sector accounted for approximately 22% of our total investment portfolio.  Of the financial sector investments, 12% are guaranteed by the U.S. government.  All of our investments are with A/A2 or better rated securities.  If the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by 2% - 5%, fair market values for these investments would decline by approximately $47.9 - $119.8 million. Exchange Rate Risk We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal.  Gains or losses from foreign currency re-measurement are included in “Other income (expense), net” in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and to date have not been significant.  The impact of foreign currency transaction gain (loss) included in determining net income for the third quarter of fiscal years 2013 and 2012 was $(3.0) million and 4.5 million, respectively. During the first nine months of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, the aggregate foreign currency exchange gain (loss) included in determining net income was (1.0) million and $1.8 million, respectively. Currently, revenue and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future.  We may enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are designed to reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. There were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at October 28, 2012.39ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESControls and Procedures  Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on their evaluation as of October 28, 2012, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during our fiscal quarter ended October 28, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.40PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGSPlease see Part I, Item 1, Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our legal proceedings.ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSIn evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Additionally, any one of the following risks could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and PartnersIf we are unable to compete in the markets for our products, our financial results will be adversely impacted.The market for our products is extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings, industry standards continue to evolve and others realize the market potential of mobile and consumer products and services.Our current competitors include:•suppliers of graphics processing units, or GPUs, including chipsets that incorporate three-dimensional, or 3D, graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, Intel Corporation, Matrox Electronics Systems Ltd. and VIA Technologies, Inc.;•suppliers of system-on-chip products that support tablets, smartphones, automotive navigation and other similar devices, such as AMD, Broadcom Corporation, Freescale Semiconductor Inc., Fujitsu Limited, Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., NEC Corporation, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., Seiko Epson Corporation, ST-Ericsson, Texas Instruments Incorporated and Toshiba America Electronic Components, Inc.; •licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc and Imagination Technologies Group plc; and•suppliers of cellular basebands, such as Broadcom, Freescale Semiconductor, GCT Semiconductor Inc., HiSilicon Technologies Co., Ltd., Intel, Marvell, Mediatek, Qualcomm, Renesas Electronics, Samsung, Spreadtrum Communications Inc., ST-Ericsson, Texas Instruments and VIA Technologies, Inc.We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share. Furthermore, competitors with greater financial resources may be able to offer lower prices than us, or they may offer additional products, services or other incentives that we may not be able to match. In addition, many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and greater sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do.Our ability to compete will depend on, among other factors, our ability to:•continue to keep pace with technological developments;•develop and introduce new products, services, technologies and enhancements on a timely basis;•transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries;•obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials; and•succeed in significant foreign markets, such as China and India.If we are unable to compete in our current or new markets, demand for our products could decrease which could cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer.41If and to the extent we offer products in new markets, we may face competition from existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete.  We expect substantial competition from Intel and AMD, both of whom have a strategy of selling platform solutions, including integrating a central processing unit, or CPU, and a GPU on the same chip.  As Intel and AMD continue to pursue platform solutions and integrated CPUs, our business could be negatively impacted.  Despite the use of these integrated CPUs, personal computer, or PC, builders and consumers have continued to embrace discrete GPUs to provide higher performance, or the GPU attach rate. If integrated CPUs offer a more compelling value proposition in the future, our GPU attach rate could decrease, which could adversely affect our business and cause our financial results to decline.Our business results could be adversely affected if the identification and development of new products is delayed or unsuccessful.In order to maintain or improve our financial results, we will need to continue to identify and develop new products and enhancements to our existing products in a timely and cost-effective manner. The process of developing new products and services and enhancing existing products and services is highly complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technology trends could adversely affect our business. We must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our new products and technologies.  It is possible that our development efforts will not be successful and that our new technologies will not result in meaningful revenues.   Even if we introduce new and enhanced products to the market, we may not be able to achieve market acceptance of them in a timely manner.Our ability to successfully develop and deliver new products will depend on various factors, including our ability to:•effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets;•timely complete and introduce new products and technologies;•transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries; and•obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials.We occasionally have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements, and we could experience delays in the future. In addition, in the past, we have been unable to successfully manage product transitions from older to newer products resulting in obsolete inventory. Our failure to successfully develop and introduce new products and technologies or identify new uses for existing or future products could result in rapidly declining average selling prices, reduced demand for our products or loss of market share, any of which could harm our competitive position and cause our revenue, gross margin and overall financial results to suffer.If we are unable to achieve market acceptance and design wins for our products and technologies, our results of operations and competitive position will be harmed.The success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to achieve market acceptance of our new products and enhancements to our existing products and identify and enter new markets. The markets for our product and technologies have been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products, often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results, changes in pricing of dynamic random-access memory devices and other changes in the total system cost of add-in boards, or AIBs, as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions. Broad market acceptance is difficult to achieve and such market acceptance, if achieved, is difficult to sustain due to intense competition and frequent new technology and product introductions.   If we do not successfully achieve or maintain market acceptance for our products and enhancements or identify and enter new markets, our ability to compete and maintain or increase revenues will suffer.Additionally, there can be no assurance that the industry will continue to demand new products with improved standards, features or performance. If our customers, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, original design manufacturers, or ODMs, add-in card and motherboard manufacturers, system builders and consumer electronics companies do not continue to design products that require more advanced or efficient processors and/or the markets do not continue to demand new products with increased performance, features, functionality or standards, sales of our products could decline and the markets for our products could shrink. Decreased sales of our products for these markets could negatively impact our revenue and our financial results.        42We believe achieving design wins, which entails having our existing and future products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by OEMs, ODMs, and AIB and motherboard manufacturers, is an integral part of our future success. Our OEM, ODM, and AIB and motherboard manufacturers' customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year, typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows. Accordingly, when our customers are making their design decisions, our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products in order to be included in our customers' new system configurations. This requires that we:•anticipate the features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand;•incorporate those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting design requirements of our customers;•price our products competitively; and•introduce products to the market within our customers' limited design cycles.If OEMs, ODMs, and AIB and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems, they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration. Therefore, we endeavor to develop close relationships with our OEMs and ODMs, in an attempt to better anticipate and address customer needs in new products so that we will achieve design wins.Our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and be compliant with evolving industry standards. Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers.  If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards, we may not be designed into our customers' product designs.  However, to be compliant with changes to industry standards, we may have to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products which could negatively impact our gross margin or operating results. If we are unable to achieve new design wins for existing or new customers, we may lose market share and our operating results would be negatively impacted.If new consumer products and technologies which incorporate our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business could be negatively impacted.The success of our business also depends on market acceptance of new consumer products and technologies, such as smartphones, smartbooks, tablets and other similar consumer electronics devices, which contain our products.  As markets for these new consumer products emerge, we may encounter new sources of competition as well as customers who have different requirements than those in the PC business.  If market acceptance of such products and technologies is not attained, our ability to compete and maintain or increase revenues will be adversely affected.Our ability to be successful in emerging consumer product markets depends in part on our ability to cultivate new industry relationships in these market segments.  As the number and variety of Internet-connected devices increase, we will need to improve the functionality of our products to succeed in these new markets, which may require significant time and resources on our part to design our products which could negatively impact our business.We depend on foundries to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements, which would harm our business.We do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. Instead, we are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, or TSMC, to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. A substantial portion of our wafers are supplied by TSMC. The foundries, which have limited capacity, also manufacture products for other semiconductor companies, including some of our competitors.  Since we do not have long-term commitment contracts with any of these foundries, they do not have an obligation to provide us with any set pricing or minimum quantity of product at any time except as may be provided in a specific purchase order.   Most of our products are only manufactured by one foundry at a time.  In times of high demand, the foundries could choose to prioritize their capacity for other companies, reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, or increase the prices that they charge us.  If we are unable to meet customer demand due to reduced or eliminated deliveries or have to increase the prices of our products, we could lose sales to customers, which would negatively impact our revenue and our reputation. For example, due to capacity constraint at TSMC of our 28 nanometer Kepler graphics processing units, or GPUs, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, we were unable to fulfill customer demand for our high-end desktop GPU products, and as our sales mix shifted to our mainstream desktop GPU products, revenue and gross margins for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 were negatively impacted compared to the prior quarter. We experienced continued 28 nanometer-supply constraints in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013.43Because the lead-time needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner and achieve initial production could be over a year, we do not have an alternative source of supply for our products. In addition, the time and effort to qualify a new foundry would result in additional expense and diversion of resources, and could result in lost sales, any of which would negatively impact our financial results. We believe that long-term market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with the third-party manufacturers we use to ensure adequate product supply and competitive pricing to respond to customer demand. If our third-party foundries are not able to transition to new manufacturing process technologies or develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process technologies, our operating results and gross margin could be adversely affected.We use the most advanced manufacturing process technology appropriate for our products that is available from our third-party foundries. As a result, we continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating our products to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs. We believe this strategy will help us remain competitive.  Our current product families are manufactured using 0.18 micron, 0.14 micron, 0.13 micron, 0.11 micron, 90 nanometer, 80 nanometer, 65 nanometer, 55 nanometer, 40 nanometer and 28 nanometer process technologies.  Manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development, which could negatively impact our operating expenses and gross margin.We have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes in the past and, consequently, have suffered reduced yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels. We may face similar difficulties, delays and expenses as we continue to transition our new products to smaller geometry processes. Moreover, we are dependent on our third-party manufacturers to invest sufficient funds in new manufacturing processes in order to have ample capacity for all of their customers and to develop the processes in a timely manner. Our product cycles may also depend on our third-party manufacturers migrating to smaller geometry processes successfully and in time for us to meet our customer demands.  Some of our competitors own their manufacturing facilities and may be able to move to a new state of the art manufacturing process more quickly or more successfully than our manufacturing partners.  If our suppliers fall behind our competitors in manufacturing processes, the development and customer demand for our products and the use of our products could be negatively impacted.  If we are forced to use larger geometric processes in manufacturing a product than our competition, our gross margin may be reduced.  The inability by us or our third-party manufacturers to effectively and efficiently transition to new manufacturing process technologies may adversely affect our operating results and our gross margin.We cannot be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors (including those that own their own manufacturing facilities) will not develop such high quality, leading-edge process technologies earlier. If our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies, we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays. If our third-party foundries fall behind our competitors (including those that own their own manufacturing facilities), the development of and customer demand for our products and the use of our products could be negatively impacted.  Additionally, we cannot be certain that our third-party foundries will manufacture our products at prices that are competitive to what our competitors pay.  If our third-party foundries do not charge us competitive prices, our operating results and gross margin will be negatively impacted. Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results and damage our reputation.Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer. Low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure.  We do not know a yield problem exists until our design is manufactured.  When a yield issue is identified, the product is analyzed and tested to determine the cause. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process. Resolution of yield problems requires cooperation by, and communication between, us and the manufacturer. Because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity and our recent transition to a wafer buy model where the costs of our products are based on the price per wafer versus price per functional die, decreases in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers.  Lower than expected yields could potentially harm customer relationships, our reputation and our financial results.   44Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters or catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses, seriously harm our revenue and financial condition, adversely affect our competitive position, increase our costs and expenses, and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In addition, a majority of our principal information technology, or IT, data centers are located in California, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in this geographical area. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China and Korea. Our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. However, in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster or catastrophic event, our revenue, profitability and financial condition could suffer. In late July 2011, Thailand began experiencing severe flooding that has caused widespread damage to the local manufacturing industry. PC manufacturers obtain disk drive components used in their PCs from suppliers with operations in Thailand that were and continue to be severely impacted by the flooding. These PC manufacturers have and expect to continue to experience a short-term reduction in the supply of these disk drive components. As a result, in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 shipments of PCs by some PC manufacturers were reduced, which reduced the demand for our GPUs. In addition, higher disk-drive prices constrained the ability of some PC manufacturers to include a GPU in their systems which also reduced demand for our GPUs and negatively impacted our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012.  A decline in demand in certain end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations. Our customer base includes companies in a wide range of end-user markets, but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the communications- and computer-related industries.  Within these end-user markets, a large portion of our revenue is generated from sales to customers in the cell phone, tablet and PC markets, including professional workstations.  Decline in one or several of these end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition. These declines could be large and sudden. Since PC, cell phone and tablet manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they incorrectly forecast product transitions. In these cases, these manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until their excess inventory has been absorbed, which would have a negative impact on our financial results.We sell our products to a small number of customers and our business could suffer if we lose any of these customers.We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers.  Revenue from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total revenue, was approximately 14% and 12% of our total revenue from one customer for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2013, respectively, and approximately 11% of our total revenue from one customer for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2012.  Sales to our largest customers have fluctuated significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with each customer, as well as the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets, and will likely continue to fluctuate dramatically in the future. Our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers, as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our products. In the future, these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all, purchase fewer products than they did in the past, or alter their purchasing patterns in some other way, particularly because:•substantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty;•our customers may develop their own solutions;•our customers may purchase products from our competitors; or45•our customers may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products.The loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in sales we make to them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.If we fail to appropriately scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers, our business and profitability could be materially and adversely affected.To achieve our business objectives, it may be necessary from time to time for us to expand or contract our operations. In the future, we may not be able to scale our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers. In that event, we may be unable to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected. Conversely, if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly in anticipation of increased demand for our products, and such demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expected, the rate of increase in our costs and operating expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if such demand does not materialize at the pace which we expect, we may be required to scale down our business through expense and headcount reductions as well as facility consolidations or closures that could result in restructuring charges that would materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Because many of our expenses are fixed in the short-term or are incurred in advance of anticipated sales, we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any decrease in customer demand. If customer demand does not increase as anticipated, our profitability could be adversely affected due to our higher expense levels.Our past growth has placed, and any future long-term growth is expected to continue to place, a significant strain on our management personnel, systems and resources. To implement our current business and product plans, we will need to continue to expand, train, manage and motivate our workforce.  All of these endeavors require substantial management effort. If we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations, we may be unable to scale our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities, or conversely, we may scale our business too quickly and the rate of increase in our costs and expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue, either of which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations.Our revenue may fluctuate while our operating expenses are relatively fixed, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.Demand for many of our revenue components fluctuates and is difficult to predict, and our operating expenses are relatively fixed and largely independent of revenue. Therefore, it is difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses in any particular period.  Our operating expenses, which are comprised of research and development expenses and sales, general and administrative expenses, represented 31.9% and 37.1% of our total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2013, respectively, and 33.8% and 34.2% of our total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2012, respectively. Since we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to adjust our operating expenses in a timely manner in response to any unanticipated revenue shortfalls in any quarter. Further, some of our operating expenses, like stock-based compensation expense, can only be adjusted over a longer period of time and cannot be reduced during a quarter.  If we are unable to reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls, our financial results will be negatively impacted.Any one or more of the risks discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or other factors could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Similarly, the results of any quarterly or full fiscal year period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a subsequent quarter or a full fiscal year. As a result, it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. We believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue, gross profit and results of operations.Because our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors, our failure to forecast changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross margin.We are focused on improving our gross margin. Our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors, including: •the mix of our products sold;•average selling prices;46•introduction of new products;•product transitions;•sales discounts;•unexpected pricing actions by our competitors;•the cost of product components; and•the yield of wafers produced by the foundries that manufacture our products.If we do not correctly forecast the impact of any of the relevant factors on our business, there may not be any actions we can take or we may not be able to take any possible actions in time to counteract any negative impact on our gross margin.   In addition, if we are unable to meet our gross margin target for any period or the target set by analysts, the trading price of our common stock may decline. Global economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial results.Our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions poses a continuing risk to our business as consumers and businesses have postponed spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, which has reduced the demand for our products.  Other factors that could depress demand for our products in the future include the European sovereign debt crisis, conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, expectations for inflation, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer and business spending behavior. These and other economic factors have reduced demand for our products in the past and could further harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Our business is cyclical in nature and has experienced severe downturns that have harmed, and may in the future harm, our business and financial results.Our business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry. The semiconductor industry has been adversely affected by many factors, including the global downturn, ongoing efforts by our customers to reduce their spending, diminished product demand, increased inventory levels, lower average selling prices, uncertainty regarding long-term growth rates and underlying financial health and increased competition. These factors, could, among other things, limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue and in turn adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  If our actions to reduce our operating expenses to sufficiently offset these factors when they occur are unsuccessful, our operating results will suffer. Our stock price continues to be volatile and investors may suffer losses.Our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results, announcements by us and our competitors, or uncertainty about current global economic conditions. The stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies' operating performance.In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. For example, following our announcement in July 2008 that we would take a charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated costs and expenses arising from a weak die/packaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation media and communication processor, or MCP, and GPU products and that we were revising financial guidance for our second fiscal quarter of 2009, the trading price of our common stock declined.  In September, October and November 2008, several putative class action lawsuits were filed against us relating to this announcement. Please refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these lawsuits. Due to changes in the potential volatility of our stock price, we may be the target of securities litigation in the future. Such lawsuits could result in the diversion of management's time and attention away from business operations, which could harm our business. In addition, the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation, a ruling against us, or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results.    47Our failure to estimate customer demand properly could adversely affect our financial results.We manufacture our products based on forecasts of customer demand in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers.  As a result, we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize. In forecasting demand, we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include:•changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in the semiconductor industry and/or overall economy;•changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market, expectations for inflation, and energy prices;•if there were a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products;•if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements;•if we fail to estimate customer demand properly for our older products as our newer products are introduced; or•if our competition were to take unexpected competitive pricing actions.Any inability to sell products to which we have devoted resources could harm our business. In addition, cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could adversely affect our gross margin and restrict our ability to fund operations. Additionally, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals. We could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory write-downs and/or a reduction in average selling prices if growth slows or does not materialize, or if we incorrectly forecast product demand, which could negatively impact our financial results.Conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our third-party manufacturing partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production for us meaning that we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill our customers' orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost effective or timely manner. Inability to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, could damage our customer relationships, result in lost revenue, cause a loss in market share, impact our customer relationships or damage our reputation, any of which could adversely impact our business.We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.We have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products and business. Most recently, we completed our acquisition of Icera Inc., an innovator of baseband processors for 3G and 4G cellular phones and tablets.  Such a transaction can involve significant integration challenges and there can be no assurance that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to the acquisition. If we are unable to timely and successfully integrate the acquired operations, product lines and technology of Icera, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition, which could adversely affect our business plans and operating results.We may enter into future acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, in order to complement or expand our current businesses or enter into a new business market. Negotiations associated with an acquisition or strategic investment could divert management's attention and other company resources. Any of the following risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products, or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results:•difficulty in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business;•difficulty in operating in a new or multiple new locations;•disruption of our ongoing businesses or the ongoing business of the company we invest in or acquire;•difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction;48•difficulty in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;•difficulty integrating the target's accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems;•disruption of or delays in ongoing research and development efforts;•diversion of capital and other resources;•assumption of liabilities;•incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results;•diversion of resources and unanticipated expenses resulting from litigation arising from potential or actual business acquisitions or investments;•potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality, architecture and development, or legal and financial contingencies, among other things;•difficulties in entering into new markets in which we have limited or no experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger positions;•incurring significant exit charges if products acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful;•potential inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner, approvals from governmental authorities, which could delay or prevent such acquisitions or investments;•potential delay in customer and distributor purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product offerings; and•impairment of relationships with employees, vendors and customers, or the loss of any of our key employees, vendors or customers or our target's key employees, vendors or customers, as a result of our acquisition or investment.In addition, the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash, shares of our common stock, the issuance of convertible debt securities or a combination of cash, convertible debt and common stock. If we make an investment in cash or use cash to pay for all or a portion of an acquisition, our cash reserves would be reduced which could negatively impact the growth of our business or our ability to develop new products. However, if we pay the consideration with shares of common stock, or convertible debentures, the holdings of our existing stockholders would be diluted. A significant decline in the trading price of our common stock would make the dilution to our stockholders more extreme and could negatively impact our ability to pay the consideration with shares of common stock or convertible debentures. We cannot forecast the number, timing or size of future strategic investments or acquisitions, or the effect that any such investments or acquisitions might have on our operations or financial results.System security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products.  The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. 49We manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and third party business. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our partners or customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our partners and customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. For example, in July 2012, unauthorized third parties gained access to certain user information on our online forums.  We have strengthened security in an effort to minimize future attacks.  However, hackers may continue to target our security controls in the future, and we cannot guarantee that our security measures will be able to prevent future breaches of our website and/or attacks on our products.Portions of our IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systemic failures, systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.Any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, including from foreign customers, could harm our operating results and financial condition.Our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers' businesses, and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy.  We recorded approximately 19% of our accounts receivable balance from one customer at October 28, 2012.Difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. These difficulties are heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. We continue to work directly with more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable from them. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required, we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers, and we may be required to pay higher credit insurance premiums, any of which could adversely affect our operating results. In the future, we may have to record additional reserves or write-offs and/or defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results.We obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to certain customers. As a result of the tightening of the credit markets, we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient. While we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on our accounts receivable, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk or avoid losses, which could harm our financial condition or operating results.We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees which could negatively impact our business.Our future success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain highly qualified key personnel.  The market for key employees in the technology industry can be competitive.  None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement, meaning our relationships with all of our key employees are at will.  The loss of the services of any of our key employees without an adequate replacement or our inability to hire new employees as needed could delay our product development efforts, harm our ability to sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business. In addition, we rely on stock-based awards as a means for recruiting, motivating and retaining highly skilled talent.  If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock or if our stock-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations.     50We are dependent on third parties for assembly, testing and packaging of our products, which reduces our control over our product delivery schedule, product quantity or product quality.Our products are assembled, tested and packaged by independent subcontractors, such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., Amkor Technology, ChipPAC, JSI Logistics, Ltd., King Yuan Electronics Co. and Siliconware Precision Industries Co. Ltd. As a result, we do not directly control our product delivery schedules, product quantity, or product quality.  All of these subcontractors assemble, test and package products for other companies, including some of our competitors.  Since we do not have long-term agreements with our subcontractors, when demand for subcontractors to assemble, test or package products is high, our subcontractors may decide to prioritize the orders of other customers over our orders.  Since the time required to qualify a different subcontractor to assemble, test or package our products can be lengthy, if we have to find a replacement subcontractor we could experience significant delays in shipments of our products, product shortages, a decrease in the quality of our products, or an increase in product cost. Any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture, assembly or testing of our products, which could cause our gross margin to decline. We rely on third-party vendors to supply software development tools to us for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop or enhance new or existing products.We rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements. To bring new products or product enhancements to market in a timely manner, or at all, we need software development tools that are sophisticated enough or technologically advanced enough to complete our design, simulations and verifications.  In the past, we have experienced delays in the introduction of products as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products. In the future, the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools.  Unavailability of software development tools may result in our missing design cycles or losing design wins, either of which could result in a loss of market share or negatively impact our operating results.Because of the importance of software development tools to the development and enhancement of our products, a critical component of our product development efforts is our partnerships with leaders in the computer-aided design industry, including Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and Synopsys, Inc. We have invested significant resources to develop relationships with these industry leaders and have often assisted them in the definition of their new products. We believe that forming these relationships and utilizing next-generation development tools to design, simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3D graphics, communications and networking segments and develop products that utilize leading-edge technology on a rapid basis. If these relationships are not successful, we may be unable to develop new products or product enhancements in a timely manner, which could result in a loss of market share, a decrease in revenue or a negative impact on our operating results.If our products contain significant defects, our financial results could be negatively impacted, our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share.Our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. If any of our products or technologies contains a defect, compatibility issue or other error, we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue.  Such efforts could divert our engineers' attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin. In addition, an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins. Also, we may be required to reimburse customers, including our customers' costs to repair or replace products in the field. A product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive, could damage our reputation, could result in the shifting of business to our competitors and could result in litigation against us. Costs associated with correcting defects, errors, bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results.  During fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded net warranty charges of $466.4 million against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty, repair, return, replacement and other costs arising from a weak die/packaging material set used in certain versions of our previous generation MCP and GPU products used in notebook configurations and shipped after July 2008. Please see the risk entitled “We are subject to litigation arising from alleged defects in our previous generation MCP and GPU products which, if determined adversely to us, could harm our business” for further information regarding this product defect.  51We may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results.If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase.  Our engineering and technical resources included 5,654 and 4,921 full-time employees as of October 28, 2012 and October 30, 2011, respectively.  Research and development expenditures were $284.2 million and $256.5 million for the third quarter of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $849.3 million and $735.7 million for the first nine months of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively.  If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. Research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results. In order to remain competitive, we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development.We are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business.We conduct our business worldwide.  Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third-parties located outside of the United States and other Americas.  We generated 72% and 75% of our revenue for the third quarter of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively, and 75% and 79% of our revenue for the first nine months of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively, from sales to customers outside the United States and other Americas.  As of October 28, 2012, we had offices in 15 countries outside of the United States.  The manufacture, assembly, test and packaging of our products outside of the United States, operation of offices outside of the United States, and sales to customers internationally subjects us to a number of risks, including:•international economic and political conditions, such as political tensions between countries in which we do business;•unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;  •complying with a variety of foreign laws;•differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices;•local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anticorruption laws and regulations;•inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions;•exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; •financial risks such as longer payment cycles, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;•imposition of additional taxes and penalties;•increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits; and•other factors beyond our control such as terrorism, cyber attack, civil unrest, war and diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Avian flu.If sales to any of our customers outside of the United States and other Americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may be negatively impacted.Our international operations in China, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom are subject to many of the above listed risks. Difficulties with our international operations, including finding appropriate staffing and office space, may divert management's attention and other resources, any of which could negatively impact our operating results.52Legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions worldwide. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to ensure compliance with foreign laws, many of these laws and regulations are ambiguous and are often interpreted and enforced in unpredictable ways.The economic conditions in our primary overseas markets, particularly in Asia, may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad. All of our international sales to date have been denominated in United States dollars. Accordingly, an increase in the value of the United States dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies. We anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activities.Our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the capital markets.Our cash equivalent and marketable securities portfolio as of October 28, 2012 consisted of cash and cash equivalents, commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities issued by Government-sponsored enterprises, money market funds and debt securities of corporations, municipalities and the United States government and its agencies. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines, designed to preserve principal, minimize risk, and monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk.  The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes, and a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents, commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities issued by Government-sponsored enterprises, money market funds and debt securities of corporations, municipalities and the United States government and its agencies.Should financial market conditions worsen in the future, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns. In addition, any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and expense to vary from expectations. As of October 28, 2012, we had no material impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio, and although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity, or credit availability, and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired. Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Common Stock and Other Matters We are subject to litigation arising from alleged defects in our previous generation MCP and GPU products which, if determined adversely to us, could harm our business.As of October 28, 2012, we recorded a total cumulative net warranty charge of $475.9 million, of which $466.4 million has been charged against cost of revenue, to cover anticipated customer warranty, repair, return, replacement and other costs arising from a weak die/packaging material set used in certain versions of our previous generation MCP and GPU products shipped after July 2008 and used in notebook configuration. The previous generation MCP and GPU products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities. Certain notebook configurations of these MCP and GPU products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates. Testing suggests a weak material set of die/package combination, system thermal management designs, and customer use patterns are contributing factors for these failures.  We have worked with our customers to develop and have made available for download a software driver to cause the system fan to begin operation at the powering up of the system and reduce the thermal stress on these chips. We have also recommended to our customers that they consider changing the thermal management of the products in their notebook system designs. Although we believe this issue has been nearly fully remediated, we remain committed to fully support our customers in their repair and replacement of these impacted products that fail, and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures.We continue to not see any abnormal failure rates in any systems using NVIDIA products other than certain notebook configurations. However, we are continuing to test and otherwise investigate other products. There can be no assurance that we will not discover defects in other products.In September, October and November 2008, several putative securities class action lawsuits were filed against us, asserting various claims related to the impacted MCP and GPU products.  Such lawsuits could result in the diversion of management's time and attention away from business operations, which could harm our business. In addition, the costs of defense and any damages resulting from this litigation, a ruling against us, or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results.  53          We are a party to other litigation, including patent litigation, which, if determined adversely to us, could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results.We are a party to other litigation as both a defendant and as a plaintiff.  For example, we are engaged in litigation with parties related to our acquisition of 3dfx in 2001. Please refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on this lawsuit. There can be no assurance that any litigation to which we are a party will be resolved in our favor. Any claim that is successfully decided against us may cause us to pay substantial damages, including punitive damages, and other related fees or prevent us from selling or importing certain of our products. Regardless of whether lawsuits are resolved in our favor or if we are the plaintiff or the defendant in the litigation, any lawsuits to which we are a party will likely be expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve. Such lawsuits could also harm our relationships with existing customers and result in the diversion of management's time and attention away from business operations, which could harm our business. Costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation, a ruling against us, or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results.Changes in United States tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could materially impact our business. Currently, a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the United States, and a significant portion of our assets, including employees, are located outside the United States.  United States income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain non-United States subsidiaries, because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries.  Throughout the period of President Obama's administration, the White House has proposed various international tax measures, some of which, if enacted into law, would substantially reduce our ability to defer United States taxes on such indefinitely reinvested non-United States earnings, eliminate certain tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the United States and/or otherwise cause the total tax cost of U.S. multinational corporations to increase. If these or similar proposals are constituted into legislation in the current or future year(s), they could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. Our operating results may be adversely affected if we are subject to unexpected tax liabilities. We are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the United States and throughout the world. Tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for our income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any of the below could cause our effective tax rate to be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals:•the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;•adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;•changes in available tax credits;•changes in stock-based compensation expense;•changes in tax laws, the interpretation of tax laws either in the United States or abroad or the issuance of  new interpretative accounting guidance related to transactions and calculations where the tax  treatment was previously uncertain; and•the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities.  Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of any of the above, our operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws or changes in the interpretation of tax laws.Litigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to enforce our intellectual property rights and the outcome of such litigation could result in substantial costs to us.We expect that as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases and as competition intensifies, the volume of intellectual property infringement claims and lawsuits may increase. We may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us or that we have agreed to indemnify our customers for certain claims of infringement.54An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents, indemnification of customers, payment of lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief.In addition, in the future, we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to: •assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property;•enforce our patents;•protect our trade secrets or know-how; or•determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the propriety rights of others.If we have to initiate litigation in order to protect our intellectual property, our operating expenses may increase which could negatively impact our operating results. Our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third parties' patent or intellectual property, we or one of our indemnified customers may have to seek a license to the third parties' patent or other intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors. If we or one of our indemnified customers is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products.  We may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results.Our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property.We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. We have numerous patents issued, allowed and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as: •the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions;•the location in which our products are manufactured;•our strategic technology or product directions in different countries; and•the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions.Our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved. In addition, any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties. The enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property. Our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business.On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law.  The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law.  These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation.  The United States Patent Office is currently developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act will not become effective until up to 18 months after its enactment.  Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.55Government investigations and inquiries from regulatory agencies could lead to enforcement actions, fines or other penalties and could result in litigation against us.In the past, we have been subject to government investigations and inquiries from regulatory agencies such as the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.  We may be subject to government investigations and receive additional inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future, which may lead to enforcement actions, fines or other penalties.In addition, litigation has often been brought against a company in connection with the announcement of a government investigation or inquiry from a regulatory agency.  Such lawsuits could result in the diversion of management's time and attention away from business operations, which could harm our business. In addition, the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation, a ruling against us, or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results.We are subject to the risks of owning real property.During fiscal year 2009, we purchased real property in Santa Clara, California that includes approximately 25 acres of land and ten commercial buildings.  We also own real property in China and India. We have limited experience in the ownership and management of real property and are subject to the risks of owning real property, including:•the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with mitigating any environmental problems;•adverse changes in the value of these properties, due to interest rate changes, changes in the market in which the property is located, or other factors;•the risk of loss if we decide to sell and are not able to recover all capitalized costs;•increased cash commitments for the possible construction of a campus;•the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with zoning, seismic and other legal or regulatory requirements;•increased operating expenses for the buildings or the property or both;•possible disputes with third parties, such as neighboring owners or others, related to the buildings or the  property or both; and•the risk of financial loss in excess of amounts covered by insurance, or uninsured risks, such as the loss caused by damage to the buildings as a result of earthquakes, floods and or other natural disasters.Expensing employee equity compensation adversely affects our operating results and could also adversely affect our competitive position.Since inception, we have used equity through our equity incentive plans and our employee stock purchase program as a fundamental component of our compensation packages. We believe that these programs directly motivate our employees and, through the use of vesting, encourage our employees to remain with us. We record compensation expense for stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan using the fair value of those awards in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. Stock-based compensation expense was $33.1 million and $33.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $100.9 million for the first nine months of fiscal years 2013 and 2012, related to on-going vesting of equity awards, which negatively impacted our operating results.  To the extent that expensing employee equity compensation makes it more expensive to grant stock options and restricted stock units or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program, we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs. In addition, actions that we may take to reduce stock-based compensation expense that may be more severe than any actions our competitors may implement and may make it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees, which could adversely affect our competitive position as well as our business and operating results. 56We may be required to record a charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, which could negatively impact our operating results.Under U.S. GAAP, we review our amortizable intangible assets and goodwill for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. The carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable assets from acquisitions may not be recoverable due to factors such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry or in any of our business units. Estimates of future cash flows are based on an updated long-term financial outlook of our operations. However, actual performance in the near-term or long-term could be materially different from these forecasts, which could impact future estimates. For example, if one of our business units does not meet its near-term and longer-term forecasts, the goodwill assigned to the business unit could be impaired. We may be required to record a charge to earnings in our financial statements during a period in which an impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined to exist, which may negatively impact our results of operations.Our failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences, including fines, suspension of production, excess inventory, sales limitations, and criminal and civil liabilities.We are subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment, including restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of those products.  Although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations. If we violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at, under or emanating from our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage.Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead, among other chemicals, in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor packaging. There is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of lead-free products may be less favorable compared to lead-based products or that the transition to lead-free products may produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory.There is also a movement to improve the transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals coming from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo. New U.S. legislation includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and procedures regarding a manufacturer's efforts to prevent the sourcing of such “conflict” minerals. The implementation of these requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices. As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict-free metals, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stockholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in our products.Future environmental legal requirements may become more stringent or costly and our compliance costs and potential liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances may harm our business and our reputation.57While we believe that we have adequate internal control over financial reporting, if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines that we do not, our reputation may be adversely affected and our stock price may decline.Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to audit, the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. We have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements. However, the manner in which companies and their independent public accounting firms apply these requirements and test companies' internal controls remains subject to some judgment. To date, we have incurred, and we expect to continue to incur, increased expense and to devote additional management resources to Section 404 compliance. Despite our efforts, if we identify a material weakness in our internal controls, there can be no assurance that we will be able to remediate that material weakness in a timely manner, or that we will be able to maintain all of the controls necessary to determine that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. In the event that our chief executive officer, interim chief financial officer or our independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under Section 404, investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock. Changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards could affect our reported results of operations.We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.  These principles are constantly subject to review and interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions.  Additionally, changes in existing accounting rules or practices, including the possible conversion to unified international accounting standards, could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business.Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or prevent a change in control. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the following:•the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior stockholder approval;•the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent;•a classified Board of Directors, which will become fully declassified from and after our 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders; and•advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals.On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA.58ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDSIssuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesOur Board of Directors has authorized us, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an aggregate maximum amount of $2.7 billion through December 2014. The repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured stock repurchase programs, and may be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. As part of our stock repurchase program, we have entered into, and we may continue to enter into, structured stock repurchase transactions with financial institutions. These agreements generally require that we make an up-front payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock, within a pre-determined range, at the end of the term of the agreement.  We did not enter into any structured stock repurchase transactions or otherwise purchase any shares of our common stock during the three and nine months ended October 28, 2012. Through October 28, 2012, we have repurchased an aggregate of 90.9 million shares under our stock repurchase program for a total cost of $1.46 billion.  As of October 28, 2012, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $1.24 billion. 59ITEM 6.
