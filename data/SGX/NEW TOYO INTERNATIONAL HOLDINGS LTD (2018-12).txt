Our Group and the sustainability of our business are based on 

the same principles: a forward-looking approach that entails 

maximum efficiency and a steadfast focus on quality. This enables 

us to maintain excellent customer satisfaction while also ensuring 

the interest of our stakeholders.

Dear Stakeholders, 

In our view, sustainability rests not only on economic performance but also on the legacy we leave for our 

future generations. To this end, New Toyo’s overall risk strategy sees sound sustainability management, from 

environmental and social to governance matters, as the pedestal of business continuity. In line with our vision, we 

continue to emphasise upholding our reputation in the markets where we operate. As our existing and prospective 

customers are themselves placing greater importance on the sustainability of their supply chains, we aim to 

demonstrate commitment towards sustainability through sound practices. In doing so, we remain compliant with 

local laws and regulations and, as such, maintain good reputation with our communities. With this backdrop to our 

business operations, we strongly embody responsible stewardship of the environment while ensuring employee 

welfare and adherence to all applicable environmental laws and regulations.

Our promise to support sustainability starts at the underlying phases of production, and we work to coordinate 

sustainability throughout our production network, from limiting ecological impacts to improving the prosperity of 

our employees globally.

We believe that environmental sustainability begins with effective planning to limit waste and the utilisation of 

energy and raw materials. As our prosperity hinges on our employees, their security and advancement are key 

focus areas of our efforts. Moreover, we uphold the significance of engaging with and positively influencing  our 

nearby networks through corporate giving and empowerment of local communities. This is particularly pertinent 

given that we have low-cost based production centres situated in ASEAN’s most rapidly developing economies, 

such as Vietnam. 

In essence, our sustainability report is a demonstration of our approach to sustainability, from how we implement 

our strategies into our business practices to how we track performance towards our Key Performance Indicators 

(“KPI”). Further, our drive towards sound sustainability practices bolsters our capacity to engineer sustainable 

growth and returns in the present and future that are stable, strategic and sustainable.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

ABOUT

NEW TOYO

Counting more than 40 years of experience, New Toyo has built a 

reputation as an esteemed value-added supplier of quality products 

and services. We keep abreast of and advance alongside the most 

recent innovations in packaging materials to continue being a 

value-added partner to our customers.

A leading regional supplier and one of the largest players in the provision of high quality specialty packaging 

materials to the tobacco, food and beverage, wine, liquor and cosmetics industries in Asia Pacific, New Toyo 

International Holdings Ltd (“New Toyo”) was founded in 1975 and has been listed on the Mainboard of the 

Singapore Exchange since 4 April 1997. With headquarters in Singapore and employees totalling 1,646 in 

all, our activities are strategically situated in the region to serve both global and local customers. Our strong 

manufacturing base and multiple facilities draw on our strategic locations in four countries, Singapore, Malaysia, 

Vietnam and Dubai, thus offering consistent support to our customers in these markets.

Addressing our customers’ needs and perfecting the quality of our products are the focus of our business.

New Toyo has two core business divisions: 

The Specialty Papers (“SP”) division focuses on the production of laminated and/or coated paper and 

paperboards in reel form or in sheets for customers in the food and beverage, alcohol, tobacco and cosmetics 

industries. These products are mainly used in the packing of cigarettes, food, beverages, wine and liquor, tissue 

boxes, cosmetics, labelling and gift-wrapping.  

The Printed Cartons and Labels (“PCL”) division offers mainly gravure and lithography printing. Gravure 

printing is a specialised high-speed printing process used for the printing of high quality paper prints, mainly for 

cigarette packaging. Lithography or offset printing is mainly used for the supply of folded cartons and labels for 

fast moving consumer goods.

Furthermore, the Group has a trading business that centres on the sale of raw materials, paper products and 

equipment.

high-quality packaging materials

OUR SUSTAINABILITY

 ETHOS

“To do our part to Safeguard our Environment and 

better the lives of Our People and the Communities 

where we Work and Live”

At New Toyo, we have always adopted a progressive 

view in our business direction. We maintain that the 

manner in which we conduct our business, how we 

treat individuals and the effect our business activities 

have on our future generations will define how 

others see New Toyo. We recognise that managing 

sustainability issues is critical to maintaining our 

reputation in the market and our relationships with 

key stakeholders.

Our 

approach 

to sustainability considers 

the entire supply chain, from raw materials and 

conversion to the final delivery to our customers. 

At every stage, we constantly strive for process 

improvements through effective planning. Through 

this, we limit the utilisation of the natural resources 

consumed to produce paper, paper board and 

aluminium foil. 

To recognise the significance of extending our 

sustainability principles throughout our supply 

chain, we expect our suppliers to embody 

the spirit of our Supplier Code of Conduct 

(“Supplier CoC”) in their business conduct. 

The Supplier CoC urges our suppliers to view 

sustainability beyond simply a set of rules to comply 

with and, rather, to view it as an integral underlying 

principle that should guide the conduct of business. 

The Supplier CoC provides guidance on areas such as 

ethics in business dealings, adherence to applicable 

laws and regulations and environmental stewardship. 

On a related note, we are also pleased to report 

that none of our products were banned in any of the 

markets we operate in. 

In essence, we believe that doing the right things in the 

course of business is to also having the right attitude 

and mind-set to maintain ethical and responsible 

behaviour. For further details on how we manage our 

raw materials and engage suppliers, please refer to 

our Materials and Responsible Sourcing sections.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

How We Create Value Sustainably

In our pursuit to deliver quality products and services, we believe in ensuring that sustainability underpins our entire 

supply chain, from the raw materials we use to the distribution of final products to our customers. By integrating 

sustainability throughout our manufacturing process, we aim to create value for our stakeholders through a safe and 

environmentally sound approach. 

1 Our Inputs

Our expertise and capabilities 

Counting more than 40 years of 

experience, New Toyo has built an 

established reputation as a value-

added provider of quality products and 

services. We are committed to upgrading 

our technology and developing our 

employees through thorough training 

programmes to improve productivity. 

Water 

Our manufacturing facilities 

consume lesser water than typical 

manufacturing plants. However, 

as environmental concerns are 

important to New Toyo, we are 

tracking our water consumption 

patterns with a goal of minimising 

water usage where possible. 

Our relationships with customers

A steadfast focus on quality and 

customer service excellence allows us 

to build and nurture trusting, long-term 

relationships with our customers.

Our safety culture

We hold our employees’ safety and 

well-being foremost in all we do by 

implementing policies and procedures 

that aim to minimise potential risks.

Materials we use

Base materials

Through proactive planning, we are able 

to obtain base materials that are closest 

to the dimensions of our final products’ 

specifications. This enables us to reduce 

wastage and as a result, we consume 

lesser natural resources.

Other raw materials 

We always encourage 

our customers to use 

water-based inks as they are 

environmentally friendlier.

2 How We Manage Our  

       Manufacturing Process

People 

Personnel Planning 

This bolsters operational 

efficiency and productivity.

Job Scheduling 

With proper work scheduling, we 

ensure that our staff obtain adequate 

rest before their shifts. Instilling 

healthy work practices improves 

efficiency and our employees’ well-

being and minimises risk of accidents 

and injuries. 

Electricity

Regularly scheduled machine 

maintenance helps decrease 

machine downtime and in turn, 

reduces our carbon footprint. As 

our machineries consume more 

electricity when switching from 

a disconnected to running mode, 

relative to running at a constant 

rate, low machine downtime means 

we minimise our carbon footprint.

3 How We Distribute

On-Time-In-Full 

Delivery

Unnecessary urgent 

deliveries are avoided by 

ensuring that products 

reach customers on time 

and in full, thus reducing 

our environmental 

impact.

Delivery Planning

We maximise 

container capacity by 

coordinating closely 

with our customers. 

This optimises freight 

delivery, which in turn 

reduces our carbon 

footprint.

Value We Create

Strategically Located 

Facilities

We maintain a solid 

manufacturing base with 

strategically located 

facilities in the Asia 

Pacific and Middle East 

regions to enable on-the-

ground support for our 

customers. By locating 

our factories within close 

reach of our customers, 

we cut down on distances 

and travel times for 

product delivery, in turn 

reducing our costs and 

carbon footprint. 

Quality

Our manufacturing plants adhere 

to ISO 9001, thereby ensuring the 

quality of our products. A focus 

on quality reduces consumption. 

By having fewer internal and 

external rejects, we save on the 

materials, energy, transport and 

labour otherwise needed for 

replacement.

Packaging

All products are packaged and 

sealed securely so that quality 

is not affected by exposure to 

the elements during delivery. 

This results in fewer rejects 

by customers and reduces 

consumption of raw materials, 

energy, transport and labour costs 

for the replacement of damaged 

goods.

Waste Management

Waste disposal is handled 

by licensed contractors who 

are registered under the local 

authorities.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

ABOUT

THIS REPORT



We reciprocate our stakeholders’ trust by ensuring that the 

sustainability of our business goes beyond mere regulatory 

compliance. We approach sustainability in line with the practices 

our customers have come to know us by over the last four 

decades: honesty, integrity and a dedication to excellence. 

Our inaugural sustainability report that was published in December 2018, for financial year 2017, excluded our 

Dubai operation as its manufacturing activities only began in late 2017. With the Dubai plant fully operational in 

2018, it is now material to include it in this year’s report. With this inclusion, the reporting scope for financial year 

2018 now covers our operations in Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and Dubai. 

The structure of our sustainability report follows the order of importance of environmental, social, and governance 

(“ESG”) topics as perceived by our stakeholders. Detailed information on our material ESG topics and how our 

operations impact society and the environment is covered in the following sections. 

This sustainability report focuses on the SP division, which is representative of our material ESG topics. Our 

PCL division is covered in a separate report done by our subsidiary, Tien Wah Press Holdings (“TWPH”), as 

TWPH is listed on Bursa Malaysia and subject to Bursa’s sustainability reporting requirements. Our Trading 

division remains excluded from this report as its business activity is generally limited to being an intermediary 

in the buying and selling of materials, thus having minimal sustainability impact. We will continue to review the 

materiality of the trading division for inclusion in our sustainability reporting as appropriate. 

Our stakeholder engagement exercise emphasises stakeholder inclusiveness, completeness and balanced 

reporting and was designed to obtain feedback on our material ESG topics from different stakeholders. For 

more details, please refer to our Materiality section on page 14. 

In line with best practices, we have chosen the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards framework for 

our sustainability reporting. The framework provides clear specifications to ensure the accuracy of our report 

and allows our performance to be benchmarked against peers. In this respect, the sustainability report is also 

prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. For this year’s report, we have not sought 

external assurance. External assurance will be considered as our sustainability reporting evolves. At present, 

we work to embed sustainability throughout our organisation and to progressively integrate key sustainability-

related metrics into our management systems.

To ensure a complete and transparent account of all aspects of the Group’s performance across environmental, 

social and economic domains, this report should be read in conjunction with our latest annual report, which 

provides details of our financial performance and our approach to corporate governance and risk management. 

Please refer to our 2018 annual report at newtoyo.com for further information. 

This report uses standard units of measurement. Conversion factors, where required and applicable, as well as 

the computational basis for certain metrics, are explained in the respective sections.

For any questions regarding this report, you may reach us at enquiry@newtoyo.com.

OUR

APPROACH

In recognition of the rising importance of sustainability among corporations globally, we established our 

Sustainability Reporting Committee (“SRC”) in 2017. The SRC is responsible for directing and monitoring the 

development of New Toyo’s sustainability policies and practices. The Board is responsible for New Toyo’s 

overall sustainability management and is kept abreast of sustainability matters through the SRC’s updates 

to the Group Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. This enables the Board to ensure that 

sustainability is carried out appropriately at all levels of the organisation. All identified material ESG topics are 

taken into consideration by the Board in New Toyo’s strategic planning. 

Our solid governance structures and vigorous approach to risk management underpin our approach to 

sustainability. Please refer to the Corporate Governance Statement in our 2018 Annual Report for further 

information on our corporate governance structures, practices and policies.

RISK MANAGEMENT

Our Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) framework allows us to maximise potential opportunities, 

and manage and minimise the adverse effects of strategic, financial, operational and compliance risks. 

Sustainability topics are consequently detected whenever these types of risks arise. As each unit has 

different operating environments, the conformity to ERM in spirit and substance, rather than in form, is 

emphasised, while addressing the special needs or unique situations that each unit might face. Please refer 

to the Risk Management and Internal Controls section in our 2018 Annual Report for further information on 

our practices and policies.

OUR

APPROACH

ETHICAL STANDARDS

Upholding ethical standards is important to us as ethical business practices build trust among customers, 

suppliers and investors, further contributing to the strength of our supply chain and long-term sustainability. 

We aim to avoid any violations of ethical standards, including those relating to anti-competitive behaviour, 

anti-trust and monopoly, and customer privacy. To guarantee that our employees reflect ethical standards at 

all times, we require every employee to acknowledge that they have read and understood and abide by our 

Code of Conduct (“Code”). The Code is a fundamental feature of each new employee’s orientation training. 

It covers important aspects of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, such as policies 

regarding insider trading, fraud and anti-counterfeiting. These policies underpin our anti-corruption ethos as 

emphasised in the Code. 

Supplementary to the Code, our whistle-blowing policy provides a mechanism for employees to raise 

concerns over possible improprieties in financial reporting or other matters. This policy is made familiar to all 

employees upon onboarding. 

All employees are encouraged to report in good faith any concerns they may have to New Toyo’s designated 

receiving officer, who is also the chairman of the Audit Committee. This open channel of communication 

and its respect for anonymity further exemplify our pledge to create a workplace where employees feel 

comfortable to express their concerns without fear.   

Our Employee Handbook sets out guidelines for the proper conduct of all New Toyo employees, 

including policies and procedures for the protection of data and confidentiality. The handbook is explicitly 

acknowledged by each new hire when joining the company. 

In 2018, there were zero incidents of non-compliance with laws and regulations in social and economic areas. 

Further, there were no complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy or losses of customer data, and 

no legal actions were brought against New Toyo for anti-competitive behaviour or anti-trust and monopoly 

practices. It is our goal to maintain this perfect record going forward as ensuring compliance reduces our risk 

exposure in terms of reputational damage.

Creating stable, long-term value for our stakeholders has always been our highest priority. Incorporating 

sustainability governance across our operating environments allows us to better integrate economic, 

environmental and social performance, driven by our core values and culture, as exemplified by our top 

management.





SOCIO-ECONOMIC COMPLIANCE

TRACK RECORD

0 incidents of non-compliance with socio-economic

BuSINESS CONTINuITY MANAGEMENT

At New Toyo, we view sustainability as not just an initiative but an ongoing movement to effectively integrate 

crisis management with community, environmental and business sustainability to minimise the impact 

disasters have on our people and the local community and ensure minimal disruption in our supply to our 

customers. 

Our business continuity management addresses the measures undertaken to:

•	

Ensure	prioritisation	of	our	employees’	safety	and	well-being	

•	

Limit	further	damage	to	the	factory,	personnel	and	surrounding	areas	through	containment	actions

•	

Minimise	damage	to	production	equipment	in	the	event	of	disasters,	such	as	a	fire

•	

Minimise	disruption	to	factory	resources	and	operations	

•	

Re-channel	our	deliveries	to	other	production	facilities	in	the	event	that	our	customers	encounter	a	loss	

of site 

•	

Manage	real-time	information	sharing	related	to	emergency	response	and	safety	

The robustness of this plan is tested throughout the year to ensure its continued viability and effectiveness.

OUR

APPROACH

MATERIALITY

Going beyond traditional financial reporting, we endeavour to communicate material information to our 

stakeholders on matters which influence their decisions about New Toyo or affect our long-term financial 

performance; therefore, stakeholders’ views are considered in identifying the material ESG topics. 

As part of our materiality assessment exercise last year, we conducted a survey through an independent 

sustainability consultant, and the results show that our stakeholders were satisfied with how we are 

managing the material topics. This survey was a formal process where: 

•	

Topics	were	first	identified	and	approved	by	the	Sustainability	Reporting	Committee	

•	

Stakeholders	were	asked	to	rank	the	topics	in	terms	of	significance	to	them

•	

Material	 ESG	 topics	 were	 identified	 following	 a	 materiality	 assessment	 workshop	 attended	 by	 the	

Board and top management.

It is based on these ESG topics and guided by the GRI Principles that New Toyo has aligned the 2018 

sustainability report.

We aim to develop targets for our material topics ranked as High Priority and to implement the necessary 

control mechanisms to measure our performance over time against these targets. Pushing ahead, we will 

evaluate our performance on material ESG topics and submit the results in the subsequent sustainability 

report for financial year 2019.

The materiality of ESG topics will be reviewed regularly to ensure their continued relevance to current 

business environment.

OUR

CUSTOMERS

Word of mouth marketing is recognised for its 

demonstration of genuine encounters between the 

company and its customers. As a global brand, we take 

pride in providing an excellent customer experience. By 

keeping our customers highly satisfied, we distinguish 

ourselves from our competitors and place ourselves in 

the forefront of new opportunities. Customer visits and 

audits of our facilities enable customers to have a better 

understanding of our people and our production activities. 

Excellent customer experience begins with initial contact, 

followed by understanding our customers’ needs, on time 

delivery of top quality products and acclaimed after sales 

support. 

While our goal is to provide uninterrupted product 

supply to our customers, there are scenarios where 

extenuating circumstances may impact our operations, 

as well as those of our customers, in turn affecting our 

ability to deliver to the intended destination. Floods 

and earthquakes and local adverse conditions, such as 

political instability, may create situations that result in a 

short-term impairment to the supply chain. By working 

closely with our customers, we implement safety 

measures to eliminate or alleviate the risks associated with 

such externalities. Our business continuity management 

system is regularly evaluated to ensure its continued 

relevance and to enable the efficient activation of back up 

contingency sites within the Group or for our customers’ 

supply chain. This may also entail securing alternative 

sourcing of raw materials and redistributing goods to 

continue supply. 

Where there is feedback from our customers, the 

quality control department will take charge and 

coordinate with relevant departments to conduct a joint 

investigation to identify the root causes of the matter 

and suggest appropriate corrective and preventive 

measures to avoid recurrence. 

We strive for engagement, alignment and responsiveness 

to our customers. Coincidentally, this is also a material 

ESG topic ranked highly by our stakeholders. Among 

other methods, we engage customers through our annual 

customer satisfaction survey. In 2018, we received an 

average rating of 4 out of 5 for our SP division on both 

product quality and the quality of packaging for products 

supplied.

OUR

PEOPLE



OuR EMPLOYEES

At the end of 2018, our staff strength stood at 538 employees within our SP division. The demographic 

profile of our workforce between male and female employees was 428 and 110 respectively. The majority of 

personnel are assigned to the production floor to manage physical activities in the factory. Inadvertently, the 

nature of the work appeals more to males as is prevalent in the manufacturing industry (see Figure 1.1). 

Other than two female part-time employees, all our staff are full-time employees. 41.3% of our employees are 

hired on a fixed-term or temporary contract basis of one to three years. 33.6% of our workforce in Malaysia 

and 100% of our workforce in Vietnam are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Safeguarding 

workers’ rights is a key priority for us, and SA8000 standards are adopted for our Vietnam operations. This 

encourages the development, maintenance and application of socially acceptable practices in the workplace.

Total Employees by Employment Contract by Gender and Region (Figure 1.1)

At New Toyo, we believe that optimal performance on the part 

of our employees guarantees the success of our organisation. In 

order to maintain the inspiration of our employees, we persistently 

work to instil a culture of inclusiveness, provide ongoing training 

and development, and build strong positive relationships.

EMPLOYEE ATTRITION AND NEW HIRE RATES

In order to retain our valuable employees, we offer good career progression and competitive remuneration 

packages. This year, our new hire and employee turnover rates were 23.4% and 21.2% respectively. The 

increase in new hires was mainly due to the inclusion of Dubai in our reporting scope. 

The overall employee turnover rate decreased from 24.2% (in 2017) to 21.2% in 2018. The reduction in 

turnover mainly came from Malaysia where there was a smaller number of employees leaving the operations. 

14.7% of the employee turnover rate (see Figure 1.3) was attributed to Vietnam operations, down from 16.3% 

the year before. 79 employees left our Vietnam operations, of which 64.6%, or 51 employees, were aged 

below 30. In 2018, the International Labour Organisation (“ILO”) reported that young graduates of university 

or higher levels are placing greater importance on the matching between their qualifications and jobs held1. 

However, there is a gap observed between occupations desired by graduates and the labour demands 

from industry, with only 13.4% of Vietnam’s employment trends attributed to demands for PMETs2, with a 

significant percentage (47.1%) favouring manual workers and machinery assemblers/operators. According 

to ILO’s employment outlook for 2018, labour trends in Vietnam are still prevailing, i.e. the match between 

qualifications and jobs held is becoming increasingly important to young graduates of university or higher 

levels, driving them to “wait for the right job”3.

OUR

PEOPLE

DIVERSITY AND EQuAL OPPORTuNITY

We actively promote a workplace environment that is inclusive of and respects every individual, regardless 

of age, gender, ethnicity, nationality or sexual orientation. New hires and current employees are evaluated 

based on merit, qualifications and job-related performance. We greatly value feedback and ideas from our 

employees, regardless of rank, and emphasise fostering an environment that enables us to attract, retain and 

engage a diverse pool of talent. 

At New Toyo, we believe that our business is more resilient when we have good understanding of 

the changing needs of our supply chain. As innovation is driven by our diverse team, we encourage our 

employees to share insights in a safe, comfortable and flexible environment. By embracing diversity and 

inclusion in our business, we also improve our ability to better engage with and understand our customers’ 

needs based on their differing social, ethnic and geographical backgrounds.  





TARGET

While we actively pursue workforce gender parity, we acknowledge that the 

nature of our business tends to attract more male than female workers. With 

respect to our efforts towards a practical target on this material ESG, our 

committment to employee diversity is evidenced by the increase in female 

employees and recruitment in the older age bracket in 2018. We will continue 

to strive towards a gender and age diverse workforce.

ANTI-DISCRIMINATION AND 

HARASSMENT-FREE ENVIRONMENT

New Toyo is committed to an atmosphere free of 

hostility that is respectful of all individuals. Any form 

of discrimination or harassment is not tolerated 

and all allegations are taken seriously, with strict 

disciplinary procedures in place in the event of any 

incident. Discrimination includes but is not limited to 

that of age, ancestry, marital status, national origin, 

race, religion, gender or veteran status. Harassment 

includes but is not limited to abusive, insulting or 

offensive actions, including unwelcome requests 

for sexual favours, sexual advances and speech 

containing sexual comments. 

GRIEVANCE MECHANISM

Employees who are subject to any form of 

discrimination, harassment or witness a colleague 

being subjected to such treatment are encouraged 

to contact our Group legal department immediately. 

The identity of the reporting party will be kept 

strictly confidential. We explicitly hold our managers 

responsible for promptly advising the company’s 

senior management or our Human Resources 

department of any possible harassment cases that 

come to their attention. These policies are also 

reflected in our Employee Handbook, Recruitment 

Policy and Guidelines on Selection and Hiring. 

Human Resources actively monitors our recruitment 

processes to ensure they are not discriminatory 

and provides statistical data reporting to the Group 

Assistant HR &amp; Admin Manager on a quarterly basis. 

There were no reported incidents of discrimination 

during 2018.

TARGET

Our 2019 Target is zero 

discrimination incidents.

OUR

PEOPLE

TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT

A fulfilling professional career and lifelong learning are cornerstones of our workplace philosophy. At New 

Toyo, we endeavour to facilitate an environment where individuals can thrive professionally, continually 

providing opportunities for skills upgrading and training. Training programmes for career development 

are organised externally or in-house throughout the year in order for our employees to excel in their jobs 

and reach their fullest potential within our organisation. To further emphasise our commitment, we provide 

financial assistance and/or subsidise external courses for employees who desire to enhance their existing 

skillsets or learn new skills.

Where possible, we carry out internal promotions of those employees who have demonstrated potential 

and have the relevant skills to fill vacant positions instead of recruiting externally. The appraisal and 

profiling process actively identifies talents for future leadership roles on an ongoing basis. At New Toyo, we 

place a significant focus on human capital development as we recognise that it is crucial to planning and 

implementing our growth strategies. 

OPEN COMMuNICATION 

Our performance evaluation system provides an avenue for two-way feedback between our employees and 

their reporting officers. This performance evaluation system offers a way to recognise and reward employees 

for their contributions and motivate them toward performance improvement and career development.

Average hours of Training by Gender and Employee Category (Figure 1.4)

TARGET

We will continue to explore ways to encourage learning 

and assist our employees in harnessing their talents for 

their own professional development, which will ultimately 

benefit our organisation. For 2019, the focus is on 

increasing training hours for the non-clerical group.

Injury and Occupational Disease Rates

We continue to drive good workplace safety culture through awareness

Work-Related Fatalities

We aim to maintain a track record of zero work-related fatalities.

This being New Toyo’s second sustainability report and for comparability, we continue to report in alignment 

with the 2016 version of the GRI 403 standard on Occupational Health and Safety. Our goal is to work 

towards reporting in alignment with the updated 2018 GRI 403 standard on Occupational Health and Safety 

by the time we publish our sustainability report for financial year 2020. This includes working towards putting 

in place the mechanisms needed to track “high-consequence work related injuries”.

New Toyo has a robust risk management system in place and regularly reviews the effectiveness of the 

system to ensure it remains relevant and is able to respond to situations, including those relating to health 

and safety. Please refer to the Risk Management section in the report for further information.  

Health and safety rank as top priorities as most of our workforce are based in factory settings and operations 

involve a degree of risk. We thus have policies in place which objectively assess and reduce potential 

risks by keeping them to a minimum, both during and prior to the start of operations. We comply with all 

industry regulations and have a systematic approach to prevent safety breaches and promote a culture of 

safety awareness. This involves treating health and safety like any other critical business activity with regular 

reporting, appraisals and improvements.

Employees are required to carry out their work in a safe manner, without causing harm to themselves or 

others, and to report any potentially unsafe situation immediately. They are required to observe and follow all 

safety and environmental regulations given in the operation instructions, including the use of necessary safety 

equipment where applicable. 

It is our core imperative to provide a safe and accident-free work environment for our employees. While 

it is impossible to fully eliminate every workplace risk, such as cuts, bruises and sprains, we take every 

precaution to minimise or reduce workplace accidents.  Accordingly, refresher trainings to reiterate our safety 

protocols are conducted to remind our employees of the importance of adhering to safety procedures at all 

times for their safety and well-being.

Our low absentee rates are a testament to our efforts to engage with and develop our employees.

System of rules applied in recording and reporting accident statistics: 

(Additional information: We do not have other workers besides employees.)

1. 

For 2018, we have tracked Occupational Health and Safety performance in accordance with the 

metrics prescribed by Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower, in line with industry practice. 2017 rates are 

presented using the same metrics for purposes of comparison against 2018 rates.

2. 

Accident statistics are recorded and reported according to the Ministry of Manpower, the Occupational 

Safety and Health Malaysia and the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points for Singapore, Malaysia 

and Vietnam respectively. As such, aggregation is not meaningful.

3. 

Minor injuries are excluded in ‘non-fatal workplace injuries’ for all regions except Malaysia. Lost days 

are based on medical leave days for all regions except Vietnam. Medical leave days are based on 

scheduled workdays for all regions except Malaysia, which is based on calendar days. ‘Lost days’ 

count begins on the day of the incident for all countries except Singapore and Dubai, which begins on 

the day after the incident.

ENVIRONMENT









































































































































































































































































We uphold that every association globally has an 

obligation 

towards 

ecological 

stewardship. 

We 

acknowledge the value of environmental issues and 

follow all local environmental laws. We believe that 

long-term sustainable development requires us to 

consider all input from stakeholders and to limit the 

environmental impact of our activities. 

In 2018, there were no incidents of non-compliance 

with environmental laws and regulations, such as those 

concerning air toxins, effluents and waste. We intend 

to keep up this impeccable record as we continue to 

develop our business. 

To guarantee that our efforts in improving efficiency 

are quantifiable, KPIs are set for all relevant business 

units, covering materials utilisation, work scheduling, 

machine upkeep and staffing, to support efficiency at 

all times. 

Our machineries consume more electricity when 

switching from a disconnected to running mode. We 

effectively plan our manufacturing cycles to decrease 

unnecessary starts and stops. Regularly scheduled 

machine maintenance helps decrease machine 

downtime and reduces our carbon footprint. Further, 

we encourage our customers to utilise water-based 

inks as they are more environmentally friendly. 

As a whole, we continually examine our internal 

processes to ensure the responsiveness of our 

environmental policies and programmes.

For our annual Sustainability Report, we have chosen 

the eco-friendly option of e-distribution. A copy of 

this report and our future Sustainability Reports 

are available for download from our website at:

WATER

Water scarcity is a pressing worldwide issue, including in tropical environments such as Malaysia and 

Singapore where we operate. Water has not been identified as a material issue as New Toyo’s operations 

are not as water intensive as those of other heavy industries. However, as environmental considerations 

are important to New Toyo and as New Toyo has operations in water scarce countries (Dubai), we are 

nevertheless monitoring our water usage and aim to minimise water usage wherever possible. For the sake of 

comparability, this being only the second report published by New Toyo, we continue to report in alignment 

with the 2016 version of the GRI 303 standard on Water. We are working towards transitioning and reporting 

in alignment with the updated 2018 GRI 303 standard on Water And Effluents by the time we publish our 

sustainability report for financial year 2020.

Across our operations, we withdraw water only from municipal water supplies. The total volume of water 

drawn in 2018 increased to 33,194 cubic metres, from 23,131 cubic metres in 2017. This was mainly due to 

increased production in Malaysia and Vietnam and the commencement of operations in Dubai.

MATERIALS

While our products are made from pre-processed raw materials and we do not process pulp, we are aware that 

raw materials used for the production of paper do leave an environmental footprint that can be critical to local 

communities. We are thus committed to contributing to resource conservation.

As a responsible manufacturer, we adhere to the principles encapsulated in Our Approach and Our Sustainability 

Ethos and are proactive in reducing our impact through effective planning and devotion to excellence. By 

prioritising product quality, we contribute to a responsible use of materials in our factories. By minimising the 

number of rejects (both internally and from our customers), we use less material, energy, labour, transportation and 

limit such costs that would otherwise be incurred in replacing these products. This enables us to reduce wastages 

and achieve the maximum operational efficiency that benefits our customers, shareholders and the environment. 

We aim to use recycled paper cores to package our materials wherever possible. This is in line with our approach 

to being more environmentally friendly. In 2018, 12.1% of input materials were paper cores made from recycled 

materials. In our processes, we also generate materials which are recyclable. 3,909 metric tonnes of scrap 

materials were sent for recycling during 2018.

ENERGY AND GREENHOuSE GAS EMISSIONS

Our commitment to operational excellence and efficiency relies on lowering our energy consumption and 

reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Energy efficiency and the use of renewable fuel sources help us contribute 

to global and national efforts to mitigate climate change. This and subsequent sustainability reports are welcome 

opportunities to share our headline figures and trend data as we continue to work on our carbon footprint.

Our internal Energy Conservation Policy and Procedure, published since 2011, is mandatory reading for all 

employees at New Toyo’s headquarters. The policy provides guidelines to encourage our colleagues to conserve 

energy. The guidelines include setting air conditioning systems to 24°C and reducing energy consumption where 

possible, such as by keeping doors closed, turning off lights and enabling the power management features 

of personal computers. With the help of this policy, our employees are able to support us in our endeavour to 

improve our energy and emissions profile.

Our manufacturing and distribution processes are also continually optimised to reduce our carbon footprint, for 

example, ensuring containers are loaded to their full safe capacity, whenever feasible. Our energy intensity for 

2018 was 457 kilojoules per dollar revenue. We will continue our efforts to further improve this measure of our 

operational efficiency.

Our energy intensity calculations include fuel5 and electricity consumed within the organisation, with electricity 

consumption being derived from our electricity bills. Fuel sources include diesel and the biomass system (using 

wood compressed tablets), which is considered an environmentally friendly source of energy. 

We encourage the acquisition of energy efficient products whenever possible.

OuR COMMuNITY ENGAGEMENT

In 2017, we pledged a S$1 million cash donation to the National Heart Centre Singapore (“NHCS”) over 

a period of two years in celebration of our 20th anniversary as a publicly listed company. The balance of 

S$0.5 million was disbursed in 2018. To honour our donation pledge to NHCS, Mr Heng Swee Keat, Minister 

for Finance, inaugurated the NHCS Council of Patrons to recognise donors who have been transformative 

through their gifts to the NHCS Heart To Heart Fund. Our non-executive chairman, Mr Yen Wen Hwa, was 

recognised with “Patron” status on behalf of New Toyo. This donation will be used for medical research 

funding advancements in cardiovascular medicine, enhanced patient care, education and clinical research 

that will continue to benefit the community.

Vietnam is progressively becoming a developed nation, yet issues of poverty are still prevalent in the country. 

As we further our interests in Vietnam, we aim to contribute to poverty alleviation by providing housing 

in the local provinces of An Giang, Ben Tre, Can Tho and Long An. To this end, we contributed VND175 

million (S$10,245) in 2018 in the form of a cash donation to the Vietnam Red Cross Society. We believe that 

providing proper housing and better living conditions gives our beneficiaries a chance to seek employment so 

as to improve their lives and those of their families. 

We additionally made an RMB1 million (S$203,640) donation to Xiamen Haicang District Education 

Foundation, an organisation that promotes the development of education in Xiamen Haicang and facilitates 

numerous public welfare projects in the Haishu District Education System.
