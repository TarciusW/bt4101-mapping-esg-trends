At Delfi, we believe that our purpose is to sustainably create 

value for our stakeholders. Our employees. Our community. 

Our customers. Our consumers. Our investors. Delfi has been 

in existence for 67 years, and since our humble beginnings in 

1952, we have been creating value by creating jobs, livelihood 

and profits, producing enjoyable products and paying taxes. 

Value creation is our primary responsibility, which we intend 

to fulfil for many generations to come. In creating value for 

the present, Delfi believes in being responsible and acting 

responsibly for the needs and aspirations of future generations. 

The Board is pleased to present Delfi Limited’s third Sustainability 

Report, 

which 

illustrates 

Delfi’s 

commitment 

towards 

sustainability to our stakeholders. At Delfi, we firmly support 

the United Nations’ view that “Sustainable development is 

‘development that meets the needs of the present without 

compromising the ability of future generations to meet their 

own needs’.”1 Businesses play a key role in advancing global 

sustainable development. As such, we are committed to our 

corporate social responsibility and sustainability mission, as we 

seek to embrace the needs of both the communities we work 

in and our customers, whilst at the same time caring for the 

environment and acting in the interests of our stakeholders.

The Board considers sustainability a core part of Delfi’s strategy 

and works closely with Management in determining the material 

environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) concerns which 

are embodied in our Sustainability Foundation. The Board 

also plays a crucial role in overseeing the management and 

monitoring of the material ESG concerns.

In complementing Delfi’s customary and regulatory financial 

and corporate governance disclosures in our Annual Report, 

our Sustainability Report focuses on the ESG aspects of Delfi’s 

organisational performance in accordance with the Singapore 

Exchange Limited (“SGX”) Listing Rules 711A and 711B for 

sustainability reporting. Sustainability reporting enables Delfi 

to strategically review our business in the context of our 

material sustainability impact, alongside a phased disclosure 

of our performance with insights into the opportunities and 

challenges ahead.

At the bedrock of our organisation, are the four key sustainability 

pillars of social, environmental, economic and governance 

which together encapsulate our approach to sustainability. 

With the conviction of growing with our communities and the 

world, the overarching concept of sustainable value creation 

underpins all that we do. Akin to the cocoa tree, sustainable 

growth can be achieved when both our internal and external 

environment offers an optimal condition for us to thrive. Our 

key stakeholders are the identified people and groups that 

can significantly affect or be significantly affected by our 

organisation. As we flourish, our influence and impact on our 

stakeholders widens as well. The challenge therein, is for us to 

consistently propagate the fruits of our labour through value 

creation, meeting their needs and expectations.

own needs’.” Businesses play a key role in advancing global sustainable development. As such, 

we are committed to our corporate social responsibility and sustainability mission, as we seek 

to embrace the needs of both the communities we work in and our customers, whilst at the 

same time caring for the environment and acting in the interests of our stakeholders. The report 

provides an overview of the progress that Delfi has made towards achieving material sustainability 

throughout our business.

Our Four Sustainability Pillars are the themes of social,

and shape our sustainability mission. During the year, we 

have reviewed and determined the relevance of the Group’s 

existing material sustainability matters and our key stakeholders 

within each of these Four Sustainability Pillars. Our material 

sustainability matters embodied in the Four Sustainability Pillars 

comprise all the goals and initiatives necessary to consolidate 

our sustainability foundation (“Sustainability Foundation”). This

Delfi is one of South East Asia’s leading players in branded chocolate confectionery. Headquartered 

in Singapore and listed on the Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange Limited (“SGX”) since 

2004, our principal activities are marketing and distribution of our own brands of chocolate 

confectionery products in our core markets namely Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore and 

Malaysia. In addition to our own products we also market and distribute a broad portfolio of 

reputable agency brands to leverage on our multi-layered distribution networks.

Our business is supported by two manufacturing facilities located in Indonesia and the Philippines. 

Our network comprises third-party distributors, sub-distributors and wholesalers and extends 

across a wide range of traditional and modern trade retail channels – from corner shops and 

mini-marts, to supermarkets and hypermarkets. Delfi has been in existence for 67 years, and 

since our humble beginnings in 1952, we have been creating value for all our stakeholders by 

creating jobs, livelihood and income. Value creation is our primary responsibility, which we intend 

to fulfil for many generations to come.

OUR BRANDS 

&lt;102-2&gt; &lt;102-7&gt;

Our main product categories are moulded chocolate, dragées, 

enrobed wafers, wafers and biscuits. We have a portfolio 

of over 11 master brands and more than 40 sub-brands that 

extend across a broad spectrum of categories in the chocolate 

confectionery market. 

Our established portfolio of brands in Indonesia includes 

“SilverQueen”, “Ceres” and “Selamat”, which were introduced 

in the 1950’s and “Delfi” in the 1980’s. In the Philippines, our 

flagship brands are “Goya” and “KnickKnacks”, which were 

introduced in the 1950’s and the 1980’s respectively. With 

our longstanding presence and legacy in these markets, our 

chocolates have delighted many generations of Indonesians 

and Filipinos. To complement our current portfolio of brands, 

in 2018, we acquired the exclusive and perpetual trademark 

rights to the “Van Houten” brand name for consumer chocolate 

products for markets in Asia, excluding India, Korea and the 

Middle East.

Social 

Our employees, customers and consumers

As at end 2019, we have a workforce 

of 2,775 in the Delfi family, with a 

ratio of 57 Male to 43 Female.

 

With respect to occupational health 

and safety, we achieved our target of 

zero incidents resulting in fatalities 

in FY2019 and are in the midst of 

migrating to ISO45001 certification. 

 

We are also proud to share that our 

products are now free from artificial 

trans-fats.

Environment

Management of our water consumption, waste and effluents

This year, we achieved a 1% reduction in 

our overall water per unit of production 

output and a 10% reduction in overall 

waste per unit of production output.

On a per metric ton basis, the total 

volume of water discharged was  

1.44 m3 per metric ton (‘MT’) which was 

an increase of 5% from the prior year. 

The increase was largely due to the 

collection of rainwater in addition to 

processed water, which flowed through 

our wastewater treatment plant.

Economic

Compliance with import, export and trade regulations

At Delfi, we believe that our 

purpose is to sustainably create 

value for all our stakeholders.

We continue to achieve our 

target of zero incidents of non-

compliance with applicable import, 

export and trade regulations.

Governance

Supplier engagement and assessment

With the launch of our 

Supplier Self-Assessment 

Program in 2018, about 86% 

of our new suppliers had 

undergone this assessment 

which allows us to evaluate 

them on their compliance, 

as well as, management of 

social and environmental 

aspects of their business.

PROFILE OF OUR WORKFORCE 

&lt;102-7&gt; &lt;102-8&gt;

People are at the heart of our organisation. As of 31 December 

2019, we had a total of 3,836 employees across Singapore, 

Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia, of which 2,775 were 

hired on a permanent contract basis. The average length of 

service of our permanent staff is about 9 years. We hire based 

on merit and are committed to upholding fair employment 

practices. Any form of discrimination has no place in our 

organisation and we believe strongly in providing our people 

with equal opportunities and benefits for them to reach their 

full potential. We are compliant with all relevant labour laws and 

regulations in the countries in which we operate. Due to the 

nature of the manufacturing industry, a large number of roles 

tend to be more physical, which explains the higher percentage 

of males within our workforce. The semi-seasonal nature of 

our work also accounts for the use of temporary workers.

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT 

&lt;103-1&gt;

Having sound human resource policies and practices are 

critical to our organisation as it allows Delfi to attract and retain 

the right talent to foster growth, development, creativity and 

value creation for the Group. We understand that having the 

right individual in the right position can have a profound impact 

on the performance of the Group and generate shareholder 

value. We acknowledge that our continued success is based on 

the commitment and joint effort of our employees. Similarly, 

we recognise that the provision of equitable opportunities 

for personal development and career advancement on top of 

tailored training to allow our employees to effectively discharge 

their duties in a safe manner are of equal importance in ensuring 

the well-being of our employees and further, helping them to 

fulfil their potential.

Employee 

Well-Being

MANAGEMENT APPROACH 

&lt;103-2&gt; &lt;103-3&gt; 

At Delfi, we believe that effective employee management policies 

should encompass all aspects from strong hiring practices, employee 

performance and employee conduct.

Our Hiring &amp; Human Resource (HR) Management policy is in place to 

ensure that we hire the appropriate number of individuals with the right 

expertise to ensure the smooth operation of the organisation. In addition, 

we strongly adhere to the principle of non-discriminatory hiring. For 

employees, we conduct periodic performance reviews to ensure that 

every individual has a fair and equitable chance to progress within the 

organisation and is given room for personal development.

Delfi has a strong Business Ethics &amp; Integrity policy that guides employees 

on their conduct to ensure that there is no conflict of interest between 

the employee and the company. Additionally, Delfi has an anti-sexual 

harassment policy and a code of conduct that promotes racial and 

religious harmony, as well as anti-bullying, to ensure that such behaviours 

are not tolerated at the workplace. 

We comply with all relevant labour laws and regulations.

Policy

We are committed to building a working environment that is conducive, 

inclusive and diverse.

In addition, we have following targets:

PRACTICES AND PERFORMANCE 

&lt;103-3&gt;&lt;401-1&gt;&lt;401-2&gt;

NEW HIRES AND TURNOVER2 

&lt;401-1&gt;

There was sufficient manpower to meet our core operational needs during the year. However, to 

meet anticipated surges in demand during yearly festive periods such as Ramadan and Christmas, 

temporary workers are recruited which often include rehiring those familiar with Delfi’s operations 

and those with a preference for such short-term contracts, thereby accounting for the overall 

turnover rate and correspondingly, new hire rate of 43.2%. Our permanent staff turnover rate was 

at about 12% for 2019.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 

&lt;401-2&gt;

Delfi cares about its people. Beyond rewarding employees with remuneration that is commensurate 

with the efforts and performance delivered in helping the business achieve its goals, Delfi is 

invested in the well-being and morale of our employees. In our belief that happy employees will 

in turn raise productivity and efficiency, Delfi offers an extensive suite of employment benefits 

tailored for our full-time employees. Apart from the provision of baseline benefits mandated

At Delfi, a safety culture is deeply rooted in our organisation 

and everything we do. In that direction, our ultimate aim 

is for zero accidents. As such we place great emphasis on 

Occupational Health and Safety (OHS). We are fully aware that 

in our workplace we are responsible for the health and safety of 

our employees. We therefore carefully and constantly consider 

employee safety to prioritise what more can be done to avoid 

accidents. This includes proper training and identification 

of workplace hazards to ensure our employees acquire the 

necessary knowledge for the safe and hygienic performance 

of their duties. Another key issue is to provide our employees 

with appropriate protective measures, and enforce their use, 

so as to minimise risk of accidents and reduce their possible 

consequences.

Occupational  

Health and Safety

MANAGEMENT APPROACH 

&lt;103-2&gt;&lt;103-3&gt; &lt;403-1&gt;

Our workforce is the heart of our operations, and their health and safety 

is of utmost importance. We meet and strive to exceed the relevant 

occupational health and safety standards. 

In Indonesia’s factory site, our employees are covered by an OHSAS 

18001:2007 certified OHS Management System which is internally 

and externally audited on an annual basis. However, with the release 

of International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) 45001 in March 

2018, OHSAS 18001 will soon be withdrawn. As such, we are in the midst 

of migrating our certification to ISO 45001 within the stipulated grace 

period for companies to do so.

Policy

We are committed to offer a healthy working environment and strive 

towards a healthy workforce. We aim for zero incidents resulting in 

fatalities and to continuously improve our health and safety performance 

across all our operations. We seek to be fully compliant with all relevant 

laws and regulations. 

In addition, we have the following targets:

Case Study: 

Behaviour Based Safety Card - Keeping up 

with the best workplace safety practices

 

We 

implemented 

a 

safety 

awareness 

programme that is based on a point system 

using a ‘Behaviour Based Safety Card’ (“BBS 

Card”) which encourages staff to give safety 

and work safety best practices, ‘top of mind 

status’. 

Through the BBS Card, data and information 

is collected and applied towards preventive 

action, mitigation of hazards, and unsafe 

action avoidance, to enhance our safety 

record. More importantly, everyone in the 

organisation has the chance and avenue to 

show that they care for each other. 

Appreciation sessions take place once 

every 6 months, to recognise and celebrate 

individuals who have been exemplary in 

their safety conduct and record.

PRACTICES AND PERFORMANCE 

&lt;103-3&gt;&lt;403-2&gt;

As an employer, Delfi recognises that with optimisation 

of the work environment, we inevitably promote the 

mental and physical well-being of all people. In our 

ongoing pursuit to achieve an accident-free workplace, 

we commit ourselves to internal and external audits 

that enables us to identify violations and areas for 

improvement. We constantly encourage our people to 

flag any unsafe working conditions and practices across 

our operations. Comprehensive training and education 

programmes are conducted at facilities to increase 

awareness and set expectations of our safety culture. 

Further to that, all employees are required to maintain a 

strict adherence to procedures when operating specific 

machines and equipment to safeguard them and their 

co-workers from any unexpected issues that may arise.

Delfi upholds the principle of being ‘accident free’ and 

in this direction, we have upheld our zero incidents 

resulting in fatalities for FY2019. There were 6 recordable 

work-related injuries. At Delfi, we regard all cases as 

important. Documentation of the incident is detailed in 

a corrective action report post-investigation and subject 

to further review and approval by a Safety and Health 

Coordinator. Subsequent follow-up is conducted to 

ensure the implementation of corrective and preventive 

measures, such as activity-based audits, enhancement 

of Lock-out/Tag-out (LOTO) procedures and risk 

assessment training.

We continue to assess the safety aspects of our facilities 

and stay proactive in the implementation of projects and 

initiatives to drive workplace safety results.

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT 

&lt;103-1&gt; 

The food and beverage industry landscape continues to advance 

and evolve. Fuelled by increasing stakeholder expectations, 

government regulations and innovation, the realities call 

for Delfi to sharpen its focus and awareness on consumer 

health and safety as a key sustainability matter since it directly 

impacts human lives. Consumers today are calling for greater 

transparency in disclosure of raw material origins, employee 

welfare, food safety programs and processes. A sizeable group 

of consumers are now looking beyond the traditional concerns 

of food safety – the effects of food-borne contamination or 

immediate physical affliction. These individuals are increasingly 

mapping their buying decisions to potential long-term health 

and wellness impacts as well as the environmental impact of 

sourcing and manufacturing food products. 

As an established chocolate and confectionery company, Delfi 

strongly believes in having the social responsibility to promote 

mindful consumption of our products – especially in our young 

consumers. We continually allocate resources in food science 

research and product innovation to design a wider range of 

healthier treats for the world to enjoy.

In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced its 

intention to eliminate the use of artificial trans fats, otherwise 

known as partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs), from the global 

food supply chain. They estimated that more than 500,000 

deaths a year could be attributed to cardiovascular diseases in 

which trans fat intake plays a significant role9. In light of the 

adverse impact caused by artificial trans fats, in 2019, Delfi 

voluntarily prioritised and committed to the removal of artificial 

trans fats across the full range of our manufactured products by 

the end of 2019. We are pleased to confirm that we achieved 

this important goal.

Consumer Health and Safety,

and Mindful Consumption

MANAGEMENT APPROACH 

&lt;103-2&gt; &lt;103-3&gt; 

Consumer health and safety, and mindful consumption are a priority for 

Delfi. We are proud of our Quality Management System that we have 

designed, developed, and implemented to ensure compliance with 

international and local food safety standards and recommendations. 

Our policy on the quality of our products emphasises the following:  

• 

Consistency in quality

• 

Microbiologically safe

• 

No foreign materials and no contamination

• 

Hygienically packed and sealed

Our Quality Management System is certified in accordance with 

internationally recognised standards (e.g. the FSSC 22000 Food Safety 

System Certification is internally and externally audited on an annual basis.)

Policy

We are committed to deliver our brand promise of quality and safety to 

our consumers. We seek to be fully compliant with all relevant consumer 

health and safety laws and regulations. 

In addition, we have the following targets:

Delfi’s Quality Management System

As part of our overall Quality Management System, we have 

made significant investments in quality assurance systems in 

order to consistently achieve high manufacturing standards. 

The manufacturing standards which the Group follows 

include:

Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”)

GMP was established by the Food and Drug Administration in 

the USA in 1967 under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug 

and Cosmetic Act. The GMP is based on international hygiene 

standards and promotes a quality approach to manufacturing. 

GMP guidelines provide minimum requirements that a food 

product manufacturer must meet to ensure  that the products 

are of high quality and do not pose any risk to the consumer 

or the public. The regulations are relatively general and allow 

the Group to decide individually how to best implement the 

necessary controls to achieve goals such as cleanliness, 

equipment verification and process validation. In doing this, the 

Group takes into account the specific needs of its consumers.

Consumer Health and Safety,

and Mindful Consumption

Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (“HACCP”)

HACCP was adopted by the Group as a comprehensive step-by-step food safety program for 

its production process. Assessments are made of the hazards applicable to microbiological, 

chemical, physical, food safety and quality standard risks. Based on such hazard assessments, the 

critical control points are determined within the production process to control identified hazards. 

Procedures for monitoring and taking corrective actions are established for each control point. 

Therefore, any problem is traceable to a specific point in the production process and/or the 

specific raw material utilised.

The Group conducts process testing to ensure the quality and specifications of our products are 

consistent and meet the exacting standards of our consumers. Such in-process testing involves 

performing tests on samples of products to determine if there are any quality defects. In addition, 

the Group conducts microbiological tests on samples to ensure that its strict specifications 

regarding microbiological content are adhered to so that its products are always safe for human 

consumption.

Each delivery of products is given a unique lot identification code printed on the individual packing 

and accompanying documents which incorporates the date of manufacture. It can be used to 

trace the complete production history of the product starting from the source of raw materials. 

Any delivery breaching the Group’s quality standards can thus be identified and stopped before it 

is delivered to its customers and consumers.

FSSC 22000 Food Safety System Certification

FSSC 22000 provides a framework for effectively managing the Group’s food safety responsibilities. 

FSSC 22000 is fully recognised by the Global Food Safety Initiatives (GFSI) and is based on existing 

ISO Standards. It demonstrates that the Group has a robust Food Safety Management System 

in place. The FSSC 22000 system uses a management systems approach to food safety, using 

ISO 22000 for the management system requirement and ISO Technical Standards or Publicly 

Available Specifications (PAS) for prerequisite program requirements. Our manufacturing facilities 

in Indonesia and the Philippines are currently certified against FSSC 22000 version 4.1, and will be 

upgrading to version 5 in due course.

High hygiene standards

Delfi observes high hygiene standards. Regular training and 

checks are conducted on our personnel at our facilities. 

These includes stringent requirements on attire, footwear and 

personal hygiene.

Innovation and technology

We draw on innovation and technology to improve our food 

safety standards. For example, we have made significant strides 

in improving our packaging materials to strengthen protection 

against the external environment. We have also rolled-out X-ray 

machines to enhance our foreign material detection systems 

across our facilities.

Labelling and communication

The display and provision of information on our products is 

important to our consumers as well as being the subject of 

many regulations. To that end, we strive to provide transparent 

access to reliable and accurate information on  our products 

through responsible labelling. Our labels advise on the expiry, 

recommended 

storage 

conditions, 

allergen 

declaration, 

ingredients, nutritional value, etc. We continuously seek to 

improve the contents of our product labels with greater 

emphasis on the sustainability impact of our products.

Customer care portal

We value feedback from our customers. We ensure that all 

customers and consumers are heard through the launch of 

our customer care and feedback portal. We are making positive 

progress in the implementation of updated labels across our 

products manufactured in Indonesia and the Philippines which 

bears the address of the portal. The portal aims to provide a 

direct avenue for all customers to reach out to Delfi and is also 

a central system for the business to maintain an overview of the 

quality of the products, service delivery and feedback received.

In 2019, we have met our target of no incidents of material 

non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations for 

consumer health and safety as well as for product information 

and labelling.

Product Storage

Our prescribed standards and best practices for storage in our 

value chain, ensures that our products are safe and fit for human 

consumption, as well as fresh enough for our customers to 

enjoy our products.

As a responsible guardian and steward of the environment, Delfi 

practices responsible water usage. Water is precious in every 

sense of the word, for human life, the well-being of individuals 

and the health of the community as a whole. With this in mind, 

we in Delfi exercise utmost care in managing our access to and 

usage of water. We are conscious of using only what the Group 

needs and engage in recycling at every available opportunity so 

as not to strain the water supply or unnecessarily tap into the 

water-table. Delfi is careful in looking after the availability of this 

precious resource, at every step of the value-chain, so that this 

‘balance’ in the ecosystem is preserved, soothed and allowed to 

perform its functions for the people in the community and the 

environment at large. We are of the view that management of 

our water access and usage play a significant role in our role as 

a good corporate citizen.

We seek to ensure that our operations use water responsibly 

and efficiently. We rely on both the municipal water supply as 

well as locally sourced groundwater for our needs. When there 

is a surplus in our water storage, we would share this with some 

of the local community and our neighbours.

In 2019, total water used by our units amounted to 234,429 

m3. On a per metric ton basis, the total volume of water used 

for 2019 was 5.15 m3/MT, which was a reduction of 1% from 

2018. This achievement was largely due to conservation efforts 

and control procedures established to limit unnecessary 

water use during production at our facilities. More notably, 

our commitment to increase the use of treated water that has 

undergone processing by our wastewater treatment plant at 

our facilities continues to play a significant part in reducing our 

consumption from external sources. 

Responsible 

Water Use

Case Study: 

Improving WWTP using Anaerobic System

 

After completing the first press installation in 2018, we 

focused on improving the quality of the waste water treatment 

plant (‘WWTP’) for water processing and filtration, by using 

an anaerobic system which enhances the effectiveness of 

the WWTP. This initiative supports our ‘reduce, reuse and 

recycle’ priority and is in line with our overall objective of 

recycling waste water and reducing groundwater usage.

Treatment and Disposal 

of Waste and Effluents

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT 

&lt;103-1&gt; 

Waste and effluents management is critical for global 

sustainable development. Proper sanitation, clean water and 

air is important for human health and the environment. As part 

of the food processing sector, we understand the importance 

in managing and reducing the waste and effluents generated 

throughout our operations. For our communities to prosper and 

enjoy a high quality of life, we have to conscientiously monitor 

our discharge into the environment and seek to eliminate or at 

least reduce any ecological impact. It is thus vital to prioritise 

waste disposal methods, that minimise any such impacts, such 

as reusing, recycling and recovery. Treatment of our effluents is 

also crucial in ensuring that hazardous substances do not leach 

into ecosystems and undergo bioamplification along the food 

chain. Managing waste also brings about potential cost-savings 

to our organisation. Looking into resource efficiency in our 

production will enable us to create more with less and deliver 

greater value to our stakeholders.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH  

&lt;103-2&gt;&lt;103-3&gt;

We believe in investing in good environmental housekeeping practices 

that will minimise our environmental footprint. Our waste and effluent 

management policies seek to fully comply with relevant laws and

Effluents 

&lt;306-1&gt;

We closely monitor our water discharge11 in both our 

manufacturing facilities in Indonesia and the Philippines. The 

wastewaters from our facilities are biologically treated before 

being discharged into nearby rivers. We utilise wastewater 

quality indicators to measure and ensure that these indicators 

are in generally acceptable ranges12 before discharge into the 

natural environment.

In 2019, a total volume of 65,522 m3 water was discharged in 

Indonesia and the Philippines. On a per metric ton basis, the 

total volume of water discharged for 2019 was 1.44 m3/MT, 

which was an increase of 5% from prior year. This increase 

was largely attributed to the collection of rainwater, in addition 

to the process water, which flows through to our wastewater 

treatment plant at Philippines’ facility for processing. 

11  In line with GRI Standards Disclosure 306-1, disclosure of water discharges in this Sustainability Report excludes discharge of collected rainwater and domestic sewage

12  Generally acceptable ranges of our water quality indicators include Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) below 100 mg/litre, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) below 50 mg/litre, Total Suspended Solids (TSS) below 

70 mg/litre, pH of 6.5 to 9.0

Waste 

&lt;306-2&gt;

At Delfi, we ensure that our waste is safely disposed of to 

ensure that we do not contaminate our environment. All of our 

waste is managed by authorised waste contractors, which is 

in line with regulatory requirements. The terms, hazardous and 

non-hazardous waste, are terms used in accordance with GRI 

Standards.

In 2019, the volume of overall waste amounted to 1,291,283 

kg in Indonesia and the Philippines. On a per metric ton basis, 

the volume of overall waste for 2019 was 28.39 kg/MT, which 

was a 10% reduction from prior year. This was achieved through 

close monitoring and a maintenance regime, to ensure optimal 

operating conditions.

Non-hazardous waste consisted of typical packaging and 

production peripherals comprising of paper, plastic, and 

metallic materials. In respect of our non-hazardous waste 

which made up 91.4% of our total waste, 92.9% was recycled, 

3.5% was accounted for through recovery, 3.4% was reused and 

the remaining 0.2% was disposed by contractors in compliance 

with local regulations.

Hazardous waste relates to waste from our analytical laboratory 

(e.g. laboratory chemicals) and maintenance activities (e.g. 

transformer oil). Our hazardous waste which amounted to 8.6% 

of our total waste, was managed and disposed of in compliance 

with local regulations by authorised waste contractors.

At Delfi, our sustainability objectives are integrated in our 

business practices. We understand that agricultural practices 

can potentially bring about adverse environmental impacts, 

and it is therefore an objective for our sourcing function that 

all the agricultural products used are derived sustainably and 

purchased responsibly along our direct supply chain. Delfi 

practices due diligence in our operations in ensuring minimal 

adverse environmental impacts, such as engaging stakeholders 

who believe in the same sustainability agenda as we do, and 

continuously improving our sourcing approach to advance our 

sustainability vision.

needed to prevent and mitigate any adverse impacts identified 

within our operations and in our direct supply chain.

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT 

&lt;103-1&gt; 

Delfi is a responsible organisation – Through our value 

creation chain, our resources, materials and products move 

across borders from country to country, on a daily basis. Any 

lapses or failures in compliance with import, export and trade 

regulations would directly impact our organisation and may 

lead to socioeconomic, civil or even criminal penalties. Non-

compliance could also cause significant business disruption 

such as loss of business opportunities, custom clearance and 

shipment delays, container abandonment or government 

sequestration. Such disruptions would ripple across our 

organisation – affecting our production and delivery schedules, 

greatly impacting our stakeholders across the value chain 

and our brand reputation. On a financial level, these costs 

collectively would have a significant bearing on our financial 

bottom line.

PRACTICES AND PERFORMANCE 

&lt;103-3&gt;

Our cross-functional teams support one another in ensuring 

that our approach towards being fully compliant remains robust. 

We conduct regular internal meetings to update each other on 

any changes to the relevant laws and regulations at the local, 

national and international level. These laws and regulations are 

complex, dynamic and require close monitoring. 

We work closely with Badan Pengawas Obat dan Makanan 

(‘BPOM’) Republik Indonesia and participate in BPOM’s focus 

group discussions for the formulation of regulations. This has 

strengthened our channels of communication with BPOM, 

providing us an official platform to directly engage and build 

on good sector practices shared in enhancing our compliance 

track record for food safety and quality.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH  

&lt;103-2&gt;&lt;103-3&gt;

To ensure smooth cross-border operations, we continuously update and 

refine our compliance systems and processes to ensure compliance with 

the relevant laws in all jurisdictions that we do business. 

Policy

We are committed towards full compliance with all applicable import, 

export and trade regulations in all the countries that we operate in.

In addition, we have the following target:

Scope

Values

OUR VALUES 

&lt;102-16&gt;  

Integrity, excellence and commitment, are values that guide 

all of us at Delfi as we seek to enhance our organisation’s 

development, performance and growth. These core values are 

embedded within our concept of corporate governance and 

form an integral part of Delfi’s ethos, business, systems, 

processes and operations. Our mission is to delight customers 

and consumers with superior chocolate confectionery 

products and services.

Delfi’s Code of Conduct provides a framework for ethical decision 

making and good conduct for the Group. The Code contains 

important core values and principles of the Company’s professional 

conduct and governance. The Board of Directors, Management 

and all employees are dedicated to upholding the Code. 

Governance

CODE OF CONDUCT 

&lt;102-17&gt;

Delfi has an Ethics Code, within our Code of Conduct, to which advice on matters of ethical 

concerns and grievances may be sought by our internal and external stakeholders. These 

matters will be handled objectively and subject to further investigation, disciplinary action/s or 

legal process, where justified and necessary. A link to the Code may be found at http://www.

delfilimited.com/NewsRoom/20190401-Code_of_Conduct-Delfi.pdf.

In addition, Delfi has a whistle blowing mechanism and policy that seeks to encourage reporting 

in good faith, of matters which may comprise misdemeanours, misconduct, fraud, corruption, 

illegal acts, etc. The mechanism and policy seek to provide for reporting in confidence that 

stakeholders are treated fairly and shielded from any reprisal.

In regard to issues relating to our ESG concerns, external stakeholders can also file their feedback, 

concerns or grievances through our general corporate relations channels. Internal stakeholders 

can do so through human resources / union-management channels. We seek to investigate, 

address and resolve all confirmed cases as soon as practicable. All grievance proceedings and 

records will be kept in confidence.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

&lt;102-18&gt; 

The Board of Delfi comprises a healthy well-balanced mix of entrepreneurs, professionals and 

corporate expertise. Out of a total of 8 Directors, our Board comprises 3 executive Directors, 

4 non-executive independent Directors and 1 non-executive non-independent Director. There 

is a clear separation of the role of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman. One of our 

3 executive Directors serves as CEO and Managing Director. The Board meets regularly and is 

provided with timely updates and information. As and when there are urgent commercial or 

other corporate matters, Board meetings are convened to seek guidance from the Board or to 

elicit a decision. All Directors are expected to act in good faith, and to act in the interests of Delfi. 

The Board is supported by the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee, the Remuneration 

Committee, the Nominating Committee, the Risk Management Committee and the Market 

Sustainability and Strategy Committee. These committees (with the exception of the Executive 

Committee) provide guidance and regularly review matters within their purview.

A full report on our corporate governance practices in compliance with the Code of Corporate 

Governance 2018 can be found under our Corporate Governance Report in our Annual  

Report 2019.

Delfi Limited Bursary

The Delfi Group believes that where possible we should 

support deserving students who are unable to achieve their 

academic potential just because they lack adequate funding. 

No person should be left behind for want of financial means 

to benefit from a good education. In the same vein, Delfi 

believes in the importance of nurturing and grooming the 

next generation as strong ethical leaders. Through the 

bursaries awarded to students of Singapore Management 

University (SMU), Delfi hopes to empower exceptional 

students to strive for excellence. There are 3 students on 

this programme for the academic year 2019/2020.





SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE (CONT’D)

Corporate Social Responsibility

Beyond our customers, consumers and business partners, Delfi recognises the importance of enriching lives and building sustainable relationships with the many 

communities we serve.

Governance

Delfi’s Milk Drinking Movement

Delfi partnered with an elementary school, Andir 01 Elementary School, in Bandung, Indonesia 

in September 2018 to bring the Milk Drinking Movement (Gerakan Minum Susu) to life. The 

Milk Drinking Movement is expected to benefit the students in giving them their nutritional 

needs for growth. Our work under this movement is expected to be carried out monthly over a 

3-year continuous period. To supplement our contribution to the children under this initiative, 

we try to liven the spirits of these children by providing them with additional chocolate treats 

to reward them for their efforts at school. 

The initiative is in keeping with Delfi’s regulatory commitment with Indonesia’s Ministry of 

Agriculture, to help energise and contribute to the development of the domestic fresh milk 

industry locally. To spread the joy that Delfi’s Milk Drinking Movement brings, we have expanded 

our reach to include other schools in Bandung, Indonesia, namely, SDN Dayeuhkolot 07 this year.

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT 

&lt;103-1&gt; 

Securing socially and environmentally sustainable agricultural 

products is important to Delfi and our stakeholders. We 

recognise that our impact on people and the environment 

extends beyond our own business activities. These impacts 

can occur as a result of our business relationships throughout 

our supply chain. Therefore, due diligence is expected of Delfi 

in taking concrete steps to prevent and mitigate all forms of 

adverse social and environmental impacts that are directly 

linked to our operations and products. To that end, we seek 

to drive the sustainability agenda along our supply chain and 

collaborate with like-minded business partners to mutually 

advance our shared sustainability vision.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH  

&lt;103-2&gt;&lt;103-3&gt;

We are committed to sustainable procurement and in promoting positive 

socioeconomic and environmental impact through our supply chain. 

In addition, we have the following target:

Commitments

&amp; Targets

Our emphasis is to actively seek out and work with suppliers that support 

sustainable practices. Sustainability is a core criterion in our supplier 

evaluation, and we are continuously improving our procurement and 

sourcing approach to drive the sustainability agenda. 

Delfi’s Prescribed Standards, Requirements &amp; Practices comprise our 

minimum requirements relating to the Environment, Social &amp; Working 

Conditions, in purchasing products, materials and services. Our approach 

is based on international laws, regulations and the core conventions as 

defined in the fundamental principles of Human Rights at work, namely:

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UN, 1948)

• 

Convention on the Rights of the Child (UN, 1989)

PRACTICES AND PERFORMANCE 

&lt;103-3&gt;

Delfi Limited’s Prescribed Standards

We urge all our partners and suppliers to uphold the Delfi 

Limited’s Prescribed Standards, Requirements and Practices 

for the Environment, Social and Working Conditions (“Delfi’s 

Prescribed Standards”).

We recognise that our business has an impact on people and 

the environment locally, globally and especially in the countries 

in which we operate and do business in. We believe that we are 

empowered to choose to act responsibly, with integrity and to 

do good while fulfilling our intent of being a good business partner. Upholding this principle is a 

pre-condition to our future growth; a growth that will be achieved along with other like-minded 

responsible business partners and suppliers who share and identify with our vision, mission and 

approach to doing business.

As a result, Delfi requires business partners and suppliers to acknowledge and agree to our Delfi’s 

Prescribed Standards, for the Environment, Social &amp; Working Conditions for the management 

of businesses, the purchase, and/or acquisition of products, materials and/or the delivery of 

services. Ultimately, it is the spirit of the Delfi’s Prescribed Standards that is important to us, and it 

is with this spirit that we consistently urge our business partners and suppliers to stand shoulder 

to shoulder with us in upholding the Delfi’s Prescribed Standards. 

The following table summarises the elements covered in the Delfi’s Prescribed Standards. 

Launch of Supplier Self-Assessment (“SSA”) Program

Aside from Delfi’s Prescribed Standards that our suppliers 

are encouraged to adhere to, we are currently in the midst 

of rolling out a SSA program which incorporates social and 

environmental criteria as part of our evaluation matrix used to 

assess new potential suppliers, as well as our existing suppliers 

in a phased-approach on their compliance and competence 

in managing ESG-related aspects across their value chain. 

The SSA questions are based on internationally-recognised 

standards such as but not limited to ISO14001 Environmental 

Management Systems, SEDEX membership and OSHAS, whilst 

taking into consideration the respective countries’ environmental conservation laws to assess 

suppliers on their attitude towards environmental and social responsibility.

Sustainability Projects and Initiatives

Delfi believes in collaborating with businesses, communities, governments and non-governmental 

organisations (‘NGOs’) to tackle systemic sustainability concerns that may be prevalent in 

our sector. So, for example, in the chocolate industry and the cocoa ingredients industry, it is 

imperative that we do our part in helping to address these concerns and work against known ills 

such as child labour, forced labour, human rights violations, cruelty against animals, deforestation, 

and pollution, while we also focus on promoting good policies and practices in employment, 

health, safety and governance.

At Delfi, passion for people has always been at the heart of what we do. Focusing our connections with all our stakeholders is vital for us to constantly meet and 

hopefully exceed their expectations. Our conversations with our stakeholders allow us to understand their key concerns and respond accordingly. Our sustainability 

approach draws upon these outcomes. We connect with our stakeholders through various modes of regular engagement including meetings, briefings, phone calls 

and other forms of communication.

Investors

Consumers

Employees

We aim to promote investors’ understanding of 

Delfi’s strategy and performance through timely, 

appropriate and accurate dissemination of 

corporate information. 

In the long-term, we seek to build trust-based 

relationships with our investors through our 

emphasis on governance structures and 

collaborative dialogue.

We are committed to going the extra mile to consistently 

provide superior quality for our consumers – many of 

whom have been with us across generations – with a 

superior Delfi experience. 

We emphasise continuous product development and 

quality enhancement in our journey to meet the needs of 

our broad range of consumers.

We provide a livelihood for our employees. Our 

aspiration is to create a workplace that all our 

employees and workers are proud of – a true 

Delfi family.  

Our focus is on treating our employees and 

workers fairly, fostering close labour union 

relations and advocating excellence in 

occupational health and safety.

Local Communities 

Suppliers

Customers

We respect the communities we operate in, 

and are keen to advance the interests of the 

Company and the community in lockstep. 

As a good corporate citizen, we aim to 

achieve our goals through actively shaping 

and participating in community programs and 

initiatives. 

As we view our suppliers as business partners, our 

objective is for mutual growth through fair and 

transparent dealings in compliance with relevant laws 

and regulations. 

We are also increasingly seeking out and working with 

suppliers that subscribe to our sustainability agenda. 

We audit our original product manufacturers and key 

suppliers for sustainable value creation.

At Delfi, we see distributors, wholesalers and 

retailers as our customers as well as our partners 

in expanding our reach to our consumers, and 

ultimately driving sales for the company. 

Our goal is to create a fair and mutually 

beneficial arrangement, through clear and open 

communication lines on expectations.

Governments &amp; Regulators

Trade &amp; Industry Associations

Non-profit Organisations

We have the utmost respect for the rule of law, 

and continually extend our cooperation with 

governments and regulators. 

It is our priority to ensure compliance with the 

relevant laws and regulations in the jurisdictions 

in which we do business.

Our goal is to play an active role in the trade and industry 

associations of which we are members, to help further 

the interests of the group. 

We hope to lend our support and contribute to the 

various initiatives that will help advance our  

sustainability agenda.

We seek to constructively engage non-profit 

organisations, align on common social causes 

and explore models for further partnership 

where feasible.
