BOARD STATEMENT 

 

At Dyna-Mac, sustainability means building businesses that deliver long-

term shareholder value and growth. In order to achieve this, we aim to adopt 

a disciplined and accountable approach founded on high standards of 

corporate governance and integrity. 

The Board of Directors (“Board”) incorporates long-term consideration of environmental, 

social and governance (“ESG”) issues when formulating Dyna-Mac’s sustainability 

strategies. In doing so, we strive to create value for our shareholders, as well as 

customers, employees, suppliers, contractors, partners and the communities in which we 

operate in. 

In the process of formulating our sustainability report, the Board recognises the 

importance of sustainability practices and how it can benefit our business operations and 

performance, and oversees the identification of ESG material topics that are pertinent to 

our business and aligns with our long-term business targets.  

Through the development of this report, the Board works closely with the Management 

for the monitoring and management of these ESG material topics.

About the Report 

Dyna-Mac demonstrates our commitment to sustainability through our inaugural 

sustainability report (“Sustainability Report”) for the period 1 January 2017 to 31 

December 2017 (“FY2017”). The report focuses on our sustainability strategies and 

covers our ESG performance across our operations in Singapore for FY2017 with prior 

year ended 31 December 2016 (“FY2016”) performance included for comparison, where 

possible. It aims to provide an overview of our approach, performance and targets for our 

key sustainability areas. 

The report is based on the principles and requirements in the Sustainability Reporting 

Guide of the Singapore Exchange Securities Limited (“SGX-ST”) and has been prepared 

in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative Standards: Core option.  

This Sustainability Report, containing the primary components as set out in Rule 711B, 

is issued with the approval of the Board. 

 

In line with the Company’s commitment to environmental sustainability, no hardcopies of 

this report have been printed. The report can be viewed on our website: http://www.dyna-

mac.com/sustainability/sustainability-reports/.

Our Approach 

 

Sustainability Leadership 

At Dyna-Mac, sustainability leadership starts with a tone at the top. We 

believe that every individual in Dyna-Mac plays an important role in ensuring 

that sustainability is embedded deeply within everything we do. To that end, 

we have taken steps to put in place a systematic monitoring and reporting 

process. 

We are committed to conduct our business in a responsible and sustainable manner. A 

Sustainability Steering Committee comprising senior management was set up to drive 

sustainability efforts within the Group. It is supported by a Sustainability Working 

Committee comprising the various heads of department who gather and verify the 

performance data, as well as introduce initiatives to drive the management of our material 

issues.

Materiality Assessment 

Prioritising sustainability topics is a critical process for us as it sets out the 

areas that we must focus on as an organisation. It also enables us to 

systematically report on matters that impact Dyna-Mac and its 

stakeholders most. To do that, our Sustainability Steering Committee 

embarked on a formalised Materiality Assessment process in 2017.  

In 2017, a materiality assessment workshop was held to identify significant 

sustainability matters that impact our business activities and its external stakeholders. 

Arising from the exercise, the Board and Management determined five key 

sustainability matters to be of highest priority to the Group’s sustainability risks and 

opportunities and the Board is satisfied with the relevance of the selected matters to 

its business strategy and performance.

list of potential sustainability 

matters identified through: 

 

• 

Analysis of trends and 

developments pertinent to 

Dyna-Mac and the industry 

it operates in 

 

• 

Analysis 

of 

commonly 

reported

Singapore 

 

• 

Internal 

stakeholder 

interviews and focus group 

discussions with members 

of 

our 

Sustainability 

Steering Committee 

 

Members of our Sustainability 

Steering Committee individually 

evaluated the list of potential 

sustainability 

matters 

and 

participated in a formalised 

Materiality 

Assessment 

workshop.  

An 

anonymous 

electronic 

voting exercise was conducted 

to prioritise the sustainability 

matters 

that 

are 

deemed 

significant to both Dyna-Mac 

and its external stakeholders. 

 

Our 

Sustainability 

Steering 

Committee 

reviewed 

Dyna-

Mac’s Materiality Matrix and 

selected 5 key sustainability 

matters ranked as significant to 

both Dyna-Mac and its external 

stakeholders, for reporting. 

The process and the results 

were presented to Dyna-Mac’s 

Board of Directors for their 

validation and approval.

Exercise to identify, filter, assess and compile our enterprise strategies and key risks, 

as well as to assess our general control environment. Through this exercise, the 

Management works closely with the Board to better align, manage and increase Dyna-

Mac’s resilience to emerging scenarios and environments.

FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES 

 

Our employees and workers are the heart of our business operations. We 

recruit and reward our people on a meritocratic basis and advocate an 

inclusive workplace built on mutual respect and trust. 

We believe that building a diverse and inclusive work environment is increasingly 

important to boost the morale and productivity of our employees. We value our 

employees and are committed to human resource policies that help us attract, retain 

and grow talent. Equality and meritocracy are values that impact employee satisfaction 

and retention, and ultimately achieving sustained value creation for our stakeholders.

Talent Retention, Development and Diversity 

 

We are committed to developing a competent, diverse and engaged workforce that 

will deliver product quality and service excellence. This is supported by our Code of 

Conduct, which sets the tone of the Company’s stance against discrimination on any 

basis, including ethnicity, nationality, gender, religious beliefs, or age.  

 

Dyna-Mac is also a signatory to the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices

Our employee retention strategy focuses on career development, employee welfare 

and employee engagement.  We have in place a grievance mechanism for employees

Due to the nature of our business and the manpower requirements of our projects in 

FY2017, our voluntary attrition rate was 19%, which is below the national industry

retaining employees.

ENERGY AND CARBON FOOTPRINT 

 

At Dyna-Mac, we recognise that our business operations have an impact 

on the environment. We are committed towards environmental protection 

and constantly work towards minimising our environmental impact to 

ensure sustainable business development. We strive towards operating 

in a sustainable manner so that we can continue delivering quality service 

and products to our clients. Within Dyna-Mac, we have a core focus in 

nurturing a culture of environmental consciousness among our 

employees, partners, clients and the communities we operate in. 

 

Managing our energy consumption and carbon emissions is a key focus area for Dyna-

Mac and we have implemented several good practices to reduce energy consumption. 

The health of our planet is important for the quality of life and survival of all 

stakeholders and future generations to come. The environment is also a critical 

external force that impacts our business decisions and operations. At Dyna-Mac, 

energy consumed is mainly fuel and electricity.

Dyna-Mac is fully committed to: 

 

1.

Ensure the prevention of any pollution including noise pollution. 

 

2.

Protect the environment and all persons working under the control of the organisation. 

 

3.

Environmental Risk Identification 

►

Energy use and carbon emissions is a key aspect in our environmental risk identification. We  

regularly assess our environmental impact based on significance, likelihood and consequence, and 

our controls and practices are designed to minimise our impact. 

 

Energy Reduction Initiatives 

Dyna-Mac is committed to reducing its energy consumption and carbon footprint. Our initiatives 

currently include the use of: 

►

Inverter type welding machine – 90% of our welding machines are inverter type DC welding 

machines and this translates to 50% savings in energy consumption per set compared to AC 

welding machines. 

 

►

Electric forklifts – all our forklifts used indoors are electric and this translates to 10 Litre/Hour of 

diesel usage reduction. 

 

►

Electric compressors – all compressors in Dyna-Mac premises in Gul Road are electric and this 

translates to 156 Litre/Hour of diesel usage reduction. 

 

►

LED lighting in premises – Dyna-Mac is currently in the process of changing lights on our premises 

to LED lightings, which will translate into approximately 75% reduction in energy consumption.

Fuel consumption 

Fuel consumption was mainly in the form of diesel oil used to operate Dyna-Mac’s 

vehicles and machinery. During FY2017, a total of 2.9 TJ of direct energy was 

consumed which directly translates to 220.0 tonnes of CO2 emitted.4 The decrease by 

86.9% from FY2016 levels was due to a decrease in business activities in FY2017 and 

as a result of Dyna-Mac’s energy reduction initiatives. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 Scope 1 GHG emissions are emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the organisation. In the scope of reporting, this relates to 

diesel oil consumed and it is expressed in tonnes of CO2.

Electricity consumption 

In FY2017, Dyna-Mac’s total electrical energy consumption decreased by 54.2% to 

3.74 MWh compared to 8.2 MWh in FY2016, corresponding to a decrease in CO2 

emitted to 1,569.9 tonnes of CO2.5 This is due to a decrease in business activities in 

FY2017. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 Scope 2 GHG emissions are emissions that result from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, heating, cooling, and steam consumed 

by the organisation. In the scope of reporting, this only relates to purchased electricity and is expressed in tonnes of CO2. In Singapore, the emission 

factor used is the grid emission factors for 2017 which is the latest estimate, obtained from “2017 Singapore Energy Statistics” published by the 

Energy Market Authority of Singapore in 2017.

WASTE AND EFFLUENTS MANAGEMENT 

 

We recognise that proper waste management is crucial for us to protect the 

environment and for the health and safety of the communities we operate in. Managing 

the proper disposal of waste is especially important for our industry. In shifting towards 

the adoption of the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle), we are also able to reap cost 

savings for our business. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Environmental Protection Procedure 

As set out in our OHSEM, we focus on three aspects: 

Minimising Waste 

Control of Dangerous and 

Harmful Materials 

Disposal Modes 

All 

staff 

– 

ranging 

from 

procurement, 

planning 

and 

stores, are encouraged to cut 

down on the amount of waste 

generated 

during 

our 

operations. 

This 

includes 

returning excess quantities of 

products for future use. 

All staff are trained to be 

familiar 

with 

hazardous 

materials 

and 

undertake 

precautions to safeguard the 

environment.  

Our Standard Work Procedures 

(SWPs) set out the procedures 

for disposing waste at Dyna-

Mac. These include disposal 

modes for: 

•

        Targets and Performance 

         Target 

2017 Performance 

Status 

 

By 2017, achieve a scrap margin of 

below 15%. 

 

Achieved 

 

Waste mainly relates to general waste and scrap metal. In FY2017, a total of 803.1 

tonnes of non-hazardous waste was disposed. Due to a decrease in business activities 

during the year and as a result of Dyna-Mac’s waste reduction initiatives, we have 

achieved a 65% decrease of total waste disposed from FY2016 levels.
