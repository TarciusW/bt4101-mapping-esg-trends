DEAR SHAREHOLDERS, 

The vision of Tat Seng Packaging Group Ltd and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) is to be the preferred corrugated 

products supplier.

Paper is made from wood, a truly renewable and sustainable resource. Responsible wood, pulp and paper production 

ensures healthy growing forests. Forest certification ensures wood comes from well-managed forests. The Forest 

Stewardship Council (FSC) certification is one of the world’s most recognisable certifications for well-managed forests. 

FSC certification allows consumers to identify, purchase and use wood, paper and other forest products produced 

from well-managed forests and/or recycled materials.

We manage the procurement of our paper roll raw materials to meet customer requirements of FSC certification and 

price competitiveness.

WORKPLACE SAFETY IS A MUST

Workplace safety is our top priority. Second is product quality. It is our responsibility to meet customers’ requirements 

and think about how to exceed their expectations.

Being able to collect 100% of our scrap paper is an important part of workplace safety. Infrastructure for managing 

paper waste is a feature that well-established manufacturing facilities of paper products should possess because of the 

fire hazards associated with the extensive use of paper materials. All our factories are equipped with fully-automated 

facilities for collecting and packing all scrap paper generated in the course of our production.

Collecting the scrap paper also allows us to measure paper wastage and identify the areas where productivity can be 

improved.

DEFINING REPORT CONTENT AND TOPIC BOUNDARIES

REPORTING APPROACH AND FRAMEWORK

We refer to the Global Reporting Initiative (2016) as a framework for disclosure inclusion. As the Group’s raw materials 

significantly comprise of paper, our management has identified that paper waste management and supplier assessment 

for environmental impact are key material aspects for the Group’s sustainable development.

Workplace safety and occupational health is also a priority as occupational hazards generally exist in a manufacturing 

environment. The Group’s policy is to have clear communication about workplace safety to eliminate hazardous 

incidents that may arise.

TOPIC BOUNDARIES

Disclosures in this report revolve around both our Singapore and China manufacturing facilities. Metrics applicable 

to GRI core disclosures are reported only if they are a good representation of the impact of our value chains. (Please 

refer to page 95 of our Annual Report 2018 for a list of our subsidiaries.)

The chart below represents internal stakeholders’ sentiment on the importance of sustainability issues material to the 

Group relative to internal stakeholders. 

STAKEHOLDER MATERIALITY ANALYSIS

Our Group-wide policies state clearly that all our business functions must comply with the legal obligations and laws 

in every jurisdiction in which we operate. The Group emphasizes on specific obligations in respect of anti-corruption, 

anti-trust, anti-money laundering, combating financial crimes, counter financing of terrorism, sanctions and fraud.

The chart above shows the priorities of the Group stakeholders based on a survey conducted in December 2018 with 

the heads of our various departments in our china subsidiaries. The priorities of internal stakeholders were assessed 

based on HOD opinion.

MATERIALS

Our raw materials for production mainly comprise of paper harvested from wood. Wood is a renewable resource. Paper 

can be recycled several times. These raw materials are sourced from external suppliers.

301-1 

WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO MANAGE WASTEPAPER

Our manufacturing process requires a large amount of paper rolls. In FY2018, our factories in China and Singapore 

consumed about 260,000 tons of paper rolls. During production, paper rolls are trimmed to produce boards and carton 

boxes. One of the main causes of paper waste is the trimming of paper. 

Paper waste management is very important to the Group and we strive to reduce and dispose of paper waste 

responsibly.

Company Specific Standards Disclosures

REDUCTION OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION

Burning coal has the worst health impact of any source of air pollution in China and caused numerous premature 

deaths over the years. Coal is responsible for 40 percent of the deadly fine particulate matter known as PM 2.5 in 

China’s atmosphere, which is detrimental to humans. Moreover, China’s coal consumption equals all the other countries 

combined, and coal burning is the biggest source of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The Organization 

for Economic Cooperation and Development warned that “urban air pollution” is set to become the top environmental 

cause of mortality worldwide by 2050.

Shifting weather patterns, changes in air quality and spread of vector-borne diseases pose significant risks for people’s 

health and well-being. Given its far-reaching implications and associated public health costs, combating climate change 

could also be the greatest opportunity to improve human health.

Hence, the Group continuously works to reduce its energy consumption and seeks to source for green sources of fuel.

Since 2017, the Group’s Singapore plant began using natural gas as an alternative source of fuel. Natural gas is 

preferred to fuel due to several reasons. 

Firstly, natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel and a highly efficient form of energy. Secondly, the chemical composition 

of natural gas lends itself to fewer impurities and generally results in less pollution. In addition, with the use of natural 

gas, promotes the use of other clean energy sources.

301 

HOW WE MANAGE WASTEPAPER

Improvements in our production processes reduce paper wastage and represent improved operational efficiency. 

Our operation team regularly reviews the practices at our production facilities and equipment in order to optimize our 

production results, maximize the effectiveness of our paper roll consumption, and ultimately improve our management 

of operation waste.

Our extensive capital investment in recycling infrastructure reduces the consumption of forestry resources. Our paper 

shreds are automatically collected using conveyor belts under grooves on our factory floor. The waste paper is then 

compacted into bales for disposal via a licensed wastepaper collection agent.

The external recycling company may then send the compacted bales of recovered paper shreds back to paper mills 

for production of pulp used in recycled paper.

TAT SENG PACKAGING GROUP LTD 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

Company Specific Standards Disclosures

ENVIRONMENTAL 

IMPACT


Even though natural gas is a fossil fuel, the global warming emissions from its combustion are much lower than those 

from coal or oil. Having opted to switch to natural gas, the Group will continue to work closely with the restrictions 

imposed in Singapore and China.

Our Suzhou, Hefei and Tianjin plants in China are currently using steam which produces significantly lesser harmful 

substances to the environment as compared to normal fossil fuel. For the Nantong plants, one of them has switched 

to natural gas while the other is currently using eco-friendly fuel.

303-2 

WATER &amp; EFFLUENTS

In Singapore, the discharge of effluents into its public sewers is regulated by its national water agency, Public Utilities 

Board (PUB). PUB regularly conducts spot checks on effluent discharge. In China, this is regulated by the respective 

municipal agencies.

The quality of effluent discharge was determined by PUB and a violation of this would result in a fine imposed by the 

government.

For both Singapore and China plants, the samples of waste water discharged form respective manufacturing facilities 

were sent to qualified lab test centre periodically in the country for analysis of concentration of toxic substances. 

During 2018, the relevant test results showed that the concentration of regulated substances from the samples were 

compliant within the allowable limits stipulated by the relevant authorities in Singapore and China.

306-1 

WATER DISCHARGE BY QUALITY AND DESTINATION

Access to clean water is essential for improving human health and well-being. Businesses also rely on high quality water 

as a key input in manufacturing operations. Growing populations, economic activity and consumption, combined with 

weak water governance in many regions around the world, are leading to increased competition for water and pose 

threats to water quality. Climate change is expected to exacerbate this problem, with increasing frequency of droughts 

and floods contributing to water scarcity. As demand for water continues to increase in tandem with population and 

economic growth, we will need to plan and implement water infrastructure well ahead to secure an adequate and 

affordable supply of water for the future generations.

The Group uses water for various production process of corrugated products, resulting in the release of wastewater 

effluents.

TAT SENG PACKAGING GROUP LTD 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

20

ENVIRONMENTAL 

IMPACT

Company Specific Standards Disclosures


Our water quality goal is to discharge of waste water in a more efficient manner. Because-year- to-year variability and 

acute system and weather-related events can significantly affect our water discharges, we will continue to closely 

monitor the test results to ensure we discharge waste water in an appropriate manner. To this end, we are committed 

to use water responsibly and to meeting our Company’s water demand without limiting the availability or quality of 

water resources to others.

PUB standards for wastewater management have become more stringent because of Singapore’s increasing reliance 

on NEWater as a one of our 4 national taps. The NEWater process recycles our treated used water into ultra-clean, 

high-grade reclaimed water, cushioning our water supply against dry weather and moving Singapore towards water 

sustainability. Today, there are five NEWater plants supplying up to 40% of Singapore’s current water needs. By 2060, 

NEWater is expected to meet up to 55% of Singapore’s future water demand.

To conform to the stringent PUB requirements, we decided to upgrade our wastewater treatment process. In January 

2018, we installed and commissioned advanced equipment to enhance the wastewater management capability at our 

Singapore plant. We have also formed a wastewater management team that conducts regular inspections to assess 

the risk exposure on the discharge of industrial wastewater. 

306-2 

WASTE BY TYPE AND DISPOSAL METHODS

Waste management is both a local issue for the communities in which we live and operate, and a global issue when 

it comes to ocean plastics pollution. Having operations globally, we have an important role to play in reducing our 

operational waste and contributing to the circular economy approach. Our responsible waste management strategy 

is key in this regard.

The Group is aiming towards zero discharge of waste water to public sewers. We will recycle some of the production 

waste water for our production requirement and evaporate the excess waste water through our evaporator. Any 

remaining residue in its solid state shall be disposed through the licensed waste collection contractor.

WHY SUSTAINABLE PAPER PROCUREMENT IS IMPORTANT

RESPONSIBILITY

Most of our raw material is paper roll, and that is produced from wood. Deforestation, the clearance of forests for 

conversion of land to a non-forest use, accounts for almost the same carbon emissions as the entire world’s transport 

sector and is a major driver of biodiversity loss.

Many of our customers now require our paper packaging solutions to be certified by the Forest Stewardship Council 

(FSC®).

308 

HOW WE MANAGE SUSTAINABLE PAPER PROCUREMENT

POLICY

We procure paper roll mainly from FSC® certified suppliers. The certification system allows us to identify, purchase and 

use wood, paper and other forest products produced from well-managed forests and/or recycled materials. Adoption 

of the FSC® Chain of Custody means that the paper we use as raw material is unlikely to have been harvested illegally 

in violation of traditional or civil rights, or in a way that threatens high conservation value areas.

The meeting is chaired by the committee chairman who is also our Production Manager. The committee secretary is 

a registered Workplace Safety &amp; Health officer.

POLICY

• 

Control risks at workplace.

• 

Maintain a safe work environment.

• 

Make sure that safety is maintained in the handling of all equipment used.

• 

Provide easily accessible resources for dealing with emergencies and for keeping the workplace safe.

COMMITMENT

Total Workplace Safety and Health (“Total WSH”) is an integrated approach to managing safety, health and well-being in 

the workplace. This approach views a safe and healthy workplace as one that has workers and managers collaborating 

in a continual improvement process to protect and promote the health, safety, and well-being of all workers and the 

sustainability of the workplace.

Each employee is expected to observe all rules and regulations governing safety practices, use the safety equipment 

provided and practice safety at all times.

PROTECTIVE RESOURCES

• 

We provide the proper work tools and personal protection equipment such as safety shoes, respirators, and eyes 

google to employees where necessary.

• 

We provide employees with ear plugs/ear muffs to mask noise pollution arising from our machines. To avoid 

noise-induced deafness, employees are required to wear ear plugs/ear muffs during working hours at all times.

• 

We engage a healthcare services provider to provide a hearing test service at our factory premises annually. The 

hearing test determines the hearing ability of all our employees who are exposed to excessive noise. All of our 

employees in Singapore that are exposed to long term noise hazards arising from operation of corrugator machines 

go through this test that we fully sponsor.

• 

China plant has been equipped with sound proof facilities at the corrugated line to reduce noise pollution.
