heritage of the Boustead Group under 

Boustead Singapore Limited, which has 

contributed almost two centuries of 

progress and maintains their longstanding 

position as Singapore’s oldest continuous 

organisation – a practical and symbolic 

reflection of longevity.

Sustainability reporting has taken centre 

stage among the world’s latest corporate 

reporting initiatives.  However, we prefer 

the term ‘Longevity Reporting’, being deeply 

rooted in the enduring heritage of the 

Boustead Group.  This past year, we also 

tackled the challenging environment posed 

by the COVID-19 pandemic, an existential 

threat to the longevity and wellbeing of the 

world.

Regardless of how COVID-19 or any 

other major crises may change the way 

we operate, one thing is indelible – our 

distinct brand of entrepreneurialism, 

institutionalised in a corporate culture that 

links back to the Boustead Group’s earliest 

days of trading.  We embrace the Boustead 

Way, which prioritises the pursuit of 

business with a greater purpose.  It is about 

creating sustainable shared socio-economic 

value instead of maximising short-term 

profit; promoting adaptability and resilience; 

and favouring longevity over sentimentality.  

It is also a position, a value, a commercial 

sensibility that runs through every layer of 

our organisation.

BOUSTEAD PROJECTS LIMITED FY2O21 LONGEVITY REPORT



LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS

Our total revenue was 29% lower year-

on-year at S$301.4 million.  Traditionally, 

our Engineering &amp; Construction (“E&amp;C”) 

business segment has been the key driver 

of revenue and also a substantial profit 

contributor.  However, during FY2021, 

the pandemic and ensuing spread of 

COVID-19 within the community and 

foreign labour dormitories, forced the 

Singapore Government to impose a four-

month shutdown of the built environment 

sector, which affected all of our Singapore 

project sites.  Following the reopening of 

the built environment sector, we enacted 

a gradual ramp-up in construction 

activities in line with government 

advisories and safe management 

measures, although this was far from our 

pre-pandemic peak.

Our record net profit of S$131.7 million 

was supported by BIF’s value-unlocking 

transaction one-off gain of S$134.8 

million (the “BIF Value Unlocking Gain”), 

recorded following our sale of interests 

in 14 leasehold properties to BIF – full 

disposal of 11 properties and partial 

disposal of equity interests in a subsidiary 

and two joint ventures – selected from 

our portfolio of 25 leasehold properties.  

The BIF Value Unlocking Gain more 

than offset the E&amp;C business segment’s 

elevated pandemic-related costs, lower 

margins on current projects and lower 

quantum of cost savings from previously 

completed projects.  Had net profit 

been adjusted to exclude the BIF Value 

Unlocking Gain, there would have been 

a net loss but this was contained at 

S$3.2 million, thanks to our entire team’s 

commitment, progressive transformative 

technologies put in place in past years 

and a number of cost management 

measures implemented during FY2021.

FY2021 – A Tale of Two Businesses

In FY2021, the fortunes of our two key 

business segments – E&amp;C and Real Estate 

– were a striking contrast which also 

revealed the effectiveness of our business 

model that unites the entire industrial real 

estate value chain.

E&amp;C business segment revenue was 32% 

lower year-on-year at S$264.7 million, due 

to the prolonged closure of Singapore 

project sites and conditions imposed by 

and in response to the pandemic.  E&amp;C 

business segment profit before income 

tax (“PBT”) was 84% lower year-on-year at 

S$3.1 million, hit by elevated pandemic-

related costs on multiple fronts, although 

Dear Fellow Stakeholders,

It is our pleasure to present to you the 

Boustead Projects Limited FY2021 

Longevity Report for the financial year 

ended 31 March 2021.

FY2021 has been a milestone year, 

in which we delivered a record profit 

attributable to shareholders (“net 

profit”) crossing the S$100 million mark 

for the first time and finishing 493% 

higher year-on-year at S$131.7 million.  

This significant accomplishment was 

underpinned by the successful launch of 

Boustead Industrial Fund (“BIF”), a value-

unlocking event that had been anticipated 

by shareholders and which we prioritised 

to deliver.  Nonetheless, hidden beneath 

this achievement was an environment 

fraught with the toughest challenges that 

we have had to face as an organisation, 

brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

this was buffered by this business 

segment’s S$19.9 million share of the BIF 

Value Unlocking Gain, due to the reversal 

of previously eliminated construction 

margin attributable to the E&amp;C business 

segment.  FY2021 has been by far the 

most challenging year in our history since 

1996.  While the Asian Financial Crisis, 

Dot-com Bust and Global Financial Crisis 

significantly affected the E&amp;C business 

segment during those crises, they were 

largely financial crises in nature that 

reduced foreign direct investments in 

Singapore and in turn the pipeline of 

enquiries for this business segment’s 

solutions.  In contrast, this pandemic has 

dented not only business development 

activities but has directly affected project 

execution, from prolonged project 

closures to significantly lower productivity 

and a severe shortage of foreign labour 

resources.  This combination of multiple 

simultaneous impacts has left behind 

sector-wide repercussions.

During this crisis, priorities were first and 

foremost placed on safeguarding the 

wellbeing of our stakeholders including 

our team, subcontractors and their 

employees, clients and surrounding 

communities by implementing strict 

health checks, social distancing 

measures, split teams and remote 

working arrangements.  Following the 

reopening of our offices and project sites, 

whether here in Singapore or overseas, 

the emphasis was placed on disinfecting, 

reconfiguring our mental frames of mind 

and physical spaces to ensure safe 

distancing and implementing strict safe

management measures.  We also initiated 

difficult but important conversations with 

our team, clients and subcontractors on 

topics such as project schedule revisions, 

cost sharing and how to progress 

forward in the face of unprecedented 

challenges.  Great efforts were expended 

to understand the positions of all key 

stakeholders to ensure that collectively 

we survive this pandemic.

We also proactively took several 

measures to mitigate the impact of 

delays and to protect the viability and 

long-term value of our businesses.  

Cost management measures included 

organisation-wide cost reviews, a salary 

freeze for our entire team and a reduction 

in Board fees and senior management 

salaries since June 2020.  Our Board and 

executive directors took 10% reductions 

in directors’ fees and base salaries 

respectively, while the rest of our senior 

management team was subjected to 

tiered 5% to 7.5% reductions in base 

salaries.

Following the reopening of Singapore 

project sites in mid-FY2021, the E&amp;C 

business segment commenced on 

making up lost ground on several projects 

in Singapore including our two largest 

projects for JTC Kranji Green and Surbana 

Jurong Campus.  By the end of FY2021, 

the E&amp;C business segment was also 

able to secure the temporary occupation 

permits for joint development projects 

– 351 on Braddell and Bombardier 

Singapore Service Centre Phase 2 – while 

another joint development, Razer SEA HQ 

received its temporary occupation permit 

just after the end of FY2021.

While Singapore projects faced 

pandemic-related delays, specified 

extensions of time were also received 

under the COVID-19 (Temporary 

Measures) Act 2020.  Overseas, the 

situation was much better for projects in 

China and Malaysia.  Sizeable projects in 

these two overseas markets – including 

our largest project captured in FY2021 to 

design and build an advanced integrated 

high-tech manufacturing and office facility 

in Penang, Malaysia for a Fortune 500 

technology corporation – progressed on 

schedule, facing only minor disruptions.

Technology continued to play a key 

role in mitigating risks associated 

with the pandemic, allowing for highly 

collaborative activities including 

integrated digital delivery (“IDD”), design, 

value engineering and construction to 

be conducted in a productive and safe 

manner.

During FY2021, our IDD Team continued 

to push forward with transformative 

technologies implementation and 

strengthened value propositions in 7D 

building information modelling (“BIM”) by 

utilising 3D scanning, artificial intelligence 

and machine learning, augmented reality 

(“AR”) and virtual reality (“VR”), data 

analytics and drone technology.  Our team 

and stakeholders were able to tap on a 

combination of AR and VR and Cloud-

based sharing platforms to review virtual 

7D BIM models simultaneously, without 

the need for stakeholders to be present in 

the same room.

Technologies were also implemented 

to enhance onsite safe management 

measures – among the world’s strictest 

– at project sites.  In a partnership with 

TraceSafe under the Open Innovation 

Platform, we outfitted our team and 

subcontractors’ employees at one 

project site with TraceSafe’s wearable 

safety devices.  Attached to helmets, 

these devices can withstand the rugged 

conditions of the built environment sector 

and are able to provide real-time contact 

tracing, safe distancing and geofencing 

capabilities onsite.  These devices send 

signals to individual workers when they 

breach safe boundaries of separated work 

zones or are too close to one another, 

making everybody onsite safer.  With the 

successful implementation at the first 

project site, TraceSafe is now being rolled 

out across all project sites.

In contrast to the impact on the E&amp;C 

business segment, Real Estate business 

segment revenue was 7% higher year-

on-year at S$36.7 million, mainly due 

to a full-year of rental contribution from 

the fully-leased Boustead Industrial 

Park Phase 1 in Vietnam, a short-term 

sublease for 36 Tuas Road and increased 

management fees from Boustead 

Development Partnership.  Real Estate 

business segment PBT was exponentially 

higher after adding in this business 

segment’s super majority share of the 

BIF Value Unlocking Gain, leading to our 

record net profit.

Other than being instrumental in the 

successful launch of BIF, the Real Estate 

business segment was also responsible 

for securing a number of sizeable leases 

for leasehold properties, both completed 

and under development.  New leases 

totalled over 53,700 square metres of net 

lettable area – with the likes of Zuellig 

Pharma, NETS, Shopee, JustCo and a 

Fortune 500 corporation – over the course 

of FY2021.   351 on Braddell and Razer 

SEA HQ also achieved at least two-thirds 

committed occupancy prior to receiving 

temporary occupation permits.

Transforming Our Business Model with 

Boustead Industrial Fund

The Board had made the establishment 

of BIF a priority pre-pandemic but it 

was thanks to the commitment of our 

team that BIF was able to launch during 

the pandemic, even as stakeholder 

engagements had become more complex 

and global travel restrictions had taken 

effect.  Had our team not gone through 

extraordinary efforts, any launch would 

likely have been delayed by another year.

BIF represents our maiden full-fledged 

private real estate trust.  Strategically, BIF 

has transformed our business model and 

integrated platform that unites all parts 

of the industrial real estate value chain – 

from value-added capabilities spanning 

E&amp;C and real estate development and 

asset management services to fund 

management services.  This significantly 

enhances our offerings to clients and 

adds greater flexibility to our structuring 

of potential development opportunities.

OTHER INFORMATION

Even as the bulk of our wholly-owned 

leasehold properties has now been 

sold into BIF, we still retain a pipeline of 

leasehold properties – mainly under joint 

ventures – with over S$700 million in 

expected market valuation.  Once eligible 

assets in Singapore are stabilised, they 

will have the potential to be injected 

into BIF.  With our existing portfolio and 

future pipeline of secured development 

projects, we expect that there will be a 

steady stream of sponsor assets that can 

be progressively injected into BIF over 

several years.  As the 100% manager 

and 25% unitholder of BIF, Boustead 

Projects will continue to reap the benefits 

of properties sold to BIF, especially when 

it expands.  Holding the manager role, 

we will be entitled to base management 

fees, development fees, acquisition 

fees, divestment fees and property 

management fees, similar to what 

listed REIT managers would receive for 

managing their respective listed REITs.

BIF has also established our new fund 

management business, in which we are 

now able to bring in and manage third-

party investors’ funds for investments in 

stabilised recurring-income assets.  This 

flexibility opens our business model to a 

new set of partners, especially those more 

interested in investments in de-risked 

assets rather than partnerships for joint 

development projects which carry higher 

risk profiles.

BIF represents a model on which we can 

base potential future real estate trusts on, 

if we are able to build up other sizeable 

leasehold portfolios, particularly in 

overseas markets.

FY2022 – Another Difficult Year on the 

Path to Recovery

Given that the margins for projects 

secured pre-pandemic do not take into 

consideration subsequent elevated costs, 

the E&amp;C business segment’s performance 

will continue to be affected in FY2022, 

as we complete the last of such projects.  

Despite the pandemic, we secured about 

S$178 million in contracts during FY2021 

that are contractually more risk-mitigated 

and protected against pandemic-related 

disruptions, which will help us even if the 

pandemic persists.  Nonetheless, lower 

productivity and foreign labour shortages 

are expected to remain in the foreseeable 

future.

Although things may remain slow in some 

areas, this will not deter us from building 

upon our credible reputation for being 

progressive, as demonstrated by our 

continuing enhancement of our business 

model, transformative technological 

implementations and most recent 

addition of BIF.  Our cash levels and 

balance sheet have never been stronger.

Many questions have been posed on 

our next steps after the formation of BIF, 

especially our capital expenditure plans 

and how we plan to reinvest.  As seen 

with our recent announcement of the 

signing of the option agreement for the 

intended formation of KTG &amp; Boustead 

Industrial Logistics Fund (“KBILF”), we 

have already taken our next steps.  Once 

consummated, KBILF Phase 1 will allow 

our joint venture fund to acquire seed 

assets amounting to about US$141 

million in gross asset value covering 

about 840,000 square metres of land 

area and about 550,000 square metres of 

gross leasable area.  KBILF Phase 2 will 

lead to the acquisition of other potential 

industrial real estate assets under an 

identified pipeline of targets, which 

would have the potential to double the 

land area and gross leasable area in the 

portfolio.  As one of the only economies 

to witness GDP growth during the 

pandemic, Vietnam’s potential remains 

intact.  Demographically, Vietnam enjoys 

a sizeable young population and a skilled 

workforce catered to the industrial sector.  

Geopolitically, Vietnam is well located 

geographically and has been a beneficiary 

of the world’s political situation.

Apart from KBILF, we are also pursuing 

a number of development opportunities, 

both here in Singapore and overseas, and 

possess the financial strength to diversify 

our revenue and profit streams in multiple 

industry sectors, real estate sectors and 

geographic markets.

Our progressive reputation for 

transformation continues to contribute in-

built resilience that will help us to prevail 

in this difficult environment.  In addition, 

investments in refining our smart, eco-

sustainable and future-ready business 

park and industrial real estate solutions, 

and ConTech and PropTech will continue, 

helping to ensure longevity for ourselves 

and our stakeholders.

In this report, we hope that you gain 

an in-depth understanding of how we 

remain progressive and resilient, ensure 

our longevity and protect the viability 

and long-term value of our businesses 

and the wider ecosystem that we are 

interconnected with.  We also share how 

we strive towards what the Boustead 

Group has achieved in longevity over 

almost two centuries and how this 

translates to delivering sustainable shared 

socio-economic value and progress to key 

stakeholders, along with the communities 

that we reside in and our collective home 

– Planet Earth.  Our performance, policies 

and practices on material economic, 

environmental, social and governance 

topics are explained.

Thank you for entrusting us with the role 

of being a trustworthy corporate citizen, 

one which we hope to honour for many 

more decades to come, as we continue 

to be highly reflective about how our 

actions ‘ripple upon the pond of life’.  This 

journey is an ultramarathon, which we will 

continue running in the Boustead Way 

and hope to have you join, even if only for 

part of the way.  Have an enjoyable and 

insightful read.

May you and your loved ones stay well,

BOUSTEAD PROJECTS LIMITED FY2O21 LONGEVITY REPORT

SECTION 1 – LONGEVITY REPORTING FRAMEWORK

1.1 ABOUT THIS REPORT

1.1.1 Report Period &amp; Scope

This is the Boustead Projects 

Limited FY2021 Longevity Report, 

an annual publication dedicated to 

providing a more holistic review of our 

performance, especially covering non-

financial areas such as environmental, 

social and governance (“ESG”) topics 

that are material to our business and 

key stakeholders.  This report covers 

our ESG performance under both core 

business segments – Engineering 

&amp; Construction (“E&amp;C”) and Real 

Estate – including our headquarters, 

administrative offices, significant E&amp;C 

project sites under our control and 

management, and managed real estate 

in all geographic markets where we 

have a significant presence: Singapore, 

China, Malaysia and Vietnam, unless 

otherwise indicated.

This report contains at least four 

full-years of data on material ESG 

topics and is aligned with our financial 

reporting period from 1 April 2020 to 31 

March 2021 (“FY2021”).  Our previous 

report was aligned with our financial 

reporting period from 1 April 2019 to 31 

March 2020 (“FY2020”) and issued on 

28 October 2020.  Our inaugural report 

was issued on 22 November 2018.  We 

voluntarily disclosed four full-years of 

historical data for comparison as we 

believe in upholding high standards of 

accurate, consistent, sincere, timely and 

transparent disclosure, that provides 

clarity on our ESG performance and 

trends over time.

This report should be read in 

conjunction with the Boustead Projects 

Limited FY2021 Annual Report for 

context.  It should also be noted that 

the governance topic has not been fully 

discussed in this report.  Our latest 

Corporate Governance Report (“CG 

Report”) is available in its full text within 

the Boustead Projects Limited FY2021 

Annual Report from pages 58 to 88.

The terms ‘Longevity’ and 

‘Sustainability’ are interchangeable.

1.1.2 Report Content

Content in this report was defined by 

identifying and prioritising our material 

ESG topics through an ESG materiality 

assessment process.  Efforts were 

made to ensure that material ESG 

topics are reflective of the current 

ESG topics that are material to our 

business and key stakeholders.  Data 

collection on material ESG topics is 

also supported by our subsidiaries’ 

operations teams that oversee the 

certification and implementation of ISO 

9001 Quality Management System, ISO 

14001 Environmental Management 

System, ISO/IEC 27001 Information 

Security Management System, ISO 

45001 Occupational Health &amp; Safety 

Management System (upgraded from 

SS506 Part 1 and OHSAS 18001), and 

other key programmes such as the 

Building &amp; Construction Authority 

Construction Quality Assessment 

System, Green &amp; Gracious Builder 

Scheme and Green Mark Certification 

Scheme, and the Workplace Safety &amp; 

Health Council bizSAFE Programme.

This report has been prepared in 

accordance with Global Reporting 

Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core, with 

at least three years of comparative data 

as required by GRI Standards: Core.  

The respective GRI Standards that have 

been applied are available in the GRI 

Content Index listed on pages 91 to 

97.  References have also been made 

to the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable 

Development Goals.

GRI Standards has been selected and 

used within our Longevity Reporting 

Framework – applied since we issued 

our inaugural report – because it 

represents not only the first global 

sustainability reporting framework 

but is independent and continues to 

be the only sustainability reporting 

framework that can demonstrate 

widespread global adoption.  According 

to the KPMG Survey of Sustainability 

Reporting 2020, 73% of the world’s 250

to seize opportunities to deliver 

sustainable shared socio-economic 

value and progress to key stakeholders, 

while being well-supported by sound 

risk management.  Our risk appetite 

considers material ESG topics that 

may affect reputational risk, ethical 

and moral considerations, and have 

significant financial and non-financial 

implications. 

Other than financial performance 

targets, our Board and the 

Remuneration Committee have set 

key ESG performance targets for 

our Executive Directors to meet 

annually, which are directly tied to their 

remuneration packages.  Our Executive 

Directors have further set key ESG 

performance targets for functional 

directors and/or managers to meet 

annually, in relation to their respective 

functional roles and which are directly 

tied to their respective remuneration 

packages.  Examples of such ESG 

performance targets include targets for 

improving eco-sustainability, quality, 

EHS, team development and technology 

performance, policies and practices.

1.2 BOARD LONGEVITY STATEMENT

Our Board is committed to ensuring 

our longevity including reviewing our 

performance, policies and practices

social and governance (“ESG”) topics.

Our Board is assisted in this by the 

appointed Group Longevity Reporting 

Champion &amp; Lead (“Group Champion”), 

who is advised by our Executive 

Directors and extended leadership 

team in Group Headquarters.  The 

Group Champion coordinates the 

implementation of the Longevity

functions.  Our Board is further 

assisted by our existing robust systems 

including audit, compliance, enterprise 

risk, financial, environmental, health 

and safety (“EHS”), human resource, IT 

and operational management systems, 

which feed into our Longevity Reporting 

Framework.

Our Board assesses opportunities and 

risks presented by material ESG topics.  

This helps our Board to determine the 

appropriate strategies that will provide 

us with the adaptability and flexibility

BOUSTEAD PROJECTS LIMITED FY2O21 LONGEVITY REPORT

1.4 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL 

&amp; GOVERNANCE MATERIALITY 

ASSESSMENT

Boustead Projects conducted an ESG 

materiality assessment process in order 

to determine material ESG topics that 

should be included in this report.  ESG 

topics are considered to be material if 

they may have a significant impact on 

our business and ability to achieve our 

long-term objectives to be adaptable 

and resilient, deliver sustainable shared 

socio-economic value and progress to 

key stakeholders, and make a positive 

impact economically, environmentally 

and socially on the world.  The views of 

both external and internal stakeholders 

are taken into account when 

determining the material ESG topics 

that should be included in this report.

To ensure that material ESG topics 

remain up-to-date, we periodically 

review current and emerging 

megatrends, changes in the economic, 

political, regulatory and ESG landscape 

in the geographic markets and sectors 

that we operate in, along with the views 

of key stakeholders.  These are then 

updated in our assessment process.

1.4.1 Key Stakeholder Engagement

We define key stakeholders as being 

groups that our business may have 

a significant impact on or vice versa, 

and who have a vested interest in 

the way that we conduct business.  

After a thorough review, nine key 

stakeholders were identified, along with 

their significance, conversations and 

channels of communication, as shown 

on pages 13 to 17.

In FY2021, most conversations with 

key stakeholders were in relation to the 

COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on 

our business segments – E&amp;C and Real 

Estate – as well as how our response 

to the pandemic would impact key 

stakeholders.  This was consistent 

across almost all key stakeholder 

groups.

These activities include design, value 

engineering, project management, 

construction management, development 

management, asset management and 

fund management and the application 

of proprietary domain expertise that 

extends over a regional network of key 

stakeholder relationships.  Creating the 

ideal environment for our team to thrive 

in will eventually translate to the delivery 

of sustainable shared socio-economic 

value and progress to key stakeholders.

Materiality Assessment Process

In 2017, we conducted a materiality 

assessment workshop with our key 

team members including our senior 

management team and functional 

heads in Singapore, who acted as 

proxies for the nine key stakeholders 

that have been identified, and 

highlighted and prioritised material 

ESG topics of relevance to these key 

stakeholders.  Following the completion 

of the materiality assessment 

workshop, we were able to consolidate 

and validate 12 material ESG topics 

for inclusion initially.  Community 

development was not material but has 

been added due to its significance to 

the business environment.  In addition, 

due to the onset of the COVID-19 

pandemic and its material impact on 

our business and key stakeholders, 

COVID-19 and infectious disease 

outbreaks had been added as a material 

ESG topic during FY2020 and continues 

to be included in this report.

In FY2021, conversations with and 

feedback from key stakeholders 

continued to affirm the validity of 

material ESG topics.

1.4.3 Opportunities &amp; Risks

We are vigilant in ensuring that our 

strategies to enhance stakeholders’ 

shared socio-economic value are well-

supported by sound risk management.  

Our material ESG topics present us 

with both opportunities (if we embrace 

the right approaches to managing 

these ESG topics) and risks (if we 

neglect these ESG topics), which 

are supplemented by our existing 

robust systems and Enterprise Risk 

Management Framework.

In addition, on 1 January 2016, the 

United Nations (“UN”) officially rolled 

out 17 Sustainable Development 

Goals (“SDGs”) of the 2030 Agenda 

for Sustainable Development.  The 

SDGs universally apply to all countries 

with the ultimate aim of mobilising 

all stakeholders – governments, civil 

societies, the private sector and 

others – to collectively contribute to 

ending poverty, fighting inequality 

and tackling climate change through 

three dimensions of sustainable 

development: economic growth, social 

inclusion and environmental protection.

We have summarised opportunities and 

risks from material ESG topics including 

how we can contribute to achieving 

the SDGs through our business and 

performance, policies and practices 

in relation to material ESG topics, as 

shown on pages 21 to 23.

1.4.4 Other ESG Topic Considerations

As mentioned earlier, in order to ensure 

that material ESG topics remain up-to-

date, we periodically review current and 

emerging megatrends, changes in the 

economic, political, regulatory and ESG 

landscape in the geographic markets 

and sectors that we operate in, along 

with the most current views of key 

stakeholders.  Thereafter, we update 

these in our assessment process.  

This includes the review of publicly 

available information and global surveys 

generated by credible sources such as 

the International Monetary Fund, UN, 

World Bank and World Economic Forum 

(“WEF”), among other sources.

One such report, the WEF’s Global 

Risks Report 2021, shares in detail 

about the extreme geoeconomic, 

geopolitical and ESG challenges that 

the world faces.

The report’s shareable infographics are 

illustrative of the views of two highly-

aware and highly-educated stakeholder 

groups on the top 10 risks over the next 

10 years in terms of both likelihood 

and impact as based on the Global 

Risks Perception Survey, completed 

by 650 members of the WEF’s diverse 

communities.

One group consists of multi-

stakeholders including academic, 

business and government leaders to 

non-profit stakeholders, while the other 

group consists of the Global Shapers 

Community, a generation of emerging 

global social entrepreneurs and leaders.

The report’s shareable infographics are 

shown on pages 25 to 26.2

In light of the pandemic, these 

stakeholder groups elevated their views 

on infectious diseases to represent 

the 4th most likely risk by likelihood 

and top global risk by impact, whereas 

in the previous year’s report which 

was issued prior to the onset of the 

2. 

“Shareable Infographics.”  Global Risks Report 2021, World Economic Forum, Marsh &amp; McLennan and Zurich Insurance Group, 19 January 2021, www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-risks-report-2021.  Accessed 28 July 2021.

pandemic, infectious diseases did 

not feature among the top 10 risks 

by likelihood, a foreshadowing of the 

world’s unpreparedness to tackle the 

challenges of the pandemic.

Elaborating on the top 10 risks by 

likelihood, apart from infectious 

diseases at 4th position, these 

stakeholder groups viewed 

environmental risks in relation to 

climate change as being of the highest 

likelihood, taking four out of the top 

five positions.  From the 6th to 10th 

positions, technological risks such as 

digital power concentration, digital 

inequality and cybersecurity failure 

dominated and took the majority of 

positions.

Elaborating on the top 10 risks by 

impact, these stakeholder groups 

viewed environmental risks in relation 

to climate change as being of the 

highest impact, taking five out of the top 

eight positions.

When looking at top risks over a time 

horizon, these stakeholder groups 

forecasted top significant short-term 

risks from societal risks caused by 

the pandemic, extreme weather and 

technological risks.  Top medium-

term risks were dominated by 

economic risks.  Top long-term risks 

were dominated by geopolitical and 

environmental risks.

Interestingly, the Global Shapers 

Community had views that are 

dominated by environmental and 

societal risks when looking at top risks 

over a time horizon, with no economic 

and geopolitical risks cited among 

top short-term risks, blind spots and 

long-term risks.  The Global Shapers 

Community forecasted top significant 

short-term risks from societal risks due 

to the pandemic and significant long-

term threats from environmental risks 

due to climate change.

INTRODUCTION

25 YEARS OF PIONEERSHIP &amp; 

TRANSFORMING ASIA’S BUILT 

ENVIRONMENT

Over Boustead Projects’ 25 years 

of pioneership and contributing to 

the transformation of Asia’s built 

environment, we have performed our 

role as a trustworthy corporate citizen, 

building businesses with a greater 

purpose – creating sustainable shared 

socio-economic value in the process – 

and developing trusting relationships 

with key stakeholders.

Regardless of how COVID-19 or any 

other major crises may change the way 

we operate, one thing is indelible – our 

distinct brand of entrepreneurialism, 

institutionalised in a corporate culture 

that links back to the Boustead 

Group’s earliest days of trading.  

Being deeply rooted in the enduring 

heritage of the Boustead Group, we 

embrace the Boustead Way, which 

prioritises the pursuit of business with 

a greater purpose.  It is about creating 

sustainable shared socio-economic 

value instead of maximising short-

term profit; promoting adaptability and 

resilience; and favouring longevity over 

sentimentality.  It is also a position, a 

value, a commercial sensibility that runs 

through every layer of our organisation.

We have generated and shared 

tremendous direct economic value and 

environmental, social and governance 

(“ESG”) benefits with key stakeholders 

including our team, clients, strategic 

partners, suppliers, lenders, 

shareholders, the media, governments 

and communities.  Since our 

establishment in 1996, our continuous 

profitability every year has enabled us to 

reinvest in creating sustainable shared 

socio-economic value and delivering 

progress to key stakeholders, laying the 

cornerstones for our long-term success 

and longevity.

A common consideration in evolving 

our business model, pioneering new 

methodologies and investing in new 

acquisitions, developments and 

geographic markets in real estate 

sectors has been based on assessing 

whether specific business expansions 

provide sustainable profit and 

simultaneously serve a greater purpose 

through the direct and indirect benefits 

shared with as many key stakeholders 

in as many economic and ESG facets 

as possible.  We have refrained from 

specific business expansions that 

could be highly profitable but yet are 

questionable on ethical and moral 

grounds, considered exploitative in 

nature, deemed as short-term and 

unsustainable to begin with or violate 

the sanctity of life.  The long and short 

of it is that business expansions must 

make good sense and instil a sense of 

good.

In line with this, our team, 

organisational ecosystem, and 

technology-driven solutions – primarily 

smart, eco-sustainable and future-

ready business park and industrial real 

estate solutions – have to inherently 

uphold the high honourable conduct 

and quality standards that have been 

associated with the Boustead Group 

for almost two centuries.  In addition, 

we embrace transformation where 

possible, in order to promptly adapt 

to new megatrends and the prevailing 

“Not all profit is equal.  Profits involving a social purpose represent a higher form of capitalism, one 

that creates a positive cycle of company and community prosperity.”

 

- 

Professor Michael Porter, renowned US academic at Harvard Business School

global landscape that has emerged over 

time.  Our pioneering achievements in 

the business park and industrial real 

estate sector are summarised on this 

page.

In FY2021, our business was 

categorised into two core revenue-

generating business segments: 

Engineering &amp; Construction (“E&amp;C”) 

(previously known as Design-and-Build) 

and Real Estate.  A third segment, 

Strategic Partnerships &amp; Investments 

generated activities which created 

value in E&amp;C and Real Estate.  These 

segments are shown on page 34.

This section covers how we are 

pursuing business with a greater 

purpose through our integrated 

industrial real estate solutions model, 

smart eco-sustainable solutions, quality, 

transformative technologies initiatives 

and generation of direct economic 

value, which are derived from the 

combined depth of all six capitals – 

financial, manufactured, intellectual, 

human, social and relationship, and 

natural – and ultimately deliver positive 

net effects for all six capitals.

2.1 INTEGRATED INDUSTRIAL REAL 

ESTATE SOLUTIONS PROVIDER

We are the only business park and 

industrial real estate solutions provider 

listed on the SGX Mainboard with an 

integrated business model and platform 

that unites all parts of the business park 

and industrial real estate value chain – 

from value-added capabilities spanning 

turnkey E&amp;C to real estate development 

management, asset management 

and fund management services, as 

shown on this page.  This significantly 

enhances our offerings to clients and 

adds greater flexibility to our structuring 

of potential development opportunities.

Our main market is in Singapore with 

a growing Asia presence in overseas 

markets including China, Malaysia and 

Vietnam, as shown on page 36.

Our integrated capabilities are 

reinforced by our excellent quality 

and environmental, health and safety

Our E&amp;C business provides turnkey engineering, project 

management and construction management services 

encompassing design-and-build methodologies for the 

business park and industrial real estate sector, helping to 

advance and shape Asia’s built environment sector.  We 

offer clients innovative real estate solutions for custom-built, 

smart, eco-sustainable and future-ready developments.

We have constructed and developed more than 3,000,000 

square metres of real estate in Singapore, China, Malaysia 

and Vietnam for clients including Fortune 500, S&amp;P 500 and 

Euronext 100 corporations across diverse sectors.

Our real estate business provides hybrid solutions in which 

we assume dual roles as the developer, owner and manager 

of leasehold properties, along with that of E&amp;C partner to 

deliver custom-built, smart, eco-sustainable and future-

ready developments.  Our market-leading capabilities have 

since expanded to include development management, asset 

management and fund management services, providing us 

with additional recurring, long-term income streams.

We have developed and grown a leasehold portfolio leased 

to a group of reputable end-user clients in Singapore, China, 

Malaysia and Vietnam.  We also recently launched Boustead 

Industrial Fund (“BIF”), our maiden full-fledged private real 

estate trust.

We have established and invested in several strategic 

partnerships and platforms to enhance our resilience, 

competitive position and geographically expand across 

Asia.  Working with like-minded, reputable and resilient 

strategic partners on several fronts has allowed us to pool 

our complementary capabilities and expertise to take on 

larger-scale projects and broaden our offerings to clients, 

while simultaneously reducing commercial and operational 

risks related to a particular geographic market, industry 

sector or real estate sector.  Activities under strategic 

partnerships also create value in our E&amp;C business and real 

estate business.

(“EHS”) track records, transformative 

technologies and outright market 

leadership in delivering smart, 

eco-sustainable and future-ready 

developments.

Our capabilities are aimed at helping 

clients to achieve highly effective 

and cost competitive solutions that 

raise efficiency and sustainability.  

Furthermore, our full-fledged IDD 

platform brings various design, 

engineering, construction, development 

and management disciplines under 

one roof and eliminates significant 

additional costs, coordination, time and 

wastage for clients, with 7D BIM as the 

centrepiece digitalisation technology 

for significantly enhanced productivity.

One of our key E&amp;C offerings is value 

engineering, the systematic design or 

redesign of a custom-built development 

to ensure that clients enjoy greater or 

similar facility performance, function 

and quality at significantly reduced 

costs.  We eliminate potential over-

design and over-construction that 

is usually present where multiple 

independent third-parties are involved.

Through value engineering, we 

continue to unlock value for clients 

with significant savings in design, 

cost, coordination, equipment, 

materials and time as compared to 

conventional construction projects 

and have changed the norms by which 

developments are delivered.

Our capabilities now include pioneering 

the introduction of smart building 

capabilities and proven transformative 

technologies in line with Industry 

4.0 transformation standards 

and the Singapore Government’s 

Industry Transformation Programme 

(“ITP”), which lays out 23 Industry 

Transformation Maps (“ITMs”) under 

six clusters to build a Future-Ready 

Singapore.1  Our direct contributions 

to the ITP are made within the ‘Built 

Environment’ cluster, while we provide 

indirect contributions to support 

transformations in other clusters – 

Essential Domestic Services, Lifestyle, 

Manufacturing, Modern Services, and 

Trade &amp; Connectivity – with solutions to 

the key players within these clusters.

2.2 SMART, ECO-SUSTAINABLE &amp; 

FUTURE-READY SOLUTIONS

Our solutions are focused on 

creating experiential and extremely 

functional spaces that are designed 

around clients’ key processes 

and requirements, where talented 

client teams from the world’s best 

corporations are placed in the ideal 

built environment to collaborate and:

• 

Give birth to new ideas and 

innovations – R&amp;D and technology 

centres;

• 

Produce solutions and technologies 

that drive the global economy – high-

tech engineering and manufacturing 

facilities;

• 

Distribute solutions and 

technologies globally – logistics 

facilities; and

• 

Provide for the flow and storage of 

vast amounts of data – data centres.

To do so, we continue to develop 

solutions that are smart and eco-

sustainable, meaning that they have 

a positive ecological impact.  ‘Eco-’ 

based on the root word ‘ecological’ is 

defined as ‘relating to or concerned 

with the relation of living organisms 

to one another and to their physical 

surroundings.’2   Our solutions are 

expected to deliver primary benefits to 

clients, usually economic in nature, and 

secondary benefits to clients and other 

key stakeholders, which transcend 

economic value into ESG benefits, with 

an overall positive bottom line over the 

long-term for the entire ecosystem that 

our solutions fit into.

This is extremely important given that 

the United Nations’ 2020 Global Status 

Report for Buildings and Construction 

states that buildings and construction 

together accounted for 35% of global 

final energy usage and 38% of global 

energy emissions in 2019, with building 

operations accounting for 55% of global 

electricity consumption.3   Furthermore, 

83% of energy-related carbon dioxide 

emissions related to buildings and 

construction are generated by the 

energy consumed when completed 

buildings are in use or what is referred 

to as operating energy.4  As such, our 

solutions which are already directly 

influencing and reducing energy loss,

emissions, pollution, and energy and 

water consumption have the potential 

to do so in the future as well during the 

highest emissions period in the multi-

decade building lifecycle.

The primary and secondary benefits, 

sector diversification and long-term 

market outlook for our solutions are 

shown on this page.

2.2.1 Solutions Supporting Economic 

Activities

Our solutions have been implemented 

to support niche segments of hard 

infrastructure, primarily business 

and industrial parks that form the 

backbone of economic activities in 

both developed and emerging markets.  

Today, our solutions integrate Industry 

4.0 transformation standards that 

increasingly support clients with their 

business activities and transformations.

2.2.2 Solutions With Additional ESG 

Benefits – Smart Green Buildings

Outside of the direct economic value 

that clients receive, our solutions also 

offer significant secondary benefits in 

ESG facets.

With the eco-sustainability practices of 

clients coming under increased scrutiny 

from their key stakeholders, we have 

been delivering solutions that help them 

to match their global growth strategies 

and better manage their ecological 

footprints, comply with environmental 

regulations and potentially collect 

data that can enhance operations and 

productivity.  Clients who embrace our 

solutions also receive social benefits 

through the ESG benefits that accrue 

to natural ecosystems and surrounding 

communities, serving to boost and 

protect their relationships and 

reputations with their key stakeholders.

Our solutions have helped clients 

to significantly reduce energy loss, 

emissions, pollution, waste, and energy 

and water consumption throughout 

the multi-decade building lifecycle.  

Our smart eco-sustainable built 

environment is conducive to create 

a healthy and productive internal 

environment for clients, while reducing 

the ecological impact on the external 

environment, particularly the natural 

ecosystem and communities.

Reporting to the Singapore 

Government’s Ministry of National 

Development, the Building &amp; 

Construction Authority (“BCA”) is the 

agency responsible for championing 

the development of an excellent 

built environment for Singapore 

and launching the BCA Green Mark 

Certification Scheme in 2005, as shown 

on page 39.

In 2009, we broke new ground with the 

delivery of Singapore’s first Green Mark 

Platinum-rated industrial development 

in the heavy industry category for 

a Fortune 500 corporation, Applied 

Materials under the BCA Green Mark 

Certification Scheme.  Since then, we 

have proceeded to become the outright

Track record updated to include 2020 BCA Green Mark Awards held in August 2020.

Platinum-rated industrial developments 

and have also delivered LEED-rated 

industrial developments under the US 

Green Building Council (“USGBC”)’s 

internationally-recognised Leadership 

in Energy &amp; Environmental Design 

(LEED) Program.  Our milestones 

include delivering Singapore’s first 

Green Mark Platinum-rated industrial 

developments in the heavy industry, 

aerospace sector and logistics sector 

categories, first Green Mark Platinum 

– Super Low Energy (“GMP-SLE”)-

rated development in the large-scale 

business park and industrial real estate 

category, and 21% and 42% of all Green 

Mark Platinum-rated new private sector 

industrial developments and logistics 

developments respectively on Business 

1 and Business 2 industrial-zoned land, 

as shown on this page.5

In FY2021, we continued to build our 

landmark largest private sector project 

for Surbana Jurong Campus (“SJC”), 

which was Singapore’s first GMP-SLE-

rated development in the large-scale 

business park and industrial real estate 

sector category at the BCA Green Mark 

Awards 2019 held in May 2019.  SJC is 

a huge step towards minimal to zero 

carbon footprints and an exemplary 

project on how building design can 

mitigate climate change.  Introduced in 

2018, the GMP-SLE rating is the BCA’s 

latest higher benchmark for best-in-

class green buildings in Singapore.  SJC 

achieved the GMP-SLE with significant 

eco-sustainability features geared 

towards the highest levels of energy 

efficiency and huge reductions in 

energy usage.

During FY2021, at the BCA Green Mark 

Awards 2020 held in August 2020, 

our fourth project for DB Schenker 

in Singapore – DB Schenker Red 

Lion – was awarded the Green Mark 

Platinum.  Separately, ASM Front-End 

Manufacturing and Razer SEA HQ were 

awarded the Green Mark Gold Plus, 

while Bombardier Singapore Service 

Centre Phase 2 was awarded the Green 

Mark Gold.

As the outright market leader in the 

E&amp;C of smart, eco-sustainable and 

future-ready developments, we are 

taking our commitment further to 

attain higher Green Mark ratings in our 

role as a developer for multi-tenanted 

developments that we intend to own 

and lease out in Singapore.  In line 

with this, we designed and built our 

headquarters – Edward Boustead 

Centre – to attain Green Mark Platinum 

in 2015, leading by example and 

showcasing to clients how extensive 

green building features can be 

incorporated into the design of all future 

buildings.  Similarly, the same path was 

taken for ALICE, which was awarded 

the Green Mark Platinum in 2018.  In

smart development – 351 on Braddell – 

incorporates a number of smart eco-

sustainable features.  Moving forward, 

we will continue to explore ways to 

further introduce smart eco-sustainable 

solutions into our leasehold portfolio 

including the introduction of the Green 

Lease Scheme at our multi-tenanted 

developments in Singapore.

At the end of FY2021, we secured 

an E&amp;C contract from Fortune 500 

corporation, Takeda to deliver their 

four-floor office building, earmarked to 

achieve Green Mark Platinum – Zero 

Energy (“GMP-ZE”).  This project is 

intended to serve as a model for other 

future GMP-ZE-rated projects where 

buildings generate enough energy from 

renewable energy sources to be self-

sufficient and without drawing energy 

from the power grid, representing the 

ideal built environment to promote 

climate resilience.

In working towards the promotion 

of Green Mark Platinum-rated 

developments, our focus is on attaining 

high levels of energy and water usage 

efficiency, environmental protection, 

environmental quality and other green 

features.  Many of the Green Mark 

Platinum-rated developments we 

have delivered incorporate the eco-

sustainable features shown on this 

page.

2.2.3 Strategic Technology 

Partnerships to Strengthen Smart 

Eco-Sustainable Solutions

During FY2021, we continued to 

strengthen our solutions through 

progressing on collaborations with 

three strategic technology partners: 

DSCO, Getronics and Sunseap.  These 

strategic technology partnerships were 

initiated in FY2020.

A 25% shareholding was acquired in 

DSCO, a provider of specialised building 

engineering consulting services in the 

Asia Pacific, with a strong reputation 

as a leading designer of data centres.  

We expect our strategic investment 

in DSCO to support future expansion 

and augment E&amp;C and development 

capabilities in high-tech, high value-

added sectors and intend to leverage 

DSCO’s expertise, experience and 

reputable position in the high-growth 

data centre sector to jointly pursue data 

centre developments.

Our collaboration with Getronics – a 

leading global infocommunications 

technology service provider – is 

intended to enable us to deliver 

next generation smart buildings by 

leveraging Getronics’ technologies 

and to augment our integrated suite 

of transformative digital real estate 

solutions addressing the entire 

multi-decade lifecycle of buildings.  

Getronics’ smart technologies will help 

future-proof our development projects 

with a flexible and scalable platform for 

new and ever-changing technologies, 

allowing us to manage smart 

developments in our leasehold portfolio 

on a single technology platform.

During FY2021, development of the 

platform was completed, with ongoing 

user testing of the platform at ALICE.  

The capabilities of the platform will 

allow building owners, external service 

providers, facility managers and 

tenants to interact seamlessly by digital

means, provide data-driven insights 

to key building stakeholders and unify 

frontend tenant-facing systems with 

disparate and siloed backend building, 

facilities and Internet of Things (“IoT”) 

management systems.

Our collaboration with Sunseap – the 

largest and most established integrated 

clean energy solutions company 

in Singapore – is for the potential 

installation of rooftop industrial solar 

energy systems at our real estate 

projects and potential provision of 

lower-cost clean energy solutions to our 

clients and tenants.  This partnership 

aims to better utilise rooftop space – an 

important asset within our leasehold 

portfolio.  Promoting eco-sustainability 

through greater use of renewable 

energy aligns with our position as the 

market-leading builder and developer of 

smart, eco-sustainable and future-ready 

developments.

During FY2021, we initiated 

introductions of Sunseap to tenants 

within our leasehold portfolio, with 

at least two major tenants of single-

tenanted properties advancing in 

negotiations with Sunseap to install 

rooftop industrial solar energy systems 

at our properties and commit to 

powering operations with clean energy.

2.3 QUALITY

Quality has always been a defining 

factor in the total client experience.  

As part of our Quality Management 

System (“QMS”) which includes 

quality assurance and improvement 

programmes, we first embarked on ISO 

9001 certification in 1999 and have had 

a QMS in place ever since.  In March 

2016, our principal E&amp;C subsidiary in 

Singapore, Boustead Projects E&amp;C (“BP 

E&amp;C”) received an upgrade to the latest 

ISO 9001:2015 standard and in April 

2021, recertified under the standard.

Our QMS sets out quality management 

system enablers, commitments, targets 

and responsibilities for our team, with 

overriding responsibility belonging to 

our Audit &amp; Improvement Team headed 

by our Director of Audit &amp; Improvement, 

a member of our senior management 

team.  Our QMS is both externally 

and internally audited, and ensures 

quality management performance at all 

workplaces and project sites under our 

control on a daily basis.

As the delivery of quality is emphasised 

throughout all potential client touch 

points, our solutions are not always 

the lowest priced among competing 

solutions but do consistently deliver 

high quality client experiences and 

outcomes.  Due to positive client 

experiences and outcomes, numerous 

clients have become repeat clients 

which is important in the context where 

almost all client relationships are 

business-to-business arrangements 

involving a smaller client base but 

larger transactional value as compared 

to what is typically seen in business-

to-consumer arrangements.  The 

embedding of quality into all potential 

client touch points is extremely 

important since a client’s project 

journey together with us typically lasts 

for over one year and is made up of 

thousands of interactions between key 

stakeholders, especially between our 

team and clients, strategic partners, 

suppliers, lenders, government 

agencies and regulators, all within a 

single project.

2.3.1 Quality, Domain Expertise &amp; 

Project Track Records as Client 

Prequalifiers

Our clients range from reputable small 

and medium-sized enterprises to global 

clients including Fortune 500, S&amp;P 500 

and Euronext 100 corporations.  Given 

the strong brand reputation of our 

clients and potential clients, there are 

usually more stringent expectations on 

quality, domain expertise and project 

track records since our solutions 

have such a significant impact on the 

achievement of clients’ global growth 

strategies and their relationships with 

their key stakeholders.  Many clients 

conduct financial, quality, EHS and 

project track record reviews on our 

business and at times, those of our 

suppliers, before prequalifying and 

inviting us to submit proposals, bids and 

tenders for potential projects.  Once we 

become a prequalified main contractor 

to a specific client, we are routinely 

invited to submit proposals, bids and 

tenders for potential projects whenever 

the specific client reviews a potential 

new investment or project in Singapore 

and sometimes internationally.

In addition, BP E&amp;C is approved by the 

BCA for Grade CW01-A1 and General 

Builder Class 1 Licence to execute 

building construction contracts of 

unlimited value in the private and public 

sectors.6  This removes the limit on the 

size of contracts that we can undertake 

in Singapore.

2.3.2 Construction Awards &amp; 

Construction Quality Assessment 

System

We are a regular feature at the BCA 

Awards, an annual awards programme 

hosted by the BCA to recognise the best 

in building and construction practices 

and projects.

During FY2021, at the BCA Awards 

2020 held in August 2020, DB Schenker 

Red Lion was awarded the Green Mark 

Platinum.  Separately, ASM Front-End 

Manufacturing and Razer SEA HQ were 

awarded the Green Mark Gold Plus, 

while Bombardier Singapore Service 

Centre Phase 2 was awarded the Green 

Mark Gold.

To date, our construction excellence, 

quality, productivity and eco-sustainable 

efforts have been recognised with 34 

construction-related and Green Mark 

awards at the BCA Awards, as shown 

on pages 43 to 44.

In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has 

exponentially accelerated the necessity 

of transformation globally, with 

those unable to adapt and transform 

immediately, facing an existential 

threat greater than any seen in recent 

memory.

2.4.1 Industry 4.0

According to Boston Consulting 

Group (“BCG”), Industry 4.0 – the 

fourth industrial revolution – affects 

every manufacturing domain and 

comprises advanced manufacturing 

technologies that capture, manage 

and optimise data.  In simple terms, 

Industry 4.0 makes manufacturing 

‘smart’.  Technologies such as artificial 

intelligence (“AI”), cyber-physical 

systems and industrial IoT interact 

seamlessly, and communicate and 

modify continuously.  Businesses that 

fully understand and capture the value 

of these advantages are best positioned 

to take on the challenges that lie 

ahead.8   BCG went on to name nine 

technologies that are driving Industry 

4.0.  We have overlaid our already 

implemented technologies in seven of 

these areas, as shown on this page.

For 25 years, we have been a pioneering 

force in Singapore’s industrial 

real estate sector, demonstrating 

pioneership and transformation in 

business model and activities including 

design-and-build (1996), design-build-

and-lease (2003), advanced eco-

sustainable buildings (2009) and IDD 

(2017), among others.

As the latest capability in our pioneering 

approach, our full-fledged IDD platform 

is guided by Industry 4.0 transformation 

standards and deploys digitalisation 

and Cloud-based technology platforms 

for 7D building information modelling 

(“BIM”), virtual design and construction 

(“VDC”), and design for manufacturing 

and assembly (“DfMA”).  Our 

progressive adoption of transformative 

technologies – known as ConTech 

and PropTech – includes 3D scanning, 

AI and machine learning, augmented 

reality (“AR”) and virtual reality (“VR”), 

data analytics and drone technology, as 

shown on this page.

In 2017, our extensive deployment of 

IDD began in ALICE, along with the 

adoption of many of the methodologies 

mentioned earlier.  As our largest 

development on record, ALICE’s design, 

project management, construction 

and site management, and delivery 

were run on the IDD platform, further 

complemented by our use of drones 

for aerial imaging, site progress 

and surveillance, and eventually the 

adoption of VR for collaboration across 

project stakeholders.  ALICE was 

constructed virtually using BIM and 

VDC (before the actual construction) so 

that most issues could be anticipated 

during construction, operations 

and maintenance, and proactive 

solutions could be generated, thereby 

significantly boosting productivity.  

Another first in the sector, ALICE 

adopted large-scale prefabricated 

bathroom units (“PBUs”) using 

prefabricated, prefinished volumetric 

construction (“PPVC”), the first large-

scale PBUs in the built environment 

sector. 

During FY2021, on the operational side, 

ALICE has been the testbed for our 

collaboration with Getronics, with the 

official launch for the single technology 

platform approach in progress.  The 

platform aims to greatly automate 

processes, reduce manual tasks and 

significantly improve the experiential 

process for all building stakeholders.

Please review our Industry 4.0 Future-

Ready Feature on ALICE, as shown 

on page 48, along with a summary of 

how we are converging the ideals of 

the Singapore Government’s ITP and 

ITMs for three sectors: construction, 

real estate and infocomm media, as 

shown on page 49.  Simultaneously, we 

are using IDD and proven technologies 

to reshape smart, eco-sustainable and 

future-ready developments for clients 

shifting into Industry 4.0 under their 

respective ITMs.

During the pandemic, technology 

also played a key role in mitigating 

risks associated with the pandemic, 

allowing for highly collaborative 

activities including IDD, design, value 

engineering and construction to be 

conducted in a productive and safe 

manner.  Our IDD Team continued 

to push forward with transformative 

technologies implementation, scaling 

new heights with digitalisation and 

strengthening value propositions in 

7D BIM.  Through use cases ongoing 

in at least three projects, 7D BIM was 

demonstrated to show the following 

real benefits:

• 

Digital progress documentation 

reduced the risk of late claims and 

disputes;

• 

Clients and senior leadership could 

conduct virtual project site visits 

and review ongoing construction 

activities without having to physically 

visit project sites, saving the need 

for additional logistics, swab testing, 

time and travelling, and keeping 

them well, healthy and safe;

• 

Project management progress 

updates could be remotely 

conducted offsite and still allow 

for key issues to be identified 

and rectified, while potential 

miscommunications were 

significantly reduced; and

• 

EHS 360-degree virtual reports 

delivered remote visualisation 

capabilities, allowing for timely EHS 

interventions.

and VR and Cloud-based technology 

platforms to review virtual 7D BIM 

models simultaneously, without the 

need for stakeholders to be present in 

the same room.  Overall, virtual project 

site visits saved about 500 man-hours 

per month per project in potential 

miscommunications and significantly 

reduced the risks to stakeholders’ 

wellbeing, health and safety, while 

lowering the potential for government 

enforced lockdowns of specific project 

sites due to infected stakeholders 

entering.

Technologies were also implemented 

to enhance onsite safe management 

measures – among the world’s strictest 

– at project sites.  In a partnership 

with TraceSafe under the Open 

Innovation Platform, we outfitted our 

team and subcontractors’ employees 

at one project site with TraceSafe’s 

wearable safety devices.  Attached to 

helmets, these devices can withstand 

the rugged conditions of the built 

environment sector and are able to 

provide real-time contact tracing, safe 

distancing and geofencing capabilities 

onsite.  These devices send signals to 

individual workers when they breach 

safe boundaries of separated work 

zones or are too close to one another, 

making everybody onsite safer.  With 

the successful implementation at the 

first project site, TraceSafe is now in the 

process of being rolled out across all 

project sites.

During FY2021, our transformative 

technologies continued to be best 

displayed at our largest E&amp;C project 

on record for JTC Kranji Green.  With 

the ongoing construction of JTC Kranji 

Green, we were able to implement a 

number of transformative technologies 

and methodologies that can be applied 

towards other projects in the future.  

Chief among these has been the 

opportunity to execute full-fledged IDD, 

VDC and DfMA, and pilot technology 

partnerships to accomplish 7D BIM 

on an extremely large-scale industrial 

development.  Extensive use of DfMA 

and PPVC components for JTC Kranji 

Green has demonstrated our capability 

to work with some of the largest PPVC 

components involved in any industrial 

development.  We were able to achieve 

a very high level of IDD adoption within 

this project, which includes:

• 

Improving project planning 

and tracking by aggregating all 

scheduling and construction data 

into a single Cloud-based platform;

• 

Significantly optimising design 

approvals through virtual 

walkthroughs of BIM with project 

stakeholders; and

• 

Working towards a digital operations 

and maintenance manual for the 

development, which will see the 

final as-built 7D BIM used for multi-

decade facilities management – a 

first of its kind in Asia.

With significant investments in 

transformative technologies, we expect 

higher productivity, more effective 

project management, and better quality 

and defects management to ultimately 

translate into greater savings for our 

projects over the long-term.

2.4.2 Climate Change

Opening for signatures on 22 April 2016 

– Earth Day – at the UN Headquarters in 

New York, the Paris Agreement entered 

into force on 4 November 2016 and has 

been ratified by 191 out of 197 parties 

to the Convention to date.  The Paris 

Agreement brings together all nations 

in an extremely important common 

goal to combat climate change and 

adapt to its effects, with the aim of 

keeping global temperature rise this 

century at well below 2°C above pre-

industrial levels and pursue efforts to 

limit temperature increase even further 

to 1.5°C.9   The Singapore Government 

ratified the Paris Agreement on 21 

September 2016.

In line with this, we acknowledge 

that we have a shared responsibility 

as a responsible corporate citizen to 

work towards uplifting our business 

in material ESG topics, especially in 

relation to the building, construction 

and real estate sectors.  Given the 

high energy intensity and emissions 

contributed by these sectors, we aim 

to promote our solutions, as previously 

shown on pages 37 to 42.

As mentioned earlier, we provide 

solutions that have the potential to 

directly influence and reduce energy 

loss, emissions, pollution, and energy 

and water consumption in some of the 

most energy-intensive sectors, and 

work towards the extremely important 

common goal to combat climate 

change, build climate resilience and 

protect the natural ecosystem.

More information on our performance, 

policies and processes in relation 

to climate change will be shared in 

Section 4 of this report.

In 2018, we secured JTC Kranji Green, 

located in the Sungei Kadut Eco-

District.  The project has been touted 

as one of the Singapore Government’s 

landmark projects to shift the nation 

increasingly towards the circular 

economy, where maximum value is 

extracted from resources through 

recovery, recycling and regeneration.  

The project is earmarked to be awarded 

the Green Mark Platinum and will be 

Singapore’s first multi-storey recycling 

facility to house recyclers handling

waste streams like metals, paper and 

plastics. The project will support the 

growth of environmental technologies 

and contribute towards Singapore’s 

zero waste commitments, facilitating 

the recycling of industrial wastes and 

by-products, as well as supporting 

sector transformation.  With extremely 

limited space and landfill capacity – 

currently confined to Semakau Island 

– the Singapore Government has been 

reviewing major initiatives to boost 

recycling infrastructure in the most 

efficient and cost-effective manner.  

We are proud to be participating in a 

national project of strategic importance 

in Singapore’s contributions to combat 

climate change, build climate resilience, 

protect the natural ecosystem and solve 

a pressing waste storage problem.

2.4.3 COVID-19 &amp; Infectious Disease 

Outbreaks

During FY2021, the pandemic’s rapid 

spread in a very short period of time 

took the world by surprise, representing 

the greatest risk to the world in recent 

times.  While some countries have 

successfully contained the pandemic 

through extremely strict lockdowns, 

safe distancing measures, travel 

restrictions and effective vaccine 

roll-out programmes, these countries 

remain in the minority, with most of 

the world still struggling to contain 

the pandemic, bring average daily 

infections under control and increase 

vaccination rates.

COVID-19 is unlikely to be categorised 

as a megatrend.  However, the scale of 

the disruption caused by the pandemic 

already entails long-term implications 

for the world, from the strategies and 

activities of governments, sectors 

and organisations right through to 

communities and individuals, many who 

may be our stakeholders in countries 

where we operate.  Lessons from the 

pandemic are likely to be applied to 

the control of future infectious disease 

outbreaks.  At this juncture, there are 

already suggestions that this pandemic 

may become endemic.

In line with this, we acknowledge 

COVID-19 and infectious disease 

outbreaks as a material ESG 

topic, which is directly impacting 

our businesses and those of our 

stakeholders.

More information on our performance, 

policies and processes in relation to 

COVID-19 will be shared in Section 3 of 

this report.

2.5 FY2021 DIRECT ECONOMIC 

VALUE GENERATION &amp; 

DISTRIBUTION

Our continuous profitability every year 

has enabled us to reinvest in creating 

sustainable shared socio-economic 

value and delivering progress to key 

stakeholders, laying the cornerstones 

for our long-term success and longevity.

In FY2021, S$446.8 million in direct 

economic value (“EV”) was generated, a 

5% increase year-on-year as compared 

to S$425.7 million in FY2020, which 

was shared among key stakeholders 

as shown on page 53.  Our direct EV 

generated since FY2018 is as shown on 

this page.

We have built a fundamentally-sound 

balance sheet, reinvested in business 

expansions and our growing leasehold 

portfolio and continue to have the 

capability to make new acquisitions and 

investments.

Wholly-owned properties under 

our leasehold portfolio contribute 

relatively stable leasing revenue and 

profit under our Real Estate business 

segment that has gradually grown 

over time and provides a base to our 

financial performance, along with

complementing our E&amp;C activities.

Jointly-owned properties under our 

investments in associated companies 

and joint ventures contribute to 

profit under our Real Estate business 

segment, once major jointly-owned 

properties reach asset stabilisation.

2.5.1 Boustead Industrial Fund Value-

Unlocking

During FY2021, we successfully 

launched BIF, our maiden full-fledged 

private real estate trust.  Strategically, 

BIF has transformed our business 

model and integrated platform to 

unite all parts of the industrial real 

estate value chain – from value-

added capabilities spanning turnkey 

E&amp;C to real estate development 

management, asset management 

and fund management services.  This 

significantly enhances our offerings to 

clients and adds greater flexibility to our 

structuring of potential development 

opportunities.

The total BIF value-unlocking 

transaction one-off gain was S$134.8 

million, recorded following our sale of 

interests in 14 leasehold properties 

to BIF – full disposal of 11 properties 

and partial disposal of equity interests 

in a subsidiary and two joint ventures 

– selected from our portfolio of 25 

leasehold properties.  We continue 

to hold 100% shareholding of BIF’s 

manager and 25% unitholding of BIF, 

which will allow us to benefit from the 

expansion and growth of BIF in the 

future.  Holding the manager role, our 

Real Estate business segment will 

be entitled to management fees and 

property management fees, similar to 

what listed real estate investment trust 

(“REIT”) managers would receive for 

managing their respective listed REITs.

Even as the bulk of our wholly-owned 

properties has now been sold into BIF, 

we still retain a pipeline of properties 

– mainly under joint ventures – with 

over S$700 million in expected market 

valuation.  Once assets in Singapore 

are stabilised, they will potentially be 

ready for injection into BIF.  We expect 

properties to be progressively injected 

into BIF at a steady pace, with our 

remaining eligible properties enlarging 

BIF over several years.

2.5.2 Financial Performance &amp; 

Dividends

FY2017 was our first complete 

financial year following our listing on 

the SGX Mainboard in April 2015 and 

also marked our inaugural dividend 

payments to shareholders.  Since 

then, we have made annual dividend 

payments to shareholders, which has 

continued for a fifth successive year.  In 

addition, with the value-unlocking event 

from BIF, our Board was able to propose 

a record dividend consisting of a final 

dividend of 0.9 cents per share and 

special dividend of 14.5 cents per share, 

for a total dividend of 15.4 cents per 

share for FY2021, which was approved 

by our shareholders at the Annual 

General Meeting held on 28 July 2021 

and has since been paid out.

The value-unlocking event from BIF also 

allowed us to report a record net profit 

– surpassing the S$100 million mark 

for the first time – and resulting in the 

strongest balance sheet in our history.

Our five-year financial performance 

summary is shown on pages 55 to 56.

INTRODUCTION

A PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE BUSINESS

An organisation is only as good as its 

people.  At Boustead Projects, this is 

absolutely true.

We are a knowledge-driven, business-

to-business and people-to-people 

organisation, where achieving our 

mission, vision and long-term objectives 

are highly dependent on the values, 

conduct and performance of our best 

asset – our team.

Our team is expected to demonstrate 

our five human-centric corporate 

values – integrity, professionalism, 

perseverance, flexibility and passion – 

in interactions with key stakeholders.  

Developing a high-performance team 

capable of delivering our technology-

driven solutions, primarily smart, 

eco-sustainable and future-ready 

business park and industrial real 

estate developments, aligned with our 

fundamental principles and strong 

human-centric corporate values, 

strengthens our trusted partnerships 

with client teams at many of the world’s 

best corporations.  This helps our 

clients to transform their sectors, build 

their next stage of growth, derive true 

value from their sizeable investments 

and deliver direct economic value 

and environmental, social and 

governance (“ESG”) benefits to their key 

stakeholders, while keeping us at the 

forefront of our sector.

A client’s project journey together with 

us typically lasts for over one year and 

is made up of thousands of interactions 

between key stakeholders, especially 

between our team and clients, 

strategic partners, suppliers, lenders, 

government agencies and regulators, all 

within a single project.  As our business 

ambassadors, our team is the first 

ranking enabler of developing trusting 

relationships with key stakeholders and 

the main contributor to our long-term 

success and longevity.  All systems, 

policies and processes (together 

“system enablers”) are there to support 

a high-performance team capable 

of meeting the expectations of key 

stakeholders.

Being rooted in the enduring heritage of 

the Boustead Group, the Boustead Way 

and other fundamental principles have 

been passed down from generation to 

generation that continue to guide our 

daily actions and decisions.  We believe 

in acting honourably in the way that 

we conduct business and staying true 

to our strong human-centric corporate 

values.  We have zero tolerance for 

accidents, bribery, corruption, fraud 

and violence.  We do not condone the 

use of child or forced labour, whether 

at project sites under our direct control 

or project sites under our fabricators, 

subcontractors and suppliers 

(together “suppliers”)’s control.  We 

believe in providing our team with fair 

employment and human rights.

This section covers our Code of 

Conduct, Team Development 

Programme, positive work environment 

and supply chain management which 

are mainly derived from the combined 

depth of three capitals – intellectual, 

human, and social and relationship 

– and ultimately deliver positive net 

effects for all six capitals.  In addition, in 

a continuation from FY2020, the topic 

of COVID-19 and infectious disease 

outbreaks is included.

INTRODUCTION

3.1 CODE OF CONDUCT

We are highly committed to building 

a climate of fairness, honesty, trust 

and sincerity with key stakeholders, 

beginning with our team’s honourable 

conduct.  Our Code of Conduct (“COC”) 

sets the foundation for our daily actions 

and decisions, and helps our team to 

adhere to the highest standards of 

honourable conduct.

Our team members are inducted in, 

updated on and expected to adhere to 

our COC as a condition of employment, 

with orientation briefings when new 

team members join, followed by annual 

acknowledgements and reviews of our 

COC.  Policies on anti-bribery and anti-

corruption (“ABAC”), fair dealing and 

competition, proper use of corporate 

positions and resources, confidentiality 

and privacy obligations, insider trading 

and whistle-blowing are covered in our 

COC, among other guidance areas on 

honourable conduct, as shown on this 

page.

3.1.1 Anti-Bribery &amp; Anti-Corruption

We have zero tolerance for bribery 

and corruption.  We expect our team 

and all third-parties whom we have 

business dealings with to comply 

with Singapore’s Prevention of 

Corruption Act (Chapter 241) and all 

applicable ABAC laws and regulations 

in countries where we operate.  Our 

team members are bound by our ABAC 

Policy regardless of whether they are 

employed in Singapore, stationed 

overseas or employed outside of 

Singapore.  We may also be required 

to comply with applicable foreign 

ABAC laws and regulations imposed in 

business dealings with multinational 

clients who are headquartered in a 

foreign country where we have no 

operational presence.

3.1.2 Fair Dealing &amp; Competition

We engage only in fair and vigorous 

competition.  We expect our team 

members to fairly deal and interact 

with fellow team members, clients and 

competitors, and not to take unfair 

advantage of all third-parties whom 

we have business dealings with.  This 

includes avoiding abuse of confidential 

or privileged information, concealment, 

illegal conduct, manipulation, 

misrepresentation of material facts, 

undue influence or any other unfair 

dealing practices.

3.1.3 Proper Use of Corporate 

Positions &amp; Resources

We expect our team members to 

apply and use corporate positions and 

resources in a responsible manner, 

which broadly includes duties to act in 

good faith and in our best interests as a 

whole.

3.1.4 Confidentiality, Data Protection 

&amp; Privacy

Information is a valuable asset, 

particularly in our knowledge-driven 

business model.  In the ordinary course 

of business, we may receive clients’ 

confidential data, in which case we may 

be subject to various non-disclosure 

agreements and confidentiality 

clauses.  Clients expect us to abide by 

confidentiality obligations, exposing 

us to a wide range of risks from non-

compliance.  In addition, we have to 

comply with Singapore’s Personal 

Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) 

that requires organisations that 

collect, use or disclose personal data 

to abide by PDPA requirements, again 

exposing us to a wide range of risks 

from non-compliance.  We have also 

been briefed on the General Data 

Protection Regulation, which regulates 

the processing by any individual, 

corporation or organisation of personal 

data relating to individuals in the EU.

We are highly committed to adhering 

with all confidentiality obligations, 

applicable data protection, privacy 

laws and regulations in countries 

where we operate.  Our data protection 

and IT system enablers ensure that 

information assets are properly 

governed, managed and secured both 

in digital and physical environments.  

This allows us to effectively comply 

with confidentiality, data protection and 

privacy obligations over the long-term.

FRAMEWORK

INTRODUCTION

In data protection, we have 

implemented a Data Protection 

Governance Framework (“DPG 

Framework”) that covers governance 

principles, structure and system 

enablers.  We opted for a governance 

structure with centralised formulation 

of system enablers and decentralised 

implementation of system enablers.  

Our Data Protection Committee (“DPC”) 

comprising our senior management 

team, functional heads and key 

executives has overall responsibility 

for the effective implementation of 

system enablers, while appointed Data 

Protection Officers (“DPOs”) coordinate 

activities.  Our DPOs also act as the 

external interface with the general 

public.  Other than our DPC and DPOs, 

team members are also briefed and 

trained to understand the PDPA and 

our DPG Framework including any 

department data and information flows 

that may require protection.

Policies for IT, information security, 

external data protection, internal data 

protection, document retention and 

third-party outsourcing are covered in 

our DPG Framework and reviewed by 

our senior management team and DPC 

at least once every two years.

In addition, we took a further step to 

implement an Information Security 

Management System (“ISMS”).  In 

2019, our principal Engineering &amp; 

Construction (“E&amp;C”) subsidiary 

in Singapore, Boustead Projects 

E&amp;C (“BP E&amp;C”), first embarked on 

and received ISO/IEC 27001:2013 

certification.  Our ISMS sets out 

information security management 

system enablers, commitments, targets 

and responsibilities for our team, with 

joint overriding responsibility belonging 

to our IT, Human Resource (“HR”) 

and Environmental, Health and Safety 

(“EHS”) Teams.  Our IT, HR and EHS 

Teams manage all aspects of our ISMS 

which is both externally and internally 

audited, and ensure information 

security management performance at 

all of our workplaces and project sites 

under control on a daily basis.

During FY2021, we had no 

substantiated complaints on breaches 

of client privacy, which was the same in 

FY2018, FY2019 and FY2020, as shown 

on this page.  This is in line with our 

perpetual target for zero breaches of 

client privacy.

3.1.5 Insider Trading

We expect our team members with 

access to price-sensitive information 

to comply with Singapore’s Securities 

&amp; Futures Act (Chapter 289) and 

insider trading laws and regulations.  

Team members with access to price-

sensitive information are not allowed to 

trade in Boustead Projects’ securities 

on short-term considerations and in 

the one month before semi-annual 

financial results announcements, 

ending only after release of relevant 

announcements.  Team members 

are reminded on a semi-annual basis 

to comply with trading blackout 

periods and insider trading laws and 

regulations.

3.1.6 Whistle-Blowing Mechanism

Implemented in 2008, our whistle-

blowing mechanism allows our team 

members and all third-parties to 

raise and report in good faith and 

in confidence, any concerns about 

possible misconduct in financial 

reporting matters or suspected bribery, 

corruption, fraud and dishonourable 

conduct.  Procedures are in place 

to ensure that whistle-blowers are 

protected.

More information on our Whistle-

Blowing Policy is available within the 

Boustead Projects Limited FY2021 

Annual Report on page 79.

During FY2021, we had no reported 

incidents of whistle-blowing, which was 

the same in FY2020, as shown on this 

page.

COC violations will result in appropriate 

disciplinary actions being taken against 

the violating team member including 

potential dismissal and referral to 

legal authorities for serious violations 

that may be illegal.  A compliance 

plan sets forth how our COC is to be 

implemented and monitored including 

how violations are detected, reported 

and investigated, as well as follow-up 

actions to be taken.

3.2 TEAM DEVELOPMENT 

PROGRAMME

The purpose of our Team Development 

Programme (“TDP”) is to attract, 

develop, motivate and retain team 

members with values, attitudes, skillsets 

and work practices aligned with our 

mission, vision, strong human-centric 

corporate values and high-performance 

team culture.  Our TDP is structured 

to create a work environment that 

promotes creativity, excitement and 

growth, and make team members feel 

cared for, challenged, empowered 

and respected.  Our TDP sets out 

human resource management (“HRM”) 

system enablers, commitments, targets 

and responsibilities for our team, 

with implementation responsibility 

belonging to our HR Team headed by 

our Deputy Director of HR, a member of 

our extended management team.  Our 

HR Team provides HRM leadership and 

support to all subsidiaries regionally.

We have always embraced diversity 

in our team, a trait we inherited from 

the Boustead Group.  This diversity 

has not just been in terms of gender 

balance but also in age, race, religion, 

marital status, family responsibilities, 

work experience and nationality, with 

a multi-cultural and multi-faceted team 

mainly from Singapore and other parts 

of South East Asia.

During FY2021, our overall team size 

shrank 3% or 6 team members to 271 

team members, compared to 277 team 

members in FY2020, the breakdown 

as shown on page 61.  Most of the 

overall team size reduction was due 

to streamlining of our Engineering 

&amp; Construction (“E&amp;C”) Team in 

Singapore in light of the COVID-19 

pandemic and its adverse impact on 

Singapore projects, balanced off by 

growth in team sizes in China and 

Malaysia to conduct greater E&amp;C 

activities in these countries.

The overall team gender balance 

ratio improved 1% year-on-year, with 

female team members making up 

30% of our overall team, which was 

above the comparable sectors gender 

balance average (&lt;30%) but below the 

Singapore average (37%), Asia Pacific 

average (34%) and global average (37%) 

in 2020, as shown on page 61.  In terms 

of the managerial gender balance ratio, 

female team members made up 17% 

of our total managerial team members, 

almost in line with the Asia Pacific 

average (18%) but below the global 

average (24%) in 2020.1

3.2.1 Talent Attraction

As part of our TDP, we are highly 

committed to complying with 

Singapore’s Employment Act and 

all applicable employment laws and 

regulations in countries where we 

operate.  We are further committed 

to fair, responsible and progressive 

employment practices and strive to 

adopt the latest HRM best practices, 

which is essential to attracting the 

right talent to contribute to our long-

term success and longevity.  Our 

team members are considered to 

be employed by us only within the 

context and terms of their employment 

contracts.

a) The Employers’ Pledge of Fair 

Employment Practices

Singapore’s Tripartite Alliance for Fair 

&amp; Progressive Employment Practices 

(“TAFEP”) promotes the adoption 

of fair, responsible and progressive 

employment practices among 

employers, employees and the general 

public. Boustead Projects E&amp;C, our 

principal E&amp;C subsidiary and also the 

management services arm of Boustead 

Projects is among the over 14,000 

signatories to the TAFEP’s Employers’ 

Pledge of Fair Employment Practices 

(“Pledge”).2

Under the Pledge, we have committed 

to work towards fair employment 

practices including:

• 

Recruiting and selecting employees 

on the basis of merit, regardless of 

age, race, gender, religion, marital 

status and family responsibilities or 

disability;

• 

Treating employees fairly and 

with respect, and implementing 

progressive HRM systems;

• 

Providing employees with fair 

opportunity to be considered for 

training and development based on 

their strengths and needs to help 

them achieve their full potential;

• 

Rewarding employees fairly based 

on their ability, performance, 

contribution and experience; and

• 

Complying with the labour laws and 

adopting the Tripartite Guidelines on 

Fair Employment Practices.

FRAMEWORK

INTRODUCTION

Apart from the Pledge, we promote 

gender equality at the workplace.  

In terms of talent attraction, this 

means that we offer the same 

basic remuneration package to all 

interviewing job candidates for a 

specific role and scope, regardless of 

gender or whether a job candidate has 

served Singapore’s mandatory national 

service.

b) Other Talent Attraction Practices

We generally advertise available 

positions both externally and 

internally, although recruitment 

for certain sensitive key positions 

may be conducted anonymously 

through professional recruitment 

agencies.  Where possible, we seek 

to employ citizens from countries 

where we operate.  Since 2014, we 

have also adhered to Singapore’s 

Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”)’s Fair 

Consideration Framework that requires 

available positions – unless exempted 

– to be advertised on MyCareersFuture 

for at least 14 days, thereby giving 

citizens fair and non-discriminatory 

consideration for all job opportunities 

before considering foreign 

professionals to fill these positions.3

Adding to our talent pool, through 

Boustead Singapore Limited, we were 

one of 16 sponsoring organisations 

within the engineering sector

participating in the Singapore-Industry 

Scholarship (“SgIS”) Programme.  

Launched in 2012 and co-funded by 

both the Singapore Government and 

private sector organisations, Boustead 

Singapore Limited was a founding 

private sector organisation within the 

SgIS, a multi-sector undergraduate 

scholarship programme that aims to 

groom future Singaporean leaders in 

strategic sectors that are critical for 

the country’s development.  To date, 

we have given scholarships to three 

individuals, all of whom have since 

completed their local university degree 

programmes and joined us in full-time 

capacities.

As mentioned earlier, during FY2021, 

our overall team size shrank 3% year-

on-year, comparing favourably with 

the reductions in both Singapore’s 

comparable sectors employment 

average (-11.1%) and national average 

(-4.8%) in 2020.  Similarly, our monthly 

team hiring rate of 3.0% compared 

favourably with both Singapore’s 

comparable sectors monthly hiring 

average (1.0%) and national average 

(1.6%) in 2020, as shown on page 63.4

Our reduction in overall team size was 

partially buffered by the hiring of 102 

new team members equating to a 36% 

overall team hires rate, compared to 

145 new team members equating to a 

57% overall team hires rate in FY2020, 

the breakdown as shown on page 63.  

Most new team members joined our 

E&amp;C Team in Singapore, China and 

Malaysia, where there are ongoing E&amp;C 

projects.

The team hiring gender balance ratio 

improved 5% year-on-year, with female 

team hires making up 28% of total team 

hires, in a reversal of a downward trend 

since 2018.

3.2.2 Talent Development, 

Management and Retention

As part of our TDP, we embrace 

a holistic talent development, 

management and retention strategy. 

a) Conditions of Employment

We believe in treating our team fairly, 

with respect and an entitlement to 

human rights.  We offer conditions 

of employment and benefits that are 

in line with applicable employment 

laws and regulations, and prevailing 

market practices in countries where we 

operate including:

• 

Reasonable break times, rest days 

and working hours, with overtime

plans.  Salary benchmarking exercises 

are also conducted to ensure that 

remuneration packages are equitable 

with what the sector offers.

There is a profit sharing bonus scheme 

for eligible full-time team members that 

is pegged to a predetermined formula 

based on our overall and respective 

subsidiaries’ financial performance.  

Individual bonus payments and annual 

salary increments are determined after 

each team member’s performance 

appraisal (“appraisal”) is objectively 

assessed by our extended management 

team.

There is also a Boustead Projects 

Restricted Share Plan 2016 (“RSP”) that 

incentivises key team members to work 

towards department and individual key 

performance indicators (“KPIs”) and 

helps to align their interests with our 

long-term success.  Team members 

who are selected to participate under 

the RSP and subsequently meet 

their KPIs for a specific financial year 

may be eligible to receive Boustead 

Projects’ shares, which are typically 

vested and issued in tranches over 

four years.  More information on the 

RSP and earlier restricted share plans 

is available in the Boustead Projects 

Limited FY2021 Annual Report on 

pages 55 to 56, 71 to 75, 119 and 147.

During FY2021, we shared a total of 

S$21.6 million in direct economic 

value with our team, a 9% decrease 

compared to S$23.7 million in FY2020.  

This was partially due to implemented 

reductions in the basic salaries of our 

senior management team, with our 

Executive Directors subject to 10% 

reductions and the rest of our senior 

management team subject to 5.0% 

to 7.5% reductions.  There was also a 

salary freeze for the rest of the team.

c) Performance Appraisal

As part of our TDP, full-time team 

members are appraised at least 

once a year under our Performance 

Management System (“PMS”), with 

the exception of team members who 

are re-employed beyond the statutory 

retirement age, have resigned, are 

serving notice or under probation 

during the relevant appraisal period.  

Team members who are under 

probation will receive a confirmation 

appraisal at their time of confirmation.  

Team members are evaluated on their 

achievement of quantitative department 

and individual KPIs and qualitative 

skillset competencies relevant to their 

respective roles and scope, which are 

defined and set at the beginning of the 

period under review.

Team members who consistently 

outperform are offered opportunities 

to take up higher challenges, while 

team members who underperform 

are assisted in identifying and 

addressing the root causes behind their 

underperformance.   Our PMS allows 

us to identify team members with high 

leadership potential, feeding into our 

Succession Planning System (“SPS”).

Whenever possible, we promote team 

members internally into available 

senior positions.  In addition, our Team 

Recognition Programme includes 

long service awards and specific 

achievement awards given to recognise 

project teams and individual team 

members for excellent achievements 

and performance in specific areas.

During FY2021, 100% of our team 

received appraisals, an overwhelming 

improvement compared to 74% in 

FY2020, the breakdown as shown on 

this page.  There were no differences in 

the percentage of appraisals conducted 

by gender and category.

d) Communication &amp; Engagement

We encourage open communication 

and engagement.  With an open door 

policy, our team members may provide 

feedback or raise concerns with 

direct supervisors and our extended 

management team.  Appraisals 

also provide team members with an 

opportunity to provide and receive 

feedback on their performance and any 

other important matters.

As part of our communication and 

engagement, we strive to organise 

townhall sessions on at least an annual 

basis, serving as an organisation-wide

communication session between our 

extended management team and team 

members.  Townhall sessions are 

typically facilitated by external trainers 

and include team-building activities 

to promote cohesion and teamwork.  

For FY2021, we were unable to hold a 

townhall session due to the pandemic.

We have procedures to address and as 

much as possible, satisfactorily resolve 

team members’ grievances.  This is 

complemented by our whistle-blowing 

mechanism.

During FY2021, we conducted a Team 

Engagement Survey.  Our overall 

response rate was 28%, while the 

more important indicator of overall 

satisfaction rate was 81%.

e)  Career Development &amp; Training 

Opportunities

We have pledged to provide our team 

members with equal opportunity to be 

considered for career development and 

training based on their strengths and 

needs, and to help them to achieve their 

full potential.  We aim to nurture and 

professionally develop team members 

by investing in their career development 

and training, offering them growth 

opportunities through promotions, job 

rotations and overseas assignments.  

Team members can also upgrade 

skillsets and are generally encouraged 

to undergo professional training that 

may help their performance.  This 

includes sponsoring or subsidising the 

cost of approved career development 

and training courses, and may also 

include granting paid leave to attend 

these courses.

We also have an Education Assistance 

Scheme under which we may 

sponsor team members who desire 

to attend job-related courses on 

their own initiative and for personal 

development.  While we identify the 

career development and training needs 

of team members at least once a year 

during appraisals, we also assess such 

needs on an ad-hoc basis.

As we continue to pioneer new 

solutions and make investments 

in procuring and implementing 

transformative technologies, 

methodologies and system enablers, 

we have also made necessary 

investments in training team members 

so that they can realise the full benefits 

of these transformative technologies, 

some of which are shown on this page.

With the pandemic and technological 

advancements accelerating the pace 

of disruption and shortening business 

cycles, we believe that investments in 

training need to be adaptable, flexible 

and timely.

During FY2021, our team underwent a 

total of 356 training hours, compared to 

1,896 hours in FY2020, the breakdown 

as shown on page 66.  This equated 

to an average of 1.3 hours per team 

member in FY2021, a significant 

reduction compared to 7.5 hours per 

team member in FY2020.  There were 

only slight differences in average hours 

by gender and category.

While training was emphasised for 

newer team members in order to 

familiarise them with our transformative 

technologies, methodologies and 

system enablers, the significant 

reduction in average hours per team 

member also coincided with the hiring 

of new team members with greater 

working experience, along with the 

inability to attend traditional face-

to-face training courses during the 

pandemic.

f) Health &amp; Wellness

Other than the conditions of 

employment and benefits mentioned 

earlier, we have also implemented 

team wellness programmes including 

sponsorships and subsidies for 

selected social, sports and recreational 

activities, health screening sessions 

and health talks.  In addition, other 

types of lunchtime talk sessions on 

various topics of interest have been 

organised on a regular basis.

INTRODUCTION

However, events and programmes 

requiring face-to-face interaction were 

mostly suspended during the pandemic.

During FY2021, our team members 

took a total of 445 medical leave days 

due to sickness or hospitalisation, 

compared to 986 days in FY2020, the 

breakdown as shown on this page.  This 

equated to an average of 1.6 days per 

team member in FY2021, a significant 

improvement compared to 3.9 days 

per team member in FY2020.  None 

of this medical leave was in relation to 

workplace safety and health incidents 

or occupational diseases among team 

members at administrative offices and 

project sites.

g) Employment Beyond Statutory 

Retirement Age

We may offer our team members 

re-employment beyond Singapore’s 

statutory retirement age of 62 years, 

as guided by applicable laws and 

regulations, and our policies on 

retirement and re-employment.  Any 

re-employment and extension of 

re-employment depends on whether 

a retiring team member’s service is 

required, the team member is medically 

certified to be fit for employment and 

is able to perform at an acceptable 

level.  In general, we try to provide 

re-employment whenever possible, 

given that retiring team members have 

decades of experience and can still be 

highly productive and motivated.

During FY2021, we had five team 

members or 2% of our total team under 

re-employment beyond the statutory 

retirement age, compared to four team 

members in FY2020, as shown on this 

page.

h) Succession Planning

We recognise that having adequate 

succession planning is a key priority 

and essential to our business continuity.  

We have an SPS for our senior 

management team and key executives.  

Core leadership positions are covered 

by deputies or experienced potential 

replacements, who are identified 

through our PMS as being team 

members with high leadership potential 

to be developed and nurtured into next-

generation leaders.

At the end of FY2021, 100% of our 

senior management team and key 

executive positions (“Key Leaders”) – a 

total of 11 Key Leaders – were covered 

by a named deputy or designated 

successor, which was the same in 

FY2018, FY2019 and FY2020, as shown 

on page 67.  Our Managing Director 

also had at least one named deputy or 

designated successor.  This is in line 

with our perpetual target for 100% 

succession planning coverage for our 

Key Leaders.

i) Termination of Employment &amp; 

Turnover

Our team members are entitled to 

compensation according to severance 

clauses in their employment contracts 

if we terminate their services.  Under 

all circumstances, we seek to ensure 

that any termination of employment is 

conducted in a fair and lawful manner.  

We have also implemented procedures 

to ensure that affected team members 

are properly compensated and may 

also receive job placements or other 

forms of assistance in addition to 

monetary compensation in the event of 

retrenchment.

During FY2021, we had turnover of 

104 team members equating to a 37% 

overall team turnover rate, compared 

to 75 team members equating to a 30% 

overall team turnover rate in FY2020, 

the breakdown as shown on page 68.  

Our monthly team turnover rate was 

3.1%, comparing unfavourably with 

both Singapore’s comparable sectors 

monthly turnover average (1.4%) and 

national average (1.5%) in 2020.5   Due 

to the rapid expansion of our team 

throughout FY2020, there were many 

new team members who had joined 

prior to the onset of the pandemic and 

were unable to cope with the higher 

stress levels caused by the pandemic.  

This was compounded by extreme 

competition for talent in the sector, 

with the loss of some experienced 

team members adding to the higher 

overall turnover rate.  While a certain 

level of natural attrition is healthy and 

encouraged for any organisation, our 

overall turnover rate is acknowledged 

to require significant improvement to 

reach the short-to-medium-term target 

of 25% and long-term target of 20%, in 

order to reach healthy natural attrition 

levels.

3.3 POSITIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT

We are highly committed to creating a 

positive work environment, where we 

are able to safeguard the wellbeing, 

health and safety of our team, clients, 

suppliers and other key stakeholders 

and make them feel comfortable, safe 

and secure within and around our 

operations regionally.  Our positive work 

environment is designed and organised 

to be conducive for delivering our 

solutions in a productive, safe and 

secure manner, and facilitating positive 

interactions with key stakeholders, 

along with meeting applicable laws 

and regulations in countries where we 

operate.

3.3.1 Workplace Health &amp; Safety 

Above All

Of utmost importance, we care deeply 

about safeguarding the wellbeing of 

our team, beginning with our workplace 

safety and health (“WSH”) management

performance and system enablers 

that apply to our team and all key 

stakeholders who are affected by our 

operations.

From a WSH standpoint, the United 

Nations’ International Labour 

Organization (“ILO”) has estimated 

that there are over 2.78 million deaths 

every year due to occupational 

accidents and work-related diseases.  In 

addition, there are 374 million non-fatal 

occupational accidents and work-

related diseases, many which result in 

extended work absences.  The human 

cost of this daily adversity is vast with 

the economic burden of poor WSH 

practices costing an estimated 3.94% of 

GDP each year.6

In Singapore, although the incidence 

of occupational accidents, fatalities 

and diseases are much lower than the 

global average, the local construction 

sector remains a major contributor to 

such incidents, with the sector having 

the highest number of fatalities in 2020.

As part of our WSH Management 

System (“WSHMS”), we first embarked 

on SS506 Part 1:2009 and OHSAS 

18001:2007 certifications in 2006 

and have had a WSHMS in place ever 

since.  In May 2019, our principal E&amp;C 

subsidiary in Singapore, Boustead 

Projects E&amp;C (“BP E&amp;C”), received an 

upgraded certification to the latest ISO 

45001:2018 standard and in April 2021, 

recertified under the standard.

Our WSHMS sets out WSH 

management system enablers, 

commitments, targets and 

responsibilities for our team, with 

overriding responsibility belonging 

to our Environmental, Health and 

Safety (“EHS”) Team headed by our 

Director of EHS, a member of our 

senior management team.  Our EHS 

Team manages all aspects of our 

WSHMS which is both externally 

and internally audited, and ensures 

WSH management performance at all 

workplaces and project sites under our 

control on a daily basis.

We have zero tolerance for accidents 

and are committed to saving 

lives through safe work.  This is 

encapsulated in our safety slogan ‘Safe 

Work, Save Lives’ which has become a 

daily mantra among team members and 

suppliers who undertake work at our 

project sites.  Although we outsource 

construction trades to suppliers and 

do not directly hire any construction 

workers, we take responsibility to 

ensure suppliers’ and the general 

public’s wellbeing, health and safety in 

the communities at project sites.

INTRODUCTION

Through our Total WSH Policy, we are 

committed to:

• 

Preventing injury and ill health 

for our team, workers and key 

stakeholders at our project sites;

• 

Complying with applicable legal 

requirements and with other 

requirements relating to WSH 

hazards;

• 

Creating better wellbeing and 

health for our team, workers and key 

stakeholders at our workplaces;

• 

Providing sufficient and appropriate 

resources to carry out the 

implementation of our WSHMS to 

ensure sustainable WSH standards 

for our team, workers and key 

stakeholders at our project sites; and

• 

Continuous improvement in WSH 

management and performance.

Our WSHMS is supported by 

investments in technologies.  Internally, 

we developed an Integrated Boustead 

Online Safety System (“iBOSS”), 

which provides us with a centralised 

platform to manage all permit-

to-work applications and safety 

induction course bookings.  Through 

digitalisation, iBOSS has replaced time-

consuming administrative processes 

and provides us with data governance, 

traceability and tracking capabilities 

in documenting administrative and 

safety records.  The current iteration of 

iBOSS also includes a biometric facial 

recognition system used to administer 

project site access and security.

Further technologies have been 

implemented due to the pandemic and 

will be shared in more detail under 

the topic of COVID-19 and infectious 

disease outbreaks.

The tone for WSH performance is set at 

the top, where our senior management 

team ‘walks the talk’ when it comes 

to prioritising WSH issues and system 

enablers.  In terms of engagement, 

a monthly safety management 

meeting is conducted with our senior 

management team, EHS Team, all 

WSH professionals and project site 

teams.  Weekly safety management 

meetings are also conducted with our 

EHS Team engaging with respective 

project site safety committees and WSH 

professionals on safety inspections.  

WSH professionals also carry out daily 

project site toolbox talks and safety 

inspections with the safety supervisors 

from all suppliers.

Specific measurable WSH targets 

are set under our WSHMS, which 

are tracked and reviewed at least 

during monthly safety management 

meetings.  While our perpetual WSH 

target is to achieve zero accidents or 

safety incidents at all workplaces and 

project sites, we also set short-term 

WSH targets to address adverse safety 

trends.  Our current short-term WSH 

targets include eliminating incidents of 

personnel or objects falling from height.

3.3.2 Continuous WSH Education &amp; 

Training

Nowhere else do we emphasise 

continuous education and training more 

than in WSH education and training, 

in order to immerse our team and key 

stakeholders in the right WSH culture 

and improve our WSH performance.

Our training programmes include a 

Centralised Safety &amp; Quality Induction 

Training Course conducted for team 

members, suppliers and visitors to our 

project sites and an Enhanced Safety 

Induction Course in partnership with 

external training centres to provide 

safety training in relation to working at 

heights awareness for team members 

and suppliers.

Our EHS Team, WSH professionals 

and project site teams have the 

responsibility of ensuring that suppliers 

conduct appropriate in-house safety 

training for their employees before 

deploying them to our project sites 

and that such training is properly 

documented.  We also have a Safety 

Awareness Promotion Programme that 

gives widespread recognition to the 

efforts of WSH professionals, safety 

supervisors, suppliers and workers in 

achieving WSH milestones.

Continuing our WSH performance 

in FY2021, we had no reportable 

accidents or safety incidents at 

our administrative offices, and zero 

fatalities, high consequence injuries 

and occupational disease incidents 

within our team and suppliers’ 

employees across our operations, 

which was the same in FY2018, FY2019 

and FY2020, as shown on page 70.  

This is in line with our perpetual target 

for zero fatalities, high consequence 

injuries and occupational disease 

incidents.

Our accident frequency rate (“AFR”) 

for our team and suppliers was 1.7 

workplace accidents per million man-

hours, reversing a positive downward 

trend from FY2018 to FY2020.  This was 

mostly due to effects of the pandemic 

and prolonged project closures, which 

restricted manpower at project sites, 

caused additional time pressures to 

accelerate works and subsequently 

resulted in more minor accidents.

Our AFR of 1.7 compared slightly 

unfavourably with both Singapore’s 

comparable sectors AFR average (1.5) 

and national average (1.6) based on 

2018 statistics, the last time that MOM 

reported AFR statistics.7   Since then,

“bizSAFE Journey at a Glance.”  Shine, Singapore Government, Workplace Safety &amp; Health Council, February 2018, page 3.

MOM has changed its reporting of 

workplace accident frequency to align 

with ILO standards.  Calculating the 

accident rate for our team and suppliers 

according to revised MOM standards, 

we registered 1.8 workplace accidents 

per 100,000 workers, comparing 

favourably with Singapore’s comparable 

sectors workplace accident rate 

average (424.1) and national average 

(344.0).8

Our accident severity rate (“ASR”) for 

our team and suppliers was 13 lost 

man-days per million man-hours, in line 

with the stable trend from FY2018 to 

FY2021 and comparing favourably with 

both Singapore’s comparable sectors 

ASR average (118) and national average 

(66) based on 2018 statistics, the last 

time that MOM reported ASR statistics.  

Calculating the lost day rate for our 

team and suppliers according to revised 

MOM standards, we registered 13 

lost man-days to workplace accidents 

per 100,000 workers.  Only one major 

injury was registered and it was not life 

threatening.

3.3.3 bizSAFE Mentorship

In 2008, we initiated our participation 

in Singapore’s Workplace Safety &amp; 

Health Council (“WSHC”) bizSAFE 

Programme by becoming a bizSAFE 

Partner.  In 2009, we achieved the 

bizSAFE Star, the highest qualification 

that can be attained in recognition of 

a corporation’s WSH management 

programmes.

By 2011, we opted to take a national 

leadership role in advocating and 

promoting excellent WSH practices 

in the built environment sector by 

becoming a bizSAFE Mentor; currently 

among only eight bizSAFE Mentors in 

Singapore and the only one among our 

direct competitors.  bizSAFE Mentors 

are corporations that have excellent 

WSH performance and track records, 

and are qualified and invited only by the 

WSHC to take this national leadership 

role to benefit the wider community and 

promote the WSH agenda on various 

sector and national platforms.  As a 

bizSAFE Mentor, we have been one 

of the key contributors in helping the 

bizSAFE Community to expand from 

10,000 corporations in 2011 to over 

35,000 corporations presently.9

As part of our WSH advocacy and 

promotion efforts, and uplifting the 

WSH practices of the built environment 

sector as a whole, we have made it 

compulsory for all of our suppliers to be 

part of the WSHC bizSAFE Programme 

and further encourage them to strive for 

bizSAFE Star, the highest qualification 

achievable.  Continuing these efforts 

in FY2021, 100% of our suppliers are 

certified as at least bizSAFE Level 3, 

while 81% of our suppliers are certified 

as bizSAFE Star, as shown on this page.

Excellent WSH performance is priceless 

when all lives are safeguarded and 

when people everywhere go home 

safely to their families from their 

workplaces every day.

3.3.4 WSH Awards

We are a regular feature at the WSH 

Awards, an annual awards programme 

hosted by the WSHC and MOM to 

recognise excellent WSH performance.

During FY2021 at the WSH Awards 

2020 held in November 2020, we 

received the Safety &amp; Health Award 

Recognition for Projects (“SHARP”) for 

ASM Front-End Manufacturing and 

Wilmar HQ.

INTRODUCTION

To date, our excellent WSH 

performance has been recognised with 

the highest achievements under the 

WSHC bizSAFE Programme and 22 

awards at the WSH Awards, as shown 

on this page.

3.4 SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

We are committed to managing the 

impacts and risks associated with our 

supply chain.  Supplier-related impacts 

and risks are identified, addressed 

and managed under our various 

management systems, Enterprise Risk 

Management Framework, internal 

controls, and external and internal 

audits.

Our procurement includes products and 

services from a network of suppliers 

regionally based on a list of approved 

suppliers for various construction 

equipment services, materials and trade 

services.  Supplier costs and other 

construction costs typically make up 

the bulk of our total cost of sales.

Operationally, we manage our 

procurement through our procurement 

system enablers and list of approved 

suppliers, which are subject to regular 

review as well as external and internal 

audits.

Potential new suppliers are evaluated 

on their reputation, technology 

solutions, financial health, operations, 

quality and EHS performance for 

inclusion on our list of approved 

suppliers.  Existing suppliers are 

regularly evaluated on their upkeep 

of their holistic performance with 

routine engagement and inspections 

throughout projects.  As mentioned 

earlier, all suppliers are required to 

attain at least a bizSAFE Level 3 in 

order to qualify for our list of approved 

suppliers. We also ensure that approved 

suppliers are inducted in our Green &amp; 

Gracious Programme, which is shown 

on pages 79 to 80.

Supplier violations of our holistic 

standards will result in appropriate 

disciplinary actions taken against 

violating suppliers including potential 

permanent removal from our list of 

approved suppliers and referral to 

legal authorities for serious violations 

that may be illegal in nature.  On the 

other hand, suppliers that display 

performance that consistently meets 

our expectations may receive reward 

points that can be used to bolster their 

bids to us on future projects, thereby 

incentivising good performance.

During FY2021, we shared a total of 

S$283.7 million in direct economic 

value with suppliers, a 23% decrease 

year-on-year as compared to S$369.9 

million in FY2020.  This was mainly 

due to slower E&amp;C business segment 

activities as a result of the pandemic.

INTRODUCTION

3.5 COVID-19 &amp; INFECTIOUS 

DISEASE OUTBREAKS

During FY2021, the COVID-19 

pandemic impacted all of our 

operations.

The scale of the disruption caused 

by the pandemic already entails 

long-term implications for the world, 

from the strategies and activities of 

governments, sectors and organisations 

right through to communities and 

individuals, many who may be our key 

stakeholders in countries where we 

operate.  Lessons from the pandemic 

are likely to be applied to the control of 

future infectious disease outbreaks.

In line with this, we acknowledge 

COVID-19 and infectious disease 

outbreaks as a material ESG topic, 

which is directly impacting our business 

and key stakeholders.

We explain how the pandemic has 

impacted our operations, as well as 

the measures we have implemented to 

mitigate the impacts of the pandemic 

on our operations and key stakeholders.

3.5.1 Singapore Government’s 

COVID-19 Circuit Breaker

During FY2021, the Singapore 

Government’s COVID-19 Circuit 

Breaker (“Circuit Breaker”) from 7 

April 2020 to 1 June 2020 saw the 

suspension of all non-essential 

business activities in Singapore – 

including our own – which resulted in 

the closure of our headquarters and 

project sites in Singapore.  Similar 

prolonged lockdowns took place in all 

countries where we operate, resulting 

in the closure of all administrative 

offices regionally for different periods 

of time.  The situation was aggravated 

by the suspension of all construction 

activities at our Singapore project 

sites during the Circuit Breaker, 

followed by further post-Circuit Breaker 

delays due to the phased gradual 

resumption of the built environment 

sector administered by the Building &amp; 

Construction Authority (“BCA”).  This 

resulted in at least four months of delay 

per project, which heavily impacted our 

E&amp;C business segment performance 

for FY2021.  Following the reopening 

of our project sites, further delays to 

projects were due to lower productivity 

to maintain compliance with strict safe 

management measures, especially the 

BCA’s COVID-Safe Restart Criteria, 

along with a serious shortage of foreign 

labour resources – a problem affecting 

Singapore’s entire built environment 

sector due to the high infection levels 

in mass dormitories housing foreign 

workers and a smaller foreign labour 

workforce due to border closures and 

travel restrictions.  We worked closely 

with the BCA and relevant authorities to 

ensure the wellbeing, health and safety 

of all stakeholders as we resumed and 

scaled up operations.

As expected, delays in revenue 

conversion materially lowered our 

E&amp;C business segment performance 

for FY2021, while there were 

unprecedented and elevated levels 

of pandemic-related costs related to 

acceleration, compliance, prolongation 

and resumption.

Notwithstanding the closure of 

our headquarters and project sites 

regionally during the Circuit Breaker 

and other lockdowns occurring 

elsewhere in the world, we were 

able to successfully execute our 

business continuity activities and 

securely conduct business activities 

remotely – except for construction 

activities – through secure Cloud-based 

technology platforms, virtual private 

network (“VPN”) and remote working 

arrangements, enabling continuous 

collaboration not just between team 

members but also with most key 

stakeholders.

3.5.2 Health Safeguards &amp; COVID-19 

Infections

Almost at the immediate onset 

of the pandemic, we had already 

implemented robust health safeguards 

across our administrative offices and 

project sites including compulsory 

health and travel declarations, health 

screening procedures, twice-a-

day temperature monitoring, safe 

distancing of at least one metre 

apart in all workplace settings, 

suspension of all mass activities and 

meetings, and compartmentalisation 

of construction trades at project 

sites.  Following the end of the Circuit 

Breaker, we implemented additional 

health safeguards to further align with 

additional safe management measures 

as mandated by Singapore’s Ministry 

of Health, MOM and BCA.  Our key 

health safeguards which have been 

implemented are shown on page 74.

Despite our robust health safeguards, 

we were not spared from cases 

of COVID-19 infection among our 

suppliers’ employees.  As most of 

our suppliers’ employees resided at 

mass dormitories for foreign workers 

prior to the Circuit Breaker, they were 

placed under Singapore Government-

imposed isolation of mass dormitory 

residents during the Circuit Breaker, 

in a bid to break the transmission of 

COVID-19 among foreign workers due 

to their large-scale communal living 

arrangements.  It was found that as at 

December 2020, COVID-19 infections 

had taken place for as many as 152,794 

mass dormitory residents or 47% of the 

323,000 mass dormitory residents.10

proactively implement strategic 

measures to safeguard the wellbeing, 

health and safety of our stakeholders, 

mitigate the impact of project delays 

and protect the viability and long-

term value of our businesses.  These 

measures are aimed at developing 

resilience and include the execution of 

our business continuity activities, cost 

management measures, supply chain 

management measures and technology 

implementations, as shown on this

Singapore to secure the contract 

from decision-makers in Malaysia and 

the US, even as all three countries 

remained in lockdowns or partial

The Singapore Government’s COVID-19 

business support and relief measures 

have also provided us with much-

needed partial relief, particularly 

through the:

• 

Jobs Support Scheme;

• 

COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) 

Act and its subsequent 

amendments;

• 

Foreign worker levy waivers and 

rebates;

• 

Co-sharing of prolongation costs for 

public sector projects; and

• 

Co-funding of certain safe 

management implementations, 

among other measures.11

In addition, the Singapore Government 

will continue to bear the costs 

of COVID-19 testing for the built 

environment sector until 30 September 

2021.

3.5.6 Future Infectious Disease 

Outbreaks

We will continue to safeguard the 

wellbeing of key stakeholders through 

this pandemic, and adapt to and evolve 

in the ‘new normal’, whatever that 

may be.  Our measures to mitigate the 

impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic 

have been integrated into our business 

continuity activities and operations so 

that these measures can be applied 

to manage future infectious disease 

outbreaks.

PLANET EARTH

For all global stakeholders and all 

known life, Earth is our collective home 

and the only home we know.  Nature in 

all forms – both organic and inorganic – 

is the nurturer and provider of all that is 

necessary to sustain life.  Over the past 

two centuries, the world’s population 

has grown exponentially with one billion 

people1 when the Boustead Group was 

first established in 1828 to 7.8 billion 

people today and an expected 8.5 billion 

people by 2030.2   This has placed 

tremendous resource strains on our 

planet’s natural ecosystem.

Furthermore, close to four billion 

people live in urban centres and this 

is expected to increase to five billion 

people by 2030.  Rapid urbanisation 

will lead to enormous challenges 

in government planning across 

all infrastructure, economic and 

environmental, social and governance 

(“ESG”) facets.

INTRODUCTION

Simultaneously, climate change – 

driven by greenhouse gas emissions 

contributed by human activities 

and agreed upon by 97% of actively 

publishing climate scientists3  – 

continues to result in natural disasters 

and extreme weather events that have 

disrupted national economies and 

hurt lives, people, communities and 

countries.4   Tackling these complex 

issues has been further complicated by 

the COVID-19 pandemic.

Accompanying expected rapid 

urbanisation, demand for construction 

activities and infrastructure will 

continue to grow.  As a trustworthy 

corporate citizen, we plan to do our part 

in minimising our ecological footprint 

and contributing to ESG programmes 

that transit beyond our organisational 

ecosystem to our planet’s natural 

ecosystem.

This section covers our environmental 

stewardship, legal and regulatory 

compliance, and community 

development, which are derived from 

the combined depth of all six capitals 

– financial, manufactured, intellectual, 

human, social and relationship, and 

natural – and ultimately deliver positive 

net effects for all six capitals.

4.1 ENVIRONMENTAL 

STEWARDSHIP

Construction activities and buildings 

exert considerable impact on the 

environment during their multi-decade 

building lifecycles, from the embodied 

energy of materials and construction 

to the operating energy of operations 

and maintenance, and finally demolition 

at the end of the buildings’ useful 

lives.  This also presents significant 

opportunities to mitigate ecological 

footprints of construction activities and 

buildings in general.

As mentioned earlier in Section 2, 

we shared about how our smart eco-

sustainable solutions have the potential 

to directly influence and reduce energy 

loss, emissions, pollution, and energy 

and water consumption in some of 

the most energy-intensive sectors, 

and work towards the extremely 

important planetary goal to combat 

climate change.  Under this part of 

environmental stewardship, we will 

share our processes in environmental 

management.

4.1.1 Environmental Management

We are highly committed to complying 

with all applicable environmental laws 

and regulations in countries where we 

operate.  As part of our Environmental 

Management System (“EMS”) aimed 

at protecting the environment and 

preventing pollution at our operations, 

we first embarked on ISO 14001 

certification in 2006 and have had an 

EMS in place ever since.  In 2018, our 

principal Engineering &amp; Construction 

(“E&amp;C”) subsidiary in Singapore, 

Boustead Projects E&amp;C (“BP E&amp;C”), 

received an upgraded certification to 

the latest ISO 14001:2015 standard 

and in April 2021, recertified under the 

standard.

Our EMS sets out environmental 

management system enablers, 

commitments, targets and 

responsibilities for our team, with 

overriding responsibility belonging to 

our Environmental, Health and Safety 

(“EHS”) Team headed by our Director 

of EHS.  This same team also oversees 

workplace safety and health (“WSH”) 

performance.  Our EHS Team manages 

all aspects of our EMS which is both 

externally and internally audited, and 

ensures environmental management 

performance at all workplaces and 

project sites under our control on a 

daily basis.

We are also committed to raising 

environmental awareness through our 

adoption of green practices.

4.1.2 Green &amp; Gracious Builder 

Scheme

We are a voluntary participant in the 

Building &amp; Construction Authority 

(“BCA”) Green &amp; Gracious Builder 

Scheme (“GGBS”), a programme 

launched to promote environmental 

protection and gracious practices 

during construction activities.

In 2018, for our commendable efforts 

and improvements under the BCA 

GGBS, we received the Green &amp; 

Gracious Builder Award (Excellent) 

for overall excellent environmental, 

professional and sustainability 

practices, an upgrade from the Green &amp; 

Gracious Builder Award (Merit) attained 

in 2015.

committed to fulfilling our responsibility 

to the environment and the general 

public in terms of addressing 

environmental concerns and mitigating 

potential inconveniences to the general 

public in construction activities.  Our 

Green &amp; Gracious Programme (“GGP”) 

is a subset of our EMS and sets out how 

we should fulfil our role as a Green &amp; 

Gracious Builder. 

Under the BCA GGBS and our GGP, 

we periodically review and update 

construction processes and key 

performance indicators on ESG topics 

such as those shown on this page.  

Increasingly, there are overlaps in 

ESG topics, with fulfilment in one area 

contributing to benefits in other areas.

Our GGP includes monitoring, 

performing and improving on internally 

set targets that cover areas such 

as reductions in concrete and re-

bar wastage, waste disposal, direct 

energy and water consumption from 

construction operations, effluents, dust, 

noise and vibrations.  Our targets are 

set at realistically achievable levels that 

are significantly better than Singapore’s 

construction sector and national 

averages in these same topics, in which 

it was found that the construction 

sector contributed to about 14% of 

all waste generated in Singapore in 

2020, a significant reduction from 

about 20% in 2019.  However, this 

was due to prolonged closure of the 

sector because of the pandemic and 

not as a result of an improvement 

in the sector’s waste management 

practices.  Although eventually 99% 

of construction waste generated and 

52% of Singapore’s waste generated 

were recycled,5 it is more important 

to reduce waste generation before 

the recycling phase since resources 

– albeit a lower quantum – are still 

required for recycling activities. We 

also require potential new fabricators, 

subcontractors and suppliers (together 

“suppliers”) to be evaluated on their 

reputation, technology solutions, 

financial health, operations, quality and 

EHS performance for inclusion on our 

list of approved suppliers, thereafter 

being inducted in our GGP.

Due care is taken to ensure that 

businesses, residents and visitors 

within communities neighbouring our 

project sites are communicated to and 

not unnecessarily inconvenienced by 

ongoing projects.  These efforts include 

keeping our project sites clean and 

organised, protecting pathways and 

sidewalks that run along project sites, 

minimising dust, noise and vibrations, 

and putting up communications and 

signages where appropriate, including

INTRODUCTION

4.1.3 Energy &amp; Water Usage 

Efficiency

We have worked hard to improve the 

energy and water usage efficiency of 

our operations in order to optimise the 

use of natural resources and mitigate 

our ecological footprint.  Improving 

energy and water usage efficiency has 

also translated to lower operating costs 

and conversely higher profitability.  

Such gains have been achieved in two 

areas of our operations: during the 

construction phase of E&amp;C projects 

and during the operational phase of 

multi-tenanted properties that we have 

developed and continue to own and 

lease out.

It should be noted that in 2020, 

Singapore’s annual mean temperature 

was measured as 28°C, which was 0.5°C 

higher than the 1981 to 2010 long-term 

average and the eighth warmest year 

on record; while annual total rainfall 

was measured as being 13% below the 

long-term average and the eighth driest 

year in the past 30 years.6  This would 

have affected our rainwater collection 

and recycling points at E&amp;C project 

sites and rainwater harvesting systems 

used for landscape irrigation and toilet 

flushing at leasehold properties, where 

collecting less rainwater for recycling 

results in more water being drawn from 

the national water network.

a) Energy &amp; Water Usage Intensity of 

E&amp;C Projects

Our E&amp;C projects use diesel as a fuel 

for onsite diesel power generators, 

electricity drawn from the national 

power grid and water drawn from the 

national water network.  We also collect 

rainwater which is treated and recycled 

for use in activities such as project site 

cleanliness and washing of vehicles 

leaving project sites.

We continue to measure our average 

energy usage intensity (“EUI”) and 

water usage intensity (“WUI”) per 

square metre (“m2”) of constructed 

gross floor area (“GFA”) – not including 

recycled water – for all significant E&amp;C 

projects regionally, as shown pages 82 

to 83.

During FY2021, average EUI and WUI 

per m2 of constructed GFA deteriorated 

year-on-year compared to FY2020, 

although this was partly due to the 

timing of E&amp;C projects in various 

phases.  It is recommended that the 

four-year average is used for a more 

accurate gauge of this measure.

b) Energy &amp; Water Usage Intensity of 

Administrative Offices

Our administrative offices regionally 

use electricity drawn from the national 

power grid and water drawn from the 

national water network.  In addition, 

some administrative offices have the 

benefit of being located at our multi-

tenanted properties that also use 

electricity generated by solar power.

We actively track the electricity 

and water consumption at most 

administrative offices regionally to 

provide a baseline for comparison 

against our future usage, as shown on 

page 84.

During FY2021, our average EUI was 

446.4 kWh per team member per year 

at administrative offices, improving 

year-on-year compared to 489.4 kWh 

in FY2020, and continuing a positive 

downward trend from FY2018 to 

FY2021.  This was mainly due to 

remote working arrangements for 

all team members for at least part 

of the year, partially offset by more 

office space allocated per team 

member in FY2021 due to an office 

expansion that took place just before 

the pandemic.  Our average WUI was 

16.1 m3 per team member per year at 

administrative offices, deteriorating 

year-on-year compared to 9.2 m3 in 

FY2020.  However, this was due to a 

distortion of the average WUI in FY2021 

because our headquarters, Edward 

Boustead Centre had a water metre 

issue and underground pipe leakage 

in 2020, resulting in more water being 

temporarily drawn from the national 

water network.

c) Energy &amp; Water Usage Intensity of 

Multi-Tenanted Properties

Our leasehold properties use electricity 

drawn from the national power grid, 

electricity generated by solar power and 

water drawn from the national water 

network.

We actively track the electricity 

consumption at our multi-tenanted 

properties in Singapore constructed 

after the launch of mandatory 

submission under the BCA Green Mark 

Certification Scheme in 2008, to provide 

a baseline for comparison against our 

future usage, as shown on page 86.

Presently, Edward Boustead Centre and 

ALICE@Mediapolis (“ALICE”) are the 

only two properties under this category 

that were fully operational for the whole 

of FY2021.  We do not track the EUI 

and WUI at other properties within our 

leasehold portfolio as they are mainly 

single-tenanted properties and hence, 

energy and water consumption are 

driven by tenants’ processes, which can 

significantly differ based on respective 

tenants’ business activities.

constructed floor area used greener 

building methodologies including 

prefabricated building systems 

and prefabricated bathroom units 

(“PBUs”), the first large-scale PBUs in 

the built environment sector.  ALICE 

also accesses district cooling to gain 

greater efficiencies and has several sky 

terraces to reduce heat island effects, 

which together with the green features 

mentioned earlier, have been estimated 

to result in CO2 emissions savings of 

842 tonnes annually, equivalent to 

removing the emissions of 179 cars for 

a year.

Where available, we will use chilled 

water sourced from district cooling 

plant networks for our properties, which 

provides significantly greater energy

and water usage efficiency and reduces 

emissions, compared to installing 

standalone chiller plant systems located 

within our properties.  In addition, we 

tap on NEWater – ultraclean, high-grade 

reclaimed water – whenever possible.

The EUI of Edward Boustead Centre 

and ALICE were 114.3 kWh and 187.0 

kWh respectively per m2 of GFA per 

year, which continued to compare 

favourably with both Singapore’s 

comparable buildings EUI average 

(222 and 212 respectively) and national 

average (247), with Edward Boustead 

Centre in the top performing quartile 

for comparable buildings, while ALICE 

just missed the second best performing 

quartile, falling into the top-end of 

the third best performing quartile for 

comparable buildings, as shown on 

page 86.7  While the EUI for Edward 

Boustead Centre was in line with our 

short-to-medium-term target of being 

in at least the second best performing 

quartile of comparable buildings EUI, 

ALICE fell slightly short of the target.

The WUI of Edward Boustead Centre 

was 2.6 m3 per m2 of GFA per year, 

which compared unfavourably with 

Singapore’s comparable buildings 

median WUI (1.0).  This was due to a 

water metre issue and underground 

pipe leakage in 2020, which resulted 

in more water being temporarily drawn 

from the national water network.  The 

issues were subsequently rectified by 

PUB.  The WUI of ALICE was 0.4 m3 per 

m2 of GFA per year, which compared 

favourably with Singapore’s comparable 

buildings median WUI.8  While the WUI 

for ALICE was in line with the short-to-

medium-term target of being lower than 

the comparable buildings median WUI, 

Edward Boustead Centre fell short of 

the target.

It should be noted that ALICE has yet 

to reach full asset stabilisation, hence 

the EUI and WUI for ALICE in FY2021 

may not be an accurate gauge of future 

performance.

4.1.4 Waste Reduction

Under environmental stewardship, we 

believe that waste reduction should be 

undertaken in both big and small ways.  

We encourage our team to reduce 

paper usage and to reuse or recycle 

non-sensitive paper waste where 

practicable.

In 2015, building on our green initiative, 

we adopted a paperless electronic 

format for annual reports and in 2018, 

further phased out CD copies of annual 

reports altogether to reduce plastic 

waste as well.  This report is also 

available in electronic format only.

We have also digitised most of our 

previously hard copy-based records 

where appropriate and continue to 

use secure Cloud-based technology 

platforms and software solutions to 

improve our data governance and 

productivity, which helps to reduce yet 

another form of waste – time waste.

In fact, our investments in integrated 

digital delivery and building information 

modelling (“BIM”) have significantly 

improved digitalisation, productivity 

and eliminated large amounts of paper 

usage, while drastically reducing 

potential human errors in projects 

where BIM is applied.

Our earlier investments in technological 

transformation allowed us to execute 

our business continuity activities 

immediately at the onset of the 

pandemic, ensuring reasonable 

productivity, other than for construction 

activities, even under full remote 

working arrangements.

4.1.5 Strategic Technology 

Partnership for Environmental 

Sustainability

In 2020, we signed a framework 

agreement with Sunseap – the largest 

and most established integrated 

clean energy solutions company in 

Singapore – for the potential installation 

of rooftop industrial solar energy 

systems at our real estate projects and 

potential provision of lower-cost clean 

energy solutions to our clients and 

tenants.  This partnership aims to better 

utilise rooftop space – an important 

asset within our leasehold portfolio.  

Promoting eco-sustainability through 

greater use of renewable energy aligns 

with our position as the market-leading 

builder and developer of smart, eco-

sustainable and future-ready business 

park and industrial developments.

Our partnership with Sunseap 

encourages our tenants to install 

rooftop industrial solar energy systems 

on top of our properties, should tenants 

find that direct solar power generation 

can benefit their operations located at 

our properties.  Tenants do not have to 

fund capital and operating expenditures 

for these rooftop industrial solar 

energy systems, instead purchasing 

the generated solar power from 

Sunseap at commercially agreed tariff 

rates.  For tenants who wish to offset 

their greenhouse gas emissions and 

attain their energy and environmental 

sustainability goals, Sunseap also offers 

renewable energy certificates, which 

are tradeable green energy attributes 

that represent units of electricity 

generated from renewable energy 

generation facilities.

INTRODUCTION

During FY2021, we initiated 

introductions of Sunseap to tenants 

within our leasehold portfolio, with 

at least two major tenants of single-

tenanted properties advancing in 

negotiations with Sunseap to install 

rooftop industrial solar energy systems 

at our properties and commit to 

powering operations with clean energy.

4.2 LEGAL &amp; REGULATORY 

COMPLIANCE

We are highly committed to fully 

complying with applicable laws 

and regulations in countries where 

we operate.  Often, these laws and 

regulations cross the boundaries of 

economic and ESG topics, covering 

almost all aspects of our business 

and are governed under the scope 

of different government ministries, 

agencies and regulators.

In Singapore, the main government 

stakeholders and regulators that we 

regularly communicate with are shown 

on page 88.  In other countries where 

we operate, we regularly communicate 

with government stakeholders and 

regulators that are similar in scope.

Government stakeholders and 

regulators give us our business 

licences to conduct our operations.  Full 

compliance with applicable laws and 

regulations cannot be overstated and is 

inherent in all system enablers.

Relevant on-the-job training is 

provided to team members to ensure 

that they comprehend and meet the 

requirements of laws and regulations 

that apply to their job scopes.  In 

addition, professional training may also 

be extended to specific team members 

in order for them to better comprehend 

and meet the requirements of 

applicable laws and regulations in high-

risk economic and ESG topics.  Other 

than government stakeholders and 

regulators, we may at times also have 

to comply with laws and regulations 

embedded within contractual terms 

set by clients and lenders, who have 

to ensure compliance with laws and 

regulations which are specific to their 

countries and sectors.

During FY2021, we had one minor fine 

(defined as being between S$1,001 to 

S$10,000) in an environmental area, 

a significant improvement compared 

to four minor fines in environmental 

areas in FY2020.  We also had zero 

major fines or cases brought against us 

through dispute resolution mechanisms 

by government stakeholders and 

regulators in economic and ESG facets, 

and zero substantiated complaints 

received from external parties and 

regulators or identified leaks, thefts 

or losses of customer data under the 

customer privacy area, as shown on this 

page.  Our supplier paid the minor fine,

noise at a project site.  This is in line 

with our perpetual targets to have no 

more than one minor fine per year 

and zero major fines, sanctions, cases 

brought against us through dispute 

resolution mechanisms and complaints 

concerning breaches of customer 

privacy.

Going forward, we expect legal and 

regulatory compliance related to 

COVID-19 and infectious diseases, 

and transformative technologies – 

given their cybersecurity risks and 

disruptive nature – to become much 

more prevalent, with governments, 

sectors, organisations, communities 

and individuals being deeply impacted 

in all facets of life, covering general 

wellbeing and health to economic and 

ESG facets.  Governments will be keen 

to enforce new legal and regulatory 

compliance to pre-empt and protect the 

world from the pandemic and future 

infectious diseases, along with ensuring 

that transformative technologies do 

not encroach on individual privacy 

and rights or pose threats to national 

security, economic stability and market 

governance.

4.3 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT

We are committed to community 

development and selecting an 

appropriate externally-managed 

community development programme to 

support on a long-term basis.

At times, we also undertake 

philanthropic fund raising through 

our own fund raising platforms in 

collaboration with our suppliers.  

Communities in countries where 

we operate directly benefit from our 

monetary and in-kind donations to 

organisations that run community 

development programmes.  They 

also indirectly benefit through the 

projects that we undertake for end-user 

clients, which provide jobs to those 

communities and ESG benefits.

Our efforts are centred on 

meaningfully deploying a portion 

of our organisational resources to 

support local communities and ESG 

programmes.

In 2018, we formally inaugurated 

our ‘Boustead Cares’ Community 

Partnership Programme with 

Singapore’s North East Community 

Development Council (“NECDC”) and 

helped raise S$50,000 in support of 

NECDC’s community activities, with 

our first year of contributions going 

towards NECDC’s Community Give 

Back Month, when volunteers from our 

team worked with staff from NECDC 

and Bizlink Centre to organise a trip to 

the Singapore Zoo for Bizlink Centre’s 

beneficiaries, primarily disadvantaged 

and disabled individuals.

In 2019, we continued our ‘Boustead 

Cares’ Community Partnership 

Programme with NECDC through fund 

raising activities in conjunction with our 

annual Boustead Projects Lunar 7th 

Month Charity Dinner, where we raised 

over S$161,000.

Part of the funds raised through our 

annual charity dinner were committed 

to several NECDC community 

development programmes including 

the sponsorship of critical renovation 

works for Kheng Chiu Loke Tin Kee 

Home (“Kheng Chiu Happy Lodge”), a 

registered charity in Singapore.  The 

renovation works comprised elder-

friendly improvements including the 

installation of anti-slip treatment to 

toilet entrances, grab bars in toilet 

cubicles and anti-slip tiles in washing 

areas.  In April 2019, volunteers from 

our team visited Kheng Chiu Happy 

Lodge to engage with and entertain 

residents during the ceremonial 

completion of the renovation works in 

an occasion that was also graced by 

NECDC’s Mayor, Mr Desmond Choo.

Separately in another event in 

September 2019, volunteers from our 

team worked with staff from NECDC 

to organise a trip to Turf City’s Red 

Dynasty Paintball Park for marginalised 

teens to have an enjoyable and 

meaningful day out.

During FY2021, we shared a total of 

S$10,000 in direct economic value 

towards community investments, with 

the sharp decrease in activities related 

to our ‘Boustead Cares’ Community 

Partnership Programme due to the 

pandemic, which restricted face-to-face 

community interaction that is core to 

the programme.  However, under the 

programme, our ongoing collaboration 

with the Singapore Association for 

Mental Health (“SAMH”), through 

NECDC, progressed on a project named 

‘Building Connections through Art’, with 

a total of S$37,500 in previously raised 

funds from FY2020 being committed 

towards the artistic practice of SAMH’s 

beneficiaries under this project.

In addition, in February 2021, keeping 

to a safe-distanced event, volunteers 

from our team shopped for, packed 

and distributed bags of groceries and 

shopping vouchers for 60 beneficiary 

families.

Moving forward, we intend to 

reinvigorate activities under our 

‘Boustead Cares’ Community 

Partnership Programme and annual 

Boustead Projects Lunar 7th Month 

Charity Dinner, once face-to-face 

interaction is deemed as safe for all key 

stakeholders.

4.4 CONCLUSION

Although we have achieved respectable 

performance in material ESG topics, 

we recognise that we can and must 

do better.  Having collected and 

reported on at least four years’ worth 

of data on material ESG topics, we are 

progressively setting targets in material 

ESG topics where feasible to do so, 

with most ESG topics having short-

to-medium-term, long-term and/or 

perpetual targets.

This past year, the Boustead Group 

unveiled their refreshed global icon, 

revitalising their face to the world.  

Together with the Boustead Group, we 

revitalised our brand identity, brand 

image and digital assets, which are 

now harmonised with our regional 

presence, continued cultivation of 

enduring relationships, progressive 

reputation and long-term investments 

in people and technologies, with a 

focus on creating sustainable shared 

socio-economic value.  Our refreshed 

icon also continues to embody the 

Boustead Way, the Boustead Group’s 

unique brand of entrepreneurialism that 

has also guided the Boustead Projects 

Team for 25 years, helping us to reach 

our Silver Jubilee.

Hand-in-hand with our stakeholders, 

we intend to continue our role as a 

trustworthy corporate citizen, one 

which we hope to honour for many 

more decades to come.  Join us in this 

ultramarathon, run the Boustead Way.

The Boustead Projects Limited 

FY2021 Longevity Report would not 

be possible without the efforts of our 

team who has worked extremely hard 

over the past 25 years and continues to 

emulate the efforts of tens of thousands 

of Boustead Men and Women who 

strived to deliver sustainable shared 

socio-economic value and progress 

to multiple generations of key 

stakeholders and make a positive 

impact economically, environmentally 

and socially on the world over almost 

two centuries.  We continue to live out 

the Boustead Way, together with our 

mission and vision for key stakeholders 

and in memory of the Boustead Group’s 

founder, Mr Edward Boustead and our 

fellow team members who have passed 

on the baton.  We are grateful to our 

former team members who ran this 

ultramarathon before us and are equally 

grateful to our current team members 

who chose to pick up the baton to 

continue running this ultramarathon 

today.
