SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

01
























































































In this AF Global Limited’s Sustainability Report, we have presented an update on our sustainability efforts for the 

financial year ended 31 December 2020 (‘’FY2020”).

The Board had reviewed and determined that the material Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) issues 

identified remained relevant and significant to our organisation and key stakeholders. In FY2020, the Board 

continued to oversee the management and monitoring of these ESG factors as part of its overall responsibility of 

directing and leading the organisation towards our mission of value creation and building a sustainable business. 

In view of the global and far-reaching impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, significant measures were taken at each 

of our assets, topmost being the safety and security of our employees and guests. Protective apparatus, rigorous 

disinfection, safe distancing were introduced at each of our assets in line with respective government guidelines. 

Headcount and manning were restructured and reorganised operationally, whilst prioritising the welfare of our 

employees, guests and the maintenance of the assets. These measures will be reviewed and adapted as the 

pandemic situation evolves to ensure our assets remain sustainable and would emerge in a stronger position.

3. CORPORATE PROFILE


Corporate Social Responsibility is a key driver towards long-term sustainability which is pragmatically integrated 

into our business practices and our corporate culture.

Being in the hospitality business, we are in a privileged position to raise awareness on the importance of 

sustainability and allow our guests to participate in some of the sustainability initiatives during their stay with us 

in our hotel. We have engaged global professional hotel management companies reputed for their experience 

and approach toward sustainability so as to tap into their valuable knowledge to help us in implementing and 

integrating sustainability in our daily business practices and operational activities. We aim to create a culture 

of sustainability among our staff in every aspect of our hotel operations, a culture which allows us to imprint 

positive influence on our guests through their experience with us.

4.1 Sustainability Management  

Framework

In July 2017, we established our sustainability reporting 

framework. We performed an analysis on our business 

and operation models to establish the basis for our 

stakeholder mapping and materiality assessment. 

Through our analysis, we identified five key stakeholder 

groups within our sustainability context and their 

respective material issues are shown in this report.

4.2 Key Stakeholders and Material Issues

We have a review, assessment and feedback process 

in relation to ESG topics. The key to this is a risk 

assessment exercise which entails the identification, 

assessment and documentation of material risks and 

corresponding internal controls. Such material risks 

include fraud and corruption, environmental, health 

and safety, and human capital risks. We review the 

adequacy and effectiveness of our risk assessment 

process in response to changing business and 

operation environment.

We also identify and review material issues that are most 

relevant and significant to us and our stakeholders. 

Priority is given to issues important to society that is 

applicable to us. We then prioritise our sustainability 

efforts and report issues that are most material to our 

business and stakeholders.

Material Issues

Significance

Environment and 

Future Generation

• Climate change

• Natural disaster

• Urbanisation, pollution etc.

Our core business is in the area of hospitality. 

Our hotel provides comfortable and conducive 

accommodation to our guests. Climate change 

such as monsoon seasons and pollution directly 

affect the holiday or business-related experience 

of our guests.

Our sustainability agenda for the environment 

and future generation has evolved over many 

years and is vital to our business operations as 

well as being instilled into the day-to-day work 

practices of all our staff. Our measures focus on 

the key goals of reduction of energy and water 

consumption, reduction of carbon footprint, and 

raising staff awareness on sustainable issues.

Employee

• Employee skill set

• Employee equal opportunity 

based on merit

• Non-discrimination

• Code of conduct

• Human rights

Our employees want to work in a company that 

is ethical and empathetic, where they will be 

motivated and empowered to meet their full 

potential, both professionally and personally.

Through mutual respect and equal opportunities 

based on merit, we develop a culture of goodwill 

and motivation with the employees. Such culture 

will translate into hospitality towards our hotel 

guests.

Customer

• Customer health and safety

• Terrorism

• Consumer trends

The safety and security of guests are of paramount 

importance, particularly as the hotel is located in 

a tourist destination (i.e. Phuket) with incidents 

of theft and rowdy tourists’ behaviour. Fire, life 

and safety related standards are strictly adhered 

to, in compliance with legal regulations. Such 

measures instill guest confidence in the hotel and 

the brand.

Our service and product are continuously 

upgraded in line with consumer trends, allowing 

the hotel to be competitive in the market.

Supplier

• Sustainable and quality supplies

• Ethical practice of suppliers

Working closely with suppliers and channel 

partners would boost competitiveness and 

encourage sharing of sustainable practices.

Community

• Preserving culture and heritage 

of the local community

• Goodwill with local community

Our hotel maintains good relationships with our 

neighbours in the city and area where it is located. 

Neighbours are engaged on a regular basis.

Management team members are involved in local 

associations which promote various community 

causes. Such measures help to build the hotel’s 

reputation in the local community.

Common to all 

Stakeholder Groups

• Compliance with prevailing laws 

and regulations.

We believe that good CSR practice goes hand-in-hand with good corporate management practice. We also 

recognise that it is vital that our management approaches are adaptable to the dynamics of business and operation 

environment across geographic boundaries in such a way that we can continuously assess our impacts, develop 

sustainability objectives and respond in a proper manner to meet expectations.

Communication and provision of appropriate feedback mechanisms which will allow us to monitor and evaluate 

performance as well as explore new possibilities is critical in sustainability reporting. This is managed through a 

CSR plan.

Response to COVID-19 pandemic

As the pandemic situation continues to evolve around 

the world, the safety and well-being of our guests and 

team members are our top priority. We have set up 

rigorous and enhanced cleanliness practices at all our 

premises to ensure that our guests can experience 

an elevated level of protection. As of the date of the 

publication of this report, over 92% of the hotel staff 

have received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.

The hotel had been certified under the Amazing 

Thailand Safety and Health Administration program, 

launched by the Tourism Authority of Thailand in 

collaboration with public and private sector partners.

The IHG Way of Clean program was launched in

5.1 Protecting Our Environment for Future 

Generations

5.1.1 Our Approach

We continuously seek new and innovative ways to 

reduce the environmental impact of our products and 

services while maintaining the quality. We recognise 

our responsibility to protect the environment for the 

health and well-being of future generations.

5.1.2 Reduction of Carbon Footprint

We recognise that the effective management and 

monitoring of carbon footprint can reduce operating 

costs, raise brand profile, create a competitive edge 

and increase stakeholder value. Our carbon footprint is 

measured in terms of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission. 

However, GHG emission is an absolute measure of 

how much carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) is emitted. 

Our GHG emission is predominantly indirect (Scope 2) 

emission. We have direct (Scope 1) emissions and we 

do not include the GHG emissions generated by our 

suppliers (Scope 3).

Considering the changes and dynamics of business 

and operations, we established our GHG emission 

efficiency index for consistent tracking of carbon 

footprint over time. To this end, we have set a target 

for GHG emission efficiency improvement of 10% from 

our 2017 level by 2030.

In FY2020, our GHG emission efficiency index stands 

at 231,353.39 kgCO2e per SGD million, which is 32.6%  

higher than our base year 2017. This is due to low 

revenue from the temporary hotel closure amid the 

COVID-19 pandemic as travel restrictions were imposed 

on international arrivals. Domestic travellers were 

cautious and occupancies remained low after the hotel 

re-opened. Although electricity consumption (in kWh) 

was 67% lower than year 2019, the low revenue due 

to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic had resulted 

in a higher GHG emission efficiency index. As a result, 

the index may not be comparable to prior years with 

normalised business activities. We will continue to 

monitor our performance and work towards our 2030 

goal.

5.1.3 Reduction of Paper Consumption

Our employees are urged to minimise paper wastage 

at work by adhering to our internal guidelines. For 

example, double-sided printing is set as a default, 

lower grammage paper is used for daily printing, and 

blank sides of unneeded single-sided copies are used 

for printing drafts. A green message to consider the 

environment before printing is always included in the 

email signatures of our employees. Paper re-use and 

recycling habits are also cultivated through initiatives 

such as our in-house reminders posted near the copy 

machines.

We have implemented a digital document management 

system with an aim to improve operational efficiency, 

security and reduce paper consumption. We hope to 

eventually evolve into a paperless working environment.

Considering the changes and dynamics of business 

and operations, we established our paper consumption 

index for consistent tracking of paper consumption 

over time. To this end, we have set a target for a 

reduction in paper consumption of 10% from our 2017 

level by 2030.

In FY2020, we consumed a total of 2,020.85 kg of 

paper, 100% of which are Forest Stewardship Council 

(FSC) certified. The paper consumption index stands at 

298.13 kg per SGD million which is 33.6% higher than 

our base year 2017. We reduced paper consumption by 

63% this year with the digitalisation of certain processes 

but the low revenue as explained in section 5.1.2 above 

resulted in a higher index. We will continue to monitor 

our paper consumption and work towards our 2030 goal.

5.1.4 Promoting Green Practices

Our hotel has been implementing green solutions 

suitable for its operating environment. Green solutions 

are initiatives that the hotel can implement to 

progressively improve its operation practices toward 

its sustainability goals. Each green solution lays out the 

steps that the hotel must take to implement the solution. 

Such initiatives are to be implemented through areas 

such as design, operational procedures and adaptation 

of green technologies to achieve objectives such as 

reducing energy, water and waste, cutting carbon 

emissions, improving guest health and comfort as well 

as reducing operating and maintenance costs.

Examples of green solutions range from using 

energy-efficient 

lighting 

and 

lighting 

controls, 

installing water-efficient bathroom fixtures to using 

energy efficient appliances or any other alternative 

energy sourcing.

5.1.5 Hotel Sustainability Initiatives

Our hotel proactively track sustainability indicators as 

a core part of our hotel management practices. Some 

key indicators are shown in section 6.3.

AF GLOBAL  

5. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT


5.2  Caring for Our Employees

5.2.1 Our Approach

Our people are our valuable resource and investing in 

their professional development is vital to our business 

sustainability. Our goal is to establish work ethics 

among our employees, which are in line with our core 

values and code of conduct.

We recognise that a motivated workforce will convey 

a positive message to all our key stakeholders. By 

attracting, nurturing, empowering and rewarding our 

employees, we create an environment conducive 

for innovation and inspiration which will boost our 

competitiveness.

Our business operates in an environment with diverse 

races, cultures and geographic locations. With this 

in mind, our Human Resource (HR) polices take into 

consideration the prevailing laws and regulations as 

well as local culture, norms and sensitivity.

5.2.2 Employment Practices

Our HR management principles and policies have been 

developed and established based on fair employment 

practices with the goal of attracting, developing and 

retaining a robust and motivated workforce. Our HR 

policies cover key areas such as remuneration, benefits, 

and training. Our performance-based reward scheme 

provides guidance and motivation to our employees 

to perform to their potential in alignment with the 

objectives of the Group.

5.2.2.1 Communication

As we grow, effective and regular communication 

across the organisation is crucial to ensure continuous 

alignment of objectives between the employees 

and the organisation. We achieve this through our 

various communication sessions customised based 

on the target employees. Communication sessions 

for our managers are held on a regular basis. The 

agendas covered at these sessions are customised 

as appropriate to the target functional scope of the 

managers.

5.2.2.2 Employee Feedback

We value our employees’ expertise in their areas of 

responsibilities. Therefore, their feedback is important 

in the improvement of overall management and 

operations of the organisation. Through various 

established processes of employee engagement, such 

as employee objective setting, performance review 

as well as exit interviews in events of resignations, 

we 

gather 

valuable 

feedbacks 

for 

continuous 

improvements to the organisation.

In addition, there are other feedback channels for 

areas specific to business and function, such as the 

whistle-blowing policy on control and compliance 

issues. This policy allows staff to raise their concerns 

in confidence about possible improprieties in matters 

of financial reporting or other matters. We also accept 

anonymous reports to ensure that independent 

investigations of such matters are carried out and that 

appropriate follow-up action is taken.

5.2.2.3 Career Development and Training

We recognise that education and training is essential 

in maintaining a competitive workforce. Employee 

career development and performance management 

are established based on merit and contribution.

Training programmes cover a variety of areas catering 

for employees with different job scopes and skills 

requirements. The contents are guided by industry 

standards. In addition, specific training are provided 

based on the specific requirements of the businesses 

and functions. Training topics range from soft skills 

such as communication and hospitality to technical 

programmes covering safety and office productivity 

tools.

In FY2020, each employee received an average 

of 8.6 hours of training. We recognised that the 

training requirements vary depending on the levels of 

management responsibilities. However, with the hotel’s 

low occupancy during the pandemic, non-managerial 

staff received more training instead so as to upskill and 

retain the existing employees. Senior management 

registered an average of 1.9 hours of training per 

person while managerial and non-managerial staff 

received an average of 3.9 hours and 9.4 hours of 

training respectively. We will continue to monitor our 

performance and work towards our 2030 goal.

In addition to the human resources we manage, we 

also engage external contracted companies as our 

outsourced vendors to provide personnel, who might 

work within our premises. Although we supervise 

these individuals, they are employed by contracted 

companies and are not included in our head count. We 

do not employ other types of un-contracted workers.

We expect that the contracted companies we work 

with will share our core principles of HR management 

practices. In the event that this expectation is 

compromised, we will evaluate if we will continue to 

engage them.

5.2.4 Employee Benefits

To ensure our workforce is well taken-care off, our 

employees are provided with statutory benefits as well 

as market-competitive non-statutory benefits.

5.2.4.1 Retirement and Healthcare

Our Group has presence overseas where there are 

local laws and regulations on pension and healthcare 

for employees. Our HR management practices comply 

with these applicable laws and regulations.

5.2.5 Safety and Health in the Workplace

We are committed to workplace safety and health 

and take precautions to prevent occupational 

injuries among employees. We believe that safe work 

conditions will boost morale.

5.2.6 Individual Rights

Protecting basic human rights is fundamental to 

all our operations. Labour rights, the prohibition of 

discrimination and harassment, protection of privacy, 

prohibition of forced and child labour, and workplace 

health and safety are observed within the work 

environment. Discrimination and harassment are not 

tolerated.

We also respect our employees’ rights to freedom of 

association as well as their membership with trade 

unions and other professional bodies.

In FY2020, no incidents of forced labour, child 

labour or young workers were identified across the 

organisation, and no human rights-related grievances 

have been reported.

5.3 

Focusing on Our Customers’ Needs

5.3.1 

Our Approach

Safety within our hotel premises have always been our 

key priority.

Open and frequent communication and responsive 

feedback are ingrained into our daily activities with 

customer interaction. In addition to striving for 

excellence in our product, service and support, we 

attach importance to data privacy. We have processes 

and controls in place over confidential and sensitive 

data related to our customers.

5.3.2 

Health and Safety

Providing an accommodating atmosphere that does 

not compromise safety is the biggest challenge 

that hotels face. Achieving these goals require a 

multifaceted plan that starts with staff training and 

guest education about safety and security issues. Our 

hotel management consistently enforce established 

security policies, such as allowing only registered 

guests on hotel property. Constant planning to stay 

ahead of these issues is also a must, especially when 

the hotel hosts public events.

5.3.2.1 Access Control

Controlling access is an important part of hotel 

security planning to prevent criminal activities such 

as theft from guest rooms. Our contractors and staff 

are trained in controlling room key distribution and 

restricting access to registered guests only. Security 

personnel are stationed at all main access points to 

greet people, while deterring anyone with no business 

from entering the property, especially disruptive or 

intoxicated non-guests.

5.3.2.2 Guests Education

Hotel employees have a responsibility to educate 

guests on safety and security responsibilities. The 

challenge for staff is to get the message across without 

negatively affecting the customer’s experience. For 

instance, the bellman can gently remind guests the 

importance of locking room doors to prevent theft 

when delivering luggage to guests’ rooms. Front desk 

staff can also subtly discourage guests from actions 

that leave them vulnerable to crime, such as flashing 

their room key cards with room numbers. Our staff 

are trained to manage such delicate situations in a 

professional manner to ensure the safety of our guests.

5.3.2.3 Public Areas Patrol

Technology has come a long way in helping hotels 

upgrade basic security measures. Closed-circuit TV 

cameras with recording systems are essential for 

securing such busy public spaces such as bars, lounges, 

parking lots, and loading bays. However, these areas 

also allow open access to disruptive persons, muggers 

and pickpockets. Monitoring of the camera images by 

staff and proper lighting reduces the chances for such 

crimes.

5.3.2.4 Staff Training

Hotel guests can participate in relevant safety 

programmes carried out by the hotel. Our hotel staff 

are trained with the objective of ensuring a consistent, 

professional response to emergencies. Our staff 

are empowered to take responsibility in addressing 

unusual behaviour that occurs on hotel property, 

without jeopardising their own safety.

5.3.3 Data Safety and Privacy

Ensuring safety and privacy of our customers’ data is 

our priority. We handle and communicate sensitive 

and confidential information of our customers 

such as guest registration, home addresses and 

credit card information with due care to ensure our 

customers’ data are managed in accordance to the 

level of confidentiality. We observe local laws and 

internal regulations applicable to personal information 

protection.

5.4 

Partnering Our Suppliers

5.4.1 

Our Approach

Our supply chain activities can be split into two 

broad categories: corporate supply chains and hotel 

supply chains. Our corporate supply chains cover 

procurement for our corporate offices. At the hotel 

level, supply chains cover procurement for items 

required for running a hotel and cover a wide range 

of items including food, linens, cleaning supplies and 

furniture. We believe that building strong relationships 

with our suppliers is essential in achieving sustainable 

business practices throughout our supply chains. We 

recognise that it is a continuously evolving process 

and hence, we have to be pragmatic in terms of 

communication and expectation of our key suppliers.

5.4.2 

Supplier Selection

Our key suppliers are selected through our supplier 

selection process. When selecting our key suppliers, 

we examine criteria such as financial health, quality of 

products and services and competitiveness of pricing. 

Our final decision on supplier selection will be based 

on the overall assessment which takes a balanced view 

across all selection criteria.

5.4.3 

Supplier Review

We review the performance of our key suppliers to 

determine whether to extend our partnership with 

them. Such review process allows us to evaluate and 

ensure that our key suppliers’ services and products 

aligns to our business requirements and sustainability 

objectives.

5.5 

Supporting Our Community

5.5.1 

Our Approach

We believe in giving back to the communities we 

conduct our business in. Over the years, we have 

been providing support to local schools, families 

with financial difficulties and disaster relief efforts. To 

this end, our engagement programmes encompass 

financial and practical support to carefully selected 

beneficiaries, such as fundraising and voluntary 

activities like donations of cash and necessities.

These continuous out-reach efforts have fostered 

goodwill, improved relations and communication, 

and helped to nurture a stable and peaceful local 

environment.

Our community initiatives are managed according 

to how closely they align with our own community 

engagement goals, the anticipated staff participation 

rate, and the tangible impact on the beneficiary.

5.5.2 

Our Community Initiatives Highlight

• Blood Donation Drive

 

Holiday Inn Resort Phuket regularly supports the 

Phuket blood bank by providing its function room 

for the blood donation drive organised by a local 

hospital.

• Contributing to flood relief efforts

 

Holiday Inn Resort Phuket management and staff 

donated drinking water and other necessities to 

help people affected by the floods in Southern 

Thailand.

• Beach Clean-up and Mangrove Planting

 

Holiday Inn Resort Phuket management and staff 

participated in the Patong Beach clean-up as well 

as mangrove planting in North Phuket. This is to 

protect and maintain a healthy ecosystem and to 

mitigate the effects of climate change.

6.1 Energy Usage and CO2 Emissions

Direct and indirect CO2 emissions from fuel and electricity consumptions are measured in GHG emissions in 

kgCO2e while electricity consumption is measured in kilowatt hour (kWh). We purchased fuel and electricity from 

non-renewable sources.

Our business and function grow over time and the GHG emissions and electricity consumption patterns vary. 

To ensure consistency and comparability of the GHG emissions and electricity consumption measures over 

time, we create a GHG emission index and electricity consumption index for our performance monitoring. The 

index adjusts the GHG emissions and electricity consumption for the size of our activities. We normalise the 

amount of GHG emissions and electricity consumption by the amount of our revenues which we use as a proxy 

of the size of our activities. The GHG emission index is measured in kgCO2e per SGD million and the electricity 

consumption index is measured in kWh per SGD million.

FY2020 Performance

The GHG emission index and electricity consumption index are 32.6% and 30.6% higher than our base year 

2017 and is behind our year-to-year expectation of 1.9% improvement.

Although electricity consumption (in kWh) was 67% lower than FY2019, low revenue due to the onset of the 

COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in a higher index. Revenue was adversely affected by temporary hotel 

closure and low occupancies amid the COVID-19 pandemic whilst certain electricity usage is still necessary 

for the maintenance and hygiene of the hotel. Hence, our performance in FY2020 may not be comparable 

to prior years with normalised business activities.

We will continue to monitor our performance and work towards our 2030 goals of 10% improvement from 

2017 level.

 

6.2 Paper Consumption

We capture the data for paper consumption by the number of reams used, where one ream is equivalent to 

500 sheets of paper. To ensure consistency and comparability across various paper sizes, such as A3 and A4 

papers, we measure paper consumption by the weight of paper used which is adjusted for the various sizes and 

quality of papers.

Our business and function grow over time and the paper consumption patterns vary. We devise a paper 

consumption index for our performance monitoring. The index adjusts the paper consumption for the size of 

our activities. We normalise the weight of paper consumed by the amount of our revenues which we use as a 

proxy of the size of our activities. The paper consumption index is measured in kilograms per SGD million.

base year 2017 and is behind our year-to-year expectation of 1.3% improvement.

We reduced paper consumption by 63% this year with the digitalisation of certain processes but the lower 

revenue as explained in section 6.1 above resulted in a higher index. Our performance in FY2020 may not be 

comparable to prior years with normalised business activities.

This is mainly due to temporary hotel closure and low occupancies amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Although 

electricity and water consumption was 67% and 48% lower than FY2019 respectively, low revenue due to the 

onset of the COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in higher indicators. Our performance in FY2020 may not be
