DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

We are a leading fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) (“Group“) in Singapore 

that manufactures, markets, and distributes consumer essentials. Our FMCG 

distribution network is mainly in Singapore and Malaysia, as well as in China 

and other countries. Our top products are rice, oil, detergent, soy based 

foods and tissue paper, in addition to a wide portfolio of food and non-food, 

as well as ambient and chilled products. We also have two manufacturing 

facilities in Malaysia of paper products for personal hygiene such as tissue 

paper, and in Singapore for soy based food products such as Tofu.

INCREASING PRODUCT RANGE WITH SUSTAINABLE VALUE CHAIN

An international study conducted by Unilever reveals that a third of 

consumers are now choosing to buy from brands they believe are doing social 

or environmental good. This is especially true for consumers in emerging 

economies as these are the places where negative impact of unsustainable 

business practices, such as water and energy shortages, food poverty, and 

poor air quality is most felt.

The Group constantly seeks 

opportunities to bring more 

quality products to the 

consumer market, and this 

includes products from a 

sustainable value chain. 

We will continue our effort 

to create awareness of 

sustainable development 

practices with stakeholders.

STRATEGY AND  

ANALYSIS






Sales of Unilever products that have integrated sustainability 

grew 50%1 faster than the rest of the consumer goods giant 

in 2016. We have also observed a similar trend in its product 

portfolio. One of our top selling products, Royal Umbrella rice, is 

sourced from a reputable business partner with exemplary Good 

Agricultural Practices (GAP). Its brand story tells how adoption 

of GAP led to more stable income for small-holder farmers in 

addition to better environmental protection and improved crop 

yield.  It is a story of sustainable business practices that go hand 

in hand with an improved business proposition. This improved 

business proposition includes greater brand equity for one of 

the world’s top brand names and better risk management of 

raw material supply.

CHALLENGES

Our long term objective of increasing a product mix with greater 

integration of a sustainable value chain is not without difficulty. 

These challenges are sometimes related to a lack of consumer 

awareness. Our effort to support sustainable value chains is 

driven by product acceptance by customers.

OUTLOOK

The Group constantly seeks opportunities to bring more quality 

products to the consumer market, and this includes products 

from a sustainable value chain. We will continue our effort to 

create awareness of sustainable development practices with 

stakeholders. We began engaging end consumers through 

social media such as dedicated Facebook accounts for each one 

of our top brands as of March 2017. This is one of our platforms 

for creating public awareness about product responsibility and 

consumer health.

We also intend to conduct a rebranding exercise for one of 

our key brands, Beautex, a leading brand for personal hygiene 

paper products. Its revitalised image will be one initiative to 

more aptly reflect the Group’s integration of sustainable 

development practices by creating greater public awareness of 

sustainable value chains.

The Board considers sustainability issues, especially social 

responsibility, as part of the Group’s strategic formulation. As a 

fast-moving consumer goods company, product responsibility 

for customer health and safety is the primary material aspect 

of our sustainable development integration. At our tissue paper 

products manufacturing arm, workplace safety and supplier 

assessment for environmental impact are the key material 

aspects.

As stakeholders are placing increasing emphasis on sustainable 

development integration, the Group is allocating more resources 

on the management and monitoring of material aspects that 

impact our sustainable development integration.

PROFILE


In Singapore, we recently modernized our manufacturing operations for soy bean 

food products shifting it to a new factory block next to our headquarters in Jalan 

Boon Lay. The new facility became operational in July 2017. In Malaysia, we are 

expanding our production facility for tissue paper products. We expect our new 

facility to be operational in Q4-2018.

The Group’s policy is to continually ensure that all our supplies are purchased from 

sustainable sources. We suspend procurement of fast moving consumer goods as 

well as raw materials from suppliers which are reported to have engaged in errant 

practices until there is reasonable assurance that the offending practice has been 

rectified.

CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP PROGRAM

The Group has a long history of active community development 

work as we believe it is important to help the less fortunate. 

We have committed ourselves to a corporate citizenship 

program to positively impact the communities we serve – be it 

needy families, the elderly poor, or other less fortunate groups 

of people.

In our four decades of providing consumer essentials, we have 

been a regular sponsor of a multitude of grass root events 

organized by the People’s Association, under Singapore’s 

Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth. Such sponsorships 

are a strategic part of our business model that enable us to 

contribute to community development and social cohesiveness, 

and enhance public awareness of our household brands.

We actively collaborate with government agencies and our 

business partners to organize community development 

programs that range from art competitions that provide a 

platform for artistic expression by school children, fund raising 

for persons with disabilities, rice donation, to meal boxes for 

the elderly poor.

GOVERNANCE








• 

Stakeholder engagement is a daily part of our business in the course of our 

cooperation with manufacturers, suppliers, corporate buyers such as NTUC 

Fairprice, and government bodies to deliver a diverse range of consumer 

essentials.

• 

When engaging each stakeholder group, we consider the group’s impact on the 

demand for our products, as well as the staff and investment resources involved. 

The order in the 102-40 list represents how we often prioritize stakeholders.

• 

We typically engage each stakeholder group annually, be it through trade 

exhibitions or customer surveys with follow-on activities on a case by case basis. 

Each key operating subsidiary has various community development programs, 

and many of these programs are carried out annually.

• 

We collaborate with external stakeholders to promote the integration of sustainable 

practices in the value chains of our wide range of fast moving consumer goods.

• 

Our manufacturing facilities conduct annual customer surveys to solicit feedback 

on product quality, on-time delivery, after-sales service, and our product pricing.



Rice, oil, paper, and soybeans are among the more important raw materials in our 

business. There are upstream activities undertaken by external stakeholders that 

are critical to the overall supply chain sustainability of the natural resources from 

which our products are derived. Key topics include sustainable agricultural and 

production practices related to rice farming, farmer’s livelihood, food safety, and forest 

conservation.

We are looking into the following areas of stakeholder interest:

• 

Innovation

• 

Reduction in packaging

• 

Advocacy and assistance for partner organizations to adopt best practices

• 

Greater staff welfare

REPORTING APPROACH AND FRAMEWORK

We refer to the Global Reporting Initiative (2016) (“GRI”) as 

a framework for disclosure inclusion. Disclosures revolve 

around the value chains in our key business segments including 

Topseller, Tipex, and Fortune Food Manufacturing. We have 

prioritized our scope of reporting as follows:

• 

Brands that have the greatest impact to the Group’s 

revenues.

• 

Activities that contribute to our product brand equity.

• 

Industry standards that are considered important by 

stakeholders such as customers, principals, suppliers, 

and shareholders.

TOPIC BOUNDARIES

We aim to create public awareness about the sustainable value 

chains behind our key brands. Metrics applicable to GRI core 

disclosures are reported only if they are a good representation 

the impact of our value chains. For example, we do not report 

the percentage of suppliers assessed for social impact because 

many of them have relatively low impact on cost of goods 

sold and business revenue. Rather, we focus on discussing 

the management approach of principal suppliers based on 

each one’s upstream social and environmental impact and 

downstream business impact through the Group.

network 

covers 

supermarkets, 

grocery stores, caterers, institutions, ship chandlers, hotels, 

restaurants, food courts, and hawker centres in Singapore.

Rice is the Group’s top selling fast moving consumer product 

category and Royal Umbrella is our best-selling brand of rice. 

The rice supply chain starts with the preparation of land and 

seed and ends with the consumption of the rice on the table. 

It includes all of the economic activities undertaken between 

these phases including processing, delivery, wholesaling and 

retailing. 

The key risk factors to this supply chain include:

• 

Sustaining the environmental integrity of arable land to 

ensure the soil is productive.

• 

Farmers’ ability to access means of production.

• 

Farming practices to ensure food safety.

As a marketing and distribution business for fast moving 

consumer goods, it is the Group’s strategy to educate 

consumers on aspects of the value chain that affect their 

ultimate purchasing decisions. We aim to use this sustainability 

report as a platform for stakeholders as well as consumers to 

understand issues at stake in the value chain of a staple such 

as rice.

It is intended to be part of a larger feedback loop that leads 

to better informed decision making by consumers. This will 

ultimately enhance our capability to improve product mix and 

add value to our product range.

This section focuses on good agricultural practices (GAP) and 

draws on guidelines published under United Nations reporting 

framework, Sustainable Assessment of Food and Agriculture 

Systems.

Thailand’s 13 million 

farmers grow it. 

Thailand is one of the world’s largest rice exporting nations. Rice is its 

most important crop and about 60% of Thailand’s 13 million farmers 

grow it. However, many smallholder rice farmers struggle with volatile 

rice paddy prices, high cost of farming equipment, inability to afford 

fertilizers and pesticides, and risk of crop failure. Some of them sell 

the arable land that they own and make a living out of in order to pay 

off debt and eventually end up as manual laborers on large commercial 

farmlands.

ACCESS TO MEANS OF PRODUCTION

Farmers’ ability to access means of production are critical to their 

ability to build a decent livelihood for themselves and their families. 

Means of production include knowledge, land, seeds, and equipment 

required for the farmer to meet the output level necessary to maintain a 

decent livelihood and cover his costs of production. Such costs include 

seed, fertilizer, pesticide, manpower, purchasing or renting equipment 

for farm operations to run efficiently and complete the harvest without 

facing debt loads that could destabilize the farm’s operation. If there 

is no protection of farmers’ capability for production, food security is 

compromised and the upstream supply of paddy for rice production will 

be at risk.

SUSTAINABLE RICE

PRODUCTION




In 1986, Hanwell Holdings Limited (formerly known as PSC 

Corporation Ltd) wanted to distribute jasmine rice, a long-grain 

strain of fragrant rice, from CP Intertrade in Thailand (the rice 

processing arm of Asia’s largest agribusiness conglomerate 

Chaoren Pokphand). In those days, few Thai products were 

labelled in English. Hanwell worked with its rice processing 

partner to identify an English brand name for jasmine rice 

imported from Thailand. Hanwell and CP Intertrade eventually 

decided to use “Royal Umbrella” as the brand name to distribute 

Thai Hom Mali rice to English speaking consumer markets. The 

brand name was subsequently translated into other languages.

Today, Royal Umbrella Thai Hom Mali rice has become 

Thailand’s top export brand. CP Intertrade processes different 

sub-brands of rice according to the diverse cultural palates of 

each market. The quality of rice paddy that is trucked into its 

processing facilities, state-of-the-art production equipment, a 

strong marketing and distribution network, as well as strong 

R&amp;D all play a part in the success of this brand name.

In Singapore, Royal Umbrella has been awarded the annual Reader’s 

Digest Trusted Brands for 14 years running.

Engaging farmers to adopt GAP is the first stage of this success 

story. The Royal Umbrella Hom Mali rice supply chain starts 

from providing farmers with top grade grains for planting and 

culminates in international rice tasting competitions such 

as the World Best Rice award organized by the World Rice 

Conference. Royal Umbrella Hom Mali rice bagged the World 

Best Rice award which was held in the Philippines in 2009. 

In Singapore, Royal Umbrella has been awarded the annual 

Reader’s Digest Trusted Brands for 14 years running - from 

2004 to 2017. Recently, it won the Platinum award in 2017.

DECENT LIVELIHOOD FOR SMALLHOLDERS

Mr Thiti Lujintanon, Executive Vice President, Rice Business, CP 

Intertrade, explained how the company worked with farmers to 

implement GAP.

“We started recruiting farmers to be members of our 

sustainability rice farming program in 2012 to promote good 

agricultural practices. The program was very successful in 

securing for us a reliable supply of high quality Hom Mali rice 

paddy as well as improving the income of farmers who joined 

our GAP co-operative,” said Mr Lujintanon.

The rice processing company works with government officials 

from Thailand’s Rice Department to educate farmers on GAP 

that protect the environment. “Hom Mali rice is our top product 

category. 

Our co-operative farmer membership for Hom Mali rice has 

more than doubled over the past 5 years (from 400 farmers 

in 2012 to 3,500 farmers currently). The size of arable land 

farmed by our members has multiplied 5 times to about 30,000 

acres over the same period because it truly helps farmers. 

We have also seen similar success with our Japonica rice 

co-operative program. We are targeting to expand the arable 

farmland under our GAP co-operative this year.

“Farmers are typically able to improve their crop yield by 5% 

after switching from traditional farming methods to the GAP 

methods that we provide training and support for. We are 

targeting to expand this differential in crop yield to 10%. That 

will help the farmers more. 

“Crop yield improves 

after farmers switch to 

the Good Agricultural 

Practices that we 

provide training and 

support for.”

“We are confident of good crop yield. The government gives our 

member farmers priority in irrigation assistance should there 

be a drought. We undertake to buy 100% of our members’ 

harvest. Our offtake prices vary according to rice grade. For 

top grade Hom Mali unmilled rice paddy, we pay 3% above the 

market price,” he said.

MANAGING CROP SUPPLY RISK

“We get better paddy for the premium that we pay to our 

member farmers. When we remove the husk from the rice 

paddy, we get a higher yield of full grain rice that makes 

the grade. Without GAP, we have experienced problems 

with broken grains which we had to reject as by-products.  

All in all, paying the premium for a guaranteed yield makes 

better business sense in terms of cost of goods sold. Because 

the premium is marginal, it is something that end-consumers 

can afford and have been willing to pay for. “Our production 

process is now rigorous enough to trace each bag of rice to 

the group of farmers the paddy is sourced from. Without the 

farmer membership co-operative program, we would not know 

where our rice paddy comes from,” said Mr Lujintanon.

“Sourcing paddy from a farmer membership co-operative 

program enables us to guarantee there is no adulteration in 

rice variant as well as food safety for consumers,” he said.

manufactured daily in our HACCP certified production facility 

in Singapore and delivered to local supermarkets, F&amp;B retail 

outlets, as well as general trade outfits such as provision shops 

and minimarts in Singapore via our chilled delivery trucks.

Our production process consumes about 1,000 metric tons of 

raw soybeans per year.

Foodborne diseases can be a widespread public health problem 

and even adversely impact the economy as seen during the 

SARS outbreak. Thanks to the stringent regulation by the 

Agri-Food &amp; Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA), Singapore 

enjoys one of the lowest incidences of foodborne disease 

outbreaks compared to the rest of the world.

The Group views any incident of food contamination  seriously 

as this will affect our reputation, brand value, sales, and even 

bottom line in the event of product recall.

We have a robust system in place to prevent incidences of food 

contamination.

We work closely with AVA to ensure that all our food products

How we manage Occupational Health

POLICY

Workers’ welfare is a high priority in our organizational value 

system. We review our OH&amp;S policy every year during the 

Environmental Management Review to ensure its suitability 

and adequacy in the context of all possible changes to our 

operational, legal, and other obligations. We have an open door 

policy that serves as a channel for worker to air grievances.

 

RESOURCES

• 

All our factory workers are required to wear personal 

protection equipment such as mouth masks and ear plugs.

• 

We have provided an eye-wash station for any workers 

that suffers from eye irritation.

The noise level generated by our paper cutting machines  may 

result in hearing loss of a worker handling these machines if 

his naked ear is exposed to the noise over a long period. There 

is also a significant amount of particulate airborne paper fibers 

that are by-produced in the course of cutting paper. We have a 

committee that looks into the Occupational Health and Safety 

(OH&amp;S) of our factory.

COMMITMENT

• 

Take effort to identify, assess and control hazards and 

risks in the workplace

• 

Establish and communicate an OH&amp;S system involving our 

employees

• 

Continually improve our OH&amp;S performance

• 

Comply with all relevant OH&amp;S laws affecting our industry

• 

Conduct self-audits to review our policy, objectives, 

targets, and our performance against these measures

• 

Make available this policy to any interested parties.

Occupational Health: Ear plugs are personal protection equipment for our workers who operate cutting machines.

RESPONSIBILITY

Paper is easily combustible. At our factory, we have a sizable inventory of jumbo paper rolls, work-in-progress as well as finished 

goods for tissue paper, toilet rolls, kitchen towels and restaurant napkins products. We therefore view the risk management of fire 

hazards to be of primary importance. We adopt the ISO 14001 Environment Management System to manage this risk.

POLICY

• 

All areas within our factory compound are strictly non-

smoking, with the exception of an open air space behind 

the guardhouse that is about 30 meters away from the 

production and storage building. We made provision for 

smokers by putting up a clear sign identifying the area that 

is designated for them.

• 

Vehicles are only allowed to refill diesel at a designated 

area about 100 meters away from the production and 

storage areas. Chemical spillage kits of sand buckets are 

available at the diesel refill area.

• 

We have a designated assembly point for headcount 

check in the event of emergency or fire.

RESOURCES

• 

ABC dry powder, CO2, fire extinguishers, fire hydrants, 

hose and hose reels are spread out in the production 

and storage areas. Floor plans that clearly mark out 

the locations of our fire-fighting equipment are visibly 

displayed at different locations in our production and 

storage areas.

• 

Speed limit signs are displayed to remind forklift operators 

not to exceed 5km/hour.

• 

Exit signs are clearly marked on the floor, as well as on 

floor plans that are displayed on walls.

• 

First-aid kits are made easily accessible by workers.

POLICY

• 

We adopt food safety management systems to assure 

consumers that our products meet high sanitary 

standards. For example, we apply HACCP practices for 

food safety in our packaging line where required, such as 

for restaurant napkins. 

• 

To minimize pollution, vehicles that call on our premises 

are not allowed to idle for more than 3 minutes before 

being required to switch off their engines.

RESPONSIBILITY

Our products such as tissue paper and napkins are usually 

used for personal hygiene. If product hygiene systems are not 

strictly implemented, hazards may arise from the use of our 

tissue products.

ACTION

• 

We have 7 plastic packaging suppliers from Malaysia, 

and one from Indonesia. We also have 3 paper packaging 

suppliers in Malaysia. All these suppliers are have received 

ISO 9001 Quality Management certifications as well as ISO 

14001 Environment Management or Good Manufacturing 

Practice (GMP) certifications.

• 

The ink used for printing on customized restaurant 

serviettes is water-based and has been lab-tested to 

ensure there is no toxicity. All chemicals are cleared by 

our purchasing department before being allowed in our 

factory premises.

• 

We require our suppliers to send samples of plastic 

packaging and ink to be lab-tested to ensure there is no 

toxicity in our raw material supply chain.

Product Safety: Workers wear face masks and gloves to ensure product sanitary hygiene.

RESPONSIBILITY

Most of our raw material is paper, and that is produced from 

wood. Deforestation, the clearance of forests for conversion of 

land to a non-forest use, accounts for almost the same carbon 

emissions as the entire world’s transport sector and is a major 

driver of biodiversity loss.

Many of our customers now require our paper products to be 

certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC®).

POLICY

We use only paper procured from FSC® certified suppliers. The 

certification system allows us to identify, purchase and use 

wood, paper and other forest products produced from well-

managed forests and/or recycled materials. We have adopted 

its Chain of Custody system.

We have 8 paper roll suppliers – two from China, two from 

Vietnam, two from Indonesia, one from Taiwan, and one from 

Malaysia. Most of the material for our packaging boxes are 

from recycled sources.
