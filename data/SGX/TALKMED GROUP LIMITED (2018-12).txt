Board statement

TalkMed Group is pleased to present our second Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 31 December 

2018. Our report documents our sustainability performance, progress and the initiatives we have adopted to meet our 

stakeholders’ expectations.

environment

We are aware of our responsibility to conduct our business in an environmentally responsible manner. We strive to 

minimise harmful environmental impacts of our day-to-day practices and integrate sustainable practices across all 

business operations. Through sustainability reporting, we would be able to track the progress of our initiatives and 

create greater environmental consciousness among our community.

At TalkMed, we understand the dangerous effects of improper handling and disposal of medical waste on the 

environment as well as the society. We are therefore committed to adopt the best practices and ensure compliance to 

all relevant regulations. This helps to minimise the risk of disease transmission, air and water contamination, as well 

as soil pollution. We hire licensed and experienced firms to collect, transport and dispose of any biohazardous and 

cytotoxic waste.

social

As a medical service provider, we understand the importance of attracting and retaining talented employees to provide 

exceptional service to our customers. We are committed to enforcing fair labour practices, providing equal opportunities 

and providing a safe working environment for all our employees.

At TalkMed, we have created a culture that fosters innovation and encourage our medical staff to stay up to date with 

the latest development in their field. We provide them with diverse training opportunities and support their professional 

as well as personal development. This helps them to be aware of the latest medical advancement, treatment methods 

and equipment available in the market and allows them to make well-informed decisions for our customers.

Our ultimate goal is to provide quality and safe patient care that exceeds industry standards and responds to the 

needs of our customers. We believe that maintaining a safe environment is a crucial aspect of competent healthcare. 

To protect the safety of both patients and our healthcare professionals, we ensure strict adherence to all applicable 

rules and regulations.

TalkMed values its employees, customers and the community it serves. Our doctors play their part by providing health 

education to the people. They share their knowledge and contribute to raising disease awareness in Singapore and 

neighbouring countries via newspapers, magazines, medical journals and medical educational sessions.

community

We strive to have a positive impact on our community and have collaborated with Singapore Cancer Society (“SCS”) 

to create a difference. As part of our local initiatives, we sponsored and participated in the ”Relay for Life” event in 

Singapore. We also partnered with Breast Cancer Network Vietnam to organise the annual event – the Pink Hat Day 

– to raise breast cancer awareness.

Governance

We understand our role as a member of medical fraternity and uphold the highest standards of corporate governance 

across all our business functions. We strictly adhere to the compliance requirements of a public listed company and are 

committed to providing transparent and relevant information to all our stakeholders on a timely basis.

TalkMed believes our responsibility as a healthcare group goes beyond our business operations. We are committed to 

look for ways to enhance our services and use our resources responsibly. We strive for medical excellence and aim to 

provide the safest services to our valuable customers. We want to thank our stakeholders for their continuous trust 

and support in our sustainability journey.

GRI 102-2 | 102-3 |102-4 |102-5 | 102-6 |102-7 | 102-8

TalkMed through its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) is a premier provider of medical oncology services, stem 

cell transplant services and palliative healthcare services. We are headquartered in Singapore and our operations extend 

to serve the markets in Vietnam as well.

TallkMed was incorporated on 10 September 2013 and listed on the Catalist Board of Singapore Exchange Securities 

Trading Limited on 30 January 2014. The Group structure is as follows:

SCC provides tertiary healthcare services to the oncology patients in the private sector in Singapore, through Parkway 

Cancer Centre (“PCC”). Our highly-trained doctors attend to patients, examine and administer medical treatments, 

perform minor outpatient surgical procedures, prescribe medicines and conduct laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures. 

In addition to the above clinical functions, we review the results of these investigations and provide follow-up patient 

care.

TalkMed is also recognised as one of the leading medical tourism facility in Singapore. This has been made possible by 

the excellent medical service provided by our team of sixteen doctors at nine clinics in facilities operated by Parkway 

Hospitals Singapore Pte. Ltd.. These include Gleneagles Hospital Singapore, Mount Elizabeth Hospital Singapore, Mount 

Elizabeth Medical Centre and Mount Elizabeth Novena Specialist Centre. For the past few years, SCC has established 

itself as one of the market leaders in medical tourism in Singapore with foreign patients accounting for the majority 

of its patient-load.

TalkMed Vietnam was established in March 2014 and we collaborated with Thu Cuc International General Hospital to 

set up a medical centre known as Singapore Cancer Centre Thu Cuc. The centre provides specialist medical oncology 

services in Hanoi, Vietnam.

In September 2017, the Group incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, TalkMed China, to explore healthcare-related 

collaborations in China. Subsequently, TalkMed China incorporated TalkMed Chongqing Pte. Ltd., a 75%-owned 

subsidiary, with the aim of providing healthcare management services in Chongqing, China.

Stem Med, set up in January 2015, is the first private stem cell banking facility in Singapore that specialises in the 

processing, cryopreservation and storage of adult stem cells. In March 2017, Stem Med incorporated Stem Med Indonesia 

Pte. Ltd., a 90%-owned subsidiary, to explore business opportunities in Indonesia in the areas of operation of cellular 

laboratories, storage facilities and cellular therapeutics clinics. In October 2017, Stem Med incorporated DrSG Cellular 

Wellness Pte. Ltd., a 60%-owned subsidiary, with A DrBrand Pte. Ltd. (“ADB”) holding the remaining 40%. Capitalising 

on the expertise of both Stem Med and ADB in the fields of stem cell technology and aesthetics respectively, this 

subsidiary plans to research and produce highly-effective products and technologically-advanced treatments for hair 

rejuvenation and customised skin care for the global beauty market.

About

talkmed

In August 2018, we entered into a shareholders’ agreement with StemCord Pte Ltd and Dr Lim Zi-Yi to incorporate 

CellVec, where the Group holds a 57% stake. CellVec provides cellular and gene therapy services, with a focus on the 

development of novel platform viral vector technologies that strive to advance genetic modification of cellular therapy.

Subsequent to CellVec’s incorporation, the cellular and gene therapy division of Stem Med has been transferred and 

consolidated into CellVec, while Stem Med continues to focus on the provision of services that are related to the 

processing, cryopreservation and storage of stem cells as well as regenerative medicine.

HKH is the controlling shareholder of Hong Kong Integrated Oncology Centre Limited, which provides a comprehensive 

range of services with the concept of “Total Cancer Care” and “Tumor Board Approach”. The services include cancer 

prevention, screening, imaging and diagnosis, multidisciplinary cancer treatment (including radiotherapy through its 

strategic partnership with Hong Kong Adventist Hospital) and after-treatment care in Hong Kong.

At TalkMed, we understand the importance of engaging our stakeholders and identifying the material issues that are 

most important to them. We selected our key stakeholder group based on influence, representation, responsibility, 

dependency and proximity.

In the financial year ended 31 December 2017 (“FY17”), we conducted stakeholder engagement based on a process 

of identification, prioritisation and validation to identify the key material issues.

We firmly believe that stakeholder engagement is a key factor to ensure the success of our business. Therefore, we 

constantly seek to improve our communication channels with all our stakeholders to seek their inputs as well as address 

their concerns.

GRI 102-46 | 102-47 | 103-1

The content and aspect boundaries in this report have 

been developed in alignment with the GRI Reporting 

Principles of Materiality, Stakeholder Inclusiveness, 

Sustainability Context and Completeness.

TalkMed conducted a materiality assessment for our 

inaugural sustainability report published in FY17. This 

was carried out in accordance to the GRI standards and 

it helped us identify material issues that are significant 

to our stakeholders, as well as the social, economic and 

environmental impact of our business operations.

Our key stakeholders were engaged through carefully 

formulated surveys to understand their areas of concerns. 

We then benchmarked ourselves against our peers to 

identify top materiality trends and issues. The materiality 

issues identified shaped our FY17 and FY18 sustainability 

reports. We are committed to updating our materiality 

assessment biennially.

Financial year ending 31 December 2019 (“FY19”)



Why is this a material issue?

The safety and well-being of our customers form the core 

of our organisation’s value. We are committed to providing 

excellent service to our patients at all times and have taken 

several measures to ensure the same.

We have integrated standards and procedures across all our 

operations and installed continuous monitoring systems to 

safeguard the health and safety of our valued customers.

our approach to managing

As customer safety is a crucial aspect of our business, we 

ensure strict adherence to government regulations such as 

Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act, Medicines Act, 

Health Products Act, Singapore Medical Council Ethical Code 

and Ethical Guidelines.

We have in place a set of clinical standard operating 

procedures (“SOPs”) to maintain competency among staff 

and compliance with the applicable regulations and laws.

As a provider of medical services, we believe the professional 

capability of our nurses is a direct reflection of the quality 

of our services. We have therefore, placed a system of 

competency checklists to assess and evaluate their proficiency. 

In addition to this, we also have an apheresis competency 

checklist, as our operations require handling blood products. 

The above SOPs and checklists are reviewed every year for 

relevance and completeness.

There were no incidents of non-compliance concerning the

Why is this a material issue?

Our employees are the foundation of our business and 

the secret to our long-lasting success. They are integral to 

our ability to provide exceptional medical services to our 

customers and consistently improve our performance. As they 

are our most valuable assets, we are committed to providing a 

challenging work environment for our workforce of talented 

doctors and specialists.

our approach to managing

We are aware that our ability to attract, develop and retain 

highly motivated employees is critical for our business.

Our human resource team follows fair and supportive policies 

which are in line with our objectives. We have an equitable 

system of recognition and awards that allows doctors the 

opportunity to participate in revenue-sharing schemes. Our 

staff is awarded attractive year-end bonus that commensurate 

with their performances. In addition to the above, we promote 

annual subsidised holidays to promote staff bonding. We 

recognise and acknowledge the contribution of our long-

serving staff by rewarding them with long service awards.

We aim to have the very best talent and also work towards 

ensuring that each role is filled by a candidate who is qualified 

and of the right fit. Therefore, we have delegated this crucial 

task of recruiting new doctors to our Chief Executive Officer 

and Chief Operating Officer, while the hiring of new clinical 

staff is entrusted to nurse management and human resource 

department. This helps us to identify candidates with high 

potential who can contribute meaningfully to the Group.

Why is this issue material?

TalkMed places strong emphasis on developing talent 

through training and education programmes. It is necessary 

for our doctors and specialists to be updated with the latest 

development in their field to perform to the best of their 

abilities. Therefore, we provide opportunities for holistic 

improvement in their competency level and help them reach 

their full potential.

our approach to managing

To enable employees to refine their skills, we organise regular 

training and development programmes to cater to their 

area of specialisation. We offer our nurses fully-sponsored 

diploma courses to help them upgrade their qualifications. 

We have fostered a culture of learning in our organisation 

and we encourage regular feedback to identify new areas of 

improvement.
