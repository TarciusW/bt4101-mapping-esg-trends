SuSTAINABILITY AT ISETAN

Integrity and responsible business practices are 

a core part of Isetan’s DNA. Our approach to 

sustainability embodies the Japanese culture of 

“Omotenashi”, whereby we strive to treat our 

customers to the best of our ability. This helps us 

to achieve our vision of becoming an indispensable 

department store for each customer by providing 

high quality goods for different aspects of their 

lives. We are also guided by our core values such 

as integrity, trust and accountability, and our code 

of conduct, which governs the way we interact on 

a day-to-day basis with our employees, customers, 

business partners, environment and the community 

at large.

Governing Sustainability at Isetan

Following the announcement of the SGX 

sustainability reporting guidelines, we have 

formalised the execution, monitoring and 

governance of our sustainability risks and 

opportunities.

Our material risks and opportunities are managed 

at the store by different business functions which 

then report to the senior management. The 

senior management assesses the performance 

and updates the Board which takes on the overall 

responsibility for providing governance and 

guidance.

Materiality Assessment

The SGX guidelines on sustainability reporting have allowed us to realign our existing sustainability 

practices from the view point of materiality. We conducted our Materiality Assessment in accordance to 

the “GRI Standards’ Principles for defining report content”.  We review our selected material sustainability 

factors regularly. The initial selection was conducted in FY2017 where we engaged with our employees 

and management to seek their feedback and validated the results with the Board to arrive at the final 

list of material factors to be looked at. For FY2018, we have decided to continue focusing on the same 

material sustainability factors so as to track our performance and progress in these areas. A summary 

of these factors are shown in the matrix below. We have aligned these topics into three key pillars: 

environment, people and customers.

ENvIRONMENT

ENERgY cONSuMpTION

Energy consumption is a significant impact arising 

from our buildings. Electricity is crucial to our daily 

operations; from the operation of refrigerators in 

our supermarkets to the lights and air conditioning 

in our department stores. Higher energy 

consumption generates Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 

emissions which contribute to climate change. 

Minimising our carbon footprint not only helps 

us reduce our operational costs, but also aligns 

with our company philosophy and precautionary 

principle approach towards the environment.

MAnAGEMEnT APPROACh

We have implemented a series of practices and 

initiatives to minimise our energy consumption 

by improving energy efficiency at our stores and 

investment property.

Switching to LED Lighting

Over the years, we have embarked on a phased 

journey to replace conventional lighting with 

energy efficient LED lights. The investment 

property at Wisma Atria runs on LED lighting and 

approximately 75% of our department stores have 

also been retrofitted.

Significance of impacts

h

h

Importance to stakeholders

Implementing energy conservation system

We have been implementing energy conservation 

systems (Z-CEP) that lower fluctuations and reduce 

consumption at our older stores. 

Replacing chillers with energy efficient models 

Chillers contribute a significant share of our total 

energy consumption. This year, we replaced one 

chiller with energy efficient options which resulted 

in approximately 20% energy savings.

Energy saving practices at the shop floor

We implement energy saving measures at our 

stores and encourage our staff to practise the 

same. For example, we reduce lighting usage 

just before closure of stores and only start our 

escalators five minutes before opening.

Operating in the service industry, Isetan considers 

its people as the greatest asset that serve as a vital 

point of contact between our customers and the 

company. Therefore, it is our top priority to equip 

them with the necessary skills they need to be at 

their best. With a team of 600 people, we hope to 

continue improving their skills required to meet the 

ever-changing demands of the industry.

MAnAGEMEnT APPROACh

We invest in our human resources by identifying 

the right talent, providing the best training 

opportunities and taking care of their welfare. 

Talent attraction

We employ fair and equal opportunity practices 

in selecting a diverse workforce.  Our collective 

bargaining agreement covers all locally engaged 

employees except staff holding managerial, 

executive or confidential positions. 72% of our 

employees are covered by collective bargaining 

agreements.

Working with recruiting partners, we recruit 

workers from a number of Asian and South-East 

Asian countries that bring added value to our 

international customers. 

Creating a strong talent pipeline in our industry 

is crucial and we believe we can make an impact. 

As part of our learn @ Isetan programme with 

Skills Future, we offer internship opportunities 

to local polytechnics and ITE students which 

provide them exposure to the retail industry and 

work opportunities post completion. This year we 

offered attachments to six Polytechnic  and two 

ITE students.

Training and development

Training begins right at the induction stage of our 

new hires. We focus on basic sales and service 

which includes “Omotenashi”, the Japanese way 

of service. Our employees then go through a host 

of training programs including sales, customer 

handling, inventory control, merchandise handling 

and personal data protection. 

Selected senior talent are sent to our Japan office 

for training and become trainer of trainers when 

they return to Singapore. We had 1 management 

staff who went to Japan in 2018. In addition we 

also sent 1 management staff to Japan to gain 

on-the-job experience and understanding of the 

Japanese approach to customer engagement.

Besides sending our staff abroad for training, 

seconded staff from our holding company, who 

are assigned to our sales and merchandising 

departments, also share their know-how by 

working and interacting with our staff.

pRODucT QuALITY

Product quality particularly that of our food 

products at our supermarkets, is a key risk which 

can lead to significant reputational damage and 

legal consequences. This risk arises around the 

safety of food items that we sell and the hygiene 

of our stores. Therefore, numerous controls and 

policies have been implemented to ensure that all 

our stores are safe and the products we deliver 

are of the best quality and up to the highest food 

hygiene standards.

MAnAGEMEnT APPROACh

Maintaining high food safety standards

Food safety in Singapore is governed by the Agri-

Food	 &amp;	 Veterinary	 Authority	 of	 Singapore	 (AVA)	

and we ensure that we are fully in compliance with 

their regulations. All our food suppliers ensure that 

they	get	AVA	approval	for	their	products	and	all	our	

importers ensure that the supplies are correctly 

labelled	and	have	gone	through	the	AVA	tests.	We	

only procure from suppliers and importers that 

meet these standards. 

At the store, we have implemented a number of 

safety precautions. We follow a first-in, first-out 

approach to minimise expired products and food 

inspections are carried out on a regular basis. 

Food that is once opened is not sold and extra 

care is taken in handling cold storage and fresh 

food items. 

Ensuring hygiene at our premises 

Our employees are trained to maintain the highest 

standard of hygiene to avoid any issues of non-

compliance with the National Environment Agency 

(NEA) regulations. Our staff go through courses 

on hygiene that are conducted by NEA authorised 

schools. In addition, we have prepared a manual 

on hygiene which guides our employees with best 

practices such as wearing masks and hair caps 

during food preparation; segregating cooked 

and raw food; ensuring nothing is kept on the 

ground etc. Above all, our “Company Philosophy” 

campaign instils amongst our employees the 

culture of maintaining high hygiene standards and 

freshness.

cuSTOMER SATISfAcTION

Customer satisfaction is crucial, particularly for 

a B-to-C business like ours. In a world of rapidly 

growing e-commerce market, the retail industry is 

constantly being challenged to improve customer 

experience and retain traffic at the stores. 

Furthermore, with today’s social media, any 

negative publicity can lead to immense reputational 

damage and a loss of customers in a short span 

of time. Hence, ensuring that our customers have 

an enjoyable experience while shopping at Isetan 

is imperative to us and we will take all steps in 

enhancing their shopping journey.

MAnAGEMEnT APPROACh

We strive to differentiate ourselves with exceptional 

merchandise, service and environment. 

Living the”Company Philosophy”

All our staff participate in the annual “Company 

Philosophy” campaign in an effort to continually 

improve our customer experience. All frontline staff 

undergo our revised “Sales Skill Up Programme 

(SSP)” which equips them in Omotenashi Service.

Managing our customers

Customers’ complaints are delicately handled by 

experienced managers to ensure that a satisfactory 

response is provided in a timely manner. 

Securing our customer data  

As a retail business, we handle a significant amount 

of personal data of our customers and recognise 

the importance of keeping this information secure. 

We conduct our business in compliance with 

the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), which 

guides us with the collection, use and disclosure of 

personal data. We have safeguards against external 

attempts to breach any confidential information.

cORpORATE SOcIAL RESpONSIBILITY

There is growing evidence of positive correlation 

between community investments and value 

creation for companies; particularly companies 

like ours which are closely associated with the 

communities in which we operate. We also 

notice that socially responsible companies are 

at an advantage of attracting millennial talent 

to their workforce. As a household brand name 

in Singapore, Isetan is committed to being a 

responsible	 corporate	 citizen	 and	 to	 making	 a	

positive impact on the community.

MAnAGEMEnT APPROACh

Isetan has been supporting the community through 

the Isetan Foundation since 1981. The Foundation’s 

commitment is to disburse the dividends from 

its shareholdings in Isetan (Singapore) Ltd and 

has assisted other charitable institutions whose 

objectives are similar to those of the Foundation.

Fostering Education

The Foundation has provided grants to the major 

universities in Singapore to establish endowment 

funds which in turn generate income to fund 

scholarships annually for undergraduates with the 

core priority to those in financial difficulties. With 

the inclusion of NUS in 2017, the total grants to the 

three Universities-National University of Singapore, 

Nanyang Technological University and the 

Singapore Management University have amounted 

to almost $1.4m. 

Since 2012, the Foundation has also funded 

bond-free scholarships at Temasek Polytechnic-

School of Retail Management and the ITE valued 

at $18,000 per annum and $8,000 per annum 

respectively. As at 2018, over 80 students from 

both institutions have received the scholarships 

with the majority scheduling their industry 

internships at Isetan (Singapore) Ltd.
