SERIAL SYSTEM LTD / SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

About This Report

This is the third Group Sustainability Report by Serial System 

Ltd. The report outlines the Group’s sustainability strategies, 

initiatives and performance in relation to Environmental, 

Social	and	Governance	(“ESG”)	issues	for	the	financial	year	

ended 31 December 2019 (“FY2019”). Through this report, 

we hope to share our sustainability commitments with our 

various stakeholders, including investors, customers, business 

partners, suppliers, staff, the community and government 

and regulators.

 

Message from the Board

Climate change, changing consumer expectations as 

well as a volatile global economy remain the drivers of the 

Group’s commitment to design and execute an effective 

Sustainability Management framework. 

Recognising that organisations can add value to the 

community at large, especially in view of the ongoing global 

pandemic and climate situation, the Board continues to 

assess	 and	 refine	 ESG	 aspects	 in	 the	 Group’s	 day-to-day	

operations.

The Board would like to extend its gratitude to all who have 

been with us throughout our sustainability journey. We look 

forward to your continued support and cooperation.

STRATEGY AND GOVERNANCE

As	one	of	the	leading	distributors	of	semiconductor	and	electronic	components	in	the	Asia	Pacific	region,	the	Group	strive	

for sustainable growth as we seek to generate long-term value and sustainable returns for our stakeholders in a socially 

and environmentally responsible manner. We established and periodically review our sustainability strategy in view of the 

existing and emerging risks and opportunities.

The Board has overall responsibility for sustainability for the Group and plans to ensure that our growth is sustainable in the 

long term. The Board determines material ESG factors for sustainability strategy formulation and reporting.

REPORTING FRAMEWORK AND METHODOLOGY

This Report has been prepared in accordance with the sustainability reporting regulatory requirements set out in the 

Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited Listing Manual (SGX-ST Listing Manual): Listing Rules 711A and 711B, and 

the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core Option. A materiality assessment, taking into consideration the 

expectations of our stakeholders, was conducted to identify and prioritise ESG factors that are material to our Group’s 

operations. No independent assurance has been obtained for this Report.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

The Group’s sustainability journey involves identifying our stakeholders and material aspects relevant to our business. Formal 

and informal channels of communication were adopted with both internal and external stakeholders to understand their 

needs, interests and priorities. This enables us to strategise our business decisions and operations, thereby ensuring the 

growth of our business operations and stakeholders’ satisfaction.

The following illustrates the approach the Group undertakes to engage with our key stakeholders:

OUR ECONOMIC

Economic Performance 

We are committed to creating sustainable and long-term business growth, while creating value and positive contribu-

tions for our marketplace and customers, the communities we operate in, our people and the environment.

Despite	economic	performance	weakened	in	2019,	we	will	continue	to	find	ways	to	be	and	remain	resilient	in	the	face	of	

some major changes to our business. By sustaining our energy and motivation, we will build stronger global partnerships with 

existing and potential suppliers and customers, with a focus on our core electronic components distribution business. Over the 

years,	the	Group	has	also	diversified	into	consumer	products	distribution,	investment	holding	of	high-profit	margin	companies	

and other businesses to provide additional income streams with a view to enhance shareholders’ value over the long term. 

 

As a company listed on the Singapore Exchange Limited (“SGX”), we publish a detailed annual report comprising our risk 

management,	corporate	governance	and	financial	performance.	A	summary	of	our	economic	performance	is	provided	

below,	in	line	with	the	GRI	Standards.	For	detailed	financial	results,	please	refer	to	the	financial	statements	in	our	Annual

Value and Supply Chain

The Group is committed to collaborating with transparent, ethical, environmentally and socially responsible suppliers. 

As	such,	we	have	established	a	stringent	pre-qualification	and	procurement	process	to	ensure	the	quality	of	our	supply	

chain. All our suppliers and customers underwent restricted party screening through our automated denied party screen-

ing software which comprise the database from government authorities and international organizations. Our logistics 

service providers are also frequently assessed against their suitability and capability to meet our Group’s requirements 

as well as their adherence with Singapore Customs requirements. We aim to progressively strengthen our supply chain 

processes in FY2020.

We strived to continuously review our growth strategies in order to enhance our value proposition as a distribution inter-

mediary between chipmakers and manufacturers of electronic end-products. As an established distributor with a proven 

track record, we expect to continue this trade for many more years and remain an integral part of the international supply 

chain for chipmakers, original equipment manufacturers and major electronic brands.

OUR ENVIRONMENT

Environment Protection

We	 are	 committed	 to	 minimising	 our	 environmental	 impact	 and	 utilizing	 our	 resources	 efficiently.	 Our	 current	

environmental	impact	may	be	attributed	to	the	use	of	electricity	and	paper	in	our	offices	and	warehouses,	the	use	of	fuel	

in transportation for deliveries of inventories. While our existing carbon footprint from electricity consumption is relatively 

small, we understand the value of reducing energy consumption to mitigate the threat of climate change. We have also 

reduce on printing and presently, use recycled papers whenever possible. Through regular monitoring of our resource 

consumption, we strive to minimize our impact on the environment as we continuously encourage our employees to think 

and act green. 


SERIAL SYSTEM LTD / SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

Energy Consumption and Emissions

Given the nature of our operations, electricity from the grid and fuel consumption in transportation of goods to customers 

via	air	or	sea	freight	are	the	main	sources	of	energy	consumed	at	our	sites.	Our	offices	in	Singapore,	Hong	Kong	and	China	

accounted	for	84%	of	the	total	electricity	consumed.	We	have	also	put	up	reminders	in	our	offices	to	switch	off	office	lights	

and air conditioners when not in use and periodically remind our employees about it.

Based on available data through statements from utility providers in the territories that the Group operates in, the Group 

managed to achieve a slight reduction in electricity consumption in FY2019 (2,059,590 kWh) from FY2018 (2,075,984 kWh). 

The Group’s energy intensity per employee increased to 10.2 GJ in FY2019 from 7.8 GJ in FY2018, mainly due to higher 

attrition rate in FY2019 as a result of the cessation of a long-standing agreement of one of the Group’s single largest 

suppliers in late 2018. The Group’s building energy intensity, however, decreased from 78.2 kWh/m2 in FY2018 to 69.7 

kWh/m2 in FY2019. In line with our building energy intensity, the Carbon Dioxide (“CO2”)	emissions	intensity	for	our	offices	

reduced in FY2019 (49.3 kgCO2e/m2) from FY2018 (53.5 kgCO2e/m2). The Group believes that building energy intensity, 

which measures the “site” energy usage is a better benchmark to measure the Group’s energy consumption as opposed 

to energy intensity per employee. We will strive to maintain or reduce the building energy and CO2 emissions intensity in 

FY2020.

For operations, there was an increase in emissions intensity by revenue in FY2019 (1.07 gCO2e) from FY2018 (0.48 gCO2e). 

In	prior	year,	significant	amount	of	revenue	was	generated	from	the	sales	of	consigned	goods	from	our	single	largest	

supplier.	Upon	the	cessation	of	distributorship,	the	significant	drop	in	revenue	resulted	in	the	increase	in	our	emissions	

intensity by revenue. Airfreight continues to be the main mode of transport for the Group to facilitate our sales. It is our 

goal to strive to continually reduce our emissions of Carbon Dioxide (“CO2”) and play our part to alleviate the impact of 

global warming. We hope to realise this objective next year by better consolidation of our inventories to be transported 

and reduce the use of air freight since air freight generally emits more CO2 per-kilometre than sea freight.

Water Conservation

Our water use is limited to employee consumption and facility maintenance. While it isn’t a material issue for us, however, 

we strived to reduce water consumption and prevent water pollution as our operations could still be impacted in areas 

where the availability of clean water is lacking and sanitation are of concern. We increase awareness of our employees 

by displaying signs in designated areas to serve as a friendly reminder to water users.

In prior years, water conservation was not reported as it isn’t a material issue for us. From FY2019 onwards, we will start 

to track and subsequently report our annual water consumption levels and targets. In FY 2019, we consumed 7,342 m3 

of water and our water consumption intensity is 0.249 m3/m2. We commit to maintain or reduce our water consumption 

intensity in FY2020.

Materials and Waste

Paper is the main sources of waste generated across our Group’s operations. We focus on reducing and recycling our own 

waste to minimise our environmental impact in this area. We continued to lower our environmental footprint by reducing 

paper	costs	from	printing	and	copying	in	our	Singapore	Head	Office.	Our	Singapore	Head	Office	paper	consumption	

level was reduced in FY2019 (462,425 pcs) from FY2018 level (707,723 pcs).

As part of our Group’s initiatives to go digital, we have moved towards digital transactions to reduce paper usage and 

to boost productivity. In FY2019, we implemented two systems which digitized the submission of claims and archival of 

finance	related	documents.	In	quest	of	further	productivity	gains,	we	have	started	to	look	into	robotic	process	automation	

(“RPA”).	Our	Singapore	office	is	currently	using	RPA	to	semi-automate	the	extraction	of	portable	document	formatted	

sales	orders	into	data	uploadable	to	our	financial	system	which	eliminated	manual	effort	in	recording.

On top of that, we encouraged our employees to use shared data folders when accessing information to reduce the need 

for printing. We also adopted the conventional method of reusing one-sided used papers that are without any company 

and	private	confidential	information.	These	paperless	and	paper	reduction	initiatives	have	helped	our	Singapore	Head	

Office	to	reduce	the	total	printing	costs	by	about	34%	from	FY2018.	We	aim	to	record,	monitor	and	reduce	our	paper	

consumption level for the entire Group’s operations by next year.  

 OUR SOCIAL

Profile of Our Workforce

Our people, our greatest asset, are key to the Group’s long term growth and success. We have a diverse workforce 

comprising of employees across various regions. During FY2019, our total headcount reduced by 24% to 728 compared to  

964 in FY2018 due to the restructuring following the termination agreement with one of the Group’s single largest suppliers 

in late 2018 and adverse market conditions. We also welcomed 93 new employees to our Group in FY2019.

All our employees work full-time on a permanent contract. We have employees located in the South Asia and in countries 

such	as	China,	Taiwan,	Hong	Kong	and	South	Korea.	78%	of	employees	are	based	in	China	and	South	Asia	where	the	

majority of our business in electronic components and consumer products distributions is based. 94.4% of our department 

heads,	in	Singapore	Head	Office,	are	Singaporeans	or	Permanent	Residents	hired	from	our	local	community.

Our global turnover rate increased slightly in 2019 (48%) from 2018 (42%). The higher turnover rate was mainly arising from 

lower	management	staff.	Turnover	rate	in	China	was	significantly	higher	than	South	Asia	as	well	as	other	countries.	Other	

than	that,	the	turnover	figures	were	resulted	from	multiple	variables,	including	operational	decisions,	market	conditions,	

generation trends and cultural tendencies.

Diversity and Inclusive

We are committed to providing an inclusive workplace with equal opportunities throughout employment, including the 

remuneration, training and promotion of staff regardless of gender, race, nationality and family status. Our Group has a 

diversified	workforce	across	all	age	groups.	In	FY2019,	about	50%	of	our	workforce	consists	of	millennials	who	have	helped	

to	infuse	new	perspectives,	passion	and	efficiency.	

We maintained a balanced female-male ratio (45% female and 55% male) in our workforce across all regions. In FY2019, 

we increased the new hire rate of male employees in our Group by 18% over FY2018 as well as hiring more employees in 

the 30-50 and over 50 age categories.

We respect and support the international principles of human rights. Our HR policies ban child labour, forced or 

compulsory labour, as well as discrimination. There was no reported incident of child labour, forced or compulsory labour 

and discrimination in FY2019.

Clear guidelines on workplace abuse, harassment and disciplinary matters are established and communicated to all 

employees. Employees are also encouraged to report any grievance through their immediate supervisor. Should any 

further assistance or investigation required, cases will be directed to the human resources department. No grievances 

were recorded in FY2019.  

 

Training and Development

Learning and development within our Group is a decentralized function as each country adopts its own approach based 

on employees’ needs and resources. We actively encourage our employees to enhance and continuously develop their 

skills and knowledge, and also provide sponsorship for them should they express a desire to attend external courses or 

seminars. By empowering our staff with equitable access to the right resources and looking after their well-being, we help 

them to be their best at work, grooming them to be our leaders of tomorrow.

In	 2019,	 our	 employees	 had	 benefitted	 from	 a	 total	 of	 528	 hours	 of	 formal	 training.	 Apart	 from	 these	 formal	 training	

programmes or seminars, our employees also receive in-house and on the job training to develop their technical 

knowledge and relevant skillsets. We will continue to explore means to enhance our employees’ knowledge and skills for 

building a resilient workforce.

Apart from investing in employee’s development, we strived to ensure that our employees are provided with the right 

platform to progress their careers. The HR department monitors and tracks employees’ years of services and their career 

progression. We also believes in linking rewards to performance and has established the Long Service Award to recognise 

employees’ commitment to us.

We carried out our annual performance appraisal reviews, which provide employees with constructive feedback based 

on their performance, goals they set at the beginning of the year and a set of shared leadership competencies.

Occupational Health and Safety

Occupational health and safety (“OHS”) of our people is of utmost importance to us. Effective OHS management is part 

of	risk	management	and	expected	to	enhance	business	efficiency	and	staff	morale.	Across	our	Group,	we	adopted	and	

complied with the ISO45001:2018 standards that also sets out our OHS Policy which is put in place to guide implementation 

of	initiatives	that	promote	OHS.	As	we	are	certified	ISO	22301	(Business	Continuity	Management	System),	it	is	required	

that we measure, monitor, evaluate and analyse our OHS. Through proactively tracking and taking accountability of 

reportable and reported incidents, it helps to create awareness on the importance of a safe and healthy workplace. 

The importance of complying with all relevant laws and legislations in countries where we operate is communicated 

repeatedly to our business divisions. Any case of non-compliance will have to be directly reported to our human resources 

department and management for prompt follow-up actions to be taken. Our Business Continuity Management System 

has	 been	 externally	 audited	 by	 a	 third-party	 accredited	 certification	 body	 to	 ISO	 22301,	 a	 recognized	 international	

standard for Business Continuity Management (“BCM”).

In FY2019, we recorded zero fatalities, severe injuries and occupational diseases involving our employees across the 

Group. Our safety statistics for 2019 remain below the industry average of wholesale and retail trade activities reported 

by the Ministry of Manpower in 2019 Workplace Safety and Health Report and we strive to achieve the same record in 

FY2020.

Local Community Involvement

As a responsible corporate citizen, we share in the concerns of our community and take on the responsibility for its 

improvement by actively giving back to our local community to enrich people’s lives. This is done through our various 

Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) initiatives and efforts. Over the years, we had supported several activities for the 

elderly, the poor and needy, as well as areas like healthcare, education, youth development, arts, culture and heritage.

In FY2019, we donated a total of S$481,000 (approximately S$373,000 ) to various causes and organisations in Singapore. 

For more details on the Company’s CSR efforts, please refer to page 17 to 18 of our Annual Report 2019.

 OUR GOVERNANCE

We are committed to build ethical and transparent business through a framework of sound corporate governance 

principles, practices and processes, to protect and enhance our shareholder value. 

Corporate Governance

We believe that good corporate governance nurtures sound business decisions and organizational performance result 

in strengthened resilience and competitive advantage. The Group remains focused on complying with the principles of 

the Code of Corporate Governance 2018 while achieving operational excellence and delivering long-term strategic 

objectives. The Board of Directors is responsible for the Company’s corporate governance standards and policies, 

emphasizing their importance to the Group.

Our	Board	has	considered	the	benefits	of	diversity	of	Board	Members’	skills,	experience	and	background,	maintains	the	

view that the current Board size and structure is adequate for the existing business operations of the Group. Each director 

has been appointed on the strength of his calibre, experience and stature and is expected to bring valuable range of 

experience and expertise to contribute to the development of the Group’s long-term strategy and business performance.

For detailed disclosure on the application of our corporate governance practices with reference to the Code, please 

refer to the Corporate Governance Report on page 26 to 50 in the Annual Report 2019. Where there are deviations from 

any of the principles of the Code, an explanation has been provided within the Annual Report. 

Business Code of Ethics

Our business principles and practices regarding subjects that may face ethical implications are outlined in an internal 

code of business and ethical conduct. The Code of Conduct provides clear guidance for employees to observe our 

principles such as integrity, honesty, responsibility and accountability across all levels of our organization in the course of 

carrying out their duties. It is published on our corporate website and easily accessible by all employees and stakeholders.

The code provides guidance on matters such as:

•		Conflict	of	interest	and	their	appropriate	disclosures

• Maintaining fair dealing in the conduct of our business and in our relationship with our customers, suppliers and 

    employees

•  Our stance against bribery and corruption

•		Safeguard	personal	data	and	proper	handling	of	confidential	information	

• Compliance with applicable laws and regulations including those relating to insider trading and personal data 

    protection

New hires, as part of their induction programme, are introduced with information about our Code of Conduct as well as 

other related corporate policies, including anti-bribery and corruption, whistle-blowing and business continuity.

Anti-bribery and Corruption

Corruption	can	result	in	significant	damage	to	the	organization,	such	as	loss	of	financial	and	social	capital.	We	adopt	a	

zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. 

At Serial System Ltd, we prohibit corruption in any form, including but not limiting to extortion and bribery. We require all 

employees,	officers	and	directors	to	conduct	business	worldwide	with	integrity,	transparency,	and	in	compliance	with	

applicable	 legal	 requirements	 relating	 to	 bribery,	 corruption,	 anti-money	 laundering	 and	 terrorism	 financing.	 This	 has	

been made clear to all employees, customers, suppliers and business partners. 

The Company has in place a whistle-blowing policy which enables an employee to report or raise concerns over any 

“wrongdoings”	 across	 the	 Group	 in	 relation	 to	 unlawful	 conduct,	 financial	 malpractice	 or	 dangers	 to	 the	 public	 or	

environment directly to the chairman of the Audit Committee, with the “whistle-blower” who has acted in good faith, 

being	provided	confidentially,	victimisation	and	harassment	protection.	The	whistle-blowing	channels	(either	via	postal	

address, telephone, mobile or email address) that are accessible via our corporate website: www.serialsystem.com by 

all stakeholders provide them with secure platforms to raise their concerns. “Wrongdoings” can include fraud, corruption, 

theft, abuse of authority, breach of regulations or non-compliance with the Group’s internal controls and procedures.

On an ongoing basis, the whistle-blowing policy is covered during employee training and periodic communication 

including e-mail sent quarterly to all employees as part of the Group’s efforts to promote awareness of anti-corruption and 

fraud prevention. We will regularly review our policies on anti-bribery corruption and whistle-blowing to ensure that they are 

updated taking into account any related changes in legal and regulatory requirements. Internal audits are conducted to 

ensure	the	efficiency	and	effectiveness	of	our	internal	controls,	risk	management	and	governance	processes.

There	were	zero	confirmed	incidents	of	corruption	in	FY2018	and	FY2019	and	we	aim	to	maintain	this	track	record	in	the	

subsequent reporting periods. 

Regulatory Compliance

The	Group	has	not	been	subject	to	any	fines	or	sanctions	for	contravention	of	any	laws	or	regulations	globally,	including	

those	 relating	 to	 infringements	 of	 environment,	 health	 and	 safety,	 anti-money	 laundering,	 terrorism	 financing	 and	

international trade compliance. We strive to maintain this track record and ensure all queries/allegations received are 

promptly	investigated	and	addressed,	failing	which	may	result	in	either	public	allegations	of	non-compliance	or	significant	

fines	being	levied	on	the	Group.

Through our materiality assessment, we recognise that our core business faces increased risks regarding export control 

laws, anti-bribery and corruption and data governance due to the nature of our business and workforce presence across 

various countries and regions. We are committed to complying with laws and regulations wherever the Group operates 

in. Regular training and communication is provided to employees to keep them updated on the compliance issues that 

affect their functions as we strive to maintain compliance with existing policies and procedures at all times.

The Group has introduced various policies to guide its business conduct, including Export Control Compliance Policy 

(“ECCP”), Anti-bribery and Corruption Policy (“ABC Policy”) and Personal Data Protection Policy (“PDP Policy”)

Export Control Laws

We	do	our	part	in	maintaining	international	peace	and	security	by	having	in	place	country-specific	ECCP	which	sets	the	

framework of operational controls and protocols for the respective business division’s transactions, to be conducted in 

compliance with applicable export control laws and regulations. In order to facilitate our screening reviews, we engaged 

the	 system	 and	 service	 of	 an	 ISO-certified	 third-party	 outsourced	 vendor.	 Likewise,	 any	 updates	 to	 existing	 laws	 and	

regulations are programmed accordingly by them. Our International Trade Compliance (“ITC”) team also periodically 

reviews and communicates major/urgent updates to key personnel or regional ITC gatekeepers and management on a 

need to know basis.

To further strengthen our commitments and minimise the risk of non-compliance, the Group requires all new employees 

to undergo an export control awareness training. Additionally, all existing employees are required to attend a refresher 

training every 18 months to keep them up-to-date on the compliance issues that may affect their functions.

In FY2019, similar to FY2018, we have complied with all relevant export control laws and work with suppliers to minimize 

disruption to our Group’s business operations. We endeavour to maintain our compliance status moving forward.

Cybersecurity and Data Privacy

The pace of digitalization has far exceeded regulation to control and manage data privacy and protection, resulting in 

data breaches that can cost millions, and compromise data. We continue to invest in cybersecurity infrastructure and 

systems to enhance our defence against cyber threats and attacks. Our appointed datacentre provider constantly 

monitors our system to enable early detection of any unauthorized access or abnormal network activities to access our 

network,	programmes	and	data.	On	top	of	that,	we	also	have	in	place	appropriate	measures	to	ensure	the	confidentiality,	

integrity and availability of our Group’s IT assets. This includes establishing Group-wide IT policies and procedures and 

implementing access controls, strengthening data security, raising employee’s IT security awareness by emailing notices 

or articles covering the latest cyber threats and their prevention measures, phishing alerts and cyberattacks, and 

conducting an annual IT disaster recovery exercise to ensure business recovery objectives are met.

Safeguarding the personal data of our customers, suppliers and all other stakeholders is also of utmost importance to us. 

We conduct our business in compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”) in Singapore. Accordingly we 

had put in place a Personal Data Protection Policy which governs the collection, use, disclosure and care of personal 

data. This policy is made available to the public on our corporate website. 

Every year, all new employers must go through our Personal Data Protection Policy and acknowledge their understanding 

over the prevailing risks, handling and protection of sensitive corporate data. We continue to educate our employees 

by conducting training programs when there are any changes in the legislation. On top of that, we aim to complete the 

development of our online refresher training course for PDPA by end of this year.

In FY2019, apart from no major cybersecurity incident that has occurred, there was no substantiated complaint from 

outside parties and from the Personal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”). We will continue to improve our existing 

processes	 to	 safeguard	 confidential	 information	 through	 periodic	 review	 of	 our	 Personal	 Data	 Protection	 Policy	 and	

seeking ways to improve staff training opportunities.

International Trade Compliance

The nature and scope of the Group’s distribution business also make us highly susceptible to being victims of international 

fraud and unlawful activities, especially where trade compliance is concerned. For this reason, the Group engages an ITC 

officer	to	ensure	the	Group	complies	with	international	trade	laws	and	regulation	and	regularly	update	the	management	

and key personnel on developments in international and local trade regulations.

The	ITC	officer	also	leads	the	Group	on	all	ISO	Quality	Accreditations	initiatives.	In	FY2018	and	FY2019,	the	Group’s	

various	entities	obtained	the	following	Trade	&amp;	ISO	Certifications:-

• Serial Microelectronics Pte Ltd – SG Customs TradeFIRST Premium Band dated 16 March 2018

• Serial Microelectronics Pte Ltd – SG Customs Secure Trade Partnership (STP) dated 16 March 2018

• Serial Microelectronics Pte Ltd - ISO22301:2012 Business Continuity Management System (BCMS) dated 31 October 

			2018	and	Re-Certification	on	7	October	2019 

Owing to Serial Microelectronics Inc.’s strong commitment in trade compliance for strategic high-tech commodities, since 

6	December	2016	(and	re-certification	on	31	March	2018),	we	had	been	accredited	with	Taiwan	Bureau	of	Foreign	Trade	

(BOFT)	Certificate	No.	1052850475	as	the	53rd	organization	in	the	entire	Taiwan	and	awarded	the	prestigious	membership	

into BOFT’s quarterly roundtable meetings organized by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan.

Similarly, Serial Microelectronics Pte Ltd on 16 March 2018 was awarded with the Best-In-Class TradeFIRST Accreditation 

which is valid for 3 years and is recognized as a “Secure Trade Partner” with Singapore Customs under the Secure Trade 

Partnership	 (STP)	 Program	 and	 granted	 a	 STP	 Certification	 Membership	 No.	 AEOSG12022018001T	 which	 is	 mutually	

recognized by the World Customs Organization (WCO) matching the standards of Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) 

and U.S. CBP Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT).

In FY2018 and FY2019, Serial Microelectronics Pte Ltd had been listed in the Singapore Customs Website “Hall of Fame” 

together	with	105	companies	in	Singapore	as	Secure	Trade	Partnership	(STP)	Companies.	The	STP	is	a	voluntary	certification	

programme consistent with the World Customs Organisation (WCO) SAFE Framework of Standards to secure and facilitate 

global trade. The programme encourages companies to adopt robust security measures using a risk-based approach 

in their trading operations to improve global supply chain security. By participating in the programme, a company 

demonstrates commitment and willingness in keeping the supply chain secure.
