Letter to Our Stakeholders

Dear Stakeholders,

Sustainability is integral to Keppel’s 

strategy and operations. We are 

anchored by strong values, and  

drive our businesses to contribute 

positively to the communities  

where we operate.

The UN Sustainable Development 

Goals defined global priorities for 

governments, businesses and civil 

society to create a sustainable  

future. As a Group committed to 

providing solutions for sustainable 

urbanisation, we work closely with 

our stakeholders in addressing  

these priorities.

Keppel adheres to the principles and 

guidelines of the Code of Corporate 

Governance 2012 issued by the 

Monetary Authority of Singapore 

(MAS). The MAS has recently set  

up a council to review the Code.  

We will continue to monitor the  

latest developments and implement 

governance best practices that 

support long-term sustainable 

performance.

The Paris Agreement has been 

ratified by more than 140 countries 

and reflects firm international  

resolve to strengthen the global 

response to the threat of climate 

change. In Singapore, the government 

has outlined a Sustainable Singapore 

Blueprint to reduce resource 

consumption, carbon emissions  

and waste generated by industries, 

and more recently, announced 

impending legislation which will  

give new impetus for businesses  

to be more energy and water  

efficient. We support efforts by  

the international community and the 

Singapore government in tackling  

the challenges brought about by 

environmental degradation and 

climate change.

We are committed to minimising  

our environmental impact, and we 

aim to achieve a 16% improvement  

in our carbon emissions from 2020 

business-as-usual levels via a robust 

Group-wide carbon management 

strategy. Energy efficiency initiatives 

implemented across the Group in 

2016 are estimated to have saved 

519,026 GJ of energy, equivalent to  

5.6% of the Group’s total energy 

consumption in 2016. This translates 

to an estimated $27 million in cost 

savings, and an avoidance of 

Anchored by strong values, we drive our 

businesses to contribute positively to  

the communities where we operate.

Group Overview


The UN Sustainable Development 

Goals defined global priorities for 

governments, businesses and civil 

society to create a sustainable future. 

As a Group committed to providing 

solutions for sustainable urbanisation, 

we work closely with our stakeholders 

in addressing these priorities.

approximately 62,000 tonnes  

of carbon dioxide emissions. 

Cumulatively, the Group has saved 

close to 2 million GJ of energy over 

the past five years, which translates 

to a total of about $117 million in  

cost savings, and an avoidance of 

approximately 230,000 tonnes of 

carbon dioxide emissions over  

this period.

Keppel has a Health, Safety and 

Environment Policy, which all our 

employees and suppliers are 

expected to abide by. Despite our 

strong emphasis on safety, we 

suffered seven fatalities in 2016.  

We have investigated these incidents 

thoroughly and rigorously, and 

instituted measures to prevent 

recurrence.

Recognising the importance of 

integrating our sustainability 

principles across our supply chain,  

we put in place the Keppel Supplier 

Code of Conduct, which entered  

into effect in end 2016. The Code 

describes our expectations of those 

who intend to do business with us. 

Suppliers of Keppel Group companies 

are expected to abide by the Code,  

which covers areas pertaining to 

business conduct, environmental 

management, labour practices,  

as well as safety and health.

Keppel has been producing 

sustainability reports annually  

since 2010. Our reports draw  

on internationally-recognised 

frameworks of reporting, including 

the Global Reporting Initiative 

Standards.  In 2016, the Singapore 

Exchange (SGX) introduced 

sustainability reporting on a  

“comply or explain” basis for any 

financial year ending on or after  

31 December 2017. This report has 

been brought in line with the new  

SGX requirements, a year ahead  

of the deadline, and is externally 

audited in accordance with the 

AccountAbility AA1000 Assurance 

Standard 2008. All listed Keppel 

entities have also commenced 

sustainability reporting this year.

We are encouraged that our 

sustainability efforts have been 

recognised. Keppel was included 

among the top 10 constituents in all 

four sustainability indices launched 

by the SGX in 2016. We continued to 

be recognised in the Dow Jones 

Sustainability Index and the MSCI 

Global Sustainability Index as one  

of the most sustainable companies  

in our industry. Keppel Corporation 

also received the Singapore Apex 

Corporate Sustainability Award 2016 

in the Sustainable Business Category 

for Large Organisations. The award  

by Global Compact Network Singapore 

recognises firms that lead in 

sustainability. We will continue to 

refine our policies and practices,  

and identify opportunities to  

enhance our reporting approach.

We invest in partnerships that  

enrich educational opportunities, 

preserve our environment, improve 

the well-being of the underprivileged 

and support economic vitality. To help 

preserve biodiversity in Singapore’s 

urban landscape, Keppel committed 

$2.08 million to the establishment  

of the Keppel Discovery Wetlands. 

This freshwater forest wetland 

ecosystem is historically found in  

the vicinity of the Singapore Botanic 

Gardens, a UNESCO World Heritage 

Site. The restored 1.8 hectare 

wetlands was officially opened by  

the Prime Minister of Singapore  

on 31 March 2017, and provides 

opportunities for the public to 

experience and learn about a 

freshwater forest wetland habitat in 

the heart of the Singapore city centre.

Employee volunteerism complements 

and enriches our community 

investments. Keppel Volunteers,  

the Group’s volunteer movement, 

spearheads regular volunteer 

activities. In 2016, employees across 

the Group in Singapore achieved  

over 8,000 hours of community 

service, an increase of 3,000 hours 

over the 5,000 hours in 2015.

With an eye towards the future, we 

will continue to strive in collaborating 

with our stakeholders to contribute  

to the positive development of 

societies and in navigating this 

sustainability journey.

Keppel Corporation Limited  Sustainability Report 2016

Group Overview


Materiality with respect to sustainability 

reporting, as defined by GRI Standards, 

includes topics and indicators that  

reflect the organisation’s significant 

economic, environmental, and social 

impacts; and would substantively  

influence the assessments and decisions  

of stakeholders.

Process

A robust process was undertaken to 

identify and prioritise the Company’s 

material ESG issues. 

The process, which took place from  

2013 to 2015, was supported by an 

independent consultant and involved 

stakeholder consultations, workshops for 

senior management, an assessment of 

long-term global trends and an internal 

review of our businesses. The resulting 

Keppel Corporation Materiality Matrix 

illustrates the relative importance of  

the issues as seen by our stakeholders  

(see diagram).

In 2016, the material ESG issues for  

Keppel Corporation were reviewed at  

the annual Group Sustainability Working 

Committee meeting, where all eight 

working groups were present. The  

material ESG issues were further  

reviewed by the Steering Committee and 

Keppel Corporation’s Board of Directors 

and deemed to remain relevant.

Report Boundary

As a guide, this report covers global 

operations and all subsidiaries for which 

Our materiality assessments included 

stakeholder consultations, workshops 

for senior management and a review of 

long- term global trends.

the Group has management control,  

unless otherwise indicated. The reporting 

boundary for financial data is the  

same as that of Keppel Corporation’s 

Report to Shareholders 2016. The 

reporting boundaries for Environmental 

Performance, Product Excellence,  

Safety &amp; Health and Labour Practices &amp; 

Human Rights differ, due to differences  

in where the impacts occur most for each 

topic. Business entities included within 

the boundaries contribute materially to 

overall Group performance.

The Company has 243 significant 

subsidiaries and associated companies  

as at 31 December 2016. Information 

pertaining to them is published on pages 

173 to 181 of Keppel Corporation’s Report 

to Shareholders 2016.

In July 2016, we completed a significant 

restructuring exercise to consolidate  

our interests in the Group’s four asset 

management businesses, namely Keppel 

REIT Management, Alpha Investment 

Partners and Keppel Infrastructure Fund 

Management, as well as a 50% interest in 

Keppel DC REIT Management, under 

Keppel Capital. Keppel Capital will 

strengthen our capital recycling platform 

and provide a steady pillar of recurring 

income for the Group. It will also work 

closely with business units across the 

Keppel Group to expand our capital base 

with co-investors.

Keppel Corporation Limited  Sustainability Report 2016

Group Overview


Sustainable Development Goals

We welcome the introduction of the United Nations’ 

Sustainable Development Goals and believe that businesses 

play an important role in achieving these goals.

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals 

(SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development officially came into force on 

1 January 2016. The SDGs were adopted 

earlier by world leaders in September 

2015 at a historic United Nations (UN) 

Summit, and define global priorities  

and aspirations for 2030.

Keppel welcomes the introduction of the 

SDGs and believes that businesses can 

play an important role in the achievement 

of the goals by advancing sustainable 

development. We reviewed how our 

different businesses can contribute  

to each of the SDGs, and have, where 

appropriate, incorporated the goals as a 

supportive framework for our sustainability 

strategy. In this report, we share how we 

contribute towards eight of these goals 

through our business thrusts.

Building Sustainable Cities









As a multi-business group, Keppel offers 

compelling solutions to meet the world’s 

needs for sustainable urbanisation.  

Our different verticals provide solutions 

for energy, infrastructure, clean 

environments, high quality homes  

and offices, and connectivity. We aim  

to create long-term benefit for 

communities wherever we operate.

Energy use in buildings and for  

building construction represents more 

than one-third of global final energy 

consumption and contributes to nearly 

one-quarter of greenhouse gas (GHG) 

emissions worldwide1. A growing 

population means that energy demand  

in buildings could increase by 50%  

by 20502. The building sector offers 

significant and cost-effective GHG 

mitigation potential3.

As one of Asia’s premier property 

companies, Keppel Land is focused  

on developing properties that harmonise 

with the environment, and adopts a 

holistic and proactive approach towards 

environmental management.  

The company undertakes rigorous 

measures to ensure that both new and 

existing developments not only comply 

with, but exceed regulatory requirements, 

and are aligned with internationally-

recognised environmental guidelines.  

For all completed commercial buildings in 

Singapore, Keppel Land has achieved its 

goal of achieving at least the BCA Green 

Mark GoldPLUS standard. Keppel Land  

also aims for all its new developments 

overseas to attain at least the BCA Green 

Mark Gold certification or its equivalent.  

The company has garnered a total of 65 

BCA Green Mark Awards to date. 

Keppel Telecommunications &amp; 

Transportation continues to focus on 

energy efficiency and reliability in its  

data centre portfolio. Since 2015, all  

of the data centre facilities owned or 

managed by Keppel Data Centres in 

Singapore have been certified with the 

Singapore Standard for Green Data 

Centres – Energy and Environmental 

Management System. In the Logistics 

business, the company continues to 

harness technology, such as enhanced 

route planning, to optimise resources.

Keppel Capital, Keppel’s asset 

management arm, manages different 

asset classes, from energy and 

infrastructure to real estate. Keppel 

Capital seeks to conduct business 

responsibly, and this includes enhancing 

and improving the environmental 

performance of its property and 

infrastructure assets through the 

incorporation of green features  

where feasible.

The Keppel Group is also leading the 

Singapore Consortium in the development 

of the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City 

(Eco-City). This is a high-level project 

between the governments of Singapore 

and China to develop a sustainable city 

which can be a model for sustainable 

development in other Chinese cities.  

Now into its ninth year of development, 

the Eco-City has transformed from a 

barren, saline and alkaline site to an 

emerging green city, with over 70,000 

residents. The Eco-City is developed in 

accordance with a comprehensive set of 

Key Performance Indicators that cover 

various aspects of sustainability, including 

environmentally friendly buildings, green 

transportation, use of renewable energy, 

as well as social and economic factors.

Collaborating to Deliver Reliable  

Energy Solutions







Solutions in our energy portfolio focus on 

enhancing access to energy. 

Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine (Keppel O&amp;M)  

is strengthening its track record in 

providing comprehensive and innovative 

solutions in Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). 

LNG is considered to be one of the safest 

and cleanest fuels available, and  

offers significant potential for industries  

to reduce GHG emissions. For instance, 

Keppel O&amp;M has established a joint 

venture with Shell to supply LNG bunkering 

operations services in Singapore’s port, 

and has also signed a Memorandum  

of Understanding to jointly explore 

opportunities to cater to the demand for 

LNG as a fuel in coastal areas, inland 

waterways and the international marine 

sectors. In addition, Keppel Shipyard’s 

design and technology arm, Gas 

Technology Development (GTD) leads  

the push for new technologies in all 

aspects of LNG development. GTD brings 

together research and development 

capabilities as well as marine conversion 

and shipbuilding expertise to develop a  

suite of robust gas solutions. 

Since 2007, Keppel Merlimau Cogen Plant 

has been using natural gas to generate 

electricity. Gas-fired plants have 

significantly lower carbon emissions  

than oil-fired steam plants. 

In 2016, Keppel Land’s corporate office at 

Bugis Junction Towers became the first 

Green Mark-certified office to be fully 

powered by solar energy. The solar energy 

is purchased from Keppel Electric through 

an offsite solar purchase scheme.

Innovating Water &amp;  

Waste Management Technology









Keppel Infrastructure leverages the 

advanced technology solutions of its 

subsidiary, Keppel Seghers, to address  

a wide spectrum of environmental  

issues in solid waste and wastewater. 

With a strong track record in Europe, 

North and South America, Asia Pacific, 

Africa and the Middle East, Keppel is 

well-positioned to meet the challenges  

of building a cleaner world.

Waste-to-energy (WTE) plants by  

Keppel generate green energy from  

waste and help in landfill diversion by  

as much as 90% through reduction in  

the volume of waste disposed. We have 

implemented our proven and patented 

WTE technologies in more than 100 

state-of-the-art facilities around the 

world. In 2016, Keppel Seghers secured  

six contracts to provide WTE technology 

and services in China, including that  

from repeat customer Shenzhen Energy 

Environment Engineering Co for the  

Baoan WTE plant, which is slated to 

become the world’s largest WTE facility  

in terms of incineration capacity  

(see page 49).

Keppel’s advanced water solutions  

cover the full water cycle, including 

wastewater treatment, process and 

drinking water, desalination and water 

reuse. We have implemented more than 

350 water and wastewater treatment 

projects globally to date. Keppel has 

designed, built and is now operating  

two landmark projects that serve the 

environmental needs of Qatar – the Doha 

North Sewage Treatment Works, which 

recycles wastewater and treats sludge for 

agricultural reuse, and the Domestic Solid 

Waste Management Centre, which treats 

municipal waste to generate green energy.

Separately, in January 2017, Keppel 

Infrastructure was awarded a contract by 

PUB, Singapore’s national water agency,  

to Design, Build, Own and Operate the 

country’s fourth desalination plant.  

Upon completion in 2020, the plant will  

be the first in Singapore with the ability  

to treat sea water and fresh water. 

Valuing &amp; Supporting Our People





Our businesses spark economic growth, 

productivity and jobs. In 2016, Keppel’s 

businesses generated $7.3 billion in 

economic value. This includes revenue, 

interest and investment income, and 

disposal gains. Close to $1.2 billion was 

paid out in employee wages and benefits, 

and $223 million was paid to governments 

in the form of income taxes.

More than 20,000 people in over 20 

countries work at Keppel every day.  

They are supported by an inclusive  

culture that allows them to maximise  

their potential. Our hiring policies  

ensure equal employment opportunities 

for all (see pages 72 to 74). 

We are committed to nurture human 

capital, and make investments to  

equip our employees with up-to-date 

skills and certifications. We also  

partner with government bodies and 

educational institutions on initiatives 

targeted at grooming young talents  

(see pages 74 to 77).

Stakeholder Engagement



Close collaboration with our stakeholders 

supports us in addressing sustainability 

challenges. We regularly engage with  

and consult our diverse groups of 

stakeholders. Where appropriate  

and relevant to our businesses, we 

incorporate their feedback into our 

planning and actions.

Our stakeholder engagement framework 

is developed in accordance with the 

AA1000 AccountAbility Stakeholder 

Engagement Standard, whereby 

stakeholders are defined to be individuals, 

groups of individuals or organisations 

that affect and/or could be affected by 

Keppel’s activities, products or services 

and associated performance.

The feedback arising from our 

stakeholder engagements, which 

includes inputs on our sustainability 

reporting and materiality, has helped  

us strengthen the relevance of our 

reporting and approach to managing 

Keppel Corporation’s material issues.

Stakeholder relations, including 

engagement with employees, customers,  

shareholders, governments and  

local communities, are managed by 

departments at the corporate level,  

as well as by functional divisions and 

volunteer committees across our 

business units worldwide.

Human Resources departments across the 

Group implement employee engagement 

initiatives, while Group Legal and Group 

Corporate Communications departments 

lead initiatives to engage shareholders and 

the investment community.

The commercial and procurement teams  

of our business units, as well as our Group 

Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) teams, 

coordinate efforts to engage our suppliers 

on compliance and HSE-related issues.

Keppel Volunteers, the Group’s volunteer 

arm, engages non-profit organisations and 

organises regular community outreach 

activities to make a positive difference in 

the communities where we operate.

Managing Our Supply Chain

Our Supply Chain

The Keppel Group contracts local and 

foreign suppliers for our different lines  

of businesses, and we work closely with 

our suppliers to make a positive impact  

on their sustainability performance.

At our Offshore &amp; Marine business,  

our subcontractors work jointly with  

us to construct, convert and repair  

offshore and marine vessels in our yards. 

Equipment manufacturers supply us with 

large-scale equipment such as offshore 

drilling equipment, thrusters and winches 

for installation on the rigs and offshore 

service vessels that we build for clients.  

In addition, we also procure cranes and 

panel line systems, as well as process 

equipment such as generators, cryogenic 

systems, switchgears and variable  

control systems. We also work with bulk 

material suppliers dealing in fuel, which 

includes petrol, diesel, furnace oil and 

Liquefied Petroleum Gas, as well as  

steel plates, steel profiles, cables,  

piping, grit and paint.

Our Property business engages 

consultants, contractors, and interior 

design firms to provide architectural and 

engineering design, construction and 

interior design services for our real estate 

developments.  

As a manager of real estate properties,  

we also employ facility management 

companies to service our commercial  

buildings.

Our Infrastructure business engages 

subcontractors to provide Engineering, 

Procurement and Construction services  

in the construction of our plants and  

data centres. We also purchase raw 

materials, such as feedstock, to power  

the co-generation plant for our Gas-to-

Power business. In addition, we procure 

goods and services for the operations  

and maintenance of our plants.

In our Logistics business, subcontractors  

are engaged for transportation services, 

warehouse operations and facility 

maintenance. In our Data Centres business, 

external facility technicians are engaged 

for equipment maintenance regularly.

In our Investment business, our managers 

engage subcontractors to ensure smooth 

operations and maintenance of our assets. 

The supply chain for this business also 

comprises mechanical and electrical 

equipment suppliers for some of our data 

centres, as well as facility management 

companies that provide physical security, 

technical maintenance and routine  

cleaning services.

We work closely with stakeholders in 

our supply chain to positively influence 

their performance.

Management

We adhere to local content requirements 

and are committed towards strengthening 

our base of local suppliers in countries 

where we operate. In doing so, we support 

domestic economic growth, generate 

employment opportunities and improve 

the capacities of the workforces in our  

host countries.

We established the Supplier Code of 

Conduct at the end of 2016 to integrate 

Keppel’s sustainability principles across 

our supply chain as well as to positively 

influence the environmental, social  

and governance performance of our  

suppliers. Suppliers of the Keppel Group  

of companies are expected to abide  

by the Code, which covers areas 

pertaining to business conduct,  

labour practices, safety and health,  

and environmental management.

In addition, third-party associates of  

the Group that provide services or  

engage in business activities on behalf  

of a Group company are required to abide 

by Keppel’s Rules of Business Conduct.  

The rules specify the Group’s policy  

with regard to ethical conduct and 

compliance with laws, anti-corruption, 

gifts and hospitality, and donations  

and contributions.



We work closely with 

our suppliers to make 

a positive impact on 

their sustainability 

performance.

Keppel Corporation Limited  Sustainability Report 2016

Group Overview




Suppliers are expected 

to abide by the Supplier 

Code of Conduct, which 

covers areas pertaining 

to business conduct, 

labour practices, 

safety and health, 

and environmental 

management.

As a large, global company with businesses 

in more than 20 countries, we value a 

secure, efficient and flexible supply chain.

In general, in qualifying new key suppliers  

before awarding them any business, we 

ensure that new suppliers have security 

practices in place that meet or exceed 

established requirements. We also focus  

on maintaining flexibility in our supply  

chains so as to ensure sufficient resources 

and effective capabilities.

New suppliers are screened and qualified  

in accordance with our requisition and 

purchasing policies.

We review potential suppliers’ industry 

reputation, track records, Health,  

Safety and Environment (HSE) and  

labour criteria as well as certifications  

in key sustainability areas. For example, 

contractors with certifications for ISO 9001 

Quality Management System, ISO 14001 

Environmental Management System and 

OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health &amp; Safety 

Management System or equivalent 

certifications are preferred.

Upon selection, new suppliers are assessed 

again by the respective work teams based 

on specified criteria. All subcontractors are 

required to abide by the relevant laws and 

regulations during the course of engagement. 

The feedback provided by the work teams to 

the procurement teams helps to determine 

whether new suppliers are included in our 

approved supplier list. Annual reviews of 

suppliers are also conducted to evaluate 

suppliers’ performance to ensure 

satisfactory service quality and  

HSE standards.

We also actively influence our supply 

chain by working closely with our 

subcontractors to ensure that they  

are aligned with our HSE standards.

As a participant of the Marine 

Sponsorship Scheme by Singapore’s 

Ministry of Manpower (MOM), Keppel 

Offshore &amp; Marine is obliged to ensure 

that its appointed resident contractors 

adhere to MOM guidelines for the 

employment of both local and  

foreign employees.

Keppel Land has in place a five-step 

supply chain management process  

that covers the whole life-cycle of its 

project from its initiation and design 

development stages to subsequent 

construction and operation stages.  

For all project sites covered under the 

scope of Keppel Land’s environmental 

management system, contractors  

are required to conduct an impact 

assessment based on activities at  

the project site prior to construction.  

The assessment covers potential 

negative environmental impacts, 

including depletion of resources, 

biodiversity disturbance as well as air, 

water and noise pollution. Contractors 

are required to establish and implement 

appropriate measures to mitigate and/or 

prevent significant environmental  

impacts identified.

Our Supplier Code of Conduct aims to 

integrate our sustainability principles 

across our supply chain and positively 

influence the environmental, social  

and governance performance of  

our suppliers.

Overview

An estimated 54.5% of the world’s 

population lived in urban settlements  

in 2016. According to estimates by  

the United Nations, urban areas are 

projected to house 60% of people globally 

by 2030, and one in every three people  

will live in cities with at least half a  

million inhabitants1.

Managing urban areas has become  

one of the most important development 

challenges of the 21st century. If well 

managed, cities offer important 

opportunities for economic development 

and for expanding access to basic 

services, including healthcare and 

education, for large numbers of people. 

Providing public transportation, as  

well as housing, electricity, water and 

sanitation for a densely settled urban 

population is typically cheaper and  

less environmentally damaging than 

providing a similar level of services to  

a dispersed rural population.

The rapid pace of urbanisation generates 

significant pressure on infrastructure  

and the delivery of services, potentially 

overwhelms housing and transport 

systems, and increases issues around 

urban pollution. Addressing sustainable 

development challenges is therefore an 

ever more urgent priority.

Management Approach

Keppel has a distinct blend of competencies 

to provide solutions for sustainable 

urbanisation. The Group is actively 

seeking opportunities for growth in  

this area, through meeting the growing 

demand for energy, high quality homes 

and offices, clean urban environments, 

good infrastructure and connectivity.

We aim to be a global best-in-class 

company at the forefront of our chosen 

industries. Over the year, we have made 

several strategic moves to grow Keppel 

sustainably. We have simplified our 

corporate structure and sharpened our 

business model. We are working our 

capital harder to seek the best possible 

returns, fostering innovation and 

collaboration, and harnessing synergies 

across the Group’s businesses.

Against a challenging backdrop,  

Keppel Corporation performed creditably, 

demonstrating that with strong financial 

discipline, the Company can capture 

sustainable returns for its stakeholders.

The full ownership of Keppel Land, 

following the completion of its  

Selective Capital Reduction exercise,  

has strengthened our ability to capture 

opportunities, recycle capital and  

allocate resources across the Group  

for optimal returns.

In July 2016, we completed a significant 

restructuring exercise to consolidate our 

interests in the Group’s asset management 

businesses under Keppel Capital. This 

includes 100% interests in Keppel REIT 

Management, Alpha Investment  

Partners and Keppel Infrastructure Fund 

Management, as well as a 50% interest  

in Keppel DC REIT Management.

Economic Sustainability

The creation of Keppel Capital is a 

significant component in our business 

model. With total assets under 

management of $25 billion, Keppel Capital 

will strengthen our capital recycling 

platform and provide a steady pillar  

of recurring income for the Group.  

It will also work closely with the Group’s 

other business units to expand our  

capital base with co-investors, thus 

allowing us to seize opportunities for 

growth without putting a strain on our 

balance sheet.

Another product of collaboration,  

the newly-launched Alpha Data Centre  

Fund, demonstrates how we can harness 

strengths among different business  

units. Alpha manages the fund and  

works with Keppel Telecommunications &amp; 

Transportation (Keppel T&amp;T) to create or 

acquire assets. Meanwhile, Keppel Data 

Centres Holding, a 70-30 joint venture 

between Keppel T&amp;T and Keppel Land,  

will develop and project-manage the  

data centres in the fund, as well as  

serve as the facility manager.

Financial Performance in 2016

Group net profit was $784 million for  

2016, down 49% from $1,525 million  

for 2015. This was due largely to lower 

contributions from the Offshore &amp;  

Marine business, additional provisions  

for impairment of $336 million, mainly 

arising from the rightsizing of Keppel 

Offshore &amp; Marine and impairments  

of investments and stocks &amp; 

work-in-progress.

Earnings Per Share was 43.2 cents  

for 2016, down 49% from 84.0 cents  

for 2015. Return on Equity was 6.9%, 

compared to 14.2% in the previous year. 

Economic Value Added was negative  

$140 million for 2016, compared to  

$648 million for 2015.

In 2016, cash inflow was $576 million, 

compared to cash outflow of $694 million  

in the previous year. Meanwhile, net gearing 

for 2016 was 0.56 times.

Total cash dividend for 2016 is 20.0 cents 

per share. This comprises a final cash 

dividend of 12.0 cents per share and the 

interim cash dividend of 8.0 cents per share 

distributed in the third quarter of 2016.

Government Assistance &amp; Taxes Paid

In 2016, the Group received a total of  

$6.1 million in financial assistance from 

governments. This largely consisted  

of Research and Development grants as 

well as a cash grant by the Singapore 

government’s Jobs Credit scheme.

between shareholders, the Board and 

management. The Chairman takes a 

leading role in the Company’s drive to 

achieve and maintain a high standard  

of corporate governance with the full 

support of the directors, Company 

Secretaries and management.

To assist the Board in the discharge of  

its oversight function, various board 

committees, namely the Audit, Board Risk, 

Nominating, Remuneration, and Board 

Safety Committees, have been constituted 

with clear written terms of reference.  

All board committees are actively engaged 

and play an important role in ensuring good 

corporate governance in the Company  

and within the Group. 

The CEO, assisted by the management 

team, makes strategic proposals to the 

Board and after robust and constructive 

board discussion, executes the agreed 

strategy, manages and develops the 

Group’s businesses and implements the 

Board’s decisions. He is supported by 

management committees that direct  

and guide management on operational 

policies and activities, which include:

(1) Investments &amp; Major Projects Action 

Committee (IMPAC), which evaluates, 

guides and optimises proposed Group 

investments and divestments 

exceeding prescribed value thresholds; 

(2) Management Development Committee, 

which nominates candidates as nominee 

directors to the boards of each unlisted 

company or entity that the Company is 

invested in (“Investee Company”) so as 

to safeguard the Company’s investment. 

In respect of Investee Companies that 

are (a) listed on a stock exchange,  

(b) managers or trustee-managers of 

any collective investment schemes, 

business trusts or any other trusts 

which are listed on a stock exchange,  

or (c) parent companies of the Company’s 

core businesses, the Committee will 

recommend the candidates for the 

approval of the Nominating Committee 

(“NC”);

(3) Central Finance Committee, which 

reviews, guides and monitors financial 

policies and activities of Group 

companies; 

(4) Enterprise Risk Management 

Committee, which drives and 

coordinates the Group’s risk 

management efforts, and implements 

the Enterprise Risk Management 

framework and processes; 

(5) Group RCMC, which articulates the 

Group’s commitment to regulatory 

compliance, directs and supports  

the development of overarching 

compliance policies and guidelines, 

and facilitates the implementation  

and sharing of policies and procedures 

across the Group1; 

(6) Group RCWT, which supports the Group 

RCMC and oversees the development 

and review of overarching compliance 

policies and guidelines for the Group, 

as well as reviewing training and 

communication programmes1;

(7) Keppel IT Steering Committee, which 

provides strategic information 

technology (IT) leadership and ensures 

IT strategy alignment in achieving 

business strategies; and

(8) Group Sustainability Steering 

Committee, which sets the 

sustainability strategy and leads 

performance in key focus areas.

Board Strategic Review

The Board periodically reviews and 

approves the Group’s strategic plans. In the 

financial year ended 31 December 2014 

(“FY 2014”), the Board approved the Group’s 

Vision 20202 which sets out the vision, 

operating principles and values of the 

Group, and the roadmap3 to take the 

Group’s businesses into 2020 to achieve 

faster growth, build a stronger Keppel that 

fully captures the significant synergies 

within and among its Group companies, 

and fully develop the potential of its people.

Review Process 

A process is in place to support the Board 

in reviewing and monitoring the Group’s 

strategic plans, including providing 

directors with the necessary context and 

opportunity to undertake effective and 

robust deliberation and debate. In this 

regard, a two-day off-site board strategy 

meeting is organised annually for in-depth 

discussion on strategic issues and 

direction of the Group. This is followed  

by an update of each business unit’s 

strategic plans for alignment with the 

Group’s strategy. To support the Board’s 

oversight of the implementation of the 

strategic plans, one business unit is 

invited to each quarterly Board meeting  

to present on its plans and current 

challenges and provide the Board an 

opportunity to perform an in-depth review 

into each of the Group’s core businesses.

Independence of Directors

There is a strong and independent 

element on our Board, with an 

independent chairman and majority of our 

Board comprising independent directors. 

Except for the Board Safety Committee, 

all board committees are comprised 

entirely of independent or non-executive 

directors, with independent chairmen. 

The independence of the directors is 

reviewed by the NC on an annual basis, 

bearing in mind the 2012 Code’s definition 

of an “independent director” and guidance 

as to relationships the existence of  

which would deem a director not to be 

independent. Such reviews are based on 

each director’s self-declaration in the 

Director’s Independence Checklist and  

his/her actual performance on the Board  

and board committees. 

Independent Judgment

All directors are expected to exercise 

independent judgment in the best 

interests of the Company. This is one of 

the performance criteria for the peer and 

self-assessment on the effectiveness  

of the individual directors. Based on the 

results of the peer and self-assessment 

carried out by the directors for FY 2016,  

all directors have discharged this duty 

consistently well.

Conflict of Interest

Every director is required to declare any 

conflict of interest in a transaction or 

proposed transaction with the Company 

as soon as is practicable after the relevant 

facts have come to his/her knowledge.  

On an annual basis, each director is also 

required to submit details of his/her 

associates for the purpose of monitoring 

interested persons transactions.

2 With effect from FY2014, the vision of the Company is to be a global company at the forefront of its chosen industries, shaping the future for the benefit of all its 

stakeholders – Sustaining Growth, Empowering Lives and Nurturing Communities. Guided by its operating principles and core values, the Company’s mission is  

to execute its business in Offshore &amp; Marine, Property, Infrastructure and Investments profitably, safely and responsibly.

3 This roadmap includes four broad areas for sustainable growth: (1) Business: Setting the overarching strategies, targets, and key actions to be undertaken by 

the business units; (2) People: Building a robust succession pipeline and continued strong employee satisfaction; (3) Process: Pursuing excellence in safety, 

productivity and innovation; and (4) Corporate Citizenry: Formalising and further organising community outreach efforts to positively impact communities in  

which the Group operates.

Keppel Corporation Limited  Sustainability Report 2016

Sustaining Growth


An Effective Board

Our Board fully understands that they 

must act in the best interest of the 

Company at all times, are accountable  

to the shareholders and have the 

responsibility to safeguard the interests  

of all shareholders. In this aspect, the 

Board and management fully appreciate 

that fundamental to good corporate 

governance is an effective and robust 

Board whose members engage in open 

and constructive debate and challenge 

management on its assumptions  

and proposals.

Board Information

To effectively engage the management, 

the Board, in particular, the non-executive 

directors, must be kept well informed of 

the Company’s business and affairs and 

be knowledgeable about the industry  

in which the businesses operate. The 

Company has therefore adopted initiatives 

to put in place processes to ensure that 

the non-executive directors are well 

supported by accurate, complete and 

timely information, have unrestricted 

access to management, and have 

sufficient time and resources to discharge 

their oversight function effectively. 

These initiatives include regular informal 

meetings for management to brief the 

directors on prospective deals and 

potential developments at an early stage 

before formal board approval is sought, 

and the circulation of relevant information 

on business initiatives, industry 

developments and analyst and press 

commentaries on matters in relation to 

the Company or the industries in which  

it operates. A two-day off-site board 

strategy meeting is organised annually for 

in-depth discussion on strategic issues 

and direction of the Group, to give  

the non-executive directors a better 

understanding of the Group and its 

businesses and to provide an opportunity 

for the non-executive directors to 

familiarise themselves with the 

management team so as to facilitate  

the Board’s review of the Group’s 

succession planning and leadership 

development programme.  

Board Competency &amp; Diversity 

The competencies and skillsets of  

the directors and the composition of  

the Board play a role in the overall 

effectiveness of the Board. At Keppel,  

the NC ensures that the Board and board 

committees comprise directors who,  

as a group, provide core competencies 

required to exercise effective oversight 

and direction. 

For FY 2016, the NC is satisfied that  

the Board and the board committees 

comprise directors, who as a group, provide 

an appropriate balance and diversity of 

skills, experience, gender, knowledge of 

the Group, core competencies such as 

accounting or finance, business or 

management experience, human 

resource, risk management, technology, 

mergers and acquisitions, legal, 

international perspective, industry 

knowledge, strategic planning experience 

and customer-based experience or 

knowledge, required for the Board and  

the board committees to be effective. 

In this respect, the NC recognises the 

merits of gender diversity in relation to  

the composition of the Board and, in 

identifying suitable candidates for new 

appointment to the Board, would ensure 

that female candidates are included for 

consideration. Having said that, gender  

is but one aspect of diversity and new 

directors will continue to be selected 

based on objective criteria set as part  

of the process for appointment of new 

directors and Board succession planning. 

In FY 2016, there was one female director 

out of a total of nine directors. 

Board Evaluation

Our Board has in place formal processes 

for assessing the effectiveness of the 

Board as a whole and of its board 

committees, the contribution by each 

individual director to the effectiveness  

of the Board as well as the effectiveness 

of the Chairman of the Board. To ensure 

that the assessments are done promptly 

and fairly, the Board has appointed an 

independent third party coordinator  

to assist in collating and analysing the 

returns of the Board members. Such 

assessments help to improve the overall 

effectiveness of the Board by providing 

opportunities for the directors to give 

constructive feedback and helping them 

to focus on their key responsibilities. 

Training

The directors are provided with continuing 

education in areas such as directors’ 

duties and responsibilities, corporate 

governance, changes in financial reporting 

standards, changes in the Companies  

Act, continuing listing obligations and 

industry-related matters, so as to update 

and refresh them on matters that may 

affect or enhance their performance as 

board or board committee members.  

A training programme is also in place for 

directors in areas such as accounting, 

finance, risk governance and management, 

the roles and responsibilities of a director 

of a listed company and industry-specific 



Keppel’s Board Safety 

Committee regularly 

conducts site visits to

overseas.

Corporate Governance

matters. Site visits are also conducted 

periodically for directors to familiarise 

them with the operations of the various 

businesses so as to enhance their 

performance as board or board 

committee members. 

Board Composition &amp; Succession 

Planning 

There is a process of refreshing the  

Board progressively over time so that  

the experience of longer serving directors 

can be drawn upon while tapping into  

new external perspectives and insights  

of more recent appointees. The Board 

believes that orderly succession and 

renewal is achieved as a result of  

detailed planning, where the appropriate 

composition of the Board is continually 

under review.

Appointment &amp; Re-appointment  

of Directors 

The NC is responsible for reviewing the 

succession plans for the Board, and has 

put in place a formal process for the 

renewal of the Board and the selection of 

new directors. The NC leads the process 

and makes recommendations to the 

Board as follows:

(1) NC annually reviews the balance and 

diversity of skills, experience, gender 

and knowledge required by the Board 

and the size of the Board which would 

facilitate decision-making. 

(2) In light of such reviews and in 

consultation with management,  

the NC assesses if there is any 

inadequate representation in respect 

of any of those attributes and if so, 

determines the role and the desirable 

competencies for a particular 

appointment. 

(3) External help (e.g. Singapore Institute 

of Directors, search consultants, open 

advertisement) may be used to source 

for potential candidates if need be. 

Directors and management may also 

make recommendations.

(4) NC meets with the shortlisted 

candidate(s) to assess suitability and 

to ensure that the candidate(s) is/are 

aware of the expectations and the level 

of commitment required.

(5) NC makes recommendations to the 

Board for approval.

All new appointments are subject to the 

recommendation of the NC based on the 

following objective criteria:

(1) Integrity

(2) Independent mindedness

(3) Diversity – Possess core competencies 

that meet the needs of the Company 

and complement the skills and 

competencies of the existing directors 

on the Board

(4) Ability to commit time and effort to 

carry out duties and responsibilities 

effectively

(5) Track record of making good decisions

(6) Experience in high-performing 

companies

(7) Financial literacy

The NC is also responsible for re-nomination 

having regard to the director’s contribution 

and performance (such as attendance, 

preparedness, participation and candour), 

with reference to the results of the 

assessment of performance of the 

individual director by his/her peers.

The directors submit themselves for 

re-nomination and re-election at regular 

intervals of at least once every three years. 

Pursuant to the Company’s constitution, 

one-third of the directors retire from office 

at the Company’s annual general meeting, 

and a newly appointed director must 

submit himself/herself for re-election at 

the annual general meeting immediately 

following his/her appointment.

Remuneration Framework

The Remuneration Committee (“RC”) assists 

the Board to ensure that remuneration 

policies and practices are sound in that 

they are able to attract, retain and motivate 

without being excessive, and thereby 

maximise shareholder value. 

The RC recommends to the Board for 

endorsement a framework of remuneration 

and the specific remuneration packages 

for each director and key management 

personnel. The RC also reviews the 

remuneration of senior management and 

administers the KCL Share Option Scheme 

in respect of the outstanding options 

granted prior to the termination of the  

KCL Share Option Scheme at end-2010,  

the KCL Restricted Share Plan (the “KCL 

RSP”) and the KCL Performance Share 

Plan (the “KCL PSP”). 

To enhance objectivity, the RC comprises 

entirely non-executive directors, three out 

of four of whom (including the Chairman) 

are independent.  

The RC has access to expert advice from 

external remuneration consultants where 

required. In FY 2016, the RC sought views 

on market practice and trends from 

external remuneration consultants, Aon 

Hewitt. The RC undertook a review of the 

independence and objectivity of the 

external remuneration consultants through 

discussions with the external remuneration 

consultants, and has confirmed that the 

external remuneration consultants had  

no relationships with the Company  

which would affect their independence  

and objectivity.

Executive Director &amp; other Key 

Management Personnel

The Company advocates a performance-

based remuneration system that is highly 

flexible and responsive to the market, 

Company’s, business unit’s and individual 

employee’s performance.

In designing the compensation structure, 

the RC seeks to ensure that the level  

and mix of remuneration is competitive, 

relevant and appropriate in finding a 

balance between current versus long-term 

compensation, and between cash versus 

equity incentive compensation. The total 

remuneration mix comprises three  

key components: annual fixed cash,  

annual performance incentive, and the  

KCL Share Plans. The annual fixed cash 

component comprises the annual basic 

salary plus any other fixed allowances 

which the Company benchmarks with the 

relevant industry market median. The 

annual performance incentive is tied to the 

Company’s, business unit’s and individual 

employee’s performance, inclusive of a 

portion which is tied to Economic Value 

Added (EVA) performance. The KCL Share 

Plans are in the form of two share plans 

approved by shareholders, the KCL RSP 

and the KCL PSP. The EVA performance 

incentive plan and the KCL Share Plans are 

long-term incentive plans. Executives who 

have a greater ability to influence Group 

outcomes have a greater proportion of 

overall reward at risk. 

The RC exercises broad discretion and 

independent judgment in ensuring that  

the amount and mix of compensation are 

aligned with the interests of shareholders 

and promote the long-term success of the 

Company. The mix of fixed and variable 

reward is considered appropriate for  

the Group and for each individual role. 

The compensation structure is directly 

linked to corporate and individual 

performance, both in terms of financial, 

non-financial performance and the 

creation of shareholder wealth. This  

link is achieved in the following ways:

(1) by placing a significant portion of 

executives’ remuneration at risk  

(“At Risk component”) and in some 

cases, subject to a vesting schedule; 

(2) by incorporating appropriate key 

performance indicators (“KPIs”) for 

awarding of annual cash incentives:

32

Keppel Corporation Limited  Sustainability Report 2016

Sustaining Growth


a. There are four scorecard areas that 

the Company has identified as key 

to measuring the performance of 

the Group – (i) Financial; (ii) Process;  

(iii) Stakeholders; and (iv) People. 

Some of the key sub-targets within 

each of the scorecard areas include 

key financial indicators, safety goals, 

risk management and controls 

measures, corporate social 

responsibility activities, employee 

engagement, talent development 

and succession plan;

b. The four scorecards areas have 

been chosen because they support 

how the Group achieves its strategic 

objectives. The framework provides 

a link for staff to understand how 

they contribute to each area of  

the scorecard, and therefore to  

the Company’s overall strategic 

goals. This is designed to achieve  

a consistent approach and 

understanding across the Group;

(3) by selecting performance conditions 

such as Return on Equity, Total 

Shareholder Return and EVA for  

equity awards that are aligned with 

shareholder interests; 

(4) by requiring those KPIs or conditions  

to be met in order for the At Risk 

components of remuneration to be 

awarded or to vest; and

(5) by forfeiting the At Risk components  

of remuneration when those KPIs or 

conditions are not met at a  

satisfactory level.

The RC also recognises the need for a 

reasonable alignment between risk and 

remuneration to discourage excessive  

risk taking. Therefore, in determining the 

compensation structure, the RC had taken 

into account the risk policies and risk 

tolerance of the Group as well as the  

time horizon of risks, and incorporated 

risk-adjustments into the compensation 

structure through several initiatives, 

including but not limited to:

(1) prudent funding of annual cash 

incentives; 

(2) bonus deferrals under the EVA 

performance incentive plan;

(3) vesting of contingent share awards 

under the KCL Share Plans being 

subject to KPIs and/or performance 

conditions being met; and

(4) potential forfeiture of variable incentives 

in any year due to misconduct.

The RC is of the view that the overall  

level of remuneration is not considered  

to be at a level which is likely to promote 

behaviours contrary to the Group’s  

risk profile.

In determining the actual quantum of 

variable component of remuneration,  

the RC had taken into account the extent 

to which the performance conditions  

have been met. The RC is therefore of  

the view that remuneration is aligned to 

performance during FY 2016.

In order to align the interests of the 

executive director and key management 

personnel with that of shareholders, the 

executive director and key management 

personnel are remunerated partially in  

the form of shares in the Company and  

are encouraged to hold such shares  

while they remain in the employment  

of the Company.

The directors, the CEO and the key 

management personnel (who are not 

directors or the CEO) are remunerated  

on an earned basis and there are no 

termination, retirement and post-

employment benefits that are granted 

over and above what has been disclosed.

Non-Executive Directors

Each of the non-executive directors 

(including the Chairman) will receive 70% 

of his/her total directors’ fees in cash and 

30% in the form of KCL shares (“Remuneration 

Shares”) (both amounts subject to 

adjustment as described below). 

The actual number of Remuneration 

Shares, to be purchased from the market 

on the first trading day immediately  

after the date of the Annual General 

Meeting (“Trading Day”) for delivery to  

the respective non-executive directors, 

will be based on the market price of the 

Company’s shares on the Singapore 

Exchange Securities Trading Limited  

(the “SGX”) on the Trading Day.

The actual number of Remuneration 

Shares will be rounded down to the 

nearest thousand and any residual 

balance will be paid in cash. Such 

incorporation of an equity component  

in the total remuneration of the non-

executive directors is intended to achieve 

the objective of aligning the interests of 

the non-executive directors with those  

of the shareholders’ and the long-term 

interests of the Company.

In FY 2016, the Group undertook several 

rightsizing measures (in particular the 

offshore and marine business) to stay 

ahead in the tough operating environment. 

In light of the continued uncertainties 

looming over the offshore and marine 

industry, KCL directors, key management 

personnel and the Group’s senior 

management took a further step and 

collectively volunteered for a fee and  

base pay reduction respectively. Besides 

exemplifying solidarity across the Group, 

this also signalled the importance of 

maintaining a flexible cost structure. 

The aggregate directors’ fees for  

non-executive directors is subject to 

shareholders’ approval at each annual 

general meeting.

Please refer to pages 70 to 74 of the 

Company’s Report to Shareholders  

2016 for details on the remuneration 

framework. 

Risk Management &amp; Internal Controls

The Board, supported by the Audit 

Committee (“AC”) and Board Risk 

Committee (“BRC”), oversees the Group’s 

system of internal controls and risk 

management. 

The AC’s primary role is to assist the Board 

in ensuring the integrity of financial 

reporting and providing assurance that 

there is a sound system of internal controls 

in place. It is supported by Group Internal 



Stakeholder engagement 

is a key performance 

indicator in the 

Company’s scorecard. 

The investment 

community is a key 

stakeholder, and is 

regularly engaged 

through site visits. 

33


Corporate Governance

Audit, which provides independent 

assurance to the AC to ensure that the 

Company maintains a sound system of 

internal controls by regular monitoring  

of key controls and procedures and 

ensuring their effectiveness, undertaking 

investigations as directed by the AC,  

and conducting regular in-depth audits  

of high risk areas. In this aspect, Group 

Internal Audit conducts regular reviews  

of the adequacy and effectiveness of  

the Group’s material internal controls, 

including financial, operational, 

compliance and information technology 

controls. Any material non-compliance  

or failures in internal controls and 

recommendations for improvements  

are reported to the AC. 

The BRC reviews and guides management 

in the formulation of risk policies and 

processes to effectively identify, evaluate 

and manage significant risks to safeguard 

shareholders’ interests and the Group’s 

assets. The Committee reports to the 

Board on critical risk issues, material 

matters, findings and recommendations 

in respect of significant risk matters, and 

on an annual basis, the adequacy and 

effectiveness of the risk management 

system including financial, operational, 

compliance and information technology 

controls. In this aspect, the Group is 

guided by a set of Risk Tolerance Guiding 

Principles, as disclosed on page 36 of  

this report. The Group also has a Risk 

Management Assessment Framework 

which was established to facilitate the 

Board’s assessment on the adequacy  

and effectiveness of the Group’s risk 

management system. The framework 

spells out the governing policies, 

processes and systems pertaining to  

each of the key risk areas of the Group, 

and assessments are made on the 

adequacy and effectiveness of the 

Group’s risk management system in 

managing each of these key risk areas. 

System of Management  

Controls Framework

Keppel’s System of Management Controls 

Framework (the “Framework”) outlines  

the Group’s internal control and risk 

management processes and procedures. 

The Framework comprises three Lines of 

Defence towards ensuring the adequacy 

and effectiveness of the Group’s system  

of internal controls and risk management

Under the first Line of Defence, 

management is required to ensure  

good corporate governance through the 

implementation and management of 

policies and procedures relevant to the 

Group’s business scope and environment. 

Such policies and procedures govern 

financial, operational, information 

technology and regulatory compliance 

matters and are reviewed and updated 

periodically. Compliance governance is 

governed by the respective regulatory 

compliance management committees  

and working teams chaired by business 

owners. Employees are also guided by 

the Group’s Core Values and expected to 

comply strictly with the Employee Code  

of Conduct. 

Under the second Line of Defence, 

significant business units are required to 

conduct a self-assessment exercise on 

an annual basis. This exercise requires 

such business units to assess the status 

of their respective internal controls and 

risk management via self-assessment. 

Where required, action plans are 

developed to remedy identified control 

gaps. Under the Group’s Enterprise Risk 

Management Framework, significant 

risks areas of the Group are also 

identified and assessed, with systems, 

policies and processes put in place to 

manage and mitigate the identified risks. 

Regulatory Compliance supports and 

works alongside business management 

to ensure relevant policies, processes 

and controls are effectively designed, 

managed and implemented to ensure 

compliance risks and controls are 

effectively managed.

Under the third Line of Defence, to assist 

the Group to ascertain the adequacy  

and effectiveness of the Group’s internal 

controls, business units are required  

to provide the Group with written 

assurances as to the adequacy and 

effectiveness of their systems of internal 

controls and risk management. Such 

assurances are also sought from the

Internal Policies

The Group has communicated a 

comprehensive set of policies to 

employees as part of its commitment  

to maintaining a robust system of risk 

management and internal controls. 

These policies are disseminated via email 

and accessible to employees. As and 

when there are updates to the policies, 

the updated policies are broadcasted 

and disseminated Group-wide.

Code of Conduct

The Keppel Group considers it important 

that all employees understand the  

rules of conduct for which they are 

accountable, in accordance with the 

laws and regulations of all the countries 

in which the Group operates, and our 

own Group policies. There must be a 

strong commitment to practise good 

business ethics across the Group and 

Keppel employees must always act  

with the highest integrity, guided by  

the Keppel Core Values. 

As part of the Group’s commitment  

to strengthen regulatory compliance,  

the Keppel Regulatory Compliance 

Governance Structure was developed  

in FY 2015, and key components of the 

structure such as the Group RCMC and 

Group RCWT were operationalised in  

FY 2016.

(1) Employee Code of Conduct

 

The Company’s Employee Code of 

Conduct sets out the principles of 

business conduct expected of all 

directors, officers and employees.  

It provides the Group’s anti-bribery 

stance and position on gifts and 

hospitality, facilitation payments  

and dealings with associates, and 

requires all employees and officers  

of the Group to avoid any conflict 

between their interests and  

interests of the Group in dealing  

with suppliers, customers and  

other third parties.

 

To set the tone from the top, the 

Company periodically disseminates 

Group-wide Keppel Group Anti-

Bribery and Corruption Statements, 

endorsed by KCL CEO, to emphasise 

the Group’s long-standing policy to 

conduct business with integrity, in an 

ethical and proper manner, and in 

compliance with applicable laws and 

regulations, and require all employees 

to comply with the Code and its values 

and apply them in all aspects of 

day-to-day work.

 

The Employee Code of Conduct was 

included as part of the mandatory 

annual e-training and assessment 

covering key policies. As part of the 

same exercise, approximately 6,500 

directors, officers and employees 

acknowledged that they had read and 

understood the Employee Code of 

Conduct including declaration of any 

potential conflict of interest. All new 

employees are also provided a copy  

of the Employee Code of Conduct and 

are required to acknowledge their 

understanding of its content. 

 

Training seminars on the Employee 

Code of Conduct are also conducted 

regularly. For FY 2016, training courses 

were conducted for over 700 employees 

from selected business units to guide 

the employees in the implementation of 

the rules and procedures within the 

Code including emphasis on the Group’s 

zero tolerance stance against any form 

of illegal activity, including bribery  

and corruption involving its employees 

or associates. 

 

 

Employees are encouraged to seek 

clarification and guidance if they are 

unclear on how any aspect of the Code 

of Conduct applies to their jobs or a 

particular matter, or the legality or 

integrity of a particular course of action. 

Employees who violate the Code of 

Conduct may face disciplinary action, 

including suspension or termination  

of employment.  

(2) Supplier Code of Conduct

 

In FY 2016, the Company also 

established the Supplier Code of 

Conduct to integrate Keppel’s 

sustainability principles across its 

supply chain, and positively influence 

the environmental, social and 

governance performance of its 

suppliers. Suppliers of the Keppel 

Group of companies are expected to 

abide by the Supplier Code of Conduct, 

which covers areas pertaining to 

business conduct, labour practices, 

safety and health, and environmental 

management.

Other Policies

The Company also has various policies 

including Insider Trading, Competition  

Law and Personal Data Protection to  

govern practices of the Group and ensure 

awareness and compliance with relevant 

laws and regulations. Business units also 

have their respective operational policies 

and standard operating procedures, 

including approval limits for financial 

commitments and procurement policies,  

to mitigate risks of fraud.

Reporting &amp; Investigation

The Keppel Whistle-Blower Protection 

Policy has been in place since  

1 September 2004 to encourage  

reporting in good faith of suspected 

reportable conduct by establishing clearly 

defined processes through which such 

reports may be made with confidence  

that employees and other persons  

making such reports will be treated  

fairly and, to the extent possible, 

protected from reprisal. 

Reportable conduct refers to any act or 

omission by an employee of the Group or 

contract worker appointed by a company 

within the Group, which occurred in the 

course of his/her work (whether or not  

the act is within the scope of his/her 

employment) which in the view of a 

Whistle-Blower acting in good faith, is:

(1) dishonest, including but not limited  

to theft or misuse of resources within 

the Group;

(2) fraudulent;

(3) corrupt;

(4) illegal;

(5) other serious improper conduct; 

(6) an unsafe work practice; or

(7) any other conduct which may cause 

financial or non-financial loss to  

the Group or damage to the Group’s 

reputation.

The AC reviewed the policy and was 

satisfied that arrangements are in place 

for the independent investigation of such 

matters and for appropriate follow-up 

action. To facilitate the management of 

incidences of alleged fraud or other 

misconduct, the AC is guided by a set of 

guidelines to ensure proper conduct of 

investigations and appropriate closure 

actions following completion of the 

investigations, including administrative, 

disciplinary, civil and/or criminal actions, 

and remediation of control weaknesses 

that perpetrated the fraud or misconduct 

so as to prevent a recurrence.

investigation mechanism under the 

Keppel Whistle-Blower Protection Policy,

Risk Management



As part of the Group’s 

business continuity 

measures, exercises 

such as flu pandemic 

simulations are 

carried out.

Notwithstanding the headwinds, we 

continued a disciplined pursuit of new 

opportunities and revenue streams to 

safeguard shareholders’ interests and the 

Group’s assets. Supported by a robust risk 

management system, we are able to 

respond effectively to shifting business 

demands and seize opportunities that 

create value for our stakeholders.

Robust Enterprise Risk  

Management Framework

Keppel’s Board is responsible for 

governing risks and ensuring that 

management maintains a sound system 

of risk management and internal controls. 

Assisted by the Board Risk Committee 

(BRC), the Board provides valuable advice 

to management in formulating the risk 

management framework, policies and 

guidelines. Our management surfaces  

key risk issues for discussion with the  

BRC and the Board regularly.

The terms of reference for the BRC are 

disclosed on page 79 of the Company’s 

Report to Shareholders 2016.

The Board has put in place three Risk 

Tolerance Guiding Principles for the Group. 

These Principles serve to determine the 

nature and extent of the significant risks, 

which our Board is willing to take in 

achieving its strategic objectives.

These principles are:

1) Risk taken should be carefully 

evaluated, commensurate with rewards 

and in line with the Group’s core 

strengths and strategic objectives. 

2) No risk arising from a single area of 

operation, investment or undertaking 

should be so huge as to endanger the 

entire Group. 

3) The Group does not condone safety 

breaches or lapses, non-compliance 

with laws and regulations, as well as 

acts such as fraud, bribery and 

corruption.

Our risk governance framework is set out 

on pages 75 to 77 under Principle 11 (Risk 

Management and Internal Controls) of the 

Company’s Report to Shareholders 2016. 

This framework facilitates management 

and the BRC in determining the adequacy 

and effectiveness of the Group’s risk 

management system. Risk management 

is an integral part of decision-making 

across the Group. We recognise the 

dynamic environment in which the Group 

operates, and we continue to refine the 

framework where necessary, to ensure 

strong governance across the Group.

Keppel’s Enterprise Risk Management 

(ERM) framework, a component of 

Keppel’s System of Management Controls, 

provides the Group with a holistic and 

systematic approach to risk management. 

It outlines the reporting structure, 

monitoring mechanisms, processes  

and tools, as well as policies and limits,  

in addressing the Group’s key risks.

Our ERM framework is constantly refined, 

ensuring relevance in a dynamic operating 

environment. References are made to the 

Singapore Code of Corporate Governance, 

ISO 31000, ISO 22313 and the Guidebook 

for Audit Committees.

A Risk and Compliance Committee, 

comprising relevant subject matter 

champions across the business units, 

drives and coordinates Group-wide 

initiatives. We keep abreast of the latest 

developments and best practices by 

participating in industry seminars and 

interacting with risk management 

practitioners.

As a Group, we adopt a balanced approach 

to risk management. As not all risks can  

be eliminated, we will only undertake 

appropriate and well-considered risks to 

optimise returns for the Group.

Strategic Risk

Market &amp; Competition

The Group’s strategic risks comprise 

market and competition risks. These 

We adopt a balanced approach to risk 

management, undertaking only appropriate 

risks to optimise returns.

36

Keppel Corporation Limited  Sustainability Report 2016

Sustaining Growth


include market driven forces, evolving 

competitive landscape, changing 

customer demands and disruptive 

innovation. The Group remains vulnerable 

to a number of external factors including 

uncertainties in the global economy, 

implications from geopolitical 

developments on globalisation and 

threats of disruptive technology. These 

risks receive constant high-level 

attention throughout the year. We hold 

strategy meetings to review business 

strategies, formulate responses and take 

pre-emptive action against these risks.

The BRC guides the Group in formulating 

and reviewing risk policies and limits. 

These are subject to periodic reviews to 

ensure they continue to support business 

objectives and are aligned to our risk 

tolerance level. Taking into consideration 

the prevailing business climate and the 

Group’s risk appetite, the policies aim to 

address risks effectively and proactively.

Investments &amp; Divestments 

We have an established process for 

evaluating investment and divestment 

decisions. Investments are monitored to 

ensure they are on track in meeting the 

Group’s strategic intent, investment 

objectives and returns. These investment 

decisions are guided by investment 

parameters set on a Group-wide basis. 

Together with the Board, the Investment 

&amp; Major Projects Action Committee 

(IMPAC) guides the Group to take 

thoughtful risks in a controlled manner, 

exercising the spirit of enterprise as well 

as financial discipline to earn the best 

risk-adjusted returns on invested capital.

Investment risk assessment involves 

rigorous due diligence, feasibility  

studies and sensitivity analyses of  

key assumptions and variables. Some 

factors considered in the assessment 

include alignment to Group strategy, 

financial viability, country-specific 

political and regulatory developments, 

contractual risk implications as well as 

lessons learned. The investment  

portfolio is constantly monitored to 

ensure that performance is on track to 

meet the Group’s strategic intent and 

investment returns.

Human Resources 

We maintain a significant emphasis on 

attracting and building a talent pool.  

This includes nurturing employees, 

maintaining good industrial relations  

and fostering a conducive work 

environment. The Group continues to 

focus on strengthening succession 

planning and bench strength.

We recognise the importance of having  

a risk-centric mindset and the ability to 

identify, assess, develop and implement 

mitigation actions, as well as monitor 

risks. Keppel Leadership Institute, 

established as a global centre to equip 

leaders with the capabilities to drive 

Keppel’s growth, helps to inculcate this 

mindset by embedding risk management 

in its key leadership courses.

Operational Risk 

Project Management 

From the stage of initiation through  

to completion, risk management 

processes are integrated within project 

management to facilitate early risk 

detection and proactive management.  

The Group adopts a systematic 

assessment and monitoring process  

to help manage the key risks for each 

project. Particular attention is given to 

technically challenging and high-value 

projects, including greenfield 

developments, as well as those that 

involve new technology or operations  

in a new country. Projects are managed in 

accordance to the respective country’s 

environmental laws and labour practices.

At the project execution stage, we carry 

out project reviews and quality assurance 

programmes to address issues involving 

cost, schedule and quality. Project Key 

Risk Indicators are used as early  

warning signals. In addition, we conduct 

knowledge-sharing workshops to share 

best practices and lessons learnt across 

the Group. All these help to ensure that 

projects are completed on time and 

within budget, while meeting safety  

and quality standards, as well as 

contract obligations.

 

Health, Safety &amp; Environment

Maintaining a high level of health, safety 

and environment (HSE) standards is  

of paramount importance to the Group. 

As such, we are constantly raising 

awareness and building a HSE culture at 

the ground level. Key initiatives include 

driving a zero fatality strategy with a 

roadmap focused on aligning Hazard 

Identification Risk Assessment 

standards across our global operations, 

enhancing competency of employees 

performing safety-critical tasks, 

strengthening operational controls,  

as well as developing more proactive  

and leading matrices to monitor  

HSE performance. Environmental 

management practices in key operating 

sites are also closely monitored. As a 

Group, we continue to embrace and 

leverage technology to improve HSE 

processes and systems.

Our robust risk management system 

allows us to respond effectively to 

shifting business demands and seize 

opportunities for value creation.

37


Risk Management

Business &amp; Operational Processes 

Through ongoing efforts to streamline 

business processes, we have established 

a common shared services platform 

which allows us to achieve cost savings, 

improve efficiency and productivity, as 

well as enhance governance, compliance 

and control.

We adopted ISO standards and 

certifications to achieve standardisation 

of processes and best practices. In 

addition, procedures relating to defect 

management, operations, project control 

and supply chain management were 

established to improve quality of 

deliverables. We conduct regular reviews 

of policies and authority limits to ensure 

that they remain relevant in meeting 

changing business requirements.

Business Continuity

We are committed to enhancing 

operational resilience through a robust 

Business Continuity Management (BCM) 

Plan that will equip us to respond 

effectively to disruptions, while continuing 

with critical business functions and 

minimising the impact on our people, 

operations and assets. As a Group, we  

are cognisant of the increasing threat of 

terrorism and have increased efforts in 

reviewing and testing our operational 

preparedness and effectiveness of these 

plans. Follow up actions are taken to 

strengthen operational resilience and  

key learning points are documented.

Crisis management and communication 

procedures have also been embedded 

into the Group’s BCM processes. These 

procedures are constantly refined to allow 

us to respond in an orderly and coordinated 

way, as well as to expedite recovery. Our 

focus is on building capabilities to respond 

to crises effectively while safeguarding  

our people, assets and the interests of  

our stakeholders.

Information Technology

The Group has in place an Information 

Technology (IT) security framework to 

address evolving IT security threats such 

as hacking, malware, mobile threats  

and loss of data.

Our IT security, governance and control 

have been strengthened through the 

alignment of IT policies, processes and 

systems, and the consolidation of servers 

and storages. We have also appointed  

IT security officers and implemented 

guided self-assessment to identify IT 

security gaps.

Extensive training, including assessment 

exercises, have been conducted on user 

security education to heighten awareness 

of IT threats. Measures and considerations 

have also been taken to safeguard against 

loss of information, data security, and 

prolonged service disruption of critical  

IT systems.

Compliance Risk 

Laws, Regulations &amp; Compliance 

Given the geographical diversity of  

our businesses, we closely monitor 

developments in laws and regulations  

in countries where the Group operates,  

to ensure that our businesses and 

operations comply with all relevant laws 

and regulations. We regularly engage  

with local government authorities and 

agencies to keep abreast of changes  

in regulations.

Recognising that non-compliance with 

laws and regulations has potential 

significant reputational and financial 

impact, particular emphasis is placed on 

regulatory compliance in all our operations. 

More details on areas taken by the Group 

in operationalising regulatory compliance 

are set out on page 95 of the Company’s 

Report to Shareholders 2016.

Financial Risk

Fraud, Misstatement of Financial 

Statements &amp; Disclosures 

We continue to maintain a strong 

emphasis on ensuring financial 

statements are accurate and presented 

fairly in accordance with applicable 

financial reporting standards and 

framework. Where appropriate, we 

leverage the expertise of the engaged 

auditors in the interpretation of financial 

reporting standards and changes.  

Regular external and internal audits are 

conducted to provide assurance on 

accuracy of financial statements and 

adequacy of the control framework 

supporting the statements. We hold 

regular training and education 

programmes to enhance competency  

of finance managers across the Group. 

Furthermore, Control Awareness 

workgroups are organised to share and 

strengthen knowledge, to improve the 



As part of continuous 

efforts to foster a 

compliance-centric 

culture, regular 

compliance trainings 

and workshops are 

carried out across the 

Group, in Singapore 

and overseas.

Shareholders 2016.

Financial Management 

Financial risk management relates to our 

ability to meet financial obligations and 

mitigate credit, liquidity, currency and 

interest rate risks. Policies and financial 

authority limits are reviewed regularly to 

incorporate changes in the operating and 

control environment.

At Keppel, we are focused on financial 

discipline, deploying our capital to earn 

the best risk-adjusted returns and 

maintaining a strong balance sheet to 

seize opportunities. This includes the 

evaluation of counterparties against 

pre-established guidelines.

For more details on the Group’s financial 

risk management, please refer to pages 

56 and 57 of the Company’s Report to 

Shareholders 2016.

Impact assessment and stress tests  

are performed to gauge the Group’s 

exposure to changing market situations, 

allowing for informed decision-making and 

implementation of prompt mitigating 

actions. We also regularly monitor the 

concentration of exposure in the  

countries where the Group operates.

Risk-Centric Culture

Effective risk management hinges not only 

on systems and processes, but also on 

mindsets and attitudes. The Group fosters a 

risk-centric culture through four key areas.

1. Leadership 

Our management is committed to fostering 

a strong risk-centric culture, showing 

strong support for risk management 

initiatives. Key messages encouraging 

prudent risk-taking in decision-making  

and business processes are interwoven 

into major meetings, speeches and 

publications.

2. Risk Management Process

An integral aspect of strategic and budget 

reviews includes investment and project 

planning risk management at all levels  

of the businesses. As part of the process, 

appropriate tools and risk management 

methodology are applied.

3. Training &amp; Communication

Workshops are conducted regularly to 

enhance risk management competency 

across the Group. Through various forums 

and in-house publications, training and 

communication programmes are also 

carried out to reinforce discipline and 

garner greater awareness.

4. Performance Evaluation

We seek to raise the accountability of  

our employees for risk management 

through the performance evaluation 

process. A Group-wide survey is 

conducted periodically to assess the level 

of risk awareness amongst employees.

Proactive Risk Management 

We remain vigilant against emerging 

threats that may affect our different 

businesses. Through close collaboration 

with stakeholders, we will continue to 

review our risk management system  

to ensure that it remains adequate  

and effective.

Overview

The proactive management of our 

environmental impact enables us to 

improve resource efficiency, reduce  

costs and support the global climate 

change agenda.

This environmental performance  

report includes data from the Group’s 

major subsidiaries in Singapore  

and overseas operations in which  

the Group has significant ownership.  

This includes Keppel O&amp;M and its 

significant subsidiaries – Keppel FELS, 

Keppel Shipyard and Keppel Singmarine,  

Keppel Land, Keppel Infrastructure, 

Keppel Telecommunications &amp; 

Transportation (Keppel T&amp;T) and  

Keppel Capital. 

We have been progressively expanding  

the scope of our reporting to cover all 

major entities in the Group. The scope  

of our reporting in 2016 was expanded  

to include data from City Gas, the sole 

producer and retailer of town gas in 

Singapore. The inclusion of City Gas  

has resulted in a significant increase in 

direct energy consumption and direct 

carbon emissions reported.

Due to commercial sensitivity, direct 

energy consumption and carbon 

emissions arising from Keppel 

Infrastructure’s power generation 

operations are excluded from this report.

Management Approach

The Group’s risk and sustainability-based 

strategies are used to assess, avoid, 

reduce and mitigate environmental risks 

and impacts. We continue to focus our 

efforts on addressing material topics, 

which include enhancing energy efficiency, 

managing water and waste, as well as 

reducing our carbon emissions.

Singapore ratified the Paris Agreement  

on climate change in September 2016  

and affirmed its support and commitment 

for climate action. The Singapore 

government had earlier released its 

Climate Action Plan in July 2016, which 

outlined the various measures to reduce 

its greenhouse gas emissions and 

enhance resilience to climate change.

In support of the global agenda on  

climate change, we have set a target  

of achieving a 16% improvement  

in carbon emissions from 2020  

business-as-usual levels. We seek to 

adopt more efficient and sustainable 

processes, invest in green technology  

and include more eco-friendly features  

in our products.

Environmental Performance

Most of our key business units are 

certified to ISO 14001 standards and other 

certifications including the International 

Sustainability Rating System and the 

Singapore Standard for National Green 

Data Centre Management System, 

demonstrating commitment towards 

environmental protection. The rigs and 

ships we build comply with all six annexes 

of the International Convention for the 

Prevention of Pollution from Ships 

(MARPOL 73/78) which is the main 

international convention covering 

prevention of pollution of the marine 

environment by ships.

Carbon management receives oversight 

by the Group’s Energy Efficiency Committee, 

which is chaired by Cindy Lim, Director of 

Group Corporate Development, Keppel 

Corporation. The committee sets targets, 

reviews effective implementation of 

carbon management efforts, and 

monitors and reports on performance.  

It comprises representatives from the 

respective business units, many of whom 

are certified energy managers.

Separately, to improve the coordination  

of energy efficiency initiatives across  

our shipyards, the Keppel O&amp;M Energy 

Programme Office was set up in March 

2016. The Energy Programme Office 

focuses on diesel management, gas 

management and electricity management.

Building Sustainable Cities

The Group considers environmental 

factors during the planning and design of 

our property developments, data centres 

and warehouses as well as during the 

operation phases.

In 2016, two of Keppel Land’s overseas 

developments, namely International 

Financial Centre Jakarta Tower Two in 

Indonesia and Sedona Hotel Yangon in 

Myanmar, were certified to the Building &amp; 

Construction Authority of Singapore (BCA) 

Green Mark Platinum and BCA Green 

Mark GoldPLUS standards respectively. 

Keppel Land also encourages tenants to 

adopt environmental certifications such 

as the BCA Green Mark for Office Interior 

scheme and the Singapore Environment 

Council’s Eco-Office label.

Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City

The Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City 

(Eco-City) is on track to realising its vision 

of becoming a model for sustainable 

urbanisation since breaking ground more 

than eight years ago. The master developer 

for the project is Sino-Singapore Tianjin 

Eco-City Investment and Development 

Co., Ltd. (SSTEC), a 50-50 joint venture 

between a Singapore Consortium led by 

the Keppel Group and a Chinese Consortium 

led by Tianjin TEDA Investment Holding 

Co., Ltd. To date, there are over 70,000 

people working and living in the Eco-City 

and over 4,700 registered companies2.

This flagship bilateral project between  

the governments of China and Singapore 

has been lauded for its eco-friendly 

features, such as its wide green belts, 

green transport, renewable energy, green 

buildings, ‘sponge city’ development as 

well as waste reduction and recycling 

initiatives. 

The Eco-City has received numerous 

accolades, including being named China’s 

first National Green Development

significant portion of energy consumption 

in data centres goes towards keeping 

temperatures and humidity at low levels. 

By being able to function optimally at 

higher temperatures and humidity levels, 

Tropical Data Centres could reduce  

energy consumption by up to 40%.

Protecting Biodiversity

Keppel Land’s premier waterfront 

development, Corals at Keppel Bay, is 

home to a thriving kaleidoscope of coral 

reefs and marine life due to the company’s 

efforts to conserve biodiversity. Corals at 

the historic King’s Dock at Keppel Bay are 

being transplanted to enhance the existing 

habitat for marine life. This initiative is  

the first by a private developer.

Energy

The Group’s energy demand comprises  

a mix of direct and indirect sources of 

energy. Direct energy refers to primary 

sources of energy consumed on site  

by our operations, whereas indirect 

energy is electricity purchased from 

external suppliers.

The Group’s primary energy source is 

diesel. Other direct sources of energy  

are petrol, furnace oil and Liquefied 

Petroleum Gas.

In 2016, the Group consumed 7,394,690 

gigajoules (GJ) of direct energy and 

1,820,611 GJ of indirect energy or 

electricity, compared to 1,061,515 GJ  

of direct energy and 1,985,171 GJ of 

indirect energy in 2015.

Our Singapore operations consumed 

7,166,393 GJ of direct energy and 

1,595,838 GJ of indirect energy in 2016, 

compared to 738,935 GJ of direct energy 

and 1,592,299 GJ of indirect energy in 

20153. The significant increase in direct 

energy was due to the inclusion of direct 

energy consumption from City Gas. 

Excluding contributions from City Gas,  

the direct energy consumption of  

the Group was 617,754 GJ, of which  

389,456 GJ was consumed by our 

Singapore operations.

Environmental Performance

Improving Energy Efficiency

The Group is estimated to have saved 

519,026 GJ4 of energy from its energy 

efficiency initiatives in 2016 and from 

Keppel Land’s Green Mark developments. 

The total energy saved is equivalent to 

nearly 5.6% of the Group’s total energy 

consumption in 2016, and translates  

to estimated cost savings of about  

$27 million5 and avoidance of 

approximately 62,000 tonnes of  

carbon dioxide (t-CO2) emissions6.

These savings were achieved through the 

optimisation of operations and processes; 

technological improvements, including 

the adoption of more sustainable building 

designs and materials; and the use of 

energy-efficient equipment and devices.

Examples of initiatives in 2016 are:

– Electric cables were rerouted to 

transmit electricity via a power grid 

instead of the less-efficient diesel 

generator at Keppel FELS’ yards7.

− Variable speed drives were installed  

to run ballast pumps8 and ventilation 

blowers9 at Keppel Shipyard as part  

of energy efficiency upgrades.

Energy savings are achieved through 

optimising operations and processes; 

adopting sustainable building designs 

and materials, and using energy-

efficient equipment.

− Welding machines were modified at 

Keppel Singmarine to include idle 

control systems, which automatically 

shut down idle machines to reduce 

electricity consumption10.

− Fan blades were upgraded and 

secondary pump systems were 

optimised across several of Keppel 

DHCS’ district cooling plants11.

− At Keppel Data Centres, two Diesel 

Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply 

(DRUPS) systems have been  

deployed to ensure high-quality  

and continuous power supply12. 

Additionally, two units of chilled water 

cooling systems13 and more sensor 

lightings14 have been installed to 

improve energy efficiency. 

Harnessing Renewables

The Group strives to decrease reliance  

on fossil fuels and increase its use of 

renewable sources of energy.

In 2016, Keppel Land’s corporate office  

at Bugis Junction Towers became the first 

Green Mark-certified office to be fully 

powered by solar energy. The solar energy 

is purchased from Keppel Electric. In this 

offsite solar purchase scheme, renewable 

energy is harvested from photovoltaic 

panels installed in premises operated by 

Keppel Infrastructure, and transferred  

to Keppel Land. With this new initiative, 

Keppel Land is expected to offset about 

150 t-CO2 emissions6 every year. 

Water

Water is a precious resource. The Group 

continues to strengthen its water 

conservation efforts through initiatives  

like promoting water-saving practices, 

adopting water-efficient technologies  

4 The 519,026 GJ in savings comprise savings from the reduced usage of fossil fuels, such as diesel, and a reduction in electricity consumed. The amount of  

savings in absolute terms is the difference in consumption before and after the implementation of an energy efficiency project. The savings are converted to energy 

equivalent in Gigajoules (GJ) based on the corresponding energy conversion factors for fossil fuels and electricity published in the United Kingdom’s Department  

for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) 2015 Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting, whereby 1kWh = 0.0036 GJ and 1 tonne  

of diesel = 43.33 GJ.

5 The electricity conversion factor used is based on the United Kingdom’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) 2015 Government GHG 

Conversion Factors for Company Reporting, whereby 1kWh = 0.0036 GJ. Estimated monetary savings are calculated based on the average electricity tariff rates  

in 2016 as published by Singapore Power, whereby 1kWh = $0.1890.

6 The electricity savings in carbon dioxide equivalent was estimated by multiplying the energy savings in kWh with the Electricity Grid Emission Factor  

(1 kWh = 0.4322 kg CO2) published by Singapore’s Energy Market Authority.

7 Savings calculated based on a reduction of 27,888 litres of diesel, which translates to 72.65 t-CO2 saved.

8 Savings calculated based on the installation of variable speed drives for three units of ballast pumps, operating 150 days per year, with savings of 125 kW per unit.

9 Savings calculated based on the installation of 50 ventilation blowers, operating 200 days per year, with savings of 2 kW per unit.

10 Savings calculated based on the modification of three welding machines, operating 360 days per year, with savings of 2 kWh per unit.

11 Upgraded fan blades and secondary pump systems estimated to yield savings of 153,653 kWh and 129,476 kWh respectively.

12 Savings calculated based on the installation of 2 DRUPS systems, which runs at a system efficiency of 97% as compared to conventional Uninterruptible Power 

Supply systems which runs at a system efficiency of 93%. Estimated savings from this is 738,887 kWh/year.

13 Savings calculated based on the installation of two units of chilled water cooling systems, with savings of 821,100 kWh per year, per unit.

14 The sensor lightings are expected to save 4,800 kWh/year.

and equipment as well as implementing 

process improvements.

The total water consumption of the Group 

consists of potable water (water from  

local catchment and imported water), 

NEWater (treated wastewater from 

sewage), recycled water and water  

drawn from rivers.

In 2016, the Group consumed 5,499,136 

cubic metres (m3) of water, a slight  

increase from 5,239,542 m3 in 2015.

Our operations in Singapore consumed 

4,031,622 m3 of water (potable and 

NEWater) compared to 3,742,386 m3 

in 2015. The increase in water  

consumption was mainly due to  

activities at Keppel Shipyard and the 

inclusion of City Gas data.

Enhancing Water Efficiency

The Automatic Blowdown Control  

System installed in Phase 2 of Keppel 

Infrastructure’s Keppel Merlimau Cogen 

Plant measures water chemistry and 

computes the precise amount of water  

that should be discarded to maintain the 

quality of water used by the steam turbines 

to generate steam, which in turn minimises 

water losses, yields operating cost savings 

and improves operational efficiency.  

Since its implementation in 2015, water 

consumption decreased from 767 m3 

per day to 131 m3 per day, registering a 

significant reduction of 82.9%.

Other water saving initiatives include 

installing water-efficient equipment and 

devices, encouraging good water usage 

habits as well as improving leakage 

inspection and response times.

Keppel Corporation Limited  Sustainability Report 2016

Sustaining Growth


The Senoko WTE Plant 

effluent filtration 

system reduces the 

amount of NEWater 

consumed at the plant 

during dry spells.

Measures to conserve water at Keppel 

Land’s buildings include the use of 

water-efficient fittings approved under 

the PUB Water Efficiency Labelling 

Scheme, self-closing taps and flow 

regulators. Keppel DC Singapore 1 and 2 

were certified to the SS 577 Water 

Efficiency Management System in  

2015 and 2016 respectively with the 

implementation of a Water Efficiency 

policy and procedures to manage  

water usage.

Water Recycling

In 2016, Keppel Seghers completed  

a substantial part of the Doha North 

Sewage Treatment Works project in  

Qatar and handed over the wastewater  

and sludge treatment facilities in the 

project to Ashgal, the Public Works 

Authority. The facility is able to treat  

up to an average flow of 245,000 m3 of 

wastewater a day, which will be used for 

non-potable purposes, thus freeing up 

Doha’s precious drinking water supply  

(see page 48).

At Keppel FELS, scrap materials from the 

yard are reused to build passages that 

channel rainwater from rooftop gutters  

and drains to a tank for gas hose testing.

During the dry season, treated effluent 

water from the refuse leachate and waste 

water at Keppel Infrastructure’s Senoko 

Waste-to-Energy (WTE) Plant is further 

treated to be used for ash quenching  

and fire prevention by wetting dry refuse 

in the bunker, reducing the demand  

for NEWater.

The Group recycled a total of 294,361 m3 

of water in 2016, which is equivalent to 

approximately 5.4% of the Group’s  

total water consumption. This is a  

344% increase from 66,278 m3 of water  

recycled in 2015. The increase was  

largely attributed to the optimisation  

of the effluent filtration system at  

Senoko WTE Plant.

Waste

The Group strives to minimise waste 

generation, increase opportunities  

for reusing and recycling, as well as  

treat and dispose of waste responsibly 

where other options are not practicable. 

Scrap metals are collected at our 

shipyards and WTE plants for recycling 

while used papers are collected and 

recycled across the Group’s businesses. 

The Group organises campaigns  

and shares educational resources  

to promote a culture of recycling  

among employees.

In 2016, the Group recycled 297,137 

tonnes (t) of refuse, which is a 39.9% 

increase from 212,255 t of waste in 2015. 

This increase is largely attributed to  

more scrap metals being recycled at 

Keppel FELS’ overseas yards. Waste 

recycled included ferrous scrap, grits, 

plastic stretch wrap, paper and other 

office consumables. Our Singapore 

operations recycled 47,263 t of waste  

in 2016, a significant 71.9% decrease 

from the previous year. The decrease  

is attributed to the shifting of some of 

Keppel O&amp;M’s activities in Singapore  

to overseas yards.

As a Group, a total of 27,948 t of waste 

was sent for incineration in 2016, 

registering a 16.9% decrease compared 

to 33,636 t in 2015.

Environmental Performance

In land-scarce Singapore, refuse is 

incinerated to reduce the volume  

of waste and to remove harmful 

substances before disposal at the 

landfill. A total of 27,929 t of waste  

was sent for incineration in 2016, 

registering a 16.7% decrease  

compared to 33,556 t in 2015.

The Senoko WTE and Keppel Seghers 

Tuas WTE Plants, which are running at 

contracted capacities of 2,310 t/day  

and 800 t/day respectively, are capable  

of processing more than 1.2 million t  

of municipal solid waste per year, and in 

the process supply up to 550 gigawatt 

hours of green energy to the grid.  

This helps in landfill diversion by as  

much as 90% through reductions in  

the volume of waste disposed, thus 

contributing to an avoidance of  

methane emissions from landfills.

As incineration of refuse is prohibited  

or unavailable in some countries where  

Keppel O&amp;M operates, a total of 3,815 t  

of municipal waste was disposed at 

landfill sites in 2016, a significant drop 

from 91,676 t of waste that was landfilled 

in 2015. The decrease in landfilled waste 

was largely due to a reduction in yard 

activities overseas.

There were no reports of spillages,  

and no sanctions pertaining to spillages 

that were administered by Singapore  

or overseas authorities on the Group  

in 2016.

Carbon Emissions15

In 2016, the Group’s total direct 

emissions from the use of fuels across 

the Group and the incineration of waste 

at WTE plants amounted to 1,205,749 

t-CO2, an increase from 687,128 t-CO2 

in 2015, while indirect emissions from 

electricity use was 224,146 t-CO2, a 

decrease from 233,127 t-CO2 in 2015.

Direct emissions for Singapore  

operations increased by 368,391 t-CO2, 

from 663,557 t-CO2 to 1,031,948 t-CO2 

in 2016. The increase in direct emissions 

for both the Group and Singapore 

operations is mainly due to the inclusion 

of Scope 1 emissions from City Gas, 

which contributed 358,129 t-CO2.

Indirect emissions from our Singapore 

operations increased by 9.1% from 

175,165 t-CO2 in 2015  to 191,189 t-CO2 

in 2016, again largely due to the inclusion 

of City Gas emissions.

Other Emissions &amp; Effluents

Keppel Infrastructure continues to 

actively manage the emissions from its 

operations. Nitrogen oxides and sulphur 

dioxide emitted from the three plants 

under Keppel Infrastructure remain  

far below the emission standards of  

700 milligrams per normal cubic metre  

(mg/Nm3) and 500 mg/Nm3 respectively, 

as stipulated by Singapore’s National 

Environment Agency (NEA) Code of 

Practice on Pollution Control.

15 The GHG conversion factors used for Scope1 

(direct emissions) are based on the United 

Kingdom’s Department for Environment, Food 

and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) 2015 Government 

GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting. 

The GHG conversion factors for Scope 2 (indirect 

emissions) are based on the “Electricity Grid 

Emission Factor” for 2016 from the Energy 

Market Authority. The GHG emission Scopes 1, 2  

and 3 are defined by the GHG Protocol, whereby 

Scope 1 refers to emissions from company owned 

and operated facilities, machines, vehicles, etc.; 

Scope 2 refers to emissions from the generation 

of purchased electricity consumed by the 

company; Scope 3 emissions are a consequence 

of the activities of the company, but occur from 

sources not owned or controlled by the company, 

such as employee commuting, business travel 

and the purchase of office supplies. The Group 

does not report on Scope 3 emissions as the 

boundaries for such emissions are very broad, 

and it is presently not feasible to track such  

data for a credible Scope 3 assessment.

10.75 mg/Nm3 and 12.04 mg/Nm3 

respectively, which were well below  

the NEA emission standard of  

100 mg/Nm3. Variations in emissions  

are dependent on the type of  

municipal refuse incinerated by  

the plants.

All trade effluent from our operations  

are treated and discharged to  

water courses or sewer systems in  

accordance with the environmental 

discharge limits and effluent standards  

in the countries of operation.

Compliance

During the year, two property 

developments in Singapore were fined  

a total of $67,400 for two incidences  

of mosquito breeding. Another property 

development was fined $5,000 for  

noise levels over NEA’s approved  

limit. These fines were imposed  

on Keppel Land’s appointed main  

contractor, and mitigating actions  

have been taken to prevent recurrence  

of similar incidents.

Keppel Infrastructure Trust’s  

Senoko WTE Plant was issued fines

Recycled water 

from the Doha 

North Sewage 

Treatment Works 

has transformed 

the surrounding 

landscape into a  

lush oasis in the 

middle of the desert.

Who would have dreamed it would be possible  

to build a nature sanctuary in the middle of a 

desert? Keppel has turned this dream into  

reality in a country where it hardly ever rains and 

temperatures soar above 40 degrees Celsius.

As part of Qatar’s vision for sustainable 

development, Keppel Seghers, a wholly-owned 

subsidiary of Keppel Infrastructure, was  

awarded the contract for the Doha North Sewage 

Treatment Works (DNSTW) project by Ashghal,  

the Public Works Authority, in 2007.  

Keppel was to design and build a wastewater 

treatment, water reuse and sludge treatment 

facility to serve the entire country, and 

subsequently operate and maintain this facility 

for 10 years. The contract is worth QR3.6 billion 

(S$1.5 billion). The plant became operational in 

December 2015, and in July 2016, Keppel  

handed over the solids stream and sludge 

treatment facilities to the client. 

Ong Tiong Guan, CEO of Keppel Infrastructure, 

remarked, “This project embodies the bold  

vision of the Qatari government to overcome 

environmental constraints through the use of 

modern technology, creating more liveable and 

sustainable spaces. Keppel is happy to have 

played a significant role in supporting Qatar’s 

vision for sustainable development.”

The facility, spanning 16 square kilometres (km2), 

is the first wastewater treatment facility in  

Qatar to feature membrane technology. The  

plant is able to treat up to an average flow of 

245,000 cubic metres of wastewater a day using 

advanced membrane and ultra-violet treatment 

technologies. Treated to international standards, 

the high-grade reclaimed water is used for 

non-potable purposes, thus freeing up Doha’s 

precious drinking water supply. The plant also 

employs a comprehensive odour control system 

to minimise the impact on the surrounding 

environment.

As part of the project, Keppel is also developing 

an 8.3 km2 green buffer zone – a sanctuary  

for migratory birds amid vast desert sands, 

which is set for completion in 2017. Envisioned  

as a public recreational park, about 95,000  

trees are being planted to create this nature 

sanctuary. The reclaimed water is used to  

irrigate the green buffer zone, while the 

processed sludge is used as organic  

fertiliser or in landscaping projects.

Keppel supports Qatar’s vision for sustainable development 

with the Doha North Sewage Treatment Works.

Special Focus



Keppel’s WTE 

technology and 

services contribute 

to landfill diversion 

and reductions in 

methane emissions.

Against the backdrop of rapid urbanisation, 

depleting landfill capacity and rising awareness 

of environmental and pollution issues, there is  

an increasing need for governments to look into 

sustainable waste management solutions.

In Singapore, Keppel Seghers Tuas Waste-to-

Energy (WTE) Plant and Senoko WTE Plant are 

capable of processing more that 1.2 million 

tonnes of municipal solid waste per year, in the 

process supplying up to 550 gigawatt hours of 

green energy to the grid. This helps in landfill 

diversion by as much as 90% through a 

reduction in the volume of waste disposed,  

and contributes greatly to the reduction of 

methane emissions.

In China, driven by the government’s priority  

in tackling environmental issues, the country 

has targets set for both pollutant emission 

reduction and environment quality improvement 

in its 13th Five Year Plan. The focus on green 

development and innovation presents 

opportunities for Keppel Seghers to capture  

new WTE projects, as well as to deepen its 

footprint in China through strategic collaborations 

with local players.

Keppel Seghers has secured six contracts to 

provide WTE technology and services, including 

that from repeat customer Shenzhen Energy 

Environment Engineering Co for the Baoan  

WTE plant, which is slated to become the world’s 

largest WTE facility in terms of incineration 

capacity. With these developments, the company 

continues to reinforce its position as the leader 

among imported WTE technology solutions 

providers in China.

WTE technology and services have also been 

gaining recognition in the Southeast Asia region  

as a competitive solution for municipal solid 

waste management, while producing renewable 

power. Keppel Seghers will ride on this 

development trend to capture opportunities  

in new markets.

By converting non-recyclable waste into energy, we minimise 

the environmental impact of municipal waste.

Powering a Cleaner Future

Through our sustainable waste 

management solutions, we contribute 

towards reductions in methane emissions 

and volume of waste disposed.

Product Excellence

Renamed Keppel LeTourneau, the unit 

augments Keppel O&amp;M’s existing 

capabilities to provide a full-suite of 

end-to-end jackup rig solutions to  

its customers.

According to estimates by the International 

Energy Agency, gas is expected to be the 

fastest-growing fossil fuel for the next  

few decades, with demand rising at  

1.5% per annum from now to 2040,  

to make up a quarter of global energy 

demand. Keppel is well positioned to  

be an industry forerunner through  

its extensive gas strategy that spans  

the value chain from liquefaction to 

transportation to power generation.

Through its subsidiary, Gas Technology 

Development, Keppel O&amp;M signed a 

Memorandum of Understanding with 

Shell Eastern Petroleum (Shell), to  

jointly explore opportunities to cater

to the demand for Liquefied Natural Gas 

(LNG) as a fuel in coastal areas, inland 

waterways and the international marine 

sectors. Keppel O&amp;M further established 

a 50-50 joint venture (JV), FueLNG, with 

Shell to supply LNG bunkering services  

to vessels in the Port of Singapore. 

FueLNG subsequently secured its first 

two contracts from Shell to provide 

bunkering services to two dual-fuel  

diesel LNG tugs, which are being built by 

Keppel Singmarine for Maju Maritime  

and Keppel Smit Towage.

Separately, Keppel Shipyard’s execution 

of the world’s first-of-its-type floating 

liquefaction vessel conversion for Golar 

LNG is on track for completion in mid-2017. 

The deployment of Golar Hilli will put 

Keppel ahead of the curve for floating  

LNG solutions.

Reinforcing its leading position in offshore 

rig design, construction and repair; ship 

repair and conversion; and specialised 

shipbuilding, Keppel O&amp;M was conferred 

the 2015 APAC Company of the Year Award 

(Offshore &amp; Marine Services) at the Oil  

and Gas Council’s Asia-Pacific Oil &amp; Gas 

Awards in 2016.

Three of Keppel O&amp;M’s projects, namely 

the semisubmersible DSS™ Series rigs, 

KFELS N Class rigs and the Arctic 

icebreakers, were recognised as 

Singapore’s Top 50 Engineering Feats by 

the Institution of Engineers Singapore. 

This competition acknowledges 

engineering achievements that have made 

the greatest economic, infrastructural or 

societal impact to Singapore since 1965.

We are committed to superior solutions 

and execution excellence for building 

enduring relationships with our 

customers. 



Golar Hilli, the world’s 

first-of-its-type floating

Since the launch of the Keppel Innovation 

Convention in 2015, more Group-wide 

initiatives have been implemented  

to instil a culture of innovation among 

employees.

In 2016, the InnovateKeppel catalyst team, 

comprising representatives from across 

our businesses, was formed to coordinate 

and promote innovation efforts.

Keppel Young Leaders, a programme  

that seeks to groom high potential 

employees across the Group, also held  

its inaugural hackathon in 2016 where 

participants devised innovative solutions 

to address workplace challenges.

Innovation Through Partnerships

As part of its efforts to advance 

technology and innovation, Keppel O&amp;M 

partners leading industry players, 

government agencies and academic 

institutions to develop customised 

market-relevant solutions.

In 2016, KOMtech partnered the Lloyd’s 

Register Global Technology Centre in 

Singapore to improve the safety and 

performance of semisubmersible designs.

KOMtech also partnered American 

Bureau of Shipping’s (ABS) Singapore 

Innovation and Research Center to 

increase fuel efficiency by optimising 

moonpool size and shape to minimise  

hull resistance. Together with ABS, 

academia, and research agencies, 

KOMtech is also exploring ways to 

re-purpose its offshore technology and 

solutions to capture opportunities in the 

non-drilling sector.

The Keppel-National University of 

Singapore (NUS) Corporate Laboratory, 

which was set up in 2013, pursues three 

major research thrusts to address future 

challenges in the offshore industry: 

Future Systems, Future Yards and Future 

Resources. Under the three thrusts,  

the work of this synergistic industry-

university partnership covers four 

themes: deepwater technology, arctic 

technology, productivity enhancements 

for yard operations and Deepsea Seabed 

Nodule Harvesting.

The Corporate Laboratory comprises  

over 100 personnel, including KOMtech 

researchers as well as professors  

and doctorate students from NUS. In 

December 2016, the Corporate Laboratory 

held its inaugural Governance Board 

meeting. The meeting was chaired by

Keppel Corporation Limited  Sustainability Report 2016

Empowering Lives


We aim to instil a 

culture of safety  

where everyone goes 

home safe.

Overview

Safety is a core value at Keppel, an 

integral part of our business, and a key 

focus area for our Board of Directors and 

senior management. We are committed  

to provide a safe and healthy workplace 

for all our stakeholders.

Processes and systems are in place to 

identify, mitigate and report risks and 

communicate best practices across  

the Group, and we work with our 

contractors and subcontractors to  

ensure that they understand our 

requirements and expectations.

Management Approach

We focus on strengthening our frameworks 

and management systems as well as 

promoting a culture of safety ownership 

across our operations.

Strategy &amp; Policy

Our approach to safety management  

is guided by the Keppel Group’s Safety  

and Health strategy, which is focused  

on four aspects across our global 

operations – having an integrated 

framework, implementing effective 

management systems, promoting 

ownership and enhancing partnerships 

across our operations.

In 2016, the Group introduced the Zero 

Fatality roadmap which outlines 

actionable items to prevent incident 

recurrence, align systems and processes, 

strengthen compliance to procedures  

and bolster the capabilities of frontline 

managers. The roadmap is based on an 

analysis of previous incidences and an 

evaluation of current initiatives.

The effectiveness of our management 

approach is reviewed regularly. During  

the annual Keppel Health, Safety and 

Environment (HSE) Roundtable, senior 

management from our businesses share 

insights, best practices and exchange 

ideas to improve Keppel’s safety 

performance. The action plan generated 

during the session is incorporated into the 

Group’s safety roadmap and strategies.

All employees and third-party suppliers 

and contractors are expected to abide by 

the Keppel Corporation HSE Policy which 

places the highest priority on the health 

and safety of people and the protection  

of assets and the environment.

Best Practice

Our safety management system is 

routinely audited by independent 

consultants as well as internal audit teams. 

For example, Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine’s 

(Keppel O&amp;M) Cross Business Unit Audit 

ensures that policies and management 

systems are adhered to and that practices 

across our global yards are aligned.

Performance

Despite our best efforts, our Accident 

Severity Rate (ASR) increased in 2016.  

Our ASR in 2016 was 254 man-days lost 

per million man-hours compared to 115  

the year before, as we suffered seven 

fatalities globally in 2016. We are deeply 

saddened by the loss of our colleagues  

and have thoroughly investigated the 

causes, which were related to working  

at heights, high-pressure testing and 

diving activities. We determined the 

contributing factors and identified  

steps to prevent similar incidents in  

the future. Lessons learnt were shared 

across the Group.

Our Accident Frequency Rate (AFR) for 

2016 increased slightly to 0.15 accidents 

per million man-hours from 0.13 the year 

before. As the members of our workforce 

who are exposed to health and safety 

risks are largely male, the presentation  

of data according to gender was assessed  

to be immaterial.

The operations and maintenance  

operator for Keppel Infrastructure Trust’s 

Senoko WTE Plant was issued a partial 

Stop Work Order and a fine of $6,000 by 

Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower (MOM) 

for a fatal incident.

A contractor at Keppel DC Singapore  

4’s construction site was issued a  

Stop Work Order by MOM following a  

site inspection in 2016. The order was 

lifted shortly after, when the contractor 

implemented additional measures to 

enhance workplace safety.

Recognition

The Group was conferred 35 Workplace 

Safety and Health (WSH) Awards in 2016 

by MOM and Singapore’s WSH Council. 

This is the largest number of awards won 

by a single organisation in Singapore.  

The awards recognise WSH excellence.

Building Skillsets

We empower and train our stakeholders  

to ensure that all personnel are kept 

updated on safety measures and  

best practices.

In 2016, we invested approximately  

$37 million in enhancing infrastructure, 

upgrading systems and building knowledge 

and skillsets across the Group.

Our commitment to innovation extends  

to improving the safety of work processes. 

At the 10th annual Keppel Group Safety 

Convention, 53 Safety Innovation Projects 

were submitted, paving the way for 

solutions to be further developed into 

actual products. Some of the entries went 

on to compete at both industry and 

national levels and have since garnered 

awards (see page 69).

The Keppel Safety Training Centre at 

Keppel Shipyard in Singapore offers a 

complete range of safety training and 

certification courses in both trade-

specific and broad-based skills for all 

levels of the workforce. The Centre is 

equipped with classrooms, an e-learning

To promote safer driving, Keppel Logistics 

organised Defensive Driving courses for 

its drivers.

Recognising Safe Behaviour

The Keppel Group Safety Convention 

2016 brought over 900 employees, 

partners, contractors and 

subcontractors together to reaffirm 

their collective commitment to uphold 

the Group’s core value of safety. The 

annual event also saw the continuation 

of the Keppel Group Safety Awards, 

which recognises employees who  

have gone the extra mile to foster  

safe and healthy work environments.

Themed ‘Harnessing Strengths 

towards HSE Excellence’, the event 

included a sharing session by six 

employees from across the Group,  

who spoke on their roles in contributing 

towards enhancing safety at their  

work sites.

promptly. Major incidents are also shared 

and discussed at quarterly BSC meetings.

Keppel O&amp;M’s HSE team unveiled its  

Life Saving Rules in 2016 to provide 

employees, and frontline workers in 

particular, with guidance on preventive 

measures they can take to keep 

themselves safe.

During the year, Keppel FELS organised  

a HSE campaign themed ‘Intervene! Don’t 

look away!’, to urge employees and 

contractors to intervene when they 

observe any unsafe behaviour at the 

yards. Keppel Singmarine organised a 

HSE Day 2016 with the theme ‘Protect 

Your Hands and Fingers at Work’, to 

reinforce the fundamentals of safe 

manual work. Keppel Shipyard conducted 

a ‘Prevention of Slip and Fall’ campaign  

to reinforce the importance of safe  

work practices.

Keppel Land’s employees, consultants 

and contractors came together to  

share best practices at the company’s 

WSH Recognition Event 2016, which 

awarded the efforts of project teams  

and contractors who have contributed  

to safety excellence. Separately, Keppel 

Land China organised a Contractors 

Safety Convention to reiterate the 

importance of safe work practices.

Keppel Infrastructure held its third  

annual HSE Roadshow where employees 

were briefed on the company’s HSE 

performance, targets, action plan and 

lessons. The company also held its 

inaugural Contractor HSE Forum to 

discuss safety issues and best practices.

Keppel Housing, which manages the 

accommodation of our yards’ direct 

workers, hosted a HSE Roadshow to 

empower residents with safety and health 

knowledge. The roadshow was supported 

by several government agencies, including 

MOM, the WSH Council and the Health 

Promotion Board (HPB).

Safety &amp; Health

Keppel’s HSE professionals also contribute 

towards upholding the industry’s safety 

standards. Derek Sim, Senior HSE Manager 

of Keppel FELS, and Mohd Aliffi Ismail, 

Assistant General Manager (HSE) of 

Keppel Shipyard, represent ASMI and are

Influencing our Supply Chain

We work closely with all stakeholders, 

including our contractors and 

subcontractors, to maintain high safety 

standards throughout our workforce.  

Our subcontract workers undergo the 

same safety training as direct employees.

To raise industry standards, we work 

closely with MOM and the WSH Council to 

roll out safety initiatives and encourage 

our subcontractors to equip themselves 

with relevant safety certifications from 

the WSH Council. The Keppel Group has 

also been a regular sponsor of annual 

national safety events, including the 2016 

editions of the WSH Conference, National 

WSH Campaign and bizSAFE Convention.

At Keppel FELS, members of the 

Subcontractors Executive Council Safety 

Committee, comprising representatives  

of different trade sections including HSE, 

meet regularly to discuss safety initiatives 

and share best practices.

As bizSAFE partners, Keppel FELS, 

Keppel Shipyard and Keppel Singmarine 

actively encourage contractors to progress 

through the levels of the bizSAFE 

programme. Since 2013, Keppel Shipyard 

has imposed a bizSAFE Level 4 

certification requirement for resident 

contractors before they are able to 

undertake work at the yard.

As a bizSAFE Mentor, Keppel Land 

encourages contractors to develop and 

implement safety initiatives at their 

workplaces. Prior to their appointment, 

Keppel Land’s main contractors must be 

confirmed as bizSAFE partners, ensuring 

that their subcontractors meet the 

standards set by the WSH Council.

Keppel Seghers was recognised for its 

efforts in encouraging HSE excellence  

and was awarded bizSAFE Partner  

status by the WSH Council in 2016.

The winning Safety 

Innovation Teams 

showcased their 

projects at the annual 

Keppel Group Safety 

Convention, which was 

attended by Sam Tan, 

Minister of State,  

Prime Minister’s Office, 

Ministry of Manpower 

and Ministry of  

Foreign Affairs  

(second from right).

Across the Keppel Group, we continue to develop 

innovative solutions to improve work processes 

and enhance safety.

Promoting Safety Innovations 



Promoting a strong safety culture is a key tenet of 

Keppel’s safety strategy. In developing innovative 

and effective safety solutions, we encourage 

ground up, employee-led initiatives, so as to 

cultivate a sense of ownership at all levels.

In 2016, a total of 53 Safety Innovation Teams 

submitted Safety Innovation Projects – innovative 

and practical solutions to address challenges on 

the ground. Three Platinum, five Gold, 12 Silver 

and 15 Bronze Awards were presented to the 

winning teams at the annual Keppel Group  

Safety Convention.

The top three innovations were:

• To reduce risks, a team from Keppel 

Infrastructure developed a mechanical 

spring-loaded scraper to clean stop gate 

guides, thereby eliminating the need for  

divers or expensive cleaning equipment.  

This is estimated to have achieved an 

estimated cost saving of $80,000 per  

annum on third-party services.

• To eliminate risks associated with working at 

heights, a team from Keppel FELS designed 

and fabricated a set of rollers which allow 

raw water pipes to be installed horizontally 

onto the legs of jackup rigs. This enables  

the installation to be done at ground-level 

instead of requiring the workers to climb  

up scaffoldings. The initiative has resulted  

in savings of $5,000 per water piping 

installation project. Productivity has also 

improved, with 64 man-hours required  

per water piping installation as compared  

to 113 man-hours.

• To enhance the safety of workers, a team 

from Keppel Shipyard developed an 

easy-to-assemble modular rail structure 

and trolley to remove thrusters from the 

ship’s hull for repair. The innovation has 

eliminated the need for workers to enter  

the tunnel for hot work, or to physically  

move the thruster. This reduces the risk  

of worker injuries from such work.

Special Focus

We encourage employee-driven 

safety projects to cultivate a sense of 

ownership at all levels.

Keppel Corporation Limited  Sustainability Report 2016

Empowering Lives




Our people are our 

most valuable asset. 

We aim to attract 

and retain the best 

talents and grow the 

capabilities of our 

people.

Overview

Our people are our most valuable asset. 

We believe in investing in our workforce 

and developing our employees to their 

fullest potential.

Our total workforce, comprising full and 

part-time permanent employees and 

excluding our contractor workforce,  

was 26,457 in more than 20 countries. 

The data reported in this section takes 

into account significant subsidiaries  

and associated companies managed  

by Keppel.

Faced with a prolonged and challenging 

external environment, Keppel Offshore &amp; 

Marine (Keppel O&amp;M) has been taking  

the necessary steps to ensure that 

operations are sustainable by reducing 

our direct staff strength and 

subcontractor workforce in Singapore  

and overseas in line with our operational 

requirements.

Where possible, we continue to explore 

redeploying manpower to other business 

units within Keppel where additional 

resources are required.

The age profile of our workforce is largely 

young, with 30.1% of employees under the 

age of 30 and 36.9% between the ages of 

30 and 39. During the year, 2,846 people 

were hired. Overall voluntary turnover rate 

was 15.2% in Singapore and 12.3% globally, 

an increase from 10% and 8.9% in 2015 

respectively. This increase is largely due  

to the headwinds faced in the offshore  

and marine industry.

Management Approach

We respect and uphold human rights 

principles, adhere to fair employment 

practices, and invest in developing and 

training our workforce. In doing so, we 

attract and retain the best talent and  

grow the capabilities of our people.

Human Rights

Keppel Corporation and our Group of 

Companies uphold and respect the 

fundamental principles set out in the 

United Nations (UN) Universal Declaration 

of Human Rights and the International 

Labour Organisation’s Declaration on 

Fundamental Principles and Rights at 

Work. Our approach to human rights is 

informed and guided by general concepts 

from the UN Guiding Principles on 

Business and Human Rights.

We have zero tolerance for unethical 

labour practices such as child labour, 

forced labour, slavery and human 

trafficking in any of our operations.  

Keppel also supports the elimination  

of exploitative labour. Our suppliers are 

expected to comply with the Group’s 

Supplier Code of Conduct, which holds 

them accountable to responsible labour 

practices in their operations.

Employee Engagement

87% 

Of employees surveyed indicated that 

they would “go beyond the norm”  

to contribute to Keppel’s success.

Local Hires 

60.3%

Of senior management are hired from 

local communities.

We adhere to fair employment practices, uphold 

human rights principles, and empower our workforce 

with opportunities for learning and development.

Our commitment to human rights is  

also supported by our Employee Code of 

Conduct, which sets the tone in relation to 

the Group’s stance against discrimination 

on any basis, inclusive of any bias on the 

basis of ethnicity, gender, religious beliefs, 

nationality, age or any physical disability. 

The rules of conduct apply to all 

employees of Keppel Corporation and  

its subsidiary companies. Our stance  

on human rights is articulated in our 

Corporate Statement on Human Rights 

which is publicly available online.

Unions are our partners and we place  

great emphasis on maintaining a 

harmonious relationship with them. 

Approximately 37.9% of our global  

workforce are bargainable employees 

covered by Collective Agreements (CA).

Guidelines are in place for the appropriate 

management of grievance cases.  

For unionised companies, employee 

grievances are resolved according  

to the grievance handling protocol spelt  

out in the respective CA. All registered 

grievances are investigated and tracked 

through to final closure. In the case  

of a grievance, our management  

and the union will undertake every  

reasonable effort to resolve the 

employee’s grievance promptly.

Worldwide, there were 19 grievance  

cases reported in 2016, three of which  

are pending resolution at the time of  

the printing of this report. All grievance  

cases in 2015 have been resolved.

Fair Employment Policies &amp; Practices

We adopt fair employment practices  

and comply with local labour regulations 

across our global operations and with 

minimum wage laws, where such  

laws exist.

In Singapore, Keppel adheres to the 

practices spelt out by the Tripartite 

Alliance for Fair and Progressive 

Employment Practices (TAFEP) and 

endorses its Employers’ Pledge of Fair 

Employment Practices, which are  

guided by the following five principles:

1. Recruit and select employees on the 

basis of merit (such as skills, experience 

or ability to perform the job), and 

regardless of age, race, gender, 

religion, marital status and family 

responsibilities, or disability.

2. Treat employees fairly and with respect 

and implement progressive human 

resource management systems.

3. Provide employees with equal 

opportunity to be considered for

training and development based on  

their strengths and needs to help  

them achieve their full potential.

4. Reward employees fairly based  

on their ability, performance, 

contribution and experience.

5. Comply with the labour laws and  

abide by the Tripartite Guidelines  

on Fair Employment Practices.

Keppel subscribes to a pay-for-

performance philosophy. We believe  

this drives ownership of collective  

goals and leads to a high-performance 

culture that creates long-term  

shareholder value.

Opportunities for advancement,  

promotion, recognition of achievements, 

compensation, training and other 

conditions of employment are provided 

based on merit. Regular performance 

reviews are conducted for all permanent 

employees. The process, undertaken  

jointly by the employee and supervisor, 

entails the setting of targets and a  

career developmental roadmap detailing 

work plans, training and measurable 

performance targets.

Diversity &amp; Inclusion

We believe that people should have  

access to the same opportunities 

regardless of their ethnicity, religion, 

gender, marital status or age.

Our hiring policies ensure equal 

employment opportunities for all.  

New hires are considered based on 

individual competencies as well as 

organisational and job fit. Our  

employment statistics, reviewed  

regularly, illustrate the diversity of our 

workforce. As at 31 December 2016,  

15.7% of our employees are female, 

compared to 12.9% in 2015. We recognise 

that there are certain sectors in our 

businesses, such as offshore and  

marine, which tend to attract larger 

proportions of male employees, due to  

the nature of the jobs. Nevertheless,  

we value diversity and inclusion, and  

are committed to the principle of equal 

employment opportunity.

We believe that hiring from local 

communities1 enhances our ability  

to understand local needs and  

strengthen our capabilities on the  

ground. We also develop local talents  

to assume management positions.  

Across our business units, 60.3% of  

senior management and 59.4% of our  

employees are citizens or permanent 

residents of the countries in which  

they work.

Retaining Experience

Keppel supports re-employability beyond

Singapore Tripartite Guidelines on the 

Re-employment of Older Employees.

As at 31 December 2016, there were  

368 re-engaged staff within the Group,  

of which 95 were re-employed in 2016.

Through initiatives such as the Keppel 

O&amp;M Alumni, employees past and present 

have been able to stay connected and build 

meaningful networks with one another.

We also recognise retired members of the 

Keppel family, who have made valuable 

contributions to the growth of the company 

through the decades. In 2016, Keppel 

Fellows, an alumni comprising former 

board members of Keppel entities and 

selected members of senior management, 

was established to better engage 

distinguished former leaders, and harness 

their collective wisdom and experience.

Engaging Employees

Employee Engagement Survey

We rolled out the Keppel Global Employee 

Engagement Pulse Survey in 2016, which 

gave insight to specific areas affecting 

employee engagement. It was administered 

in eight languages to employees in 12 

countries. The survey achieved a strong 

response rate of 96% from a sample size 

of over 5,000 employees. The Group 

achieved a high engagement score, 

whereby 87% of employees surveyed 

indicated that they would “go beyond the 

norm” to contribute to Keppel’s success.

Enhancing Communication

Various staff engagement initiatives are 

organised throughout the year to enhance 

communication between management 

and staff.

them assimilate.

Building Strong Teams

We believe that cohesive teams are integral 

to a productive workforce. We continue to 

build camaraderie among employees 

through various platforms, such as the

United as OneKeppel



The annual Keppel Games aims to 

build cohesive teams and strong bonds 

among employees. 

The Keppel Games is a series of sports 

competitions organised annually by the Keppelite 

Recreation Club (KRC). The event is supported  

by business units across Keppel.

The 13th Keppel Games was held from May to 

November 2016 with the theme of ‘Rising to the 

challenge as OneKeppel’. The theme resonates with 

Keppel’s commitment to promote collaboration, 

harness the diverse strengths of our businesses, 

and hunt as a pack to seek new opportunities.

Over the seven months of competition, close to 

1,000 employees participated in 16 sporting events, 

which ranged from tennis and dragon boat, to cyber 

games and international chess. By undergoing 

intensive training together, employees forged  

new friendships and stronger bonds with their 

teammates from other business units. The regular 

training also helped encourage employees to  

learn new sports and lead active lifestyles.

Despite the fierce competition, employees 

demonstrated camaraderie and commendable 

sportsmanship throughout the Games  

by helping each other on and off the field,  

cheering each other on the sidelines and 

congratulating opposing teams on their  

good performance.

Lim Tow Fok, President of KRC and General 

Manager of Property Management at Keppel 

Land, said, “Keppel Games sets the perfect 

stage for a display of the passion, sportsmanship 

and team spirit of our employees. Into its 13th 

year, the Games has proven to be more than 

just a sporting event showcasing athletic 

prowess. It serves as an excellent platform for 

employees across the Group to develop new 

friendships, forge closer bonds and achieve our 

vision of OneKeppel. The collective pride that 

our employees display in flying the Keppel flag 

is what makes the games truly compelling.”

Medals aside, the annual Keppel Games  

once again provided a fun and meaningful 

platform for employees across the Group to 

interact, instilled in them a sense of belonging 

and helped forge bonds that lead to united and 

effective teams.

Overview

Keppel aims to deliver lasting socio-

economic benefit to the communities 

where we operate. In engaging and 

nurturing communities, we aim to  

achieve a sustainable future together.

We invest in programmes aligned with our 

Sustainability Framework, which outlines 

Keppel’s commitment to Sustaining 

Growth, Empowering Lives and  

Nurturing Communities.

We champion initiatives that protect and 

help improve the environment. As leaders 

in our businesses, we also support 

industry efforts that foster collaboration 

to promote sustainable development.

We empower lives by participating in 

workforce development programmes that 

equip individuals with relevant skills and 

experience, and we spearhead initiatives 

that instil an appreciation for the arts in 

children and youth. 

Management Approach 

Community development is a material 

topic for Keppel. As a Founding Member  

of the Company of Good programme by 

the National Volunteer &amp; Philanthropy 

Centre, Keppel strives to champion 

holistic corporate giving in Singapore.

In partnership with organisations that 

share our values, we commit up to 1%  

of the Group’s net profit to worthy social 

and environmental causes. These 

contributions are coordinated and 

disbursed by Keppel Care Foundation,  

the Group’s philanthropic arm, which is 

governed by its own Board of Directors.  

The Foundation has disbursed $25 million 

to worthy causes till date, since its  

launch in 2012.

To deliver a greater positive impact,  

we bolster philanthropic giving with 

employee volunteerism led by Keppel 

Volunteers, the Group’s volunteer 

movement. Employees are given two  

days of paid volunteer leave annually.

In 2016, the Group’s total social 

investment spend was $5.21 million. 

Employees across the Group in Singapore 

achieved over 8,000 hours of community 

service, an increase of 3,000 hours  

over the 5,000 hours in 2015.

Keppel is a Gold Member of Global 

Compact Network Singapore, the national 

society championing Corporate Social 

Responsibility (CSR) in Singapore.  

To promote dialogue on CSR and  

social innovation, Keppel supported  

the CSR and Social Innovation Forum  

in 2016. The conference was jointly 

organised by Global Compact Network 

Singapore and Social Innovation Park,  

and explored ideas and initiatives to 

support the creation of an ecosystem  

that rewards sustainable businesses  

and ground-up innovation.

Sustaining Growth

Conserving Biodiversity

Keppel committed $2.08 million to the 

establishment of Keppel Discovery 

Wetlands, a freshwater forest wetland 

ecosystem historically found in the vicinity 

of the Singapore Botanic Gardens.

The restored 1.8 hectare forest wetlands 

which is located in the Learning Forest 

extension of the Gardens enhances the 

biodiversity in the area and provides 

opportunities for members of the public  

to experience a freshwater forest wetland 

habitat in the heart of the city.

Keppel Volunteers will serve as Green 

Ambassadors for the wetlands, and engage 

schools, community groups and other 

visitors to promote eco-consciousness  

and facilitate learning of Singapore’s 

freshwater swamp ecosystem  

(see pages 90 and 91).

Other environmental initiatives include 

Keppel Volunteers’ participation in 

NParks’ Intertidal Watch survey which 

supports the science-based management 

of Singapore’s coastal areas. Employees 

from Keppel FELS and BrasFELS also 

participated in beach clean-ups in 

Singapore and Brazil respectively.

Promoting Education

Improving access to education empowers 

children who are marginalised, and 

levels their playing field.

Since its inception in 2012, Keppel  

Care Foundation has disbursed over  

$11 million to educational causes,  

which include scholarships and 

bursaries for students of local 

universities and institutes of higher 

learning. Over 200 scholarships, 

academic awards, bursaries and study 

grants have been given to deserving 

students from low-income families. 

These include the Keppel Bursary  

and Keppel Engineering Bursary offered 

by the National University of Singapore; 

the Keppel Care Foundation-Singapore 

University of Technology and Design 

Scholarship (SUTD), Keppel Award  

of Excellence and Keppel Bursary  

Award offered by SUTD, and the

are also invited to the BrasFELS  

shipyard, where volunteers share  

their academic and professional  

journeys to inspire the students.  

Over a hundred students benefitted  

from this programme in 2016.

We strongly support the advancement 

of the arts and believe that an 

appreciation of the arts should be 

cultivated from a young age.

Arts Advocate

We believe that the arts inspire, contribute 

towards civic engagement and social 

cohesion, and build bridges between 

cultures. Through supporting the arts,  

we aim to stimulate the cross-fertilisation  

of ideas, and foster creativity and 

expression. This will in turn contribute  

to the vibrancy of our communities.

Singapore’s National Arts Council 

awarded Keppel Corporation its ninth 

consecutive Distinguished Patron of the 

Arts award in 2016, in recognition of our 

contribution to Singapore’s art scene. 

Keppel Centre for Art Education 

Created to develop curiosity and 

imagination in children and youth, the 

Keppel Centre for Art Education at the 

National Gallery Singapore provides 

creative learning spaces for families, 

students and educators to experience, 

create and talk about art. The Centre is 

the region’s first art education facility of 

its kind in the region.

Established with a $12 million 

commitment from Keppel, the Centre  

is designed to inspire learning in young 

children through art. The Centre features 

four vibrant spaces, namely the Art 

Corridor, Art Playscape, Project Gallery 

and Children’s Museum. Guided school 

tours and workshops introduce visual 

literacy, as well as analytical and 

interpretive skills to students and support 

Singapore’s national curriculum.

The Centre benefitted over 300,000 

participants in 2016. Over 50 Keppel 

Volunteers have been trained under the 

‘Best Friends of the Gallery’ programme 

and have contributed more than 500 

hours facilitating activities for young 

visitors at the Centre every weekend. 

Keppel Nights 

Keppel Nights, developed in partnership 

with Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay, 

provides students from heartland schools 

with access to world-class performances, 

such as ‘Sleeping Beauty’ by award-winning 

choreographer Matthew Bourne and 

‘Savage Land’ by the acclaimed Beijing 

People’s Art Theatre. Since its relaunch  

in November 2013, the programme has 

benefitted close to 20,000 students  

from 72 schools.

Keppel Nights includes an element  

of experiential learning, with dance, music 

and drama workshops that give students 

a chance to try out various art and cultural 

forms and get a taste of performing.

In Singapore, Keppel Volunteers  

organise regular and diverse activities 

with beneficiaries, such as students  

of Care Corner and senior citizens of  

Thye Hua Kwan Senior Activity Centres  

(see page 89).

Keppel Volunteers has also been 

coordinating the Group’s support of blood 

donation drives by the Singapore Red 

Cross and the Health Sciences Authority 

of Singapore since 2012. The donation 

drives play a crucial role in growing the 

blood donor pool in Singapore. For its 

efforts, Keppel Volunteers was recognised 

as a Blood Mobile Organiser Merit Winner 

by the Singapore Red Cross and the 

Health Sciences Authority of Singapore  

on World Blood Donor Day 2016.

Keppel Land, in partnership with its 

business partner, built a community 

facility for underprivileged children  

in Jakarta, Indonesia. The facility is 

well-furnished with a multi-purpose  

hall, library, playground and sports 

facilities. Named Ruang Publik Terpadu 

Ramah Anak Duri Kosambi, this facility  

is part of the Jakarta government’s 

citywide initiative to build community 

spaces for low-income families.

In Brazil, volunteers from BrasFELS 

regularly visit the residents of Elderly 

Home São Vicente de Paulo and hold 

donation drives to provide the home  

with daily necessities. BrasFELS also 

hosted a group of special needs  

students to a visit at the shipyard in 2016, 

when the shipyard received an Olympic 

Torch bearer and representatives of the 

Olympic Committee who disembarked 

from a boat into BrasFELS during their 

journey through Angra dos Reis. It was an 

inspiring occasion for all when the torch 

bearer walked the length of the yard’s 

Finger Pier before joining the students  

for photos.

In Tianjin, China, volunteers from  

Keppel Land China (Tianjin) dedicate their 

time and efforts to provide companionship

participate in charity sports events that 

support worthy causes.

Employees from across the Group joined 

over 5,000 participants from the finance 

industry and Singapore Exchange 

(SGX)-listed companies in the SGX Bull 

Charge Run 2016 to raise money for four 

charities in Singapore, namely AWWA,  

Fei Yue Community Services, Autism 

Association (Singapore) and Shared 

Services for Charities.

To raise funds for Charity Water, a 

non-profit organisation that provides 

clean and safe drinking water to people  

in developing countries, employees 

participated in the Green Corridor  

Run that was held in conjunction with 

Singapore’s World Water Day celebrations. 

Teams from Keppel put their fitness  

to the test to raise money for charitable 

causes. Runners from Keppel came  

in third place in the ‘Race to the Sky’ 

Vertical Marathon, which raised funds  

for Community Chest beneficiaries.  

Our teams also emerged as the Champion 

of Football With A Heart, a football 

fundraiser jointly organised by Singapore

Keppel Care Foundation is the Group’s philanthropic  

arm which sharpens, coordinates and sustains  

the Group’s efforts in corporate giving. 

Keppel Care Foundation: A Holistic Approach to Giving 

Since its inception in 2012, Keppel Care 

Foundation has disbursed $25 million in  

aid of causes that resonate with the company’s 

beliefs and values. It focuses on initiatives  

that protect the environment, promote 

education, arts and culture, or care for  

the underprivileged.

Such initiatives include the Keppel Discovery 

Wetlands at Singapore Botanic Gardens,  

the Keppel Centre for Art Education at the 

National Gallery, KK Women’s and Children’s 

Hospital (KKH) Health Endowment Fund, as 

well as endowment scholarships, bursaries 

and awards with various institutes of  

higher learning.

Where possible, the foundation’s contributions 

are complemented by employee volunteerism.

Robert Chong, CEO of the Foundation, who  

is also Keppel Corporation’s Director of Group 

Human Resources, shared, “We strive to 

achieve a corporate giving approach that  

is not only impactful and sustainable,  

but also engaging for our employees.  

This helps amplify desirable outcomes for  

our beneficiaries.”

For example, Keppel Volunteers facilitate 

activities for young visitors at the Keppel Centre 

for Art Education and organise ward activities 

for the children in KKH’s subsidised wards.

The Foundation disbursed $4.11 million in  

2016, with part of the funds channelled to the 

following causes:

• Singapore Cancer Society to provide 

subsidies, assistance, rehabilitation, hospice 

care and screenings for needy patients;

• Club Heal, to provide rehabilitation services 

to persons with mental illness; and

• NTUC U-Care Fund, to provide financial

Our community outreach initiatives are spearheaded 

by Keppel Volunteers, our Group-wide volunteer 

movement. 

Keppel Volunteers: Making a Difference

Keppel Volunteers collaborates with  

numerous non- profits to make a difference  

in the lives of the underprivileged.

Keppel Volunteers, a ground-up movement, was 

started in 2000 by a group of Keppel employees.  

The group collaborates with numerous charities 

and voluntary welfare organisations on regular 

activities to make a difference to the lives of  

the less privileged. In 2016, Keppel Volunteers 

achieved over 8,000 hours of community service  

in Singapore, an increase of 3,000 hours over  

the 5,000 hours in 2015. 

Keppel Volunteers works closely with our partners 

to organise regular and diverse activities for 

beneficiaries such as the children from Care 

Corner and KKH, as well as senior citizens from 

Thye Hua Kwan Senior Activity Centres. 

Since 2015, Keppel has also taken steps to initiate 

skills-based volunteerism projects. In the past year, 

finance officers in the Group organised a series of 

workshops to equip low-income families with 

financial literacy skills. The Company intends to drive 

more of such initiatives that match a volunteer’s 

skills with meaningful opportunities to use them.

To encourage volunteerism, employees are 

given two days of volunteer leave annually.  

The Company has also designated August  

as Keppel Community Month to rally 

volunteers and spur collaboration among 

business units in driving outreach activities. 

Regular volunteers are also recognised for 

their efforts at the annual Keppel Volunteers 

appreciation event. 

Teri Liew, President of Keppel Volunteers and 

Deputy General Manager of Group Corporate 

Communications, Keppel Corporation, 

enthused, “In helping others, we enrich our 

own lives and experiences. We bond with 

like-minded colleagues and pick up new  

soft skills, such as interacting with children,  

or caring for the elderly and disabled.  

The planning and executing of the diverse

Located in the Singapore Botanic Gardens,  

the Keppel Discovery Wetlands allows members  

of the public to experience a unique natural habitat 

in the heart of the city. 

Keppel Discovery Wetlands: Conserving Our Biodiversity

Keppel has committed $2.08 million to the  

Garden City Fund to support the restoration of a 

freshwater forest wetland ecosystem historically 

found in the vicinity of the Singapore Botanic 

Gardens, which is Singapore’s first UNESCO  

World Heritage site.

This restored freshwater forest wetlands, named 

Keppel Discovery Wetlands, was officially opened 

by Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong 

on 31 March 2017. Located in the Learning Forest 

extension of the Singapore Botanic Gardens,  

the restored 1.8 hectare forest is designed with 

ecological considerations in mind, and includes  

a carefully curated plant collection of over 200 

species. It enhances the biodiversity found in  

the area and provides opportunities for the public 

to access and experience a freshwater forest 

wetland habitat right in the heart of the city.

At the launch of the Learning Forest, Mr Lee 

shared, “Our Botanic Gardens thrives not because 

of the interesting mix of plants, but because 

within it, there is life. It is teeming with activity.  

It is loved and nurtured by the community, by all age 

groups. I would like to thank everyone who have 

worked so hard to create this Learning Forest - 

corporate partners such as Keppel and Singapore 

Press Holdings, the many volunteers who spend 

time planting trees or leading guided walks.  

For them, it is a labour of love.”

On the initiative, Keppel Corporation Chairman Lee 

Boon Yang commented, “The Keppel Discovery 

Wetlands is a restored freshwater forest wetland 

habitat in the heart of our city. It provides a unique 

opportunity for Singaporeans to learn about our 

amazing biodiversity. This initiative resonates with 

Keppel’s commitment to sustainable development. 

We hope that all visitors will be inspired to better 

understand and appreciate Singapore’s natural 

environment.”

Keppel Volunteers will serve as Green Ambassadors 

for the Keppel Discovery Wetlands, engaging schools 

and community groups so that visitors can discover 

and learn more about the freshwater swamp 

ecosystem and its flora and fauna.

As a symbol of Keppel’s commitment  

towards environmental conservation,  

50 Keppel Volunteers and senior management 

from the Keppel Group planted trees of  

various species at the Wetlands during the 

unveiling of plans for the Wetlands in 2016. 

An Immersive Outdoor Experience

The habitats in the Keppel Discovery Wetlands  

are complemented by trails and boardwalks. 

Features of the Wetlands include the Orchid 

Islands, Botanists’ Boardwalk, Pulai Marsh  

and Discovery Trail.

Orchid Islands

The Orchid Islands showcases a large number  

of native orchids, many of which have been 

conserved through NParks’ native orchid 

conservation programme. This is the first  

time that the public will be able to admire  

the forms and colours displayed by such  

a wide variety of native orchids in their  

natural habitat.

Botanists’ Boardwalk

At the Botanists’ Boardwalk, visitors will be  

able to learn about the historic discoveries 

made by the Gardens’ earliest botanists,  

who contributed to the knowledge of the 

region’s flora by making frequent expeditions  

to study the plants growing in various localities 

and habitats throughout Southeast Asia.

Pulai Marsh

The Pulai Marsh is a recreation of the 

freshwater swamp habitat historically found in 

the vicinity of the Singapore Botanic Gardens 

area. With its restoration, the Pulai Marsh 

enables native species in the area to flourish, 

and provides a refuge in the city for wetland 

wildlife to thrive.

Discovery Trail

The Discovery Trail brings visitors through  

the Orchid Islands, Botanists’ Boardwalk and  

Pulai Marsh, where they will be able to see  

and be educated about plants that grow in 

frequently-flooded, inaccessible places.

Keppel Corporation Limited  Sustainability Report 2016

Other Information


Independent Assurance Statement

Introduction

DNV GL Business Assurance Pte Ltd,  

part of DNV GL Group, has been engaged 

by Keppel Corporation Ltd. (Keppel) to 

provide independent assurance over the 

Sustainability Report 2016 (the Report) 

which is available to stakeholders from 

Keppel’s website and in print. 

Keppel is responsible for the collection, 

analysis, aggregation, preparation and 

presentation of the printed version of  

the Report. The responsibility of DNV GL  

is to provide independent assurance  

to the management of Keppel on  

the reliability of the information  

contained in the Report and to express 

overall opinion as per the scope of 

assurance engagement as defined in  

this statement. 

Our responsibility is in accordance with 

the terms of reference agreed on with 

Keppel. The assurance engagement is 

based on the assumption that the data 

and information provided are complete 

and true. 

The intended recipients of the assurance 

statement are the stakeholders of Keppel. 

The Report covers the sustainability 

performances from the global operations 

and all subsidiaries and associated 

companies over which the Keppel Group 

has management control. The boundary  

of the report for each area is defined  

in the respective chapters and unless 

otherwise stated, will include those 

subsidiaries that Keppel has  

management control.

Scope of Assurance

The scope of work included a review of 

sustainability activities and performance 

data over the reporting period 1 January 

to 31 December 2016. This included:  

• Evaluation of the reporting principles 

for defining the sustainability report 

content and the quality in the Global 

Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards;

• Evaluation of adherence to 

AccountAbility’s principles provided  

in AA1000 AccountAbility Principles 

Standard 2008; 

• Statement, information and 

performance data contained within  

the Report; 

• Keppel’s process for determining 

material aspects for reporting and the 

management approach to material 

issues; and

• Keppel’s process for generating, 

gathering and managing the 

quantitative and qualitative data in  

the Report.

Verification Methodology

The assurance engagement was 

conducted in line with the requirements of 

the AA1000 Assurance Standard 2008, 

Type 2 assurance as well as the DNV GL 

Verification Protocol for Sustainability 

Reporting V5.01 (VeriSustainTM). A specific 

evaluation of the information and data on 

sustainability performance was related to 

Keppel’s selected core indicators set forth 

in the GRI Standards, as indicated in the 

GRI Content Index included in the Report. 

We applied a moderate level of assurance. 

The audit was carried out in March and 

April 2017 at the Keppel Corporation head 

office in Singapore and included site visits 

to the Keppel Land head office and  

Keppel FELS. As part of the verification, 

we performed sample-based audits and 

undertook the following activities:

• Challenged the sustainability-related 

statements and claims made in the 

Report and assessed the robustness  

of the underlying data management 

system, information flow and controls; 

• Interviewed representatives from the 

corporate headquarters as well as 

those from the various business units; 

• Conducted document reviews,  

data sampling and interrogation  

of supporting databases and the 

associated reporting system as  

they relate to selected content and 

performance data; 

• Reviewed the actions taken based  

on the materiality analysis carried  

out in 2016.

Limitation

The engagement excludes the 

sustainability management, performance 

and reporting practices of Keppel’s 

suppliers, contractors and any third-

parties mentioned in the Report. DNV GL 

did not interview external stakeholders  

as part of this assurance engagement. 

Any financial information from Keppel’s 

annual report and company reporting on 

operations in 2016 or other sources are 

not included in the scope of the assurance. 

Economic performances based on the 

financial data were cross-checked with 

internal documents and the audited 

financial statements. The aggregation  

and calculation processes for building 

economic performances were reviewed 

and tested by the verification team.  

Limited depth of evidence gathering  

was applied to inquiry and analytical 

procedures, as well as limited sampling  

at lower levels in the organisation.  

The baseline data for environmental  

and social performance is not verified, 

while the aggregated data is used for the 

1  The principles and concepts of the VeriSustainTM 

protocol are aligned with GRI Standards and the 

Assurance Standard AA1000AS. The protocol

Independent Assurance Statement

verification. DNV GL expressly disclaims 

any liability or co-responsibility for any 

decision a person or an entity may make 

based on this Assurance Statement.

Conclusion

In DNV GL’s opinion, and based on the 

scope of this assurance engagement, 

nothing has come to our attention to 

suggest that the Report does not  

properly describe Keppel’s adherence  

to the Principles for Defining Report 

Content in GRI Standards. 

DNV GL believes that the report has been 

prepared in accordance with the Core 

option of the GRI Standards. Further 

opinions with regard to the following 

Principles are made below:

Inclusivity

Keppel has identified six internal and 

external stakeholder groups such as 

Customers, Employees, Governments, 

Shareholders, Local Communities  

and Suppliers. Keppel’s stakeholder 

engagement activities occurred at the 

Group and business unit level through 

various platforms. In our opinion,  

the stakeholder group could include  

more overseas representations of  

where Keppel has significant impact  

or operations. 

Materiality

The internal review of businesses was 

combined with a review of external 

stakeholder issues to identify the issues 

that are significant to the stakeholders,  

so that the report content remains 

relevant to the stakeholders’ concerns 

and expectations. In 2016, Keppel 

reviewed the material environmental, 

social and governance issues internally 

with the Group Sustainability Working 

Committee and Steering Committee.  

The material issues were further  

reviewed by Keppel Corporation’s Board  

of Directors in 2017. The information has 

been considered in the preparation of  

the Report.

Responsiveness

The Report provides a comprehensive 

overview of the Group’s activities;  

it keeps stakeholders informed of 

corporate decisions in terms of 

achievements and performance in 

relation to the sustainability material 

arguments. Keppel’s stakeholder 

dialogues and materiality review were 

used to determine the type of information 

that is material to stakeholders.  

The information is considered in the 

preparation of the Report. 

Completeness

The Report has adequately covered  

the sustainability strategy, management 

approach and sustainability performances 

against the GRI selected indicators.  

The boundary of the Report covers the 

sustainability performances from the 

global operations and all subsidiaries and 

associated companies over which the 

Keppel Group has management control.  

A sustainability report should include in 

its boundary all entities that generate 

significant sustainability impacts  

(actual and potential) rather than solely  

within its management influence. 

Accuracy &amp; Reliability

Keppel has selected, compiled and 

reported information in a relatively 

consistent manner. The stakeholder  

can analyse changes in sustainability 

performance over time. Data 

inconsistencies identified during the 

verification process were corrected prior 

to the Report being published. DNV GL 

concludes that the level at which the 

Report adheres to the principle of 

Accuracy and the Reliability of the 

information on sustainability  

performance can be further improved.

Report Quality: Balance &amp; Neutrality

The document allows the reader to 

examine both the positive and the 

negative trends of Keppel’s performance 

in 2016, presenting a balanced  

account of the activities and results 

relevant to the reporting year, which  

is consistent with the corporate  

strategies. We consider the Report  

to be an impartial description of  

Keppel’s sustainability impact. 

Findings in Relation to Specific 

Sustainability Performance 

Information

The Report covers global operations  

and all subsidiaries and associated 

companies for which Keppel has 

management control, unless otherwise 

indicated. The reporting of the 

sustainability performance presented  

in the Report is collected centrally  

from the operating companies by a 

dedicated function in the Group and 

consolidated for reporting, which is a 

common approach used by large 

conglomerates. 

DNV GL has evaluated the reliability  

of data and information with regard  

to energy consumption, waste generation, 

greenhouse gas emissions, and health 

and safety performance indices at the 

Group level and operating companies’ 

level for Type 2 Assurance.

Other Information




Keppel uses a system called CR360  

to gather sustainability performance  

data globally. The data used for the  

Report this year is based on a combination 

of manual collection and collated 

information from CR360. The data  

owners interviewed are able to 

demonstrate that the trace to the  

origin, and the data source of the  

specific data and information  

are identifiable.  

Opportunities for Improvement

The following is an excerpt from the 

observations and opportunities reported 

to Keppel’s management. However,  

these do not affect our conclusions  

on the Report and are provided to 

encourage continual improvement. 

Without qualifying our conclusion  

above, DNV GL makes the following 

recommendations:

• To further enhance the internal 

verification process to improve 

consistency in data collection;

• To consider expanding the aspect 

boundary and including coverage  

on material aspects associated  

with suppliers; and 

• To consider further expanding on  

the disclosure of management 

approach (DMA), in particular,  

long term plans to address  

aspect-specific DMA related to 

material issues.

Statement of Competence &amp;  

Independence 

DNV GL is a leading provider of sustainability 

services, including the verification of 

sustainability reports. Our environmental 

and social assurance specialists operate in 

over 100 countries. DNV GL was not involved 

in the preparation of any statements or  

data included in the Report except for this 

Assurance Statement. DNV GL maintains 

complete impartiality toward stakeholders 

interviewed during the verification process.
