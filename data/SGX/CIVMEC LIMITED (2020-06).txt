ABOUT 

THIS REPORT

SCOPE

The purpose of this report is to enable key stakeholders to understand Civmec’s 

sustainability approach, actions, performance and key material issues for the 

financial year ended 30 June 2020 (FY2020). This report was approved by the 

Civmec Board of Directors (the ‘Board’) on 27 November 2020. Civmec Limited 

(Company Registration Number 201011837H) is the ultimate holding company of 

the Civmec group of companies. In this report, unless otherwise stated, references 

to ‘Civmec’, the ‘Company’ and the ‘Group’ refer to Civmec Limited and its 

controlled entities. The information in this report covers all operational activities 

undertaken by Civmec. Our share of operations from joint venture projects is 

reported on a proportionately consolidated basis, unless otherwise stated.

REPORTING APPROACH

Civmec’s Sustainability Report 2020 links our sustainability principles to our 

mission, vision and values. The report has been prepared in accordance with the 

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards 2016 core-level 

reporting, which focuses on identifying and reporting on topics that are material 

to our business and key stakeholders, in relation to environmental, social and 

governance (ESG) performance.

The GRI Standards create a common language for organisations and 

stakeholders, with which the economic, environmental, and social impacts of 

organisations can be communicated and understood. The Standards are designed 

to enhance the global comparability and quality of information on these impacts, 

thereby enabling greater transparency and accountability of organisations.1

We report our sustainability performance annually. To support this commitment, 

we are continuing to evolve and refine how we collect information to ensure 

quality data and insights are available in order to drive 

improvement in our sustainability performance over 

time. This process includes undertaking an internal 

audit of this report and the reporting process.

MESSAGE  

FROM THE BOARD

The primary role of the Board is to deliver mutually beneficial outcomes for all 

stakeholders and to ensure that the company is managed in accordance with best 

international corporate governance practices, meeting all obligations of the Singapore 

Exchange (SGX) and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). 

Central to Civmec’s approach to sustainability is our Never Assume 

philosophy, which underpins the company’s culture and drives behaviour, 

attitudes, decisions and actions. 

The sustainability of our business is intrinsically linked to the successful 

management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations 

and opportunities. Proactively identifying and understanding the risks faced by 

the business and adopting sustainable practices to mitigate these, in addition to 

capitalising on identified opportunities, has facilitated our growth. 

This report outlines Civmec’s management approach and performance across the 

key material risk areas identified, as a fundamental component of future strategy to 

drive sustainable growth. As part of its strategic formulation, the Board has carefully 

considered the material ESG factors that present the greatest risk and opportunity 

to the business and oversees the management and monitoring of these factors. 

Civmec’s sustainability agenda is focused on:

• continuing to operate with integrity;

•  actively contributing to the success and welfare of our people and the 

communities in which we operate;

•  ensuring our operations have minimal environmental impact; and

•  achieving our safety, health, environmental, people and financial targets.

Overwhelmingly, the company’s success relies on its ability to foster positive, 

meaningful and productive relationships with its key stakeholders, including employees, 

clients and partners, all of whom play an integral role in our ongoing success. 

Yours sincerely 

The Board, Civmec Limited

ABOUT 

CIVMEC

Civmec is an integrated, multi-disciplinary construction and engineering 

services provider to the Oil &amp; Gas, Metals &amp; Minerals, Infrastructure, and 

Marine &amp; Defence sectors.

Established in 2009, we are one of Australia’s leading providers of 

turnkey solutions across a range of core capabilities.

Our vast self-performance capability enables us to respond agilely to 

our clients’ needs and our commitment to innovation and technology 

enables us to work smarter, providing value-driven solutions. Focused on 

establishing long-term partnerships and working collaboratively with clients 

and delivery partners, we have played a significant role in the delivery of 

some of Australia’s most complex projects, including in remote, logistically 

challenging environments.

With the experience and capacity to establish site facilities anywhere in 

Australia to meet project specific requirements, we have permanent presence 

in Henderson, Western Australia (which is our corporate office location),  

in Newcastle, New South Wales, and at Gladstone in Queensland. 

Our strategically located manufacturing facilities in Western Australia  

and New South Wales support our vertically integrated operating model. 

Our facility in Henderson is the largest heavy engineering facility of its 

kind in Australia. Situated just 30 kilometres south of Perth, the facility is 

located on 200,000m2 of land with direct waterfront access in the Australian 

Marine Complex (AMC) precinct. The AMC also offers a further 440,000m2 

of Common User Facility (CUF) land and complementary facilities and 

equipment. With more than 100,000m2 of usable undercover area, serviced  

by 52 overhead travelling cranes, our facility includes a 53,000m² (usable floor 

area) Assembly Hall and a 29,300m² Fabrication Hall, complete with blast and  

paint facilities.

Our Newcastle facility is our prime manufacturing facility servicing the east 

coast market, while also supporting our west coast operations at peak times. 

It is located on 227,000m2 of waterfront land, just 14 kilometres from the port 

of Newcastle. With direct access to the Hunter River and two ship basins, the 

facility offers 30,000m2 of undercover area serviced by 24 overhead travelling 

cranes, including a 15,000m2 heavy engineering workshop and 7,500m² 

precast/pre-stressed concrete facility.

Our Gladstone facility is centrally located in a major hub of industrial activity in 

Queensland. This regional location allows us to house the essential equipment 

that we require to carry out our ongoing maintenance, shutdown and 

refractory activities for our resource sector clients in that region. A presence 

in this location allows us to mobilise rapidly to meet our clients’ planned and 

unplanned maintenance activities.

These world-class facilities, and 

our extensive construction 

equipment base, 

enable us to provide 

manufacturing, 

technical, 

administrative 

and logistical 

support to 

service projects 

of all sizes and 

complexities 

anywhere in 

Australia.

STAKEHOLDER INFORMATION 

&amp; MATERIALITY

The material issues 

addressed in this report 

reflect the priorities 

identified by our key 

stakeholders.

A materiality assessment was undertaken 

consistent with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 

Standards requirements. Members from key 

stakeholder groups, including management, 

staff, clients and the Board, were invited to 

participate in the survey. 

As expected, given the onset of the COVID-19 

pandemic in FY2020, occupational health and safety 

remained our highest ranked topic. The remaining 

results of the survey were generally consistent with 

the FY2019 survey results, further reinforcing those 

topics for inclusion again in this year’s report.  

In determining the material environmental, social and 

governance (ESG) factors selected, their relevance to 

the business, including our strategy, business model 

and key stakeholders, was considered. 

In 2015, the United Nations agreed on 17 Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs) as part of its 2030 

Agenda for Sustainable Development. The interrelated 

SDGs are a blueprint to achieve a better and more 

sustainable future for everyone across the planet. 

They address the global challenges we face, 

including those related to poverty, inequality, climate, 

environmental degradation, prosperity, and peace and 

justice. As a supporter of the SDGs, we understand 

we can positively contribute towards these goals 

through our own sustainable business practices.

Maintaining open lines of communication with our key stakeholders, 

both internal and external, is an ongoing priority for the business. 

This extends well beyond the formal consultation process 

undertaken to determine the business’ material issues. 

The table on the right highlights our key stakeholders and how we engage 

with them on an ongoing basis to drive our long-term sustainability.

OUR PEOPLE

During FY2020, we faced the challenges presented  

by COVID-19 head-on. Our priority was to continue to  

keep our people safe and employed and maintain a local, 

reliable service offering for our clients.

Our people are the heart of our business.  

We are proud to say that many of them have 

been with us since inception. Our focus remains 

steadfastly on providing meaningful pathways 

to enable our people to continue to develop and 

grow their career with us.

As a significant employer in our industry, across  

a broad spectrum of trades and disciplines, we  

also understand the important role we play in 

supporting the development of the next generation 

of tradespeople and industry professionals.

During FY2020 we implemented a number of 

initiatives to deliver best-practice in the way we 

support and manage our people, delivering on key 

items identified in the ‘Future Focus’ section of our 

2019 Sustainability Report. These included:

•  continued commitment to leadership training,

including identification of high potential individuals

and succession planning;

•  implementation of a succession planning

strategy focused on three key areas – executive

management, key operational roles, and diversity

targets;

•  focusing on strengthening our position as an

‘employer of choice’ and adopting industry

practices that are better than or, at least, aligned

with those of our competitors;

• development of a formalised graduate program;

•  expanding the reward and recognition initiatives

to target the direct workforce, implementing

recognition mechanisms through management

and peer-to-peer; and

•  review of Business Management Systems,

including Civtrac and payroll software platforms

to drive continuous improvement and efficiency

capitalisation.

Initiatives specifically focused on increasing female 

participation included: 

• focused recruitment campaigns;

•  reviewing occupations (including non-traditional

female roles), which can provide a more flexible

roster;

•  strengthening partnership programs with key

stakeholders, including clients, community groups

and job networks, providing the foundation skills

required for employment in our operating sectors

or pathways to higher level qualifications; and

•  increasing opportunities through our RTO, with

personalised training programs that provide

flexibility and ease of access, which remove the

barriers that discourage women from gaining

the skills and knowledge required to enter our

industry sectors.

During FY2020, we maintained our position as a significant employer 

in our industry. As we approached the end of the year, we had in the 

region of 2,000 people actively involved in our operational activities 

across the business. 

We take great pride in our self-performance capability, enabling us to provide our 

clients with quality products and services that support their activities, and offering 

our people sustainable opportunities to grow their career with us. Multi-skilling our 

workforce provides a significant competitive advantage, with employees adaptable 

and able to be mobilised across jobs, sites and locations.

NEW EMPLOYEE HIRES AND EMPLOYEE TURNOVER

The attraction and retention of skilled employees is a critical focus, and a potential 

risk, for our business, particularly given the cyclical nature of the industry in which 

we operate. The following tables illustrate our new employee hires and employee 

turnover during FY2020, by age group and gender. The statistical pattern 

illustrated is typical of our industry, where cyclical/short-term project contracts are 

awarded, and therefore these numbers represent the on-hire/off-hire process.  

The statistics also highlight the challenge of attracting females into operational 

roles, given the nature of the work we do across traditionally male-dominated 

trades and disciplines.

As a progressive, technology-driven company, 

we recognise the importance of continually 

investing in the training and development of  

our people, providing progressive career 

pathways as a fundamental component of 

our retention strategy. Our core value of 

Collaboration means we work in partnership 

with our people to identify their individual 

training and development needs. 

REGISTERED TRAINING ORGANISATION

We have invested significantly in facilities and training 

programmes and are a recognised Registered 

Training Organisation (RTO code 52645). Our RTO is 

registered nationally with the Australian Skills Quality 

Authority (ASQA) and delivers skills and competency-

based training in every state across Australia, 

overseen by our full-time Learning and Development 

Manager. In FY2020, Civmec RTO processed 

1,530 enrolments for nationally accredited units of 

competence and Verification of Competency (VOC) 

delivered by our RTO. The role of the RTO is to create 

a skilled and diverse workforce that drives our high-

performance culture and supports the growth and 

retention of our people. 

The RTO has the scope to deliver four Nationally 

Accredited Qualifications in Work Health and Safety, 

Leadership and Management; Engineering and 

Quality Auditing.  The RTO also offers over 35 units 

of competence (short courses); specialising in high 

risk work licensing and activities, including crane 

operations, rigging, scaffolding, forklift and elevated 

work platform operations. In addition to the high risk 

work units, we also provide training for various mobile 

plant operations, such as excavator, backhoe and 

roller operations, and specialised training for tilt-up 

panel works.

A significant number of business leaders undertook 

our leadership training program, LEAD, during the 

year. This program, launched in 2019, provides 

targeted training in Risk Management Processes; 

Communication, On-site Operations; and Leadership 

in the Workplace.

In 2020, the RTO broadened the scope of registration 

in response to the diversification of Civmec’s 

operations. The additions to the scope align with 

the specific shipbuilding requirements for OPV and 

the shipbuilding facility. Focussing on emergency 

response, Civmec RTO can now deliver quality, 

customised training in:

• CPR and first aid;

• emergency life support;

• gas testing;

• low voltage rescue;

• fire response and equipment; and

• leading an emergency control organisation.

With the inclusion of these units, we can now 

internally provide first aid training. 

Health and safety is a significant aspect of every 

course that the RTO provides, which increases the 

overall knowledge and safety of Civmec employees as 

they participate in work activities. Through the RTO, 

employees are trained to see and manage risks in a 

more proactive way within their workplace.

APPRENTICES AND TRAINEES

Our commitment to supporting the future of our 

industry and continuing to grow local industry 

capacity and capability is reflected in the engagement 

of more than 90 apprentices, trainees and graduates 

across our operations during FY2020. This represents 

a significant increase of 50% compared to FY2019. 

Our apprentices include fabrication (boilermakers 

and welders), carpenters, serviceperson mechanics, 

bricklayers, mechanical and electrical trades, and 

our trainees provide functional support in business 

administration, human resources and logistics. 

Our apprenticeship program incorporates 

advanced technical capability, modern facilities, 

and individualised training and development 

opportunities. We provide apprentices with 

unparalleled opportunities to work across a diverse 

range of specialist capabilities and sectors, including 

heavy engineering fabrication and construction in the 

resources, infrastructure and defence markets.

experienced team of technical and management 

specialists, making Civmec traineeships an excellent 

way to start a career. 

Traineeship qualifications offered include: 

•  Human Resources;

•  Business Administration;

•  Logistics/Warehousing;

“ 

Starting my apprenticeship 

at Civmec has helped 

kick-start my career”



“My interest in welding started when I was at school; 

I received some insight into what was involved and 

immediately the hands-on work really interested me. 

Starting my apprenticeship at Civmec has helped kick-

start my career. So far, I have learnt several new skills 

and lessons that will help me in my future endeavours. 

My goal is to finish my apprenticeship and go on to 

specialise in welding of exotic materials and/or look into 

moving into welding inspection at Civmec.”

APPRENTICES AND TRAINEES (CONTINUED)

Civmec apprenticeships and traineeships are 

recognised nationally and are highly regarded in the 

industry. We encourage applications from women and 

people with diverse backgrounds, including Aboriginal 

and Torres Strait Islanders.

Four of our talented young apprentices received 

nominations in their categories at the 2019 Master 

Builders Apprentice of the Year Awards in November 

and between them secured several overall winner 

awards. We were also extremely pleased to receive the 

Skill Hire Host Trainer of the Year Award at this event. 

With our HSE Graduate Program successfully 

upskilling and developing many HSE professionals 

since it was established in 2018, we have now 

extended the opportunity for graduates to join the 

business with the launch of our Graduate Engineering 

Program in January 2020. The extraordinary benefit 

of this program for these young professionals is that, 

given our multi-disciplined, multi-sector operations, 

they get to deal with a very wide range of different 

experiences and challenges that gives them the 

rounded training they would struggle to achieve in 

other organisations.  

We continue to work in collaboration with local 

universities to ensure we attract quality candidates 

into these programs. 

Our commitment and pursuit to manage critical 

risks in the workplace and further develop strong 

leadership and safety culture remains a focus and, 

in 2020, in partnership with Curtin University, we 

launched the Robert Cunico Health and Safety 

Scholarship. This Scholarship will be awarded on 

an annual basis, as we are committed to ensuring 

that we support the training of our youth and keep 

our focus on the importance of safe work practices 

across our industry. 

We are also continuing to work with South 

Metropolitan TAFE and local high schools for our 

school-based traineeship program, which was 

introduced in 2019. This program provides the 

opportunity for local students completing Year 10, 

11 or 12 to undertake work experience through 

the year at our Henderson facility, whilst continuing 

their school education. Initially focused on students 

interested in the Metal Fabrication trades, this year we 

have expanded the program to provide school based 

apprenticeships within the heavy plant mechanics 

and logistics fields. On completion of their studies 

and traineeship, students are considered for an 

opportunity to join our apprenticeship program.

PERFORMANCE AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT

We perform a formal Performance and Career 

Appraisal process which is undertaken annually 

at the beginning of each year. This process 

requires employees to review their previous year’s 

performance, meet with their manager to discuss 

this assessment, and set goals and targets for the 

coming 12 months. Learning, development and 

career opportunities are identified throughout this 

process and monitored and progressed throughout 

the year. The process performed during this period 

has led to the enrolment and development of 

employees pursuing qualifications in leadership and 

management. 

At Civmec, we are fortunate to have a significant 

number of employees who have been with the 

business for many years, including some since 

its inception. This is testament to Civmec’s ability 

to provide people with viable career pathways to 

nurture a sustainable career, developing and growing 

with the company.

DIVERSITY &amp; 

 EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

DIVERSITY

Our commitment to driving diversity in the workplace is founded on 

a belief that a more balanced workforce, across age, gender and 

ethnicity, positively contributes to our culture and makes Civmec a 

more attractive place to work for all employees.

As we continue to strive for a supportive and inclusive workplace for 

all people, we are focused on actively capitalising on the diversity 

of skills, talents and perspectives of our people to harness an 

organisation where everyone works better together and feels valued 

and able to contribute. Across our entire operations, 8.3% of all 

employees are female.

As is typical of organisations in our industry, the ability to achieve a 

diverse workforce in the corporate environment is much easier than 

achieving this balance in operations and project delivery, particularly 

given our vast self-performance capability. It is extremely challenging 

to attract females into these roles, given the nature of the work we do 

across traditionally male-dominated trades and disciplines.

From a head office perspective, we have a much higher female 

participation rate, at 49.65%. Therefore, our continued focus remains 

at the grass-roots level, encouraging female apprentices to grow their 

career with Civmec, with two female apprentices working with us and 

one of our four trainees being female. Going forward, we will continue 

to identify and support suitable candidates to join us in trade and 

operations roles onsite and in our manufacturing facilities. 

In the future there may be an opportunity to improve the composition 

of our Board, with the future appointment of a female member. 

Notwithstanding this, there is regular participation at Board meetings 

of other senior managers from across the business, including a 

number of women. At the Key Management Personnel/General 

Managers/Group Managers level, women hold 22.2% of positions. 

The following tables demonstrate the breakdown of our employee 

categories by gender  and age, reflecting the Australian Government’s 

Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) reporting categories.

ABORIGINAL ENGAGEMENT 

Our ongoing commitment to building sustainable relationships with 

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) people and their communities 

remains a priority. We continue to provide employment and training 

opportunities for ATSI people across our business, again focused at the 

grassroots level, with 9% of participants in our apprenticeship program 

of ATSI descent.

We are also committed to utilising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 

businesses for supply and subcontract opportunities. We are seeing this 

as an increased area of engagement and fulfilment of commitment, as 

more ATSI businesses are establishing and gaining experience.

NON-DISCRIMINATION 

We monitor the number of filed, addressed and resolved grievances 

regarding labour practices. Civmec’s confidential whistleblowing line

MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING 

Recognising the importance of mental health has been a focus for Civmec. 

Civmec wants to ensure that we are providing a safe place of work and continued 

discussion around mental health, reducing the stigma and empowering our 

people. We have implemented strategies and activities that support our 

employees’ mental health and wellbeing, and assist them to support their 

colleagues. 

This was of particular importance with the commencement of the pandemic, and 

required a fast response across all operations by our Human Resources and HSE 

teams; both of whom responded quickly to the evolving situation.

Civmec is committed to the continual education and training of our people to 

assist and support them with their mental health and suicide prevention.

We will continue to drive best-practice in the way we manage our people going forward, with future focus on: 

•  continued commitment to leadership training, including identification of high potential individuals and succession planning;

•  implementation of a succession planning strategy focused on three key areas – executive management, key operational 

roles, and diversity targets; 

•  strengthening our position as an ‘employer of choice’ and adopting industry practices aligned with that of our competitors;

•  continued development of apprenticeship, traineeship and graduate programs; and

•  further strengthening our current mental health systems and initiatives to ensure mental health and wellbeing is a  

continued focus. 

Initiatives specifically focused on increasing female participation include: 

•  focused recruitment campaigns; 

•  reviewing occupations (including non-traditional female roles) which can provide a more flexible roster, including part-time 

and job sharing;

•  strengthening partnership programs with key stakeholders, including clients, community groups and job networks, providing 

the foundation skills required for employment in the resource industry or pathways to higher level qualifications; and

•  increasing opportunities through our RTO, with personalised training programs that provide flexibility and ease of  

access, which remove the barriers that discourage women from gaining the skills and knowledge required to enter our 

industry sectors.

HEALTH &amp; 

SAFETY 

Continual and sustained improvement in health and safety has been a major focus for 

the business throughout the year. Our commitment to continual improvement means we 

are always seeking opportunities to innovate and learn from our experience. 

Driven by our executive, operational and 

project leaders, there has been ongoing drive 

to continually enhance the positive safety 

culture throughout the business in line with 

the Never Assume principles. This is achieved 

by providing a framework for the behavioural 

expectations of our people across the business 

and incorporating the core values in how we 

operate. Our health and safety performance 

and continued focus on the wellbeing of our 

people is critical to our business success and 

sustainability. 

Throughout the year we have invested in the 

development of our people, in particular our leaders, 

with the ongoing learning packages provided as part 

of our LEAD Program. This program consists of four 

nationally accredited units covering risk management, 

communication, leadership and supervision of onsite 

operations, and provides our leaders with the skills 

to better plan, risk assess, communicate, support 

and utilise our business systems and processes. 

With these ongoing learning and development 

opportunities, we will continue to drive our safety 

culture, systems, planning and risk management to 

deliver improved health and safety outcomes for our 

people, clients and delivery partners.

We have continued to incorporate our Critical Safety 

Essentials into how we operate as a business. The 

way we manage safety starts with the Critical Safety 

Essentials and every employee is expected to abide 

by these underlying rules, which form the foundation 

of how we operate. 

During FY2020, a number of proactive initiatives were 

implemented to support continual improvement in our 

safety performance towards a best practice model, 

including:

•  achieving industry benchmark external 

accreditation to ISO 45001:2018 to supersede 

existing OHSAS 18001:2007 accreditation, 

including an increased focus on psychosocial 

hazard management;

•  the development and implementation of 

Job Demand Assessments (JDA) in the pre-

employment process, and training and awareness 

programs for work-related activities and general 

health and wellbeing;

•  reduced workers compensation exposure by 

improving the analysis and review process 

associated with pre-employment medical screening 

for prospective employees; 

•  developing and promoting injury prevention and 

management strategies to reduce musculoskeletal 

injuries through timely reporting, early intervention 

and the facilitation of expedited, durable return to 

work plans in collaboration with health providers 

and rehabilitation services;

•  software upgrades to enable the formalisation of 

the mobile/tablet-based inspection and reporting 

program;

•  hand injury prevention initiatives, including 

engineering controls specifically designed around 

prevention/minimisation of hand injuries throughout 

our operations; and

•  a number of behaviour-based safety program 

initiatives to shape the behaviours and actions of 

individuals and improve team culture.

Our health and safety management system has recently 

been certified to ISO 45001:2018 (the new internationally 

recognised standard for health and safety management) 

for three years. Our management system is based on 

the principles of risk management, with the system 

providing a broad set of requirements to support our 

wide-ranging scope of business activities. Civmec’s 

executive and senior management remain committed to 

continually enhancing safety performance throughout 

the company’s operations.

Our Never Assume program, incorporating our core values, 

provides a framework for the behavioural expectations of 

our people across the business, in order to build a strong 

and sustainable safety culture. The program is designed to 

empower every person in the company to ensure their work 

practices are focused on achieving a safe work environment, 

reinforcing the right and responsibility of every employee to 

stop work and intervene if they see an unsafe act, condition 

or behaviour and be part of the solution. Throughout the

Our company operates under a continual improvement model, and an 

increased focus on HSE and field leadership across the business has 

led to improvements in our risk management approach in a dynamic and 

constantly changing environment.

As an evolving and diversified business, we strive for effectiveness in our health 

and safety systems, continuously updating and improving system documents, 

procedures and processes, working towards a best practice model. 

FY2020 was, again, a busy year for Civmec, having worked approximately 

2,800,000 hours (including contractors) with the majority of hours accumulated in 

environments of work considered to be of higher risk. During FY2020, we had a 

reduction in our All Injury Frequency Rate (AIFR), which records all injuries requiring 

at least first aid treatment, to 30.13 per million hours worked, a reduction from 

42.86 in 2019. However, we noted a slight increase in our lost time injury frequency 

rate (LTIFR) to 0.36, also based on one million hours worked.

Over the reporting period for all injuries, the most commonly injured body parts 

were hand/fingers which equated to 29% of all injuries, followed by hips, legs and 

ankles at 20%, back injuries at 12% and shoulder, arm and wrist injuries at 10%. 

There has been a concerted effort by the business during the reporting period to 

continue to drive strong field leadership and proactive leading indicators, such as 

hazard reporting, workplace inspections and behavioural safety observations. This 

continues to be a major focus for the business and this approach will assist with a 

sustained reduction in recordable injuries across the business over the longer term.

Our safety performance across key metrics is outlined in the tables below:

The principal area of recordable injuries was open wounds, which is consistent 

with industry trends for predominantly manual work undertaken in the engineering 

and construction environment. We are continuing to review trends and implement 

proactive initiatives aimed at reducing the incident and severity of these types of 

injuries. It should be noted that 15% of recordable injuries were from contractor 

employees.

Both health and wellbeing have a significant impact 

on an employee’s safety at work. We understand 

that injury prevention is critical to improving overall 

wellbeing. 

Given the nature of Civmec’s work, many employees 

engage in manual or repetitive tasks and, as such, 

may be at risk of degenerative injuries over time. 

To mitigate this, during FY2020 we developed 

and implemented new and updated Job Demand 

Assessments (JDAs) to assist with the pre-

employment assessment of new employees, along 

with a more comprehensive review of the completed 

assessments where concerns are identified. Not 

only will this assist with pre-emptive management of 

musculoskeletal injuries, it will also allow us to identify 

high risk candidates prior to engagement. This has 

been complemented by proactive manual handling/

ergonomic training programs being run on some 

of our sites that involve heavy manual work. In the 

event of a musculoskeletal event occurring we have 

engaged in early intervention of medical treatment 

associated with these types of injuries and improved 

the proactive management of those injuries, which 

has seen a reduction in the length and severity of 

related worker’s compensation claims. 

While the reduction in physical injuries has been a 

focus throughout the year, we also increased our 

focus on the mental health and wellbeing initiatives 

across the business. 

The Blue Tree initiative was introduced across our 

facilities and projects to promote the message “It is 

OK to not be OK” and to remind all of our employees 

of the importance of speaking up and seeking help 

when it is needed. 

As we headed into FY2021, we also conducted a 

review of the mental health programs across the 

business, which included an increased assessment of 

psychosocial hazards and subsequent management, 

introduction of Mental Health First Aid training, 

promotion and active involvement in R U OK? Day 

and an increase in toolbox awareness training around 

men’s and women’s health, staying mentally healthy 

and maintaining physical and mental health. 

In the second half of FY2020, the global pandemic 

COVID-19 presented some challenges relating to 

our employees’ health and wellbeing. Our business 

implemented various control measures to mitigate the 

impacts and to ensure the safety and welfare of our 

employees was at the forefront of the management 

of this. The impact of COVID-19 was significant for 

some of our eastern states based employees, who 

were not able to return home. We maintained regular 

contact with these employees and provided them with 

support mechanisms, such as:

• sending care packages to the families of our east

coast and New Zealand employees, consisting of

individual gifts and hampers that were personalised

to their situations; and

•  HR making contact with all of our eastern states

employees and their families where possible to

“check in” on them and offering access to our

Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for team

members and their families.

SAFETY PERFORMANCE



Building on the improvements achieved and initiatives implemented in FY2020, we will continue to adopt a strong, proactive 

approach going forward, driving ongoing improvements to our Safety Management System. In order to achieve this, we will 

focus on the following key areas in FY2021:

•  formulation of a Mental Health Strategy for 2021-2024, including training programs, industry partnerships, pre-emptive 

initiatives, risk assessments, and auditing programs; 

•  implementing a comprehensive manual handling and ergonomics program on our operational sites, focusing on field 

assessments to evaluate body positioning, manual task assessment and musculoskeletal risk, with the program to include 

training in both theoretical and practical components; and

•  continuing to develop and train our people in company specific Hazard Identification Risk Assessment and Control (HIRAC) 

and management of change through interactive training sessions incorporating behavioural safety elements.   

We will continue to maintain a strong focus on safety, as a critical element of our ongoing business improvement model being 

applied throughout the business.

OUR FUTURE FOCUS

The health and wellbeing of all of our employees is supported in 

various ways across the business, with key initiatives including:

•  an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) available to employees 

and their families, providing confidential counselling as well as 

access to dieticians and financial counselling specialists;

•  early intervention programs such as drug and alcohol testing, and 

a zero tolerance to the presence of these substances at work;

•  prevention programs including health assessments and  

pre-employment screening;

•  access to education programs specifically developed to support 

those with supervisory, or leadership responsibilities;

•  benefits such as discounts on gym membership, health 

insurance, financial advisory services and travel.

All of the above are supported by our onsite medical facility and 

injury management services, promoting active lifestyle programs 

and assist employees with both work-related and non-work-related 

injuries and illnesses to enable their return to work.

ENVIRONMENT

Strong environmental performance is essential to the ongoing success, 

growth and sustainability of our company. Promoting an environmentally 

aware culture through training and communication; demonstrating 

leadership and commitment to applying best-practice in environmental 

management across our operations; and continually improving our 

environmental performance and efficiency, is fundamental to our business 

strategy and operating method.

By delivering a strong environmental performance we in turn 

benefit our clients, the communities we operate in and the 

environment. Our environmental commitments are articulated 

in our Environmental Policy.

During FY2020 we continued to implement initiatives to drive 

environmental best-practice at our fabrication and assembly facilities 

in Perth and Newcastle and across our project sites, in support of 

the key items identified in the ‘Future Focus’ section of our 2019 

Sustainability Report. These included:

•  promoting an environmentally aware culture through ongoing

training and communication across all levels of the business;

•  ongoing systems review and improvement;

•  improving efficiency through innovation – energy intensity and

emissions intensity were reduced by 26% and 40% respectively

in FY2020 compared to the previous year; and

•  further developing and implementing our waste management

strategy – waste sent to landfill has decreased by 21% in

FY2020 compared to the previous year.

Heavy engineering and construction require high energy 

inputs and, therefore, it is imperative we have access to a 

reliable, affordable and efficient energy supply. 

We acknowledge the scientific consensus on climate change and 

accept we must play our part in reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 

emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, as signed by Australia 

and its fellow signatories. 

Climate uncertainty presents many known, and many still unknown, 

challenges to the global environment, its communities and our 

business, which need to be identified and understood. We will 

continue to include these factors in our risk profile, ensuring any 

material impacts and opportunities are continually assessed and 

mitigated accordingly. It should be noted, that within our industry a 

changing climate may also present opportunities, such as the likely 

investment required to improve and build climate change related 

infrastructure around the world. 

OUR ENERGY

At present, 100% of our electricity consumption at our 

manufacturing/production facilities is sourced from local electricity 

networks in Western Australia and New South Wales. Energy 

consumed at our projects is difficult to accurately measure due to 

the various project arrangements in often remote locations, and 

therefore it is not included in this report.

Most of the energy usage at our facilities is attributed to electricity 

consumed through the fabrication process, comprising handling, 

cutting, bending, welding, drilling, assembling and coating our 

products. In addition to this, electricity is consumed to heat, cool, 

light and provide general power to our corporate and manufacturing 

facilities. We also consume fuels and gases to power machinery and 

equipment, with some gases consumed through the welding and 

cutting processes. 

To allow us to measure and compare the energy intensity of our 

fabrication facilities over time, we measure our total energy input 

in Terajoules (TJ) per million dollars of turnover ($m AUD). 

During FY2020, Civmec facilities consumed a total of 27.82 TJ, 

which is a decrease of 17% when compared to FY2019 levels.  

Our focus on efficiency through innovation is a driving factor behind 

this improvement. With reduced manual and material handling, 

materials tracking and traceability, advanced automation, increased 

in-house modularisation and commissioning and with an ongoing 

focus on training our local workforce, we believe we will continue to 

improve our efficiency over time.

OUR EMISSIONS

During FY2020, our facilities achieved a decrease in Scope 1 emissions by 45% 

and an increase in Scope 2 emissions by 12%.  

To allow us to measure and compare the emissions intensity of our facilities over 

time, we measure the CO2 emitted in tonnes (tCO2e) per million dollars of turnover 

($m AUD). In FY2020, our emissions intensity decreased by 40% when compared 

to FY2019 levels.

We have continued to invest in and develop both our Henderson and Newcastle 

facilities, with completion of our new Assembly Hall in Henderson achieved in 

FY2020. We will begin collecting energy data in FY2021 for at least 12 months 

to understand what our energy profile looks like. This data will then guide us in 

determining the most suitable energy efficient systems to invest in to meet our 

future requirements. 

Our ongoing strategy with respect to reducing our overall GHG emissions 

and emissions intensity shall be delivered through our investment in and 

implementation of our efficiency programs. 

The table below illustrates our facilities’ energy and emissions data (Henderson 

and Newcastle), including:

•  energy data which includes diesel, petrol, electricity, LPG and welding gas;

•  Scope 1 emissions comprising diesel, petrol, LPG and acetylene;

•  Scope 2 emissions comprising our purchased electricity; and

•  emissions intensity measuring Scope 1 and Scope 2 against turnover.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY



ENERGY EFFICIENCY AT OUR NEW 

ASSEMBLY HALL 

In February 2020, we achieved structural completion of our 

new Assembly Hall in Henderson. Standing at 70 metres 

high, the mega-structure was sustainably designed to be 

innovative and efficient, with a number of principles identified 

that would reduce emissions and operational running costs.  

LIGHTING

Careful consideration was given to lighting in the facility, in 

order to provide the most effective lighting for operations 

whilst also minimising power consumption and emissions. 

Key lighting efficiencies include: 

•  the installation of LED lighting throughout the building,

providing a longer life-cycle than traditional halogen

or  fluorescent options, and also a lower wattage,

thus reducing energy usage and CO2 emissions to the

environment;

•  the incorporation of motion-sensored lighting to further

increase the efficiency of the LED lights – stairwells and

bathrooms all have motion-activated lighting, which turns

on only when someone enters and turns off after a period

of inactivity;

•  the programming of office lighting and air conditioning

on automatic timers to prevent either being left on

overnight.

ESCALATORS

Escalators in the building have also been fitted with motion 

sensors, saving energy by reducing the speed in which they 

run during inactivity.

MONITORING

Monitoring of energy efficiency in the new Assembly Hall 

will be undertaken over a 12-month period to determine 

consumption and performance levels in order to provide us 

with key areas of focus and drive continuous improvement in 

the efficiency and sustainability of our facilities.

Global waste pollution is a significant environmental issue. 

Producing waste is an outcome of the industry in which we 

operate, and therefore we accept we have a role to play 

in reducing our impact. Our waste management strategy 

consists of the following:

•  to continually raise awareness across the business and improve

the culture of how we view waste management and recycling;

•  to reduce our own waste and waste within the supply chain

with a focus on packaging; and

•  to capture all recyclable materials and reduce waste going

to landfill.

The waste data included in the following table relates to our two 

manufacturing facilities in Henderson and Newcastle. Obtaining 

accurate waste management data for projects is difficult, due to 

some projects having their waste managed by the client or owner. 

Civmec facilities do not discharge any waste materials to the 

environment. All waste materials are contained and removed from 

site for further processing. 

All waste data included in this report has been provided by the 

relevant waste service providers.

Note: These significant improvements were achieved with similar quantities of steel processed by weight in 

FY2019 and FY2020 (-0.54% reduction in FY2020, compared to FY2019). 

TRADE WASTE LICENSE

We utilise a trade waste license to discharge quantities of treated 

wash water into the sewerage network from the Henderson 

maintenance and logistics workshop. Wastewater is created from 

the washing down of equipment using a high-pressure washer that 

may contain oils and grease. This water is passed through an oily 

water separator and then discharged into the network for further 

treatment. 

Wastewater is tested annually for Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons, 

as per the license conditions. The results for FY2020 were below 

the acceptance criteria.

SPILLS

Due to the nature of our work and the type of equipment we operate, occasionally 

minor hydrocarbon and chemical spills do occur. 

Hydrocarbon and chemical spills affect the environment in different ways 

depending on the type and volume of material spilt and the receiving environment. 

If a spill clean-up is managed effectively, the exposure to personnel and 

environmental damage is minimised. 

To minimise the risk of impacting the surrounding environment we shall continue to 

implement our operational controls. We believe the best form of spill management 

is spill prevention and it is the responsibility of all personnel to ensure they are 

aware of and comply with all company and regulatory requirements. To support 

this, we undertake regular spill training sessions with our people.

CIVMEC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  2020

EFFLUENTS &amp; WASTE



To drive ongoing improvement in our performance, we shall continue to implement our 

environmental programs across the business, focusing on:

•  continuing to promote an environmentally aware culture through ongoing training and

communication to all levels of the business;

•  continually improving our environmental management systems and achieving ongoing

compliance with our legal and other commitments across all Civmec facilities and projects sites,

to be verified through our scheduled corporate auditing program;

•  continuing to focus on improving efficiency through innovation, measured via efficiency

indicators such as energy intensity (TJ/$m AUD) and emissions intensity (tCO2-e/$m AUD); and

•  further developing and implementing our waste management strategy, with the aim of increasing

year on year the proportion of co-mingled and wood recyclable waste streams compared to the

general waste stream.

We believe that by delivering on these key focus areas, we will achieve our long-term sustainability 

goals, delivering valuable outcomes for the environment and our stakeholders.

OUR FUTURE FOCUS

There were no significant or reportable spills during FY2020.

GOVERNANCE

Civmec’s Board and management are committed to maintaining a high 

standard of governance and ethics. They recognise the importance of 

good governance in ensuring transparency and protecting the interests 

of shareholders, as well as strengthening investors’ confidence in the 

management of all aspects of the company’s operations.

The Board and Executives promote high standards of 

corporate behaviour and, as a dual-listed company, 

endorse both the SGX Principles of the Code of Corporate 

Governance and the ASX Corporate Governance Principles 

and Recommendations. Civmec’s Report on Corporate 

Governance for the year ending 30 June 2020 (in which  

we report against these principles) is included in our 2020 

Annual Report, available on our website. 

To assist in the execution of its responsibilities, the Board has 

established several Board Committees, including an Audit 

Committee, Nominating Committee, Remuneration Committee 

and Risks and Conflicts Committee. 

These Committees function within clearly defined terms of reference 

and operating procedures, which are reviewed on a regular basis. 

Our Code of Conduct sets the standard of behaviour which guides 

how we act when performing our work, how we make decisions and 

against which we can measure our performance and hold ourselves 

accountable. The Code comprises principles that apply in various 

aspects of our working environment, including how we interact with 

colleagues and how we engage third parties to perform work for us 

or to represent us.

ASSESSMENT PROCESSES

All of the company’s legal entities have been 

assessed by their management teams regarding 

the implementation of anti-corruption practices and 

incidents of corruption. 

All new major suppliers are required to comply with 

the Supplier Code of Conduct, committing to respect 

our zero-tolerance policy concerning bribery and 

corruption. Suppliers must have systems in place to 

ensure the proper instruction, training, and auditing of 

personnel and subcontractors to ensure compliance. 

We perform supplier audits and evaluations to 

monitor and assess compliance with the company’s 

requirements and the Code of Conduct. Suppliers 

are obliged to immediately inform us of any known 

violations of the Code of Conduct.

Corruption risks are investigated as part of the 

ongoing internal auditing of the company. If corruption 

is suspected, the HR Business Unit together with 

Executive Management, and possibly other business 

units, will carry out an investigation, with the help 

of specialised third parties, if necessary. The Risks 

and Conflicts Committee assesses the findings of 

the investigation and orders disciplinary or other 

measures against culpable employees, which may 

also lead to the termination of employment and/or the 

termination of contracts with business partners, or to 

such contracts not being extended or changed for 

precautionary reasons. To prevent corruption risks, we 

undertake business reviews of high-risk business in 

high-risk environments with high-risk customers. 

COMMUNICATION &amp; TRAINING

Our approach to anti-corruption is based on the 

Code of Conduct, which clearly prohibits bribery and 

corruption. Compliance with the Code of Conduct, 

as an integral part of the employment contract and 

the onboarding program, is the personal responsibility 

of each Civmec employee. Corporate Legal, Internal 

Audit and Corporate Compliance teams regularly 

conduct training sessions and audits. Executive 

General Managers and Business Unit Managers are 

responsible for the compliance of their departments 

with applicable laws, internal regulations, including the 

Code of Conduct, and for the information and training 

of their staff. 

We regularly conduct formal training in proactive 

avoidance of possible violations against the Code of 

Conduct, both with e-learnings and with classroom-

based (face-to-face) courses. Training is group-

specific, based on cases, and modern training tools 

are used (multi-media). Participation is mandatory for 

all employees in relevant roles. 

RECORDED INCIDENTS

Adoption of and compliance with the Code of 

Conduct by the General Managers and their 

management teams was reviewed in 2020. 

Our employees are the most effective channel to 

detect violation, underlining transparency as a key 

value at Civmec which must be supported and 

preserved.

PURPOSE

We operate in a number of different geographical regions and in differing market 

sectors. This involves dealing with customers, competitors, suppliers, and various 

other stakeholders. It is critical for our ongoing sustainability that the company 

conducts its operations in compliance with laws and business practices, including, 

but not limited to, those related to anti-competitive behaviours. 

We are committed to conducting our operations with integrity and in a manner that 

is consistent with laws and business practices that are aimed at fostering an open, 

competitive and fair market environment and which will best serve the long-term 

interests of our customers, our stakeholders and the wider community. 

We are committed to dealing fairly and honestly with our customers, suppliers, 

competitors and any other business partners and the community (collectively 

‘stakeholders’), and observing relevant legislation, regulation, contractual 

obligations and our corporate policies – in particular the provisions of the 

Competition and Consumer Act (‘CCA’), and the Australian Consumer Law (‘ACL’).

GUIDELINES

The key guidelines which govern our approach to anti-competitive behaviour are 

as follows:

1.  The CCA governs anti-competitive and unfair behaviours. It is regulated by the 

Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (‘ACCC’).

2.  Our corporate policies prohibit entry by any person representing Civmec  

into any arrangements which are illegal under the CCA, have the purpose or  

(in some cases) the effect of substantially lessening competition, or breach  

the ACL.

3.  We predominantly operate under the provisions of the CCA and ensure 

compliance with this Act (amongst others). This includes the prohibition of 

behaviours such as: 

 

a)  agreements between competitors to fix, maintain or control prices;

 

b)  agreements between competitors to split up a market or customer 

agreements between competitors not to deal with particular suppliers, 

customers or other competitors;

 

c)  conduct that is prohibited if it has the purpose or effect of substantially 

lessening competition as defined under the CCA, which may include, 

depending on circumstances, exclusive dealing and other restrictive 

arrangements;

 

d)  the supply of goods or services on condition that the customer purchases 

goods or services from a third party; and

 

e)  inducing resellers to not sell products below a specified price. 

4.  We also prohibit agreements, arrangements or understandings that have 

the purpose, effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition in a 

market.

CIVMEC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  2020

ANTI-COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOUR

in FY2020 in relation to anti-competitive behaviour and 

violations of anti-trust and monopoly legislation.

Furthermore, to date, Civmec has never received or been 

the subject of any legal action in relation to anti-competitive 

behaviour and violations of anti-trust and monopoly 

legislation.

POLICY COMPLIANCE

Failure to comply with the policy in relation to anti-competitive behaviour may result 

in substantial fines and penalties being imposed upon Civmec and may expose 

the company and/or its employees to civil or criminal liability or other financial or 

reputational damage. It may put our business licences at risk. Employees who 

breach the policy may face disciplinary action including dismissal. 

The Executive General Manager – Operational Support is responsible for 

implementation of Civmec’s competition law compliance. This is critical to the 

business for a number of reasons, including:

•  failure to comply with competition rules can have an extremely high financial 

cost with regards to fines from the Australian Government;

•  any agreement that infringes competition law may be wholly or partially invalid, 

which means that the company cannot enforce it;

•  third parties who suffer loss as a result of anti-competitive behaviour may be 

able to claim damages from Civmec for their loss;

•  investigations into the company and findings of infringements attract adverse 

media comment; and

•  investigations and possible legal proceedings resulting from infringements can 

take years to resolve, incurring high costs and taking up management time that 

should be devoted to more profitable projects. 

We encourage our staff to be vigilant and proactive in circumstances where 

they have concerns about conduct that may breach the CCA, and encourage 

employees to escalate any such concerns they might have to their line manager or 

the Executive General Manager – Operational Support.

LOCAL INDUSTRY PARTICIPATION

Civmec provides full, fair and reasonable opportunity for local 

industry to take part in all its activities. This maximises participation 

where subcontractors and suppliers are capable and competitive on 

the basis of OHS, environment, quality, delivery and value-for-money 

standards. 

Our Local Industry Participation (LIP) Policy articulates our approach 

to driving opportunities for local participation, including:

•  developing project specific LIP plans;

•  providing early and fair opportunities to all local industries;

•  developing a communications strategy for local industry so 

that they are informed at the earliest opportunity of upcoming 

subcontractor/supply opportunities;

•  ensuring local capabilities are considered when planning work 

scope to optimise opportunities for local businesses;

•  providing training and development opportunities for local 

providers in order to enhance their sustainability;

•  giving preference to tenderers that use the greatest local content 

in labour and materials; and

•  working with government, industry bodies and communities 

to improve local industry participation, capability and 

competitiveness.

PURPOSE

Civmec understands that taxes are an important source of government revenue 

and a key mechanism by which organisations contribute to the countries in which 

they operate.

The majority of our operations in FY2020 were conducted in Australia. 

We are committed to complying with relevant tax legislation for the regions we 

operate in, and fulfilling all fiscal obligations with integrity and transparency.  

This will ensure a fair contribution is made to the local economy, and to meet the 

expectations of our customers, stakeholders, and the wider community. 

GUIDELINES

The key guidelines which govern our approach to tax include:

•  ensuring we remain familiar with all tax reporting and payment obligations within 

our jurisdiction;

•  declaring all assessable income and allowable deductions;

•  participating only in legitimate tax planning;

• where necessary, obtaining the advice of professionals and experts; and

•  making ourselves available to the tax authorities at all times, and responding  

to any requests in a timely manner.



47

CIVMEC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  2020

TAX



Civmec will continue to advocate good corporate governance 

and high standards of integrity and ethics across our 

operations, driven by the actions and behaviours of our 

people. This is underpinned by our Code of Conduct, which 

will continue to be reviewed and evolved going forward, to 

meet the expectations of our business, our stakeholders and 

the communities in which we operate.
