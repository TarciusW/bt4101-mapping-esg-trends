Grandness is to consistently upgrade the internal data 

collection procedure and gradually expand the scope of 

disclosure.

BoArD stAtement

For Sino Grandness, sustainability hinges on coordinated 

development encompassing issues related to society, 

economy, culture, resources, the environment and 

lifestyle. Climate change is likely to have considerable 

direct and indirect impacts on food safety, placing 

public health at risk. In response to this significant and 

scientifically backed issue, the Group adopts a people-

centric approach towards sustainability by putting the 

interests of customers, employees and the environment 

first.

While we commit ourselves to compliance with laws and 

regulations and fulfilment of regulatory requirements, we 

acknowledge that it is just the beginning of our pursuit 

of sustainability. The Group has in place an established 

framework that studies and assesses the potential risks 

brought by issues related to sustainability. Measures 

and solutions are delivered through discussions in the 

management level. We are confident that this mechanism 

can help us rise above the competition in an ever changing 

environment.

To effectively manage the implementation of sustainability 

policies, each department is tasked with monitoring the 

execution of new policies, predicting potential challenges 

and reporting findings to the management and observing 

macroscopic trends that could be relevant to us. Through 

regular communication, the management closely follows 

the environmental and social performance of the whole 

group and guides the Group as a whole towards its set 

targets in an established, systematic manner.

Stakeholder engagement is an essential process in the 

achievement of sustainability in line with transparency 

and ethical principles. To understand the views and 

expectations of internal and external stakeholders, we 

commissioned a consultant to conduct stakeholder 

engagement in the form of survey and management 

interview. Continuous collection of feedback allows us 

to regularly review and adjust the implementation of 

sustainability measures and policies to fulfill the needs 

of stakeholders. 

Sustainability is at the core of the national development 

strategy of China where our business is situated. In the 

future, the Group will continue to pay close attention to 

the country’s sustainable development strategy and invest 

in meticulous compliance with laws and regulations, in 

order to accomplish a progressive sustainability vision for 

the benefit of society.

engAgement

The Board of Directors of Sino Grandness takes sustainability issues in consideration as part of its strategic formulation 

and reviews management performance. To assist the Board of Directors in carrying out its principal functions, the 

Board of Directors is supported by the Audit Committee, the Nominating Committee and Remuneration Committee. 

The Group’s CSR policy continues to guide the review of the Group’s policies, standards and impacts with regard to 

environmental and social issues; as well as key stakeholders such as regulators, suppliers, customers and employees.  

The Group’s subsidiary, Garden Fresh Group, is a member of Shenzhen Agriculture Industrialization Association. 

Sino Grandness’ canned products are compliant with international standards, including the Hazard Analysis and Critical 

Control Point (“HACCP”) food safety system, British Retail Consortium (“BRC”), International Food Standard (“IFS”) and 

International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) certifications. With these qualifications, the Group’s canned 

products can be exported to overseas customers including the European Union, which has strict import requirement 

for food product in the aspects of environmental and food safety.  

The Group is in the process of setting up a Sustainability Committee to better respond to the socio-environmental 

challenges. 

As a key in the management of Sino Grandness, stakeholder2  participation helps the Group review potential risks and 

business opportunities. Communicating with stakeholders and understanding their views allow the Group to better 

fulfil their needs and expectations with its business practice and manage different stakeholders’ opinions. 

The Group constantly communicates with key internal and external stakeholders via various channels. This ensures 

that they have the opportunity to learn about the Group’s development and operation directions. It also offers the

sustAinABility risks 

AnD oPPortunities

With regard to the material sustainability issues identified from the stakeholder engagement exercise, the Group has 

identified the following risks and opportunities.  





























risks

resPonses/ oPPortunities

ProDuct resPonsiBilities  

The Group is subject to laws and regulations 

concerning product safety and health of the target 

market. Since the Group serves a diverse customer 

base across Asia and Europe, it is a priority to 

observe the applicable laws and regulations. Product 

defect and product safety issues may lead to loss 

of customer trust. Non-compliance with regulatory 

standards may result in lengthy litigation, monetary 

and non-monetary sanctions, and threaten business 

reputation.

ProDuct quAlity control

Across the Group, various departments, such as the Procurement 

Department and the Quality Control Department are responsible for 

monitoring product quality according to the policies and procedures 

established by the Group. For instance, the “Quality and Safety Management 

Manual” was in place to guide employees to ensure hygiene conditions 

are in compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Applicable to both 

existing products and the development of new products, responsible 

personnel also follow the “Quality and Safety Management Manual” in 

identifying, assessing and managing potential food safety risks.

As part of its established procedures in product quality control, the Quality 

Control Department is responsible for sampling and inspecting each lot of 

outbound goods to ensure that the quality and hygiene conditions fulfil the 

Group’s criteria before distribution. In addition, the Group has in a place 

an “Unsafe food recall management system”, through which the Group 

would report any unsafe cases to local regulatory agencies, and recall the 

products.    

customer PrivAcy

With growing attention to the handling of customer 

data, the Group continues to enhance data 

governance to safeguard the customer data it 

collects from customers and suppliers in its business 

activities. Loss of data and breach of customer 

privacy can result in erosion of customer trust and 

reputation.

DAtA Protection meAsures

The Group has implemented a set of measures to protect customer privacy, 

such as setting standard practices for employees to follow, providing 

awareness training and enhancing data security system.

occuPAtionAl hAzArDs

Without proper management, workers at production 

facilities may be exposed to occupational hazards 

ranging from operation of machines to use of 

chemicals, 

compromising 

employee 

wellbeing 

and productivity. Non-compliance with regulatory 

requirements on health and safety may also result 

in fines and non-financial sanctions which impact 

operations and affect reputation.

sAfety mAnAgement system

The Safety and Environmental Department has the oversight of identification 

of safety hazards, and implementation of safety inspection, accident 

investigation and mitigation measures. Safety guidelines and training are 

provided to employees. The Group can implement safety management 

systems to control the risks associated with occupational hazards.

Recruiting and retaining qualified and highly skilled 

employees is a constant challenge presented to the 

manufacturing industry.

DeveloPment

A fair employment system and, learning and development opportunities 

are key drivers of an engaged and talented workforce. In conjunction with 

the Group’s policies and plans on employee training and development, 

the management identifies training needs, formulates training plans 

and evaluates training effectiveness on an annual basis. Employees 

are encouraged to participate in external training courses for career 

development.

sociAlly resPonsiBle conDuct

Employment malpractice, such as discrimination, 

harassment, child labour and forced labour, and 

accompanying negative publicity can pose threat to 

employee morale and customer trust. In the event 

of socioeconomic non-compliance with laws and 

regulations, businesses may suffer from lengthy 

litigations, monetary sanctions and reputation 

erosion. 

mAnAgement oversight in sustAinABility

The Group is aware of its obligation to comply with applicable regulatory 

requirements. The Group will consider setting up an active monitoring 

system to observe changing social norms, legal requirements, and 

administrative regulations in different areas of operations. 

The Board of Directors will continue to take sustainability issues into 

consideration as part of its strategic formulation, so as to provide timely 

response to changing needs of the stakeholders and local communities, 

and ensure socially responsible conduct of the Group.

Pollution AnD environmentAl 

contAminAtion

The Group is subject to laws and regulations 

concerning water and effluents. Taking into account 

its business nature, the Group operates with a 

latent risk of contamination in the surrounding 

environment and communities. Environmental 

non-compliance may result in monetary and non-

monetary sanctions. Tightening regulatory controls 

entail investments in cleaner production process 

and effective treatment of effluent and waste. 

Pollution control system

The Group has been proactively managing the potential pollution and 

adverse environmental impact of its production. We ensure the quality of 

effluent is in compliance with regulatory requirements through on-going 

monitoring and third-party testing. In addition to articulating an emergency 

response plan, we constantly communicate with the community in which 

we operate.

Tightening regulatory standards on GHG emissions 

or the introduction of carbon tax may pose 

regulatory risks to the Group.

energy efficiency 

Considering that energy use is the primary source of GHG emissions of the 

Group, it endeavours to enhance energy efficiency to reduce its operating 

costs and GHG emissions.

The Group may benefit from opportunities created by new energy sources 

around the operation areas, and be able to utilize policy incentives for 

energy efficiency and renewable energy.
