SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021

Yongmao Holdings Limited (“Yongmao” or the “Company”) and our subsidiaries (collectively known as the “Group”) have designed, 

developed and manufactured a wide range of tower cranes, components and accessories since 1992. The Group sells its products 

mainly to construction equipment distributors and equipment rental companies in overseas markets and in the People’s Republic of 

China (the “PRC”). Our tower cranes are now exported to over 80 countries around the world, including to the USA and Russia. With 

a stringent quality assurance system in place, we are generally able to deliver a tower crane within 30 to 90 days. Our tower cranes 

are classified into four main series, namely the ST series, Topless STT series, Luffing STL series and Derrick Q series.

The Group’s two production facilities are mainly located in the PRC, namely in Fushun City of Liaoning Province. During the year 

ended 31 March 2021 (“FY2021”), the Group has recorded strong rebounds of order value and revenue, with our large and mega 

size tower cranes gaining increased traction in international markets.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021

This is the fourth Sustainability Report (the “report”) published by Yongmao. The Group discloses the policies, practices, targets and 

performance related to the material environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) topics that the Group has identified. 

REPORTING BOUNDARY

The report focuses on Yongmao’s operation of design, development, manufacture and sale of tower cranes, components and 

accessories between 1st April 2020 and 31st March 2021 (the “reporting year”, or FY2021). Similar to the Group’s previous 

sustainability reports, the reporting boundary for this report covers the Group’s two production facilities in Fushun City and the 

Beijing office in the PRC, as well as our Singapore office. 

We have completed the relocation of our Beijing production facility to Fushun City in September 2019. The new production facility is 

located in close proximity to the Group’s existing factory in Fushun, with land and built-up area approximately 160,000 and 35,000 

square metres respectively. 

The Group plans to gradually expand the scope of its disclosures in the coming reporting years to our sales and business rental 

operations located in Hong Kong.

REPORTING STANDARD

We have prepared this report in accordance with the “comply or explain” provision of the SGX-ST Listing Rules 711A and 711B on 

sustainability reporting, as well as the guidance set out in the Practice Note 7.6: Sustainability Reporting Guide (“PN 7.6”) issued by 

the SGX. It also takes reference from the sustainability reporting framework provided by Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”), the GRI 

Standards (version 2016 and 2018). The disclosures in this report seek to achieve the GRI’s Reporting Principles for Defining Report 

Quality - accuracy, balance, clarity, comparability, reliability, and timeliness.

Combined with the five material factors selected for reporting, we have also prepared additional GRI topic-specific disclosures for 

incorporation into the report. This would allow readers to have a deeper understanding of our material issues through quantitative 

data. The GRI-SGX Content Index is available at the end of this report.

CHAIRMAN’S

MESSAGE



“This year, we have insofar promoted many 

sustainable business practices across 

our various material issues. In terms of 

our procurement practices, the Group has 

fostered the support for local procurement 

and used locally sourced supplies in our 

production facilities.”



Mr Sun Zhao Lin

(Executive Chairman)

As we look back on 2021, it is an extraordinary year and still 

without a doubt that COVID-19 continues to impact societies 

and industries around the world. The unprecedented pandemic 

has incurred profound impact on our stakeholders, local 

communities, business partners and suppliers since it began. As 

the world talks of a sustainable and green recovery amidst the 

gradual reopening of borders, we have seen over 100 countries 

committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2050. For China, a 

key market in which we operate in, its government commits to 

reach the carbon neutral goal by 2060. We are delighted to see 

the world accelerating climate action as we prepare for the 26th 

United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) by the end 

of this year.

At Yongmao, ever since we started on our sustainability journey, 

we are committed to bring about our best efforts in improving 

corporate environmental performance, mitigating material 

risks, and capturing new sustainability opportunities, while 

simultaneously responding to the demands of our important 

stakeholders. This year, we have insofar promoted many 

sustainable business practices across our various material issues. 

In terms of our procurement practices, the Group has fostered the 

support for local procurement and used locally sourced supplies 

in our production facilities. Encountering COVID-19 and to ensure 

a safe working environment for our people, we have reinforced 

our health and safety guidelines to prevent the pandemic 

spread with safe distancing measures under the supervision 

of dedicated health taskforces. In addition, adopting innovative 

technologies and production methods to reduce environmental 

impacts and increase production efficiency will remain a critical 

area for Yongmao to focus on.

Despite the continued disruptions on business operations due 

to the pandemic, Yongmao is able to steer itself clear of difficult 

obstacles and achieve a robust financial rebound especially 

in the second half of this year. Even more so, we have posted 

a record high revenue and marked our first RMB1.0 billion 

breakthrough in revenue. This is an accomplishment attributable 

to our dedicated employees with an unrelenting company spirit 

to attain success in the face of immense uncertainties and the 

widespread pandemic. 

With our new Fushan Factory 2 commencing production, 

we are optimistic about the market outlook and Yongmao’s 

future. Likewise, we will continue to seize new sustainability 

opportunities, advance our established targets, and evaluate our 

strategic options to take on new challenges. As we mark our 

significant revenue milestone, it is crucial to remind ourselves 

that we have to remain as committed to our core values and 

sense of social responsibility.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021

SUSTAINABILITY RISKS

AND OPPORTUNITIES

Our Board provides overall guidance and is responsible for the sustainability direction of the Group. In practice, our senior 

management and departmental heads work in tandem with the Board in implementing the Group’s sustainability strategies and 

actions to ensure yearly sustainability targets can be achieved across our subsidiaries. 

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE

Yongmao’s Board is accountable for the Group’s overall business and sustainability direction, as well as long term value creation for 

the Group’s shareholders and investors. The various Board Committees such as the Audit Committee, Nominating Committee and 

Remuneration Committee, are delegated by the Board to consider relevant material issues and inform the Board for comprehensive 

business and sustainability strategy decision-making. 

SUSTAINABILITY RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES

Identifying and analyzing sustainability opportunities and risk is critical for the Group to make sound corporate decision-making. 

Through our risk management system and internal controls, we believe that identifying and appropriately managing risks related to 

sustainability topics helps us to be better prepared in tackling them effectively in the long run. The following table shows a myriad 

of sustainability risks and opportunities that have the potential to impact our long-term operations and strategy planning.

RISKS

OPPORTUNITIES AND RESPONSE

Economic Risks

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose 

business impacts onto our operations across 

geographies in FY2021. Effects on global 

supply chains and operational efficiency 

continue to persist.

Striving Ahead

Gradual reopening of the global economy differs in different parts of the world 

where we operate. Seizing new opportunities and mitigating foreseeable risks 

remain our core strategy to achieve new revenue streams and maintain existing 

market leadership.

Occupational Health and Safety

In addition to the occupational health and 

safety risks that arise from the nature of the 

Group’s business, the continuous spread of 

COVID-19, in particular the new virus variants, 

poses new health risks for our employees and 

business partners.

Enforce Health and Safety Measures

The Group’s dedicated health taskforces remain in place to supervise, monitor and 

review health and safety measures in accordance with health directives and local 

public health guidelines. We also maintain good relationships with suppliers of 

protective equipment and facemasks so that all personnel can be delivered with 

sufficient protective gear to remain safe within our premises.

Supply Chain Management

Coupled with the constraints due to the 

pandemic lockdowns and business flow 

restrictions, rising steel prices and soft 

market conditions have disrupted our sales 

distribution, particularly in the first half of 

FY2021. These issues may arise again in 

the future and post risks to our supply chain 

management.

Strengthening Local Supply Chains

Yongmao continues to maintain a policy of supporting local procurement and make 

sure of locally-sourced materials in our production sites. This helps us to reduce 

production and sourcing risks as well as to support local suppliers.

In the second half of the year, the Group observes business and industry recovery 

throughout our supply chain where we were able to fill more orders and post 

record high revenue in FY2021.

RISKS

OPPORTUNITIES AND RESPONSE

Environmental Risks

We face physical environmental risks arising 

from climate change. This includes extreme 

and intense weather events such as storm 

surges and flooding. The Group also faces 

transition risks that are resulted from 

changing environmental laws and regulations 

related but not limited to emissions, energy 

efficiency, water use, and waste disposal.

Minimizing Environmental Impact

Yongmao is committed to minimizing environmental impacts and finding new 

and innovative ways to do so. Our Board and management personnel monitor 

the environmental impact of our operations and require product sites to report on 

related environmental data. In FY2021, we further implement smart solutions such 

as Solidworks/Computer-Aided Design (CAD)assist production and integrating 

production materials to ensure a higher operation efficiency while minimizing 

material wastage and faulty parts. We have also made further progress in ensuring 

internal company communications paperless.

Talent Retention

High turnover rates may be caused by 

market conditions and prevailing economic 

circumstances. Talent loss presents a 

constant risk to our operations where in 

particular some specialist roles take a lengthy 

time to fill and employees to properly train up 

to our high standards.

Retaining Talent Through Enriching Corporate Culture

The Group believes that embedding a positive and good corporate culture not only 

helps employees to pursue a meaningful purpose in their work, but also assist us 

in retaining them for the long run. In these difficult times, we pay closer attention 

to the physical and mental wellbeing of our staff, addition to providing relevant 

training to learn new skills and knowledge in enriching their professional careers.

YONGMAO HOLDINGS LIMITED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021

Despite the challenging circumstances that continue to persist from this year’s beginning, the Group has managed to attain the 

first RMB1.0 billion mark in revenue, indicating a 6.8% year-on-year rise. In tandem with this growth in revenue, the Group’s gross 

profit grew 2.5% year-on-year to RMB255.0 million in FY2021. However, our average gross profit margin has reduced slightly down 

to 24.8% due to lower average selling price and higher production overheads compounded by an increase in steel prices in 2H 

FY2021.

The Group is proud to have supplied more of our high-quality cranes to over 80 countries and regions, as well as contributed to a 

slew of remarkable constructions such as the Shanghai North Bund Project, Taiping Mountain Nuclear Power Station Project, and the 

Zvezda Shipyard in Russia.

The table below outline our progress in achieving our previous targets:

TARGET(S) SET IN FY2020

PROGRESS IN FY2021

Achieve positive cash flow generated from operating activities.

In Progress to achieve target. In FY2021, our cash flow used 

in operating activities was RMB31.9million. In FY2022, we will 

conduct measures to increase the collection of receivables in 

order to achieve the goal of positive cash flow from operating 

activities.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OUTLOOK

Looking ahead, we believe that we can remain highly competitive in our key markets, especially in markets where Yongmao is 

already the market leader. With strong government support and easing of pandemic restrictions, we are optimistic that supply 

chains can soon return to normality while our clients and partners can attain speedy business recovery. Reinforced by our 

commercial resilience, we continue to strive forward and accept new challenges.

STRENGTHENING 

RESPONSIBLE OPERATIONS

The Group considers responsible operations to be an integral part of our business practices and corporate social responsibility. As 

always, we keep strengthening responsible operations throughout our value chain so that we stay as a trustworthy business in the 

eyes of our commercial partners and stakeholders.

PROCUREMENT PRACTICES

The Group maintains strict control over our materials and equipment procurement, and tender management procedures. The 

Procurement Management Team is led by a general manager and has various heads of the procurement, production, sales and R&amp;D 

departments as its members. The team is responsible for the following aspects of procurement:

RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT TEAM

•	

The	validation	and	approval	of	procurement	plans	and	tendering	projects

•	

The	examination	and	approval	of	procurement	tendering	methods	and	evaluation	methods

•	

Determining	the	bid	evaluation	team	and	the	participation	of	relevant	staff

•	

Granting	the	final	confirmation	of	successful	bidders

The Group has a Procurement Product Quality Policy, which governs the resources acquired and used in our procurement processes, 

in place to ensure a high standard in relevant procedures. Under our responsible procurement practices, bidders are required to 

submit information on technical standards, specifications, quality requirements, supply methods and delivery times of the materials 

when submitting their bids. The Group also requires its suppliers to have an ISO9001 quality system certification or other equivalent 

qualifications.

reserves the right to report any suspected criminal involvement in bidding-related activities to 

the relevant authorities.

We have placed emphasis on contracting local suppliers whenever possible. Compared to the previous year, we have increased our 

proportion of using local suppliers. The below table demonstrates the Group’s procurement data and suppliers’ breakdown.

The table below shows the breakdown of procurement-related data across Yongmao’s production facilities in Fushun City. 

Procurement-related data from Yongmao’s Singapore operations have not been included as Yongmao Singapore acts as an agent to 

sell products manufactured by the PRC-based production facilities and therefore does not have a significant procurement footprint 

external to the Group.

ANTI-CORRUPTION

Yongmao treasures values such as trustworthiness, integrity and fairness when we conduct our business across geographies. All 

forms of corruption are prohibited and the Group does not tolerate behavior such as extortion, fraud, money laundering and bribery. 

Through clear written documents like the Integrity Declaration by Managerial Personnel and the Agreement on Administrative 

Integrity, we expressly enforce a zero-tolerance policy towards indecent and illegal business practices related to corruption.

By signing the Integrity Declaration by Managerial Personnel, our senior and middle managerial staff pledge to abide by the 

following code of conduct:

responsible business operations, but also integrity and self-discipline should be the norms in all 

daily work and management tasks. A way to establish our good corporate culture of “Heaven 

rewards diligence and humanity”.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (“OH&amp;S”) 

During our business operations and manufacturing processes, occupational health and safety is an important task which must be 

addressed seriously. In this section, we outline our general OH&amp;S measures and specific policies in handling COVID-19.

OH&amp;S TRAINING AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Our Safety Management System outlines safety guidelines that assist our departmental mangers to implement occupational 

health and safety procedures in order to a safe environment for employees to work in. In line with local regulations, the Safety 

Management System is reviewed regularly by management and revised when it is necessary to improve certain safety procedures.

The Group offers a variety of safety training programmes conducted by internal and external experts for our employees, including 

fresh hires, management-level personnel and employees who engage in special lines of work. To ensure everyone understands the 

latest OH&amp;S requirements, we require employees to take an annual examination on health and safety with test results logged in 

their profiles.

The Group’s management also plays a key role in implementing and overseeing the Group’s Safety Management System through a 

clearly defined set of responsibilities.

ENVIRONMENTAL

STEWARDSHIP

The Group recognizes that safeguarding the nature environment is an essential attribute of a socially-responsible company, and an 

important element within ESG. 

MATERIALS

Throughout our routine operations and production process, the Group generates waste materials such as steel material offcuts and 

iron filings. We also collect and recycle waste materials at designated recycling points as part of our recycling measures. In terms 

of recycling manufacturing materials, remaining parts of the steel material offcuts used for manufacturing the counterweight of our 

tower cranes are gathered for recycling. To strengthen our efforts, we are integrating different product materials to ensure better 

overall utilization rates.

The Group is consistently enforcing our policy in dealing with various production wastes. We have dispensed waste materials, 

such as iron filings and carton boxes, sold them to qualified waste treatment vendors contracted by the Group through competitive 

bidding processes. In order to standardize the entire process, our Waste Management Department is responsible to supervise the 

arrangement, monitoring and processing of waste materials. 

The following table shows the amount of steel used as production input materials in both of our factories in Fushun City:
