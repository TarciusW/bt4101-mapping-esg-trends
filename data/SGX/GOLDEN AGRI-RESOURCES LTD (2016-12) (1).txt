ABOUT THIS REPORT (102-1)

Golden Agri-Resources Ltd (GAR or the Company) 

published our first sustainability report in 2011. Since 

then, we have progressively continued to improve how 

we report and engage with our stakeholders in an open 

and transparent manner.

Through our sustainability reporting, we hope to provide 

stakeholders with a better understanding of our approach 

to responsible palm oil and our progress in meeting our 

commitments.

SCOPE OF THIS REPORT (102-46, 102-49, 102-50, 102-50, 102-51)

This report covers our environmental, social and 

economic performance across our plantations, mills and 

some key aspects of palm oil sales operations of GAR in 

Indonesia, which is our main production base and where 

we employ the majority of our work force. 

Unless otherwise stated, the report does not include the 

Company’s other activities outside of Indonesia. 

The content of this report focuses primarily on activities 

carried out within the financial year of January to 

December 2016. 

REPORTING STANDARDS (102-54)

This year we have moved to adopt the Global Reporting 

Initiative (GRI) Standards. These reporting guidelines 

set out a framework for our reporting, which includes 

the principles and standard disclosures that we have to 

report on for our economic, environmental and social 

performance.

This report has been prepared to be in accordance with 

GRI Standards – Core option. This includes adhering to 

the GRI principles for defining report content:

• 

Stakeholder Inclusiveness: responding to stakeholder 

expectations and interests

• 

Sustainability Context: presenting performance in the 

wider sustainability context

• 

Materiality: focusing on issues where we can have the 

greatest impact and that are most important to our 

business and stakeholders

• 

Completeness: including all information that is of 

significant economic, environmental, and social 

impact to enable stakeholders to assess the Company’s 

performance

For a full content index of our GRI Standards indicators 

with relevant references provided, please refer to 

page 66.

ASSURANCE (102-56, 103-3)

We are committed to working towards the full assurance 

of the information presented in our sustainability 

report. In addition to having the calculation of our GHG 

emissions for our subsidiary in Indonesia, PT SMART Tbk, 

independently verified by EY, we have also commissioned 

Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) to carry out a 

survey of workplace practices and environment in some 

of our estates in Indonesia. More information can be

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016


Franky Oesman Widjaja

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT (102-10, 102-14, 102-15)

Despite the challenges caused by the El Niño conditions 

which began in 2015 and severely impacted 2016 

production, we were able to successfully “weather the 

storm” due to the protection provided by our expanded 

and strengthened integrated business model. 

The impact of El Niño started easing in the final quarter 

of 2016 and we saw production starting to recover. 

This was accompanied by a recovery in prices thanks to 

the low stock levels in the large consuming countries, 

while palm oil supply remained muted. The Indonesian 

government’s commitment towards its biodiesel policy 

has increased overall demand for palm oil, and this 

provided further support for crude palm oil (CPO) 

prices. During the year, we recorded 11 percent growth 

in revenue to US$7.21 billion and a six percent increase 

in EBITDA to US$572 million. 

STRATEGIC FOCUS TO ACHIEVE VISION

We focus our business transformation efforts on entering 

a new age of efficiency, sustainability and innovation 

throughout our vertically integrated value chain to grow 

profitability, as the partner of choice to our stakeholders.

GAR is working to maintain its position as a leading 

sustainable palm oil producer by applying best 

agronomic practices. Our precision agriculture includes 

the ability to closely monitor plantation performance 

in detail by breaking down each concession into 30 

hectare block level, which is unparalleled in the sector. 

REALISING SUSTAINABILITY POLICY IN PRACTICE 

2016 was a year of consolidation as we continued to 

carry out initiatives in line with our belief that economic 

growth can go hand-in-hand with environmental 

protection and in the spirit of achieving sustainable 

human progress as envisioned in the UN’s Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs). 

The World Economic Forum has called for new models 

of rural development at the forest frontier be developed 

as global demand for agricultural and forestry products 

continue to rise. Our innovative programmes on forest 

conservation partnerships with the community are 

part of this new model, allowing us to implement our 

commitments under the GAR Social and Environmental 

Policy (GSEP).  

Having identified an area equivalent to the size of 

Singapore for conservation across our concessions, 

we are now working with communities to make forest 

conservation a practical reality, while taking into 

account their needs and aspirations. This involves 

intensive engagement and consultation with them to 

map areas for food security and village boundaries 



“Having identified an

Chairman’s Statement

and lays the foundation for further consultations on 

forest conservation. By the end of 2016 we had rolled 

out participatory mapping in 67 villages across our 

concessions and carried out conservation planning in 

10 villages, securing agreement to protect over 7,000 

hectares of forest.

A core element of this approach involves designing 

Alternative 

Livelihood 

programmes 

that 

allow 

communities to earn an income without disturbing 

forests and sensitive ecosystems. Alternative Livelihood 

programmes currently being piloted by GAR include 

organic vegetable farming using spare communal 

land. These projects bring several benefits including 

improving food self-sufficiency and additional income 

from sustainable farming. With help and guidance 

from GAR, local communities are exposed to new, 

sustainable ways of farming without intensive use of 

chemicals and more importantly, without the use of 

fire to clear land. 

Last year we suffered virtually zero fire incidents in 

our concessions as we continue to be vigilant. Our 

Emergency Response personnel continue to receive 

ongoing training so that they are able to suppress any 

fires that may occur. 

We also continued to tackle the issue of fires in our 

surrounding communities and we are complementing 

our 

community 

conservation 

partnerships 

with 

community-based fire prevention programmes. We 

piloted our fire prevention programme, Desa Siaga Api 

in 2016, in 17 villages in West Kalimantan and Jambi. 

At the end of the first year of the programme, all the 

villages met targets for fire prevention and qualified 

for community infrastructure support. Building on this 

success, the pilot will now evolve into an expanded 

programme called Desa Makmur Peduli Api and 

will focus on three elements: fire prevention, forest 

conservation and food security. 

In addition to working with local communities, we have 

deepened engagement with our suppliers. Bringing 

our supply chain along with us on our sustainability 

journey through dialogue and engagement is essential 

if we are to ensure that the palm oil industry adopts and 

strengthens responsible practices. The launch of our 

Traceability to the Plantation (TTP) exercise in 2016 is 

enabling us to reach a greater number of our suppliers 

including middlemen and smallholders.

Last year, we conducted two inaugural SMART SEED 

workshops for our suppliers offering them an avenue to 

meet government, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) 

and other experts on critical issues such as obtaining 

Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) certification. 

We are also carrying out a programme of supplier mill 

visits which enables us to obtain a complete picture of 

where our suppliers stand with regards to responsible 

practices; build trust to embark on the sustainability 

journey together and help them adopt responsible 

practices. These efforts will ultimately help build a 

more resilient supply chain and industry. 

In the spirit of continuous improvement we have 

commissioned 

several 

independent 

surveys 

and 

verifications by external parties to check on our progress 

in implementing the GSEP. The results of these studies 

will help us close any gaps between policy and practice 

as we strive towards responsible palm oil production. 

OUTLOOK CONTINUES TO BE ROBUST

We are excited about the future of palm oil as our 

core business. Although prices will remain subject to 

volatility as a commodity, the long-term fundamentals 

are robust. As the most economical vegetable oil with 

the highest yield and widest range of uses, palm oil will 

remain customers’ number one choice to fulfil both 

food and non-food needs. GAR will continue to invest 

for the long-term development of this industry in the 

areas of R&amp;D, technology and sustainability.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016




As the largest palm oil grower in Indonesia, GAR believes 

that socio-economic growth can go hand-in-hand with 

environmental protection and sustainable practices.

Our sustainability strategy uses a scientific approach 

to understanding our most material issues across all 

areas of our business – this includes our impacts on the 

environment, the communities around us, our workers, our 

supply chain and the consumers who use our products. In 

2015, we updated our policy governing sustainability and 

launched the GAR Social and Environmental Policy (GSEP). 

It covers the key economic, social and environmental issues 

facing the palm oil industry, and serves as the company’s 

main roadmap towards responsible palm oil production. 

Based on this policy, we have set performance improvement 

targets for our material sustainability issues. The monitoring, 

evaluation and reporting of our performance through 

our Annual and Sustainability Reports helps us track our 

progress and identify areas for improvement. 

We work on achieving our goals through engagement, 

partnership and collaboration with key stakeholders 

including the government, communities, Civil Society 

Organisations (CSOs) and our industry peers. Furthermore, 

we benchmark our performance against international and 

industry standards such as the Roundtable on Sustainable 

Palm Oil (RSPO) principles and criteria, the High Carbon 

Stock Approach (HCS) and the United Nations Global 

Compact (UNGC). 

To ensure the appropriate level of oversight, we have 

established a Sustainability Committee comprising the 

senior leadership team across the upstream, downstream 

and corporate centre which meets regularly to oversee the 

development and implementation of GAR’s sustainability 

strategy. It reports to the Chairman and CEO and the Board, 

and is a key part of GAR’s efforts to embed sustainability in 

its everyday operations. 

Ultimately, we believe that our investment in responsible 

palm oil production is essential in helping our business 

thrive and create value for shareholders, our employees 

and the community.

THE SCALE OF OUR OPERATION (102-4, 102-7)

GAR maintains its position as the leading oil palm plantation 

group in Indonesia with estates spanning the archipelago. 

The Company manages 169 oil palm estates with a total 

area of 488,252 hectares. As at end 2016, the planted area 

consists of estates owned by GAR (called ‘nucleus’) totaling 

385,997 hectares and estates owned by smallholders 

(called ‘plasma’) amounting to 102,255 hectares. 

The harvested FFB are processed in GAR-owned 

milling facilities, which are strategically located near the 

plantations, to produce CPO and PK. GAR has 45 mills 

with a combined installed annual capacity of 12.81 million 

tonnes. During the year, our mills produced 2.02 million 

tonnes of CPO and 494 thousand tonnes of PK.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016


PALM OIL – AN SDG COMMODITY

Palm oil is produced from the fruit of oil palms, which 

grow in fertile regions close to the equator. Oil is 

extracted from both the fruit and its kernel (the nut 

at its centre), producing crude palm oil, crude palm 

kernel oil and palm kernel expeller, which can be 

further refined and used in different products. 

Palm oil has the highest yield of any oil crop and 

makes more efficient use of land in its production 

than any other vegetable oil. In 2016, mature oil palms 

occupied only 6.6 percent of the total harvested area 

for vegetable oils. However, in the form of palm oil 

and palm kernel oil, they formed 37 percent of global 

vegetable oil production in 2016.

It is also extremely versatile, used as a cooking oil, in 

foods such as margarine and ice cream, and in thousands 

of non-food products from soaps to cosmetics, candles 

and pharmaceuticals. Palm oil is also a valuable biofuel, 

which can contribute to reducing carbon emissions. 

Palm oil’s low cost and versatility have resulted in rapidly 

growing worldwide demand. 

In Indonesia, palm oil production has helped to lift 

millions of rural farmers out of absolute poverty. It is 

estimated that a palm oil farmer can earn up to seven 

times more than a subsistence farmer. It provides 

direct and indirect employment for an estimated 16 

million people and generated US$17.8 billion worth of 

palm oil exports in 2016 for Indonesia. Palm oil estates 

also provide critical infrastructure and facilities for rural 

populations and gives them access to healthcare and 

education. Through this, palm oil is helping to deliver 

several UN SDGs including ending poverty, decent work 

and economic growth, providing quality education and 

health and well-being and reducing inequalities. 

The chart below shows that palm oil not only 

produces the best yield of all commercial oil crops 

but also creates less impact in terms of fertiliser and 

pesticide usage.

About GAR

THE VALUE CHAIN OF OUR PALM OIL BUSINESS (102-2)

Our palm oil business, which is mostly in Indonesia, is 

fully vertically integrated, involved in every aspect of palm 

oil production. We develop and produce oil palm seeds, 

plant and manage oil palm plantations, harvest and mill 

the fruit of the palms to create our palm products (CPO 

and PK). We then refine CPO and crush PK to produce 

higher value products such as cooking oil, margarine, 

shortening, biodiesel and other palm oil derivative 

goods. We sell our products both in bulk to wholesalers 

and direct to consumers through some of Asia’s most 

popular food and cookery brands. In Indonesia, our 

products are marketed under our prominent brands, 

Filma and Kunci Mas.

We aim to offer an extensive range of products, and focus 

our research and development on evolving our portfolio to 

meet customer demand. This includes consumer demand 

for higher quality and more sustainable palm oil goods. We 

are working to develop a higher-value product mix, with 

a greater emphasis on developing PK into oleochemicals, 

which are used to make soaps and personal care products.

We also operate a processing business in India through 

our subsidiary Gemini Edibles &amp; Fats India Private Limited, 

with refining capability and an established brand and 

distribution network in the Eastern part of the country. 

Through this subsidiary, we are able to participate in 

India’s fast growing branded cooking oil and specialty

fat sectors, and also to bring our products closer to the 

greater European and Middle East markets.

Our palm oil business contributes to the performance of 

Plantation and Palm Oil Mills as well as Palm and Laurics 

segments (see page 130 of GAR Annual Report 2016 Note 

40 “Operating Segment Information” for further details).

THE VALUE CHAIN OF OUR OILSEEDS AND OTHERS 

BUSINESS

In China, GAR owns integrated vegetable oil facilities 

comprising one of country’s largest deep-sea ports, 

oilseed storage, crushing and refining facilities. We operate 

a deep-sea port in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province where we 

import and store oils and grains, including refined palm oil 

from our own operation in Indonesia and soybean. Our 

oilseed crushing and refining facilities in Ningbo and Tianjin 

produce soybean meal to be sold within China, refined 

soybean and palm oil, and higher value products such as 

margarine, shortening and butter oil substitutes. These are 

sold both to wholesalers and direct to consumers. 

GAR also operates a food business in China through 

Florentina 

International 

Holdings 

Limited, 

which 

manufactures and distributes a variety of economy and 

premium grade snack noodle and instant noodle products, 

and other snack products in the country.

This business contributes to the performance of Oilseeds and 

Other segments (see page 130 of GAR Annual Report 2016 

Note 40 “Operating Segment Information” for further details).

BALANCING SUSTAINABILITY WITH STRATEGIC 

GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES

To sustain our long-term growth, we continue to study the 

potential for oil palm plantations in other countries. We are 

investing in Africa through The Verdant Fund LP, a private 

equity fund that owns Golden Veroleum (Liberia) Inc (GVL). 

The Liberian government has granted GVL a concession to 

develop land for oil palm plantations. The GSEP applies to 

all GAR investments and as such GVL follows sustainable 

development practices as laid out in the policy. GVL is also 

a member of the RSPO and adheres to its Principles and 

Criteria. As at end of 2016, GVL cultivated approximately 

15,000 hectares of oil palm plantations, with GAR providing 

technical expertise to ensure quality and sustainability.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN 2016 (102-48, 201-1)

During 2016, GAR posted a revenue of over US$7.2 billion, 

11 percent higher than the previous year. EBITDA and 

underlying profit also registered higher at US$572 million 

and US$186 million, respectively. These stronger results 

were bolstered by our integrated business model and the 

increase of CPO market price, more than offsetting weaker 

palm product output. The Company’s financial position 

strengthened with prudent gearing (adjusted net debt to 

equity ratio) at 0.43 times.

Looking ahead, we are confident that the prospects for the 

palm oil industry remain promising in the long term. Although 

prices will remain volatile as a commodity, fundamentals 

continue to be robust. As the most economical vegetable oil 

with the highest yield and widest range of uses, palm oil will 

remain customers’ number one choice to fulfil both food and 

non-food needs. Food demand will maintain its growth in line 

with the growing populations and rising per capita income in 

developing countries, while non-food demand will largely be 

driven by the biodiesel mandates. GAR will continue to invest 

for the long-term development of this industry in the areas 

of research and development, technology and sustainability.

objectives with integrity and in compliance with the law, 

no matter where we operate. We comply with applicable 

laws in all the countries in which we do business, including 

all anti-bribery and corruption regulations. No incidents of 

bribery or corruption were identified in 2016. 

We expect all our employees, contractors and business 

partners to adhere to GAR Code of Conduct. Our Code is 

purposefully designed to be practically applicable to our 

day-to-day business, with definite guidelines on acceptable 

and unacceptable behaviour. The Code emphasises the 

Company’s commitment to fair employment practices; 

diversity; and its stand against discrimination and zero 

tolerance for harassment or abuse. No cases of harassment 

and abuse were identified in 2016.

The Code also details avenues for raising concerns and 

whistleblowing 

procedures, 

encouraging 

employees 

to report any possible improprieties in confidence and 

without fear of retaliation. Since the launch of the updated

Our Approach to Responsible Palm Oil Production

OUR APPROACH TO RESPONSIBLE PALM OIL 

PRODUCTION (102-11, 102-12, 103-2)

As one of the largest integrated palm oil companies, we 

believe in leading by example. Since we adopted the 

first Forest Conservation Policy in the palm oil industry 

in 2011, we have continued to make strides in moving 

towards responsible palm oil production and we seek to 

encourage the rest of the industry to adopt responsible 

practices through engagement and dialogue. 

Our roadmap for achieving this is the GAR Social and 

Environmental Policy or the GSEP. Launched in 2015, the 

policy consolidates all our sustainability, human rights 

and labour policies in one document. It contains our 

commitments for our most material sustainability issues 

and our overall approach to ensuring their responsible 

management. The GSEP embodies our belief that 

economic growth, social progress and environmental 

protection 

can 

go 

hand-in-hand. 

In 

envisioning 

sustainable progress for people and the planet it is 

aligned with the UN SDGs. As a signatory to the UN Global 

Compact through our subsidiary, SMART, we are also 

committed to working on and delivering the UN SDGs. 

Based on our identified material issues, we have begun 

to explore how we as a company can play our part in 

the achievement of the SDGs. Our first step has been 

to identify the Goals that are most aligned with our 

commitments towards achieving responsible palm oil 

production. This is illustrated at the beginning of each 

chapter within this report. 

We have focused much attention and resources on 

resolving environmental issues. In addition, we keep 

abreast of other concerns such as labour practices and 

human rights and we are focusing our attention on 

ensuring proper implementation of our commitments in 

these areas.  

Through our deepening engagement with our supply 

chain initiated by our traceability exercises, we are actively 

trying to influence and encourage our suppliers, and by 

extension the rest of the industry, to adopt responsible 

practices. 

All these endeavours require us to work closely and 

engage with multiple stakeholders. Partnership is the 

cornerstone of our approach to achieving our goals. We 

do this in recognition of our limits as a private company 

and we seek to learn and gain valuable feedback from 

our stakeholders such as local communities, smallholder 

farmers, government, CSOs, suppliers, the RSPO, 

our industry peers and implementation partners. Our 

sustainability journey would not be possible without 

constant engagement, dialogue and consultation with 

our key stakeholders. 

In several instances, we have worked with CSO 

stakeholders like Greenpeace to develop new guidelines 

and standards such as the High Carbon Stock Approach 

(HCSA) to address deforestation concerns. This approach 

is increasingly being adopted not only in our industry but 

also in other sectors such as forestry.

The GSEP was developed with feedback and input from 

key stakeholders including CSOs such as Greenpeace, 

Rainforest Action Network (RAN), Forest Peoples 

Programme (FPP) and our implementation partner, TFT. 

We also continue to improve our Standard Operational 

Procedures for carrying out FPIC, handling grievances, 

conflict resolution and participatory mapping, often with 

input from external stakeholders such as CSOs. 

Our approach to responsible palm oil production is 

underpinned by scientific research and development and 

the use of technological advances. Our flagship research 

facility SMARTRI conducts research to improve yields 

and productivity sustainably – minimising impacts on the 

environment and the people who work and live on our 

plantations. With extreme weather phenomena such as 

El Niño becoming more severe, SMARTRI also conducts 

research into developing more resilient non-GMO seed 

stock and improving agronomic practices to cope with 

the impact of climate change.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH (102-15, 102-17, 102-18, 102-19, 

102-20, 102-21, 103-2)

The board and senior management fully supports GAR’s 

sustainability commitments under the GSEP. Responsible 

palm oil matters come under the purview of the Sustainability 

Committee (SC) which is chaired by the Corporate Strategy 

and Business Development Director. The SC comprises the 

senior leadership team from the upstream, downstream and 

corporate business units as well as the head of the Sustainability 

Department and other staff members from the Department. 

The SC reports directly to the Chairman and CEO of GAR and 

the Board and meets regularly to oversee the development 

and implementation of the GSEP and the monitoring of 

performance across all our business operations. Aside from 

these meetings, urgent and developing issues are escalated 

to relevant SC members for their input and decisions. 

We have invested additional resources with the aim of 

embedding responsible palm practices in our day-to-day 

operations. A large Sustainability and Strategic Stakeholder 

Engagement Department has been established with 129 

staff in Jakarta and another 176 in the field. Ongoing 

training in the implementation of the GSEP is being 

carried out for all relevant staff – to date, over 8,500 

staff have been trained. 

 

As detailed in the Organisation Charts, we employ specialists 

to oversee and handle key areas such as conflict resolution, 

HCS/HCV management, fire prevention, community 

consent (FPIC), grievance management and health and 

safety. The department also works with colleagues in 

Human Resources on labour issues to ensure free and 

fair labour practices in line with the GSEP.

RESPONSIBLE HANDLING OF COMPLAINTS AND 

GRIEVANCES (103-2, 103-3, 102-17)

In 2015, GAR established a formal Grievance Procedure 

to ensure that as a company, we are responsive to any 

grievances from external parties. It helps us to address 

a wide range of concerns, including those related to 

our most material issues, and covers our worldwide 

operations and our third-party suppliers.

During 2016, eight grievances were raised with GAR. 

Of these, one has been closed, with GAR continuing to 

monitor. In 2016, we also resolved and closed three other 

outstanding grievances. GAR continues to actively review 

and work towards a resolution with stakeholders on all 

other grievances. The Grievance List can be viewed on 

the GAR Sustainability Dashboard.

MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REPORTING (102-12, 

103-3)

Under the GSEP, we are committed to monitoring, 

evaluating and reporting our performance. To help us 

continuously improve we have engaged independent 

external parties to carry out verification studies and 

surveys. These include a study by Business for Social 

Responsibility (BSR) on our work environment practices. 

BSR will deliver its final results and conclusions in 2017. 

The Rainforest Alliance has also been asked to carry out 

a verification study on the implementation of the GSEP in 

the first quarter of 2017 and the results will be reported on 

our website and in future reports. We have also engaged 

EY to work with us on our Carbon Footprint Assessment 

GAR GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE

1 The Grievance Raiser may nominate a third party to act on their behalf.

2 Action plans will work to agreed timelines of no more than three months to reach resolution. However, where circumstances 

prevent resolution within that time – for example, where legal proceedings are involved – progress at three months will be 

reviewed to assess whether there is clear evidence of a resolution process being actively implemented.

Our Materiality Matrix

Our Approach to Responsible Palm Oil Production

Project which will help us establish baseline measurements 

of GHG emissions and formulate strategies for reduction. 

These are just some of the external assessments that are 

helping us monitor our progress and take the right steps to 

close gaps and improve our responsible practices whether 

it be in conservation, climate change, human rights, labour 

practices or social and community engagement. 

We regularly report our progress on several key 

initiatives such as our Traceability to Plantation (TTP) 

exercise, our progress in resolving social conflicts and 

handling grievances and monthly fire incident reports 

on the GAR website and Sustainability Dashboard as 

well as reports such as the GAR Annual Report and the 

GAR Sustainability Report. 

DEFINING OUR MATERIAL SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS 

(102-15, 102-46, 102-47, 102-49, 103-1)

In 2015, we conducted a materiality assessment based 

on the GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines 

to determine the relative importance of different 

sustainability topics to both our stakeholders and our 

long-term business success. We identified 15 broad 

sustainability topics which have been used to inform the 

on-going development of our sustainability efforts and 

our approach to reporting on sustainability. A description 

of the process we undertook can be found in our 2015 

Sustainability Report. 

This year, we have taken the further step to refine 

and focus our reporting on our most material issues. 

Seven topics, positioned in the top right-hand corner 

of our materiality matrix, are the key priorities for the 

sustainability of our operations and are of high concern to 

stakeholders. Therefore, our report focuses on reporting 

most comprehensively on these issues. We report key 

information on the other relevant topics as appropriate 

based on their sustainability context and importance to 

our stakeholders.

PRIORITY

Key:

Our priority issues are the most material sustainability issues with high impact on society and the environment, and of high concern to 

stakeholders. These form the focus of our sustainability policy, strategic approach to responsible palm oil, and our sustainability report. Our 

reporting on priority issues aims to fully meet the requirements of GRI Standards Core Option.

Our significant issues are of ongoing importance to GAR and of medium concern to stakeholders. They are actively managed by the business. 

Updates on our management and performance in relation to these issues is included in our report as relevant based on sustainability context 

and stakeholder interest. 

Our moderate issues are relevant, but of lower importance to both GAR and stakeholders. These issues are still part of GAR’s responsible 

business practices and are reported as relevant based on sustainability context and stakeholder interest.

MATERIAL TOPICS

VALUE CHAIN

Value Chain

Plantation

Production, 

Processing 

and Refineries

Distribution  

and 

Consumption

Deforestation of High Carbon Stock (HCS) forests and peat land

• 

Removal of HCS forests – distinguished forests that hold a 

higher amount of carbon – and peat land are major sources 

of GHG emissions contributing significantly to climate change. 

This issue could affect GAR plantations or the plantations of  

our smallholders.

Degradation of High Conservation Value (HCV) areas and biodiversity

• 

Deforestation or development of HCV areas of high biological, 

ecological, social or cultural values can lead to habitat loss  

and affect plant and animal regional species diversity.  

This issue could affect GAR plantations or the plantations  

of our smallholders.

Community relations and resolution of community conflicts

• 

Maintaining community dialogue and engagement, and 

promoting peaceful resolution of any conflicts and disputes 

that arise is integral to the sustainability and success of our 

operations. 

Free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) for indigenous and local communities

• 

To ensure land development and use is responsible and human 

rights are respected it is important to:

– Freely inform communities of licenses, government 

and company policies regarding land compensation, 

development plans, land valuation approach, process 

of verifying land ownership, proof of ownership and 

procedures for land measurements and compensation  

in cases of location permits.

– Ensure FPIC and comply with local and national law  

in land offers.

Supply chain sustainability (including smallholders)

• 

We are committed to spreading responsible palm practices 

throughout our value chain. Ensuring the sustainability of our 

suppliers including smallholders is critical to our operations. 

Furthermore, palm oil production is the source of livelihood for 

millions of farmers and their communities in Indonesia.

Labour relations and human rights

• 

In line with our commitment to the ten principles of the UNGC, 

we believe in a responsible approach to ensuring a productive 

and engaged workforce. This requires fair, ethical, and positive 

relations with our workers (including employees, suppliers and 

smallholder farmers), and prohibiting child labour, respecting 

human rights and labour standards.

Employee health, safety and wellbeing

• 

The health, safety and wellbeing of our workers are key to our 

operations. Therefore we are committed to the prevention 

of work-related illness, injury and accidents by continually 

improving OHS performance, in accordance with government 

regulations and implementing best practices standards.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT (102-13, 102-40, 102-42, 

102-43, 102-44, 103-2)

We believe that a pro-active approach to stakeholder 

engagement is essential. Through a stakeholder mapping 

exercise, we have identified the stakeholder groups, listed 

below, that are fundamental to the sustainability of our 

operations, and which have a significant interest in the impact 

of our material sustainability topics. We adopt a tailored 

approach to ensure regular engagement with these groups.

We operate in a dynamic industry and our understanding 

of our most important stakeholders continuously evolve 

to reflect this. We review and update the way that we 

communicate with our stakeholders on a regular basis.

REALISING SUSTAINABILITY POLICY IN PRACTICE 

In 2016, we continued to implement initiatives to turn 

our sustainability commitments into practical reality. New 

partnerships with communities, customers, suppliers and 

government play a key part in this endeavour. Our efforts 

are also aligned with several of the UN SDGs. 

PROGRESS ON PRACTICAL CONSERVATION (304-1, 103-2)

Since we adopted the first Forest Conservation Policy 

in the industry in 2011, we have made decoupling 

palm oil production from deforestation a top priority. 

We carry out High Conservation Value (HCV) and High 

Carbon Stock (HCS) assessments as part of our standard 

procedures before embarking on new development.

We have currently identified around 72,000 hectares – an 

area roughly the size of Singapore – of HCV forests (53,248 

hectares) and HCS areas (18,846 hectares) for conservation 

across and adjacent to our concessions.1

Defining these areas on paper is only the first step towards 

conservation; ensuring they are properly protected on 

the ground requires a workable model of collaboration 

and partnership with local communities and other 

key stakeholders such as local government. Without 

this, areas set aside for conservation remain prone to 

encroachment by external parties who frequently regard 

the area as unoccupied land. 

The World Economic Forum has called for new models 

of sustainable rural development at the forest frontier 

and in particular, place-based “protection-production 

partnerships”. At GAR, we have been working on these 

partnerships since 2015, when we began collaborating with 

local communities to formally map their villages through 

Participatory Mapping. We help the villages map critical areas 

such as customary boundaries and land necessary for food 

security. This map is lodged with and formally recognised 

by the authorities, serving amongst other things to clarify 

land tenure rights and enabling villages to gain access to 

government development funds for the first time. 

The mapping lays the foundation for further dialogue 

on conservation through our Participatory Conservation 

Planning process. Our intensive consultative approach 

takes into account local community concerns, needs 

and aspirations including food security requirements and 

continued ability to earn a decent and stable livelihood.

1 The HCS/HCV areas were adjusted slightly lower in 2016 following 

FPIC consultations with local community and on-the-ground 

verification by our consultants which revealed that community 

mixed gardens had previously been erroneously included as 

conservation areas. 

MEET THE MAPMAKER: PAK DIDIK

I’ve worked across both Riau and Kalimantan, and 

covered at least a thousand kilometres as a mapper for 

GAR. Mapping is not an easy process. The view of the 

community can be, “well we’ve managed so far without 

a map, so we’ll carry on”, but my job is to convince 

them of the benefits in mapping, defining, agreeing 

and protecting land claims. Some in the community 

see the benefits a map brings in terms of helping the 

community obtain sustainability certification. For others, 

it’s about recognising that this can help avoid problems 

in the future as the community grows and changes. 

Read about Pak Didik’s work on the GAR website.



We have rolled out mapping in 67 villages across our 

concessions to date and carried out conservation planning 

in 10 villages in West Kalimantan, securing agreement with 

local communities to set aside over 7,000 hectares of HCS 

forests for conservation. 

31

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016


A core element of this approach involves designing 

Alternative Livelihood programmes that allow communities 

to earn an income without disturbing forests and sensitive 

ecosystems. Alternative Livelihood programmes currently 

being piloted by GAR include organic vegetable farming 

using spare communal land. These projects bring benefits 

that include improved food self-sufficiency and additional 

income. With help and guidance from GAR, local 

communities are exposed to new, sustainable ways of 

farming without use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides 

and more importantly, without the use of fire to clear land.

 

We are using this model of community partnership to 

ensure the successful rehabilitation of 2,600 hectares of 

peat land in the PT Agro Lestari Mandiri (AMNL) concession 

in West Kalimantan. While physical rehabilitation is 

continuing apace, a more critical challenge is halting 

future encroachment into the peat areas. Through our 

community conservation partnership and the Alternative 

Livelihoods programme, we have launched an organic 

farming pilot project in the Lembah Hijau 2 village and 

are helping the community with materials and training 

to set up the farm. We are also starting Alternative 

Livelihood programmes in three other concessions in 

West Kalimantan. 

Scaled up, this protection-production model could 

help ensure economic growth in tandem with forest 

conservation and we will be launching similar partnerships 

across our concessions. 

FIRE PREVENTION COMPLEMENTS CONSERVATION (304-4)

We are complementing our community conservation 

partnerships with community-based fire prevention 

programmes in areas that have been identified as fire-

prone. Our fire prevention programme, Desa Siaga Api 

was piloted in 2016 in 17 villages in West Kalimantan and 

Jambi. At the end of the first year of the programme, all 

the villages met targets for fire prevention and qualified 

for community infrastructure support. Three villages 

were also designated by the government as national pilot 

villages to showcase a successful fire prevention initiative. 

Environmental Management

HOW TO RESTORE A FOREST

When restoring burnt peatland forest, the first course 

of action is keep the soil wet.

When consultancy MEC started its land restoration 

project for GAR, it first surveyed the area using drone 

cameras to identify the areas where water was flowing 

out of the peatland through canals, then blocked these 

outlets.

Preventing the peat from degrading by managing the 

water table is the critical factor at this stage, and the 

consultancy says this has been done successfully so far 

in the 2,000 hectares of forest that GAR needs to restore.

Planting takes place around three years on from the 

fires, once the ecosystem has stabilised and some 

ground vegetation has recovered. This is done during 

the dry season, so the seedlings can establish a 

foothold when the ground isn’t too soggy.

Kishokumar Jeyaraj, a director at MEC, says that while 

observers may wish to see instant revegetation this is 

unrealistic. “The last thing you want is high plant mortality. 

It depresses people to see dying plants,” he explains.

The species that have emerged naturally are trialed in 

a test area with new native species to see what thrives, 

then a mosaic of plant species gradually scaled across 

a wider area.

In one hectare, around 10,000 seedlings are planted, 

which costs around US$6,000 for the seedlings alone. 

Including labour and transportation, to restore a 

single hectare “properly” may cost around US$10,000, 

explains Jeyaraj.

It is a diversity of plants that invites animals back to a 

forest, typically birds first, the fish in riparian areas, and 

then small and later larger mammals. While patches of 

forest may support smaller animals, a mosaic landscape 

of connected forests is needed to support larger fauna, 

such as endangered orangutans, rhinos and elephants.

GAR claims it will not cultivate any conservation land 

that burned in the 2015 fires, but not all of it will be 

returned to nature.

“It’s not a strict conservation effort. The needs of the 

community need to be taken into account. You can’t 

exclude them,” says Jeyaraj. “Some marginal areas of 

land, bordering the villages, will be made available for 

crop planting without disturbing the core peat area.

Aside from training and equipping local community 

members to suppress fires rapidly, we also focused on 

education. We worked with schools to spread knowledge 

and awareness to school children about the dangers of 

forest fires and the importance of forest conservation. In 

2016, we worked with 22 schools involving 1,500 students 

in PT AMNL, West Kalimantan. Through this we hope to 

trigger a change in the mindsets of the communities and 

a move towards more sustainable agriculture.

The pilot will now evolve into an expanded programme 

called Desa Makmur Peduli Api and will focus on three 

elements: fire prevention, forest conservation and food 

security. Alternative Livelihood programmes modelled 

on the same lines as the pilot at Lembah Hijau 2 Village 

will be rolled out to the other villages in West Kalimantan. 

While the weather conditions in 2016 were a welcome 

reprieve from the extreme drought and El Niño effects of 

2015, we continue to be vigilant and prepared to tackle 

fires. There has been no let up in training staff in fire 

preparedness and around 10,000 personnel throughout 

our concessions remain on standby to rapidly suppress 

fires. Due to strict adherence to our Zero Burning Policy, 

we had no significant fires on our plantations last year: 

around 0.01 percent of our concession areas were 

affected by fires, all of which were quickly suppressed 

with the majority caused by external parties carrying out 

land preparation activities. These details are reported in 

our monthly fire incident reports on the Sustainability 

Dashboard.

We 

continuously 

educate 

our 

employees, 

local 

communities and related stakeholders on the importance 

of protecting rare and endangered species.

Protection of orangutans remains a special focus for 

GAR. Since 2011, we have partnered with Orangutan 

Foundation International (OFI) to rehabilitate and release 

wild-born, formerly captive primates. As of May 2017, 

we have supported the release of 87 orangutans into 

their natural habitat in Seruyan Forest in Kalimantan, 

Indonesia, with 12 released in 2016 and 24 in 2017. We 

continue to work towards our target of releasing 100 

orangutans by end-2017, although challenges in finding 

safe and suitable habitats for the orangutans may result 

in some delays. We remain committed to the programme 

and are discussing how to overcome these challenges 

and complete the programme with OFI. 

We have also trained over 1,000 staff in orangutan 

conservation. They are mainly involved in field operations 

in Kalimantan with some overseeing our biodiversity and 

conservation efforts. GAR also maintains 1,400 hectares 

of HCV area in Sungai Rungau, Central Kalimantan as an 

orangutan sanctuary.

Through our HCV assessment, we have identified the 

rare and endangered species within our concessions 

and the surrounding landscape. Their habitats are 

classified as HCV areas to be conserved. For our full list 

of threatened species under Indonesia’s National Law of 

Protected Species (Indonesian Government Regulation 

No. 7 of 1999) or on the IUCN Red List, please see the 

Sustainability Dashboard.

MEET THE HOUSEWIFE WHO WANTS TO 

PREVENT FIRE AND HAZE: IBU SOHRIAH

Since the fires and haze, I’m getting more concerned 

about what we can do to prevent the fires and how 

we can deal with them. I took part in training on 

tackling forest fires. Amongst the things we learnt: 

do not to open land by burning; take care when 

disposing cigarette butts and to put out fires after 

cooking fish by the river. 

See Ibu Sohriah’s story on the GAR website.



PROTECTING RARE AND ENDANGERED SPECIES (304-

2, 304-4) 

Operating in Indonesia places us in or near areas of rich 

and varied biodiversity and we want to preserve and 

protect this biodiversity. This is achieved through our 

identification and protection of HCV areas backed up 

by our Zero Tolerance Policy towards hunting, injuring, 

possessing and killing of rare and endangered wildlife. 



As of May 2017, 87 orangutans have been released back into the wild

IMPLEMENTING RIPARIAN BUFFER ZONES (304-4)

Our management of HCV areas also involves the 

rehabilitation of riparian zones that have previously been 

cleared or planted. These riparian buffer zones have 

particular ecological importance, providing specific 

wildlife habitats and playing a key role in water systems. 

 

GAR is implementing a riparian rehabilitation programme 

in 12 concessions located in Central and West Kalimantan. 

In 2016, we began rehabilitating about 1200 hectares. We 

will continue to rehabilitate another 630 hectares in 2017.

REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS (103-1, 305-5)

In 2016, we continued with the process of calculating 

our GHG emissions in selected mills and plantations in 

Kalimantan which was completed in the first quarter of 

2017. Together with the data from mills and plantations 

in the Sumatra region assessed in 2015, this will help us 

complete our baseline studies, which will then be used to 

design overall GHG reduction targets and strategies in 2018.

We have commissioned accounting firm EY to review 

and verify how we calculate our carbon footprint, identify 

viable opportunities to reduce emissions and set short, 

medium and long-term reduction targets for the business.

While we continue to complete and design our overall 

GHG emission reduction stratetgy, we have already 

instituted several emission reduction measures. In 2016, 

we added bio-digester facilities to capture waste methane 

gas in Central Kalimantan at our Hanau, Sungai Rungau, 

Perdana and Semilar mills. In addition to the bio-digester 

facility at Sei Pelakar mill in Jambi and the tank digesters 

in Libo and Rama-Rama mills in Riau, we now have a 

total of seven methane capture facilities. Amongst other 

Environmental Management

34

GOLDEN AGRI-RESOURCES LTD


things, the methane gas is used as an alternative energy 

source, generating electricity for our factory operations.

We estimate that through methane capture and 

avoidance of fossil fuels, the methane capture facilities 

reduce between 40 to 55 percent of operational GHG 

emissions where they are sited. 

MANAGING OUR WATER FOOTPRINT (303-1, 103-1)

Water is a vital resource for our operations and the 

communities in our supply chain. 

We strive to meet all of our water needs through surface 

water that is processed to meet the quality standards 

required for the production process and use ground 

water only in very limited quantities in locations where 

no surface water is available. We continue to improve 

our water efficiency by recycling and reusing where 

appropriate in the palm oil production process.

We note that our water usage is on a rising trend and 

we are implementing efforts to improve our water 

footprint. In 2016, we started an assessment project 

to help further minimise our water footprint. 

We also take steps to minimise any risk of pollution 

of surface and ground water. We follow strict land 

management practices that are designed to reduce 

these risks – for more details see the section on “Soil 

Fertility and Pest Management”.

WASTE RECYCLING AND REUSE (303-1, 306-2)

Under our Zero Waste Policy we aim to reuse, recover and 

recycle. For the last couple of years, we have achieved 100 

percent recycling of waste from the CPO production process. 

The waste includes solid and liquid waste. Solid waste 

consists of empty fruit bunches (EFB) of oil palm, fibre 

and shells. Liquid waste or POME is generated from the 

processing of FFB to CPO. We use both types of waste as 

organic fertiliser and fuel.

POME

100 percent is applied in the field after traditional 

anaerobic and aerobic treatment to render the chemical 

and physical characteristics compliant with national 

regulations. A specific application permit has been 

obtained for each location, with close monitoring of 

environmental impact as requested by the authorities.

In addition, our Downstream R&amp;D has also made a 

considerable impact on reducing packaging and making 

the transport of our products more environmentally 

friendly. We have done this by reducing the material 

thickness or weight of the packaging material to maximise 

space when loading containers. This has led to lower 

costs, lower energy consumption and reduction of carbon 

emissions.

Doing this has helped reduce almost 300 tonnes of plastic 

packaging waste in 2016. We are now exploring further 

packaging design improvements to increase container 

loading capacity by up to 20 percent.

SOIL FERTILITY AND PEST MANAGEMENT 

GAR 

implements 

best 

agricultural 

management 

practices to maintain and enhance soil fertility through 

a comprehensive mineral nutrition management plan. 

We aim to minimise the quantity of fertiliser applied 

whilst maximising yields. This reduces the pressure to 

open more land and reduces the risk of soil degradation 

through oil palm cultivation.

We have Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) which 

specify that the use of fertilisers should be tailored to the 

texture of the soil and its capacity for retaining nutrients; 

that fertilisers should not be applied during periods of 

heavy rain; and that there should always be an appropriate 

interval between applications. We also recycle palm 

fronds and other organic products to increase the fixing 

capacity of soils. 

We follow an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach 

which combines cultural, mechanical, biological and 

chemical means to control pests while minimising 

economic, public health and environmental risks.

Natural solutions and biological controls are our 

preferred method for controlling pests across all our 

plantations, including beneficial plants that attract 

parasitoids to control pests, pathogens or bacteria, and 

natural predators. We supplement this approach using 

handpicking and mechanical traps. 

35

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016


Environmental Management

Examples of this include barn owls which are bred on 

our estates to control the rat population; leaf-eating 

caterpillars are controlled through diversity of flora and 

encouraging beneficial plants and pheromones are used 

to control rhinoceros beetles. 

MONITORING AND MINIMISING THE USE OF 

PESTICIDES (103-2)

We aim to minimise pesticide use throughout all 

growth phases of the palms. We only use chemical 

fungicides in our nurseries, and only deploy chemical 

insecticides and rodenticides to control outbreaks of 

infestation when biological controls have failed. In 

such cases, these products are used carefully and in 

compliance with national laws. Most of the pesticides 

that we use are chemical herbicides for weed control 

and management. 

We apply these according to the following strict SOPs:

• 

Temporal selectivity: applying at specific times and 

reducing the number of applications to between 

one and three per year, depending on the type of 

herbicide 

• 

Spatial selectivity: spraying only the circle of the 

palms and harvesting path, or about 20 percent of 

the soil surface

• 

Product selectivity: choosing only herbicides that 

are compatible with conserving an understory of 

plants to cover the soil

In 2016, GAR stopped using paraquat. In addition, 

pesticides that are categorised as World Health 

Organization Class 1A or 1B, or that are listed by the 

Stockholm or Rotterdam Conventions are not used, 

except in specific situations identified in national best 

practice guidelines. The use of such pesticides shall be 

minimised and eliminated as part of a plan, and shall 

only be used in exceptional circumstances in ways that 

do not endanger health or the environment.

(increase of pest outbreak), although the quantity used is 

still at a very low level, below 0.5 kg/ha/year.

A slight increase of herbicide used was also observed; this 

is due to paraquat being phased out in 2016. GAR remains 

committed to reducing the quantity of pesticides used in 

the plantations, and research on practices to reduce their 

utilisation is being intensified.

In parallel to minimising the use of chemical pesticides, 

GAR is promoting the use of biopesticides, to enhance 

the health condition of the soils and the palm trees.

DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS 

(SDGS) IN THE COMMUNITY (413-1, 412-1, 411-1, 103-2)

The palm oil industry has helped to advance socio-

economic development in tropical developing countries 

like Indonesia and plays a key role in improving the lives 

of communities living in rural areas. The challenge is to 

ensure that this development is inclusive and sustainable. 

As one of the largest palm oil companies in Indonesia, 

we have created thousands of jobs in rural areas, helping 

to deliver SDGs such as tackling poverty by boosting 

incomes and standards of living. We collaborate with a 

wide range of stakeholders to carry out our social and 

community programmes across all our plantations, which 

deliver SDGs such as providing education and ensuring 

health and well-being, infrastructure and reducing 

inequalities.

We recognise the establishment of plantations creates 

changes for local communities and indigenous people. 

We are committed to respecting human rights and fulfilling 

Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) requirements 

before any operations begin (GAR voluntarily stopped 

all new nucleus estate development in November 2014). 

GAR is also committed to improving its processes and 

procedures with regards to respecting the customary 

rights of local and indigenous communities. In addition 

to FPIC, all of our plantations (100 percent) have social 

community engagement and development plans. 

The active participation and support of these communities 

is also essential for other aspects of sustainability. We 

seek to engage local communities in forest conservation, 

and take an inclusive and collaborative approach to 

addressing our sustainability challenges through our 

community conservation partnerships. This is detailed in 

the chapter on Environmental Management. 

While ensuring that the development of our industry 

is aligned with the interests of local communities, we 

also attempt to multiply the positive socio-economic 

impacts of our operations by promoting entrepreneur 

development and micro-enterprises in local communities. 

In 2017, we commissioned the Rainforest Alliance to 

carry out a verification of our GSEP implementation in 

three concessions in West Kalimantan where the widest 

range of GSEP implementation activities are being 

carried out. This includes a consideration of how we 

are implementing social and community engagement 

activities including FPIC. 

 

RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREE, PRIOR AND 

INFORMED CONSENT (FPIC) (413-1, 412-1)

FPIC is a central tenet of the GSEP and part of our 

commitment to upholding human and community rights 

and we implement this in all our plantations. Respecting 

FPIC means we ensure that decision-making by indigenous 

peoples and local communities regarding the presence of 

our operations is done without pressure and intimidation 

(free), performed before an activity that has impact on the 

surrounding communities is carried out (prior), and with 

sufficient knowledge about the activity and its impact 

on the surrounding communities (informed), so they 

may express agreement or disagreement to such activity 

(consent).

For land acquisition, the implementation of this policy 

includes:

• 

Participatory Mapping and Land Tenure Study of all 

indigenous peoples and local community lands prior 

to negotiation

• 

Social 

Impact 

Assessments 

carried 

out 

using 

participatory methods, the results of which will be 

publicly available and actively shared with relevant 

stakeholders

• 

Engaged and open negotiation processes

• 

Documented agreements signed by and shared with 

all relevant parties

The approach aims to protect community rights to keep 

their forests and agricultural lands, and to ensure that food 

security is never compromised by land being converted 

for plantations. We support the Food and Agriculture 

Organisation’s Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible 

Governance of Tenure which promotes secure tenure 

rights and equitable access to land, fisheries and forests 

as a means of eradicating hunger and poverty, supporting 

sustainable development and protecting the environment. 

Under our FPIC Standard Operational Procedures (SOP) 

we are required to follow a process of socialisation 

when granted a location permit (Ijin Lokasi) for a new 

plantation. The socialisation process involves informing 

communities of the licenses, government and company 

policies regarding land compensation, development 

plans, land valuation approach, process of verifying land 

ownership and requirement for proof of ownership, and 

procedures for land measurements and compensation.

After the socialisation, we ensure that all communities 

have understood and accept what the company has 

communicated, explained and offered during the 

process. When the necessary due diligence is completed, 

compensation will be made to those who have accepted 

the offer. Members of local government document and 

witness any land transfers that take place.

As part of our efforts to ensure that FPIC is implemented 

properly, in 2016 we began FPIC remediation in our 

concessions in West Kalimantan following feedback 

that initial FPIC requirements were not fully met. This 

process has been carried out with local CSO, LINKS, 

implementation partner TFT and Ekologika consultants 

involving fresh consultations with local communities and 

Participatory Mapping to ensure that the community’s 

land rights are fully respected. Amongst other things, this 

mapping verified that areas which had previously been

Widjaja in 2006) and the Tzu Chi Foundation in Indonesia 

(affiliated with the non-denominational global Tzu Chi 

organisation established in Taiwan) on some of these 

programmes. 

ENSURING ACCESS TO EDUCATION (103-2)

Educational initiatives are a key element of our 

community programmes as we believe that this is a 

powerful enabler, helping to break the cycle of poverty 

in rural areas. We have always strived to provide 

children living in our concessions with access to quality 

education. 

In line with the nine years of compulsory education 

required by the Indonesian government, we ensure 

that each estate has educational facilities ranging from 

kindergarten to sixth grade. Additionally, we make sure 

that every region has a junior high school for the children 

of our employees and local communities. 

ADDRESSING COMMUNITY CONCERNS IN PT 

KARTIKA PRIMA CIPTA (PT KPC), WEST KALIMANTAN

GAR has continued to make progress on resolving the 

concerns of the community in PT KPC which involve 

FPIC issues. See latest updates on RSPO website: 

http://www.rspo.org/members/complaints/status-of-

complaints/view/75

Throughout 2016, GAR continued public consultations 

with the communities in PT KPC to address 

concerns especially those related to land tenure. 

Two communities have signed MOUs with GAR on 

community development and FPIC remediation. 

In addtion, GAR commissioned the Rainforest Alliance 

in early 2017 to carry out a verification on the GSEP 

implementation in three concessions including PT 

KPC. The findings will be used to improve GAR’s 

implementation of its responsible practices including 

FPIC.

RESPONSIBLE CONFLICT RESOLUTION (411-1)

Our policies and practices are designed to minimise 

the likelihood of any conflicts related to our operations. 

However, when these conflicts do arise, we are committed 

to working towards a responsible resolution.

We have worked with relevant stakeholders to put in 

place a balanced, accountable, mutually agreed and 

documented conflict resolution system that is accessible 

to smallholders, indigenous peoples, rural communities 

and other parties potentially affected by our operations.

Our conflict management system maps all conflicts 

related to our operations, and develops action plans to 

address them. It incorporates transparent monitoring and 

reporting, the option for local community and customary 

groups to access independent legal and technical advice, 

the ability for complainants to choose individuals or 

groups to support them or act as observers, as well as the 

option of a third party mediator. We categorically reject 

the use of violence in any dispute. 

In 2016, we closed two social conflicts following 

intense consultation with the local communities, local 

governments and with the help of external parties such 

as the RSPO and local CSOs. The resolution of two cases 

in Biru Maju and Karang Mendapo were highlighted in 

SR2015. The case histories on the GAR website detail our 

efforts in finding collaborative and consultative ways to 

resolve disputes with local communities.

economic 

empowerment programmes. This is also in line with the 

achievement of SDGs. 

Aside from government agencies and local communities, 

we work with the Eka Tjipta Foundation (a non-profit

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016


All children of our workers living on our estates receive 

free education from kindergarten to junior high school 

and heavily subsidised higher education. We also offer 

heavily subsidised education at all levels for children 

living near and around our estates. We provide free 

school bus services so that children are able to get to 

school daily.

In 2016, GAR supported 217 schools ranging from 

kindergarten to senior high. These schools employ 

over 1,600 teachers who educate more than 28,200 

students. We also donated books, teaching and learning 

materials and facilities to over 6,100 students in Central 

Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, Jambi and West Kalimantan 

during the year.

We ensure that the educational facilities in our 

concessions are continuously improved. Working with 

the Indonesia Heritage Foundation as a facilitator, 

we have carried out Class Observation programmes 

aimed at evaluating and upgrading the skills of 

elementary school teachers from our concessions 

across Indonesia.

Another programme focusing on training for teachers 

and school management is the Sekolah Eka Tjipta (Eka 

Tjipta School) programme conducted in collaboration 

with the Eka Tjipta Foundation. Amongst other things 

English language training is provided so that students 

gain a competitive advantage. To date, 45 schools in 

Central, East and West Kalimantan have participated in 

the programme.

RUMAH PINTAR PROGRAMME (413-1)

In 2011, GAR started building Rumah Pintar (Smart 

House) in some of our concessions, in support of the 

programme launched by Indonesia’s former First Lady, 

Mrs. Ani Yudhoyono. The goal of the programme is to 

help create educated and prosperous communities 

throughout Indonesia. Each Rumah Pintar functions as 

a community learning centre with special focus on early 

childhood education and the education of women. The 

Rumah Pintar contains a library, play room and an arts 

and culture corner. It is also equipped with computers 

and multimedia stations. We have built 23 Rumah Pintar 

across our plantations in Indonesia to date.

SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMMES

In 2016, GAR contributed more than US$1.8 million 

towards several scholarship programmes. In Indonesia, 

these programmes included Tjipta Pemuda Bangun 

Palma, SMART Engineer, SMART Diploma, SMART Planters 

and other programmes in collaboration with the Bandung 

Institute of Technology and Science (ITSB) as well as 

the Eka Tjipta Foundation. We also made contributions 

to the Singapore University of Technology and Design, 

the Peking University Education Foundation (USA) and 

TsingHua Education Foundation.

COMMUNITY PROGRAMMES (413-1)

GAR collaborates with the Tzu Chi Foundation on many 

community programmes especially those which assists 

the needy. Our initiatives in 2016 included:

• 

Free medical and dental services for over 4,900 

patients in Central Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, 

Lampung, Riau, South Kalimantan, South Sumatra, 

West Kalimantan

• 

Mobilisation of over 310 medical personnel in 150 

plantation clinics to provide free treatment for more 

than 700 patients daily

• 

Surgery for over 440 patients with conditions such as 

harelip, hernia and cataracts, etc.

• 

Health 

education, 

environmental, 

and 

other 

awareness programmes for over 3,500 participants in 

Bangka, Belitung, Central Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, 

Jambi, North Sumatra, South Kalimantan and West 

Kalimantan

• 

Providing support for child health and nutrition (including 

vaccination, multivitamins and supplementary feeding) 

to about 5,100 beneficiaries in Bangka, Belitung, Central 

Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, Jambi, Lampung, South 

Kalimantan, West Kalimantan and West Java

• 

Providing aid for more than 1,200 victims of forest 

fire and flood in East Kalimantan, Jambi, Near Jakarta, 

Riau, South Kalimantan and South Sumatra. We 

distributed over 9,000 aid packages which contain 

basic necessities such as: cooking oil, instant noodles, 

rice, eggs as well as clothes

MEET THE VILLAGE HEAD: PAK SURYADI

The level of education used to be very basic. Before 

the palm oil plantation opened, only the children 

of parents working in the civil service or business 

could send their kids to university. But now, many 

more high school graduates are able to continue 

their education at university.

PROMOTING SMALL AND MICRO ENTERPRISES (413-1)

Our operations and plantations play an important role as 

an economic driver and have led to the development of 

various businesses in the remote areas of Indonesia. 

We actively help promote small and micro enterprises that 

contribute to increased income for the community. One 

such programme is the development of a community 

soy milk processing business in Siak, Riau. A business 

called “Rays Rungau” has been established and is able 

to produce 40 litres of soy milk two to three times a 

week. The business has managed to secure many regular 

customers, including workers and local community 

around the plantation.

We are also helping to boost the income of local 

communities through a goat breeding programme 

launched in eight villages around PT Ivo Mas Tunggal in 

Riau. The goats are kept in a cage or pen which helps 

ensure they receive better care, nutrition and regular 

health checks by veterinarians. 

The Company supported the construction of a goat cage 

and water pump and donated 20 goats. Over the next two 

years, it is expected that another 20 goats will be bred. 

These will then be given to a Farmers Group in another 

village to extend the scheme. 

PROVIDING INFRASTRUCTURE AND COMMUNITY 

FACILITIES (413-1)

GAR seeks to meet the needs of our employees and 

the people living near our operations, by: building and 

maintaining public infrastructure including roads, bridges, 

community hall (for cultural activities) and places of 

worship such as mosques and churches; providing 

the facilities and know-how to run cooperatives that 

ensure basic necessities are available at affordable 

prices; construction and rehabilitation of well-built 

accommodation and health, education and sporting 

facilities; and providing financial help for communities to 

celebrate festive and religious events.

In 2016, we started construction of a new classroom at 

the Belawan Government Elementary School, as well 

as renovating other parts of the school. We also began 

the construction of a religious education facility (Taman 

Pendidikan Al-Quran) in Tarjun village. Renovation and 

construction activities in 2016 were also carried out at the 

Pentakosta Church in Belawan; Tarjun Village’s market 

and meeting hall; Segara Makmur village and Nurul Iman 

Mosque at Marunda Village. 

OUR EMPLOYEES IN THE COMMUNITY 

We involve and mobilise our staff for various causes. 

For example, we urge employees and tenants at our 

corporate headquarters in Jakarta and our operations 

units in Central Kalimantan, South Kalimantan, East 

Kalimantan, Lampung, Riau and West Kalimantan to 

participate in regular blood donation drives for the 

Indonesian Red Cross. More than 2,300 blood donors 

comprising employees and members of local community 

participated in 2016. We also encourage our employees 

to contribute funds regularly to the Tzu Chi Foundation. A 

dedicated team oversees the distribution and responsible 

use of these donations.

RECOGNISING, RESPECTING AND STRENGTHENING 

WORKERS’ RIGHTS (103-2)

We believe in fair, equal and respectful treatment for all of 

our employees. It is in this belief that our main subsidiary 

in Indonesia, SMART signed the United Nations Global 

Compact (UNGC) in 2006. Through the GSEP, we have 

also reinforced our commitment to ensuring that the 

44

GOLDEN AGRI-RESOURCES LTD


rights of all people working in our operations are respected 

according to local, national and ratified international 

laws. We adhere to all Indonesian labour laws covering 

issues such as freedom of association for our employees, 

decent pay and working hours, non-discrimination and 

the complete elimination of child and forced labour. 

Where legal frameworks are not yet in place we defer to 

the International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on 

Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. 

Our commitment to fair labour practices is also 

emphasised in our employee handbook and employment 

practices. The Company has an equal opportunities 

policy on employment, banning discrimination based on 

race, national origin, religion, disability, gender, sexual 

orientation, union membership and political affiliation. 

Employees enter into employment freely. We do not 

require our employees to deposit identity papers nor 

money. Some employees join through pre-employment 

training or education programmes paid for by the 

Company, whereby they agree to work for the Company 

upon completion of their training programme. Upon 

graduation, they are assigned to different estates or mills 

throughout Indonesia and earn an income without any 

deduction in their salary. These conditions are thoroughly 

explained to potential candidates before they make their 

decision to join the programme. 

PAYING FAIR WAGES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (103-2)

All employees of GAR receive a wage that is equal to 

or above the minimum wage set for their province, in 

addition to a range of additional benefits. 

Minimum wages in Indonesia are set by provincial and 

district authorities, which check the local prices of 

goods and services and the amount therefore required 

for living.

Full-time 

workers 

on 

our 

plantations 

earned 

approximately IDR 91,421 per day in wages, excluding 

incentives and non-cash benefits in 2016. Through 

incentives, our employees have the opportunity to 

earn progressively higher incomes depending on 

skill level and productivity. In addition, they receive 

free healthcare for themselves and family, company 

housing, water, electricity and free education for their 

children from kindergarten to junior high.

receiving such non-cash benefits. In 2016, GAR spent IDR 

123.7 billion procuring 13.4 tonnes of rice for our workers. 

Our part-time workers were paid around IDR 87,259 per 

day on average in 2016. In addition, they receive free 

medical services at our polyclinics and their children have 

access to education at our estate schools.

GENDER EQUALITY (103-2)

We believe in promoting gender equality in the workplace. 

However, the manual nature of agricultural work means 

that certain jobs continue to be more suited to male rather 

than female employees. Male workers perform heavier 

physical tasks such as harvesting FFB and carrying them 

to trucks for transport to the mills; women generally work 

on weeding and collecting loose fruit that have fallen on 

the ground. 

Traditional rural employment patterns also mean that 

many women prefer to take on part-time jobs, as it gives 

them the flexibility and time for other responsibilities such 

as tending to the household, childcare and family gardens. 



MEET THE ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEER:  

IBU NOVIANTI

Almost 70 percent of oil palm fresh fruit bunches 

becomes waste once crude palm oil (CPO) is 

extracted. We are referring to waste such as fibres 

and shells, as well as liquid effluent. So a big part 

of my job is to reuse, reduce, recycle, and manage 

this “waste” responsibly—I play an important role in 

producing palm oil sustainably. Most are surprised 

to see a woman working as an environmental 

engineer in this male-dominated industry but 

it doesn’t faze me. I studied environmental 

engineering at Diponegoro University, which was 

male-dominated too. I like the challenge and I’m 

proud of the work I do. It is quite extraordinary— 

I turn waste into something useful.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016


Work Environment and Industrial Relations 

We have zero tolerance for sexual harassment and we 

conduct extensive training for all estate and mill workers 

to ensure this is understood. Gender committees with 

representatives from labour unions and management 

have been set up to promote female participation and 

advancement in the workplace. These committees also 

handle sexual harassment complaints. When a case of 

harassment is reported either formally or informally, the 

relevant committee investigates to determine whether 

further sanctions or law enforcement actions are needed. 

During the investigation, the committee also provides 

assistance and support to the victim. In 2016, no cases of 

harassment or abuse were reported. 

PROHIBITING CHILD LABOUR (103-2, 408-1)

The minimum age for employment in GAR in any capacity 

is 18 years. We are against any form of child labour, and we 

rigorously enforce these principles at all our plantations, 

mills and other places of work. Our recruitment officers 

check the identification card against the prospective 

employee’s schooling records, such as their school 

diploma, to ensure that we do not employ children. We 

also provide schools and day care centres for our workers’ 

children to ensure that parents have somewhere safe to 

send their children and do not feel the need to take their 

children to work with them. 

We are also at the early stages of communicating and 

engaging with our supply chain on our stand against child 

labour, and this is part of our effort to help our supply chain 

comply with the GSEP and adopt responsible practices.  

FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND TRADE UNION 

MEMBERSHIP (102-41, 103-2, 103-3, 408-2)

Freedom of association is mandated by Indonesian Law 

and Regulation No. 21/2000 on Trade/Labour Unions 

and is in line with International Labour Organization 

Convention No. 98 on the freedom of organisation and 

collective bargaining. 

Each of our units has union representatives, elected 

by members, who meet with local management 

representatives regularly in bipartite forums, to 

discuss and resolve issues. In 2016, there were 189 

labour unions representing 47,909 non-management 

employees (85.8 percent) across our plantations 

in Indonesia. We seek to maintain peaceful and 

productive industrial relations through open dialogue, 

fair labour practices, and respectful communication in 

the workplace. 

MONITORING, EVALUATION AND CONTINUOUS 

IMPROVEMENT (103-2)

In 2015, we updated our sustainability policy to make 

it more holistic and wide-ranging. Under the GSEP, 

responsible and ethical practices extend not only to the 

environment and local communities, they also extend 

to the people who work for us. In the GSEP, we have 

consolidated our commitments on human rights, free 

and fair labour practices as well as our stand against child 

and forced labour.   

To ensure practices on the ground are aligned with our 

commitments and international norms, we commissioned 

non-profit organisation, Business for Social Responsibility 

(BSR), to assess human rights and labour practices in 

three of our operations in a six-month project starting 

October 2016.  

BSR’s initial findings show that GAR has strong policies 

and procedures in place.  Workers have a good awareness 

of company policies and their rights as well as their 

access to labour unions. GAR’s gender committees raise 

awareness about sexual harassment and what to do about 

it in line with the company’s Zero Tolerance Policy for all 

forms of harassment and abuse.   

To guard against use of forced labour, GAR practices 

ethical recruitment and prohibits the retention of identity 

documents while ensuring workers have written contracts. 

GAR has a strict policy of only hiring workers who are 18 

and above. Free education and day care centres provided 

by GAR help ensure that children stay in school or are 

looked after while their parents are working, so that they 

do not take their children to work with them.  

Workers are also aware of available grievance mechanisms 

and avenues such as labour unions, gender committees 

and complaint channels. In general, BSR found workers 

were satisfied with housing, educational and healthcare 

facilities and other community infrastructure such as 

places of worship. 

Potential areas for improvement includes strengthening 

communication and clarification to workers about their 

contract status, wage structures and career progression.

A “No Exploitation” site visit was also carried out by our 

implementation partner TFT in one of our concessions 

in Sumatra in February 2016. The purpose was identify if 

there were any social issues and if so, recommendations 

on remedial action by GAR. The TFT team reported findings 

similar to the BSR initial assessment which was that GAR 

had put in place various benefits for workers, backed up 

by strong policies and procedures and there was good 

socialisation of these to the workers. A few potential 

areas for improvement included the identification and 

use of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 

in all roles and ensuring the contents of first aid kits are 

modified based on risk and in stored in close proximity of 

all high risk roles. 

These and BSR’s final assessment results in 2017 will 

provide GAR with information needed to close any gaps 

between policy commitment and practice. 

CREATING A SAFE AND HEALTHY WORKPLACE (103-2, 

103-3)

With thousands of people working for us, we take our 

responsibility in providing a safe and healthy workplace 

very seriously and our Occupational Health and Safety 

management is aimed at minimising workplace accidents, 

fatalities and other negative health impacts.  

 

46

GOLDEN AGRI-RESOURCES LTD


Our updated Health and Safety policy promotes OHS 

through: 

• 

Creating awareness on health and safety management 

amongst our staff and related stakeholders

• 

Ensuring compliance with government regulations 

and related guidelines

• 

Adopting health and safety practices as part of the 

GAR’s operating procedures

• 

Identifying and managing operational risks to prevent 

and reduce work-related accidents or illness 

• 

Regular monitoring and evaluation to continually 

improve our OHS performance

We currently have nearly 220 dedicated OHS experts 

within our workforce and conduct periodic training for 

all employees in accordance with national regulations. In 

2016, 55,800 of our employees received OHS training.

Each of our units has an OHS Supervisory Committee, 

which promotes co-operation between management and 

employees on OHS and complies with Law No. 1 of 1970 

on Occupational Safety. On average, the committees 

for our plantations and mills have 40 members, with 60 

percent worker representation. 

Additionally, our Indonesian operations under SMART 

is certified under the SMK3 (Sistem Manajemen 

Keselamatan dan Kesehatan Kerja) OHS management 

system, in recognition of good OHS management and 

implementation. Six mills have been reviewed and certified 

under SMK3. These certifications are valid for three years 

and a fresh audit is carried out prior to renewal. 

MONITORING THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF 

ACCIDENTS (403-2)

Reducing the Frequency Rate (FR) and Severity Rate (SR) 

of accidents at our sites is a key objective of our OHS 

programme. FR refers to the number of accidents in 

one million hours of work, while the SR is the number 

of workdays lost in one million hours of work within the 

year. Such indicators help us track the effectiveness of 

measures taken to improve OHS in our operations and 

plantations. 

All units send in monthly reports which details number 

of employees, working days, absentee/non effective days, 

overtime, number of accidents, and lost workdays. These 

are then analysed and the FR and SR are recorded. 

In our Upstream operations, we recorded 805 accidents 

which occurred and 46,520 lost workdays during the 

working hours of 172,320,502 during the year. The 

average FR was 4.67 accidents per million man-hours 

worked and the average SR was 269.96 lost workdays per 

million man-hours worked.

For Downstream operations, we recorded 15 accidents 

which occurred and 6,081 lost workdays during the 

working hours of 17,028,385 during the year. We recorded 

an average FR of 0.88 accidents per million man-hours 

worked and an average SR of 357.11 lost workdays per 

million man-hours worked.

FATALITIES (403-2)

We regret to report that work-related accidents resulted in 

a total of five fatalities 2016 – one in Kalimantan and three 

in Sumatera and one in Java involving a contractor. These 

fatalities were mostly caused by FFB and other parts of the 

palm tree falling on the employees. In each case, we have 

worked to assist the families that were bereaved by these 

tragedies, with financial assistance and support, including 

support submitting BPJS Ketenagakerjaan (Indonesian 

Accident Insurance, Life Insurance, and Pension Fund) claims.

We are committed to eliminating such fatal accidents 

from our operations and to this end, we conducted 

thorough investigations of each accident to uncover 

underlying causes, using expert investigators to help 

develop additional and enhanced safety measures.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE EQUIPMENT 

Every GAR plantation and mill has an Emergency 

Response Team on location, which is fully equipped with 

the following emergency response equipment:

• 

Fire Sprinkler/Flapper

• 

Shovel

• 

Fire extinguishers

• 

Portable tank with fire hose and nozzle

• 

Water tanks

• 

First Aid Kit

• 

Alarm and fire hydrant in the mill

• 

Personal equipment for the team including clothes, 

gloves, head lamp, helmet and fireproof shoes

• 

Radio and megaphone for communication

• 

Several estates also have watch towers, fire trucks and 

ambulances

Our Emergency Response Teams conduct regular 

training sessions to ensure that workers are fully prepared 

to respond to any emergencies. We have currently trained 

around 10,000 Emergency Response personnel who are 

stationed across our plantations.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY TRAINING (103-2)

The Company periodically conducts both in-house and 

external training programmes for the entire workforce. 

In 2016, employees attended a number of such trainings 

including Accident Investigation Training, Fire Protection 

System Training – National Fire Protection Assosiation 

(NFPA) and Contractor Safety Management System 

Training (CSMS).

SECURITY GUARDS (103-2, 103-3, 410-1)

The safety of our workers and their families is of utmost 

importance, particularly in isolated rural areas. We 

employ security guards for our operations in Indonesia 

to ensure that the plantations and surrounding 

communities are secure. Our security guards are 

required to undergo a 21-day comprehensive training 

programme by the Bhakti Manunggal Karya Centre of 

Education and Training (BMK). Upon completion, they 

receive a certificate from the Indonesian National Police. 

The programme covers human rights standards as well 

as professional ethics.

Our security guards do not carry firearms but are 

equipped with standard defensive security tools such as 

batons and handcuffs.

HEALTHCARE AND WELL-BEING  

We are committed to providing our entire workforce 

with access to healthcare, including in remote rural areas 

where there is less incentive for healthcare professionals 

to practice. All our estates have polyclinics where workers 

can get free healthcare. 

The medical care that our facilities provide includes 

pre-employment medical check-ups for new recruits, 

and special medical check-ups for workers who are 

exposed to potential health and safety hazards. The 

medical check-up programme is part of our effort to 

prevent and treat work-related illnesses through early 

detection.

PROVIDING TRAINING AND DEVELOPING OUR 

PEOPLE (404-1, 404-2)

GAR sees training and development as an investment that 

delivers benefits to both employees and the employer.

We spent a total of US$4.79 million in 2016 on training 

and development in our Indonesian operations. We 

deliver training both formally and informally, with the 

formal training curriculum taught at six regional training 

centres across Indonesia.

Our training and development programmes have two 

main objectives: equipping employees with the skills and 

capabilities they need to excel in their roles at GAR, and 

ensuring that all employees embrace our corporate values. 

Our learning and development department works closely 

with our business leaders to identify training needs and 

develop high quality training materials and programmes 

to meet those needs.

Training is compulsory for management employees 

at every level starting from the Basic Management 

Development Programme for new starters to the 

Supervisory Management Development programme, 

Middle Management Development Programme and 

Executive Development Programme. The Individual 

Development Plan and Staff Development Discussion 

provided by Talent Centre are trainings that are offered 

regularly for all employees, with public training also 

available to those requiring additional, external training.

In line with our commitment to continuous improvement, 

we have continued to increase training opportunities for 

our staff. Over 12,000 staff received training in 2016. 

We also provide ongoing training on the GSEP. In 2016, 

over 8,500 employees received GSEP training.

In order to nurture our workforce, we seek to identify high 

performing candidates for leadership development and 

provide them with relevant training to help them progress 

in their careers. We are guided by ISO 10015 (Quality 

Management – Guidelines for Training), for which we 

received certification in 2013.

TRANSFORMING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN (308-1, 414-1)

Since we extended the scope of our sustainability policy 

in 2014, we have been focusing on bringing our supply 

chain along with us on our sustainability journey through 

dialogue and engagement. This is essential if we are to 

ensure that the palm oil industry increasingly adopts and 

strengthens responsible practices. 

The launch of our Traceability to the Plantation (TTP) 

exercise in 2016 is enabling us to reach out to a greater 

number of our suppliers including middlemen and 

smallholders. Our Traceability to the Mill process enabled 

us to map all the mills supplying our eight downstream 

processing locations in Indonesia – in 2016 these 

numbered 429 independent mills and 45 GAR-owned 

mills. Working with these mills we are now mapping the 

supply chain all the way back to origin. 

To deal with the complexity of mapping potentially thousands 

of smallholders supplying Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFB), we 

conducted a pilot at our Ujung Tanjung mill in 2016. This 

allowed us to design efficient traceability processes to be 

shared with our other mills as well as third-party suppliers. 

The traceability exercise offers us crucial information 

about the provenance of our raw materials, improving 

our transparency to buyers and customers. Prior to the 

TTP exercise, GAR mills already knew the source of 90 

percent of their FFB and we are on track to complete the 

mapping exercise for GAR mills by end 2017. In 2016, 

15 GAR mills achieved full TTP, and overall GAR mills 

achieved 88 percent TTP. Third-party supplier mills will 

have till 2020 to complete mapping to the plantation. The 

latest mapping and supplier data can be viewed on the 

Sustainability Dashboard. 

ENGAGING OUR SUPPLIERS (103-1, 103-2, 414-2, 308-2)

Beyond traceability, GAR is using the increased interaction 

with suppliers to spread responsible palm oil practices 

and build supplier capability to adopt these practices. 

We are carrying out a programme of supplier visits which 

enables us to build a complete picture of where our suppliers 

stand with regards to responsible practices, and what 

help they need to address the gaps. In 2016 we visited 29 

suppliers to assess their social and environmental practices, 

bringing the total of suppliers visited to 36 since 2015. 

A report on our visits to the Belawan refinery area where 

the largest concentration of supplier mills are located can 

be viewed on our Sustainability Dashboard. The visits were 

carried out together with our implementation partner, TFT. 

A range of similar systemic challenges were found amongst 

our suppliers. 

To address some of these systemic issues we kicked off 

two inaugural SMART SEED workshops for our suppliers 

in 2016, offering them an avenue to meet government, 

CSOs and other experts on critical issues such as how 

to obtain ISPO certification. The workshops were well-

attended with over 80 companies turning up for each 

event. These gatherings also allow suppliers to share 

experiences and learn from each other and GAR. 

In 2017, we are planning workshops and training to 

address other concerns such as the conservation of the 

Leuser Ecosystem, home to several endangered species 

in Aceh and North Sumatera.

In urgent cases, we have assisted suppliers with remedial 

action plans to tackle issues ranging from orangutan 

conservation to land tenure issues and community-based 

fire prevention programmes. Successful case studies can 

be viewed on the GAR website. 

A dedicated GAR Supplier Support Team is available to 

respond to queries from suppliers. The members of the 

team have different backgrounds and expertise in areas 

such environmental assurance, law and traceability and 

are a valuable resource for our suppliers as they seek to 

comply with the commitments laid out in the GSEP. 

These engagement and support efforts will ultimately 

help build a more resilient supply chain and industry. 

EXCERPT FROM BELAWAN REFINERY 

SUSTAINABILITY OVERVIEW REPORT

With all suppliers visited, challenges were found 

across all criteria employed for suppliers’ sustainability 

performance during the site assessment. In particular, 

it was found that suppliers and their FFB supply base 

had significant gaps in their sustainability practices 

related to minimising environmental impacts, no 

development of and the conservation of HCV and HCS 

areas; legal compliance, traceability, transparency, 

and respecting workers’ rights.  

Deeper analysis of suppliers’ operations revealed 

two underlying reasons behind their difficulties in 

embedding sustainability into their business practices: 

1. A lack of understanding of the value of 

sustainability leading to lack of or insufficient 

sustainability policies and procedures and;

2. Limited organisational support.

GAR’s aim is thus to develop a better understanding 

and appreciation of how sustainability is an essential 

pre-requisite of any supplier and to empower them 

to address the issues uncovered and help transform 

the supply chain. Broad (multiple supplier groups) 

and deep (individual supplier) engagement initiatives 

will be rolled out by GAR across their supply base: 

supplier gatherings; toolkits &amp; templates; training &amp; 

coaching; and engagements with a wider stakeholder 

audience (including beyond the palm oil industry).

FOSTERING RESPONSIBLE PALM OIL PRODUCTION 

AMONGST OUR PLASMA SMALLHOLDERS

GAR has been supportive of the plasma scheme since 

1990 and there are 68,600 plasma smallholders1 in our 

concessions in Indonesia. They supplied about 22 percent 

of our total intake of FFB in 2016. 

While the Company does not own the plasma plantations, 

they are very closely integrated into our management 

system and we take the lead in promoting their success and 

productivity. In 2016, our plasma smallholders achieved a 

CPO yield of around 4.4 tonnes per hectare, higher than 

the national average of 3.5 tonnes per hectare. 

Through 

their 

partnership 

with 

us, 

our 

plasma 

smallholders have access to high-yielding seeds and 

good quality fertilisers. We also ensure knowledge 

transfer and capacity building through regular training on 

Good Agricultural Practices. 

IMPROVING FARMER LIVELIHOODS 

We estimate that thousands of independent farmers are 

included in GAR’s supply chain – we are currently in 

the process of mapping them. An estimated two million 

small farmers control around 44 percent of palm oil 

estates in Indonesia. GAR’s plasma smallholders enjoy 

the benefits of better quality seeds and advanced 

agronomic practices and estate management. This 

makes their yield comparable to the main nucleus 

estates. In contrast, independent smallholders, some of 

whom own plots as small as one or two hectares, tend 

towards low yields of two to three tonnes per hectare. 

This is about half the yield in GAR’s prime estates. 

Inefficient production is a concern because of its 

negative impact on a farmer’s livelihood which can lead 

to increased pressure to clear more forests for agriculture 

in the hopes of boosting earnings. 

GAR believes the solution lies in being able to convince 

independent farmers to replant with high quality seeds, 

which could lead them to double or triple their yields on 

existing plots. However, farmers face several obstacles, 

chief of which is the inability to access bridging loans. 

Innovative Financing was introduced as a solution in 

2014 by the Government of Indonesia and the Indonesian 

Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN). By joining 

the scheme, independent farmers can get loans at 

affordable interest rates, training in the latest agronomy 

practices and a supply of quality certified seeds. The 

financing helps them bear the cost of replanting, enabling 

them to get materials such as seeds and fertiliser as well 

as helping to support their livelihoods during the four 

years it takes for palm trees to mature. 

GAR has been a keen supporter and early adopter of the 

scheme since its launch and has frequently called on 

the rest of the industry and related stakeholders to help 

support the scheme. In 2016, GAR helped independent 

farmers near our operations in Riau and Jambi secure 

loans of approximately IDR 107 Billion from a state-

owned bank. We are also helping farmers obtain ISPO 

certification for 1,300 hectares of estates in the two 

provinces. As at end 2016, GAR had helped over 430 

farmers participate in the scheme and replanting for the 

latest batch of smallholders began in March 2016. 

We also run other finance and support programmes for 

independent smallholders. Through the Smallholders 

Development Programme, GAR has provided loans 

to more than 1,000 independent farmers in East 

Kalimantan since 2013. This allows them to buy high-

yielding seeds, fertiliser, herbicides and rent heavy 

equipment. To date, we have disbursed more than IDR 

15 billion in loans.



MEET THE FARMER TRAINER: PAK BUDIN

Whenever there’s a question about new farming 

methods, everyone says, “Ask Budin!” As a farmer 

trainer with GAR, I’m usually the first to learn 

about new farming techniques that could help our 

smallholder farmers improve their harvests. 

I have seen the farmers and cooperatives benefit in 

the span of a single harvest cycle. With better plot 

maintenance and fertilisation, and better quality 

harvests, the farmers have increased their earnings 

to IDR five to six million per lot. Today, their yields 

are among the highest in the industry. 

Read more about Pak Budin on the GAR website.

1 Plasma scheme smallholders are bound by a contract or credit agreement to a particular mill or estate owned by a company. At GAR, the 

plasma smallholder plantations are organised, supervised or directly managed by our managers.

GOLDEN AGRI-RESOURCES LTD


We are also building partnerships with customers to help 

improve independent farmers’ sustainability. Neste, one 

of our major customers has inked an agreement with us 

to support smallholder efforts to gain certification. The 

project based in the Siak district in Riau, aims to help 

farmers improve practices to achieve certification which 

will lead to greater market access and better income. 

The initiative will also seek to identify more farmers 

eligible for the Innovative Financing Scheme. 

OTHER SUPPLIERS (204-1)

Aside from the third-party mills, brokers and individual 

farmers which supply CPO and PK to GAR, our other 

significant procurement includes fertilisers which 

we source from 38 Indonesian companies. We also 

procure bulk items such as rice from local businesses 

to distribute to our employees as part of their non-cash 

benefits. 

PROMOTING COMPLIANCE WITH THE GSEP (103-2, 

103-3, 102-17)

As our supply chain includes many small and medium sized 

businesses in Indonesia, we recognise that many of them 

will need help in building capacity to adopt responsible 

practices. This is why we believe that engagement rather 

than exclusion is the best way to promote compliance 

with the GSEP. 

For our independent mill suppliers, we have been 

familiarising them with the GSEP through workshops and 

training sessions. Suppliers are guided through a self-

assessment questionnaire and can also reach out to GAR’s 

Supplier Support Team with questions on compliance. 

 

We have a robust due diligence system and do not 

knowingly source from any suppliers who refuse to 

comply with the GSEP. We also have the option to 

disengage from suppliers who are unwilling to comply 

with the GSEP. 

Our Supplier Code of Conduct was launched in the last 

quarter of 2015. From 2016, all companies seeking 

to become GAR suppliers have to acknowledge that 

they are aware of and understand the GSEP – in 2016, 

over 340 suppliers complied with this requirement. A 

link to our Supplier Code of Conduct is included in 

all purchase orders. Our existing suppliers have also 

submitted Codes of Conduct to show they are aligned 

with our policies. 

We operate a transparent and accountable system where 

stakeholders can inform us of issues within our supply 

chain using our grievance process which is documented 

on the GAR Sustainability Dashboard, allowing us to 

respond in a timely and transparent manner. (See GAR 

Grievance Procedure p23). 

SUPPORTING COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND 

REGULATIONS

GAR also provides guidance and advice on invoicing, 

proper documentation and tax compliance for our 

suppliers.

We conduct training on Indonesian tax requirements 

and encourage suppliers and contractors to register for 

tax when required. We assign employees to work with 

our local contractors and ensure that they prepare their 

invoices properly, avoiding the risk of non-compliance 

and ensuring that there are no delays in payment. 

We audit certain categories of suppliers, especially those 

supplying packaging and raw materials for our products, 

to ensure that they comply with food safety standards.

Any supplier that breaches Indonesian law, including 

those pertaining to health and safety, will have their 

contract terminated immediately. 

ENSURING FAIR TREATMENT OF SUPPLIERS (103-2)

We choose our suppliers in an open and transparent 

manner. We require that all potential suppliers meet 

the same basic legal and commercial requirements, 

complying with tax regulations and the law, and holding a 

Certification of Competence for the type of business they 

are conducting.

We then conduct a transparent procurement process 

with at least three qualified suppliers invited to tender for 

purchases. A Tender Committee makes the decision to 

award the contract based on price, quality and delivery 

capacity. The committee includes representatives from 

Central Procurement and the Business Control Division, 

as well as the relevant operating unit.

We seek to treat our suppliers fairly and ethically, 

particularly with respect to the prompt payment of bills.

Unless otherwise agreed, our payment terms are within 

30 days of receipt of a complete and proper invoice. 

When suppliers present invoices at our head office, 

we check for completeness and accuracy, so that the 

supplier can make the necessary corrections promptly 

and resubmit the documents. Our downstream business 

has implemented a “One-Day Service” to notify suppliers 

within 24 hours if their invoice is incomplete or inaccurate.

This demonstrates our commitment to pay our suppliers 

on time and their importance to our business. We 

understand that some of our small suppliers in rural areas 

face challenges in managing their cash flow. To help 

them, we grant cash advances and expedite payments on 

a case-by-case basis.

Customers and Consumers

OUR CUSTOMERS

The bulk of our palm oil is distributed through our 

customers, 

which 

include 

traders, 

distributors, 

wholesalers, retailers and other businesses in the food 

industry, as well as manufacturing businesses that use 

our oil as a raw material in the production of secondary 

goods. 

We sell our products across the world, with 18 percent 

of our revenues deriving from China, 19 percent from 

India and 11 percent from our customers in Indonesia. 

The rest of Asia contributes 31 percent of our revenues, 

while countries in Europe, Africa and elsewhere account 

for 21 percent.

Ltd (FOSFA) and The Palm Oil Refiners Association of 

Malaysia (PORAM). These contracts set the terms of 

trading, including how payment is made. When we trade 

palm oil on the wholesale market, we use the crude palm 

oil price as the basis of our negotiations with brokers or 

customers. We offer the option of spot or forward market 

prices. All buyers are assessed to ensure that they are 

financially solvent and we require letters of credit to be 

supplied when GAR is to handle the shipping of palm oil.

DELIVERING OUR PRODUCTS

We handle the distribution of palm oil and palm oil 

products through a joint venture with the global 

transportation businesses Stena Weco A/S and Stena Bulk 

AB. Golden Stena Weco (GSW) was formed in 2012, and 

is the only JV between a palm oil company and a shipper 

in the sector, making it unique and offering GAR logistical 

advantages in the market. 

In the past few years, we have increased the size of 

our fleet and developed our logistics infrastructure 

by investing in warehousing, jetty and port facilities in 

important strategic locations. 

GSW has 15 vessels in total with seven under direct 

ownership and eight on Time Charter. The majority of our 

owned vessels are Ship Inspection Report Programme (SIRE) 

and CDI-Marine approved. These two approvals signify the 

vessels are in good condition, in compliance with shipping 

regulations and adhering to sustainable shipping practices. 

All time chartered vessels are vetted thoroughly and their 

technical managers audited by GSW. All GSW vessels 

are also issued guidelines and best practices on energy 

efficiency and conservation. 

PROVIDING SUSTAINABLE CHOICES THROUGH 

CERTIFICATION (102-12)

Our Indonesian operations were early adopters of 

certification of sustainably produced palm oil – SMART 

became a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm 

Oil (RSPO) member in 2005 shortly after RSPO was founded.  

Industry 

certification 

is 

part 

of 

GAR’s 

on-going 

commitment to adopt best practices and standards in 

responsible production while allowing us to meet growing 

demand for certified sustainable palm oil.

ROUNDTABLE ON SUSTAINABLE PALM OIL (RSPO) 

CERTIFICATION (103-2, 103-3)

To date, 262,442 hectares of plantations including 51,149 

hectares of smallholder estates, 29 mills, nine kernel 

crushing plants, five refineries, seven bulking stations 

and one oleo-chemical plant have received RSPO 

certification.

We have extended the time frame for completion of 

RSPO certification until 2020 for the remaining operations 

which includes 213,415 hectares of plantations and 

encompasses 49,233 hectares of plasma estates and 16 

mills. This extension reflects our conservative estimate for 

Our broad customer base incorporates a range of different 

trading relationships. We deal directly with industrial 

customers, and maintain regular communication, tailoring 

our products to their requirements. Our responsibilities 

to these customers include fair pricing and transparent 

processes, traceability, as well as efficient distribution.

We aim to offer an extensive range of products that meet 

the varying needs of our different customers. In recent 

years this has involved GAR extending our product range 

into high-value areas such as palm-based oleochemicals, 

which are used to manufacture soaps, detergents and 

other personal care products.

GAR has also been responding to the growing market 

demand for traceable and certified sustainable palm oil.

the time needed to acquire the HGU or Land Cultivation 

Right and the liability data as required recently by RSPO.

In 2014, we also received certification for having met 

the RSPO-RED Requirements for compliance with the 

EU Renewable Energy Directive Requirements (RSPO-

RED scheme). The certification includes one mill and its 

supply base comprising nucleus and plasma plantations 

in Kijang, Riau.

The RSPO-RED scheme is a voluntary add-on to the RSPO 

standard and allows palm oil producers and processors 

under certain conditions to comply with requirements 

in the EU Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the 

use of energy from renewable sources. This Directive 

specifies sustainability requirements for biofuels and 

bioliquids in the European Union. The milestone marks an 

extension of our commitment to RSPO certification. With 

the RSPO-RED certification, we now offer an alternative 

certified palm oil for biofuel production.

GAR is an active member of RSPO and is part of the Dispute 

Settlement Facility Advisory Group, the Biodiversity and 

HCV Working Group and Innovation Lab. 

INDONESIAN SUSTAINABLE PALM OIL (ISPO)

GAR is supportive of the ISPO Scheme developed 

by the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture to improve 

the competitiveness of Indonesian palm oil in world 

markets and to meet Indonesia’s commitment to reduce 

greenhouse gases and focus on environmental issues. 

To date, 186,307 hectares of plantations and 30 mills have 

received ISPO certification. In December 2016 we were 

recognised by the Indonesian government for having 

obtained the highest number of ISPO certificates in the 

industry. 

INTERNATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY AND CARBON 

CERTIFICATE (ISCC)

To date, 291,351 hectares of plantations including 

smallholder plantations of 57,755 hectares, 29 mills, 

two kernel crushing plants, five refineries and 14 bulking 

stations have received ISCC certification. 

The objectives of the ISCC are the establishment of an 

internationally oriented, practical and transparent system 

for the certification of biomass and bioenergy. ISCC 

is oriented towards the reduction of greenhouse gas 

emissions, the sustainable use of land, the protection of 

natural biospheres and social sustainability.

DEVELOPING A BIOFUEL MARKET FOR PALM OIL

GAR has built two biodiesel plants in South Kalimantan and 

near Jakarta, which extended our product range to include 

the use of palm oil as a biofuel, and is in response to the 

policy of the Indonesian government supporting biofuel 

production. The first biodiesel plant in South Kalimantan 

was completed in 2016 and the second has just begun 

operations in the second quarter of 2017. Together the two 

plants have a total capacity of 600,000 tonnes per annum.

OUR CONSUMERS 

Aside from distributing palm oil to industrial customers, 

we also sell edible oil and food products directly to the 

end consumer in markets like Indonesia and China. 

OUR CONSUMER MARKETS (102-2, 102-6)

Indonesia is our largest consumer market where we sell 

palm oil-based products that are widely used by both 

consumers and commercial customers. These include 

cooking oil brands like Filma and Kunci Mas and margarine 

and shortening products for the baking industry marketed 

under the Filma, Palmboom and Goodfry brands. 

Traditionally, most palm oil-based cooking oil has been 

sold in bulk in Indonesia. However, the Indonesian 

Government favours phasing out the bulk purchasing 

of cooking oil, placing greater importance on consumer 

brands, and ensuring strict hygiene levels, stable prices 

and more consistent tax payments. We welcome their 

efforts to ensure a fair and transparent market for palm 

oil products in the country and we believe that this will 

create opportunities for GAR’s trusted brands.



Our cooking oils are sold across Indonesia

61

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016


Customers and Consumers

In China, we sell palm-based and soybean-based products 

and offer a range of cooking oils, noodles and other 

food products. We look to optimise our oil refineries and 

soybean crushing facilities in the country on a continuous 

basis to meet evolving consumer demand.

We have also entered India, the third largest edible oil 

market, through the ownership of a destination processing 

facility. This asset enables us to participate in high-growth 

branded cooking oil and specialty fat industries in the 

country and also to bring our products closer to greater 

European and Middle East markets. 

Besides those countries, we are expanding the reach 

of our branded consumer products across developing 

markets in the Philippines, Africa and South America 

with the Mitra, Filma and Menara brands, and in 

selected markets, with the Kunci Mas brand (PNG and 

the Pacific islands).

TACKLING MALNUTRITION THROUGH OUR PRODUCTS 

Vitamin A deficiency is a significant public health concern 

in Indonesia, especially amongst women and children. To 

address this the Indonesian Ministry of Industry requires all 

local cooking oil producers to fortify their products with a 

minimum 40 International Units (IU) of Vitamin A per litre. 

GAR has met this requirement across all our products 

distributed in Indonesia and we have also gone further to 

enhance our impact on consumer health. Besides Vitamin 

A, our Filma Margarine is also fortified with vitamins B1, 

B2 and B3. 

ENSURING PRODUCT QUALITY AND CONSUMER 

PROTECTION 

Our consumers rely on GAR brands for safe, high quality 

products that they can trust. We use international 

standards to ensure the quality of our products, bar codes 

for traceability, and we systematically record expiry dates 

and batch data.

Five of our six palm oil refineries in Indonesia are 

accredited 

with 

ISO 

22000 

certification, 

which 

recognises that they adhere to strict international food 

safety standards. Our fatty acid and glycerine products 

also hold OHSAS 18001, KOSHER, GMP+B2, and FDA 

accreditation, and we have also implemented ISO 

9001:2008 Quality Management Systems at all five of 

these sites. We are working to implement the same 

standards at our newest refinery in Lubuk Gaung. We 

are also committed to rolling out the Hazards Analysis 

and Critical Control Point or HACCP food safety system 

across our operations. 

Our products have also been awarded the Halal 

certification from the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI).

We are also carrying out research aimed at addressing 

health concerns about trans fatty acids and potential 

carcinogens in processed palm oil. This R&amp;D is detailed 

in the following chapter.

CONSUMER ENGAGEMENT 

We encourage feedback from our consumers to help 

ensure that our products are meeting their evolving 

needs. Our toll-free customer care line handles 

feedback and any complaints regarding product quality 

and promotions.

We also use digital and social media platforms such 

as Facebook and Twitter to engage our consumer 

communities through our Filma Club and www.

sukamasak.com. Our Marunda refinery also hosts 

a Filma Factory Visit programme, which enables 

consumers to see the production of our branded 

cooking oils first-hand.

R&amp;D Supports Responsible Palm Oil 

At GAR, we believe that harnessing technological 

advances and R&amp;D is a key component in helping us 

achieve responsible palm oil production. In 2016, GAR 

spent almost US$9 million on its R&amp;D activities for both 

upstream and downstream businesses. 

SMART Research Institute (SMARTRI) in Libo, Riau is our 

flagship research facility with around 80 researchers and 

scientists focusing on improving practices in agronomy, 

breeding, crop protection all of which contribute to 

sustainable palm oil production. SMARTRI’s research also 

explores areas such as climate change mitigation.

R&amp;D conducted by SMARTRI has contributed to the 

development of our high-yielding Dami Mas seeds which 

have also been developed to be disease-resistant. These 

seeds support yield improvements on our estates. In 

2016, our nucleus estates achieved a CPO yield of 4.5 

tonnes per hectare for prime estates (seven – 18 years 

old). Our average yield across all nucleus estates was 4.2 

tonnes per hectare compared to the national average of 

3.5. Our plasma smallholders also achieved an overall 

average yield of 4.4 tonnes per hectare.1

We have also developed new clones using non-

GMO techniques. The clones have been registered in 

Indonesia’s Catalogue of Seeds and approved for use by 

the Ministry Agriculture. Over the next five years, we will 

multiply these clones through tissue culture, to cultivate 

a sufficient quantity to plant over a large commercial area 

starting in 2022.

REDUCING DISEASE THROUGH MINERAL NUTRITION 

MANAGEMENT 

The basal stem rot disease of oil palm due to the 

Ganoderma fungus is a serious threat to oil palm 

plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia, as well as parts 

of Africa. Ganoderma infection is widespread in many 

soils including mineral, peat and acid sulphate soils. The 

disease increases with time and replanting cycles - it 

impacts the profitability of the commodity and increases 

the area required to produce the same amount of oil. 

Our plantations have been relatively free of Ganoderma. 

R&amp;D efforts have focused on developing planting material 

with a significant level of resistance to the disease. We 

have been successful in this and our first two varieties 

partially resistant to Ganoderma were officially registered 

in 2015. 

Agronomical practices to lower the impact of the 

disease have also been studied. We have found that a 

proper balance of fertilisers is an important factor that 

slows down the development of the disease. Excessive 

applications of phosphate fertilisers (rock phosphate) 

and to a lesser extent, nitrogen fertilisers (urea), increases 

the development of disease while applications of potash 

fertiliser have a slight opposite effect.

methane capture plans. SMARTRI has also started to look 

at the emissions of nitrous oxide, a gas that is emitted 

from nitrogen fertilisers applied to our palms. Although 

the volume of N2O is generally small, the greenhouse 

impact of this gas is around 300 times higher than 

carbon dioxide.

We are measuring the actual emissions in our plantations 

and testing new practices that could potentially reduce 

them. 

We are also looking at reducing GHG emissions in the 

management of our empty fruit bunches (EFB). Field 

experiments have shown that while composting and 

fresh field applications present similar levels of carbon 

dioxide emission, the rate of nitrous oxide emission was 

much higher during composting compared with field 

applications of fresh EFB. We have found that an addition 

of biochar at the very beginning of composting can 

significantly reduce these nitrous oxide emissions and we 

are now trying to determine the best quantity of biochar 

to mix with EFB to minimise these emissions.

Globally, agricultural activities contribute around 25 

percent of total GHG. Agriculture also has the ability to fix 

carbon in vegetation and fruit biomass as well as in soil as 

organic matter and this can help mitigate climate change.

In order to quantify the situation in oil palm cultivation, 

we have carried out continuous recording of CO2 balance 

since 2011 in a plantation in Sumatra. The results confirm 

that the oil palm agro-system can absorb a significant 

quantity of carbon, reaching between 35 and 42 tonnes 

of CO2 per hectare per year and can therefore contribute 

to mitigation of climate change.

These numbers have been recorded through special 

micrometeorology devices (Eddy covariance system) 

installed on towers high above the canopy of plantations. 

Measurements of carbon dioxide flux are done 

continuously with 10 records per second. GAR is the first 

private company using this high-tech methodology to 

monitor oil palm cultivation carbon balance.

MONITORING PEAT SUBSIDENCE (103-2)

GAR plantations include some limited areas of peat soils 

which were developed prior to our policy of no development 

on peat. We are committed to the optimum sustainable 

management of these areas. Failure to manage peat lands 

can lead to high amount of carbon dioxide emissions. 

Peat lands have to be kept wet and the depth of the 

water table is critical in managing peat. Each commercial 

block in the plantations which contains peat includes a 

network of piezometers to monitor the water table. We 

also monitor and record peat subsidence monthly. 

The results show an average subsidence below five cm 

per year, except for a few sites, where the 2015 El Nino 

effect had a relatively higher impact. 

Generally speaking, subsidence is mainly affected by water 

deficit periods as well as the severity of the dry season. 

During the last two years, more stringent management 

has been implemented in order to minimise the risk of 

higher subsidence during dry seasons, and we believe the 

rate of subsidence will be reduced in the coming years.

R&amp;D TO SAFEGUARD CONSUMER HEALTH (416-1)

Aside from SMARTRI, we have set up a Downstream R&amp;D 

centre to develop a variety of quality edible food products 

using palm oil. 

A major focus of the R&amp;D department has been to develop 

products that address consumer health concerns such 

as the presence of trans fatty acids in processed foods 

which have been linked to heart disease. Transfats are 

generated through a process called hydrogenation. To 

tackle this, our R&amp;D department has reformulated many 

of our products to completely eliminate all trans fatty 

acids, without compromising on quality.

In several cases, developing trans-fat free alternatives has 

enabled us to reduce the total saturated fat. We continue 

to explore other techniques to reduce saturated fatty 

acids by assessing the technical requirements of certain 

formula in specific food products. We are also exploring 

ways of eliminating or minimising minor ingredients 

(E-numbers) or switching to natural alternatives.

These efforts continue to make our margarines, 

shortenings and specialty oils healthier for the consumer.

Starting in 2011, there has been growing awareness 

about new substances identified and known as 2- and 

3-MCPD and esters. The European Food Standards 

Authority (EFSA) has issued a report warning about 

the health consequences of co-contaminants formed 

during processing and refining of all edible oils and 

specifically identified 3-MCPD as a cause for concern.

These 

co-contaminants 

are 

known 

as 

2-monochloropropane-1,3-diol and 3-monochloro-

propane-1, 2-diol and Glycidol/Glycidyl esters (GE), and 

are formed during food production and preparation at 

high temperatures. During refining of palm oil they can 

occur during the deodorisation step. This processing 

step aims to remove unwanted taste and odour to meet 

customer quality and safety specifications. It is possible 

that these substances have been part of the human diet 

since man began eating cooked food.

Several departments including Operations, Quality 

Management and R&amp;D have been working together 

to understand the formation of these substances and 

how to minimise them. We are investigating this issue 

comprehensively, looking at each stage of the oil 

production, from the field to the processing plants. 

We are implementing several mitigation strategies to 

reduce these substances. Together with leading global 

food manufactures, we are using new internationally 

approved identification methods to test for these 

substances. At the same time we have been installing 

and testing new and effective mitigation technologies. 

Although it is complicated, we are using several 

production and process strategies to prevent, or reduce 

the occurrence of these substances.
