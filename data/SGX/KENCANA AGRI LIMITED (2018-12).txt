Table of Contents




Kencana Agri Limited (“Kencana” or “the Group”) is 

an Indonesian plantation company engaged mainly in 

the cultivation of oil palms; processing of Fresh Fruit 

Bunches (FFB) into Crude Palm Oil (CPO), Crude Palm 

Kernel Oil (CPKO), Palm Kernel Cake (PKC) and Palm Kernel 

("PK"); and provision of bulking and logistics services.

Officially listed on the main board of the Singapore 

Exchange ("SGX") on July 25th, 2008, the Group 

manages plantation areas located in the islands of 

Sumatra, Kalimantan and Sulawesi, Indonesia, with 

approximately 67,612 ha of land, including plasma 

areas, 15 estates, 6 palm oil mills (5 in operation, 1 new 

mill in commissioning stage) with a total processing 

capacity of 275 tonnes per hour and 2 kernel crushing 

plants with the capacity of 435 tonnes per day. To 

date, the Group has planted up to 36% of its total 

landbank and aims to continue sustainably expanding 

its planted area. However, the Group’s potential is not 

fully realized yet as 48% of its nucleus palm oil trees 

are still in the immature and young mature stage. 

This relatively young profile of palm oil trees, with a 

weighted average of 10.0 years, will soon enter their 

prime mature phase, driving up the potential for strong 

FFB production growth in the next few years.

As part of its strong commitment in environmental 

aspects of sustainability and Corporate Social 

Responsibility (“CSR”),  two of the Kencana’s 

subsidiaries, PT Sawindo Kencana and PT Alamraya 

Kencana Mas, have been certified by both ISPO and 

International Sustainable and Carbon Certification 

(“ISCC”), while PT Sawit Kaltim Lestari (SKL) attained 

ISPO certification in 2018. The Group strives to 

attain Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (“ISPO”) 

certifications for all its plantations as required by the 

Indonesian government, as well as other sustainability 

certifications. Moreover, the Group has invested in 

three renewable biomass power plants in Bangka-

Belitung Islands, whilst working together with the 

state-owned electricity company, PT Perusahaan 

Listrik Negara (“PLN”) to supply “green” electricity to 

the local community. Our power plants solely run on 

palm kernel shells, fiber mesocarp and empty fruit 

bunches (EFB).

About the 

Company

Kencana Agri Limited


Kencana Agri’s Sustainability Report outlines the 

Group’s sustainability performance throughout the 

period of FY2018. Published annually, this Report 

complies with  SGX regulations, which now requires the 

inclusion of a corporate report on its environmental, 

social and corporate governance factors (“ESG factors”)  

that highlights a listed company’s financial reporting. 

[102-52]

Kencana first published its Sustainability Report from 

FY2015 in August 2016, continued with the publication 

of their second Sustainability Report FY2017 on 

November 30th, 2018. This current Report is our third 

publication of Sustainability Report, covering the 

period starting on January 1st, 2018  up to December 

31st, 2018. [102-50][102-51]

Reporting Guidelines

In preparing this Report, we referred to the standards 

and principles specified in the Global Reporting 

Initiatives (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. 

Out of two reporting options offered by the GRI 

Standards (Core and Comprehensive), Kencana Agri’s 

Sustainability Report 2018 is prepared in accordance 

with the GRI Standards: Core option. [102-54]

To enable quick cross-references to the GRI Standards, 

we have included GRI Standard Core Indicators at each 

relevant sections in this Report to show compliance 

with specific aspects of GRI Standards. A complete 

list of GRI Standards Core Indicators discussed in this 

Report is available at page 87. [102-55]

About this Report



10

About This Report

2018 Sustainability Report


In addition to the GRI Standards, we also prepared 

this Report following the reporting standards and 

requirements specified in the Singapore Stock 

Exchange (SGX) Sustainability Reporting Guideline. 

[102-12]

Determining the  

Report Content [102-46]

GRI Standards offers a set of guidelines to prepare a 

report that is accurate, balanced, clear, comparable, 

reliable and timely. Following these Standards, we start 

the reporting process with Identification of Material 

Aspects and Boundaries, continued with the process 

of assigning Priority Level to the Identified Aspects 

before finally Validating them. Results from the review 

process, which is conducted after the publication 

of each report, will be a basis for the Identification 

process in the next reporting cycle.

We follow the four principles of the GRI Standards 

in our process of defining the content of this Report. 

These four principles are:

1. Stakeholder Engagement

 

Our stakeholders are involved in the reporting 

process, starting from defining report contents, to 

providing input on published Sustainability Reports 

to better capture their interests and expectations.

2. Sustainability Context

 

Our Sustainability Report covers all sustainability 

issues that are material and relevant to the Group 

and our stakeholders at the local, regional or even 

global level which are appropriate to our business 

and operations.  

3. Materiality

 

This Sustainability Report comprises materials 

regarding environmental, social and governance 

factors (“ESG factors”) for the Group's business and 

operations sustainability, as well as ESG factors that 

are substantially impacting the decision-making 

process of related stakeholders.

4. Completeness

 

The Group’s Sustainability Report is prepared within 

a determined reporting period, classified according 

to specific scope and boundaries, and supported by 

relevant data and information.

Material Topics and Boundaries 

This sustainability report emphasizes the issues that 

matter the most. For that reason, in 2018, Kencana 

conducted an update on its materiality matrix to better 

capture material issues/interests of the stakeholders 

and the Group as well as to reflect the current trends 

in the industry. 

These issues are defined based on their impacts on 

our business along with the feedback received from 

the stakeholders through a survey. Issues that ranked 

highest have been reported more thoroughly.

In the process, we collected data and information from 

internal Group and related stakeholders as well as 

included industry insights related to environmental, 

social and governance factors. Results from the survey 

that became the foundation for preparing the Report’s 

materiality matrix are available in the Chapter that 

talks about Sustainability at Kencana Agri.

Presented in this Report are data and information 

covering the Group’s operations throughout Indonesia 

and marketing office in Singapore, excluding activities 

of third parties conducted outside of Kencana's 

operational areas. Data and information on the Group's 

financial performances are taken from the Group's 

Annual Report 2018 covering all subsidiary companies, 

including PT Sawindo Kencana, PT Alamraya Kencana 

Mas, PT Agro Inti Kencanamas, PT Sawit Kaltim Lestari 

and PT Agri Eastborneo Kencana. [102-45]

Reporting Verification  

&amp; Assurance

This 

Sustainability 

Report 

presents 

qualitative 

and quantitative data that are relevant for report 

comparability, transparency, and accountability. To 

ensure the accuracy of the data presented in this 

Sustainability Report, we have implemented thorough 

verification processes and internal reviews.

Particularly for areas that have PROPER, ISPO and 

ISCC certifications, all data and information have been 

submitted to and verified by the authorized bodies.

Moreover, to ensure that this report is developed in 

accordance with GRI Standards Core Option, we have 

conducted GRI Standards accordance check by the 

National Center for Sustainability Reporting (NCSR) 

Indonesia. A third party assurance is currently not 

conducted on this sustainability report but may be 

performed for future reporting. [102-56]

Significant Change  

or Restatement

In our effort to streamline our operations, in 2017 we 

divested our downstream joint venture with Louis 

Dreyfus Company Asia Pte Ltd. This corporate action 

might slight affected our overall production data. Other 

than that, there was no further significant changes 

in relation to the reporting structure, neither to the 

organization, operational, and the Group’s supply 

chain compared to the previous report. There is also 

no restatement of information on this sustainability 

report from previous period. [102-10] [102-48][102-49]

2018 Sustainability Report

"A thriving 

company  

is one that is 

keen and  

dares to  

‘Go Beyond’."

Henry Maknawi 

Executive Chairman




Dear Stakeholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors, it is my pleasure to present Kencana’s 

third sustainability report for the year ended in 31 December 2018.

Sustainable Performance

The year 2018 started with weak production in the first quarter but we 

made a good recovery over the next 3 quarters to achieve a production 

of 782,758MT of FFB for the year. This represents a significant 32% 

increase over last year’s production and a record high for Kencana. 

Total CPO produced also increased by 33.7% from 147,716 tonnes in 

FY2017 to 197,149 tonnes in FY2018. We expect this uptrend to continue 

as the maturity profile of our trees continue to improve along with the 

commissioning of our sixth mill in Sulawesi region. 

Kencana strives to develop its plantation business based on best 

management practices that are sustainable and environmentally friendly, 

whilst reinforcing our responsibilities as a good corporate citizen. We 

recognize that while economic performance is a key driver of business 

sustainability, other drivers such as environmental, social and governance 

(ESG) factors has an equally important impact on our business’ value. Hence 

this year the Group has taken a work moto of ‘Go Beyond’. We believe that 

by going beyond we would be able to create new innovations, initiatives 

and diverse minds. 

Focusing on going beyond for growth, leads to our commitment to focus on 

efficiency and better resource management. We do this by enhancing our 

workers competencies through various new trainings, beginning from our 

management level, right down to our staff and workers at our site offices. 

This strategy will help us to optimize the use of our existing resources 

which in the end will enable us to lower our operating costs and boost the 

productivity and effectiveness of our operations. 

In 2018, we continue to embrace the principles of Indonesian Sustainable 

Palm Oil (ISPO) and International Sustainability and Carbon Certification 

(ISCC) schemes. As a result, a new milestone was achieved where a third 

plantation and mill were certified by ISPO this year. We believe that ISPO 

and ISCC certifications provide competitive advantages in the market while 

simultaneously helping us to ensure our quality, responsibility and the 

sustainability of our products.

[102-14]

We have also continued to maintain and map out our HCV and HCS areas, 

improving our effective water management systems, chemical spraying 

systems and continuous engineering improvement programs to reduce 

our carbon footprint within our daily operations. In accordance, we also 

maintain our soil fertility by allowing the organic nutrients from biomass 

waste to be re-used as natural fertilizer for our trees. 

Last but not least, Kencana always respects the rights of our people and the 

local communities surrounding our operational areas. We are committed to 

help ensure the improvement of their welfare and livelihood through our 

contributions both economically and socially by hiring them as workers, 

teaching them to cultivate their own plantations along with social works 

such as the doctorShare programs and the completion of the “Jembatan 

Merdeka”, amongst others. 

Moving Forward

Although there were many achievements in 2018 regarding our production 

management, there will be new challenges ahead of us. However, we are 

confident with the initiatives we have taken this year, we are equipped 

with robust plans to ensure sustainability practices are to be implemented 

throughout our plantations and increasing the number of estates and mills 

to be certified ISPO certification. Moreover, we will always aim to keep our 

stride of zero fatality and continuous improvement in health and safety for 

our people. 

Appreciation

On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank all of our 

stakeholders and all of our staff for their hard work, continual support, 

commitment and dedication. 

We are confident of meeting future challenges and seizing opportunities 

which may come our way to take the Group to the next level of growth 

through sustainability.

2018 Sustainability Report

The Group started its operations in 1995 in Bangka 

Island with a strong belief of its positive contributions 

to the economy and the society. The nature of palm oil 

that is an eco-friendly, sustainable and most efficient 

source of vegetable oil compared to other crops, 

along with the social and economic multiplier effects 

resulted from its operation, has allowed Kencana Agri 

to pursue business growth while balancing it with 

social and environmental consciousness.

Over the years, the Group is committed to continuing 

growing 

our 

plantation 

business 

sustainably. 

Our strategy is through improving the quality 

and productivity of our plantations and continue 

strengthening 

our 

environmental, 

social 

and 

governance (ESG) values.

Hand-in-Hand with  

Our Stakeholders

In our pursuits of sustainable business practices, 

we engage our stakeholders in the implementation 

of various initiatives and programs that ensure the 

sustainability of our business, the environment, and 

society. 

Our stakeholders are entities or individuals that are 

either directly or indirectly involved in our business, 

have specific interests in our company and might be 

significantly impacted by how we operate. Our key 

stakeholders include the shareholders, customers, 

employees, non-governmental organizations, industry 

groups, and government agencies.

The Group reaches out to the stakeholders and 

conducts regular engagement activities from formal 

to informal settings to help us maintain relationship 

and, most importantly, to allow us to have a clear 

perspective on our performance in meeting their 

expectations as well as to provide valuable feedbacks.

Our engagement principles are based on Inclusivity, 

Materiality, and Responsiveness.

INCLUSIVITY 

 

We consider our stakeholders 

to be those who have 

a direct interest in our 

business and those who are 

impacted by our business 

and how we operate.

MATERIALITY 

The stakeholder engagement 

process helps us identify 

and manage current 

and emerging issues.

RESPONSIVENESS 

We continually monitor the 

changing environment in 

which we operate to ensure 

stakeholder concerns are 

captured and managed 

continuously. We recognize 

that material issues can be 

very complex with diverging 

stakeholder expectations. 

We strive to manage these 

expectations in a transparent, 

prudent and fair manner.

2018 Sustainability Report

Material Issues Analysis  

and Evaluation

Kencana conducted a materiality survey in 2018 to 

offer a more refresh and relevant representation of 

concerns and interests that are significant/important 

to the stakeholders and Kencana Agri. Compared to the 

previous year, more specific issues appear as we take a 

closer look and a targeted approach to various concerns 

captured from our stakeholder engagement activities.

The results show inconsiderable differences between 

the current and the previous year’s matrix, with 

Responsible Oil Palm Business practices, Economic 

Performance, Employment, and OSH becoming most 

material issues, followed by topics on Governance, 

Compliance, Local Community Empowerment, and 

Human Rights.

Through the survey, the Group is enabled to get a better 

understanding of specific material concerns from our 

stakeholders to address. These points of interests 



then become the groundwork for the development of 

our materiality matrix of Kencana Agri’s Sustainability 

Report 2018.

Based on this materiality analysis and evaluation, 

Kencana identified eleven most material issues for this 

year’s Sustainability Report. They are:

1. Fire Management

2. Actualization of Company’s Goals

3. Employee Welfare

4. Occupational Safety, Health and Environment

5. Product Quality

6. Employee Training &amp; Development 

7. Ethics and Integrity in Corporate Governance

8. Fulfilment of Sustainability Certification 

Requirement

9. Local Economy Empowerment and Development

10. Water and Effluent Management

11. Gender Equality and Women Participation

2018 Sustainability Report

Proper implementation of Corporate 

Governance creates a strong foundation 

for the Group’s operations and 

conduct within the corridors of 

ethical, responsible and sustainable 

business practices. To that end, 

the Group establishes structured 

framework systems and policies that 

follows the principles of accountability, 

fairness  and transparency with our 

stakeholders. The publication of 

our annual sustainability reports 

also becomes part of our governance 

practices

Governance Structure

In Kencana Agri, the Board of Directors becomes the 

highest governing body that is responsible for the 

strategic direction of the Group. At the end of 2018, the 

Board consisted of 6 (six) members with vast expertise 

and strong track records in oil palm and  several 

other industries. The ultimate role of the Board will 

be to protect and strengthen the long-term value and 

returns of the Group for its shareholders.  

To assist the Board in the execution of its duties, a 

number of Board Committees, namely the Nominating 

Committee (NC), the Remuneration Committee (RC) 

and the Audit &amp; Risk Management Committee (ARC), 

have been established, empowered with specific 

responsibilities and authorities to make decisions on 

matters within its terms of reference.

Nominating Committee (NC)

To ensure the implementation of a formal and 

transparent process for all Board appointments. It 

has adopted written terms of reference defining its 

membership, administration, and duties. The NC has 

taken a process for assessing the performance of the 

Board as a whole instead of individual assessment.

Remuneration Committee (RC)

To ensure the establishment of a formal and transparent 

procedure on the remuneration packages of individual 

directors. The RC will work within the principle that the 

remuneration should be structured to link rewards to 

corporate and individual performance.

Audit and Risk Management Committee  (ARC)

To assist the Board with discharging its responsibility 

to safeguard the Group’s assets, maintain adequate 

accounting records and develop and maintain an 

effective system of risk management and internal 

controls, including matters related to sustainability 

issues. The ARC has undertaken an annual review 

of the audit and non–audit services provided by the 

external auditors to satisfy it that the nature and extent 

of such services will not prejudice the independence 

and objectivity of the auditors before recommending 

their re-nomination to the Board.

Governing Sustainability  

[102-18][102-19][102-20][102-26][103-3]

On top of carrying out its statutory responsibilities, 

the Board considers sustainability issues, e.g., 

environmental and social factors, as part of its 

strategic formulation. On this matter, the Board 

has appointed the Executive Vice-Chairman to lead 

the implementation of sustainability initiatives and 

activities, supported by a Sustainability Team. The 

Team consists of Head of Sustainability, Manager of 

Sustainability, and coordinators both in Head Office 

and Site Office to conduct necessary engagement, 

review and reporting on related sustainability strategy 

and plans.

The Board regularly holds meetings to review the 

Group’s overall performance, to deliberate on specific 

issues including significant acquisitions and disposals, 

to approve the annual budget and to approve the 

release of the quarterly, half-yearly and year-end 

financial results. The Board meets at least four times 

a year. In addition to the scheduled meetings, ad-hoc 

board briefings, conference calls, and physical meetings 

are held as warranted by particular circumstances or as 

deemed appropriate by the Board members. A total of 

five board meetings were held in 2018.

Included in the process of Identification of Material 

Issues, the Team reports to the Board on the results 

and receives related feedbacks that will take effect on 

the formulation of the Group’s sustainability policies, 

targets, and plans. Sustainability risk management is 

built into the Group’s risk management structure and 

remains under the Board through the Audit Committee. 

The meetings are usually held three times a year, 

together with the Audit &amp; Risk Committee meeting.

Communication with 

Shareholders

Recognizing that our shareholders are one of the 

most important aspects to achieving sustainability 

within our business, the Group ensures to maintain 

regular and informative communications with the 

shareholders regarding the Group’s operations or 

any matters that require disclosures. The Group 

utilizes SGXNET to publish information on the Group’s 

dealings or any news release about the Group. 

Through this channel, price sensitive information is 

also prudently updated and released to the public to 

mitigate possible complications. Note that the Group 

does release all of its information online whether it 

be financially or operationally related. However, the 

timing of said release dates is determined to cause the 

least disruption to the Group as possible.

We publish Annual reports every April with notices of 

AGM’s being sent to all shareholders. AGMs notices 

are also published in local newspapers and made 

available on the SGXNET. At the AGMs, shareholders 

are given the opportunity to express their views and 

raise any queries regarding the Group.

All AGM results  are announced or issued within the 

assigned period and made available on the Group’s 

website. The Group strictly does not engage in 

selective disclosure. The Group also updates  its 

shareholders through its corporate website: http://

www.kencanaagri.com.

Ethics and Risk Management

The Group has zero tolerance for fraud and corruption. 

To mitigate any potential risks, the Group has enforced 

a Code of Ethics that are based on values and principles 

that serves as the fundamentals for working etiquette 

and decision making that has been adopted by the 

Board of Directors and applies to every director, officer, 

and employee in all our companies. 

Our Code comprises values which include: 

1. Compliance with any applicable laws 

     and  regulations

2. Maintain the Group's reputation and asset

3. Prevent any conflict of interests between 

     personal and corporate matters

4. Integrity in data and facts recording

5. Contribute to a harmonious work environment

6. Prevent any abuse of power related 

     to personal/family matters

7. Prohibition to engage in any immoral activities

8. Continuous learning/knowledge development

Our Code of Ethics has been distributed to all employees 

and directors. In addition, the Group provides guidance 

to the Group’s directors and employees on their 

dealings in securities and other business ventures. 

Moreover, the Group risk management committee 

conducts a meeting quarterly and identifies its key risks 

to assess the effectiveness of the risk management 

and internal control systems, especially dealing with 

financial, operational, compliance and climate change 

risks. The Board, through the Audit and Risk Management 

Committee continuously identify, review and monitor 

the key risks, control measures and management 

actions as part of the risk management process. [102-11]

The Group’s risk management framework comprises 

of assessments which separate risks into three 

categories: preventable, unpreventable and external. 

The risk management group would then utilize a risk 

matrix to determine the significant issues, which shall 

be prioritized and monitored in a more serious manner. 




33

Kencana Agri Limited



To ensure mitigation efforts are conducted accordingly 

the risks the committee place quarterly meetings where 

risks are reviewed and are subsequently reported to 

the Audit and Risk Committee board meeting. [102-11]

Also embedded within our Code of Ethics and Risk 

Management is our whistleblowing policy, which is 

closely monitored by the Internal Audit, guarantees 

confidentiality and freedom in raising concerns. The 

whistleblowing policy shall identify contact points for 

reports in fraud, corruption, and other risks. We follow 

the spirit of our policy, and it has been socialised to 

our workers. Reports may be made via phone call or 

by email to our contact centre. The Group ensures 

anonymity and protects the whistle-blowers in case of 

a report. [102-17]

External Initiatives  

&amp; Associations [102-12] [102-13]

In light of our Group's external initiatives, we 

commit and strive to adopt sustainable agricultural 

practices through certification with the ISPO and 

ISCC certifications. In addition to our Community 

Development agendas and initiatives, stakeholder 

engagement and awareness is crucial to achieving 

the required certifications and approval as well as 

satisfaction from our external stakeholders.

Another benefit of our external initiatives is the 

better communication of our sustainability standards 

throughout all our supply chains while at the same 

time firmly encouraging everyone to join in making a 

more sustainable business in general. Such initiatives 

will boost the Group’s efforts in becoming a more 

sustainable business whose operations always aim to 

benefit and satisfy all our stakeholders.

To date, the Group has participated actively as 

a member in a number of associations, namely: 

Gabungan 

Pengusaha

This Sustainability Report presents only the

discussions on these matters, please refer to 

the Group’s Annual Report 2018.

Palm oil yet holds a significant role in many of the 

world’s consumption of vegetable oil. Considerably a 

more affordable choice compared to other vegetable 

oil, vast availability in the markets, and its versatile 

applications for various consumer products, palm 

oil has become the main staple in domestic cooking 

as well as an essential ingredient in manufacturing 

processes of more than 50% of the products we use 

every day. 

In 2018, palm oil production continued to top other 

vegetable oils with around 31.1% (including palm oil 

and palm kernel oil) with a total planted area of only 

6% of the total land needed to produce vegetable oils 

globally (Oil World, 2018). The efficiency of oil palm’s 

yield still cannot be rivalled by any other vegetable oil.

Despite facing a challenging year, palm oil industries 

in Indonesia has thrived throughout 2018, recording 

the highest output in history with 47.4 million tons, 

increased by 12.9% compared to the previous year of 42 

million tons. Total export also increased by 7.8%, from 

32,2 million tons to 34.7 million tons. Consumption 

also increased by 22% from 11 million tons in 2017 to 

13.49 million tons.   

Internally, despite the challenges and market dynamics 

that the Group faced in 2018, Kencana expects that 

the demand for palm oil will continue to grow in the 

coming years. For that reason, we continue to strive 

and strengthen the Group's strategic focus and efforts 

to boost productivity, produce better quality products 

to meet market demand and at the same time ensuring 

the sustainability of our operation.

Customer and Marketplace

Kencana serves both domestic and international 

markets. We are one of the suppliers of palm oil 

products for palm oil refiners, traders, brokers, 

oleochemical companies, and fast-moving consumer 

goods companies (FMCG). In 2018, all of our sales 

continued to be dominated by domestic sales. [102-6]

As a commitment, we assure customers that they 

receive nothing but the best through maintaining 

a positive and close relationship with our valued 

customers and by conducting periodic visits. Our 

continuous communication with the customers also 

helps us to obtain feedback to improve our products 

and services further. Doing so, we believe that we will 

be enabled to create the best customer experience 

that will eventually ensure the sustainability of our 

business.

Furthermore, the Group safeguards customers' privacy 

and strive to meets all prevailing regulations regarding 

production, distribution, and traceability. To that 

end, throughout 2018, we recorded no significant 

complaints 

from 

customers 

and 

marketplace 

authorities regarding the Group's products, marketing 

communication practices or anticompetitive behaviour.

growth of our business, environment, and the socio-

economy of the local community, our employees, 

and the entire value chain of the Group. To that end, 

throughout our operations, we strive to initiate

that will ensure the implementation of various aspects 

of our sustainability commitments. 

Focus on efficiency and better resource management 

are implemented by continually optimising the use 

of our resources including land, soil, water, fertilisers, 

seeds quality, and many more. This focus and efforts

boost the productivity and effectiveness of our overall 

operations.

We also continue to improve our production processes 

through the implementation of Best Management 

Practices, 

replanting 

programs, 

efficient 

FFB 

transportation, and better tending of our crops to 

produce higher yields, as well as improving soil fertility. 

Moreover, we focus on improving our effective water 

management systems, chemical spraying system and 

continuous engineering improvement programs to 

reduce our carbon footprint within our daily operations.

Also, we maintain and sustain our soil fertility by 

allowing the organic nutrients from biomass waste to 

be re-utilised as natural fertilisers for the soil. The use 

of legume cover crops protects soil integrity, conserves 

moisture, boosts nutrients and reduces soil surface 

runoff. Furthermore, the Group maintains buffer zones 

to protect riparian areas and water quality.

Last but not least, Kencana always respects the rights 

of our people and the local communities surrounding 

our operational areas. We are committed to helping 

ensure and contribute to the betterment of their 

welfare and livelihood.

Maintaining Product Quality [416-1]

We are committed only to provide excellent product 

quality. To that end, the Group ensures that Good 

Management Practices (“GMP”) are applied and 

reflected within all of our Standard Operating 

Procedures (“SOP”). These include FIFO treatment 

for FFB, maintaining low stockpiles for CPO &amp; kernel, 

ensuring sufficient labour to support harvesting 

rotation, clean condition of collection point (TPH) 

and minimising mill breakdown amongst others, to 

maintain the quality of our FFA. 

The Group also adopts the principles from both ISPO 

and ISCC within our operations. We conduct ISPO 

surveillance audits yearly and re-certification audits as 

required at all estates and companies within our Group. 

On top of compliance, we believe that ISPO audits and 

certifications provide competitive advantages in the 

market and help us ensure the quality, responsibility 

and sustainability of our products.

In compliance with the ISCC principles, all FFB 

products coming into and from PT Sawindo Kencana 

are traceable to any of our stakeholders. Our ability to 

provide product traceability guarantees that our CPO 

and FFB were produced in and by reputable sources.

that are compulsory in running sustainable oil palm 

operations in Indonesia. International Sustainability 

&amp; Carbon Certification (ISCC) covers major and minor 

indicators to promote green practices, in particular in 

regards to product traceability and protection of land.

To achieve the required standards, Kencana commits 

to a number of actions that are rigorously monitored. 

Regular assessments are conducted to review 

our compliance with the PROPER, ISCC, and ISPO 

provisions. 

In 2018, three companies were ISPO certified while 

two companies attained ISCC certifications. Both PT 

Sawindo Kencana and PT Alamraya Kencana Mas 

have successfully maintained their ISPO and ISCC 

certifications, while PT Sawit Kaltim Lestari obtained 

new ISPO certification in 2018.  In 2018, all companies 

were successful in attaining Blue PROPER assessment 

rating.

Going forward, the Group aims to:

•	 Maintain a minimum certification of Blue PROPER 

rating across all our operations

•	 Maintain ISPO certificates at all plantations with 

mills and achieve ISPO certification for PT Agro Inti

The Group upholds a zero burning policy 

throughout its operations. In line with our 

Sustainability Policy, the Group does not 

use fire in land clearing processes; instead, 

we mechanically clear land and harness 

the organic contents of the decomposable 

biomass to replenish the soil. This biomass 

provides a rich substrate for new plantings 

and reduces the needs of chemical fertilisers 

application.

The Group also does not convert peat land 

in newly developed areas, even though the 

Indonesian government regulation allows 

the development of peatland up to a depth 

of three meters. Usually, the identification 

of peatland is determined during HCV and/

or HCS studies before new land conversion.

In maintaining the quality of our soils, 

we make some improvements through 

effective management practices through 

KENCANA AGRI’S  

ZERO BURNING POLICY &amp;  

LAND MANAGEMENT

reintroducing vital nutrients to plantation 

soil through the mulching of empty fruit 

bunches, the use of cover crops, and the 

application of nitrogen-rich palm oil mill 

effluent: a fertiliser substitute. Mulching 

suppresses weed growth, and cover crops 

conserve soil integrity and fertility, increase 

water retention, and reduce surface runoff.

Further, in areas where our trees are planted 

on sloped terrains, we build terraces and silt 

pits to minimise soil erosion and the leaching 

of fertilisers and pesticides into water 

bodies. We preserve buffer zones between 

estates and rivers to protect riverbanks and 

maintain water quality.

As part of the Group’s effort in maintaining 

soil fertility, a Leaf Sampling Unit (“LSU”) 

analysis is also conducted every year 

to ensure soil fertility and fertilisers are 

accurately used throughout the plantation.

Emission Reduction  

and Monitoring

One of our main focuses in our environmental 

management system is to reduce our GHG emissions 

throughout our operations. In 2018, we continued 

with our initiatives to improve our GHG performance, 

which include:

1. Utilizing biomass to use as fertilizer and an 

alternative fuel substitute for generators and boilers 

as to reduce emissions from the use of fertilizers 

and diesel fuel in our estate and factories.

2. Monitoring the use of generators for housing 

electricity. Housings in estates are connected to the 

government grid whenever possible, thus reducing 

emissions from diesel generators.

3. Monitoring air quality every 6 months within our 

estate and mills area. For example, reporting on NOx, 

CO and SOx values found around our plantation and 

mills. Under the Indonesian government regulations, 

BML for NOx, CO and SOx values that needs to be 

met are 400, 30,000 and 900 µg/nm3 respectively. 

The average NOx, CO and SOx values have been 

consistently maintained well under the BML. Even 

though we are under the BML limit, we strive to keep 

lowering our air emissions to the best that we can.

From these efforts, we have been able to monitor and 

calculate our GHG emissions from two most significant 

operation areas, namely PT Sawindo Kencana and PT 

Alamraya Kencana Mas covering calculation of GHG 

emission from plantation operations, mills operations 

and transportation activities from both subsidiaries 

which were generated from fuel consumption, 

application of fertilizers.

Energy Consumption

Focusing on lowering the amount of energy consumption 

is imperative for the Group, the industry, and the 

wider society to maintain its growth sustainably. 

Commitment and actions to continuously improve 

energy efficiency and reduce the usage of non-

renewable sources of energy are crucial to achieving 

this goal. To that end, the Group focuses on two 

umbrella initiatives regarding energy, which are energy 

consumption reduction and maximising the utilisation

mostly from 52 % production of its prime mature oil 

palms (nucleus and plasma), which amounted to 

992,722 tonnes of FFB in 2018. [103-2]

From this amount of FFB, our mills were able to produce 

biomass fuel such as fibres and shells amounting to 

190,276 tonnes, or 2,260,137 Gigajoules of energy, 

which is equivalent to 22,362,049kWh of electricity. In 

comparison to the total 27,781,969kWh of electricity 

generated, the biomass fuel accounts for 80% of the 

Group's total generated electricity. [103-3][302-1]

In 2018, Kencana managed to minimise the consumption 

of fuels that were previously used for transportation 

vehicles (motorcycles) in our plantation areas to a very 

minimum insignificant volume.

of alternative energy sources through the use of 

biomass as renewable energy sources. [103-1]

To lower energy consumption, The Group’s estates 

continue to optimise the quality and the quantity of the 

FFB produced, hence resulting in a higher percentage 

of utilisation in the mills.

In 2018, the average FFB yields were 16.72 tonnes 

(nucleus) and 15.98 tonnes (plasma) per hectare, while 

our Oil Extraction Rate (“OER”) was 20.10 %. These OER 

and FFB yields show that the Group’s growth potential 

is not yet fully realised as 48 % of its nucleus oil palms 

are in the immature and young mature stage. This data

Water Usage

Water is essential in the cultivation of oil palms and 

production activities. Realising its importance, the 

Group conducts control and mitigation efforts on any 

impacts on water availability and quality. We also 

implement 3R programmes, as well as the installation 

and integration of wastewater treatment systems with 

our overall waste management. These actions are 

aimed to maximise the utilisation of wastewater from 

our operations and to be able to discharge it back to 

water bodies responsibly. [103-1][103-2]

In Kencana Agri, the implementation of the Group's 

water management systems has been designed with 

careful consideration and comprehensive hydrology, 

agronomy, and topography studies, as well as 

environmental and social impacts assessments. The 

effectiveness and impacts of the water management 

system, including from its construction phase, have 

been carefully analysed and evaluated. Computer 

software modelling and simulation of the system were 

used, thus aiding the Group in designing an optimal 

system for each particular area. [103-2]

Throughout 2018, the Group withdrew a total of 

1,616,407 m3 of water which was sourced from nearby 

reservoirs and rivers in our estates for mill processing. 

Most of the reservoirs we use sourced its water from 

rainwater. [303-1]

Our water consumption intensity based on 2018 total 

water consumption was 1,65 m3 of water per ton of 

CPO produced. Total water usage by the Group consists 

of 76% from reservoirs and the remaining 24% from 

rivers surrounding our estate areas.

an ideal environment for oil palm cultivation. The 

objective of the Group's water system management is 

to prevent flooding, minimise erosion, and to secure 

the water supply for our plantation areas during the 

dry season. [103-2]

Moreover, watergate systems in low lying areas,

and level in our plantation areas. Furthermore, water 

reservoirs were constructed to ensure medium and 

long-term availability of water. Ideal land conditions 

and an effective water system management will 

enhance the effectiveness of fertilisers and natural 

organic nutrients absorbed by oil palms. [103-2]

To further improve protection on our water bodies 

around the plantation, the Group utilises modified 

portable water tanks that are used to fill knapsacks 

and mix chemicals before spraying activities take 

place. This approach ensures that no chemicals will 

contaminate any nearby streams, and prevent workers 

from collecting water with contaminated containers in 

water streams or creeks. 

Therefore, our Group's target is to reduce approximately 

10% of water consumption in our mills and plantation 

in 2019 to ensure the proper management of water 

usage. [103-2]

Throughout 2018, there were no reports or complaints 

regarding water supply or quality from any parties 

to the Group regarding significant impact to water 

sources from our operations. [303-2]

Waste Management

All plantation waste and production by-products 

are recovered and reused. Empty fruit bunches are 

mulched, naturally returning nutrients to plantation 

soil. Shells and fibre also provide renewable boiler 

feedstock. Recycling production and plantation waste 

as a fertiliser substitute reduce operational costs. 

In 2018, we recovered 204,913 tonnes of empty fruit 

bunches, which is a significant 43% increase from 

143,408 tonnes in 2017, and 619,283 m3 of effluents 

from processing activities, which is a 0.227% increase 

from the previous year of 617,878 m3. [103-1][103-3]

Efficient waste management plays an important role 

within our Group to reduce the impact of environment 

pollution. Aside from ensuring the sustainability of the 

environment, our waste management system also acts 

as a way to cut our operational costs. For example, 

by efficiently utilizing land application methods to 

supplement our palm oil trees, the Group can increase 

our overall yields while at the same time cutting costs 

by using less chemical supplements. Moreover, through 

the utilization of other biomass forms such as shells 

and fibre as a substitute for diesel, we can reduce the 

costs needed to run our boilers and generators. [103-2]

Hazardous waste produced as an outcome of our 

operations consists of used lubricants, used rags, used 

batteries, used filters, empty paint cans and printer 

cartridges, and needles from health clinics. The waste 

produced at our site office amounts to less than 50kg 

each day, all of which are segregated, labelled and 

stored in a secure, fire resistant temporary storage 

facilities. Our storage facilities are equipped with 

accidental spill containment kits, alarms, firefighting 

gears, shower/eyewash and first aid kits.

2018 Sustainability Report

The period of waste disposal relies on its type and 

category, with storage times ranging from 180-365 

days. After being stored within its stipulated time and 

in accordance with hazardous waste management 

regulations, the waste would be taken away by a third 

party. The carrier would then issue a manifest of handling 

of hazardous waste transport which Kencana will use 

as proof to report to the Ministry of Environment and 

Forestry.

However, there are also cases where the Group 

could recycle and reuse the waste output from our 

operations. In these cases, the waste would be stored 

for a total of 5 years. After that time has elapsed, the 

waste could be recycled into compost fertilizer that 

could be applied as an addition to our palm trees.

As mentioned earlier, proper hazardous waste 

management in accordance to the Indonesian 

regulation is taken very seriously at Kencana. Hence, 

our Health and Safety Officers at each site has been 

properly trained and are qualified to monitor and 

ensure that the waste management practices are in 

accordance with the rules.

On the other hand, medical waste are disposed through 

the collaboration with community health centres or 

“puskesmas” which will incinerate the waste safely. 

Facilities are inspected regularly by the Regional 

Environmental Agency, and each plantation ensures 

that facility permits are up to date. In 2018, each mill 

produced an average 3.1 tonnes of hazardous waste, 

decreased by 62.58% compared to last year. In 2018, 

there were no reports of any significant spills. [306-2]

Palm Oil Mill Effluent 

Management

Our Palm Oil Mill Effluent (“POME”) is treated in the 

Group's Waste Water Treatment Plant through Cooling 

Ponds, Mixing Ponds, Anaerobic Ponds, and Settling 

Ponds. In newer mills, the POME is treated in a multi-

feeding wastewater treatment system where only 

anaerobic bacteria is used. 

In 2018, there was a total of 619,293 m3 of wastewater 

from 5 of our mills. The effluent quality is expressed 

using a median Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) 

averaged at 692 mg/l, which is lower than the regulated 

standard of BOD level at 5,000mg/l. 

From its physical characteristic, these effluents contain 

primarily water, which is from the mill processing. 

Chemically, effluents contain elements and nutrition 

that can help support and restore soil condition. From 

studies carried out from 2014 to 2018, we learned that 

the addition of water and extra nutrients to the soil 

might boost yields of oil palm production from 6 ton/

ha to 8 ton/ha, compared with other blocks in the same 

planting year without land application of reutilised 

POME.

Based on those studies, we put into use 100% of our 

production POME as fertilisers back into the field 

on areas that have already been licensed for land 

application. It is important to note that the Group does 

not discharge any of our POME into waterbodies. The 

amount of palm oil mill effluent (POME) recycled back 

to the plantations was at a ratio of 0.62 m3 of effluent 

per 1 metric tonne of FFB processed. [306-1]

Illustrated below is our Biological Oxygen Demand 

(“BOD”) level across our mills of the wastewater 

treatment outlets, with the water later used for land 

application. The Group ensures that the BOD level of 

effluents to be applied for land application is safely 

below the standard. [306-1]

Even though BOD levels across all mills are already 

below allowed regulated standards, we continue to 

safeguard the quality of groundwater and prevent any 

risk of contamination by installing monitoring wells. 

These wells are covered, locked and maintained regularly. 

Representatives from the Regional Environmental 

Agency inspect the quality of the water within the wells

Integrated Pest Management

Crop and pasture health is a crucial factor to reach 

optimum levels of productivity and economic 

profitability in the palm oil industry and the agricultural 

and livestock sectors in general. Pest incidence directly 

affects the yields and quality that are necessary for the 

sale and trade of agricultural goods and stable food 

supply.

The use of agrochemicals such as pesticides, fungicides 

and herbicides to control pests by is one of the most 

used methods in the industry. However, many of these 

chemicals have severe negative impacts on human 

and environmental health because of their high 

toxicity and incorrect application. To that end, as part 

of our commitment to more sustainable operations, 

Kencana strives to reduce the excessive use of these 

agrochemicals, primarily to mitigate any damage to 

the environment and the soil condition. [103-1]

To that end, non-chemical pest control measures 

are preferred at all Kencana’s palm oil plantations, 

in particular through Integrated Pest Management 

System designed to minimise the use of chemicals by 

relying on natural and cultural alternatives. Integrated 

pest management is the practice that we implement 

by using a range of strategies to sustainably maintain 

pest populations within economic thresholds while 

causing minimal harm to local ecosystems. In this 

system, encouraging natural predators have enabled 

a reduction in the utilisation of pesticide; and over 

the last three years, we managed to reduce our use of 

chemical pesticides. [103-2][103-3]

Several pests found in the perimeter of Kencana Agri’s 

plantations and mills are including rats, rhinoceros 

beetles, 

bunch 

moths, 

bagworms, 

and 

nettle 

caterpillars. In order to organically and sustainably 

limit the presence of the pests, we breed owls to 

control rat populations and encourage the predators 

of bagworms and caterpillars to flourish by planting 

Turnera subulata, Turnera ulmifolia, Antigononleptopus, 

Cassia tora, and Nephrolepis. Moreover, to control 

metisanaplana, a pesky caterpillar native to West and 

Central Sulawesi region, the Group cultivates Turnera 

Subulata, Turneraulmifolia, Cassia tora, Euphorbia 

heterophylla, and Antigonon leptopus which are 

planted at each block alongside palm oil crops. These 

plants contain nectar and pollen that serve as a food 

source for parasitoid insects and predators of the 

pest caterpillars, ultimately bringing pest populations 

under control.

Kencana Agri Limited



MEET OUR 

NATURE SQUAD

 OWL

Owls help us to control pests population. We placed 

nest boxes around the perimeter of our plantations to 

invite barn owls to nest. 

By the end of 2018, PT Sawindo Kencana had been the 

home for a total 92 adult owls (Tyto alba), 20 juveniles 

as well as 79 unhatched eggs. Meanwhile, in PT 

Alamraya Kencana Mas, there had been 29 adult owls, 

and 15 juveniles nesting throughout plantation areas.

It has been estimated that one owl can cover a range 

of 30Ha. With a total of 101 adults, the owls are able 

to safeguard up to 3,030Ha. Since there are juveniles 

that are yet to become adults, the area coverage will 

continue to increase in 2019.

 TURNERA SUBULATA

Turnera Subulata is a flower originally from Mexico 

and the West Indies. Aside from helping make the 

plantations look more colourful and easy on the eyes, 

the flower is the perfect home for Sycanus, a type of 

insect that hunts caterpillars and worms that can 

damage oil palms. This beautiful flower has been 

helping us to suppress and minimise pest attack

 TURNERA ULMIFOLIA

Adding to the flower power that helps us to control 

pest in our plantations, Turnera Ulmifolia is a flower 

in the same family with Turnera Subulata. This flower 

that always blooms every 8 AM in the morning, which 

is also a medicinal plant, acts as hosts for attracting 

insects that help control the population of damaging 

pests in our plantations.

 ANTIGONON LEPTOPUS

An important team in our nature squad, Antigonon 

Leptopus is flowering shrubs which host a range of 

predators of leaf-eating pests. This powerful beauty 

help Kencana in our pest control approaches.

Kencana turn to nature to help us 

manage pests and ensure the health of 

our palm oil crops, yields and balance 

of natural ecosystem. Allow us to 

introduce you to the nature squadfrom 

various regions of our operations.

Nature Conservation [304-1] [304-3]

Part of our sustainability commitment is to employ 

best management practices that are environmentally 

friendly. To that end, the Group has been protecting 

the natural environment around the perimeter of 

its plantations and mills since the beginning of its 

operations and always ensures that our operations 

can be conducted in respect towards the surrounding 

environment, especially in regards with the protection 

of the biodiversity.

In compliance with ISPO and ISCC standards, the 

Group conducts effective conservation efforts under 

a number of approaches. These include continual 

improvement of our High Conservation Value (HCV) 

area monitoring efforts, internal capacity building, 

engagement with local communities and other oil 

palm plantation companies, as well as partnerships 

with academic and research institutions, NGOs and 

governmental organizations. [103-1] [304-3]

We are committed to preserve all conservation areas, 

maintaining habitats and not convert HCV land into 

plantation. Our commitment is evident in the increase 

of HCV land area locations within the Group. By the end 

of 2018, the Group has identified 18,081 ha of HCV area. 

Apart from our conservation studies the Group has also 

conducted HCS studies. Keeping in mind that Kencana 

will continue ensuring that the HCV areas are and will 

remain protected. [103-2][103-3]

In managing HCV areas, the Group has ensured to 

conduct HCV studies for all new development areas, 

through accredited independent HCV assessors, and 

implements a management strategy that focuses on 

these following key aspects:

•	 Preservation of river border lines.

•	 Cultivation local trees in HCV area.

•	 Educating the local community on the importance 

of preserving HCV areas.

•	 Regularly monitoring river water quality.

•	 HCV areas are regularly monitored and audited by 

the internal sustainability team.

•	 Recording every wildlife species found in the estates, 

and taking notes of those classified as vulnerable

EMPOWERING THE  

LOCAL COMMUNITIES

One of Kencana’s main community 

development goals is to support the 

growth of independent and robust 

socio-economic communities, especially 

those surrounding our operational sites. 

To that end, the Group establishes 

plans and programs that can support 

the development of their capacities 

and the growth of the local economy.

These plans and programs includes 

the plasma partnership that the Group 

initiated in 1997, where it consistently 

supports the smallholders to grow 

sustainably through the establishment 

of inclusive agribusinesses 

where Kencana operates. 

RESPECTING THE RIGHTS 

OF INDIGENOUS AND  

LOCAL PEOPLE

The Group operates on lands that 

have specific rights and traditions 

attached to them. For this reason, 

Kencana ensures to balance the 

pursuit for growth with efforts 

that protect legal, communal or 

customary rights of the indigenous 

and local people in the area. 

The Group also implements 

agricultural and business practices 

that respect the conservation of the 

biodiversity and the rights of the 

people to live and have a better life. 

FOSTERING ENGAGEMENT  

&amp; RELATIONS

Kencana establishes engagement 

and maintains relations with 

all stakeholders, including the 

communities where we operate. 

In our engagement, we strive to 

understand their way of life as well 

as recognise various needs revealed 

through direct interactions. We also 

seek to receive feedback that will 

help to improve our community 

development programs in the future. 

Concerning any complaint 

and conflict that arise from 

the communities, the Group 

applies an open, transparent 

and consultative process.

SUPPORTING  

BETTER WELFARE

Kencana Agri has always 

pursued the betterment of the 

welfare and condition of the 

surrounding communities.  To 

that end, Kencana continues 

improving the quality of life of 

the local community through 

programs, plans, infrastructure 

and acts of donation that can 

transform the socioeconomic 

conditions of the local 

communities.

Many of our Group’s operations are located in areas where 

people may sometimes live deeply remote and without 

access to the surrounding villages or cities. These groups 

of people are generally at a disadvantage having to live 

without access to the outside world or not being presented 

any opportunities to develop themselves. 

The High Conservation Value assessment carried out by 

Kencana has also included social impact assessment 

that includes culture heritage, social values, and 

gender issues. For that reason, in our interactions with 

the communities and through various engagement, the 

Group tries to recognise aspects that become primary 

sources of concerns as well as the expectation from the 

communities, which will enable them to maintain or 

improve their living condition. [413-1]

“This bridge helps free us from remoteness and  

enables our people to transport the crops. Our children 

no longer have to cross the river and be drenched when 

going to school; this can determine the future of our 

children’s education. Thank you to Kencana Agri and 

everyone who has taken part in the program." 

– Pesawat, Chief of Kahumamaon tribe


can pose itself as a challenge as the current can be 

dangerous, and passing through a river would mean 

that their clothes would always get soaked going from 

and to school.

The bridge that is of 150 meters in length is located at 

the Maleo Jaya village, South Batui sub-district, Luwuk 

Banggai regency, and has now opened up the access as 

it allows people to travel from the Tombiyobong village 

where they live to the neighbouring villages. 

In the bridge opening ceremony, which was held 

during the commemoration of the Independence Day 

of Indonesia in August 2018, the chief of Kahumamaon 

tribe, Pesawat, expressed his gratitude to related 

parties as the construction of the bridge has brought a 

special gift for the tribe. They are no longer isolated, and 

their children no longer have to go to and from school 

Concerning this, in 2018 the Group initiated a bridge 

construction project that would help the local people 

to have access to the outside world. Named Jembatan 

Merdeka (Freedom Bridge), Kencana Agri constructed 

this infrastructure through its subsidiaries PT Sawindo 

Cemerlang and PT Delta Subur Permai in cooperation 

with Vertical Rescue Indonesia (VRI), a rock climbing 

community that has been involved in building suspension 

bridges in many remote areas in Indonesia, and the Military 

District Commande 1308, as well as the local people and 

mountain climbing enthusiasts from Luwuk Banggai.

The remote indigenous community of Kahumamaon 

tribe had in particular been living with poor, if non-

existent, access to other villages. Students from this 

remote area had to pass through the Ombolu river 

every day to get to their school. Crossing Ombolu river

in wet condition. Moreover, the bridge represents the 

hope of the tribe to sustain the future, help to ensure 

the education of their children and support the people 

to transport their crops.

In addition to bridge construction, in that occasion, 

Kencana Agri ensured to help the people in other 

aspects, including the distribution of school supplies 

to the students of Tombiyobong village, as well as 

donating educational games, decent clothing, and 

hundreds of productive plant seeds to the community.

Through these community programs, Kencana wishes 

that underdeveloped communities can have better 

access to conducting their daily activities, such as 

buying basic food necessities, going to school or 

socialising with other communities.

FLOATING HOSPITAL 

[203-1] [413-1]

doctorSHARE or Yayasan Dokter Peduli is a medical aid 

program initiated by dr. Lie Dharmawan that primarily 

operates a ship to provide free medical services 

throughout Indonesia. They seek to help unprivileged 

people who live in areas that are very remote and 

typically inaccessible by existing medical assistance. There 

are four major programs that they offer, including major 

surgery (surgical procedure with full anaesthesia), minor 

surgery (surgical procedure with local anaesthesia), 

general consultation (including medical distribution 

but non-invasive) and health education.

Since 2014, Kencana has been very active working 

together with doctorSHARE. The Group sees that the 

humanitarian aid brought through doctorSHARE is very 

honourable. In 2017, dr. Lie was invited by Kencana 

Agri to speak on his vision and mission in providing 

free medical services to the communities at remote 

villages throughout Indonesia. He further reminded 

us also that the passion for serving the nation should 

never cease.  

In 2018, Kencana Agri continued its partnership with 

doctorSHARE to offer medical assistance through the 

floating hospital to the communities at Batui, Central 

Sulawesi. A total of 323 patients received free general 

medical consultation, while 23 patients were given 

major surgery assistance and 53 patients received free 

minor surgeries.

The local people were very grateful for the assistance. 

Medical treatments have always become a challenge 

for the communities. Even though they receive BPJS 

coverage (the government’s healthcare), other costs 

such as the trips to and from the hospitals can still be 

challenging.

Through these services, Kencana expects to bring real 

solutions to the community needs for affordable and 

available health services.

PLASMA PARTNERSHIP 

[203-1] [203-2] [413-1]

Our plasma partnership programs have presented 

numerous positive social-economic impacts for 

the farmers. Among others, the plasma partnership 

program in PT Sawindo Kencana enables numerous 

individuals living below the poverty line to now live a 

simple yet enjoyable life where they could afford basic 

life necessities and some luxuries like a car, and many 

more. A small village located near our plantation called 

Tempilang also became a part of the gradual positive 

changes brought by the program. The previously small, 

and almost unknown coastal village, is now buzzing 

with activities as monetary circulation has increased in 

the last two decades, coupled with the cultural event, 

Ruahan, which Tempilang hosts once a year.

To date, our plasma planted area in Bangka is over 70% 

of the total nucleus planted area, which is more than the 

20% minimum required by the government. The Group 

is supported by various stakeholders to conduct our 

plasma program, namely government, cooperatives, 

banks, and business partners. Moreover, the Group 

provides technical training, quality seeds, advice on 

manuring application, and even new technologies and 

methodologies in oil palm cultivation.

Kencana’s plasma partnership can be divided into 

three main programs, which are:

•	 KKPA (Kredit Koperasi Primer untuk Anggota or 

Credit for Members of Primary Cooperative)

The KKPA program helps to provide funds for 

communities’ 

plantation 

development. 

We 

collaborate with banks and cooperatives. The Group 

acts as the Guarantor in this program. On top of that, 

we provide training and mentoring sessions for local 

farmer cooperatives and its members about good 

agricultural practices, administration, cooperative 

management, basic financial management, and 

more.

•	 KKSR (Kebun Kelapa Sawit Rakyat or 

Community’s Oil Palm Plantation)

The KKSR program is a joint collaboration program 

with the local government aiming to empower 

local communities and help them to improve their 

welfare through the utilisation of uncultivated 

lands in the region which are owned by the 

government as palm oil plantation. The Group 

takes an active role together with the government 

in this program by offering a purchase guarantee 

of the KKSR plantation output as our raw material.

•	 Revitbun (Revitalisasi Perkebunan  

or Plantation Revitalization)

Revitbun is a national program initiated by the 

Indonesian government to help accelerate the 

growth of local plantations through expansion, 

revitalisation, rehabilitation of various commodity 

crops, including palm oil and corn. In this program, 

the Group works together with the government 

and provide our expertise to help develop 

plantation areas, cultivation, agronomy practices 

and technology, production process and product 

marketing for the local farmers/communities, 

while the government provides investment loan.

“The development of the nucleus plantation in Tempilang has brought a new hope for the 

local people to work in the plantation. The people were introduced to a mentoring program 

that later transformed into KKPA. This has changed the lives of the isolated people and 

improved their economic welfare. They have now learned modern planting and farming 

with the assistance of the company, PT Sawindo Kencana.” – sastra Dinata, soCial aCtivist 




In 2018, for the 2nd time, Kencana Agri 

received Padmamitra Awards from 

the government, on the category of 

remoteness. This award recognised 

the Group’s programs and initiatives 

that were held to improve the 

condition of people who live in remote 

areas. Kencana Agri notably conducted 

numerous programs for the local 

communities in Batui and South Batui 

subdistricts of the Luwuk Banggai 

regency throughout 2018, including 

free medical services, construction of 

suspension bridge, donation of seeds 

of productive plants, school supplies 

and others.

As an active member of the Corporate Social 

Responsibility (CSR) Forum of the Ministry of Social 

Affairs of Republic of Indonesia, Kencana Agri Group 

always commit to helping to improve the welfare 

of the people and help elevate their quality of lives 

in remote villages especially in regions where the 

Group operates. In doing so, the Group is referring to 

the Regulation of the Ministry of Social Affairs of the 

Republic of Indonesia No 6 of 2016 and with the Laws of 

the Republic of Indonesia Number 40 of 2007 regarding 

Limited Liability Companies. 

The Group aspires to be able to take part in pushing 

this country and its people forward. We aspire to see 

children in remote areas of this country can have the 

same advantages and access to quality education as 

other children living closer to cities. We aspire to be 

able to walk hand-in-hand as One Indonesia; a spirit 

that is also shared with the Kahumamaon tribe as we 

saluted the flag together during the ceremony of the 

commemoration of Independence Day in August 2018.

Further, the Group hopes that the award could 

encourage more involvement from all oil palm business 

planters in the country to achieve Program Indonesia 

Sejahtera by 2025.



The partnership and collaboration 

between the government and the 

private sectors in ensuring the 

achievement of various aspects 

of national development have 

received support and appreciation. 

This includes the Padmammitra Awards 

that the government through the Social Ministry and in 

cooperation with the Corporate Social Responsibility 

(CSR) Forum holds every two years. Started in 2014, 

Padmamitra Awards recognises and gives appreciation 

to private companies who have been committed to 

implementing social and environmental programs.

Under Padmamitra Awards seven social categories 

will be assessed by the jury, including poverty, 

abandonment, disability, remoteness/border, social 

blindness and deviation, victims of disaster or abuse, 

exploitation and discrimination, under the rankings of 

Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum rankings.

In 2018, Kencana Agri continued 

with the implementation of a 

program called BUSI (Budaya 

Eksekusi or Culture of Execution) 

at all levels starting from high 

management up to plantation 

workers. This program aims to 

start a new culture where workers 

are able to execute their work 

plan accordingly. It is a 'top-

down' change management 

program that began in the top 

management level in Jakarta, 

then rolled out to middle 

management in both HO and SO, 

and finally to all workers at SO. HR 

will review the progress of each 

department’s execution to achieve 

the set-out goal. 



BUSI focuses on several important 

aspects, i.e.:

1.  Highly Important Goals 

     (Sasaran Maha Penting or SMP)

2.  Pareto action 

     (Tindakan Pareto or TIPAR)

3.  Development board 

     (Papan Perkembangan or PAKEM)

4.  Be willing and capable 

     (Mau dan Mau or MAMA)

5.  Pledge and Promise 

 (Ikrar dan Janji or IJAN)

In its implementation, each 

employee is required to know what 

are his/her most important goals for 

the year in which are the derivates of

the Corporate most important goal. 

Every week, every employee must 

present to their superior, what are 

were their targets from last week, 

what were their achievements, and 

what are their targets for the week 

after. This exercise will subsequently 

stimulate every employees sense 

of urgency, how they will execute 

their programs accordingly, and 

more importantly to build better 

relationship within and between 

departments.  

Related to its implementation, the 

Group also holds BUSI training that 

aims to directly improve employee 

competency and indirectly on 

product quality. In 2018, a total 226 

staff participated in BUSI training.

We believe that our employees are our most significant 

assets, and they play a significant role in our Group 

development. Therefore, the Group ensures the best 

management of its people by ensuring employee 

welfare and empowerment. We provide various 

facilities, including attractive remuneration, bonuses, 

retirement benefits, and many more, as well as multiple 

opportunities for career development. The Group also 

ensures to offer facilities and services with coverages 

that extend to their families, in our commitment to 

provide our employees with the best of our abilities. 

[103-1][103-2]

Remuneration

An essential part to ensuring employees’ welfare, 

Kencana Agri offers attractive work compensation to 

its employees with an amount that will depend on 

the type and level of work and performance as well 

as in consideration of the applicable minimum wage 

and the Company’s condition. Our non-permanent 

employees receive at least the minimum wage (UMR) 

that is in accordance to the regulation from each 

region, since the minimum wage in Indonesia differ 

from one province to another, whereas our permanent 

employee receives an average of 1.76 times above the 

UMR across our area of operations. [202-1]



Here at Kencana, we highlight the importance of 

fairness and equality throughout our organization 

and give fair opportunities based on thecompetence 

of all our employees, regardless of their race, religion, 

or gender. To that end, we give equal chances with 

equal wages strictly based on the UMR and personal 

competency and achievement.

In addition to providing our employees with fair 

remuneration, we also offer benefits. The benefits for 

all of our employees are explained in the table below.

KENCANA AGRI’S  

INDUCTION TRAINING

Induction training is mandatory for new hires, especially 

for those in SO. In 2018, Kencana commissioned a 

new mill in Central Sulawesi. Together with Citra 

Widya Edukasi and Military District Command of 

Luwuk Banggai, the training was conducted for 35 

new hires and was aimed to cover aspects of mill 

processing units, internalizing corporate culture in 

their daily work, mental development, and discipline. 

Once the training had been finalized, HR conducted a 

review on the progress of each new hires to see how 

effective the training had been. Kencana considers this 

very important because the formation of character 

at the very beginning determines the success and 

cohesiveness of the mill.  

Consistently improving the quality of its human 

resources, the Group conducted another Foreman 

training in 2018. Participated by 369 foremen 

throughout the estates and mills, the training aimed to 

increase their competencies, leadership and sense of 

belonging to the family of Kencana Agri. 

The training included the vision and mission of 

Kencana Agri, the company’s working culture, new SOP 

workshop, and leadership training. The participants 

gave many positive comments, as in the past foreman 

very seldom participate in management training such 

as this one. Many felt an increased spirit of delivering 

the best quality in their work, after participating in 

the training. This program will continue for the years 

to come, to ensure regeneration of new leaders begins 

internally.

In 2018, Kencana started a new program namely the 

embedding of gold pins (Kencana logo) to employees 

who have worked for 15 consecutive years. Through 

this program, the Group appreciates its employees 

who have worked hard to help build Kencana Agri. This 

program is also intended to motivate employees to be 

able to perform better again.

“Once I’ve completed my training, my insight grew, 

and I was proud that PT. AIK held such a special 

training activity. I feel helped in terms of work because 

of the direction and guidance on how supervision 

works. Our sense of responsibility towards work have 

increased and we feel embraced by management.”

Welfare for Employees’ Families

Kencana ensures to provide facilities and services 

that can bring more comfort to its employees in doing 

their jobs and improve their ability to give their best. 

One aspect that has been recognized by the Group is 

ensuring the best care and education for the children 

of employees.

Each estate throughout Kencana Agri’s operations 

has provided a transportation unit, such as a bus, to 

transfer employees’ children to the nearest schools. 

PT SKL, in Kutai, Kalimantan Timur, has, in particular, 

started a project that is building a primary school 

building in 2018, which is planned for completion at 

the beginning of 2019. We hope that this project will 

further help to ensure that employees’ children receive 

proper education.

Human Rights

Basic human rights call for everyone to be treated 

fairly and with dignity. In Kencana Agri, employees 

have the freedom to join an association and to bargain 

collectively. We respect the right of all our employees 

to join and form associations of their choice and to 

collective bargaining. Each subsidiary and its labor 

union representatives have agreed upon a Collective 

Labor Agreement that aims to protect employees’ and 

employers’ rights and obligations. 

All our employees are protected by the Collective 

Labor Agreement, which covers industrial relations, 

working hours, remuneration, out-of-post assignments 

and transfers, social security and welfare, occupational 

health and safety, and employment termination. The 

rights of our employees have been socialized and are 

written within the Group’s regulations. Further, in order 

to continuously have good working conditions for all 

staff and employees, Kencana enables employees to 

express their complaints by filing a Letter of Grievance. 

Filing this letter ensures that their supervisors are 

aware of their concerns. Once a letter is filed, the 

employees’ superior would get in touch with them at 

a private meeting to further discuss their complaint 

and provide solutions that is agreeable to both parties. 

[102-41]

Measures taken to support these rights, among others, 

where by the employee can use grievance form to 

convey their aspirations to their superior. The superior 

then will directly address the employee's aspiration. 

Freedom of association is very important to ensure 

our employees can state and express their grievances 

transparently and solve the problem with the Group in 

an appropriate way. 



Moreover, each estate has prepared a daycare centre 

for the children of workers. The daycare will ensure 

each child shall not go to the estate with the parents 

and instead will have their activities until their parents 

finish work. Some daycares are built in such a way that 

each day there is a program for the children for their 

character building. For example, in Bangka, the Group 

collaborates with local religious leaders and mosques 

so that in addition to hold children activities, religious 

and moral teachings can also be provided to the 

children every day.

Diversity and Inclusion  

[103-1][103-2] [103-3][405-1]

A diverse and inclusive workforce with strong team 

work makes us a more competitive player within 

the palm oil business. We believe in equal treatment 

amongst genders, nationalities and age groups within 

the workplace. This is achieved by ensuring that 

equal opportunities exist for all and do not tolerate 

discrimination on any grounds.

The Group also prioritizes local recruitment. The 

highest representation of non-local workers can be 

seen in the Kalimantan estates. In Kalimantan, the 

competition within the oil palm industry increases 

every year. As we know the oil palm industry is very 

labor incentive, while there are workers within the 

local area who are willing to work, the number is not 

sufficient to cater all companies throughout the region. 

Thus, to fulfill the number of workers needed, non-

locals must be recruited.

This commitment is also reflected in the composition 

of our Board of Directors as described below.

Hiring and enabling women, in various positions 

throughout Kencana Agri is essential to providing 

diverse values to our workforce and customers. In 

order to increase female representation through 

all operational levels, the Group provides training

Women Representation in Kencana Agri’s Operations



At Kencana we promote equal opprtunities for 

both males and females, and have zero tolerance 

for sexual harassment. In 2018, Kencana had 

five operational mills, and one mill under 

commissioning phase in Sulawesi. Of these six 

mills, five of our Laboratory Assistants (Head 

Lab) were women. As a lab is often analogous to 

the 'eyes and ears' of the processing plant, Lab 

Assistants have a very crucial role in oil processing. 

Being females don't stop these five women to 

become leaders and an example for others. 

Having such a key role, Laboratory Assistants 

meet at least once a year, not only to review 

their work but also to inspire others, especially 

women in Kencana.

sessions  to ensure the candidates  are fully quipped to 

take on greater responsibility. We provide support  that 

promotes women’s career development in every region 

where the Group operates. Activities are organized that 

are geared toward female employees, including skill-

development training courses ranging from technical 

skills, leadership, to management skills.

Against Child Labour

The Group has a strict policy to uphold the ban on child 

labour and do not employ anyone under the age of 

18 years old. We seek to prevent any mistreatment of 

children as is written within our Sustainability Policy. 

As a form of our effort in ensuring the implementation 

of the policy by ensuring all workers recruited by 

Kencana Agri must show their Identity Card in the 

initial process of recruitment. Moreover, through the 

daycare facilities that are available at its operational 

sites, the Group ensures to prevent a practice where 

parents bring their children to the workplace. [103-1]

[103-2][103-3][408-1]

health throughout its working environment. This 

commitment is enforced through a number of policies 

and procedures. In addition, all health and safety 

topics that are related and relevant to the Company's 

operation and work activities are covered in a formal 

agreement with labor unions. [403-4]

To prevent work accidents, we implement procedures 

and prepare facilities that can ensure safety. We 

also regularly conduct trainings such as first aid and 

emergency responses regularly across all estates 

and mills in making certain that all workers are fully 

aware of their safety roles and responsibilities or any 

risks associated with their jobs. Standard Operating 

Procedures for Occupational Health &amp; Safety Concerns

healthy and safe working conditions. In relation to this, 

we also continue to improve the quality of our facilities 

across the regions if necessary and increase employee 

ownership in OHS related matters every year. [103-3]

In 2018, the Group had been able to maintain its 

record of Zero Fatality both in its plantations and mills 

operations. Severity rate in one of our estates managed 

by PT Sawindo Kencana had lowered from 111.33 per 1 

million working hours in 2017 to 109.76 per 1 million 

working hours in 2018. 

Further, to ensure that all OHS implementation can be 

carried out successfully and controlled soundly, OHS 

officers have been appointed. In 2018, we had a total 

of eight OSH officers, and all of them are OHS certified. 

One of the responsibilities of OHS Officers is to monitor 

all work accidents and compile them monthly. All 

Health and Safety work program reports from each site 

will then be sent to the Sustainability Department to be 

verified and evaluated.

RELEVANT TRAININGS  

FOR BETTER OHS 

PERFORMANCE

To improve their performance, our OHS 

officers often receive refreshment 

training sessions. In 2018, the Group 

collaborated with dr. Ratnosoppi 

(Hiperkes No. 16.550/DH-IV/06) 

in providing accident assistance 

training session on work accidents 

that are associated with the 

works in the oil palm industry.

From this training, our OHS officers 

became more knowledgeable 

on procedures to handle work 

accidents, for example, small cases 

of penetrating injuries from palm 

fronds up to disorders of consciousness 

and related first aid procedures.

Our People




In ensuring the 

health condition 

of our workers 

and their family, 

all estates of Kencana Agri are either equipped with 

a health facility on site in the form of a clinic or has a 

collaboration with a Puskesmas (community health 

centre) in the nearest village. Each estate with a clinic 

is also equipped with an ambulance. 

Estates that have clinics on site also cooperates with 

the nearest Puskesmas in case some referrals and 

treatments cannot be treated at the clinics. Each 

clinic is led by a paramedic and is assisted by several 

nurses that are HIPERKES (Company Hygiene and 

Occupational Health) certified. A doctor from the 

nearest Puskesmas conducts a regular visit. Thus 

patients treated at the clinic get the proper care.

Medical check-ups are also carried out at least once 

a year and are preferred for factory employees who 

work in areas with high noise, and even for employees 

who are often exposed to chemicals, such as spray 

employees. Depending on the area, a health check 

is carried out together with the local Puskesmas/

RSUD, or the local Province Health and Safety Center. 

Health checks generally examine audio-spirometry, 

lung, vision and cholinesterase. Women who work 

with chemicals also receive pregnancy tests yearly, 

to ensure that no pregnant women are working while 

being exposed to chemicals. In total, 757 workers in 

2018 received medical check-ups.

Fire Management

As a palm oil producer, the Group has established its 

commitment to apply a zero burning policy throughout 

its operations. The Group is also active to prevent the 

occurrence of fire by conducting regular emergency 

response and firefighting simulations in cooperation with 

the local Fire Department. In 2018, a total of 115 personnel 

at Kencana Agri received fire management trainings.

The Group also conducted dissemination of information 

on Karhutla (forest and land fire) in Muara Kaman 

subdistrict, Kutai, in collaboration with the Resort 

Police, Sectoral Police, and the Agriculture and Forestry 

Service, in effort to prevent the village communities 

around Muara Kaman from burning grass in effort to 

find fish. For that reason, the Group also worked together 

with the regional government to help the locals conduct 

their fishing practices in a more sustainable way, for 

examples by educating them to make fish cages.

Well-Equipped For A Sound Fire Management

Our commitment towards fire management and zero 

burning throughout the Group’s operations are also 

represented in the various training and collaboration 

we established with multiple institutions. 

In various areas of the Group’s operations, our 

plantations are designed to help us manage the risk of 

fire better and faster. Canals were constructed between 

our plantations with areas with high fire risks. Small 

fireboats and patrol cars which are equipped with 

water pumps are always in standby in the perimeter of 

those canals

In Kalimantan, we collaborated with the Manggala Agni 

team, a special unit under the Ministry of Environment 

and Forestry specially appointed to control forest fires, 

in firefighting simulations training. The training that 

our team received from Manggala Agni was specifically 

aimed to monitor, manage, and ultimately eliminate 

forest fires, as well as how to conduct emergency 

procedures such as evacuations during such events. 

Technology to Help Monitor Hotspots

In 2018, Kencana had taken one step forward in the 

utilization of technology to help the Group have better 

performance in its fire management. Particularly, 

the Group has started the use of a satellite mapping 

program that has the capability to track hotspots 

throughout the country. 

This program is installed in HO and also in SO in order 

that both estates and the Jakarta office can conduct 

joint monitoring of hotspots located throughout the 

perimeter of Kencana Agri estates.
