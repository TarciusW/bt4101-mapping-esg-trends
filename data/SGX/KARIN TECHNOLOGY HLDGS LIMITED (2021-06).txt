Board Statement  

[GRI 102-14] 

Dear Stakeholders, 

The Board of Directors is pleased to present Karin Technology Holdings Limited’s fourth full 

Sustainability Report of Financial Year 2021 (FY 2021). 

We recognise that sustainability is increasingly important for business as the world today faces 

challenging issues, including but not limited to climate change, shortage of natural resources 

and human rights. Expectations for companies to take the initiative on sustainability are higher.  

We are committed to embedding human rights considerations into decision-making across the 

Group and into our policy and governance framework.  As a listed company, we recognize the 

responsibility and opportunity we have to raise awareness among our employees on 

environmental and human rights issues. In 2020, we enhanced our training on occupational 

health and safety and prohibition of forced labor for employees in our logistics network. 

We focus on economic, environmental and social areas to underpin our sustainability strategy. 

We are committed to managing the relevant sustainability risks and opportunities across the 

portfolio to ensure the long-term well-being of our business while contributing positively to the 

environment and community. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the once-in-a-century 

transformation in the world. We shouldered a high sense of responsibility and mission. Our 

objectives have gone beyond the simple growth and expansion of our Group. We embody a sense 

of social value and responsibility.   

In addition to fulfilling our responsibilities to the sustainable development of the economy, 

environment, and the society, Karin is also an active contributor to charity.    

As we continue our sustainability journey, metrics and targets that are material to our business 

will be progressively added, providing even more insights in our future reports. We will continue 

to strengthen our engagement with key stakeholders and improve our sustainability efforts and 

practices, with the goal of forging a long-term sustainable business.

About Karin  

[GRI 102-1, 102-2, 102-3, 102-4, 102-6] 

Introduction 

Listed on the Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) since 

March 2005, Karin is a prominent IT &amp; Components Solutions and Services Group with a significant 

market presence spanning more than 40 years in Hong Kong and the People’s Republic of China 

(“PRC”).  

From the time when it was established in 1977, our primary business focus has been on electronic 

components and computer distribution for various electronics industry segments including 

communications, computer, electrical appliances and utility. During the 1990s, our business 

expanded to include outsourcing services, IC application design solutions and data storage 

management solutions. 

Since our listing on the SGX-ST Mainboard in 2005, we have carved out an escalating presence in 

three core businesses – Components Distribution; IT Infrastructure Solutions and Services; and 

Consumer Electronics Products – in Hong Kong and the PRC markets. 

In 2007, I M I Kabel Pte Ltd, a Singapore-based distributor of data control cables and 

manufacturer of power panel for a variety of industries ranging from industrial automation to 

building, port and shipyard, offshore oil fields and petrochemical facilities, was acquired by our 

Group. In 2019, it has extended to switchboard panel production and installation business. Its 

company name has been changed to I M I Kabel &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd in 2020. 

In 2011, Karin added a retail business arm to its operations under the trade name “In-Smart” 

which was subsequently disposed of on 30 June 2016 and re-invested on 1 April 2018.

Our Supply Chain 

[GRI 102-9, 102-10] 

Karin supplies a variety of electronic and computer products. These products are mainly sourced 

from traders and multinational corporation (MNC) manufacturers located in various locations. 

We have a Procurement Policy and ISO standard in place which provides procurement guidelines, 

for instance, the selection and evaluation of suppliers. Our suppliers are selected based on, 

amongst others, such as past track record, experience, capability and quality. To mitigate the 

supplier risks, we strive to diversify our supplier bases and strengthen our controls in the 

assessment of new suppliers. We annually assess and review the performance of the suppliers to 

maintain a consistently high quality of the suppliers. 

In FY 2021, there were a total of 81 suppliers (FY 2020: 64). The suppliers by geographical 

location and category are illustrated in the following charts. In FY 2021, we engaged a higher 

variety of suppliers either in locations and categories and we engaged more suppliers in our

Stakeholder Engagement

Materiality Assessment 

[GRI 102-46, 102-47, 103-1] 

Karin’s core approach to sustainability and business strategies is to identify, prioritise and 

manage the material aspects of our business that impact the environment, society and economy 

most. Our Board members and senior management team prioritise and identify the most material 

economic, environmental and social impacts of our business operations through reviewing our 

existing company policies, compliance requirements, employee surveys, risk registers and 

benchmarking material issues reported by peers. While assessing our sustainability impacts, risks 

and opportunities, we considered the expectations and concerns of our critical stakeholders. We 

also examined sustainability trends in the industry sector and reporting practices of peer 

companies. Through this exercise, we identified and prioritised material topics as shown in the 

following table. Material topics have been reviewed and approved by our Board. 

 



1. ISSUE IDENTIFICATION

A benchmarking exercise and desktop research were conducted to assess if there 

were any key or emerging issues not included from Karin’s original list of material 

issues. This was to ensure that Karin has a comprehensive picture of what issues 

might be material and to form the basis of the engagement stages. The list was 

then consolidated through the grouping of related issues. The outcome was a 

shortlist of 15 issues for prioritisation.





2. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Using the findings gathered from Step 1, an online survey was distributed to both

internal and external stakeholders to gather perspectives on what the most

important sustainability issues are for the business to prioritise. The survey uses

both the Likert scale (rating from 1-5) and a ranking system, in addition to

qualitative questions to gather feedback. The surveys yielded responses from

employees and external stakeholders.





3. PRIOTIZATION, VALIDATION AND ENDORSEMENT

An analysis was done to consolidate the results gathered to produce a preliminary

list

of

material

issues

prioritised

by

internal

and

external

perspectives,

represented in the form of a materiality matrix. The prioritised set of material

issues were presented to the Board for review for final endorsement.

Materiality Matrix and Boundary Mapping 

The materiality matrix below shows the output from the materiality assessment. A 

comprehensive list of 15 material issues considered was plotted against the x-axis, which shows 

the importance of each issue on the business, and against the y-axis, which shows how important 

each issue is for Karin to manage according to external stakeholders.

ECONOMIC 

Anti-corruption 

[GRI 103, GRI 205-3] 

Karin is committed to fostering a culture of corporate compliance, ethical behaviour and good 

corporate governance. We adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards corruption and manage the 

risks through prevention and detection of frauds and irregularities.  

The Group strictly abides by the laws and regulations relating to bribery, extortion, fraud and 

money laundering in Hong Kong, including the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance and Anti-Money 

Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance. 

The Group has established “Employee’s Code of Conduct”, which is part of the Employee 

Handbook, setting out the employee’s conducts in dealing with problems related to acceptance 

of advantages and conflicts of interest so as to educate the importance of ethics and integrity. 

It is circulated among employees to educate the importance of ethics and integrity. 

Internal Control Procedures 

Other than the internal anti-bribery and corruption guidelines as stipulated in the Employee 

Handbook, the Group has in place a Whistle-blowing Policy, which is publicly posted on our 

website, as a communication channel for employees to report concerns relating to the ethical 

business or personal conduct, accounting and financial matters, integrity and professionalism, 

or allegations of retaliation for having reported matters in good faith.  


 

 Sustainability Report 2021| 20 

 

 

Employees are encouraged and welcomed to report his/her concerns via email anonymously. 

After completion of an investigation, the Audit and Risk Management Committee shall review 

the actions taken by the Company towards the whistle-blowing initiative and ensure fraudulent 

practices are reviewed without prejudice, and executed with professional integrity in 

compliance with the Company’s policy.  

The Group has also implemented appropriate and effective internal controls at different business 

processes to prevent and detect fraudulent activities. The Group also provides training for 

employees relating to anti-corruption and ensures that departmental managers and executives 

are sufficiently trained and developed to implement the whistle-blowing policy. Fraud 

assessment exercise is conducted annually and reported to the Board. 

In FY 2021, the Group was not aware of any confirmed incidents of corruption. Moving forward, 

the Group will continue to implement whistleblowing and other policies to prevent corruption 

and maintain zero confirmed incidents for corruption.

ENVIRONMENTAL 

Energy and Emissions 

[GRI 103] 

Karin is committed to minimising the environmental impact of our business through resources 

utilisation and conservation. We notice that there is a gradual concern from the community on 

climate changes due to the increase in energy consumption and its incurred greenhouse gas (GHG) 

emissions. The Group’s warehouses and offices consume electricity for lighting, air conditioning, 

office equipment and other uses. The Group has implemented energy-saving strategies in the 

office to mitigate energy consumption as well as greenhouse gas emissions. Some key practices 

implemented are as follows: 

� Switch off electrical appliances when they are not in use (such as air-conditioning, 

computer, printer, photocopier, lighting, etc.)

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions 

[GRI 305-1,305-2,305-3, 305-4] 

In response to the community’s gradual concern on greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, climate 

changes and other related issues, the Group has begun to record and report the GHG emission 

annually through sustainability report. In order to be in line with the best practice of GHG 

emissions disclosure, the disclosure was extended in FY 2021. The GHG emissions disclosure was 

divided into three scopes.  

◆ 

Scope 1: The direct emission from the business operations owned or controlled by the Group, 

including the emission from the Group’s vehicle fleet 

◆ 

Scope 2: The “indirect energy” emissions from the internal purchased electricity 

consumption by the Group 

◆ 

Scope 3: All other indirect emissions that occur outside the Group, including both upstream 

and downstream emissions, such as the emissions due to business travel, electricity used 

for freshwater processing by the Water Services Department, electricity sewage processing 

by the Drainage Services Department, methane generation at landfill due to disposal of 

paper wastes and general wastes 

 

 


 

 Sustainability Report 2021| 24 

 

In FY 2021, the primary sources of GHG emission are from petrol consumption, electricity 

consumption, wastes and employee business travel. Scope 2 is the major contributor to the total 

GHG emissions.

SOCIAL 

Employment 

[GRI 103, 401-1, 401-2] 

Karin believes that the continued service of our management team and skilled employees is one 

of our key success factors. Having a team of experienced management staff and skilled personnel 

is critical in maintaining the quality of our services and our relationship with our customers. A 

high turnover of such personnel without suitable and timely replacements will adversely affect 

our operations and competitiveness. The Group strictly abides by the laws and regulations 

relating to employment in Hong Kong, including the Employment Ordinance, Minimum Wage 

Ordinance, the Employees’ Compensation Ordinance and the Sex Discrimination Ordinance. 

As the business grows, Karin must establish sustainable human capital to attract and retain 

talents. The Group has formulated policies and initiatives with respect to discrimination, 

compensations, promotion, privacy and other relating matters. The Group is committed to 

providing equal opportunities to all its employees. The Group’s recruitments of employees and 

their subsequent annual appraisal are based on merit, work attitude, cooperation with other 

staff &amp; workers, and their efficiency and effectiveness of work. Furthermore, the Group does 

not discriminate according to race, age, gender, religion, ethnicity, facial attractiveness, 

physical impairments, sexual preference, political viewpoints or nationality.  

 

Remuneration, promotion and dismissal 

The Group determines employees’ remunerations based on factors such as qualifications, duties, 

contributions and experience. We have a robust system to assess the performance of the 

employees, which forms the basis of determination on salary increments, bonus and promotion.  


 

 Sustainability Report 2021| 26 

 

For employee termination, employment might be terminated for non-performance, breach of 

policies, gross misconduct. For voluntary resignation, an exit interview is conducted with the 

resigned employee so the Group would identify employee concern or dissatisfaction. 

 

Working hours and rest periods 

The Group committed to offering reasonable working hours and rest period to employees. In 

general, employees work on average 40 hours per week. Employee's working hours may be re-

scheduled by his supervisor to suit operational needs. All employees shall be entitled to General 

Holidays as announced in the Hong Kong SAR Government Gazette each year. In addition to 

general holidays, employees are entitled to annual leave, birthday leave, marriage leave, 

maternity leave and sick leave. 

 

Employee benefits and welfare  

According to the applicable laws and regulations in Hong Kong, the Group provides various 

benefits and welfare to the employees. The Group participates in the defined contribution 

scheme (the “MPF Scheme”) under the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance which is 

available to its employees in Hong Kong. Contributions to the MPF Scheme by the Group and 

employees are made based on a percentage of employees’ basic salaries. The Group’s employer 

contributions vest fully with the employees when contributed to the MPF Scheme. The Group 

also provides medical insurance and compensation insurance. The Group provides monetary 

awards, such as discretionary bonus, share options to employees. 

During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, engaging events were limited due to social 

distancing measures. In order to create a cohesive workplace and promote team bonding, the 

Group distributed Christmas treats gift set to all employees instead of Christmas Party in 2020. 

To promote health and wellness among employees, we also supported our employees to 

participate in various activities such as sports, Chinese Kungfu and yoga.

Occupational Health and Safety 

[GRI 103, 403-5, 403-6, 403-9] 

Karin attaches great importance to the health of its employees and is committed to providing a 

safe and healthy working environment for them. The Group maintains medical insurance for its 

employees and adopts practices regarding work safety and occupational health issues. Safety 

arrangements in cases of emergency such as during typhoons and rainstorm warnings are stated 

in the Employee Handbook to ensure that all employees are aware of emergency procedures. 

The guidance for manual handling operation is specifically introduced to employees who work 

in the warehouse in the orientation training.  

In FY 2021, the Group was not aware of any case of work-related injury, occupational disease 

nor fatality. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group responded with a combination 

of measures for infection prevention and control. Moving forward, the Group will continue to 

educate new employees about the manual handling operations and review if any material risks 

in this area.

Training and Education 

[GRI 103, 404-3] 

Karin places a great deal of importance on the career development and training of our employees. 

Due to the technical nature of our business, staff training is important in ensuring that we keep 

ourselves abreast of product knowledge and the changing needs of our customers. 

The Group has in place procedures to provide a system and instruction for determining training 

and competence development needs, providing training and maintaining training records. It also 

sets out organizational knowledge and how it is available to the extent necessary.  

Our staff regularly attends scheduled training courses and seminars, including those conducted 

and sponsored by our MNC suppliers and component manufacturers, to enable our technical staff 

to become more familiar with existing and new IT infrastructure, computer data storage 

management products and new component applications. These courses serve to enhance our 

awareness of the latest products or upgrades available. These courses also offer in-depth 

knowledge in some of the latest technologies and insight into the current market trends and 

other economic factors affecting the electronics industry. Our staff who attends such training 

courses will disseminate the knowledge gained to the rest of the team through internal meetings 

and training seminars. In addition, technical knowledge is also acquired through on-the-job 

training where guidance and supervision are provided by the more experienced staff. 

We also place a strong emphasis on developing our management staff through courses which 

focus on developing management and analytical skills. Our management staff also attends 

regular industry seminars and conferences which address general technological trends, 

developments in the electronics industry and economic factors and policies that affect our 

business. 

In FY 2021, the Group provided 58 internal and external products and technical training to our 

employees and the total training hour received by our employees was 496.5. Moving forward, 

the Group will continue to identify the training needs for employee and encourage employees 

to attend training by providing incentives.

Quality Management 

[GRI 103] 

Karin adopts the highest industry quality standards to provide exceptional customer service. In 

order to display our commitment on providing satisfying products and services, we have 

established Quality Policy and ensure the policy is understood, implemented and maintained at 

all levels of employees. Quality management is essential for us to meet customer requirements 

and increase customer satisfaction. We have attained ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management 

Systems certification. 

We conduct visual quality checks on products distributed by our Components Distribution 

segment for damages made during transit. For our IC Application Design segment, our field 

application design engineers check to ensure that the product prototype we designed meet our 

clients’ specification and will be approved by them. Products that we assembled for our 

customers under the IT Infrastructure segment are tested by our engineers, certified by our 

vendors, before delivery. Products that do not pass our quality checks are returned to the 

relevant suppliers. 

For our IT Infrastructure segment, our Group’s IT storage and service management team provides 

technical support, maintenance and consultation services to our customers. 

Our Quality Assurance Manager is responsible to monitor the compliance of ISO requirements on 

a timely basis and provides training to employees in order to raise their awareness of the 

requirements, ensuring the quality services and support to the customers and stakeholders. The 

quality objectives were monitored with data analysis and support. Annual audit is carried out by 

the external ISO auditor to access our overall performance.  

In FY 2021, the overall performance of the quality management system was considered 

satisfactory by the external ISO auditor. Moving forward, the Group will continue to review our 

Quality Policy and update to meet the requirement of ISO 9001:2015.

Firewall and anti-virus solution are installed to protect the internal network and 

prevent the computers from virus infection. 

� 

Confidential information should be communicated through formal Company’s email 

instead of mobile applications.
