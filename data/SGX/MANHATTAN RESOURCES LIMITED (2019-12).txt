ABOUT MANHATTAN RESOURCES LIMITED GROUP (THE “GROUP”) 

 

Our Markets 

Manhattan Resources Limited (the “Company”) is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled 

in Singapore. The Company is listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX”). 

Headquartered in Singapore, the Group’s core businesses include ship chartering and power plant in 

Indonesia, property development in China and mining, extraction and sale of mineral resources in China. 

The ship chartering business primarily serves the Indonesian market with its main customers in the coal 

mining industry. The power plant business operates in Indonesia where it supplies electricity to both state-

owned utility company and private companies. The property development business in China is in its 

construction phase and will be targeting the retail, office and Soho sectors.  

Our Supply Chain 

With the business nature of the Group, our supply chain operates primarily in the energy resources 

industry with vendors supplying coal to the power plant business and fuel to the shipping business. The 

property development business engages consultants and contractors in the construction industry. We 

value a stable and efficient supply chain. Suppliers across our businesses are assessed in accordance with 

our procurement policies before being qualified as our list of approved vendors. We perform evaluation 

on new vendors and regularly re-assess the performance of our existing key suppliers. Our end-in-mind is 

to secure a pool of reliable suppliers that share our commitment to sustainability.   

Further information on the company’s profile can be found in our annual report publicly available on the 

SGX’s website.  

ABOUT THE REPORT 

This report summarises our approach towards sustainability and provides an annual update on our 

sustainability performance and progress for the period 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. Our report 

has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core option and 

Singapore Exchange’s Practice Note 7.6 Sustainability Reporting Guide. GRI is an internationally 

recognised sustainability framework and has been chosen for its robust guidelines and suitability to our 

business model. This report has also taken into consideration the primary components of report content 

as set out by the SGX’s “Comply or Explain” requirements for sustainability reporting. We have not sought 

external assurance for this reporting period.

OUR ENVIRONMENT 

We understand the importance of managing our impact on the environment, even more so with the 

nature of our businesses and operations. Specifically, air and water pollutions are the major 

environmental pressure caused by the power plant, shipping operations and property development.  

We strive to operate responsibly in order to minimise our environmental footprints wherever we 

operate in. In the coming year, the Group will continue upholding business practices and observing 

measures in mitigating emissions and wastage. Environmental sustainability will remain a key 

consideration in all our businesses. 

Power plant business 

Air, waste water and ash emissions are carefully handled to prevent any toxic emission and minimise 

environmental pollution. Our waste management processes ensure that our power plant units are 

well-equipped to adequately filter all waste before discharging. The coal we use for our coal-fired 

steam power plant are of low sulphur content, minimising the impact of coal burning and the harmful 

ash content. Routine checks by the operation team help assure that the power plant units are 

operating properly. Regular tests and laboratory analyses are conducted to monitor the parameters 

of the waste emissions. We are proud to report that there have been no cases of fines or non-

monetary sanctions for any non-compliance with regulatory requirements in the year 2019. For the 

upcoming year we target to continuously maintain our current clean record. 

Shipping business 

Marine pollution remains one of the major environmental concerns in the shipping sector. Scheduled 

repair and maintenance of our fleet aid in ensuring that our vessels along with their engines and 

equipment are operating properly at all times. Independent inspections are conducted to certify that 

each of our vessels is adequately equipped to mitigate and prevent pollution as well as complying with 

the regulatory requirements. For the year 2019, we are pleased to report that our fleet have met with 

the regulatory requirements and no cases of non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance have been 

reported. For the upcoming year we target to continuously maintain our current clean record.  

Property development business 

We recognised that a healthy environment and symbiotic relationship with nature is critical to the 

sustainability of businesses. The Ningbo Yinzhou Manhattan Tower will have a greening rate of 

approximately 20%. The design also aims to maximise use of natural lighting to reduce electricity 

consumption. Energy efficient lightings will also be installed to increase the efficiency of energy usage. 

During the construction phrase, electricity from power grid supply is used to reduce reliance on diesel 

generators to further decrease our carbon footprint.  For the operations of asset, we intend to use 

computer-based energy management system to optimise chiller efficiency and Building Management 

System (BMS) to control key equipment in order to effectively control and reduce energy use.

OUR PEOPLE 

We operate in specialised industries which are labour intensive. With over 80 employees in the various 

geographical locations that the Group operates in, our employees are the core drivers of our 

businesses and we stay committed in providing a safe and inclusive workplace for our people. 

A safe and healthy workplace 

Given the nature of our businesses in the power plant, shipping and property development sectors, 

workplace safety is a priority for the Group. We are committed in creating a safe working environment 

and achieving zero fatalities. We have in place a stringent set of safety practices and processes. 

Communication and implementation of safety measures and policies are taken very seriously across 

all our businesses to ensure that all staff understands the practices and the magnitude of the 

consequences. We believe not just in creating a safe working environment but also constantly 

promoting responsible workplace behaviors in our people.  

The Group is pleased to report zero fatalities across all our business segments in the year. We will 

keep on reviewing and improving our safety standards throughout all our business operations so as to 

prevent fatalities and minimise any injuries.  

A diverse and inclusive workforce 

Our people span across various functions, locations and languages. Our recruitment and 

compensation policies are based on merit and office discrimination is strictly disallowed as outlined in 

our Code of Ethics and Conduct. We value diversity at every level of our organisation and provide 

equal employment opportunities regardless of gender and age. With that being said, due to the nature 

of our businesses, employees deployed in the forefront of our operations have been dominated by 

the male population. This group of employees represents the crew in the shipping segment, the 

operation and maintenance workers in the power plant segment and the workers in the property 

development segment. During the year, there have been no cases of grievances concerning any 

discrimination or unfair employment practices reported. We will continue to uphold the principle of 

equal opportunities and respect the rights of our people.

Talent development 

Our achievements would not have been possible without our people. Capable leaders along with 

skilled and competent staff are especially critical for a growing organisation like us. Retaining the right 

people and keeping them motivated has become our ongoing strategy towards a sustainable business 

model. We seek to attract and retain the best staff through our remuneration packages and 

development opportunities. Staff are encouraged and given the resources to pursue training and skills 

upgrading opportunities. Annual performance appraisals are conducted to acknowledge our 

employees’ achievements in the year, and to help them identify areas for continuous growth and track 

their career progression. As the Group progresses on, we will continue our long term goal of 

developing and empowering our people.  

Benefits and welfare  

Beyond the competitive remuneration, the Group also provide a comprehensive welfare and benefits 

scheme, including medical and dental benefits for all our full-time employees. We also adopt benefits 

in line with Singapore government’s pro-family legislation.  Mothers and fathers whose children are 

Singapore Citizens at birth get to enjoy maternity leave of 16 weeks and paternity leave of two weeks 

respectively, as advocated by the Singapore government. 3 employees with at least one Singapore 

Citizen child under the age of seven were entitled to six days of paid childcare leave in 2019.

GOVERNANCE 

Good corporate governance practices delineate the Group’s business conduct and our attitude to 

ethical matters. The Group’s corporate governance practices are guided by the Singapore Code of 

Corporate Governance issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Such practices help ensure 

accountability and transparency within the Group and in turn maintain an operating environment 

which serves the interests of all stakeholders.  

The Board is the Group’s highest governance body that provides an oversight of the Group’s business 

affair. The Board is responsible for the overall corporate governance and provides leadership and 

guidance on business strategies, succession planning, risk management, internal controls and financial 

performance. To efficiently manage its responsibilities, certain functions have been delegated to the 

three board committees, namely the Audit Committee (“AC”), Nominating Committee (“NC”) and 

Remuneration Committee (“RC”). Each of the committees has its own written terms of reference 

whose actions are reported to and monitored by the Board. 

Our corporate governance practices and internal Code of Ethics and Conduct call for all employees to 

act with the highest standard of integrity, ensuring that we operate ethically across all our businesses. 

Our whistle-blowing policy also encourages and provides a channel for stakeholders to report and to 

raise, in good faith and in confidence, their concerns about possible improprieties in all matters. Going 

forward, we will continue to stay committed in instilling good governance practices across the Group. 

More details about our corporate governance can be found in the “Report on Corporate Governance” 

in our annual report.
