ValueMax Group Limited | Sustainability Report 2020 1

Sustainability is critical for the long term success of any enterprise, especially enterprises with the conviction to achieve triple 

bottomline, namely People, Profit, Planet, for the benefits of both the private enterprise and the society. 

At ValueMax Group Limited, we are committed to uphold high standards of Economic, Social and Governance (ESG) practices 

within our organisation and embrace our corporate social responsibility with conviction and fervour.

We believe our sustainable growth and success is only possible with the sustainable development of the communities we 

operate in, be they social, business or national communities. 

Driving long term sustainability is our vision. Centred on our key material issues, we have charted a four pronged approach 

to our sustainable development roadmap. We will endeavour to set ourselves on the journey of achieving a good balance in 

financial growth as well as ESG performance.

Corporate social responsibility is in the DNA of our organisation. As one of the market leaders in both the pawnbroking 

and money-lending industries, we demonstrate our commitment through the adoption of responsible lending and borrowing 

practices. The Group is committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations related to the prevention of money 

laundering and terrorism financing. The Board expects all Group employees to be vigilant to prevent any illegal use of the Group’s 

products and services by money launderers, terrorists or those financing terrorist activities.

To reflect this commitment, the Company has developed a Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (PMLTF) 

Framework and the related procedures and controls by drawing on practices from other related industries with significant 

PMLTF compliance activities.

Managing risks well and capitalising on opportunities within sight for future returns are key to ensuring sustainable profitability. 

In 2020, we were awarded the certificate of achievement under the Centurion Category for: Overall Sector Winner; the Fastest-

Growing Company and the Most Profitable Company in the Banking &amp; Investment Services and Insurance Sector Category 

by The Edge, Singapore. The award is a recognition of excellence for companies listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX).

Being a responsible corporate citizen, we believe in reducing carbon footprint as well as giving back to the society by actively 

participating in business and community initiatives.  Over the years, we have taken the lead to implement several major key 

initiatives such as embarking on the e-shop programme to monitor our water and energy consumption, donating to UOB’s 

heartbeat charity campaign, actively supporting the community through People’s Association Citizens’ Consultative Committees, 

and caring for the special needs children and lonely seniors staying in one-room flats.

Moving forward, we are committed to invest in strengthening our staff training and development roadmap. We believe that long 

term investment in human capital is the key to the long term sustainable success of ValueMax Group.

our commitments to sustainable development. Senior management is responsible for on-going communication to the Board 

of Directors.

Economic Contribution to Society

Each of our outlets is operated by a team of professional valuers and operations staff, overseen by ValueMax’s corporate office. 

We manage our operations in accordance to our sustainability principles. We work closely with our management and operation 

staff to identify and consider any sustainability opportunities and risks that may arise.  

Sustainability trends such as climate change, resource scarcity and demographic changes shape the competitive environment 

in which ValueMax operates by introducing long term sustainability opportunities and recognising risks. We therefore view our 

business performance beyond short term gains and financial bottomline. Our conviction is to achieve a balanced triple bottomline 

in ‘People, Profit, Planet’ for sustainable growth both for the organisation and the community it operates in.

The success of our business is highly dependent on the commitment of our management and staff. Their knowledge, professional 

expertise and their job satisfaction are key to our economic sustainability.  

More importantly, we strive to contribute positively to the society through our economic presence by contributing to the range 

of short to medium term credit facilities to individuals and corporations, while maintaining good stewardship of the resources 

we manage and generate good shareholders’ value.

Our business model focuses on cost leadership without compromising our service level and highest priority on customers’ 

interest. We seek organic growth from the existing outlets as well as through the acquisition of new businesses that reap good 

returns.

We strive to maintain our market position by ensuring we gain the trust of our customers and their families, while consistently 

building our reputation and brand name in the pawnbroking, moneylending, retail and gold trading industry.    

In today’s highly volatile business environment, ValueMax has, beyond sustained earnings, diligently embraced prudent financial 

management, capitalised on our assets and investments, and remained focused on growth strategies, to enhance shareholders’ 

value.

For more information on ValueMax’s financial and business performance, please refer to Annual Report FY2020.

With zero-tolerance policy on bribery and corruption, we have in place effective monitoring and management control systems to 

detect bribery, fraud or other malpractice activities directly at the source. We have established a whistle-blowing mechanism for 

employees and any other concerned stakeholders such as customers and their families, suppliers, competitors and contractors. 

A direct whistle-blowing channel has also been implemented to enable our employees to get direct access to our Managing 

Director and CEO as well as our Chairman of Audit Committee. By doing so, our stakeholders can be assured that all reports or 

suspicion of potential breaches of our Employee guidelines are taken seriously by the Group. Our stakeholders can also reach 

our Executive Director or CFO via telephone or email through the contact information listed on our website.

Anti-Corruption and Anti-Fraud

Legal Compliance and Corporate Governance

Ethics and Integrity  

 

We promote an ethical and ‘act with integrity’ culture throughout the Group and our outlets. We seek to conduct our business 

in an ethical manner and in compliance with the best practices in the pawnbroking and moneylending industries. All Directors, 

valuers, operations and management staff are required to fully comply with our principles set in our Employee Handbook and 

employment contract.

Corporate governance and compliance have always been one of the top priorities for the Group. The decision-making process 

in the Group is strictly in line with legal and regulatory requirements under the Ministry of Law and in compliance with the Code 

of Corporate Governance issued by Monetary Authority of Singapore and the guidelines of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. 

ValueMax is a member of both Singapore Pawnbrokers Association and Credit Association of Singapore which have regular 

meetings with the regulating authorities under the Ministry of Law.

In FY2018, the Group received a fine from the Registry of Pawnbrokers for having an employee from the pawnbroking business 

assists in retail sales for three of the outlets. The regulation has since changed and pawnbroking employees are now permitted 

to assist in retail sales. The Group has not received any other notification in relation to any non-compliance of current legislation.

GOVERNANCE


ValueMax Group Limited | Sustainability Report 2020 13

Compliance with Laws and Regulations

Responsible Lending and Anti-Money Laundering

The Group is proactive in ensuring its compliance with all relevant laws and regulations across all outlets. Our management team 

is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Group’s policies and practices in respect to legal and regulatory requirements 

across all outlets. Any non-compliance of the relevant laws and regulations and the proposed resolutions will be reported to 

the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.    

The Group has put in place policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the relevant laws and regulations, particularly 

those relating to Pawnbrokers Act and Moneylenders Act. At the corporate level, we also ensure that we are in compliance, 

both in substance and in spirit, with the Listing rules of Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited, Securities and Futures 

Act and Singapore Companies Act.  

Any new enactment of or changes to the relevant laws and regulations will be communicated to all operations and management 

staff via emails and small group meetings. Such communication is necessary to ensure that all staff are aware of the changes 

and can carry out the necessary steps and actions to ensure compliance.  

While we seek to leverage our data to serve our customers responsibly, we adhere and uphold the Personal Data Protection 

Act (“PDPA”). We have put in place policies to ensure we are in compliance with PDPA and we respect our customers’ choices 

in respect of their personal data and the protection of our customers’ privacy.  

The main purpose for which personal data is collected by ValueMax in Singapore is to furnish information to our customers 

pertaining to our products and services, to record their credit loans and their accounts, process payments, to address questions 

and feedback, as well as where permitted under law, to send them our marketing and promotional offers on products and 

services, as well as personalised content and advertising based on their preferences and demographics. 

There has been no incidence of product and service misinformation, mis-labelling or inapproprate marketing communications.

ValueMax has established policies and procedures to manage risks for its moneylending, pawnbroking, gold trading and retail 

businesses.

The Group is committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations related to the prevention of money laundering 

and terrorism financing, and to deterring customers, suppliers, borrowers and pawners from using ValueMax as a conduit for 

illegal activity. The Board expects all employees to be vigilant to prevent any illegal use of the Group's products and services 

by money launderers, terrorists or those financing terrorist activities.

To reflect this commitment, the Group has developed a Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (“PMLTF”) 

Framework and the related procedures and controls by drawing on best practices from related financial industries with significant 

PMLTF compliance activities.

The objectives of this Framework are:

 • To protect the Group from having its products and services used by money launderers, terrorists and parties that finance  

  terrorist activities;

 • To protect the reputation of the Group;

 • To achieve compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements;

 • To identify and adopt strong, risk-based industry practices in relation to PMLTF.

Risk Management

Supply Chain and Procurement Practices

Service Quality and Responsibility

The Group recognises the importance of risk management and how business risks may adversely affect ValueMax’s business 

performance. Since 2013, we started our Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) framework to roll out a systematic approach 

to identify, assess and manage risks. We are pleased to update all stakeholders that our ERM framework is now fully 

implemented.

While it is the responsibility of the Audit Committee, as delegated by the Board of Directors, to oversee the effectiveness of our 

risk management and internal controls, the core function of the ERM framework is coordinated by our Chief Financial Officer 

who reports to the Audit Committee on a periodic basis. 

For further details on Risk Management, please refer to corporate governance section of Annual Report FY2020.

Our supply chain constitutes mainly the suppliers for our gold trading and retail businesses for all our outlets, of which a strong 

partnership with the suppliers has been maintained.

We believe in transparency in our supply chain and our approach is to positively engage with suppliers if any issues have been 

identified. Any non-compliance with the guidelines of local and international regulatory bodies will result in us not embarking on 

the procurement and business relationship with them.

Our service quality and responsibility to our customers rank high for the sustainable success 

of the Group. We are committed to provide fair valuation of the valuables our customers bring 

to our chain of outlets and we emphasise on service excellence for every customer.   

Our valuers and professional staff serve our customers professionally and ethically. Customers 

are advised on the valuation of their collaterals based on the current market price as well as 

the terms of their contracts. 

There has been no incidence of non-compliance with laws and regulations in the social and 

economic area.

Water and Energy Conservation

We believe our business has a low impact on the environment. Nevertheless, we strive to embrace environmental sustainability 

by managing environmental conservation through adopting waste minimisation, recycling and energy effcient practices.  

We have installed LED lightings at our headquarters and new outlets as our first step towards energy conservation.

With our flagship store at Waterloo Centre being newly certified as an Eco-shop in 2018, four of our outlets have embarked on the 

Eco-shop programme in collaboration with the Singapore Environmental Council (“SEC”). The project aligns our environmental 

performance in the four outlets to key evaluation criterion like indoor environment and air quality, resource recovery and recycling, 

water and energy conservation.

Target

We intend to roll out the same eco-shop standard to all our shops over a period of 3 years.

We tap on the water supply provided by Public Utilities Board and dispose used water into the public sewage system.

Water and electricity usage declined in 2020 due largely to us operating a skeletal network of 9 outlets out of 35 then during 

the almost two-month Circuit Breaker from April to June 2020. Notwithstanding this, our organization-wide effort to consciously 

conserve water and electricity usage continues unabated. 

Paper Usage

We have launched our Go-Green initiatives across all our outlets and corporate office. The implemented initiatives aim to 

encourage the ‘Reduce, Re-use, and Recycle’ of papers through the following ways:    

• Reducing the use of papers by printing on both sides of the paper and printing only when necessary. 

• Re-using single-side printed papers for non-confidential and draft documents. We plan to roll out electronic and paperless  

 daily operations reports.

• We are committed to use paper from sustainable sources where possible.

• We are looking into recycling all used papers and printed materials by donating to authorised recycling companies.

Diversity and Equal Opportunity

Pivotal to our success is our people performing at their best. We value the contributions by all employees towards sustaining 

ValueMax’s long term success. To underscore our care and commitment towards our employees, ValueMax’s holistic human 

resource (“HR”) strategy focuses on fair remuneration and equal opportunities, training and development, employee wellness 

and engagement, and work-life harmony. We are taking progressive steps to go beyond mere compliance with labour laws in 

Singapore to develop and implement policies and staff engagement programmes that aim to help employees build a long and 

fulfilling career with ValueMax. 

Identifying, recognising and rewarding performance in employees is essential in our hiring and retention strategy. We advocate 

fair employment practices by ensuring equal opportunities for recruitment, fair compensation, career progression and training 

opportunities. We provide fair employment opportunities to all, regardless of age, gender, race, or nationality. ValueMax advocates 

a policy of harnessing diversity in human resource as evidenced by a fair distribution of employees from varied nationalities and 

age groups to support our key markets in Singapore and Malaysia. 

We advocate gender diversity in our Board, with two female directors among our six Board members.

There is a balanced gender ratio between the male and female employees. We ensure that fair work practices and remuneration 

are ascertained based on individual work performance and not on any gender consideration. No form of discrimination is 

tolerated within our organisation. There has been no incidence of discrimination reported during the year.

We maintain a policy of employee diversity through providing employment opportunities to both young and older workers above 

55 years old. As at 31 December 2020, the youngest staff is 22 years old while we have five senior staff aged 70 and above.

Age Profile of Employees

The recruitment and retention of talents include cooperation with professional institutions, talent pool development and retention, 

and staff grievance mechanism.

In terms of employee skills profile, we have maintained a fair proportion of professional and management team to lead and drive 

the business growth in our four main business segments.

Our business is dependent on experienced staff who have been in the pawnbroking business for over 10-20 years. Through the 

acquisition of new businesses over the years, we have also retained the workforce of the acquired entities and strengthened 

our pool of senior valuers whose professional expertise in valuation of jewellery and watches has been critical in the sustainable 

success of our pawnbroking business.

We are continuously recruiting talents, particularly younger talents and grooming them through mentorship and on-the-job 

training programme.

Our recruitment policy is based on meritocracy and the pre-requisite skills and academic qualifications required to perform the 

required job scope. During recruitment, we implement stringent shortlisting processes to ensure we recruit people with the 

same values as we do.  

We focus on retention of talents by providing fair and sustainable financial and non-financial incentives, and through learning 

and development opportunities. Our compensation and benefits policies are determined by guidelines proposed by our human 

resource team and approved by our Management team or our Board. All our staff undergo an annual performance review and 

receive periodic performance feedback from their reporting managers.

 needs to know what are the areas they need to improve on, and for those with high potential, career tracks are developed  

 to give them a career roadmap of where they can advance progressively within ValueMax. Trainings through conferences and
