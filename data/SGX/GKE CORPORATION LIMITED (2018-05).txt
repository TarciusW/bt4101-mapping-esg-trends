CONTENTS


This report marks GKE’s first year 

of 

sustainability 

reporting. 

The 

Board believes this report is a 

reasonable and clear presentation 

of the company’s plans and of 

its 

environmental, 

social 

and 

governance performance. The Board 

has emphasised that management 

will continue to be evaluated by its 

success in executing the company’s 

strategic plan to meet stakeholders’ 

and 

the 

Board’s 

expectations, 

including being agile in responding 

to changing circumstances while 

respecting the commitments in this 

report. 

Our Strategy

At GKE, sustainability is approached 

holistically to create and continuously 

improve a sustainable company 

delivering long term value for all our 

stakeholders: customers, employees, 

suppliers, 

investors 

and 

the 

communities in which we operate. 

We believe that sustainability is 

everyone’s job and that a sound 

corporate sustainability governance 

framework 

promotes 

strong 

leadership by all our management.

Cost 

competitiveness 

and 

productivity, maintaining excellence 

in service and quality are some of 

the challenges that we face in our 

industry. Hence, we are constantly 

exploring new opportunities to grow 

our business and enter new markets. 

To maintain our strong and consistent 

focus, we are building on our existing 

framework and using new insights to 

deepen our approach. We also need 

to deliver our products and services 

in an innovative and sustainable 

way, which means listening to and 

collaborating with our stakeholders, 

and 

becoming 

more 

agile 

in 

innovating new solutions. 

Sustainability Framework

This report has been prepared 

in 

accordance 

with 

the 

SGX 

Sustainability Reporting Guidelines 

and the Global Reporting Initiative 

(GRI) Standards.  

Sustainability Governance

The 

Board 

has 

assigned 

the 

responsibility 

for 

monitoring 

and 

overseeing 

the 

company’s 

sustainability 

efforts 

to 

the 

Sustainability Committee, which is 

chaired by the Board of Directors 

and which comprises a Sustainability 

Head 

and 

9 

other 

members 

representing 

different 

business 

units in GKE. The Board reviewed 

and discussed the final text of this 

report before its adoption of a formal 

resolution approving the report.

Managing Sustainability

In 2018, 4 focus areas aligned to our 

sustainability approach were defined: 

The Board maintained oversight 

over the Sustainability Committee, 

managing sustainability risks and 

opportunities, while ensuring all 

Environment, Social and Governance 

(ESG) matters significant to our 

business are addressed in our 4 

focus areas.

Our customers and various business 

units have been engaged to better 

understand what their concerns 

are. Data privacy and resilience, as 

well as health and safety, issues that 

are fundamental to our business 

relationships with our customers and 

trust in our Company, will be further 

strengthened. Our employees will 

also be cross trained, enabling them 

to be adaptable in the ever-changing 

environment. 

We 

remain 

committed 

in 

our 

relentless pursuit to expand our 

business 

portfolio 

while 

driving 

synergies among the subsidiaries 

within our core warehousing and 

logistics 

division 

and 

providing 

seamless solutions and services in 

supply chain management.

GKE’S SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH  



CORE 

VALUES

Customer 

Focused

People

Integrity

The sustainability focus for GKE 

is delivering long-term value for 

all our stakeholders: customers, 

employees, 

investors 

and 

the 

communities in which we operate. 

Within this sustainability approach, 

we take the broader economic, 

governance and social aspects such 

as labour practices, human rights, 

and 

societal 

responsibility 

into 

account. This approach guarantees 

that our services and solutions are 

provided to our customers in a 

manner that is respectful to people, 

the environment and is economically 

smart.

Our services are often a critical 

part of the supply chains of other 

businesses. We help people receive 

the materials they need to create 

products and then help deliver those 

products to their customers. When 

we operate more efficiently, we 

in turn help reduce the emissions 

intensity of supply chains worldwide.

Safety 

Matters

Teamwork

This commitment to sustainability 

involves ensuring that strong ethical, 

social and environmental criteria 

are integrated in our company’s 

strategy and business model and in 

its internal policies and processes. 

We 

are 

committed 

to 

deliver 

effective solutions and services to 

our customers and create greater 

value for our shareholders through 

our core values.

conducted with key representatives 

from the 6 business units, namely 

GKE Warehousing &amp; Logistics Pte 

Ltd, GKE Freight Pte Ltd, Marquis 

Services Pte Ltd, TNS Ocean Lines 

(S) Pte Ltd, GKE Express Logistics 

Pte Ltd and GKE Private Limited. The

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW




In the last one year, GKE has 

distributed around 40% of our 

revenues to key stakeholders – 36% 

to employees, 1.3% to government 

in countries where we operate, 

namely Singapore and China, and 

3% to capital providers. There was 

an overall loss from our continuing 

operations in financial year ended 

31 May 2018 (“FY2018”) and the 

overall economic value retained is 

a negative S$2.7 million (or -3.8% 

of our total revenue). More details 

of our economic performance can 

be found in our GKE Annual Report 

2018.

Regulatory compliance is critically 

important to GKE, serving to protect 

our integrity and reputation and 

foster trust among stakeholders. 

Observance 

of 

all 

regulatory 

requirements forms the basis of 

good corporate governance within 

the Group. We also ensure our 

compliance to all relevant local and 

international laws and regulations, 

including 

the 

principles 

and 

guidelines set out in the Singapore 

Code of Corporate Governance 

2012. More details can be found in 

GKE’s Annual Report 2018.

SOCIOECONOMIC COMPLIANCE 

(GRI 419-1)

In FY2018, we had one case of fine 

by the Singapore Customs due to an 

oversight on a consignment of goods 

(tobacco) which had not been moved 

from the licensed warehouse to the 

duties paid area after the required 

duties had been paid. This incident 

took place over the Lunar New 

Year period and a fine of S$200 was 

imposed on GKE for this oversight 

but additional duties and GST had 

to be paid because there was 

subsequently a change in the excise 

duty on all tobacco products. The 

additional duties and GST payable 

by GKE Warehousing and Logistics 

Pte Ltd for this was approximately 

S$408,000. The company has since 

strengthened the internal controls 

on the movement of duties paid 

cargo. The manager in charge of 

handling movement of cargo has 

also undergone further training to 

ensure he is well-equipped with 

the knowledge of the Singapore 

Customs requirements on managing 

the licensed warehouse. 

We will strive to continue to improve 

on our compliance performance and 

work towards achieving zero non-

compliance cases next year.

ECONOMIC ENHANCEMENT &amp; COMPLIANCE




W e  

are  

se n sitive 

to 

the 

environmental impact across 

our business operations, and are 

committed to taking steps to reduce 

our impact, especially the waste 

generated and GHG emissions. 

Fuel and energy consumption is 

managed and monitored by the 

various business units.

GKE is committed to reducing our 

environmental footprint through 2 

key approaches:

(according to local environmental 

regulations), 

after 

which 

the 

incinerated ash is sent to landfill. 

We are exploring ways to improve 

our waste segregation to improve 

on the volume of recyclables in the 

coming years. 

Last year, we generated 84,300kg 

of 

general 

waste 

which 

was 

incinerated. 10,703kg of carton 

boxes and 9,027kg of plastic shrink 

wrap was recycled, and these 

were generated mostly from our 

warehousing operations. There was 

no hazardous waste disposed in the 

reporting year.

Starting in 2018, iPads are used 

for board meetings to reduce the 

amount of paper used for printing 

minutes 

of 

meetings, 

agendas 

and other attachments. For other 

meetings, projectors are used to 

present meeting materials. As far 

as possible, we are moving towards 

a paperless environment in all our 

business units. During our move 

from 30 Pioneer Road to 39 Benoi 

Road in 2017, the company did not 

purchase new carton boxes but 

instead used recycled carton boxes 

for shifting of our office and these 

were in turn sent for recycling after 

our move was completed.

REDUCING OUR GHG EMISSIONS

 

As a leading warehousing and 

logistics solutions provider, we have 

a dedicated and modern fleet for our 

operational needs. We operate our 

own fleet of vehicles including prime 

movers and trailers. Our vehicles 

from the logistics business account 

for approximately 90% of total fuel 

consumption. This report covers 

only the operations of our own fleet 

of vehicles and the fuel consumption 

attributed to operations of our 

subcontractors is excluded. 

Our total greenhouse gas emissions 

for 

our 

Singapore 

operations 

amounted 

to 

1.8 

tonnes 

CO2 

comprising of Scope 1 emissions 

from use of diesel, largely from our 

vehicles in the logistics business, 

and Scope 2 emissions from the use 

of electricity for our offices, workers 

dormitories and warehouses.

responsibly

WASTE MANAGEMENT (GRI 306-2)

We have identified 3 waste streams 

in our businesses. Where possible, 

we send our waste for recycling 

and reduce the amount of waste 

produced by re-using other items 

such as wooden pallets. The general 

waste is incinerated in Singapore 







GKE CORPORATION LIMITED | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY






Our emissions for the last one year 

are shown in the table below. As this 

is the first year we are calculating 

our CO2 emissions, we intend to use 

the baseline values from this year 

to compare with values for the next 

year so that we can determine our 

targets and areas for improvements 

in the subsequent year. 

Moving forward, we are also in 

the process of replacing the older 

models of our diesel trucks to Euro 

6 models to comply with regulations 

set 

by 

National 

Environmental 

Agency, which will also help to 

reduce 

nitrogen 

oxides 

(NOx) 

pollutants 

and 

fine 

particulate 

matter.  Approximately S$2,000,000 

has 

been 

earmarked 

for 

this 

exercise and a total of 10 trucks will 

be replaced over a period of 2 years.

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY




Engaging with our customers

We aim for complete transparency 

in the way we process and manage 

the data that our clients entrust to 

us. Employees of GKE are required 

to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement 

(NDA) for the work that they 

conduct at GKE. The company’s 

networks, database and websites 

are also secured to prevent loss of 

data. CCTV cameras are installed at 

strategic locations in our facilities 

for physical security, certain offices 

are also biometric controlled for 

greater control and access. 

GLOBAL TRADE

Trade is at the heart of economic 

development and globalisation, and 

today, trade accounts for almost 

60% of global Gross Domestic 

Product (GDP). Based on data from 

The World Bank, this is an increase 

of 41% from 25 years ago. The trade 

to GDP ratio in Singapore is the 

highest in the world (322% as of 

2016, based on data from The World 

Bank). The ratio, also known as the 

trade openness ratio is a ratio that is 

calculated by dividing the total trade 

of a country by the total GDP and 

may been seen as a measurement 

of globalisation. The e-commerce 

revolution continues to disrupt how 

goods and services are bought and 

sold, creating new demands and 

opportunities for our global logistics 

network.

As the world becomes increasingly 

digital, our opportunities continue to 

expand. But with these opportunities 

come ever-more complex challenges 

– such as how to keep personal data 

private and secure, even when it 

moves across borders. We recognise 

the risks and negative impact that 

our 

business 

and 

stakeholders 

may encounter if information such 

as confidential/sensitive corporate 

data, personal data of customers, 

employees and stakeholders, is 

not adequately protected. As we 

harness technology in our business 

and operations, the risks have also 

further increased. Data security and 

privacy is a top priority for us.

DATA PRIVACY (GRI 418-1)

Personal data refers to data, whether 

true or not, about an individual who 

can be identified from that data; or 

from that data and other information 

to which the organisation has or is 

likely to have access. Personal data 

in Singapore is protected under the 

Personal Data Protection Act 2012 

(PDPA). As our privacy practices 

and policies continue to evolve, 

employee awareness is essential. 

Employees who are actively aware 

of privacy issues in their personal 

lives are more likely to be aware 

of privacy issues in the workplace. 

Training and ongoing engagement 

are the primary ways we build 

awareness. 

For 

this 

reporting 

period, there were no substantiated 

complaints 

concerning 

breaches 

of customer privacy and losses of 

customer data across the various 

GKE subsidiaries. 

GKE’s end-to-end logistics services 

covers 

warehousing, 

freight, 

transportation, 

London 

Metal 

Exchange (LME) Metal Warehousing, 

Marine 

Logistics 

and 

Port 

Management. By working with our 

agents / partners in 33 different 

countries, we add value to our client’s 

supply chain through integration of 

land, sea and air transportation from 

country of origin to point of sale, 

avoiding the hassle of having to deal 

with dozens, or even hundreds, of 

different companies. With 11% more 

revenue coming from our export 

business as compared to the import 

business, we are also constantly 

exploring new ways to improve our 

supply chain management and to 

innovate our business. 

Through our subsidiary - G-Chem 

Logistics Pte Ltd, we will strengthen 

the Group’s hazardous chemical 

storage and logistics capabilities 

and broaden our range of services, 

and 

to 

serve 

as 

a 

one-stop 

integrated chemical storage and 

logistics service provider for both 

the chemical and pharmaceutical 

sectors in Singapore.

OUR CUSTOMERS


GOOD LABOUR RELATIONS 

At GKE, we operate on the basis of 

continuous improvement – constantly 

looking for ways that we can be 

more efficient, more responsive, less 

wasteful, more profitable and safer. 

GKE aims to foster an excellence 

culture. 

Our 

employees 

are 

passionate, committed, and excel in 

what they do. In return, we recognise 

their efforts and encourage a culture 

of collaboration. The talent and 

motivation of our 786 employees 

across our various business units 

are the foundations for our success. 

Implementing a strong, common 

culture and purpose across the 

Group remains the main priority of 

our management team.

During 2017/2018 we completed 

a significant restructuring process 

in a number of business areas 

to further improve our efficiency 

and operational excellence. While 

change is sometimes not easy, 

staff were sent for cross training 

in different business units to allow 

them to acquire new skills and to be 

more employable. As such, we did 

not lay off any workers as part of the 

restructuring process. 

GKE strives to work in a healthy and 

safe manner that complies with all 

applicable occupational safety and 

health laws and standards, and 

are committed to providing our 

employees with a healthy and safe 

work environment. Medical and 

dental benefits are also provided to 

our full-time employees.

EMPOWERING EMPLOYEES


EMPLOYEE HEALTH, SAFETY 

AND WELLNESS 

Our people are our most important 

asset. Neglecting their health and 

safety (H&amp;S) would not only be 

irresponsible and unethical but 

would also endanger our business 

performance. Our employees are 

encouraged to take ownership when 

it comes to health and safety. Our 

health and safety approach applies 

at all levels of the organisation, from 

a trip hazard in a corridor at head 

office, to a partially closed truck 

door, or pallets stacked too high in 

a warehouse – all GKE employees 

should see a potential danger and 

take immediate action to resolve. 

Our 

Health 

and 

Safety 

representatives from the various 

business units help to integrate 

health and safety into the daily 

strategic and operational planning 

for the organisation. GKE Express 

Logistics is certified for ISO 9001 

and has achieved WSH bizSAFE 

Level 3 since 2017. GKE has in place 

a Health, Safety and Environment 

system with defined safe work 

procedures, risk assessments and 

other relevant work instructions 

for our staff and contractors. Last 

year, we had 2 cases of reportable 

accidents which resulted in a total of 

137 days lost. We have since made 

improvements to our equipment 

and work procedures to address 

the root cause of these accidents, 

and communicated these to our 

employees to raise their awareness 

on lessons that can be learnt.
