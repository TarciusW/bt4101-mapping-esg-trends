ABOUT THIS REPORT

Genting Singapore has been releasing annual 

sustainability reports since 2013. In our ninth 

edition, we have strengthened our sustainability 

profile and updated our Sustainability Framework, 

through a materiality assessment, to reflect 

developments in our operating context and 

stakeholder concerns.

This Report is prepared in accordance with 

the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards 

– ‘Comprehensive’ option and complies with 

Singapore Exchange (SGX) Listing Rules 711 (A) 

and (B). The GRI Standards were chosen as it is 

an internationally recognised reporting framework 

that provides robust guidance suited for Genting 

Singapore’s business model. Our Greenhouse 

Gas (GHG) emissions are calculated according 

to the principles and standards specified in the 

GHG Protocol Corporate Standard and Corporate 

Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting 

Standard.  

This Report also considers performance 

indicators suggested by environmental, social and 

governance (ESG) rating agencies, and additional 

disclosure suggestions collected through our 

engagement with stakeholders.  

This Report has been prepared with internal 

controls in place. All data included in this report is 

checked to ensure its accuracy against our internal 

systems and signed off by senior management 

team. We plan to seek independent external 

assurance for our future reports. 

The reporting period is from 1 January 2021 to 31 

December 2021 (FY2021), unless otherwise stated, 

and the reporting scope covers:

 

Resorts World Sentosa: An integrated  

 

resort destination located on Sentosa island  

 

District Cooling Plant: Our award-winning  

 

cooling plant that supplies chilled water for  

 

the resort 

 

Genting Hotel Jurong: A ‘hotel in a  

 

garden’ in the Jurong Lake District 

 

Genting Centre: Corporate office of the  

 

Genting Singapore Group 

 

Pandan Garden: A warehouse located in  

 

Pandan Gardens

In 2021, we began disclosing our climate change 

impacts through the world’s leading environmental 

disclosure platform, the CDP platform. We also 

started implementing recommendations from 

the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 

Disclosures (TCFD) to enhance our assessment 

and disclosure of climate-related risks and 

opportunities. We will continue to report relevant 

progress in subsequent sustainability reports.

We welcome feedback to 

continually improve our sustainability 

reporting and practices.

MESSAGE FROM OUR PRESIDENT



Globally, COVID-19 has brought about unprecedented 

and adverse impact to the travel and tourism industry. 

Whilst it created massive disruptions to people and 

businesses around the world, it also raised awareness of 

the importance of Environment, Social and Governance 

(ESG) matters and created a strong urgency to tackle 

environmental, social and public health issues. This 

year, as the world starts to slowly pivot to recovery, 

and reopen economies and borders, it remains clear 

that international travel is unlikely to resume to pre-

pandemic levels any time soon.

ESG Integration and Recognition 

Amidst the unprecedented and protracted disruptions, 

GENS’ early adoption and integration of ESG best practices 

served as a strong foundation for us to adapt and emerge 

stronger on solid foundation on ethical grounds, and also 

because the travelers of tomorrow will demand it. 

Our journey towards a sustainable premium lifestyle 

destination resort and strong continued efforts in 2021 

received multiple affirmations. Amongst the distinguished 

certifications and accolades we received, we are proud 

to be the first destination in the world to be certified to 

both the (GSTC) Global Sustainable Tourism Council’s 

Destination Criteria and the GSTC Industry Criteria for 

Hotels.  At the national level, we are honoured to receive 

the Special Award for Sustainability and the Special Award 

for Community Care (Business) at the Singapore Tourism 

Awards 2021, which recognise businesses leading the 

charge in implementing sustainable tourism solutions and 

displaying exceptional care towards the community during 

COVID-19. In recognition of our consistent achievement 

and performance in packaging waste reduction, we took 

home the Top Achievement Award (MNC) for the third 

consecutive year at the Singapore Packaging Agreement 

Award ceremony held in March 2021. These serve as 

compelling testimony of our holistic and systematic 

approach to sustainability and our commitment to making 

continuous improvement in our businesses. 

Creating Sustainable Value for All 

The focus of our sustainability strategy has always 

been to create value for all stakeholders, not just for 

our customers but also our employees, shareholders 

and the broader community and supply chain. We rose 

to the challenge and fulfilled the requirements. GENS 

was named to the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index 

which tracks the performance of public companies 

committed to supporting gender equality through policy 

development, representation and transparency. RWS 

bagged two awards at the 2021 Chartered Institute 

of Procurement and Supply (CIPS) Asia Excellence 

in Procurement Awards ceremony for Community 

Response and Overall Winner in recognition of our 

exemplary supply chain management during COVID-19. 

We remain committed to providing investors with 

relevant ESG information and completed our ESG and 

TCFD disclosure ahead of SGX requirement via the CDP 

platform. Giving back to the community is one of GENS’ 

core tenets. We stepped forward once again as the 

Managing Agent of the Community Treatment Facility at 

the NTUC Health Nursing Home in Tampines to oversee 

a capacity of about 250 beds with more than 120 RWS 

team members volunteering to care for vulnerable 

COVID-19 patients.

Emerging Stronger through 

Partnership and Collaboration

Embracing sustainability requires collective effort 

and we actively engage like-minded partners to 

build a larger sustainability ecosystem. In a landmark 

development for the industry, RWS joined hands with 

Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) as one 

of the 17 founding members to form the Sentosa 

Carbon Neutral Network (SCNN), Singapore’s first 

carbon neutrality-focused business alliance. This is 

a collective public-private effort to achieve carbon 

neutrality by 2030 and to transform Sentosa into 

a sustainable tourism destination. To strengthen 

our longstanding commitment to biodiversity and 

environmental protection, we launched the RWS-NUS 

Living Laboratory. The S$10 million applied research 

collaboration is the single largest academic-industry 

collaboration with direct contribution to tourism 

economy and environmental education and aims to 

enhance biodiversity conservation and develop critical 

decarbonisation and integrative nature-based solutions 

to address real world issues.

Charting Our Journey to 2030 

Against the backdrop of the new normal brought 

about by the pandemic and escalating climate change 

concerns, we refreshed our sustainability framework 

to reflect pressing ESG issues, our latest stakeholders’ 

engagement and materiality assessment. To reinforce 

our vision to be a global leader in sustainable tourism, 

we launched the “RWS Full Circle” framework and 

developed “2030 Sustainability Master Plan”. This is 

a strategic blueprint that outlines our ambitious goals 

and represents the next leap in our journey to align our 

business with low carbon and circular economy, create 

positive socio-economic impact and to better serve 

current and future generations. 

Solving the world’s sustainability challenges require the 

collaborative and collective efforts of the public-private-

people sectors. How we emerge from this challenging 

period will determine our performance over the coming 

years. We are quietly confident that our all-inclusive 

sustainability strategy, with comprehensive planning and 

execution, will enable us to navigate an unpredictable 

COVID-19 situation and emerge stronger. 

Finally, I wish to thank all our stakeholders, especially 

our team members, our Singapore Government, 

partners and shareholders for their unstinting advice 

and unwavering support in navigating this crisis and also 

in our sustainability journey. We will continue to pursue 

best in class sustainability practices as Asia’s leading 

leisure and tourism destination for the sake of our 

generations to come.

Sustainability Report 2021 provides a transparent 

account of Genting Singapore’s ESG performance 

over the past year. It also communicates the 

company’s bold vision to drive sustainable tourism 

through the newly-launched RWS Full Circle 

framework and the goals set out in our 2030 

Sustainability Master Plan. 

As part of its responsibilities, the Board maintains its 

oversight of the Sustainability Working Committee 

and Sustainability Steering Committee, to ensure 

the continued relevance of Genting Singapore’s 

sustainability strategy and efforts. 

Underpinning Genting Singapore’s approach 

to sustainability is the company’s Sustainability 

Framework. The framework informs the company’s 

management approach in developing policies and 

practices, as well as setting performance targets 

and action plans to drive sustainable value creation. 

In 2021, the Sustainability Framework was updated 

following a materiality assessment, which included 

a review of changing global and local trends, 

regulatory developments, and stakeholder interests. 

The Board continues to consider the identified 

material ESG topics as part of its strategic decision 

making and oversees the management and 

monitoring of the company’s performance against 

its material ESG topics. 

As we continue to deal with the disruption caused 

by the global COVID-19 pandemic, Genting 

Singapore remains committed to driving continuous 

improvement on its sustainability journey and 

delivering on its vision of being global leader in 

sustainable tourism.

SUSTAINABILITY 

GOVERNANCE

Genting Singapore’s sustainability strategy and agenda is led by the Board of Directors, which is supported by 

the Sustainability Steering Committee, Sustainability Working Committee and Sustainability Department. This 

sustainability governance structure involving the highest governance level in Genting Singapore allows us to set 

strategic sustainability direction and keep track of our progress against goals. 

Board of Directors

Sustainability Department 

GENS President &amp; COO and RWS Chairman &amp; CEO

Sustainability Working Committee

Sustainability Steering Committee

The Board maintains oversight over Genting Singapore’s sustainability strategy and programmes, 

ensuring the continued consideration of relevant ESG topics in our operations, in addition to current global 

dynamics, local trends, and emerging regulatory developments. 

The Sustainability Department was established in 2021 to drive sustainability efforts across Genting 

Singapore’s operations, working closely with the respective businesses. The Department is led by the Vice 

President (VP), Sustainability, who reports directly to the RWS Chairman &amp; CEO on sustainability initiatives.

The GENS President &amp; COO, who is also the RWS Chairman &amp; CEO, is responsible for the organisation’s 

sustainability strategy, evaluates relevant ESG issues and opportunities, oversees execution of corporate 

and business sustainability policy, strategy and goals. 

The Working Committee supports the Steering Committee and meets regularly to drive the integration of 

sustainability in their respective business units. It comprises 25 representatives from various business units 

including but not limited to Human Resources (HR), Finance, Legal, Business Intelligence, Operations and  

Facility Management. 

The Steering Committee oversees and drives ESG practices across the company, guided by our sustainability 

strategy. The Committee meets monthly to initiate, run and monitor practices and initiatives in order to support 

the effective integration of sound ESG practices into our business operations and corporate objectives.

MATERIALITY 

ASSESSMENT

To identify the most important ESG topics for our business, the Sustainability Steering Committee and 

Sustainability Working Group conduct a materiality assessment once every three years. This allows us to stay 

abreast of the global and local trends that shape our sustainability context. In 2021, we engaged an external 

consultant and performed a review to update our material ESG topics. These topics formed the basis for 

updating our approach to managing sustainability and developing our new Sustainability Framework, as well as 

our 2030 Sustainability Master Plan.

Our Response

Sustainable Tourism

With the heightened awareness on climate change in recent years, sustainable tourism is 

quickly gaining grounds among travelers around the globe. Business clients and leisure travelers 

are showing preferences over meaningful travel experiences that will leave behind positive 

environmental and socio-economic impacts. Given the increase in consumer demand and market 

attention on sustainable tourism, it is therefore material for GENS to stay ahead of the business 

transition to enhance our corporate branding and attractiveness to customers and investors. 

We have increasingly applied relevant industry best practices and global standards in our 

business planning and operations to achieve our vision of being the global leader in sustainable 

tourism. In 2021, we became the first destination in the world to be certified against both GSTC 

Destination Criteria and GSTC Industry Criteria for Hotels. Our SACEOS-certified MICE venues 

now come with the Eco-MICE package, providing our clients with the option to hold events at 

our venues with the best green practices. To stay current with the preferences of our guests, 

we have begun gathering sustainability feedback among our guests. As a result, despite the 

setback from strict implementation of SMMs, which may result in “less-than-expected” guest 

experiences, we continue to attain an average guest satisfaction score of 88.5%. Read more in 

Sustainable Tourism.

Wellbeing

Better wellbeing is often linked to higher satisfaction and engagement levels among team 

members, which translates into increased workplace productivity. Wellbeing of team members, 

which encompasses both mental and physical health, is critical to the success of a company, 

especially during the pandemic where the way we work and live has been disrupted. It is 

imperative now, more than ever, for GENS to place a stronger emphasis on our team members’ 

wellbeing. 

In GENS, we adopt a two-pronged approach to care for our team members’ overall wellbeing. 

In 2021, to promote mental wellbeing, we formalised a TM Wellbeing support network with Care 

Pals and Care Ambassadors trained in Psychological First Aid and First Aid in Mental Health. For 

team members who require professional assistance, we also offer counseling service through our 

Employee Assistance Programme. In terms of physical wellbeing, we offer complimentary, annual 

basic health screening programme. We also partner with the Health Promotion Board to organise 

monthly lunch talk sessions focusing on health and wellbeing. Find out more in Wellbeing.

Energy and Emissions

Climate change is affecting the world in many different aspects - from rising sea-levels to loss 

of biodiversity and lives. The disruption will only worsen if the human society continues to turn 

a blind eye towards the actions required to limit the pace of global warming. In GENS, we are 

conscious of the substantial energy consumption required to operate an integrated resort. We 

underscore measures needed to reduce our energy consumption and carbon emissions, and are 

working towards achieving carbon neutrality by 2030.  

This year, we conducted a carbon profiling exercise with an external consultant, providing us the 

opportunity to reflect on our energy consumption and carbon emissions across the years, and 

serving as the foundation for us to outline our decarbonisation goals in the upcoming decade. 

Today, 74% of our buildings by GFA are BCA Green Mark certified and 100% of our directly managed 

limousines have been converted into hybrid vehicles. We launched the RWS-NUS Living Laboratory 

to drive a more climate resilient business and will continue to explore potential institute-industry 

research and collaboration on sustainability. For more information, visit Care for Our Planet 

Sustainability Education and 

Advocacy 

Globally, there has been a growing attention on climate change and sustainability issues. An 

integrated resort welcoming millions of global visitors annually, we play a critical role in raising 

awareness on sustainability issues. Through sustainability education, outreach and engagement, 

we hope to empower our audience of all ages with the knowledge and values to contribute 

towards the international and national ESG agenda. 

To effectively drive our sustainability education and advocacy, we have identified five key target 

audience - guests, team members, suppliers, tenants, community, schools and institutions. We 

continuously partner with government bodies, NGOs and schools to drive behavioural change 

via immersive outreach activities. RWS co-organised the Tourism Innovation Competition x 

Sustainable Sentosa Ideathon 2021 with SDC and Temasek Polytechnic to nurture the next 

generation of sustainability champions. We implemented the Recommended Green Lease 

Guidelines for our tenants and encouraged a greener supply chain through our Supplier Code 

of Conduct. Internally, we expanded RWS Academy to include sustainability modules for team 

members. Find out more in Sustainability Education and Advocacy.   

Stakeholder Interest

Our stakeholders are important to the functioning of our business and play a role in making sure 

we are maintaining our social license to operate. Good stakeholder management will allow us to 

keep abreast of the industry trend and align expectations and interests. Considering that GENS 

is venturing into various ambitious sustainability agenda, it is important to have our stakeholders’ 

support since the beginning of the projects. 

We engage our stakeholders via various engagement channels to understand their interests 

and concerns. To further enhance our stakeholder confidence, we improved the transparency in 

our disclosure by voluntarily disclosing according to the TCFD recommendations, ahead of local 

regulatory requirements. Our TCFD disclosure outlines the Company’s sustainability governance, 

strategy, risk management and metric and targets. Read more in Stakeholder Interest

More than ever, the global 

community is relying on both 

the public and private sectors to 

lead the way in tackling climate 

change. Energy use accounts 

for a significant portion of 

global GHG emissions, primarily 

through combustion of fossil 

fuels. With Singapore warming 

up twice as fast as rest of 

the world, climate change 

is an existential challenge 

for Singapore. At Genting 

Singapore, we recognise the 

threat of climate change and  

its effect on the planet  

and livelihoods, and are  

committed to do our part to 

drive decarbonisation and  

energy efficiency across  

our operations.

OUR APPROACH

2021 marks the end of RWS Sustainability21, 

which was a five-year sustainability plan. Against 

the backdrop of the new normal brought about 

by the pandemic and escalating climate change 

concerns, it was opportune for GENS to revisit our 

sustainability framework and establish long term 

targets to support our sustainability vision and 

priorities. We engaged an external consultant to 

conduct carbon profiling and verification. Through 

this exercise, we established our Scope 1, 2 and 

3 carbon emissions in our own operations, and in 

our wider upstream and downstream value chain.

As electricity constitutes a significant proportion of 

our total carbon emissions, we adopted a holistic 

approach to drive Scope 2 emission reduction:

 

Collaboration and partnership: 

 

We partner with key stakeholders  

 

(e.g. Government, institutions) to explore and  

 

implement sustainability initiatives and solutions  

 

to create greater collective impact.

 

 

Accelerate renewable  

 energy solutions: 

 

As a leader in sustainable integrated resort  

 

development, we commit to increase our  

 

adoption of renewable energy by expanding  

 

the current solar capacity across the resort,  

 

including within the upcoming RWS 2.0  

 

expansion plans and to explore alternative low  

 

carbon sources.

 

 

 

Drive energy efficiency and 

 usage reduction: 

 

We plan to reduce energy consumption  

 

through equipment upgrades, process  

 

improvements and the implementation of new  

 

energy efficient technologies.

ENERGY AND EMISSIONS

OUR PERFORMANCE

 

Greening of infrastructure  

 and transport: 

 

We aim to integrate sustainability principles and  

 

innovation into building and facilities design,  

 

and to increase adoption of Electric Vehicles  

 

(EV) to meet RWS sustainability goal of  

 

utilising 100% Electric Vehicles by 2030.

Mr Tan Hee Teck, Chief Executive Officer,  

RWS

RWS-NUS Living Laboratory on 

Decarbonisation and Nature- 

based Solutions

In January 2022, we announced a five-year 

applied research partnership with National 

University of Singapore (NUS) to set up the RWS-

NUS Living Laboratory. We have committed S$10 

million in funding to support this, marking the 

single largest academic-industry partnership that 

will contribute directly to the tourism economy, 

environmental education and sustainability efforts 

in Singapore. The research will be focused on two 

broad areas: 

 

Biodiversity conservation and education 

 

Decarbonisation and nature-based solutions 

The decarbonisation and nature-based solutions 

research will focus on environmental, climate 

change-related and urban challenges across 

multiple domains including energy, water, waste – 

which are of strategic relevance to our business, 

as well as important areas of research to position 

Singapore as a sustainable tourism destination. 

Development and test-bedding will be conducted 

at RWS properties and the research aims to 

eventually adapt and scale solutions across a 

variety of environments and properties.

Research topics include: 

 

Integrative nature-based energy  

 

efficient solutions

 

The research will facilitate the understanding,  

 

design, and implementation of infrastructure  

 

and sustainability solutions by innovating and  

 

operationalising integrative nature-based  

 

energy efficient solutions coupled with internet  

 

of things (IOT) based climatic sensors/ devices,  

 

data mining, and systems modelling capabilities.

 

Decarbonisation

 

The research will take a multi-disciplinary 

 

approach to augment and accelerate  

 

decarbonisation by harnessing next-generation  

 

technology designed and optimised for  

 

tropical, urban settings, such as low energy  

 

systems and resource efficient solutions. 

Read more about the Living Lab’s biodiversity 

focus on page 28.  

Accelerate Renewable  

Energy Solutions 

The adoption of renewable energy is integral 

to our decarbonisation strategy and roadmap. 

In 2021, our solar photovoltaic (PV) system 

of 500kWp at Universal Studios Singapore, 

generated approximately 615,732kWh of energy, 

which is sufficient to power about 136 four-room 

HDB flats for a year. This was the single, largest 

solar PV system in Singapore when it was  

first installed.  

To further accelerate the adoption of renewable 

energy, we completed an exercise to identify 

possible rooftop spaces for additional solar 

panel installations and are currently conducting a 

feasibility study, with an aim to quadruple current 

capacity. This study includes new buildings in the 

upcoming RWS 2.0 expansion.  

Aside from solar energy, we are also assessing the 

possibility of other clean energy sources, such as 

utlising waste-to-energy technologies.  

HIGHLIGHTS 

Founding Member of the 

Sentosa Carbon Neutral 

Network 

In a landmark development for the industry, 

we partnered with SDC as one of the 17 

founding members to form the SCNN, 

Singapore’s first carbon neutrality-focused 

business alliance. This is a public-private 

effort to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 

and to transform Sentosa into a sustainable 

tourism destination. Collectively the network 

accounts for more than 90% of the island’s 

estimated carbon profile and members are 

working together on:

• Development of green MICE offerings,  

 

guidelines for reducing disposables and  

 

local food sourcing

• Sentosa-wide sustainability solutions  

 

through the sharing of resources and  

 

expertise, leveraging economies of scale  

 

to introduce large-scale solutions







Solar photovoltaic system at RWS

Drive Energy Efficiency and  

Usage Reduction

Our award-winning district cooling plant is 

critical to our electricity and water management. 

It functions at benchmark Coefficient of 

Performance (COP) with advanced controllers that 

run on customised algorithms, which automatically 

control multiple, complex operational parameters 

of the chillers, pumps, cooling towers, and heat 

exchangers for optimal efficiency. 

In 2021, we completed plans to upgrade the 

chillers by 2025. Upon completion of upgrade, the 

chillers will attain a plant efficiency of 0.65 kW/RT, 

in line with requirements of the BCA Green Mark 

Platinum certification, and will be an improvement 

from current chiller performance of about  

0.70kW/RT.

Greening Transportation Infrastructure

In line with the Singapore Green Plan and SDC’s 

strategic roadmap to electrify transportation and 

increase electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, 

we are working towards utilising 100% EVs by 

2030. In 2021, we started to replace our rented 

limousines with hybrid vehicles and are exploring 

to convert shuttle buses and limousines to EVs 

when contracts are due for renewal.





EV charging stations at RWS

In 2021, we installed one additional unit of EV 

charger over and above the current baseline of 

having nine EV fast chargers, with four allocated 

for EV car sharing programmes such as Blue 

SG. We continue to monitor utilisation of the EV 

chargers and have plans to quadruple the total 

number of EV charging stations at RWS by 2030 

to cater for the expected increase in EV usage  

in Singapore.  

 





District cooling plant at RWS

Based on established thermal environments 

standards for design, operation, and 

commissioning of buildings and other occupied 

spaces, we designed and built 16 HVLS (High 

Volume Low Speed) fans in our hotels, S.E.A. 

Aquarium and common spaces to reduce reliance 

on air-conditioning. By optimising environmental 

factors of temperature, thermal radiation, 

humidity, and air speed, we were able to raise 

the air-conditioning temperature to 27oC while 

maintaining the same level of cooling effect and 

thermal comfort, resulting in energy savings of up 

to 30% (estimated at 100,000kWh per year, at 

pre-COVID levels). Phase 2 of the project will see 

the installation of additional 16 HVLS fans across 

the rest of resort, which includes the RWCC  

and Universal Studios Singapore. 

We have also installed canopies and nettings 

to reduce the need to chill water at the S.E.A. 

Aquarium. For instance, such canopies were 

installed at Dolphin Island to reduce direct sun 

exposure on the dolphin pool, and nettings 

were installed above our foam fractionators at 

S.E.A. Aquarium. These canopies and nettings 

are expected to achieve a 0.5oC drop in water 

temperature, resulting in energy savings.  

Efficient Heating and Cooling  

Since inception, our buildings and infrastructure 

have integrated natural daylight features to 

reduce energy consumption. Since then, with 

higher levels of electricity demand needed to 

support our expanding business operations, 

we have made it our priority to source for and 

implement energy efficient fittings and fixtures. 

Today, we are proud to announce that we have 

100% LED lighting installed across the resort. 

Better in performance, LEDs are able to produce 

lighting with higher efficiency and has a  

longer lifespan.

We have also started installing motion sensors for 

lighting in phases, to reduce electricity wastage. 

Our Facilities Management and Engineering 

(FM&amp;E) team has ensured that non-essential lights 

are turned off and selective lights are dimmed 

outside of main operating hours to optimise our 

energy consumption.

Our escalators are fitted with variable speed drive 

(VSD) systems to reduce energy consumption by 

decelerating when no passengers are detected. 

This energy efficient feature also improves the 

useful life of the escalators in RWS. 

We optimise our heat exchange pump control 

system with higher efficiency heat pumps which 

not only consume less energy to produce hot 

water, but generates cooling energy for cooling 

applications as a by-product. These heat pumps 

work by absorbing the surrounding hot air and 

can save more than twice the energy required by 

standard heat pumps, resulting in overall savings 

of about 60kWh per day.

Water is at the core of 

sustainable development and 

is critical for socio-economic 

development. Demand and 

competition for water are 

expected to increase with 

global climate change and 

population growth, putting 

more pressure on water 

supplies. This issue is further 

amplified in Singapore where 

resources are limited. It is 

therefore crucial for businesses 

like ours to develop sustainable, 

integrated and holistic water 

management.

WATER AND EFFLUENTS 

OUR APPROACH

Genting Singapore recognises the possible water 

risks faced by businesses in Singapore, and 

highly value the limited water resources available. 

Water-related risks is one of the key climate 

risks identified and reviewed by the Sustainability 

Steering Committee with direct oversight by the 

Board of Directors.  

We adopt a holistic approach to drive sustainable, 

integrated and holistic water management. 

Diversified sources of water supply: We draw from four diversified sources for our water 

supply and actively source for new opportunities in alternative water sources, and explore technologies in 

water conservation to reduce and reuse water where applicable

Drive water efficiency 

and usage reduction: We 

plan to reduce energy consumption 

through equipment upgrades, process 

improvements and implementation of new 

energy efficient technologies 

Collaboration and 

partnership: We will work with key 

stakeholders such as the Government 

and institutions to explore and implement 

sustainability initiatives and solutions to 

create greater collective impact

HIGHLIGHTS

Modifying swimming pool 

balancing tank level controls 

Our FM&amp;E team constantly explores 

opportunities to enhance water efficiency. 

In 2021, the team adjusted swimming 

pool balancing tanks levels to allow the 

harvesting of rainwater, which would 

normally have overflowed. This allows us to 

more efficiently use rainwater to fill the pool 

rather than drawing down from city water.



City Water

We use city water across 

our hospitality and 

entertainment venues, 

via water efficient taps, 

showers and systems

Reclaimed Water 

We deploy a water 

reclamation system for 

the District Cooling Plant 

(DCP) to recycle and 

reuse the cooling tower 

blow-down water and 

surface run-off water, 

reducing freshwater 

intake by almost 7%

Harvested Rainwater 

We harvest rainwater 

for swimming pools and 

irrigation purposes

OUR PERFORMANCE

In 2021, we implemented various water saving 

initiatives to enhance water efficiency and reduce 

water consumption. 

Diversified Sources of  

Water Supply 

Our primary source of water is freshwater from 

Singapore’s municipal water source, the Public 

Utilities Board (PUB). This is supplemented by 

reclaimed water from our water reclamation 

system which recycles and reuses the cooling 

tower blow-down water from our DCP and uses 

surface run-off water, thereby reducing freshwater 

intake by almost 7%. In addition we use harvested 

rainwater for our pools and irrigation purposes 

and draw seawater from Keppel Harbour to create 

a life support system for our aquatic organisms. 

Used seawater is discharged back to Keppel 

Harbour as backwash after it goes through our 

sand filters. Water discharged is compliant with 

the watercourse limits set by Singapore’s National 

Environment Agency (NEA). We manage this 

discharge by sampling every two months and 

monitor our freshwater systems with the advice of 

an independent accredited laboratory. Our water 

management system at the S.E.A.A. aligns with 

the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ (AZA) 

guidelines on water discharge and recycling. The 

AZA sets the leading standards of excellence for 

zoo and aquarium management around the world.

Our consistent water conservation efforts have 

also led to our certification by PUB as a Water 

Efficient Building (Basic).

Details on our water consumption can be found in 

page 63.

Continuous Water Efficiency 

Improvement  

We monitor water consumption through our 

Integrated Utilities Monitoring System, and 

conduct monthly meetings to identify new 

opportunities to conserve water. Our efforts 

have resulted in a total of 65% water savings 

cumulatively since 2015, well exceeding the target 

we had set for ourselves in 2015. 

We aim to install more sub-water meters at 

various locations to improve our monitoring 

capabilities, which enable efforts to eliminate 

wastage and allow for early response to issues.

Shutdown of Non-essential Water Features 

during Pandemic 

The pandemic continued to affect business 

operations in 2021. In view of the lower frequency 

of visitors to the resort, the FM&amp;E team made 

the decision to shut down non-essential water 

features to reduce water wastage after a 

feasibility assessment.

Seawater Flowmeters

We invested in seawater flowmeters to track 

consumption and monitor leakage levels from 

sand filters and foam fractionators processes. This 

reduces unnecessary seawater losses and chilled 

water consumption.



Progressive Replacement of Water  

Efficient Taps 

We are in the midst of progressively replacing our 

water features with faucets that have lower flow 

rates, specifically aligning to the 3-tick rating under 

PUB’s Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme (WELS). 

Water Conservation and Advocacy 

We collaborated with Singapore’s national 

water agency PUB, to raise awareness on water 

conservation by supporting the City Turns Blue 

initiative held during Singapore World Water Day 

(SWWD) in 2021. Our buildings were lit in blue on 

this day to symbolise our commitment  

towards sustainability.

WASTE

WASTE

Today, most of the economy 

operates on a linear “take-

make-waste” model, which 

is increasing the amount of 

global waste being generated, 

especially when societies 

emerge from poverty and 

begin to consume and build 

more. Businesses are primarily 

responsible for the design and 

production of goods that could 

ultimately end up as waste. We 

too have a part to play, as one 

of the major tourist destinations 

in Asia-Pacific. 

OUR APPROACH

We are committed to support Singapore’s Zero 

Waste Masterplan. One of our 2030 RWS Master 

Plan targets is to achieve a 50% reduction in 

waste to landfill by 2030. To achieve that, we 

continuously review our waste management 

strategies, including to adopt:  

 

A circular economy approach to  

 

waste and resource management practices,  

 

making a deliberate shift towards more  

 

sustainable production and consumption 

 

 A waste management hierarchy 

 

which serves as the basis for developing our  

 

waste management strategies, firstly focusing  

 

on what waste we can avoid, increasing  

 

the amount we reuse and recycle, followed by  

 

material and energy recovery, and as a last  

 

resort, sending waste to landfill. 

HIGHLIGHTS



Joining the collective national effort to work towards zero waste, and to reduce our ecological 

footprint, we participated in the waste stream profiling exercise coordinated by SDC in 2021. This 

exercise aims to better comprehend the general waste profile for all SCNN members and to appraise 

the feasibility of implementing a precinct-level waste-to-energy solution. 

In 2021, we successfully diverted 21.44% of waste from landfill.1 To achieve our 2030 target, we continue 

to reduce waste generation, expand on our recycling programmes, which include encouraging F&amp;B 

tenants to recycle more food waste, and also source for new innovations in recycling.

OUR PERFORMANCE

Food Waste Reduction  

We implemented three food grinder stations. 

These machines automatically grind food waste 

to pulp, which is then transported to a bio-

digester that converts 95% of the food waste 

it receives into liquid, further reducing waste 

volume. As a result, we are able to reduce food 

waste by approximately 90 tonnes per year and 

reduce plastic trash bags consumption by 72,000 

bags per year. Moving forward, due to space 

constraints, we are exploring off-site precinct 

level solutions and waste recovery innovations 

to further drive circularity, closing the waste loop 

system so as to reduce waste to landfill.

Plastic Waste Reduction 

We are committed to reducing plastic 

consumption across all our programmes. In 2021, 

we further built on our existing efforts, achieving 

the following: 

  Introduced filtered water dispensers as an  

  alternative in specialty restaurants and hotel  

  F&amp;B outlets to reduce dependence on  

  bottled water

  Introduced biodegradable cling film for all  

  food preparation  

Other ongoing efforts include promoting reduced 

plastic consumption and waste generation at our 

establishments. For example, Malaysian Food 

Street campaigned a B.Y.O. initiative, offering 

discounts on all food and drinks for guests who 

opt to use their own takeaway containers. We also 

stopped providing plastic straws in all RWS-owned 

F&amp;B outlets, and only provide paper straws  

upon request. 

Eco-friendly Packaging

Festive gifts contribute significantly to packaging 

waste. We proactively manage that by designing 

our festive gifts with more sustainable packaging, 

such as sourcing for paper that was certified by 

the Forest Stewardship Council, instead of using 

plastic or metal. We apply this across our products 

including carriers and festive gifts such as during 

the Dragon Boat and Mid-Autumn Festivals. This 

has been met with positive feedback from both 

local and international communities.

Reusable Alternatives

RWS has initiated phased reduction and 

elimination of single-use plastic tableware like 

sauce dishes, plastic cups and plastic takeaway 

bowls. We ceased provision of plastic water 

bottles in our hotel rooms and replaced them 

with reusable carafes and water dispensers are 

installed throughout the hotels for guests to refill 

water using their carafes. We have also replaced 

disposable sauce dishes and plastic drinking cups 

with reusable melamine wares at our Malaysian 

Food Street food court. The switch to melamine 

wares has amounted to a reduction of 0.09 tonne 

of packaging material and 0.44 tonne of plastic 

used per year. Reusable or other sustainable 

alternatives have been offered in place of plastic 

options, saving approximately 130 tonnes of 

plastic per year. Note : Initiatives above are 

reviewed periodically and adjusted accordingly to 

align with prevailing COVID-19 Safe Management 

Measures.

Sustainable Event Venue

RWS launched its Eco-MICE package in 2021 to 

meet increasing demand for sustainable events. 

Its green initiatives include providing our guests  

with eco pens, recycled paper and meals served 

in eco-friendly packaging. Eco packaging creates 

the same amount of waste - unless the packaging 

itself is reusable and not disposed. To reduce food 

waste, unserved food will also be donated to the 

Food Bank, while the remaining food waste will be 

sent to the food waste digesters. Furthermore, all 

MICE venues at RWS have been retrofitted with 

energy-efficient LED lighting and motion-activated 

lighting in washrooms, with plans to upgrade air 

conditioning chillers to improve efficiency. 

Recycling Programmes and 

Initiatives

RWS currently recycles 10 waste streams (i.e. 

paper/cardboard, plastic, glass, metal cans, food 

waste, cooking oil, electronic waste (e-waste), 

linen waste, wood pallets and spent coffee/

horticulture). In 2021, we achieved a waste 

diversion rate of 21.44%1, a slight increase from 

2020 due to the evolving waste profile under the 

protracted COVID-19 operational measures.

 

Given the upcoming RWS 2.0 expansion plans, 

we recognise the importance of accounting 

for construction waste and are committed 

to effectively manage waste generated, and 

incorporate them into RWS overall waste 

management strategy and waste intensity 

reduction performance indicators. In 2021, we 

recycled over 75% of the total construction waste 

generated.  

E-waste Management 

We encourage the public to manage their 

waste more sustainably. To that end, we have 

collaborated with NEA to install an e-waste 

receptacle for public use and have successfully 

collected 8.1 tonnes of e-waste for 2021.

Partnership and Collaboration 

RWS actively engages local government agencies 

and organisations to explore recycling initiatives 

and minimise carbon emissions, such as with the 

NEA and SDC.

10% off when they bring their own containers for 

takeaways at Malaysian Food Street.  

“RWS was awarded the Top 

Achievement Award for the third

implemented many packaging 

waste reduction initiatives, such as 

replacing their disposable sauce 

dishes and plastic drinking cups with 

reusable melamine ones at their

Globally, the building sector 

accounts for about 40% 

all energy-related carbon 

emissions. Climate change 

cannot be addressed without 

putting the built environment at 

the centre of the conversation. 

In particular, climate change 

is an existential challenge for 

Singapore. Adapting new 

builds and upgrading existing 

buildings with the use of 

the right design and green 

technologies is necessary 

to respond to these new 

drivers and achieve significant 

decarbonisation for the sector. 

SUSTAINABLE BUILDING DESIGN  

AND FACILITIES 

OUR APPROACH

In response to broad concerns regarding the 

environment and climate change, green buildings 

and effective cooling are central to our building 

and facilities design – this applies not only to 

our current operations but also our future RWS 

2.0 expansion plans in order to future proof our 

development. The business case for sustainable 

OUR PERFORMANCE

Partnership and Collaboration 

As a world class integrated resort offering a blend 

of indoor and outdoor experiences, we seek to 

provide a comfortable environment for our guests. 

Singapore is hot and humid for much of the year 

and this is exacerbated by the Urban Heat Island 

(UHI) effect. Given a choice, guests prefer to 

stay in air-conditioned spaces, a behaviour which 

runs counter to the Intergovernmental Panel on 

Climate Change’s (IPCC) recommendation for 

air-conditioning to be used only when and where 

necessary. 

In order to achieve comfortable conditions 

for our guests, the climatic conditions they 

experience need to be modified. However, this 

generally requires more energy consumption 

and poses a challenge to balance our needs with 

our responsibility to the natural environment. 

To address this, we are testing and developing 

environmentally friendly technologies and nature-

based design as cooling solutions. We will explore 

and develop strategies to cool urban spaces, test-

bedd at RWS properties, and adapt for scalability 

across a variety of environments and premises. 

Greening Building and Facilities 

Since RWS was first built, we have incorporated 

sustainability into our building and infrastructure 

designs. Features adopted in the early days 

included the DCP, solar panels, rainwater 

harvesting, green roofs and many more, enabling 

our attainment of multiple BCA Green Mark 

certifications even prior to our official opening. 

These certifications are important external 

validation that we have incorporated key 

environmental aspects into our building and  

facility designs. 

Since then, Genting Singapore has been awarded 

more Green Mark certifications for its hotels and 

infrastructure, achieving a total of 13 Green Mark 

certifications, including for Genting Hotel Jurong 

(GHJ), further affirming Genting Singapore’s 

sustainability commitment and goals.

building and facilities design has never been 

clearer, even though the specifics of how to 

achieve higher levels of sustainability are evolving.  

While it poses a challenge to our business, it also 

presents opportunities to develop new solutions, 

especially in the area of energy efficiency. 

We approach this through  

 

Partnership and collaboration: 

 

We partner with like-minded organisations to  

 

develop innovative building and facilities  

 

solutions, and test bed them at RWS for  

 

scalability in future expansion settings 

 

 

 

Greening building and  

 facilities: We harness next generation  

 

technology, integrative nature-based design  

 

solutions across the domains of energy, water  

 

and waste 

 

Integrating sustainability  

 principles and innovation into our  

 RWS 2.0 Expansion: This is done at  

 

the design stage with the objective of minimising  

 

negative impacts to the environment  

We also engage external consultants to conduct 

Environmental Impact Studies (EIS) prior to our 

expansion and redevelopment. The objective of an 

EIS is to predict the level of impact caused by the 

expansion and redevelopment works, and assess 

the significance of this impact. We then implement 

mitigation, monitoring and management measures, 

where feasible, to reduce the level of  

environmental impact.

GENS BCA Green Mark Certification Journey

As one of Singapore’s leading integrated resorts, we strive to be at the forefront of sustainability and 

in 2021, we have committed to carbon neutrality by 2030. A decarbonisation roadmap was developed 

strategically to achieve this, and to integrate sustainability principles into our upcoming RWS 2.0 

expansion plans. We aim to increase our Green Mark certification levels to 75% of our GFA in our new 

build, and to review existing Green Mark certifications to maintain the level awarded, or where possible, 

increase to the next level. 

Integrate Sustainability Principles 

and Innovation into our Build for 

RWS 2.0 Expansion  

To create a building that has minimal impact 

to the environment and yet at the same time 

remaining practical, economical and comfortable 

requires a complex, integrative and holistic 

approach. RWS will adopt the new Singapore 

BCA Green Mark 2021 guidelines for our RWS 2.0 

expansion and integrate green building solutions 

that align with the United Nations’ Sustainable 

Development Goals (UNSDGs). Aside from building 

efficiency and maintainability, the new Green Mark 

guideline takes a holistic sustainability view that 

encompasses socio-economic elements and also 

takes reference from the European Union (EU) 

taxonomy and requirements within the TCFD, 

which aligns with RWS long term sustainability 

plans.

The RWS 2.0 expansion will take into 

consideration key aspects such as climate action, 

health and wellbeing, and resources and circularity 

during the design and construction phase, and 

incorporate the following elements:

 

Energy efficiency

 

Intelligence

 

Health and wellbeing

 

Whole of life carbon

 

Design for maintainability

 

Resilience

RWS is committed to incorporating sustainability 

principles and innovation into the RWS 2.0 

expansion plans to meet the following:

1. RWS 2.0 re-development targets to achieve  

 

BCA Green Mark Platinum, with parts of the  

 

development achieving Super Low Energy  

 

(SLE) building rating.

2. New buildings are targeted to achieve 30%  

 

higher energy efficiency levels than current  

 

buildings, or 50% higher energy efficiency  

 

levels from 2005 building design codes.

3. A new DCP to be installed with digital  

 

twin technology that helps to reduce energy  

 

consumption by 20% as compared to a typical  

 

cooling plant. 

4. The new DCP also targets to reduce water  

 

consumption by 30%, through collection and  

 

reuse of rainwater, condensate and gray water. 

5. The redevelopment plans and targets will add  

 

500kWp in output from the solar photovoltaic  

 

(PV) system, which is equivalent to the annual  

 

electricity consumption of approximately 150  

 

HDB 4-room flats. 

In terms of landscape, softscape and structural, 

RWS 2.0 will incorporate: 

1. Nature-based design, technology that drives  

 

energy efficiency, as well as low carbon  

 

sources and building products.

2. Digital thermal modelling to mitigate UHI  

 

effects and to develop a unique solution for  

 

outdoor thermal comfort.

Deepening relationships with 

our conservation partners 

Rising from the pandemic, ERC was able 

to deepen our relationship with existing 

conservation partners such as the Marine 

Stewardship Council (MSC) and James 

Cook University Singapore (JCUS).  We 

worked closely with JCUS on building 

a new foundation for research and 

conservation at the Aquarium that would 

support student researchers with an 

interest on Sharks and Rays. Despite the 

reduction of Aquarium operating hours and 

implementation of home-based learning, 

both partners found ways to support 

students throughout the year on their 

research of the Bowmouth Guitarfish, Sand 

Tiger Shark and Manta Ray. This effort 

supports building the base for  

future student research efforts on critically  

endangered animals. 

health of this natural ecosystem. As part of the larger 

Sentosa Island biodiversity system, our secondary 

coastal forest serves as a buffer for Mount Imbiah, 

one of the two nature areas on the island.

We also host 59 threatened plant species listed 

in the Singapore Red Data Book, including 

eight species which were previously extinct in 

Singapore.

We proactively upkeep the health of plants and 

trees on our premises, including the Heritage Tree 

– Garcinia hombroniana (Seashore Mangosteen). 

We adopt a least-chemical approach in 

landscaping maintenance to maintain good soil 

quality and clean groundwater. We use natural 

ingredients such as compost and used coffee 

grounds collected from our establishments and 

operations to ameliorate soil condition and serve 

as a mulch layer for plants. 

Protecting Marine Biodiversity at RWS 

At RWS, we prioritise animal welfare to the highest 

standards and are both reactive and proactive in 

ensuring that all animals are given the best  

care possible. 

Our programmes at the S.E.A. Aquarium are in line 

with global best practices maintained by the AZA, 

whose manuals are based on the latest science, 

practice, and technology to maximise capacity 

for excellence in animal care and welfare. We also 

regularly exchange best husbandry and welfare 

practices with other aquariums. 

In 2021, we were delighted to foster two 

successful new births of shark species recognised 

as ‘Endangered’ by the IUCN Red List - the zebra 

shark and Hasselt’s bamboo shark.

The successful births are testament to the 

excellence of our animal and husbandry practices. 

Our team of aquarists and animal health specialists 

regularly check on animal welfare. During routine 

dives, the aquarists can discover eggs or shark 

pups in hiding. Once found, the eggs or pups will 

be separated and placed in a dedicated back-of-

house set-up. The highest level of care is given 

 to the pup or hatchling to ensure we meet its 

physical, social, behavioural, and psychological 

needs.

Educating the Public on the Need 

for Conservation Action 

We develop programmes to raise awareness on 

the need for conversation action, reaching youths 

and families directly through our efforts and also 

integrating environmental conservation messages 

in education curriculum through our partnership 

with educators such as the Early Childhood 

Development Agency (ECDA). 

We also maintain a steady pool of ocean 

ambassadors who volunteer their time and 

passion to share stories and messages from our 

oceans to guests who visit the S.E.A. Aquarium. 

Our docents play a critical role as station 

interpreters at the Discovery Pool, engaging with 

guests of all ages and from all walks of life about 

marine biodiversity and conservation. 

We continued celebrating the wonders of our 

oceans and spreading the message on the critical 

need to protect them, and timed our content to 

build on the social media chatter around events 

such as World Environment Day, World Oceans 

Day and the International Coastal Cleanup effort. 

Critical issues such as unsustainable fishing and 

marine pollution were discussed along with 

recommended solutions on how we can contribute 

towards tackling these issues together. Tips on 

making responsible seafood choices, recycling, 

and taking part in conservation action such as 

beach cleanups were highlighted. 

With many families choosing to stay home 

during the June school holidays, we launched our 

inaugural virtual storytelling session to continue 

engaging young children. We also launched our 

Online Education Programme in March, reaching 

more than 2,000 students from ages 9 – 12 on 

marine biodiversity. Learning objectives were 

themed around understanding the characteristics 

of key marine species, their threats and global 

conservation efforts.

With the nation aiming for 

sustainability as one of the new 

engines of economic growth, 

it is now more than ever, an 

imperative for corporations 

to source responsibly, and 

champion ESG issues in the 

supply chain. 

To meet our 2030 carbon 

neutrality commitment 

and implement operational 

efficiencies, it is material for us 

to ensure responsible sourcing 

and an optimised supply chain.

RESPONSIBLE SOURCING 

AND SUPPLY CHAIN 

OUR APPROACH

Our responsible sourcing strategy is anchored on 

three focus areas: 

Focus Area 1: Reduce social and 

environmental impacts (sustainable 

sources)

 

Identify materials harvested with care for the  

 

longer-term health of the material source

 

Integrate circularity in sourcing  

 

Reduce environmental impact

We are committed to obtaining sustainable 

sources for our key material categories such as 

food and beverage, cleaning and transport.

Focus Area 2: Advocate and 

drive supply chain (supply chain 

influence)  

 

Incorporate sustainability considerations in the  

 

supply chain system 

 

Drive Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) 

We partner with suppliers who share the same 

sustainability values. We incorporate sustainability 

considerations in our requirement, selection, 

assessment and award decisions. We influence 

our supply chain towards sustainable business 

practices via joint supplier development projects 

for new innovative and sustainable solutions. All 

our suppliers must comply with our SCoC, which 

is issued as part of our Purchase Orders Standard 

Terms and Conditions. The SCoC sets out our 

expectations for Ethical Business Practice, Labour 

and Human Rights, Environmental Responsibility 

and Health and Safety. For example, we require a 

minimum BizSAFE 3, OHSAS 18001 or equivalent for 

all our suppliers performing high-risk work at RWS.

Focus Area 3: Enhance compliance 

and corporate governance (supply 

chain assurance)  

 

Drive certifications and compliance to support  

 

sustainable business 

 

Drive fair and transparent business practices 

We adopt fair and ethical tendering and supplier 

selection processes and abide by a rigorous set 

of criteria for evaluation of all potential suppliers 

including price, quality, track record, technical 

competency, financial stability, service support and 

sustainability initiatives. All business transactions 

are conducted electronically to ensure full 

compliance, governance, transparency and for an 

audit trail.   

CIPS Asia Excellence in 

Procurement Awards

In 2021, we were awarded Overall Winner and 

Best Community Response Project from CIPS 

Asia Excellence in Procurement which recognised 

our Procurement team’s efforts to support 

the community amidst the pandemic. The Best 

Community Response project relates specifically 

to our successful mobilisation of our supply chain 

within two days of appointment to operationalise 

Community Care Facilities (CCF) that housed 60% 

HIGHLIGHTS

of Singapore’s COVID-19 patients in 2020. This 

was recognised to be an impressive feat given 

the project involved 178 suppliers for a diverse 

range of categories including food and beverage, 

environmental services and IT infrastructure, 

happening at the onset of the pandemic with 

unprecedented supply chain restrictions. With the 

ramp-up, maintenance and ramp-down phases 

of the CCF each posing unique set of challenges, 

our procurement systems, processes and team 

members’ ability to adapt and adjust expeditiously 

was definitely imperative to its success.

OUR PERFORMANCE

There is no significant change to GENS and our 

supply chain in 2021. We maintained the industry 

procurement practices despite challenges from 

the pandemic, especially in the labour market 

due to border restrictions and shifting short-term 

demands. To ensure adequate supply of human 

capital, we kept a weather eye on the outsourced 

contracts and engaged our stakeholders diligently 

via dialogues and discussions. 

We engaged suppliers across different industries 

to meet the needs of our diversified integrated 

resort’s portfolios, including food and beverage, 

utilities, IT products and services, gaming 

equipment and accessories, retail merchandise, 

entertainment, hotel supplies and amenities, 

marine exhibits, building and facilities maintenance 

services, furniture, fixtures and equipment, 

outsourced services and professional services. 

The supply chain engagement remained integral 

to our business growth and customer satisfaction 

as we innovated our products and services while 

maximising the environmental and social impacts.

Local Sourcing

In 2021, a total of 2,206 suppliers were engaged 

to support our business. We remain committed to 





Packaging Partnership Programme (PPP)

In recognition of our continued efforts to reduce packaging waste, we were invited by the PPP to be 

featured as a case study to provide guidance to companies seeking to reduce packaging waste through 

implementing 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) plans in their operations. The PPP is an industry programme 

supported by the National Environment Agency in Singapore.

Sustainable packaging for hotel amenities

HIGHLIGHTS

To manage financial, regulatory, fraud and 

reputational risks, we engage a third party risk 

database service provider, World Check by 

Refinitiv, in addition to executing adverse news 

screening via public sources, to screen all bidders 

participating in tenders and all new suppliers at 

registration point. Besides, we also put strategic 

suppliers on active monitoring.  

Our procurement practices have been well 

appraised by by both certification bodies and 

partners: 

 

- GSTC certified Destination and Hotels

 

- SACEOS MSC 

We also align our procurement practices to ISO 

20400: Sustainable Procurement and will continue 

to improve our processes in accordance with  

the standard. 

purchase from local suppliers to support the local 

supply chain and reduce our carbon footprint. 

Details can be found in page 63.

In support of the Singapore Government’s mission 

to increase food security, which is to have 30% 

of the national nutritional needs produced locally 

and sustainably by 2030, we have been increasing 

our engagement with local farms and exploring 

meaningful partnerships with local suppliers. In 

2021, we embarked on a collaboration with two 

new vegetable suppliers owning local processing 

facilities, and reached out to the local aquaculture 

farms for more sustainable fish feed. 

Sustainable Sourcing 

We continued to screen our suppliers against 

the sustainability criteria in our Procurement 

Sustainability Playbook and influence our supply 

chain to operate responsibly through our SCoC. 

We also reduced the environmental impacts of  

our procurement processes by digitalising all  

business transactions.

In 2021, we have completed another round of 

materiality assessment across our procurement 

spend portfolio and identified 22 material 

categories, for which we will continue to formulate 

relevant Sustainable Sourcing Guidelines. Of these 

material categories, food and beverage, cleaning 

and transport were placed as the top three 

priorities, and to be set with long-term targets.

Influencing Suppliers toward a 

Greener Supply Chain  

We continued to review and update our 

Sustainable Sourcing Guidelines, through which we 

now set mandatory requirements for suppliers and 

listed preferred green practices. For instance, it is 

now mandatory for all our cleaning services to be 

Clean Mark Silver-certified.  Our suppliers are also 

highly encouraged to implement cradle-to-cradle 

treatment of metal for metal-related jobs to close 

the waste loop. 

In 2021, we extended sustainability screenings

sustainability-related discussions during the 

RFQ stage. Looking ahead, we will continue to 

partner with key suppliers to improve their ESG 

performances and achieve a more sustainable and 

inclusive supply chain.

We continued monitoring the ESG risks of our 

suppliers across a range of issues including work 

safety standards, environmental footprint, respect 

for human rights, and anti-corruption. Notably, 

we started a more systematic assessment of the 

environmental footprint of our supply chain. Based 

on the outcome of the assessment, we will either 

procure more from suppliers who have committed 

to reducing their environmental impact or actively 

engage our suppliers on potential ways to reduce 

their environmental impact. 

Digital Procurement 

Transformation

Our digital procurement transformation journey 

started back in 2018 with e-Sourcing. We launched 

a resort-wide Procure to Pay system in 2019, 

which also included e-invoicing processes. As 

a result, we have successfully minimised the 

interruption brought about by the pandemic to 

our business transactions. Payments to suppliers 

can also be arranged swiftly despite work-from-

home arrangements. The continuity in business 

transactions and payments amidst the pandemic 

has therefore positively impacted our suppliers, 

especially small and medium enterprises. 

As part of our continuous drive for e-invoicing 

adoption, we conducted a series of supplier 

webinars for our existing suppliers to help them 

address common challenges faced in their 

transition to digital processes. Each training 

session covered an overview of processes 

followed by detailed step-by-step guides, 

demonstration videos, and finally a discussion on 

frequently asked questions and commonly  

made mistakes.

A diverse and inclusive 

workforce provides a balance of 

voices and experiences, which 

will help a business thrive across 

varied situations. We create 

a fair, inclusive and engaging 

workplace for our team 

members, who are key assets 

to Genting Singapore, and 

are committed to supporting 

local employment in Singapore 

through our business. 

HIGHLIGHTS

A testament to our efforts in championing 

inclusive hiring and commitment to 

transparency in gender-data reporting, 

Genting Singapore was added to the 

Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index in 

2021. Companies included in the index are 

recognised for their performance in five 

areas: Female leadership and talent pipeline, 

equal pay and gender pay parity, inclusive 

culture, sexual harassment policies and pro-

women brand.

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

OUR PERFORMANCE



OUR APPROACH

We are committed to ensuring that our work 

environment is one that is inclusive, non-

discriminatory and provides equal opportunities for 

all regardless of gender, race, religion and age. We 

believe that this is how we can create a conducive 

work environment where team members are 

encouraged to be their best selves. To ensure an 

inclusive culture in the workplace, we adopted the 

five principles of Singapore’s Tripartite Alliance for 

Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP).

To promote fair employment practices, we abide 

by the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment 

Practices and adopt the recommended Fair 

Consideration Framework (FCF). This means that we 

hire purely based on merit without soliciting personal 

information such as age, gender, race or religion in 

all our application forms. We assess each candidate 

fairly during the interview by focusing on questions 

relating towards candidates’ competencies to make 

hiring decisions. This helps to ensure hiring decisions 

are made in a consistent manner. We search for 

talent through various channels, including job portals, 

social media platforms, Institutes of Higher Learning, 

career fairs and collaborations with partners such as 

the Devan Nair Institute for Employment  

and Employability.

Furthermore, to ensure that we are able to attract 

and retain the best talents, we offer comprehensive 

benefits to team members, including medical 

insurance, health screening, and dental benefits. 

We also provide variable performance-based 

incentive for team members. The compensation for 

team members of various grades include both the 

fixed salary as well as variable performance-based 

incentive payments. This variable incentive payment 

is subject to review by the Remuneration Committee 

and approval by the Board. 

Apart from the variable performance-based 

incentive award, the Company also has short-term 

and long-term performance share awards. The use 

of both types of performance share awards ensures 

that there is an equal emphasis on both the short 

and long terms performance horizons. Performance 

share awards are accorded to team members who 

contribute towards achieving the strategic goals and 

profitability of the Group. The grant of performance 

share awards to eligible persons is subject to the 

Remuneration Committee’s recommendation and 

the Board’s approval.

We recognise that team 

member wellbeing is a key 

priority for us, especially after 

the COVID-19 pandemic has 

disrupted our way of life, 

causing anxiety and stress for 

employees. We believe that 

healthy team members make 

better decisions, maintain 

better relationships and co-

create a more cohesive and

support network where 100 team members, 

called TM Care Pals and TM Care Ambassadors, 

are trained to provide support to colleagues 

who are experiencing stress and anxiety. Team 

members who require professional assistance also 

have access to counselling service through our 

Employee Assistance Programme.

Physical Wellbeing

Apart from mental wellbeing, we also emphasised 

the importance of keeping fit and healthy. As a 

preventive approach to physical wellbeing, we 

provide comprehensive health insurance for all 

our team members. This include annual basic 

health screening programme in partnership with 

Prudential Assurance Company Singapore.

Team members can sign up for a complimentary 

basic health screening programme every year 

Key Performance Indicators

OUR APPROACH

Mental and physical health are equally important 

components of an individual’s overall health. In 

Genting Singapore, we adopt a two-pronged 

approach in promoting our team members’ 

wellbeing: 

 Mental wellbeing: We strive to create a  

 

workplace culture where team members can  

 

have open and regular conversations about  

 

mental wellbeing.

 

 

Physical wellbeing: We provide a safe  

 

and active work environment to promote team  

 

members’ health and boost productivity.

Peer Support Network  

for Wellbeing

In 2021, we set up the Team Member 

Wellbeing support network consisting 

of 100 team members who have been 

trained in Psychological First Aid and First 

Aid in Mental Health by the Singapore 

Counselling Centre. Called ‘Care Pals’ and 

‘Care Ambassadors’, these team members 

provide support to their peers who may be 

experiencing difficulties and need a 

listening ear. 

The programme follows a structured 

approach comprising three key pillars:

HIGHLIGHTS

counselling and recovery.

Staying true to our dedication to promote team 

members' wellbeing, approximately 43.6% of 

our workforce are members of the Attractions, 

Resorts and Entertainment Union (AREU). There 

is no operation and supplier at significant risk for 

incidents of forced or compulsory labor in 2021.

TRAINING AND EDUCATION 

OUR APPROACH

RWS Academy: Preparing for a 

future-ready workforce

The RWS Academy is our centre of excellence 

to build the capacity of our team members in 

integrated resort management. The Academy, in 

close partnership with our respective business 

units’ training teams, drives our efforts to raise the 

professionalism of team members and groom our 

future leaders. 

HIGHLIGHTS



In recognition to our commitment to develop 

our workforce while staying agile and resilient 

amidst the pandemic, we were awarded the 

SHRI 15th Singapore HR Awards 2021: Silver 

Award under the Learning and Development 

category. Through the RWS Academy, we 

groom our leaders, promote lifelong learning 

and advance sustainability knowledge. 

Learning through digital platforms 

We offer our team members opportunities for 

lifelong learning through innovative means despite 

the restrictions brought about by the pandemic. 

This includes adopting training approaches 

such as virtual live classrooms and e-learning 

platforms. In collaboration with NTUC LearningHub 

- Singapore’s largest subscription-based online 

learning platform - we offer our team members 

access to more than 75,000 online courses 

anytime, anywhere via self-learning RWS-LHUB 

GO to develop and enhance their critical core 

skills. For some courses, team members receive 

certificates of completion to recognise their 

learning milestones, which could be useful for their 

career development.

Grooming our talents

The Academy aims to equip the Company’s 

talents with leadership competencies and 

attributes.  As part of our structured talent 

development programme, our talents attend 

relevant leadership and management courses 

based on their personalised development plans.

Job redesign

We believe in the endless opportunities that both 

the Company and team members can benefit from 

lifelong learning. As the workplace continues to 

evolve, we provide team members job redesign 

opportunities to stay competitive. In collaboration 

with various departments, our HR department 

maps out the developmental needs and tailors 

relevant programmes to upskill and cross-train 

selected team members. 

Support for our trainers

Our internal trainers have access to competency 

maps to track their capability and development.  

They are also equipped with guidelines and 

resources to help our business units roll out quality 

internal training.  In addition, we train our internal 

content developers through the Instructional 

Design Skills training to design engaging training 

contents for our team members.

Partnerships

We form meaningful partnerships with government 

agencies such as Workforce Singapore, 

SkillsFuture Singapore, NTUC, and industry 

associations including the Singapore Hotels 

Association and Singapore National Employer 

Federation (SNEF) to address skills scarcity needs 

in the industry, stay relevant to the latest trends 

and developments in the market and contribute 

towards developing Worker 4.0.

provide the opportunity to bring their skills and 

experience to engage with communities and 

improve lives through our programmes. To 

encourage and expand volunteering opportunities 

for our team members, we have set a long-

term goal to achieve over 500,000 cumulative 

volunteering hours by 2030. 

Starting from 2022, we will embark on a long-

term partnership to engage and empower the 

community through RWS Cares. We will focus our 

efforts to support the community through our 

flagship programmes.

OUR PERFORMANCE 

Stepping Up During the Pandemic

In 2021, we extended our support and stood 

united with the Singapore Government for the 

second time to contain the community spread  

of COVID-19. We lend a helping hand to  

vulnerable groups that battled with the effects of  

the pandemic.

Through our timely response, RWS was able 

to install systems infrastructure successfully 

and efficiently within three days and mobilise 

volunteers in critical non-medical roles to run 

operations at the Community Treatment Facility 

(CTF). By harnessing their skills and experience in 

running large scale integrated resort operations, 

team members manned a 24/7 operations 

command centre which oversaw surveillance 

monitoring, incident tracking and a call centre 

handling resident inquiries. They also provided a 

suite of one-stop residency services comprising 

day-to-day duties such as pre-arrival coordination, 

admission and discharge, patient engagement, 

cleaning and sanitisation, housekeeping, meal 

management and supply of daily necessities. 

While caring for the elderly residents, our 

priority was also to safeguard the health, safety 

and wellbeing of our team members. Every 

volunteer received thorough and comprehensive 

training from infection control specialists before 

commencing their duties. These included the 

wearing and de-gowning of personal protective 

equipment including N95 masks, face shields and 

gloves. Additional safety measures such as team 

segregation, safe distancing, staggered meal 

times and installation of screen dividers reinforced 

discipline and vigilance.

Managing Agent of the Community 

Treatment Facility 

Staying true to our kampung spirit, RWS stepped 

forward once again as the Managing Agent of 

the CTF at the NTUC Health Nursing Home in 

Tampines to oversee a capacity of about 250 

beds with more than 120 RWS team members 

volunteering to care for COVID-19 patients.

was to manage control and coordination of the 

facility and residents on-site, as well as provide a 

comfortable and caring environment for elderly 

COVID-19 patients to rest and recover.

Empowering our Youth 

We recognise the importance of empowering and 

investing in the future of our youth. Our flagship 

mentoring programme aRWSome Apprenticeship, 

aims to empower, inspire and transform the lives 

of young people. We take at-risk youths under the 

wings of our experienced RWS team members, 

as mentors, in partnership with voluntary welfare 

organisations to impart crucial life skills and 

support them in being gainfully employed in the 

workforce.To equip our RWS mentors with the 

necessary skills and knowledge to educate and 

empower the at-risk youth, our new mentorship 

training workshop launched in 2021, provides 

mentors with soft skills on how to impart crucial 

life skills such as discipline, accountability, and 

grooming, as well as to offer socio-emotional 

support to their mentees. As we move forward, 

RWS will continue to work with voluntary welfare 

organisations and social service organisations 

to reach out and inspire at-risk youths through 

aRWSome Apprenticeship. 

CPF Community Paying it Forward

In 2021, RWS continued to play our part as 

a responsible corporate citizen – both inside 

and outside the integrated resort. As a partner 

with the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board’s 

Community Paying it Forward initiative, we 

engaged the community by sponsoring tickets 

to participants of the programme, to encourage 

them to learn more about CPF, make informed 

decisions on the use of their CPF savings, debunk 

misinformation and provide feedback to improve 

CPF services. RWS also provided learning 

opportunities through an engagement session to 

expand team members’ CPF knowledge, in order 

to help them better plan for retirement.

Globally, the focus on 

sustainability has increased 

dramatically. To effectively 

create positive outcomes, 

action needs to be taken on a 

mass scale. As an integrated 

resort welcoming millions 

of global visitors annually, 

RWS has a key role to play 

in complementing other 

societal efforts to further raise 

awareness and drive action for 

a more sustainable future. 

SUSTAINABILITY EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY

OUR APPROACH

With conservation and education being the 

key pillars of our marine-themed attractions at 

RWS, we focused on inculcating a culture of 

conservation at our venues through sustainability-

focused educational programmes for our 

community and guests. Our range of educational 

programmes, experiences, and events at S.E.A. 

Aquarium have always aimed to transform the 

way students learn about the world of marine 

life, increase visitors’ knowledge on aquatic 

ecosystems, and inspire positive change towards 

protecting marine species in an effective and 

engaging way. 

This year, with growing attention on climate 

change, we ramped up our efforts in sustainability 

education and advocacy. In addition to promoting 

sustainability behaviours among our guests, we 

have started to place more emphasis in reaching 

out to our guests, team members, suppliers, 

tenants, community, schools and institutions 

around us.

OUR PERFORMANCE

young participants from 18 schools during 

the virtual event. The event was organised 

in collaboration with SDC and Temasek 

Polytechnic, ahead of World Environment 

Day. All participants were posed the 

challenge statement - “Enhancing plastic 

and food waste management on Sentosa 

through active engagement between 

Sentosa stakeholders and visitors to the 

island”, where they were required to engage 

in design thinking to innovate and address 

the topic. The event was a success with 

the young participants receiving valuable 

knowledge in sustainability and prompted to 

think critically about climate issues.

Introducing ESG to Team Members 

In addition to facilitating sustainability initiatives 

with partners, we focussed on building the 

foundations of our own sustainability educational 

programmes. To do this, we expanded our 

own expertise and knowledge on sustainability 

by introducing our team members to the best 

practices observed in sustainable tourism. 

This was done through elearning that touched 

upon topics such as sustainable management, 

environmental management, cultural aspects as 

well as the socio-economic impacts of sustainable 

tourism. 

Participating in WWF Earth Hour

In support of the annual Earth Hour, RWS joined 

millions worldwide by switching off all non-

essential lights in the resort – a symbolic gesture 

of the Company’s commitment to reduce our 

carbon footprint. Beyond participating, we also 

actively encouraged our tenants and guests 

to support the global event by promoting it on 

our social media and email blasts. The event 

has allowed all to experience lives in the dark, 

encouraged the appreciation of electricity and 

raised awareness on the importance on saving 

electricity among our team members, suppliers, 

tenants and guests.  

Promoting Water Conservation in 

Partnership with PUB  

At Genting Singapore, we are dedicated to 

advocate the importance of reducing water 

wastage and cultivating water-conscious 

behaviour among our guests. This year, in 

support of PUB’s annual flagship event during 

the Singapore World Water Day, GoBlue4SG 

campaign, RWS lit its buildings and attractions in 

blue light to mark the Company’s commitment 

towards water sustainability. RWS also sponsored 

PUB’s newly launched Water Wally and Sally 

Club – a PUB’s Kids Club for children 12 years old 

and below to learn about water sustainability and 

inspire a new generation of water warriors. 

Influencing Suppliers toward a 

Greener Supply Chain 

We continue to review and update our 

Supplier Code of Conduct, including the Green 

Procurement Guideline, aimed to encourage 

purchases of sustainable products and services. 

Our buyers also actively collaborate with key 

suppliers in exploring innovative, eco-friendly 

solutions. For instance, we successfully influenced 

our suppliers to implement cradle-to-cradle 

treatment for our metal-related jobs in an attempt 

to close the waste loop for metals. 

As part of our continuous drive for paperless 

procurement process and e-invoicing, we 

conducted a series of supplier webinars to 

educate, onboard suppliers to RWS award winning 

digital procurement system and address common 

challenges faced by them. This serves to increase 

the efficiency and reduce paper consumption 

across the entire supply chain. For more details, 

refer to page 30.

Moving forward, we will continue to partner with 

key suppliers to improve their ESG performances 

to achieve a more sustainable and inclusive  

supply chain.

Promoting Eco-Friendly Practices 

among Our Tenants 

Our efforts to introduce sustainability advocacy 

were extended beyond our team members 

and guests. Starting this year, we implemented 

the Recommended Green Lease Guidelines 

underpinned by our Sustainability Policy to provide 

our tenants with guidelines on sustainable living. 

Tenants are encouraged to enhance recycling 

of materials, minimising energy and water 

consumption and maximising energy efficiency 

where possible.

Hosting Singapore’s First and 

Largest EV Event 

In December 2021, we were honoured to host 

Singapore’s first and largest EV motor show 

where we gave our guests the opportunity 

to explore the possibilities of owning an EV in 

Singapore with live EV test drives available to all. 

The event featured key speakers from the Tesla 

Owners Club Singapore and the Electric Vehicle 

Association of Singapore where panelists engaged 

the audience in an engaging discussion around the 

future of EV.

A safe and healthy workplace 

and destination for our team 

members and guests are 

fundamental to an integrated 

resort such as RWS. As a 

leading hospitality business, 

we also understand the 

importance of creating a safe 

and comfortable environment 

for our customers. 

HEALTH AND SAFETY 

OUR APPROACH

In Genting Singapore, Occupational Health 

and Safety (OHS) is led by the Safety Steering 

Committee that oversees the Safety Working 

Committee, Safety and Emergency Planning 

Department, and Safety Working Groups. There 

is also a dedicated safety committee in each 

department to promote safety practices relevant 

to team members’ roles and responsibilities on a 

more granular level as well as conduct monthly 

safety inspections with the Heads of Department. 

Beyond ensuring that our Workplace Safety 

and Health (WSH) policy meets all regulatory 

requirements, the comprehensive safety and 

health organisational structure also allows us to 

identify, mitigate and monitor health and safety 

risks efficiently. 

We believe that safety and accident prevention 

is everyone’s responsibility, and all team 

members should be empowered with the skills 

and knowledge to take ownership of workplace 

safety. Team members are always welcome to 

provide feedback on the health and safety policy 

and practices to their respective supervisors and 

safety representatives. The feedback consolidated 

will then be shared by the respective managers 

during the monthly safety committee meetings. 

To build a culture of open communication 

and mutual learning, work-related incidents 

investigated and safety messages are 

communicated to team members in multiple 

languages during departmental safety committee 

meetings, pre-shift briefings, safety videos at 

wardrobe areas, induction training, safety bulletins, 

safety alerts and monthly safety reports. 

The same set of health and safety standards 

The Safety Steering Committee sets overall strategy and direction for Workplace Safety and health matters, and 

is supported by: 

are extended to all external contractors and 

service providers. Mandatory safety induction and 

meetings with contractors are held before work 

commences. Appointed contractors and service 

providers will be reviewed regularly for their safety 

robustness and performance at work – these are 

important factors in our contract renewal process. 

Managing risks and incidents

We believe in preventive measures and focus on 

hazards identification and elimination. Our Safety 

and Emergency Planning department conducts 

frequent safety risk assessments through on-

site inspections with area owners and using 

inputs from near-miss and accidents reported. 

We review these safety risks regularly, including 

when incidents occur or when there are significant 

process changes.

Top Workplace Incidents from 2018 to 2020 and Measures Implemented

Reporting Incidents

We have several channels in place for our team 

members, contractors and service providers to 

report hazards and risks. These reports are then 

reviewed by the safety committee to approve the 

necessary corrective measures.

 

Hazard reporting: To report all hazards encountered

 

Work-related injuries reporting: To report all  

 

work-related injuries. All work-related injuries  

 

are recorded by the RWS HR Work Injury  

 

Compensation Act team and reported to the  

 

Ministry of Manpower (MOM) when required. 

 

Near-miss reporting: To report all near- 

 

miss incidents 

 

Whistle-blowing channels (HR touchpoints,  

 

WSH common mailbox, security hotline):  

 

To report unsafe acts anonymously. Under  

 

our whistle-blowing policy, Genting Singapore  

 

is committed to ensure that investigations are  

 

conducted in confidentiality. The whistle- 

 

blowing platforms and channels are overseen  

 

by the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) and  

 

administered with the assistance of the Head of  

 

Internal Audit.

Responding to Incidents

Corrective and preventive actions are implemented 

on work-related incidents identified. We also 

continuously monitor the actions implemented 

to ensure their relevance and effectiveness. 

Progress is then reported to the respective Head of 

Department on a monthly basis. 

Within the integrated resort, there is a medical 

clinic which is able to respond quickly to any 

medical emergency. For injured team members, 

we also have a ‘Return to Work’ programme to 

assist them with a smooth transition back to work. 

There will be early intervention services provided 

to support returning team members regain their 

work ability and long-term employability. Through 

this programme, we can minimise operational

Guided by the GH&amp;S Framework, our Emergency 

Preparedness and Response Plan outlines the 

safety best practices in our core operations. 

The plan is reviewed annually by the Safety 

and Emergency Planning (S&amp;EP) department 

together with the response plan owners to 

ensure continued relevance and communication 

to all operational staff. Fire safety, terrorism and 

disruptions caused by the pandemic remain to be 

areas with the highest potential impacts to our 

business. To address these impacts and remain 

prepared, our operations manage and monitor a 

range of safety measures:

Pandemic Response Protocols

To protect customers’ health, we implement a  

comprehensive pandemic response plan  

aligned with the Ministry of Health’s (MOH)  

national plan to keep the nation ready and safe.  

We implement control measures for four

OUR PERFORMANCE

Safe Management Measures  

at RWS

In 2021, our established Pandemic Response 

Protocols continue to play a significant role in 

protecting all our visitors from the COVID-19 

pandemic. We deployed over 270 sanitising 

stations and 600 sets of Plasmacluster Ionisers, 

which emit positive and negative ions to break 

down airbone microbes, across our resort. High-

touch surfaces such as the gaming tables and 

touch-screen kiosks were cleaned and disinfected 

regularly. Our air exchange system remains 

installed with High Efficiency (HE) filters and 

Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) rays to further disinfect the air 

and kill pathogens and airborne particles that  

pass through.  

SafeEntry check-in remain mandatory at entry 

points while Safe Distancing Ambassadors are 

deployed across the integrated resort to ensure 

that all visitors adhere to the SMMs. We also set

isolation procedures to tackle any food  

incident. With the robust internal investigation  

procedures, we are able to quickly trace  

sources and locations of contamination.  

Following an incident, we also ensure that  

equipment and venues are cleaned, disinfected  

and deodorised in addition to the provision  

of necessary medical  attention to all  

affected persons. 

Fire Safety Compliance

Our fire safety procedures greatly reduce the 

risks of system malfunctions and potential fire 

hazards. We conduct fire drills annually and 

undertake periodic testing and maintenance of our 

automated fire detection and protection systems. 

The RWS Company Emergency Response Team 

(CERT) and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) 

conduct a yearly joint fire rescue exercise to 

familiarise SCDF responders from Sentosa Fire 

Station with various high-risk installations in RWS. 

Together with RWS CERT, the team forms  

an integral part of the RWS emergency  

management team.

Terrorism Preparedness

Our protocols serve to prepare for and respond 

to  every situation. There are armed security  

personnel strategically stationed and mandatory 

security checks across the resort. Our preparation 

also includes engaging heightened security and 

carrying out a park-wide evacuation if deemed 

necessary. Our operations team also implement 

additional protocols to monitor:

A strong degree of trust with 

stakeholders will help businesses 

grow, and is particularly 

important in the event where 

recovery is needed, such as from 

the pandemic. Genting Singapore 

is committed to maintaining the 

highest standards of conduct and 

integrity in every aspect of our 

business. We have established 

robust governance practices to 

safeguard value creation for our 

team members, investors, and  

other stakeholders. 

GOVERNANCE AND ETHICS

OUR APPROACH

Genting Singapore conducts our business with 

integrity and in accordance with the law. We 

value our customers and provide them with a 

memorable and world-class experience while 

adopting a zero-tolerance compliance culture 

against any non-compliances to applicable laws. 

Our operations are guided by our Corporate 

Governance Framework shown below:  

Our Board and Senior Management are 

committed to complying with applicable 

legislative requirements and remain steadfast 

in conducting the business with integrity while 

providing leadership and guidance on regulatory 

compliance matters. We have established policies 

and structures to ensure adherence with all rules 

and regulations including environmental, anti-

corruption and anti-competition matters. 

Our commitment is set out in the “Corporate 

Compliance Policy Statement” introduced to all 

team members during the corporate induction 

training and thereafter on an annual basis, we 

require staff to acknowledge that they have read, 

fully understood and agree to comply with the 

requirements.

OUR PERFORMANCE

1  The Casino Regulatory Authority noted the potential to improve our internal controls to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing, and imposed a fine of S$275,000. We have since engaged an external subject  

 matter expert trainer to strengthen our internal controls and to facilitate implementation of these internal controls through training of PMLTF Committee members and PMLTF operations leaders.

We continuously evolve and update our ERM 

Framework and risk register to stay current with 

the fast-changing landscape. In 2022, we will 

be updating the Framework to better support 

enterprise-wide identification and resolution of 

environment-related risks. The revised Framework 

will also provide an improved systematic approach 

toward the identification and management of our 

risks.  

Anti-Competitive Behaviour

We adopt a zero-tolerance stance against anti-

competition, and detail our stance in our Code 

of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct. All 

our team members and suppliers are required 

to acknowledge, on an annual basis, that they 

have read, understood and will act in accordance 

with our Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of 

Conduct respectively. 

Prevention of Money  

Laundering and Terrorism 

Financing Framework

Casino operations are considered as inherently 

high-risk for money laundering and terrorist 

financing, with high volumes of large cash 

transactions taking place very quickly. We are 

committed to manage this risk in compliance with 

the Casino Control Act PMLTF Regulations 2009, 

and have robust controls in place to deter patrons 

and external parties from using Genting Singapore 

as a conduit for illegal activity. 

We have established three lines of defences 

towards PMLTF. Our defences start from the 

point a patron enters our casino, where our facial 

recognition programmes screen for individuals on 

terrorist lists or barred patrons, so that we can 

effectively prevent transactions with high risk of 

money laundering and terrorism financing. 

Our casino is a pioneer in the use of Facial 

Recognition (FR) technology as part of our 

control measures in the prevention of money 

laundering and terrorism financing. The use of FR 

is deployed at various locations, including patron 

self-help kiosks, to provide increased accuracy of 

transaction records, and to provide an efficient 

and seamless experience for our patrons during 

their visits. 

Our PMLTF Committee, which maintains oversight 

of our PMLTF framework, reports issues related 

to PMLTF through the Compliance Committee and 

the Compliance Officer to the Board.

The PMLTF Committee reviews and updates the 

PMLTF Framework annually to remain relevant 

and commensurate with RWS’ risk profile, 

including:

 

Reducing risk of having products and services  

 

used for money laundering and terrorism  

 

financing activities 

 

Compliance with legislative requirements 

 

Identification and adoption of risk based  

 

PMLTF-related industry practices 

All casino team members are kept updated on the 

PMLTF framework through mandatory orientation 

training and annual refreshers. 

Our day-to-day PMLTF operation are guided by 

four basic principles of:

 

Accountability (transactions are conducted by  

 

authorised staff only), 

 

Segregation of duties (eliminate conflicts  

 

of interest), 

 

Proper documentation (all transactions are  

 

recorded), and 

 

Supervision and timely review (supervision  

 

over team members, tasks and processes to  

 

ensure compliance).

Enterprise Risk Management

Our robust ERM framework is established to manage 

our operational risks including but not limited to 

operational disruptions, fraud, non-compliance to 

regulatory and legal requirements, financial loss 

and reputational damage so as to safeguard our 

assets to create long-term stakeholder value. Our 

framework is guided by the SGX Securities Trading 

Limited Listing Rule 1207 (10) and Code of Corporate 

Governance 2018 Principle 9.

We have established a dedicated team within 

Internal Audit to handle whistle-blowing cases in 

confidence, under the purview of the Audit and 

Risk Committee. Internal Audit reports to the Audit 

and Risk Committee on all whistle-blowing cases 

on a quarterly basis. 

Anti-Bribery and Corruption: A 

Zero Tolerance Approach 

Genting Singapore is committed to acting lawfully 

and with integrity in every aspect of our business, 

and in line with this commitment, adopts a zero 

tolerance approach against bribery and corruption 

of any form and upholds all applicable laws 

in relation to anti-bribery and corruption. This 

includes but is not limited to bribes, kickbacks, 

corrupt payments made for the purpose of 

inducing acts or omissions, and the solicitation or 

extortion of any of the above. 

Team members must not, whether directly 

or indirectly and whether for the benefit of 

themselves or of other persons, corruptly or 

improperly offer, promise, give, agree to pay, 

authorise payment of, pay, accept, or solicit 

“anything of value”. 

Every supplier is required to adhere to our 

Supplier Code of Conduct which details our zero 

tolerance stance against bribery and corruption. 

Customer Privacy

We treat the personal data of every customer 

with respect and privacy. As data security 

threats increase in significance, we continuously 

strengthen our organizational controls to protect 

our customers’ personal data.

We make every effort to respect our customers’ 

choices on the collection, use and disclosure 

of their personal information by practising 

responsible handling of customer data. Our 

dedicated Data Protection Office ensures 

compliance with the Personal Data Protection  

Act (PDPA).

Our personal data commitments to our customers 

are set out in our Personal Data Protection 

Statement. Our internal policies and procedures 

are routinely updated for team members to 

treat customer personal data responsibly and 

securely. Our team members undergo regular 

training on internal data handling policies and 

procedures so that they are aware of their 

responsibilities to customers’ personal data. We 

ensure organisational, physical and information 

security controls over access and sharing of 

customers’ personal data through regular testing 

and monitoring.

We will continue to enhance our governance 

and accountability processes to safeguard our 

customers’ personal data. More information on our 

Personal Data Protection Statement can be found 

on our website.

In 2021, we attained Medium Risk in Sustainalytics 

ESG Risk Rating. We continued to actively engage 

ratings agencies and relevant authorities such as 

SGX to close identified gaps in our performance 

and disclosures. In response to the feedback 

received, we have integrated more data and 

taken into consideration industry best practices 

in disclosures for this Sustainability Report. In 

addition, we have commenced our journey on 

TCFD, with the first disclosures in this section and 

are presently assessing the scope and next step 

of carrying out scenario analyses in the  

coming years.

In the second half of 2021, we established a multi-

functional task force to embark on the phases 

three and four of our disclosure journey, which 

are to develop different plausible climate change 

scenarios, including one adhering to the Paris 

Agreement, to test the resilience of our Company 

in different climate change futures and to integrate 

climate resilience and adaptation into our business, 

operations, strategic and financial planning.

Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 

TCFD aims to encourage consistent and comparable reporting on climate-related risks and opportunities by companies to their stakeholders. In the table below, we align our climate-related disclosures with the TCFD recommendations, 

structured around the four TCFD pillars.   

TCFD Pillars 

Genting Singapore’s Approach 

Governance 

The Board maintains oversight over the Company’s sustainability strategy and programmes, including climate-related programmes, and the relevant progress against goals. The Board is updated quarterly by the 

CEO on matters relating to sustainability strategies and developments, including climate-related risks and opportunities.

Climate-related risks are monitored and managed by the Sustainability Department and Risk Department, with support from the other business units. The Sustainability Steering Committee, chaired by GENS Chief 

Corporate Officer and co-chaired by the VP, Sustainability, and comprises of management representatives from various business units, is responsible for assessing and monitoring climate-related issues, providing 

recommendations as well as developing and implementing sustainability initiatives to address climate-related risks and opportunities.  

Details on our sustainability governance structure can be found on page 10 of our Sustainability Report. 

Strategy

Genting Singapore aims to be a leader in sustainable tourism and to create a harmonious relationship between planet, people and business. Aligned with the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and UN Sustainable 

Development Goals, we launched:

• RWS Full Circle, a framework to drive sustainable tourism and promote conscious consumption amongst our stakeholders;

• 2030 Sustainability Master Plan that outlines our ambitious goals including actions to drive decarbonisation towards a low carbon and circular economy.

Actions taken to manage climate-related risks and opportunities include: 

• Decarbonisation: Achieved 35% carbon emission reduction to date through energy efficiency projects, electrification, renewable energy installation and innovative technology adoption1

• Greening infrastructure and transport: Developed buildings and renovations projects that meet the BCA Green Mark standards;

• Nature preservation: Preserved the 2.9 hectares forest within RWS and implemented various biodiversity education, research and conservation programmes. 

In addition, we have started engaging an independent subject matter expert to identify climate-related risks and opportunities that bring material financial impacts to our business and strategy. We plan to 

incorporate the identified climate-related risks and opportunities as well as explore Science-Based Target initiatives (SBTi) to align with the Paris Agreement in our decision making on capital allocation and 

expansion plan. 

We will update our strategy based on the outcomes from our risk assessment process. 

Risk 

Management

Genting Singapore has developed a comprehensive risk management framework that aligns with our business strategy and guides our assessment of all material risks including climate-related risks. The framework 

was approved by the Audit and Risk Committee and its implementation is managed by the Risk Department. 

Genting Singapore addresses risks and opportunities through a multi-prong approach to assess transitional and physical risks and opportunities. Our sustainability initiatives are presented to the President and COO 

for review and approval. We track progress annually to evaluate emission reduction targets and assess the resilience of our business strategies.  

We define substantive financial or strategic impact as threshold of more than S$80 million annual impact and is classified as Major, Severe and Catastrophic risks impact rating scale for assessment of climate-

related risks. The climate-related risks we have identified are disclosed via the CDP platform.

TCFD Pillars 

Genting Singapore’s Approach 

Risk 

Management 

Examples of identified climate-related risks facing our business:

1. Emerging Regulations

   As climate change issues become more pertinent globally, governments may apply climate-related legislation or taxes that will necessitate businesses to re-evaluate and manage climate change risks. Emerging  

 regulations on climate-related matters must be reviewed regularly. An example is the Singapore Green Plan 2030 (SGP30), where the Government developed a comprehensive EV Roadmap to ramp up their  

 efforts for EV adoption. Singapore aims to phase out internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and have all vehicles run on cleaner energy by 2040. Prior to the announcement of Singapore Green Plan 2030,  

 Genting Singapore has identified this emerging risk and installed EV charging points at our premises to cater for increasing numbers of EVs cars, and has plans to increase the number of EV 

 charging points.

2. Acute Physical

 As extreme weather events and natural disasters (i.e. floods, droughts etc) increase in frequency and intensity, there is a need to take into account the acute physical risks that may present. These adverse   

 weather conditions can cause disruption to Genting Singapore’s business operations, particularly the theme parks and certain resort areas, which are exposed to weather elements. Significant weather events  

 such as floods can result in cancelled itineraries and raise safety concerns for our guests and team members. As RWS is built on Sentosa island and surrounded by sea, extreme precipitation could impact RWS  

 business leading to costly repairs and potential reconstruction. To mitigate this risk, RWS has implemented several risk control measures to minimise the risks.

Examples of identified climate-related opportunities facing our business:

1. Products and Services

 As awareness of climate change issues grows, recent studies show business clients and guests are becoming more interested in sustainable venues and hotels. It is crucial to build sustainability into both our   

 branding and differentiation, as well as the products and services we offer guests. We anticipate that preference for environmentally friendly destinations will continue to increase over the next few years. These  

 trends have a direct impact on Genting Singapore Group’s business. Engaging in a global environmental strategy will improve the Company’s corporate branding and in turn maintains our attractiveness to  

 customers and investors. Other than new offerings of environmentally friendly services such as the Eco-MICE package and RWS EcoTrail, Genting Singapore has also achieved several sustainable certifications  

 including the GSTC certification for hotels and as a destination to boost our position as Asia’s leading tourism destination. 

2. Access to Finance 

 Shareholders and investors are increasingly demanding stronger ESG performance before and during their investment in a company, with climate change being a major focus for many. As such, there has been  

 growth in the number of ESG ratings assessing the ESG performance of a companies. To ensure that we can continue to attract the right investors and lenders, Genting Singapore is committed to not only   

 improving our ESG performance, but also ensuring we do so in a transparent manner. This is aligned with our strategy to be a leader in sustainable tourism.

Our economic performances from 2019 to 2021 can be found in page 65.

Metrics and 

Targets

In 2021, we committed to becoming carbon-neutral by 2030 with an emissions reduction target of 30%  against a 2015 baseline and to invest in credible carbon credits to neutralise the remaining carbon profile. This 

builds on the emission reduction efforts we have embarked on since 2013. To boost our overall resilience, we have a set of goals to green our infrastructure and transport:

• Green 75% of buildings2

• Integrate sustainability principles and innovation into the RWS 2.0 expansion build

• 100% electric transportation

• Quadruple number of EV charging stations

We have also set other aspirations such as to reduce waste to landfill, and to increase renewable energy capacity including:

• 30% higher energy efficiency for new buildings

• 30% reduction in water consumption

• 50% reduction in waste to landfill3 

Genting Singapore’s GHG emissions data and status and progress of above goals can be found on page 62.

RESPONSIBLE GAMING

Responsible gaming is a 

cornerstone of our casino 

operations. We aim to continue 

being a leader in responsible 

gaming marketing, policy, 

management and programmes. 

We provide patrons with 

enjoyable gaming experiences 

and encourage responsible 

gaming. We are committed 

to ensuring compliance with 

all applicable legislation 

and collaborating with the 

Government, Responsible 

Gambling (RG) bodies, and the 

community to prevent problem 

and underage gambling.

OUR APPROACH

We aim to maintain our status as the top 

accredited gaming venue in the world by RG 

Check, and will continuously review our RG 

Framework against other jurisdictions, casino 

operators and RG bodies for best practices. In 

addition, we will scale up our outreach efforts by 

actively identifying more casino team members 

with the aptitude and skills to interact positively 

and effectively with patrons. Our RG Framework 

underpins how we deliver on this commitment.

Our RG Framework

Our RG Framework is focused on three key goals. 

Firstly, to implement a plan to identify patrons with 

observable problem gambling behaviours and 

provide information and referral to help services. 

Secondly, to deliver an ongoing responsible 

gaming education programme that promotes 

safer attitudes and gambling practices to enable 

patrons to make an informed choice. Thirdly, 

collaborate with the Government and stakeholders 

to build a responsible gaming culture based on 

continuous improvement and the adoption of best 

practices.

Our RG Framework, which incorporates RG Check 

standards, covers the following core areas:

 

RG Policies - integrated corporate policies  

 

and strategies to actively address  

 

problem gambling

 

Staff Training - strong focus on training to  

 

ensure team members are well-equipped when  

 

carrying out their role

 

Casino Exclusions - robust and comprehensive  

 

self-exclusion framework which facilitates  

 

access to help and support

 

Assisting Patrons - readily available help for  

 

patrons, with clear policies and procedures

 

Informed Decision Making - easily accessible  

 

information to help patrons make objective  

 

decisions including access to setting voluntary  

 

spend and time limits, and tracking gameplay

 

Advertising and Promotions - socially  

 

responsible advertising and promotions that  

 

do not mislead or target potentially  

 

vulnerable patrons

 

Access to Money - controls for access  

 

to money that do not encourage  

 

excessive spending

 

Venue and Game Features - safe environment  

 

including promoting awareness of passage of  

 

time and responsible use of alcohol

Accreditation by RG Check

RG Check is the world’s most comprehensive 

and rigorous responsible gaming accreditation 

programme that has been developed by the 

Responsible Gambling Council (RGC) Centre for 

the Advancement of Best Practices.

As part of RG Check’s accreditation, our RG 

programme assessment is based on eight core 

standards that include 47 criteria.

At RWS, we are committed to providing a safe 

gaming environment for our patrons. For our third 

round of accreditation, RWS is proud that our 

RG programme has achieved and maintained the 

highest worldwide RG Check accreditation score 

for six consecutive years.

“We commend RWS for 

achieving the best RG Check 

accreditation score worldwide 

for six years running. RWS 

commitment to continuous 

improvement demonstrates 

their RG leadership.”

Mrs. Shelley White,  

CEO of Responsible Gambling Council

Responsible Advertising

RWS is committed to socially responsible 

advertising and promotions. We have a stringent 

regime and processes in place to ensure that  

our advertisements and promotions do not 

mislead, contain any express or implied 

inducement or encouragement to play casino 

games, and do not target our domestic market, 

which includes Singapore Citizens and Permanent 

Residents, as well as individuals with gambling 

problems, under casino exclusion orders or minors. 

Our responsible advertising policy can be found 

on the Genting Rewards webpage.

Casino advertisements by RWS are in full 

compliance with the Government advertising 

regulations. RWS achieved a score of 98% in the 

area of “Marketing Communications” by RG Check. 

The assessment criteria comprised the following:

 

Having a marketing policy in place that commits  

 

to marketing that does not mislead players,  

 

misrepresent products, or target potentially  

 

vulnerable players.

 

A screening process is in place for all  

 

advertising to ensure adherence to the policy.

 

Marketing communications do not reinforce  

 

misconceptions about gambling.

 

Marketing communications do not target at-risk  

 

groups or promote risky behaviours.

 

Precautions are in place to limit marketing  

 

communications to high-risk players.

We also provide each patron with an RG kit 

that contains information on RG programmes, 

education materials on signs of problem gambling 

and help services available. The RG kit is 

provided upon enrolment into any of our casino 

membership programmes.

Player Education and Safeguards

RWS provides high-quality resources with wide 

coverage throughout the venue to maximise 

player reach. The RG Ambassador programme is 

a key resource for player education, as well as for 

access to help.  

Our casino entrances are designed to ensure that 

gambling activities cannot be viewed by anyone

Our RG Awareness training curriculum is reviewed 

regularly and approved by our RG Independent 

Advisory Panel to ensure relevance. All Casino 

Special Employees licensed by CRA (CSEL) must 

attend and pass the RG Awareness training 

before performing their casino-related work and 

thereafter required to attend annual refresher 

training which is tracked and reported to the 

senior management. 

Before any employee is appointed as an RG 

Ambassador, they must undergo additional 

special training conducted by RG specialists from 

National Addictions Management Service. The RG 

Ambassadors have to undergo RG Ambassador 

refresher training annually. In addition, they must 

undergo further enhanced training organised by 

the Ministry of Social and Family Development. 

The training programme is designed to equip RG 

Ambassadors with skills and knowledge to identify, 

respond to and provide assistance to patrons with 

observable signs of distress which may be related 

to problem gambling.

determine the length of time that they wish to 

play, and the amount that they intend to spend. 

They then receive personalised SMS notifications 

at selected milestones. 

In 2021, we conducted a patron survey to review 

effectiveness of the MGP, and received positive 

feedback: 

• More than 90% of patrons were satisfied with  

 

the MGP. They found it easy to use and  

 

effective in helping them monitor and manage  

 

their time and amount spent on gambling  

 

activities. 

• Additionally, the majority of respondents  

 

praised the effectiveness of RWS RG outreach  

 

efforts through both the RGA roadshows as  

 

well as the brochures and electronic displays  

 

across the casino floor. 



• Notably, more than 90% of enrolled patrons  

 

have continued to use MGP as a tool to  

 

monitor their gambling at Electronic  

 

Gaming Machines.

We provide self-service Membership Kiosks to 

enable patrons to check their gaming activity 

records such as visit frequency, duration of stay, 

and win/loss, as well as other useful RG resources 

like information on how gambling works, tips on 

safe gambling, and a problem gambling self-check 

test. 

Enhanced our Self-exclusion

Programme

We were the first casino in Singapore to introduce 

variable ban length options for patrons who make 





We continue to hold the highest RG Check 

accreditation score worldwide, a notable 

achievement as RG Council is the leading 

independent accreditation body for the 

global gaming industry. We are committed 

to maintaining the highest standards 

through our longstanding commitment to 

responsible advertising, player education 

and providing player safeguard options. 

HIGHLIGHTS

a request for self-exclusion. This is in line with 

international RG best practices. The enhancement 

considers that a non-permanent exclusion period 

lowers the psychological barrier for patrons who 

may wish to make a self-exclusion request. It also 

empowers patrons with decision-making options 

for them to initiate the application and revocation 

of self-exclusion.

RG Roadshows 

In conjunction with the national annual RG 

Awareness Week, RWS partnered with the 

Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) 

to run two roadshows on 30 November and 1 

December 2021 in our casino. The theme of this 

year’s RG Awareness week was “Play safe,  

Play smart”. 

Besides the RG Awareness Week, we conducted 

four other roadshows across the year to raise 

awareness of the various areas of our RG 

framework. Despite the lower visitorship resulting 

from the COVID-19 situation, during the roadshows 

our RG Ambassadors engaged 208 patrons and 

enrolled 98 patrons into the Manage Game Play 

programme.

Casino Entry Checks using Facial 

Recognition System

Our casino entry system is designed to ensure 

that all patrons entering the casino are screened 

to prevent entry by minors, excluded persons, 

and persons subject to visit limits. Patrons are 

required to produce their Government issued 

photo identification to enter the casino. The 

use of Optical Character Recognition and Facial 

Recognition technology deployed to complete 

identification and impersonation checks is a strong 

deterrent in preventing and identifying attempts to  

enter the casino using another person’s  

identification documents.

The COVID-19 pandemic has 

disrupted global travel and 

consumption patterns, while 

climate change is driving a 

global transition towards a low 

carbon future and awareness 

of social and environmental 

concerns. Such changes pose 

not just challenges, they are 

also opportunities to emerge 

stronger. As an early mover in 

sustainable tourism practices, 

we are well-positioned to meet 

changes in demand and lead 

the industry.

SUSTAINABLE TOURISM

“Resorts World Sentosa is the first destination in the world to be certified in the 

following two ways, certified as a destination to the GSTC Destination Criteria and 

achieving certification of hotels within its jurisdiction to the GSTC Industry Criteria 

for Hotels. These accomplishments serve as credible evidence that RWS takes a 

holistic and systematic approach to sustainability and is making a true commitment  

to continuous improvement in  their operations,” 

Randy Durband, 

CEO of the GSTC

OUR APPROACH

RWS is committed to being a pioneer in

sustainable tourism and building a more relevant 

and resilient business. RWS’ vision is to be a 

global leader in sustainable tourism. That belief 

has led us to launch RWS Full Circle, a framework 

to drive sustainable tourism and create a 

harmonious relationship between People, Planet 

and Business. 

To achieve the vision, we will

 

Adopt global standards and best practices  

 

for sustainable tourism 

 

Expand our range of sustainable 

 

programmes and experiences 

 

Engage our stakeholders for their feedback

Adopt global standards and best 

practices for sustainable tourism 

 

RWS will continue to adopt global best practices 

in sustainable tourism by keeping abreast of 

industry developments, benchmarking and 

aligning our practices against global certifications. 

The momentum to be more mindful in how we 

live and travel has been steadily increasing in 

recent years. Based on the Booking.com’s 2021 

Sustainable Travel Report, 72% of travelers 

believe they have to act now to save the planet 

for future generations with 76% of travelers 

pledging to seek accommodation with reputable 

third-party sustainability accreditation.

Sustainable Programmes 

and Experiences 

We are committed to encouraging and 

empowering conscious consumption through 

various sustainability themed experiences.

This is in line with our vision to be a global leader 

in sustainable tourism.

RWS EcoTrail

Sustainability has been at the heart of RWS’ 

business since our inception. With the new 

EcoTrail, guests can now go behind the scenes to 

witness these elements that make us sustainable. 

With over 15 highlights across the resort, such as 

our 2.9-hectares forest, solar photovoltaic system 

and herb garden, we aim to inspire our guests to 

similarly take action in their daily lives. 

Eco-MICE Package

To ramp up our sustainability drive amongst 

corporate customers, we launched MICE 

packages. Our aim is to help accelerate the 

growing shift to sustainable events and shape the 

growth of eco-tourism in Singapore. RWS’ Eco-

MICE package provides clients with options to hold 

events designed with sustainability at the heart. 

 

Waste reduction: Guests enjoy meals served  

 

in sustainable packaging, and will be provided  

 

with reusable pens and recycled paper.  

 

Unserved food will be donated to the  

 

Food Bank to reduce food waste. In addition,  

 

food grinders and a biodigester have been  

 

installed in our kitchens to significantly reduce  

 

the amount of food waste to landfill. With this  

 

more efficient waste management, RWS has  

 

avoided the use of 72,000 plastic trash bags  

 

every year. 

 

Low carbon transportation: RWS will also  

 

encourage the use of public transportation by  

 

providing all delegates with a complimentary  

 

EZ-Link card with S$5 stored value. 

 

Energy reduction: All MICE venues at RWS have  

 

been retrofitted with energy efficient  

 

LED lighting and motion-activated lighting in  

 

washrooms, with plans to upgrade air  

 

conditioning chillers to improve efficiency.

T.G.I.G Weekend Bazaar

As one of Singapore’s largest and premium 

venue providers, RWS is privileged to be 

awarded the SACEOS MSC Intermediate Tier 

for Venue certification in June 2021. This is 

a testament to the Company’s successful 

implementation of an organised approach to 

adopting sustainability guidelines, as well as 

achieving advanced sustainability performance in 

its MICE operations. SACEOS MSC was developed 

based on sustainability guidelines launched by 

the Singapore Tourism Board, aimed to align 

businesses in the MICE industry with the national 

sustainability agenda.



In July 2021, RWS became the first destination in 

the world to be certified to the GSTC Destination 

Criteria and achieving certification of hotels within 

our jurisdiction to the GSTC Industry Criteria for 

Hotels. The GSTC was founded by United Nations 

agencies such as the United Nations Environment 

Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations 

World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) and is 

an international body created to establish and 

manage global standards for sustainable travel 

and tourism.

HIGHLIGHTS



In collaboration with The Green Collective SG and in 

support of NEA’s Say Yes to Waste Less campaign, 

we presented the T.G.I.G. Weekend Bazaar, a pop-

up event that showcased a selection of sustainable 

local brands. 

The event was held over five weekends from 30 

October to 28 November, and welcomed visitors to 

head down to the S.E.A. Aquarium for eco-friendly 

shopping. 

A total of 12 environmentally-friendly brands were 

featured, providing an array of products, from 

fashion and lifestyle to daily necessities. Brands 

included The Eco-Statement (Singapore’s first eco 

board game and card game), Petale Tea (artisan 

flowering tea), and Indosole (fashionable footwear 

made from recycled tires). 

This initiative is an effort to promote awareness 

about sustainability, and to provide local small and 

medium-sized enterprises a platform to showcase 

their products and grow their customer base.

Electric Vehicle Event  

We constantly seek out meaningful collaborations 

with industry partners to advocate sustainability. 

We are honoured to be the official venue partner 

of Singapore’s first and largest EV Event by 

UCARS. This is the first event to bring together top 

EV leaders and industry giants. It is a go-to event 

for consumers who are looking to embark on 

their EV journey. Through this, we aim to promote 

adoption of EVs and provide consumers with a 

platform to learn more about the sustainability and 

benefits of EVs.

Since 2021, we started collecting guest 

satisfaction data on our educational, 

conservational and sustainability efforts. We 

received positive feedback across all hotels and 

attractions including at the S.E.A. Aquarium where 

we have expanded on our sustainability offerings. 

The areas covered include waste, energy and 

water efficiency, sustainable dining, as well as 

education and outreach. We will continue to track 

the data year on year and use the data as a basis 

to continuously improve the relevance of  

our efforts.

Advocating Sustainability through Initiatives 

and Fan Engagement at the Attractions 

S.E.A. Aquarium presented Aqua Gastronomy, an 

immersive and multisensory dining experience 

combining a sustainable seafood menu with 

storytelling, atmospheric ambience and ocean-

themed décor. We also curated content and 

designed experiences to communicate our 

sustainability efforts through family-friendly 

thematic experiences, such as S.E.A. Aquarium x 

Pinkfong Baby Shark. Interactive stations and play 

zones were designed both to engage guests and 

to showcase important messages about ocean 

preservation, protection and more. A music and 

light interactive game at the Musical Walkway 

highlighted examples of how children can practice 

more sustainable behaviours, and contribute to 

ocean conservation. Our interactive multiplayer 

recreation station, which gamified concepts on 

pollution, allowed young children and parents to 

learn through play activities such as ‘cleaning up’ 

the ocean.  

Our attractions also implement a range of other 

sustainability measures within our core activities. 

To increase the percentage of sustainable fish 

feed, the attractions have been maintaining and 

exploring new vendors as well as fish feed options. 

We also aimed to identify suitable kitchen discards 

and leftover feeds from some small habitats to be 

used for feeding in the Ship Wreck, Open Ocean 

Habitat and Sea Jellies. In 2021, the team worked 

to identify alternate fish feed types to increase 

the percentage to 72% from previous years 

and repurposed food discards.  From the daily 

animal care operations, single use plastics were 

also reduced by changing the way we repack 

vegetables, using reusable plastic buckets instead 

of single use plastic bags. 

Guest Satisfaction and Feedback

We believe that good business can go hand in 

hand with sustainability. With well-trained team 

members and SMMs, we take every step to employ 

sustainable and safe practices whilst incorporating 

stakeholders’ suggestions and feedback into our 

sustainability initiatives and plans.

Guest Satisfaction Survey

Our efforts on guest satisfaction are focused 

around creating positive experiences and leaving 

our guests with memorable experiences. Through 

guest satisfaction surveys, we gather feedback 

on guest experiences and areas of improvement 

across hotels and attractions, monitor our 

performance and benchmark against industry 

standards. The data collected through the 

surveys are analysed and shared with relevant 

departments monthly to address gaps in our 

performance and develop improvement plans.

 

Our performance data highlights the progress in 

our Guest Satisfaction Scores (GSS) across our 

attractions and hotels over the last three years. 

While the GSS results are largely influenced 

by strict implementation of SMMs resulting in 

limitations to product offerings and in some cases, 

possibly “less-than-expected” guest experiences, 

we are still able to achieve above 80% in most 

areas of guest satisfaction (refer to Guest 

Satisfaction Score chart on right).

Understanding our water consumption patterns is crucial in identifying the most effective way to reduce and 

conserve water. The bar charts below show our water consumption and ocean water supply from 2019 to 2021. 

We champion good waste management practices. In 2021, we recycled 10 waste streams and achieved 21.44% 

waste diversion rate. 

We strive to source our products and services locally to support local businesses and minimise our  

carbon footprint.
