Board Statement  

Established in 1969, Broadway Industrial Group Limited (“Broadway”) is one of the leaders in 

the manufacture and assembly of precision components with 4 manufacturing facilities in 

China and Thailand, employing around 3,900 people. With such a wide manufacturing footprint, 

we believe it is our corporate and social responsibility to apply our experience, expertise and 

resources to address the environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues that arise 

wherever we do business.  

The Board of Broadway are responsible for the strategic direction of the group and key 

decisions made must be based on up to date relevant information about the various risk, 

opportunities and trends in the industry, the region and across the globe. To get a full picture 

of the various risks, opportunities and trends that could affect the group, the board must take 

sustainability into account. This more holistic picture is crucial for the continued success of our 

business.  

The Board of Directors (“the Board”) is pleased to present our second annual Sustainability 

Report. Our report references the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) standards and is in line 

with the SGX sustainability reporting requirements. Broadway continues to maintain a 

sustainability governance team within the group, and this year, the management considered 

the continued relevance of the seven material ESG factors, identified in 2017. As there were 

no major changes in our business nor shifts in the sustainability landscape, management have 

determined to continue with the ESG factors as per last year. The Board oversees the 

management and monitoring of the selected material ESG factors and approves the annual 

sustainability report.

Sustainability at Broadway 

Consumers continue to become increasingly aware of the environmental and social impacts of 

the products they purchase. Particularly in the electronics industry where global sustainability 

issues affect global value chains. It is important to remain sensitive to demands and needs all 

the way along our supply and value chain in order to properly serve our clients and continue 

to succeed in our business.  

There are a number of initiatives that we have in place that allow us to address these changing 

demands. One of them being the adoption of the Responsible Business Alliance (“RBA”), 

originally under the name “Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition” (“EICC”), Code of 

Conduct in order to give comfort to our clients and in turn their clients and customers that we 

uphold the same level of common standards.  

The adoption of the RBA Code of Conduct as the overarching managing strategy of our ESG 

issues allows us to follow a standard framework for managing our environmental, social and 

governance concerns as well as fulfil the expectations of our clients. Broadway continues to 

have five pillars of sustainability, covering issues on economic performance, environmental 

responsibilities, employee wellbeing, health and safety as well as ESG governance. Through the 

holistic management these five pillars in our sustainability approach, we can bring about 

positive environmental and social impacts for our employees, local communities and clients 

alike.

Materiality Assessment 

We believe it is important for us to focus on the areas which are most relevant to our business. 

In 2017, a formal materiality assessment was conducted to identify ESG risks and opportunities 

that are most important to our business and stakeholders. The materiality assessment was 

guided by the GRI Principles of Materiality and Stakeholder Engagement, and considered the 

following aspects:  

• 

Global and local emerging sustainability trends;  

• 

Main topics and future challenges for the electronics sector, as identified by peers;  

and 

• 

Insights gained from interactions with both internal and external stakeholders.  

This year, the management team reviewed the seven selected material factors and considered 

them against the backdrop of the previous year. As there were no major changes in the 

business or the sustainability landscape, the existing seven ESG factors were considered to still 

be relevant. These are shown in the table below.

Environmental Responsibilities  

Broadway understands that the activities of the business have the potential to affect the 

environment and its surroundings. We are committed to conserving natural resources and 

reducing our environmental impact and we particularly focus on conserving natural resources, 

such as non-renewable energy sources and water. We believe our most impactful contribution 

is to practice resource efficiency. Resource efficiency can also bring tangible benefits to 

Broadway such as significant cost savings.  

Regulation continues to tighten in the various countries that we operate in regard to 

environmental compliance. Carefully managing our emissions, sewage and waste is important, 

not just for regulatory compliance but also to be considerate to the local communities in 

proximity to our operations.  

Broadway continues to maintain our ISO14001:2015 certified Environmental Management 

System (EMS), which governs our environmental performance, such as energy consumption, 

water consumption, waste and effluents, and materials, in order to achieve a higher level of 

environmental responsibility.

Our main machining activities are reliant upon the use of electricity and some non-renewable 

fuels such as diesel, petrol and gas. Therefore, energy use is both critical for the continued 

operations of our business as well as one of our main environmental impacts. Broadway is 

committed to managing its energy use in order to allow our business to continue to operate 

whilst also mitigating our negative impacts.  

Broadway has in place an Energy Policy to systematically manage our energy performance at 

each of our locations. We also continue to follow our energy masterplan. Our energy 

masterplan details our targeted KPIs and the initiatives that we hope to achieve each year. We 

continue to track the completion status of these scheduled initiatives and supervise our energy 

efficiency through daily checks and monthly analytical reports. Our practices and initiatives 

include the following:  

• 

Ensuring regular maintenance of plant machinery and air conditioning units 

• 

Reducing standby consumption by plant machinery and air conditioning units during 

production breaks and non-production time by either running them on lower power or a 

temporarily shutting them down.

• 

Installing sub-area light-switches to increase controllability and maximise utilisation of 

natural light; and  

• 

Replacing existing T8 light fittings with T5 fluorescent lamps, which are more energy 

efficient. 

 

Case study BIGL Technologies (Thailand) Co Ltd.: 

Over the course of 2018, our facilities in Thailand have seen a complete change over from 

fluorescent lamp T8 to the more efficient T5 type lamp. A total of 87 florescent lamps have 

been switched out for electricity saving alternatives. 

We have also adjusted the operations of our various machinery for more efficient energy usage. 

We have adjusted the speed motor FFU from 100% (1,050 rpm) to 60% (630rpm) and stopped 

some FCU &amp; OAC units for standby support all cleanroom on holiday and nonproduction time. 

Electricity usage continues to account for more than 99% of total energy consumption, among 

other types of energy such as diesel, petrol and natural gas. We recorded a 4% decrease in 

energy intensity between 2017 and 2018, from 0.73 MJ of energy consumption per unit of 

production in 2017 to 0.68 MJ of energy consumption per unit of production in 2018.

management /disposal 

 

Waste is inevitably produced at a number of stages in the manufacturing process. Waste 

produced at our operations include metals, wooden pallets, oils and general waste. Each type 

of waste is treated appropriately to avoid harm to environmental and human health.  

The systems in place allow Broadway to track, manage and report waste at our manufacturing 

facilities. Broadway actively identifies and implements waste minimisation initiatives through 

the“3R” approach, which promotes “Reduce, Reuse and Recycle”.  

At Broadway, waste is categorised into three broad categories, as follows:  

• 

Recyclables including paper, carton boxes, metal scraps, plastics, electronics, pallets and 

shipping trays; 

• 

Non-recyclables including general waste and process waste; and  

• 

Hazardous waste including chemicals and heavy metals. 

We have a waste management policy which allows us to standardise the definition of each 

waste category and specify the corresponding storage and disposal method. The handling of 

each waste type is colour-coded and clearly delegated to respective departments. One of the 

ways we “reduce” our waste is to improve the packaging design and we have implemented a 

system for packaging, particularly our pallets, reuse. Hazardous waste is handled with extra 

precaution and we are careful to follow all regulations where relevant. We also carry out 

weekly audits to ensure that our policies and procedures are being correctly followed. In 

addition, regular checks are performed to ensure that the appropriate licensed waste 

collectors have been engaged. Our effluent discharge is also closely supervised and monitored.  

We have engaged a third-party specialist to monitor our effluent and ensure that our 

wastewater quality meet the statutory environmental requirements. We have tightened the 

monitoring and recording of raw water usage, using the water and recycled water meters. This 

allows us to better track our usage and alerts the team on aby potential leakages in the piping 

systems. 

As a policy, we recycle 100% of the recyclable waste that we have. This means that all our 

pallets and cartons are reused/recycled. In 2018, we maintained the percentage of waste that 

was reused, recycled or composted as per 2017 levels, meeting our 2018 target. Going forward, we are 

targeting zero-incidents of non-compliance with laws and regulations concerning waste 

management/disposal.

Labour Practices  

We believe equal opportunities and fair labour practices drive loyalty and productivity in our 

staff base. This is why our human resource policies are grounded in equal opportunities and 

fair employment practices. In our recruitment process, all qualified candidates will be 

considered without discrimination of gender, age, ethnicity, religion, marital status, sexual 

orientation, trade union association and national origin.  

Diversity is also important for a creative workforce, able to handle and manage a wider range 

of challenges that come their way. This resilience is important for Broadway’s continued 

success. The charts below provide a quantitative measure of employee diversity. As of 31 

December 2018, we have in total 2,555 full-time employees in BTH and BWX.

To maintain a strong team that understand each other’s roles and functions, we arrange 

regular teamwork and collaboration events.  

 

In 2018, these events included an Indoor Sports day and an Environmental 5S Cleaning Day at 

BWX. The Indoor sports day aimed to build team spirit and for staff to mingle with other 

departments and get to know each other better. The games were inside a small indoor area 

instead of outdoor big area and most of the games were modified to make them more 

interesting and challenging for the participants. There were prizes for the winner of each game. 

The Environmental 5S Cleaning Day was to encourage staff to show pride in their environment 

and surroundings and involved staff in teams of 2-3 persons to patrol through the factory 

compound area to clear away all the rubbish.

Training is important for updating our employees with skills necessary for growth. We feel it is 

both a responsibility and an opportunity for the business to provide our employees with 

internal and external training that will support their growth.  










 

Sustainability Report 2018

We provide a range of learning and development programmes to cater to the learning needs 

of our employees, covering topics such as management and leadership, professional skills 

training, software and languages. To emphasise on the importance of corporate citizenship, 

we incorporate ESG education in our orientation training for employees, where we raised 

awareness on environmental responsibilities, business ethics, as well as occupational health 

and safety.  

 

 

To further support the professional growth of our employees, annual performance reviews are 

conducted to communicate employees’ performance and career goals. In 2018, 100% of 

employees received feedback on their performance as well as suggestions for improvement 

from their supervisors.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



Staff Training - Wuxi 



Aside from our usual and ongoing staff training and development, in 2018, we had two major training events. 

Annual First Aid Training 

20 staff members participated in a First Aid Training Course. The practical training was conducted over half a 

day at our Wuxi location and led by a qualified Red Cross Certified Trainer. The training provided basic first aid 

knowledge on how to respond in the event of an accident or heart attack, or other common first aid scenarios.  

Each staff received a Red Cross First Aid badge for course completion.  

Effective Communication and Management  

A one-day training course was held for 40 BWX employees. The training course aimed to increase the 

effectiveness of communication and business management and was conducted by an external consultant. 

Managers were training in effective communication and management of teams in order to gain better results 

from their team members. The class was conducted in groups of 4 or 5 with each group participating in the 

various group activities.

Staff Training - Thailand 



Aside from our usual and ongoing staff training and development, in 2018, we held a major Six Sigma training 

across the staff base. 

Six Sigma 

Six Sigma is a comprehensive and flexible system to achieve, sustain and maximize business success. 

The essence of Six Sigma is  

•

Detailed and current understanding of customers’ needs 

•

Disciplined use of facts, data and statistical analysis 

•

Emphasis on managing, improving and re-inventing key business processes to reduce variation and 

improve quality. 

BIGL conducted one wave of Six Sigma training across all sites between Jul-2018 to Dec-2018. A total of 39 Six 

Sigma Black Belts have been trained. 

Refresher and enhancement coaching for Six Sigma Black Belts and special training for people managers are 

carried out on an on-going basis by BIGL Six Sigma Coordinator to grow the Six Sigma culture through-out BIGL. 

Deployment of Six Sigma is a major effort in striding towards becoming the preferred supplier partner by our 

customers. 

 

 

English language training 

Staff in Thailand were also given the opportunity to improve their English language through English language 

training conducted in 2018. This was considered important for their general knowledge and welfare, as well as 

for reporting into Singapore HQ. A professional trainer was engaged for this initiative.

each location has a health and safety 

team in place and prepared to react 

to issues. The flow chart below outlines our management process regarding occupational 

health and safety.  While occupational health and safety (“OHS”) responsibilities are shared 

among all departments, the manual specifies the responsibilities of each department as either 

taking the lead or supporting role in specific OHS issues, thus improving accountability. But 

policies and procedures are not useful unless the culture of safe working is inculcated, and 

each employee feels a sense of ownership for health and safety. OHS are integrated as one 

essential part in employee on-boarding programmes.  





What is OSHAS 18001?  





OHSAS 18001 is a worldwide accepted British Standard 

which outlines Good Practice requirements for the

As part of the culture of safety, identification of risks is a key step in the process. Based on 

experience and site visits, we have categorised occupational hazards into five different risk 

levels based on a matrix of:  

i) 

Possibility of occurrence; 

ii) 

Frequency of exposure for employees and;  

iii) 

Severity of consequences 

All risks graded “Highly Dangerous” and above will need to be registered and approved by the 

management. Targeted actions plans are also tailored to mitigate those risks, as illustrated in 

the Hierarchy of Controls chart below.   

 

Once risks are identified, Broadway strengthens its preparedness by conducting regular checks 

and arranging contingency plans. For example, for all chemicals, Broadway obtains Material 

Safety Data Sheet from suppliers, which documents the potential hazards (health, fire,

reactivity and environmental) of the chemical product and how to work safely with it. Labelling 

of chemicals and its dangers being adequately signposted will allow this hazard to be better 

managed. Training for all employees is completed to be sure they understand the how to 

handle the chemicals and the standard safety procedures in chemical storage, transportation 

and utilisation. In BTH, we also perform monthly safety patrols in the factories. All practices 

that raise concerns will be recorded, and follow-up remediation are monitored and tracked.  

In 2018, there were no workplace fatalities. The accident frequency rate (“AFR”) was 0.50 and 

the accident severity rate (“ASR”) was 5.13. The absentee rate was 1.48 days per employee per 

year. Although it appears our AFR and ASR have decreased, the decrease is in fact due to a 

change in definition. In 2018, we included injuries that result in at least one day medically 

certified leave.

Sustainability Governance  

Broadway has established a formal sustainability governance structure to manage 

sustainability related issues effectively.

Corruption prevention and environmental and socio-economic compliance are areas which are 

strictly managed, operating through a framework of prudent controls.  

The prevention of corruption is managed through the set up anti-corruption policies, covering 

topics such as the employment of relatives, receiving of gifts and entertainment, as well as 

conflict of interest. Employees are made aware of these policies though employee orientation 

and they are included in the Employee Handbook. A Whistleblowing Policy protects our 

employees if they were to report any improprieties in good faith. In 2018, there was zero 

incidence of confirmed corruption and we aim to maintain the same level of performance for 

2019.  

As a baseline, we must meet regulatory compliance in order to meet stakeholders’ 

expectations and maintain the license to operate. As with our other business risks, at Broadway, 

we include regulatory risks into the framework of risks that we assess, monitor and manage. 

We adhere to relevant environmental and socio-economic laws, which governs a range of 

issues like effluent discharge, labour practices, health and safety, as well as intellectual 

property and privacy. Having a robust ESG management system, as demonstrated by the 

effective governance of the key sustainability pillars in the sections above, helps Broadway to 

reinforce ESG policies and monitor compliance. In 2018, there was no incidence of non-

compliance with environmental and socio-economic laws and regulations which resulted in 

significant fines or sanctions. For more information, please refer to Corporate Governance 

Report in Broadway’s Annual Report 2018.  

Supplier Environmental and Social Assessment  

2018 Highlights 

 

We recognise that our environmental and social impacts extend beyond the boundaries of our 

company to the value chain. As we engage with various suppliers for our material needs, we 

will have to ensure that the materials obtained are of quality. In order to manage both quality 

and ESG impacts, we require that that suppliers met certain standards such as the RBA. With 

higher expectations placed on corporate responsibility by consumers, almost all our key clients 

have joined the RBA’s network to push the sustainability agenda within the electronics 

industry. As a Tier 1 supplier of electronic parts, Broadway is expected to be held accountable 

to the common code of conduct of RBA. In turn, Broadway has exercised similar due diligence 

processes on our suppliers.  

 

 

 

This supplier assessment is integral to our risk management and we have a set of policies and 

procedures in place to screen our suppliers as well as support them to implement the RBA

Code of Conduct. We provide training programmes for suppliers to communicate the code 

requirements.  

Prior to formal engagements, we will socialise RBA-related expectations with suppliers. An RBA Code of 

Conduct Checklist will have to be completed, or a Letter of Commitment will have to be signed. For 

assurance purposes, Broadway also conducts random onsite visits and audits for the shortlisted 

suppliers for RBA compliance. Moreover, we strengthen monitoring on key suppliers by mandating RBA 

Validated Assessment Process (VAP)4, which is completed by third-party independent auditors.  In 2018, 

we have screened 100% of new suppliers using environmental and social criteria. In addition, 

the team at BTH completed audit site visits of two of our suppliers. These visits are completed 

every two years and key agenda items for inspection are labour conditions, Health and safety, 

Environment and Ethics.

We use conflict-free minerals  



Due to the nature of our electronics business, we inevitably use various minerals, including 

tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold (commonly referred to as “3TG”), which originate in mines 

around the world. The 3TG metals have become known as “conflict minerals” because much of 

it is sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries where a 

decades-long civil war is being waged. This conflict has been exacerbated by various groups 

fighting to control mines and transit routes used in the trade of these minerals.  

Broadway has exercised extra prudence on the due diligence of the source and chain of custody 

of these minerals. We avoid directly or indirectly financing or benefitting those armed groups 

by using conflict-free minerals.

Corporate Social Responsibility  

Broadway aspires to bring about positive social and environmental impacts to the local 

community. In 2018, Broadway has launched several CSR activities to give back to the society. 

Blood donation 

These initiatives included a blood donation drive. Every 4 months, an area of our facilities is 

converted into a clinically prepared blood donation centre, where BTH staff are encouraged to 

come down and donate. 

 

Tree planting drive 

In addition, 15 staff from BTH joined Tree Planting project with Hi-Tech Industrial Estate, the 

purpose of this activity was to increase environmental -awareness and to improve the quality 

of the natural environment and help to restore degraded land.
