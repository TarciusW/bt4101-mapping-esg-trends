Our Vision

The Group’s Code of Conduct (“Code”), comprising internal corporate governance practices, policy statements and 

standards, serves as a guide to all its employees and officers for both legal compliance and appropriate ethical conduct.

Accessible to Board members and employees of the Group as well as its agents, representatives and consultants, the 

principles and standards in the Code are intended to enhance investor confidence and rapport, and to ensure that decision-

making is ethically and properly carried out in the best interests of the Group. The Code is reviewed from time to time and 

updated to reflect changes to the existing systems or the environment in which the Group operates.

The Code  sets  out  principles  to guide  employees  in  carrying  out their duties and  responsibilities  to the highest  

standards  of  personal and corporate integrity when dealing with fellow employees; customers; competitors; suppliers; 

government agencies and officials; and the community  in  general.  Among others, key areas covered by the Code include 

workplace health and safety; workplace and business conduct; safeguarding of assets of the Group and other parties; 

handling of confidential information and trading policy; conflict of interest; personal data obligations; and compliance with 

laws including a whistle blowing policy. The Group has developed compliance education as part of the regular education 

programmes it administers. Under these programmes, employees are briefed on this Code and other compliance- related 

issues, either on its own or with the support of corporate function departments.

Governance Structure

Sustainability Governance is led by the Board of Directors and supported by all levels of the Group. Sustainability is a journey.  

The Board, with the assistance of Audit Committee, will ensure that we have the right policies and practices in place, with 

appropriate targets and measurements developed, and sufficient resources dedicated to sustainability-related initiatives. We 

will progressively strengthen the sustainability governance structure so that there is clear accountability and oversight.

Our major suppliers are the manufacturers of our Stainless Steel Distribution Business. Our suppliers are selected based 

on, amongst others, experience, expertise, product quality and past performances.  We have a Procurement Policy and ISO 

standard in place which provides procurement guidelines such as selection and evaluation of suppliers as well as ensuring 

adequate diversification of suppliers which results in cost-effectiveness and prevention of operational disruptions.

We generally do not enter into long term exclusive agreements with any of our suppliers as we value the flexibility to 

evaluate and select our suppliers in accordance with our aforementioned criteria.

Our Directors believe that our business and profitability are not materially dependent on any industrial, commercial or 

financial contract with any supplier and will not be materially affected by the loss of any single supplier.

Risk Management

The Group ensures that a rigorous procedure is in place to adequately and effectively manage risks faced by its business 

divisions during the course of daily operations and long-term business planning. This is done by holding Senior Management 

meetings on a regular basis.

On a quarterly basis, the Senior Management will provide updates to the Board in areas of concern, if any, that may arise in 

relation to the Group’s key risks factors.

In addition, the Group has also requested its internal auditors, to take such risk factors into consideration when drawing up 

the annual internal audit plan, so as to review and monitor the identified risk areas. In the event that the Group intends to 

enter into any new markets, business venture or business sector, the Group may also appoint external professional parties to 

review or advise on additional areas of risk factors to consider in connection with such forays.  

In order to ensure that it stays current and in compliance with applicable and relevant law and standards and/ or 

requirements issued by regulators, the Group tracks regulatory developments on a regular basis.

The Group’s Company Secretary, Corporate Lawyer, Sponsor and Auditors advise the Board on changes  in legal and 

regulatory issues while its external auditors provide changes in accounting standards to management for their consideration. 

The Group has engaged its external auditors to conduct at least one briefing per annum for the Board on changes in 

accounting standards.

To better manage compliance risk oversight, the Audit Committee has requested its internal auditors to  assist the 

Management in evaluating and assessing the effectiveness of internal controls implemented by the Company to identify risks 

of non- compliance in various areas. As part of its human resource practices, the Group ensures employee benefits are in 

place and healthcare insurance is taken out for eligible employees.

Overall compensation and benefits structure also follows closely to the basic requirements at the Ministry of Manpower 

(“MOM”), and the Group keeps itself abreast through regular updates from MOM.

Whistle Blowing Policy

The Company has implemented relevant procedures, as approved by the Audit Committee and adopted by the Board, for 

the purposes of handling complaints, concerns or issues relating to activities or affairs of the business, customers, suppliers, 

partners or associates, activities or affairs of the Group or conduct of any employee, officer or Management of the Group. 

Staff of the Group has access to the Audit Committee Chairman and may, in confidence and on an anonymous basis, raise 

concerns about possible improprieties in any such corporate matters by sending an email or a letter in writing to the Audit 

Committee Chairman.

Operational Risk

Financial Risk

Operational risks are managed on an ongoing basis. As the Group’s business is generally space-intensive by nature, the 

Group’s supply chain management is handled by the adequate sourcing of accredited suppliers as well as regular and 

effective management planning of its inventory stock and costs.

As part of its human resource efforts to add quality people to its workforce and retain its valued employees, the Group has 

implemented training and developed rigorous health and safety management programmes. The Group also provides highly 

incentivised working benefits which include insurance, medical and dental coverage.

The Group also has a robust Sales, Marketing and Communication strategy in place to ensure its message to stakeholders 

are aligned and it delivers on its sales targets. To achieve this, it has a sales strategy based on regular management review 

and communication with customers.

The Group monitors customer satisfaction upon conclusion of projects. The Group actively seeks to reduce its operational 

impact on the environment, and has stringent corporate responsibility and sustainability practices to manage its industrial 

waste by recycling and reusing where possible and engaging licensed waste collectors. To safeguard its legal interests, the 

Group hires professionals such as lawyers to provide professional advice in relation to operational risks.

For continuous operations, the Group’s IT infrastructure is handled by IT professionals to ensure system reliability compliant 

with stringent security measures to prevent information leaks or losses. In addition, the Group’s inventories are protected by 

adequate insurance covering all industrial risks in addition to its utilisation of on-site security device.

To mitigate its liquidity risks, the Group employs a tight capital management system to ensure it has sufficient working 

capital to meet debt obligations and pays close attention to critical financial ratios such as inventory turnover, accounts 

receivable/payable, gearing and current ratio for the early detection of red flags. Information on the Group’s Key 

Performance Indicators and ratios are reported quarterly to the Board.

To remain resilient amidst changing and increasingly diverse customer demands and an uncertain global economy, the 

Group constantly keeps itself abreast of market conditions, and stays close to its customers through regular visits and 

tracking of their purchasing patterns. This is to ensure right stock inventories are kept and is relevant to its existing and 

potential customers.

The Group also has a stringent credit policy that covers credit evaluation, approval and monitoring, as a safeguard to 

minimise all credit risks. In anticipation of unforeseen financial losses, the Group is insured in relation to the following: 

workmen compensation; product liability; directors and executive officers’ liability; industrial risks; marine insurance; 

vehicles insurance; trade credit insurance; as well as travel, health and personal accidents insurance for the Group.

The Board is satisfied with management approach towards identification and prioritisation of material topics and has 

provided resources to manage the governance of sustainability.

We conducted a high-level benchmarking exercise on a universe of topics to shortlist the key topics where our company 

created significant economic, environmental and social impacts. We took into consideration the material topics and 

future challenges of our industry as identified by our peers and competitors. This include relevant laws, regulations and 

international agreements of strategic significance to our Group.

Our material issues are identified based on the significance of economic, environmental, social impacts and the degree 

of influence they have on stakeholder assessments and decisions. We develop our material topics through stakeholder 

feedback, new trends in sustainability, challenges facing the industries and our own business goals. We therefore focus our 

sustainability efforts and reporting on these issues.

The Group will implement and formulate quantitative a targets on each of the identified factors in phases.
