MESSAGE FROM BOARD 

BOARD STATEMENT 

 

Dear Stakeholders, 

Huan Hsin Holdings Limited has continued to produce its third SR and we believe that sustainability is 

integral in our business strategies that have a direct and indirect impact on our overall business 

successes.  

In our sustainability reporting journey, we have established various responsible business practices to 

promote long-term sustainability solutions. In line with our sustainability vision to improve the 

economic, environmental, and social well-being of the communities, we reinforce our sustainability 

commitment from year-to-year for the best results.  

We believe employees are important throughout our business functions. Hence, we uphold fair 

employment principles by providing equal opportunities and care for our employees’ welfare.  In 

FY2019, our employee turnover rate has decreased to 10% as compared to 12% in FY2018.  We are 

proud to maintain good progress in retaining our workforce within the organisation. 

As we recognise that sustainability trends in business sectors are always changing for greater ESG 

impact, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company takes into consideration sustainability 

issues as part of the strategic formulation as they pursue business growth. 

As we progress ahead to FY2020, we pledge in continuing our efforts to improve our ESG performance 

and proactively integrate sustainable practices into our business strategies.

engaged and conducive working environment for all our employees. We believe in a skilled workforce

Hence, we strive to equip our employees with career development opportunities through training. We

EMPOWERING OUR EMPLOYEES  

We believe in investing the right resources to maximise overall business productivity and manufacture 

products with the highest quality while we care for our employees’ career development. We provide 

our employees with training and education to enhance their capabilities at carrying out their respective 

roles. As part of integrating responsible business practices, we continue to deliver education 

programmes related to workplace safety and responsible energy consumption to all our employees.   

We trust that good teamwork translates to better working conditions for all our employees; hence, we 

include teambuilding activities to instill values on cohesiveness. These activities bring together 

employees from all levels and it allows understanding each other well as we tailor the leadership styles 

that managers should adopt in managing their employees.  

As the industry is actively evolving and market competitiveness is increasing, employees need to 

continue improving their skills. In FY019, we pledged to roll out training programmes for high-

performing individuals with leadership potential to advance them to the next level. At Huan Hsin, we 

support progressive skill enhancement and encourage our employees to attend career development 

programmes to perform their roles to their fullest potential further.  

In FY2019, 68 employees from all categories, including managerial, executive, and non-executive 

have received the training we have trained which is higher compared to 33 employees who are trained 

in FY2018. [102-8]

ENVIRONMENT 

OUR APPROACH 

We care for our impact on the environment and aware of recent sustainability trends within the 

manufacturing industry. Positive ESG impact remains as our core priority in our business operations. 

We are proud to be an ISO 14001 certified company and we have company policies on mitigating 

environmental risks, which is documented in our Environmental, Health and Safety Manual. At Huan 

Hsin, we continue to advocate and encourage all our employees including Board members to read, 

understand, and uphold the highest integrity to promote best practices in managing or reducing 

environmental impact.  

All our potential suppliers are also expected to adhere to The Environmental Health and Safety Manual. 

In ensuring we conduct our business responsibly in our supply chain, all suppliers must meet the strict 

set of environmental criteria that we set. We look forward to engaging suppliers who demonstrate a 

strong commitment to the sustainable supply chain. [103-1, 103-2, 103-3] 

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE 

We regularly analyse the current law trends concerning environmental compliance in countries we 

operate. To stay ahead of ever-evolving environmental compliance demands, we have designed and 

rolled-out environmental management mechanisms, emergency plans, and environmentally-safe work 

procedures. We strive to monitor our mechanism from time to time.  We aspire to maintain this level 

of performance through continued policy adherence and by aligning it to current environmental 

compliance industry trends. [307-1] 

 

ENERGY 

As we recognise, that energy consumption is the key issue of concern, we embrace practices that are 

more environmentally friendly, such as improving energy efficiency in our business operation. We 

regularly raise awareness among our employees to be mindful of their actions to reduce energy 

consumption. For instance, employees periodically remind each other to switch off their equipment when 

not in use or been away from their respective workstations for a long time. We keep tracking our energy 

consumption level every week by assigning our managerial staff to run regular monitoring and strict 

inspections at workstations.  

We continue to align our efforts and initiatives to our goal to reduce energy consumption by having 

regular monitoring initiatives in place. The measures that we take on enable us to achieve greater 

energy efficiency that reduces the overall operational costs.  

The below charts show the detailed breakdown of our energy consumption statistics.

Figure 5: Energy Consumption (kWh) 

Our total energy consumption for 2019 was recorded at 1,410,632 kWh shows a decreasing trend 

from January 2019 to December 2019. 

Looking ahead, we have plans to roll out more initiatives to reduce our energy consumption in years 

to come. We regularly conduct training on energy consumption topic. We continued to update our 

posters in employees’ workstations on the benefits of conserving energy and timely reminders on 

responsible practices. We are in the process of establishing an Energy Management Policy to regulate 

energy usage per employee based on their duties 

[103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 302-1] 

SUPPLIER ASSESSMENT 

In ensuring the highest integrity of our suppliers, we assess our potential suppliers. We embrace 

responsible practices in including relevant environmental standards in our supplier contracts. The 

environmental standards include compliance with current environmental laws and regulations and the 

impact of supplier’s products and services including transporting operations to the environment.  

The Environmental Health and Safety Manual outlines employees’ roles and responsibilities in detail, 

to start the assessment process for potential suppliers. The process includes creating new supplier’s 

files and detailed evaluation of suppliers’ choice of material for product manufacturing. This process 

is crucial for Huan Hsin to uphold responsible practices for improved safety and environmental 

compliance.  

In FY2019, we have onboarded 11 new suppliers, drawing our total number of suppliers to 171 and 

all of our new suppliers were assessed based on our company’s environmental standards. We have 

established standard procedures to ensure all new and potential suppliers are carefully assessed upon 

onboarding.
