SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020 

 

 

The Board of Directors of the Company (“Board”) wishes to announce that the Company will not be 

issuing a sustainability report for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 (“FY2020”), and will be 

applying to the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) for a waiver from 

compliance with Rules 711A and 711B of the Listing Manual in relation to the issuance of the 

sustainability report for FY2020 (the “Application”).     

The waiver is sought as the Company has completed the disposal of the entire business and business 

assets of the Company on 21 October 2020 (the “Disposal”), and as a consequence of the Disposal, 

the Company has ceased to have any operating business and has become a cash company as 

defined under Rule 1018 of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST. As such, the Company takes the view 

that it would not be relevant or meaningful for the Company to prepare and issue a sustainability 

report for FY2020.  

Further information on the Application and its outcome will be announced in due course. 

 

By order of the Board
