BUSINESS EXCELLENCE AND ETHICS 

[GRI 102-11, 102-16, 205-3] 

Enterprise Risk Management 

The Group has an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM

ERM

ERM

ERM”) policy that safeguards the 

stakeholders’ interest. This sound system of risk management determines the nature and 

extent of the significant risks which the Group is willing to take in achieving our strategic goals. 

The policy is aligned to ISO 31000: 2009, the international standards on ERM with the 

objectives of meeting the compliance in the design, implementation and monitoring of the ERM 

and internal control systems in place. The Group has developed and implemented the 

appropriate risk management procedures to address the key risks identified. All significant 

matters will be highlighted to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company. 

Whistle Blowing Policy 

Sinjia engages in responsible business practices and complies with the relevant laws and 

regulations that address bribery and corruption. A Whistle Blowing Policy has been 

implemented to provide employees of the Group with an independent and confidential channel 

to report suspected fraud, corruption, dishonest practices or irregularities. The policy 

encourages the reporting of such matters by employees on an anonymous basis. The Group is 

confident of the policy’s effectiveness as reports by employees can be made confidentially and 

easily via e-mail. 

 

At the same time, such reporting will also be in compliance with applicable laws and the 

employees will not be penalised.  

 

Details of the Whistle Blowing Policy are disseminated to all employees of the Group and 

reminders are circulated to all existing employees and new employees on a semi-annual basis. 

There were no incidents of bribery and/or corruption reported during the year.

OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY 

[GRI 102-18, 42, 46] 

 

We conducted our first materiality assessment in 2017 with reference to the GRI Standards to 

identify and select stakeholders with whom to engage and determine the EESG factors that are 

material to them. We conducted a Focus Group Discussion with our very own Sustainability 

Reporting Champion Team (“Team”) to validate the assessment and gather feedback on the 

sustainability issues that are important to these key stakeholders. The results of the discussion 

still deemed the key stakeholder groups and material factors relevant and hence, they remain 

unchanged. We will continue to assess the identified material factors on a regular basis to 

ensure their relevance. We analysed our operations and adopted a 4-step approach (shown 

below) in determining the material EESG factors that are material to our stakeholders.  

 

 

 

Sinjia addressed the issues at hand by following the 4-step process listed above. We studied 

these EESG risks and their potential impacts to gain a comprehensive overview of mitigation 

approaches. Through the above four steps, Sinjia is able to gain an understanding of the issues 

that matter most to our key stakeholders. We then earmarked material factors and assessed 

their materiality with regards to our business operations, with reference to the respective GRI 

standards.  

 

We have our very own Team who evaluated these material factors with reference to the GRI 

Standards. Thereafter, the Team worked with the relevant departments to execute the 

strategies and action plans upon the approval by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and 

Board of Directors.   

 

Sinjia is committed to improving the identification and management of material issues relevant 

to our stakeholders.

RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS OUR ECONOMY 

[GRI 102-9, 203-2, 204-1] 

Our indirect economic impact 

The Singapore tourism sector continues to attain record highs in Tourism Receipts (“TR”) and 

International Visitor Arrivals (“IVA”). From January to November 2018, IVA increased 6.6% over 

the same period last year to reach 16.9 million visitors. TR for the first two quarters of 2018 also 

grew 4% over the same period to reach S$13.3 billion. The growth in 2018 TR came on the 

back of higher expenditure across components including sightseeing, entertainment and 

gaming. Gazetted hotel room revenue from January to November 2018 was reported at  

S$3.7 billion, a year-on-year growth of 8.3%. 

 

Accommodation is one of the basic needs for any tourism activity. As a hostel service provider, 

we recognised the importance of providing good services as the level of hospitality helps in 

building the image and market of Singapore. We work with the Singapore Tourism Board 

(“STB”) to drive strategic alignment towards the development of a vibrant and innovative hotel 

sector.  We promote the different places of interests in Singapore by displaying the various 

Singapore attractions brochures at our Hostel lobby. Additionally, we frequently provide advice 

to our guests and assist them with the booking of tickets and tours over our reception counter. 

It is, however, impracticable for us to quantify the indirect economic impact arising from such 

activities.  

 

We will continue to display Singapore attractions brochures to help further promote tourism in 

Singapore.

RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS OUR ECONOMY 

[GRI 102-9, 203-2, 204-1] 

Our procurement practices 

Sinjia is committed to building a sustainable supply chain which promotes value for both the 

Group and our suppliers. Our supply chain consists of vendors based in Singapore. Our 

vendors provide us with energy, water, laundry and pest control services. Local on-site 

procurement gives Sinjia many advantages over the supply chain of the business. Local 

suppliers are able to deliver products and services with shorter lead time and lower cost. Face 

to face meetings with our suppliers allows us to address any concerns that we might have and 

maintain greater control over the standard and quality of products and services provided to us. 

We aim to continue our local procurement practices moving forward. 

 

One of the key service providers involved in our supply chain are the online travel agents. We 

work closely with 6 main travel booking agents known to many such as Agoda, Booking.com, 

Expedia, Hotels.com, Traveloka and Airbnb. 

 

 








 

 

 

 

10 

RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS OUR ENVIRONMENT 

[GRI 302-1, 3, 303-1, 307-1] 

 

Sinjia understands that being a successful hostel service provider requires the Group to be 

efficient, well managed and customer focused. On top of these, Sinjia needs to fulfil the 

expectations of our stakeholders, which includes demonstrating our commitment to preserving 

the environment. We did not identify any non-compliance with environmental laws and 

regulations during the reporting period. 

Our energy consumption 

Each guest room requires non-renewable energy sources in the form of electricity, which is 

powered by electricity distributors. These include air-conditioning, lighting and heating.

During the reporting period, the Hostel has consumed a total of 129,000 kWh of electricity and 

has an occupancy of 18,751 guest nights. On average, each Hostel guest consumes 6.88 kWh 

of energy per guest night, which represents a 21% decrease in the consumption of energy per 

guest night. 

 

While the comfort of our guests is a key element during their stay, we abide by our Group’s 

energy saving policies whenever possible. We display notices in the room and within the Hostel 

to remind our Hostel guests to switch off the air-conditioning and lights whenever they are not 

in use. We also play our part in reducing our carbon footprint by utilising sensors and controls 

to adjust the lighting and other systems, such that they are automatically switched on when 

motion is detected. 

 

The reduction of energy consumed reflects the effectiveness of the Group’s energy saving 

policies. The Group will continue to monitor its energy consumption and take extra steps to 

reduce the energy intensity ratio per guest night.

RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS OUR ENVIRONMENT 

[GRI 302-1, 3, 303-1, 307-1] 

Our water consumption 

Water is a scarce resource in Singapore. As the demand for water continues to increase in 

tandem with population and economic growth, we have seen an increase in the hostel’s water 

consumption.

A total of approximately 2,192,000 litres of potable water was obtained from the local municipal 

water supplies during the reporting period. That translates to the equivalent of 117 litres of water 

use per guest night, which represents a 16% reduction in consumption per guest night.  

 

Hostel guests are also given complimentary bottles of water for their personal consumption. 

We noted an overall increase in the water consumption at our Hostel, which is in tandem with 

the increase in the number of guest nights during the year. However, through our water 

conservation efforts, we see a fall in the average water consumption per guest night.  

 

As the pressure on water resources increases, it is important to reduce and conserve water 

resources. Sinjia recognises the importance of water and is constantly finding ways to reduce 

water consumption in the Hostel. We hang signs around the pantry and bathrooms to remind 

all our guests to turn off the tap when not in use. This is also to encourage Hostel guests to 

reduce their water consumption where possible.  

 

At Sinjia, we are committed to save and conserve in every small way that we can to reduce our 

water consumption. Our water saving policies have been effective in reducing the average 

consumption per guest night. Moving forward, we seek to keep the water consumption per 

guest night below 120 litres. 

 

  


 

 

 

 

12 

RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS OUR PEOPLE 

[GRI 102-7 to 8, 41, 401-1-, 404-3, 405-1, 406-1] 

 

 

Our employees play an important role in our business and we are committed to creating a 

positive environment for the physical and mental well-being of our employees. This includes 

the overall job satisfaction which keeps our retention rate high; an inclusive and non-

discriminatory culture which forms a safe working space; a fair and open environment for 

continuous career development; and a safe working environment for all employees.  

 

A significant portion of the Group’s activities (i.e. the Hostel operations) are performed by Hostel 

workers through an outsourcing arrangement with HLN Rubber Products Pte. Ltd. and is 

included as part of our total headcount for the purpose of this Report. Our employees are not 

covered under any collective bargaining agreements. Directors and management will be 

reviewing the outsourcing arrangement with the objective to minimise its cost and maximise its 

returns.    

Our workforce retention rate 

The Group’s strategy in maintaining our high retention rate involves raising the overall well-

being of our employees. We have in place certain benefits for our employees who require 

additional support.  

 

Employees will be granted flexible working arrangements based on their individual parental or 

elderly care responsibilities. Sinjia considers the circumstances that may be relevant to 

determine whether a refusal is or is not reasonable. 

 

Sinjia also allows a pregnant employee to transfer to a ‘safe job’ without any change in her 

original employment terms. In the event where the employee cannot be transferred to a ‘safe 

job’, she will be required to take ‘no safe job’ leave for the time stated in the medical certificate 

or until the pregnancy ends. ‘No safe job’ leave is a special type of paid leave as agreed which 

can be no lower than 30% of the employee’s original base pay. 

 

We strongly believe that such benefits show our employees that Sinjia cares about their overall 

well-being and wants to ensure that they are happy and satisfied with their working 

environment.

that the rates were kept low due to the favourable human resource policies put in place. We 

aim to keep our employee turnover rate low as it eliminates the need for re-training of 

employees. Moving forward, we seek to keep the hiring rate and turnover rate below 15% and 

10% respectively.

[GRI 102-7 to 8, 41, 401-1-, 404-3, 405-1, 406-1] 

 

Our diverse workforce 

Our diversity is not limited to our employees but also our board of directors. Our directors come 

from different age groups and backgrounds which helps to foster innovation. Our experienced 

directors brings about stability and security while the younger directors contribute by 

introducing new ideas and methods to better manage the Group strategically. 

 

The Board comprises of 4 male directors, of whom 2 fall under the age group 30 - 50 years old 

and 2 other above 50 years old. Although there is currently no female Director appointed to the 

Board, the Board does not rule out the possibility of appointing a female Director if a suitable 

candidate is nominated for the Board’s consideration. We believe in continually creating an 

inclusive and supportive environment for all our employees.  

 

We are committed to providing a workplace free from discrimination, sexual harassment and 

bullying. Such conduct will not be tolerated and will lead to action being taken, which may 

include dismissal. There were no incidents of discrimination during the reporting period.

RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS OUR PEOPLE 

[GRI 102-7 to 8, 41, 401-1-, 404-3, 405-1, 406-1] 

Developing our employees 

Sinjia believes in nurturing our employees so that they not only meet and exceed their personal 

career goals, but also perform to their best. Personal growth of employees would lead to 

improved organisational performance. Emphasis is placed on feedback from employees as the 

management believes that such appraisals improve organisational efficiency. This two-way 

communication creates an effective environment for employees to discuss career goals and 

formulate plans to get one step closer to meeting these goals. 

 

In 2017, only our employees based at Sinjia’s head office, were subject to annual performance 

review to discuss their job performance and career goals. The remaining employees based at 

the Hostel did not undergo such annual performance review. However, in 2018, all employees 

went through the performance appraisal exercise. We intend to continue this practice moving 

forward. 

 

Health and safety of our employees 

The health and safety of our employees is of paramount importance to us. We believe that 

everyone is responsible for ensuring health and safety at the workplace.  Our Occupational 

Health and Safety Policy involves the identification, assessment and control of existing and 

potential risks to employees so as to provide them with a safe and healthy working environment.

RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS OUR CUSTOMERS 

[GRI 416-2, 418-1, 419-1] 

 

Singapore is a multi-racial and multi-religious society. Our Hostel staff are aware of our anti-

discriminatory guidelines and treatment towards our Hostel guests. We strongly believe in the 

gathering of people from different countries, race and religion to bring about new social 

opportunities.  

 

Apart from being socially responsible, we adhere to all relevant rules and regulations stipulated 

by the regulators from our industry. Under the Hotels Act (Section 16 – Penalties), a certificate 

of registration and a hotel-keeper’s license are required to manage a hostel. We have also 

obtained other relevant approvals and clearances from the fire safety department and the 

National Environment Agency. We did not identify any non-compliance with socioeconomic 

laws and regulations during the reporting period.    

Customer health, safety and privacy 

The health, safety and privacy of our Hostel guests are of utmost importance to us. We always 

strive to further improve and maximise our guests’ satisfaction.  

 

We have a regular pest control service provider who performs monthly pest control. The 

chemicals and methods used are almost zero toxicity to humans to ensure the comfort and 

safety of all our guests. Our service provider uses non-hazardous products which are safe for 

the environment. When the need to use hazardous products arises, they have the expertise to 

ensure the safety of our Hostel guests.  

 

Sinjia has a fire emergency evacuation plan in place to ensure that there is proper fire safety. 

The fire safety policy comprises of several fire safety precautions and facilities such as no 

smoking signs, a fire alarm system, a hose reel and an emergency escape route. There are 

CCTVs installed around the common areas of the Hostel to ensure the safety of all our guests 

without compromising their privacy.

RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS OUR CUSTOMERS 

[GRI 416-2, 418-1, 419-1] 

 

 

Customer health, safety and privacy 

Sinjia takes data privacy and security seriously and maintains all our customers’ data in a 

secure environment. Upon check-in, it is the Hostel’s procedure to gather the guest’s passport 

to obtain the particulars of the guest, according to the Hotels Act. We take the protection of our 

guests’ personal data very seriously and have procedures and guidelines in place with regards 

to the collection, use, disclosure, retention, security and disposal of personal information. We 

are committed to spreading awareness about the importance of data privacy and security 

across the Group. 

 

We also provide baggage deposit services located at the lobby specially for guests to deposit 

their luggage prior to check in or upon check out. The room is secured and is only accessible 

by the Hostel’s staff.  

 

Starting early 2019, the Group will keep a logbook record of all incidents relating to any 

accidents, loss or theft. This helps to track recurring incidents to identify weaknesses which can 

be improved upon. 

 

The above policies put in place have been effective in ensuring our guests’ health, safety and 

privacy. We did not identify any non-compliance with regulations or stipulated complaints with 

regards to the health, safety and privacy of our Hostel guests.
