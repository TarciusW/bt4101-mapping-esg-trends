B O A R D  S TAT E M E N T

As the Board of Directors (“Board”) of ESR Funds Management 

(S) Limited (“ESR-FM” or “Manager”), the Manager of ESR-

REIT (“REIT”), we are pleased to present ESR-REIT’s third 

sustainability report.

Formerly known as Cambridge Industrial Trust, ESR-REIT 

has been listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading 

Limited (“SGX-ST”) since 25 July 2006 and has grown its initial 

pool of 27 properties to a portfolio comprising 48 properties 

valued at S$1.681 billion as at 31 December 2017. In 2016, 

the REIT’s efforts in championing and upholding sustainable 

practices earned it a place on the SGX Sustainability Leaders 

Index as one of the pioneering constituents, a position 

that the REIT has continued to hold since. As ESR-REIT  

embarks on its next phase of growth, we believe that 

sustainability policies and initiatives will play an increasingly 

key role in the REIT’s overall business strategy.

We recognise that environmental, social and governance 

(“ESG”) issues are increasingly important to our stakeholders. 

Therefore, we are committed to managing relevant ESG 

risks and opportunities across our diversified portfolio. This 

will ensure the long-term resilience of our business while 

contributing positively to the environment and society, and at 

the same time, creating long-term value for our stakeholders. 

The Board oversees the sustainability management strategies 

of the Manager and is committed to incorporating sustainability 

into the organisation’s policies and practices. The Board 

has identified the organisation’s material ESG factors and 

ensures that issues relating to these factors are monitored 

and managed on a regular basis. The Board is supported by 

a Sustainability Committee that is responsible for leading 

sustainability initiatives at ESR-REIT. 

In the last year, the Manager has implemented various 

sustainability initiatives to reduce its environmental footprint. 

The Manager continued its solar panel programme and 

maintained solar panel installations at seven of its properties. 

As part of this programme, we harvested and used a total of 

1,560,748 kWh of solar energy. 

For the annual employee satisfaction survey, the Manager 

achieved an overall employee satisfaction score of 80%. For 

our annual tenant satisfaction survey 2017, the Manager 

achieved a satisfaction level of 72%.

Efforts were also made to improve the efficiency of ESR-

REIT’s properties, with 30 Toh Guan Road obtaining a renewal 

of the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”) Green 

Mark certification, and four other properties receiving Water 

Efficient Building (“WEB”) certification.  

We look forward to the exciting journey that lies ahead of us 

as we continue to create sustainable value for both ESR-REIT 

and our stakeholders.

To ensure that sustainability is incorporated into  

ESR-REIT’s strategies, policies and practices, a 

Sustainability Committee was established to integrate 

sustainability into the REIT’s day-to-day operations. 

Guided by the Board of Directors, the Sustainability 

Committee implements, executes and monitors policies 

and procedures across the organisation and is also 

responsible for the annual sustainability reporting process.

ESR-REIT considers its sustainability performance in the 

context of its business objectives and benchmarks itself against 

industry peers in order to identify areas for improvement. The 

Sustainability Committee reviews the Manager’s approach to 

the REIT’s operations, investments and projects on a regular 

basis to evaluate if current policies and measures are adequate 

to improve the REIT’s future performance so that remedial 

actions can be taken to address any gaps.

In FY2016, the Sustainability Committee conducted a 

materiality session to identify ESG factors that were material 

to ESR-REIT’s business operations and of significant interest 

to our stakeholders. As the REIT embarks on its next growth 

phase, a second session was conducted towards the end of 

FY2017 to review and recalibrate the material ESG factors 

that were earlier identified. The following factors were taken 

into consideration for the materiality assessment:

• global and local emerging sustainability trends

• material topics identified by industry peers

• sustainability frameworks

Following the review session, a decision was made to 

streamline the number of material factors from nine to 

six, reflecting the critical opportunities and risks faced by  

ESR-REIT in view of its current growth strategy. The material 

ESG factors identified in FY2017 were as follows:

Stakeholder engagement remains a priority for the Manager. 

As part of on-going efforts to improve how the Manager 

engages with its stakeholders, ESR-FM has identified six key 

stakeholder groups that are critical to ESR-REIT’s business 

and have significant impact on the REIT’s long-term business 

strategy and performance. The Manager aims to build positive 

and lasting relationships with its stakeholders by engaging 

with them on a regular basis to understand the issues that 

concern them.

TARGETS

•  Invest in properties that will enhance the sub-asset class diversity of ESR-REIT’s portfolio

•  Achieve a portfolio occupancy rate that exceeds Jurong Town Corporation’s (“JTC”) Industrial 

occupancy average

RESPONSIBLE INVESTING AND QUALITY OF 

ASSETS AND SERVICES

Responsible investing principles are a key pillar of ESR-

REIT’s real estate strategy and investing in good quality, 

yield-accretive assets is key to building a portfolio that will 

generate higher returns. These efforts will also reduce risks 

and create a more stable flow of income for the REIT and 

consequently produce steady and recurring distributions for 

Unitholders. The Manager seeks opportunities to acquire and 

invest in assets that will diversify and rebalance the REIT’s 

portfolio, while simultaneously improving the properties 

through active asset management and AEIs. 

Eco-friendly certifications are considered an important 

indicator of building quality and correlate strongly to positive 

returns on investments and high levels of tenant satisfaction. 

The Manager is committed to achieving green property 

certifications — such as the BCA Green Mark and Leadership 

in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) certifications 

— for both new developments and existing properties.

Various AEIs are carried out to improve the overall quality of 

properties including the enhancement of building façades, 

lift modernisation works and landscape improving projects 

carried out within the common spaces of the REIT’s properties. 

Several policies have been implemented to maintain the 

quality of ESR-REIT’s assets and services. These include 

policies on investments and divestments of property, credit 

control tests, credit evaluations and quality assessments for 

major vendors and suppliers.

Details on ESR-REIT’s investment portfolio can be found 

in the Property Details (pages 36 to 45) and the Investment 

Properties Portfolio Statement (pages 104 to 115) sections 

of the FY2017 Annual Report.

ENERGY AND CARBON EMISSIONS

TARGETS

•  Achieve 5% saving in energy consumption of multi-tenanted buildings (“MTB”) over a  

five-year period from 2016 to 2020 or reduce the energy consumption by 10% as compared 

to FY2017  

•  Reduce energy intensity by 2% per year

•  Use 100% renewable power at all locations where it is available by 2020

•  Achieve a basic level of environmental certification for all buildings e.g. BCA Green Mark

• Maintain no incidents of non-compliance with environmental regulations and laws

The Manager recognises that reducing the REIT’s environmental 

footprint can improve business and operational efficiency and 

reduce costs while providing a conducive work environment 

for both tenants and staff. The usage of environmentally-

friendly business practices is likely to also position the REIT 

in a positive light amongst its tenants and investors. 

An increase in energy consumption will lead to higher carbon 

emissions, which in turn contributes towards global warming. 

Singapore is taking steps to reduce its carbon emissions and 

strives to reduce its emissions intensity by 36% from year 

2005’s levels by year 2030. 

The Manager strives to reduce its carbon emissions output by 

improving the energy performance and efficiency of the REIT’s 

properties. Utilities consumption patterns are tracked and 

monitored on a monthly basis to ensure ESR-REIT’s operations 

are as energy efficient as possible. Various environmentally-

friendly practices and initiatives have been implemented over 

the years to reduce the energy consumption of ESR-REIT 

properties. These measures include:

• Replacing staircase lighting with LED lighting at 30 Toh 

Guan Road 

• Replacing basement carpark lighting with T5 lighting 

with motion sensors at 2 Jalan Kilang Barat

• Undertaking lift modernisation works at 3C Toh Guan 

Road East and 128 Joo Seng Road

• Upgrading the water chiller system at 21/23 Ubi Road 1

• Equipping seven of ESR-REIT’s properties with solar 

energy harvesting facilities

In FY2017, the Manager has also increased its efforts to improve 

the efficiency of the REIT’s properties. However, the ongoing 

conversions of single-tenanted properties to multi-tenanted 

buildings have made it challenging to compare electricity and 

carbon emissions generated on a like-for-like basis.

The BCA Green Mark certification for 30 Toh Guan Road was 

renewed, bringing the total number of BCA-certified buildings 

in ESR-REIT’s portfolio to five. The Manager also aims to 

attain BCA Green Mark certification for all its buildings that 

undergo AEIs.

In line with Singapore’s efforts towards water conservation, 

the Manager has embarked on water efficiency initiatives 

to achieve WEB certification for all the upgraded 

toilets in ESR-REIT’s properties. In FY2017, WEB 

certification was awarded for four of the REIT’s buildings 

– 120 Pioneer Road, 54 Serangoon North Avenue 4 and  

86 &amp; 88 International Road. This brings the total number of 

buildings within our portfolio with WEB certification to 12.

In FY2017, the Manager continued its solar panel programme 

and maintained solar panel installations at seven of its 

properties. As part of this programme, 1,560,748 kWh of 

solar energy was harvested.

levels. Energy intensity increased from 131 kWh/m2 in FY2016 

to 145 kWh/m2 in FY2017. This was due to the conversion of 

Single-Tenanted Buildings (“STB”) to MTBs in FY2017 which 

had increased the energy usage. However, as the conversions 

were completed progressively across the FY2017 period, the 

energy consumption data recorded for these buildings did 

not accurately reflect the total energy consumption of these 

buildings on a full-year basis.

Efforts are being made to reduce the REIT’s impact on climate 

change by increasing the use of alternative energy sources 

and driving energy efficiency across all properties. 

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Where possible, the Manager strives to comply with all 

applicable environmental laws and regulations and meet the 

requirements of approved standards and codes of practice. 

In FY2017, there were no reported cases of non-compliance 

with any environmental laws and regulations.

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 

The Manager is committed to building an inclusive workforce 

that embraces and promotes diversity and equal opportunity. 

Its commitment to workplace diversity is demonstrated 

through its Human Resource Management (“HRM”) policy and 

practices, which are aligned with the key principles defined 

by the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices 

(“TGFEP”) and the Ministry of Manpower’s Fair Consideration 

Framework. All of the Manager’s employees have an equal 

opportunity to succeed and all decisions relating to recruitment 

and promotion are based on merit.

TALENT ATTRACTION AND RETENTION

The recruitment and retention of the right talent is crucial 

to the Manager’s overall efforts to pro-actively identify and 

develop future leaders of the organisation.

A structured recruitment process has been implemented to 

ensure that right talent fit is achieved in order to drive the 

REIT’s business forward. All new employees are required to 

participate in a comprehensive orientation programme that 

covers topics such as ESR-REIT’s culture, health, safety and 

business practices.

A competitive compensation and employee benefits scheme 

is essential to attracting and retaining the best talent. This 

in turn supports the organisation in achieving its goals 

and creates sustained shareholder value. A remuneration 

framework has been established to ensure that remuneration 

for performance is competitive and in line with industry 

practice. All employees receive an annual performance review 

in which their supervisors discuss with them their strengths, 

skills and development needs.

Exit interviews are conducted to understand employees’ 

reasons for leaving the organisation. Through the interviews, 

feedback and comments are gathered from employees, 

allowing the Manager to identify areas for improvement. 

TARGETS

•  Maintain current levels of employee turnover and absenteeism

•  Increase employee satisfaction at all levels

TRAINING AND EDUCATION

All employees hired by the Manager are encouraged to seek 

out opportunities for professional and personal growth. 

Each employee is required to complete at least 20 hours 

of training every year and all employees are encouraged to 

participate in relevant workshops, seminars and courses to 

improve their skills and capabilities. Some of the training 

programmes/courses include Software Systems training, 

employee engagement seminars such as “Engaging Self and 

Others” and bi-monthly internal training courses to provide 

staff members with an overview of the company’s policies 

and regulations. For FY2017, each employee received an 

average of 33.6 hours of training.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND WELLNESS

Employee engagement is key to a motivated and successful 

workforce and employee engagement and satisfaction levels 

are closely monitored through an annual satisfaction survey, 

which covers the following topics: 

1. Commitment of Team Members 

2. Strength of the Line Managers

3. Team Spirit and Collaboration

4. Strategy and Leadership

In FY2017, an overall employee satisfaction score of 80% 

was achieved.

TENANT ENGAGEMENT AND SATISFACTION

Developing good tenant relationships enable the Manager 

to anticipate, understand and respond appropriately to the 

needs of the REIT’s tenants. This is achieved through regular 

communication, timely resolution of issues and progressive 

upgrading of facilities. 

The Manager regularly engages with the REIT’s tenants 

through periodic site visits, email correspondence, various 

events and the annual tenant satisfaction survey. In the Tenant 

Satisfaction Survey 2017, the overall tenant satisfaction 

achieved was 72%. Feedback gathered centred around the 

following aspects:

1. Service quality provided by various teams

2. Service provided by external vendors

3. Tenants’ environmental policies

Various benefits are provided to employees to support their 

mental and physical well-being. Flexible work arrangements 

are offered to employees to ensure that they are able to meet 

their personal or family commitments and be productive and 

happy in the workplace. 

The following benefits are also offered to employees: 

• Insurance Cover: Term Life, Personal Accident and 

Permanent Disability, Hospital and Surgical, Outpatient/

Specialist and Travel

• Flexi-benefits scheme

• Comprehensive leave entitlements, including birthday 

leave

• Annual team-building activities

Initiatives such as the “Helping Employees Achieve Lifetime 

Health” (“HEALTH”) Charter and the Physical and Mental 

Health Programme support the enhancement of employees’ 

social, mental and physical wellness. Employees are 

encouraged to participate in the HEALTH Programme, which 

includes activities such as exercises, health talks and an 

annual health screening event.

TARGETS

•  Improve tenant satisfaction levels across all benchmarks/levels (to achieve tenant 

satisfaction between 70 – 80 percent each year)

2016

Tenant Satisfaction Rating

73%

72%

Creating an environment that encourages tenant loyalty will 

encourage tenants to sign on for longer leases and in turn 

create a more robust tenant network. Tenant occupancy and 

retention rates are tracked on an annual basis and these 

rates are benchmarked against industry peers in order to 

identify areas for improvement.

COMMUNITY INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT

The Manager is committed to building long-term relationships 

with the communities in which it operates in by supporting 

efforts to improve living standards within the community.

Working responsibly also includes contributing back to the 

communities in which the Manager operates in, helping 

them to build the skills and support networks needed to 

create sustainable success. The Manager has also made 

contributions back to the local education system and provided 

financial support to outstanding students, while at the same 

time developing a pipeline of future talent in the real estate 

industry through the introduction of a Sponsorship Programme 

for Real Estate students of Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Cash and 

in-kind donations were also contributed by the Manager to 

benefit the wider community. 





ESR-REIT’s scholarship programme supports the development of new talent for the real estate sector. (From left to right):

ESR-REIT’s Scholarship Programme 

The scholarship programme aims to give outstanding students the opportunity to participate in internships and develop 

employability skills. The programme covers students’ annual tuition fees and book allowance. Recipients of the scholarship 

undertake a compulsory internship with ESR-REIT’s Manager. In this way, the contribution creates a direct impact on 

the community by helping deserving students afford higher education, fostering a new generation of industry talent and 

supporting the REIT’s business with a potential pipeline of talent. In FY2017, S$5,800 was allocated to this two-year 

programme and a student candidate from Ngee Ann Polytechnic was selected to be ESR-REIT’s inaugural scholar. 

Cash Contribution to Wishing Well

In FY2017, a donation of S$10,000 was made to Wishing Well, an organisation 

that supports low-income families in Singapore. The donation was used to 

support Wishing Well’s Groceries for Families and Children Enrichment 

Programmes that reach out to more than 120 beneficiaries. Groceries for 

Families is a programme that distributes grocery packs with household 

staples to beneficiary families across Singapore. Children Enrichment is a 

holistic programme that helps children build academic, team building and 

personal development skills.

Donation to Mercy Relief

A donation of 225 woven bags and 

approximately 100 zippered travel 

bags was made to Mercy Relief, 

Singapore’s leading independent 

disaster relief agency in FY2017. The 

donated items were used to support 

Mercy Relief’s local and overseas 

relief missions.

TARGETS

•  No reported lapses in corporate governance, corruption/employee misconduct 

and non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations

GOVERNANCE

The Manager believes that having a robust corporate 

governance framework in place can enhance stakeholders’ 

trust.

Importance is placed on protecting the REIT’s assets, its 

reputation and the value of Unitholders’ investment by adopting 

good corporate governance practices, which include abiding 

by all applicable legislation and regulations. The Manager 

adheres to the Code of Corporate Governance 2012, the 

Code on Collective Investment Schemes, the Trust Deed, 

listing rules and regulations set out by SGX, as well as other 

applicable laws and regulations.

Relevant regulatory related policies and procedures have been 

established to ensure compliance with applicable legislation 

and regulations. The Manager monitors compliance policies 

and procedures to ensure they are aligned with regulatory 

requirements through regular attestations, routine compliance 

monitoring programmes, reporting of regulatory breaches 

and internal/external/regulatory inspection findings. 

A formal process is also in place to annually assess the 

effectiveness of the Board and the Audit, Risk Management and 

Compliance Committee (“ARCC”). This is conducted through 

feedback collected from individual directors on areas relating 

to the Board’s and ARCC’s competencies and effectiveness. 

An assessment review on each independent director is 

conducted by the Nominating and Remuneration Committee 

(“NRC”) to ensure that the director remains independent. 

Results of the assessment will be submitted to the Board 

for review and approval. The performance and effectiveness 

of ESR-REIT’s internal and external auditors are monitored 

and assessed by the ARCC each year. 

A whistle-blowing policy is in place to provide an avenue for 

employees and external parties to raise any concerns about 

possible improprieties relating to matters of financial reporting 

or other issues to the Chairman of ARCC. An independent 

investigation and appropriate follow-up action will be taken 

in response to any concerns raised.

All suppliers and vendors are required to comply with 

applicable laws and regulations. A due diligence process 

is conducted on the suppliers and vendors at the point of 

engagement by the Manager on behalf of the REIT. Routine 

assessments of these suppliers and vendors are conducted to 

ensure compliance with the internally prescribed standards 

and applicable laws and regulations.  

Anti-corruption

The Manager maintains a zero-tolerance approach towards 

corrupt business practices and is committed to conducting 

business in an ethical manner. In FY2017, there were no 

reported cases of non-compliance with anti-corruption laws 

and regulations.

Anti-competitive Behaviour 

The Manager is committed to complying with all applicable 

anti-trust and competition laws and regulations. There were 

no legal actions with regard to anti-competitive behaviour and 

violations of anti-trust and competition laws and regulations 

during the reporting period. 

Enterprise Risk Management

The Manager has put in place a comprehensive risk 

management system that helps it identify, measure, prioritise 

and respond to potential risks that that could have a significant 

impact on the REIT’s business. The Manager adopts a four-

step risk management process to manage different risks and 

it includes the following steps:

1. Risk identification and assessment;

2. Risk management application;

3. Risk monitoring; and

4. Reporting

Information on ESR-REIT’s corporate governance, compliance 

and risk management policies and practices can be found 

in the Risk Management (pages 67 to 70) and the Corporate 

Governance Report (pages 71 to 91) sections of the FY2017 

Annual Report.
