also provides oversight of the management and monitoring of 

these material ESG factors, through periodic review of the key

MATERIALITY

We have conducted an assessment of the most significant

We plan to develop more specific targets for the relevant ESG 

factors in due course and will include the necessary information 

in our future sustainability reports.

Our sustainability approach is to conduct our business in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. Sustainability is infused 

right from the product development and design and choice of materials to production processes. We focus on managing the economic, 

social and environmental impacts of our operations and take into consideration the expectations of our key stakeholders. We also 

actively work with our trade customers to understand and to respond to their sustainability priorities.

Safety and health of our people at workplace is one of our top priorities. We are committed to hiring, developing and retaining the best

HEALTH AND SAFETY

Versalink is committed to be a responsible employer, were we provide a safe and healthy working environment for our employees and 

those whose work are under the control of Versalink. 

The Group is committed:

 

•  

To provide a safe and healthy working environment for all the workers

 

•  

To enhance the safety and health awareness among the workers and contractors towards 

 

 

safety practices within the company

 

•  

To avoid unintended incidents/accidents and meeting the applicable safety and 

 

 

health regulations

 

•  

To comply with the local safety and health regulations

We have implemented a health and safety management system aimed at prevention of risks by taking appropriate measures and 

adopting safe work practices. In our furniture manufacturing facilities, the potential health and safety issues arise from use of

machinery and tools, movement of bulky items, wood dust and chemical fume from spraying operations.

We provide the necessary personal protective equipment such as face masks, respiratory masks, safety glasses and safety gloves to 

employees engaged in manufacturing operations. Our facility employees receive regular training in operational safety. 

To minimize the health effects of wood dust, our facilities are fitted with dust collector system and local exhaust ventilation mechanisms. 

Spraying operations are conducted in a secure booth to minimize the health hazards. We ensure all machinery, tools and equipment 

remain in good working order through regular maintenance and periodic inspections.

We have implemented procedures to collect and monitor health and safety data including the injury rate, accident frequency rate, 

occupational disease rate and fatality rate.

CHEMICAL SAFETY

We carefully choose chemicals such as paints, resins, lacquers and solvents with lower led-content for our production processes to 

minimise the harmful effects on the health of our workers. We maintain Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all chemicals that are 

used in our production processes to ensure safety procedures are followed while handling these chemicals.

suppliers and the local communities.

Direct Economic Performance

A summarized version of our economic performance, obtained from the financial statement, is provided in the table below.

facilities. Employee wages and taxes contribute to the local economies.

suppliers to ensure they adhere to our social, environmental and quality standards. Our standard procedure for evaluating suppliers 

includes assessment of their compliance with our social and environmental criteria. The social and environmental indicators included 

in the supplier assessment include freedom of association, child labor, forced labor, non-discrimination, overtime, health and safety, 

minimum wage, environmental protection and anti- corruption.

Anti-Corruption

We require high ethical standards from our employees including the directors. We maintain zero tolerance against corruption, bribery, 

fraud and unethical conduct.

Our Employee Code of Ethics sets out the Group’s ethics policy that prohibits accepting or offering illegal payments or gifts. Employees 

are given a copy of the Code of Conduct and are required to acknowledge they have read and understood the Company’s ethics policy.
