ABOUT

THIS REPORT

As our fourth sustainability report (the “report”), we aim to disclose our Group’s sustainability policies, targets, 

KPIs and performance based on the identified material sustainability topics after conducting stakeholder 

engagement. 

Reporting Scope and Boundary

The report focuses on Luxking’s operations relating to the manufacturing and sales of BOPP films, IS tapes 

and general tapes (collectively referred to as the “Tapes”) for the financial year ended on 30 June 2021 (the 

“reporting year” or “FY2021”) within the manufacturing facility in Zhongshan managed by Luxking. For FY2021, 

we have expanded the reporting boundary to cover not only the production departments (i.e. FY2020 reporting 

boundary), but the entire Zhongshan manufacturing facility with all departments included. This expansion of 

reporting boundary helps us to disclose more sustainability performance data to our stakeholders that will 

facilitate them in better evaluating our overall sustainability disclosures both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Depending on future business priorities and data availability, we will continue to even further the scope of our 

sustainability disclosures in the coming reporting years.

The chart below shows the Group’s corporate governance structure with various departments:

Reporting Cycle

For reporting cycle, we publish our sustainability 

report annually as mandated by SGX-ST Listing Rules 

711A. We submit this report to SGX in a timely manner 

as part of our sustainability communication efforts. 

Readers may find this report digitally on the websites 

of both SGX and Luxking (www.newasiatapes.com).

Reporting Standards

The Group prepared this sustainability in accordance 

with the SGX-ST Listing Rules 711A and 711B on 

sustainability report, with implementation guidance 

as stipulated in the Practice Note 7.6: Sustainability 

Reporting Guide (“PN 7.6”) issued by the SGX. As 

with our previous reports, this sustainability report 

is developed with reference to the Global Reporting 

Initiative’s (“GRI”) latest international sustainability 

reporting framework, the GRI Standards (versions 

2016 and 2018). 

The Group continues to select the GRI Standards as 

its choice of sustainability reporting framework due 

to the following key reasons:

• 

Wide adoption globally in all sectors: there are 

over 10,000 GRI reporters in over 100 countries 

across many different industries for reporters 

of all organizational sizes. It remains the most 

common standard that allows easy comparison 

between our local, regional and global peers.

• 

A highly credible, robust and trustworthy set 

of standards: the GRI Standards have evolved 

and improved over the years under its Global 

Sustainability Standards Board and Stakeholder 

Council since its launch in 1997. Today, it still 

remains an independent organization and its 

standards are trusted by government agencies, 

regulators, financial institutions and civil society 

organizations alike.

ABOUT

THIS REPORT

• 

Convenient alignment with other international 

sustainability-related 

standards: 

GRI 

has 

robust and credible implementation guidelines 

on how to effortlessly align itself with various 

standards such as CDP, SASB, TCFD, IIRC, 

CDSB. In the meantime, GRI is working with 

the aforementioned five reporting organizations 

towards a comprehensive corporate reporting 

framework. This flexibility allows Luxking to 

align with these other frameworks, if necessary, 

in the future.

The disclosures in this report seek to achieve the 

GRI’s Reporting Principles for defining report quality: 

accuracy, balance, clarity, comparability, reliability, 

and timeliness. 

Readers may find the GRI-SGX Content Index, 

corresponding 

to 

the 

different 

topic-specific 

disclosures, at the end of this report for reference.

External Assurance

Luxking recognizes the importance and significance 

of adopting external assurance, namely imparting 

a higher credibility to report development and data 

gathering processes. As such, the Group continues 

to 

closely 

monitor 

the 

latest 

SGX-published 

consultations on potentially requiring issuers to adopt 

mandatory external assurance on sustainability 

reports. We would gradually adopt external assurance 

in the future as the sustainability reporting landscape 

evolves. 

Confirmation and Approval

Luxking’s Board of Directors and senior management 

have approved the scope and content of this 

sustainability report as of 1 November 2021.

BOARD

STATEMENT

In this challenging year, I am very pleased to report that 

the Group has prevailed against enormous hurdles 

and risen to new heights. Despite the persistent 

disruptions to our operations due to the COVID-19 

pandemic, the Group has increased revenue by 

27.6% across all of our business segments amidst 

gradual 

economic 

recovery. 

Beyond 

financial 

achievements, we have also done well attributing to 

quality sustainability disclosures.

Expansion of Reporting Scope

In this year’s sustainability report, we have 

improved on materiality analysis and stretched our 

sustainability reporting scope and data to include the 

entire Zhongshan manufacturing facility. We aspire to 

expand reporting coverage in the future as the Group 

continues to build the new plant in Hubei. Regarding 

material topics, we have structured the report to 

focus on various topics outlined in four sections 

- respectively entitled Responsible Operations, 

Developing Talents, Protecting Our People and 

Environmental Stewardship.

Sustainability Governance, Board Diversity and 

Anti-Corruption 

In terms of sustainability governance, the Board has 

the ultimate accountability in directing the strategic 

direction in embedding sustainability and climate 

resilience factors into our business operations.  

Beyond our effective sustainability governance 

structure, board diversity1 and enforcement of anti-

corruption policies are equally important to the Group 

as well as to alignment of requirements from SGX-ST. 

The Group takes into consideration of the benefits 

of various aspects of diversity, including gender, age, 

education background, professional experience and 

other factors that may be relevant from time to time 

towards achieving a diversified Board. 

Although anti-corruption has not been identified 

as a material factor in the report, it is an important 

pillar in our business strategy. Insofar, the Group has 

established several policies regarding conflict-of-

interest, employee conduct and whistle-blowing, in 

order to promote transparent business practices and 

conduct. 

Moving Forward with Confidence

In these perplexing yet exciting times, the market 

offers us new opportunities to capture, but we have to 

carefully manage sustainability risks simultaneously. 

The board thanks our management and employees 

who have worked together as a team to achieve 

greater 

sustainability 

performance 

in 

FY2021. 

Looking ahead, let us continue to work tirelessly 

towards becoming a more sustainable company.

SUSTAINABILITY 

GOVERNANCE







Luxking’s Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility for the business 

decision-making and sustainability directives of the Group. In terms of 

implementation, our management and departmental leaders work together 

to ensure sustainability measures and protocols are put in place so that our 

yearly targets can be effectively met. On the operational level at our factory, 

the Group has designated a general manager to lead the Environmental and 

Chemical Substance Management Committee.

SUSTAINABILITY RISKS 

AND OPPORTUNITIES

We believe that identifying and monitoring sustainability risks and opportunities is extremely important to the 

Group’s long term business and financial performance. This table depicts the varying sustainability risks and 

opportunities that have the potential to impact our long-term operations and strategy planning.

 





RISKS

OPPORTUNITIES RISKS

Economic Outlook

The pandemic continues to pose adverse impacts 

to our markets and impedes normal operations. 

Countries may continue to lock up borders and 

restrict travelling as the pandemic appears to not 

slowing down. Therefore, the global economic 

outlook remains uncertain and volatile.

The Group continues to closely monitor the 

pandemic situation, both globally and locally in 

the markets we operate. Integrating sustainability 

and ESG directions into our business decision-

making proves beneficial to value creation in the 

long run for our stakeholders. 

Luxking looks towards capturing arising 

opportunities that will enable us to do better as a 

responsible corporate citizen.

Occupational Health and Safety

The pandemic adds another layer of occupational 

health and safety risks to our frontline employees, 

in additional to operational work hazards in our 

factory. 

Work safety for our workers and employees is a key 

tenet in our operational management. The Group 

has dedicated managers to regularly monitor and 

review various safety management systems and 

protocols. Preemptively identifying potential risks 

and hazards would be key to prevent work-related 

incidents.

Talent Retention

The Group recognizes that a skilled and talented 

workforce is essential to our long term success. 

The challenge to retain valuable workers remains 

since the manufacturing industry faces high 

competition in the PRC. The pandemic further 

adds to the complication. The loss of skilled 

employees may disrupt daily operation and lead to 

high costs of replacement. 

We have established a long term employee 

development and talent management strategy. 

Our management conduct regular performance 

interviews with employees and career progression 

reviews. We provide not only financial incentives, 

but also opportunities to grow professionally and 

personally through training and team-building 

exercises alike. Cultivating a committed and 

passionate workforce is always our goal.

SUSTAINABILITY RISKS 

AND OPPORTUNITIES



Data Management

Robust customer and supplier data management 

is critical to our operations. As we process data on 

a daily basis, there are persistent risks associated 

with potential data leakage and breaches when 

cases of cyberattacks have gone up in recent 

times. In the case of a potential data breach, it 

may result in financial losses amidst other negative 

consequences and business disruptions.  

IT systems and infrastructure are closely guarded 

with additional security measures that only allow 

specified and authorized personnel to access. In 

terms of data management, we have implemented 

a classification system across our operations that 

informs the degree of access. As such, Luxking 

strives to protect and safeguard all confidential 

data, whether they belong to our customer, 

suppliers or business partners, to the best of our 

ability.

Environmental Impact

Our manufacturing facility bears the inherent 

environmental pollution risk. Additionally, climate 

change poses international and local environmental 

risks to us in the long term. Environmental risks 

could have social impacts that affect local 

communities and employees. Furthermore, these 

risks may damage our corporate brand reputation, 

and disturb customer and supplier relationships.

Our 

three 

main 

departments 

(production 

department, 

department 

of 

quality 

control 

and department of environmental safety) and 

the Environmental and Chemical Substance 

Management Committee are overseeing the 

negation of environmental and effluent pollution 

of our operations. We have multiple environmental 

management handbooks or guidance and a list 

of banned hazardous chemicals to ensure full 

adherence to local regulations and standards. The 

Group’s management is also actively evaluating 

energy-saving measures and alternative energy 

supply in order to plan out a more sustainable 

organization that works for the future.

RESPONSIBLE 

OPERATIONS

Fair Employment

Since our inception, Luxking has always defined a clear and straight-forward hiring policy for all of our 

employees. Internally, the Group has a set of standardized, step-by-step hiring protocols (i.e. Company 

Recruitment Guide) in which our recruiters and human resources managers have to adhere to when the 

company hires. Our management regularly review and update our hiring policy according to the latest local 

labour laws and standards so that our employees’ rights of fair employment are protected. The Company 

Recruitment Guide highlights that:

• 

We screen and verify all new job applicants with supporting documents to make sure they are qualified 

with no criminal record and over 18 year-old (not child labour).

• 

No discrimination is allowed as we base our hiring decisions on meritocracy alone.

• 

Stipulates the standard job probation period of 1 to 3 months, depending on position.

• 

Delineates the range of benefits offered to full-time staff, such as pension, medical insurance, 

unemployment insurance, work injury insurance, employer’s liability insurance2 and maternity insurance, 

in accordance with the requirements set out in the Labour Law of the PRC, the Social Insurance Law 

of the People’s Republic of China, Regulations on the National Social Security Fund (全国社会保障基

金条例), Regulations on Unemployment Insurance (失业保险条例) and Interim Measures on Employee 

Childbirth Insurance (企业职工生育保险试行办法).

Full Compliance with Labour Standards: Strictly No Child or Forced Labour

Any form of child labour is strictly prohibited by Luxking. Our recruiters observe guidelines in our Company 

Recruitment Guide to check and verify all identification documents of incoming job applicants as a preventive 

measure. Those who fail our age requirements are automatically rejected. Additionally, Luxking does not 

tolerate any employment of child labour beyond our own business operations, including our suppliers.

For our FY2020 sustainability report, we have set a specific target to extend our anti-child labour policy to 

all of our suppliers by this year. We have sent out over 41 supplier surveys of which 32 were returned to 

us (78%). All (100%) returned surveys confirmed with signature that they do not employ child labour4 but 

66% responded that they do not have a management system standard or guideline to abolish child labour. 

Although the Group is encouraged by the survey results, we would continue to urge all of our suppliers to 

establish a set of related anti-child labour policy standard or guideline in the near future.

Equivalently, no forced or compulsory labour is allowed in the Group. All employees of the Group’s 

operations are hired on a voluntary and fair basis. We have postulated that the standard working hours are 

8 hours per day. Luxking has maintained a Requirement on Restricting Overtime Hours (对加班时间的限制

性规定), under which any overtime arrangement requires prior mutual agreement between our employees 

and their supervisors, and employees would be subjected to proportionate compensation with leave or 

allowance. The Group has conducted an Employee Satisfaction Survey5 (员工满意度调查) in Q1 FY2021.

RESPONSIBLE 

OPERATIONS

The survey contained 15 questions classified by different categories, including compensation, job 

satisfaction, company culture, internal communication, respect given by management to employees, as well 

as understanding of management system and career progression. 13 out of 15 questions have achieved 

over a 90% score, indicating a high employee satisfaction. Employees also voiced out recommendations 

for improvements such as organizing further team-building activities and better food quality in the company 

canteen.

Customer Privacy

Luxking treats data protection and customer privacy issues very seriously, and have a host of preventive 

protocols and measures to deal with any data breach or cyberattack. Our approach to protecting customer 

privacy includes:

Human resources department and IT personnel would be notified and take subsequent remedial actions in an 

unfortunate event of suspected or actual data breach. Management would assess the situation and possibly 

collaborate with authorities to investigate such digital transgressions in a timely manner. 

During FY2021, we have not received any complaints, whether internally or externally (including regulatory 

bodies), regarding customer privacy breaches and had zero incidents of data breaches in terms of identified 

leakages, thefts or losses of customer data. Luxking is committed to maintain our clean record of zero data 

breaches







We classify data across our operations into three main categories in accordance to the 

nature of the data. The categories inform the requisite level of security and degree of 

access. 

All employees are required to protect company’s trade secrets and proprietary 

information, including customer data. Employees are required to read and understand 

related protection measures documented in the Employee Handbook.

We maintain a IT system to register and store confidential customer information 

at a restricted-access location. Approval is needed for copying such confidential 

information

TALENTS

Employee Training and Career Development

We believe that equipping our employees with the latest knowledge and skills related to their careers is 

essential in building a capable and passionate workforce in the long run. 

In FY2021, the Group has provided these training, educational or sharing sessions to our three employee 

groups. These are some of the highlighted topics

 



EMPLOYEE GROUP

TRAINING AND EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES

General Staff

• Emergency response protocol training

• Production safety training for new employees

• Operational safety procedures for high-risk positions

• Training on the use of firefighting equipment &amp; emergency escape 

routes

• Topical training such as the raw materials inspection, infrared 

spectroscopy 

• COVID-19 Pandemic Prevention Measures

Middle Management

• Product Safety

• Product Quality Enhancement and Techniques

• COVID-19 Pandemic Prevention Measures

• Lean Production Management

• Occupational Health &amp; Safety Workshops and Fire Drills

• Emergency Disaster Response Training

Senior Management

The myriad of training and educational topics is designed to suit every employee group respective to their job 

responsibilities and work coverage. Senior and middle management are focused on improving product quality 

and production management with higher efficiency as well as exchanging ideas with business partners. On 

the other hand, training for general staff is mostly dedicated to enhancing operational efficiency and uplifting 

skills on using specific equipment and tools in the frontline.

During the reporting year, the Group also organised regular training for all employees during the reporting

year. Before the introduction of any new equipment, employees are required to familiarise themselves with

new safety protocols in order to operate the equipment without close supervision.

PROTECTING 

OUR PEOPLE

Occupational Health &amp; Safety

The Group has been cultivating a strong culture of safety among our employees, especially for our factory 

staff and special equipment operators. We believe that it is our company’s moral responsibility to properly 

and adequately train our employees in prioritizing occupational health and safety (“OHS”) during their daily 

routines.

All of our employees are covered by our OHS management system, as mandated by the Production Safety 

Law of the PRC:

















The Entire Zhongshan Facility 

(within reporting scope)

Number of employees covered by the Group’s health and safety 

management system (internally audited)

5526

Percentage of employees covered by the Group’s occupational 

health and safety management system (internally audited)

100%

Luxking’s OHS management system has been working effectively since it has been established. There are 

clear OHS rules and procedures in which all employees must understand and adhere to. Our OHS handbook 

and various training protocols clearly defines the roles and responsibilities at each staff level and job type at 

Luxking. The OHS handbook also trains staff on how to document their specialized work routines in regards 

to following safety procedures. The Group’s OHS team assess on-site hazards and safety risks when they 

conduct surprise or regular inspections. Our frontline employees are encouraged to anonymously raise 

their concerns and safety recommendations through feedback boxes managed by our human resources 

department. We take employees’ suggestions seriously as they have the first-hand and onsite experience to 

spot not only potential safety risks, but also opportunities to enhance OHS for everyone’s wellbeing.

On the other hand, our robust Safety Production Training System is implemented in accordance with the 

Production Safety Law of the PRC, which requires all new hires to undergo at least 48 hours of safety training 

and pass a safety exam. The PRC legislation stipulates that all special equipment operators need to undertake 

professional training and be certified by the relevant authorities before they can commence any related work. 

At the Group level, we have produced two annual reports about production safety and OHS for employees 

working on either the BOPP films or tapes segments. The production teams of the two segments reviewed 

incidents and recommended areas of improvement to superiors so that safety loopholes could be sealed as 

quickly as possible. In the year, the Group has conducted medical inspections for employees to ensure that 

they are of fit and healthy status to work. For example, when several employees had medical issues after 

exposure to loud machinery noises at their posts, they were treated accordingly and relocated to suitable 

job posts with extremely low noise pollution. Preserving a healthy workforce remains our perceptual priority.

Special Measures on Tackling the Pandemic

In the sustained COVID-19 pandemic situation, the Group remained steadfast in our preventive and responsive 

measures. Abiding by the Law on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Disease (中华人民共和国传染病防

治法) and the Emergency Plan for Public Health Emergencies (突发公共卫生事件应急预案) of the PRC, these 

are the highlights of our measures:

















COVID-19 Pandemic Measures

Strict hygienic protocols on sanitation, personal hygiene and hand-washing

Wearing protective masks at all times 

Regularly disinfecting equipment and common areas such as canteens, meeting rooms and 

corridors

Emergency plans to report, isolate and treat suspected or actual cases of the virus to prevent 

pandemic spreading

A COVID-19 pandemic response committee, led by our Executive Chairman Mr. Leung Chee Kwong personally, 

is dedicated to draw up a pandemic response strategy with implementation plans (e.g inspection of personnel 

and vehicles in and out of premises, disinfection stations and emergency isolation wards) for departmental 

managers to promptly execute.

ENVIRONMENTAL

STEWARDSHIP

Luxking is committed to reduce our environmental impacts and search for more environmental-friendly 

solutions to be adopted. Specifically, we have set up The Environmental and Chemical Substance 

Management Committee (环境关联化学物质管理委员会), which is led by our general manager, that consists of 

representatives from a variety of departments like quality control, production, and sales. The Committee has 

the duty to monitor chemical hazards and assess environmental risks and set up environmental improvement 

targets to achieve. Our Environmental Management and Chemical Substance Guidance (环境关联化学物质管

理规定) is an essential yet comprehensive guidebook to govern tasks related to chemicals handling and supply 

chain documentation protocols. In this Guidance, we have outlined a detailed list and criteria of prohibited 

hazardous chemicals to not be used in our products8. In FY2021, we have compiled a List of Environmental 

Issues9 (环境因素清单) that our managers and frontline workers should consider when conducting production 

activities.

FSC-Certified Paper Pulp Supply

In our FY2020 report, the Group also determined that the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification will 

be one criterion when procuring paper supplies. This year we took action and evaluated that over 48% of our 

paper supplied came from paper pulps10 that are either FSC certified or with other certifications. The result is 

encouraging and we would continue to push more of our paper suppliers to adopt FSC-level certifications.

Water and Effluents

Luxking acknowledges the significance of water conservation and wastewater treatment. Our operations 

team track, analyze and review our factory’s monthly water usage before setting commensurate reduction 

targets on water use. As with previous reporting years, the Group did not withdraw municipal water supply 

from water-stressed areas. Water is used for these main purposes: production of BOPP films and Tapes, 

portable water use by staff, general cleaning and evaporative cooling. The water usage for FY2021 and 

FY2020 by the whole Zhongshan factory is shown here:

ENVIRONMENTAL

STEWARDSHIP

As depicted by the figures, we have experienced a higher amount of water usage than the previous year 

although our water intensity stays within acceptable range due to our increased revenue. The reasons for the 

water usage increase are due to the following:

• 

Higher water withdrawn due to measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including increased 

frequency of cleaning and sanitizing, heightened hygienic standard in premises.

• 

Water usage in our factory cooling system amplified due to higher average temperatures over the year. 

Water was irrigated on rooftops of production units hence cooling could be achieved through water 

evaporation.

• 

We carried out a major maintenance of machinery utilizing water for cleaning, where inspections are 

carried out every 3-5 years depending on machine conditions. 

• 

We discovered a leakage in the underground water supply system and tubes. The leakage was 

successfully fixed and experts were hired to examine the whole underground water network in our 

factory’s vicinity. No further anomalies were found.

For FY2022, we have revised our water intensity target to be 0.400ML/mil RMB.

Our on-site tertiary wastewater treatment plant11 continues to be a critical element in our environmental 

measures. The plant operates according to the international ISO14001:2015 standard, where our environmental 

safety department oversees the quality of treated effluent to ensure compliance with the discharge limits of 

water pollutants. On a daily basis, used portable water by our cleaning staff is discharged into the municipal 

sewage system. The Group continues to evaluate suitable solutions for better and more efficient water 

treatment.

11 

During the treatment process, wastewater passes through four treatment tanks: the treatment tank, anaerobic tank, storage tank and 

aerobic tank.
