MESSAGE FROM BOARD 

BOARD STATEMENT 

 

Dear Stakeholders, 

Huan Hsin Holdings Limited has progressed into the second year of sustainability reporting 

and we believe that integrating sustainability in our business strategies will influence our 

business success.  

This year, we have made good progress in managing the Environmental, Social and 

Governance (“ESG”) issues in our long-term sustainable business strategies. We 

strengthened our commitment to build a sustainable business with the direction to 

improving the economic, environmental and social well-being of the communities.  

At Huan Hsin, we are committed to provide equal opportunities and fair employment 

practices. Furthermore, we also recognise the importance of employees’ welfare and strive 

to ensure that it is always taken care of. In FY2018, we have made good progress in 

managing the turnover rate within the organisation. The employee turnover rate has 

decreased to 12% as compared to 32.3% in FY2017.   

We recognise the importance of maintaining a balance between economic, environmental, 

social and governance obligations. In this regard, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of 

the Company takes into consideration sustainability issues as part of the strategic 

formulation even as they pursue business growth. 

Looking ahead, we will continually improve our performance and proactively integrate 

sustainable practices into our business strategy.

PEOPLE 

OUR APPROACH 

Our people are important to us. We are committed to maximising their employment 

capabilities. We achieve this by organising comprehensive training programmes, not only 

when they first join the company, but throughout their career here. This training is also 

necessary to ensure the highest standards of workplace safety and product quality. 

Furthermore, we believe in establishing a strong team culture at work, where all our 

employees respect and look out for one another. [103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

increase to 1.0% as compared to 0.4% in FY2017. Recruitment of new employees is

Singapore’s fair employment guidelines laid out by the Ministry of Manpower.

EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT 

We believe that training and education play an important role in cultivating, developing and 

enhancing employees’ skill and career development to enable them to be efficient and 

effective in their respective roles at work. We endeavor to provide training programmes to 

ensure that employees understand the importance of workplace safety and responsible 

usage of energy, which are key priorities in our organisation.  

We also encourage teambuilding activities or workshops to foster greater workplace 

cohesion and trust. These activities help managers to better understand the employees 

working under them and tailor their leadership style to match their needs.  

We are currently in the process of implementing a management training programme to 

prepare high-performing individuals with great leadership potential for the next step in their 

careers. We advocate ongoing skills improvement and attending development programmes 

to enable the high-performing individuals to achieve and perform to their highest 

capabilities. [102-8] 

ENVIRONMENT 

OUR APPROACH 

Huan Hsin is fully aware of the increased environmental consciousness within the 

manufacturing industry and has identified the ESG aspect as one of our top priorities. We 

are ISO 14001 certified and have company policies on environmental issues documented in 

our Environmental Health and Safety Manual. All members of the company – from 

employees to Board members – are expected to read and understand the guidelines stated 

in the manual. We encourage our employees to become strong advocates for the 

environment, and ensure they adhere to our policies.  

Our Environmental Health and Safety Manual is also applicable to all potential suppliers. 

Suppliers have to meet a strict set of environmental criteria in order to be a part of our 

supply chain. We believe that it is our responsibility to not only ensure that we conduct our 

business responsibly, but also encourage businesses who work alongside us to adopt safe 

environmental practices. [103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE 

We analyse and follow the environmental laws and regulations in the countries we operate 

in closely. We have formulated and established various environmental management 

systems, emergency plans and environmental safety work procedures. 

 

We aim to maintain this level of performance through continual adherence and enhancement 

of our policies and practices.  [307-1] 

ENERGY 

Energy consumption is a key issues of concern, we have established energy management 

guidelines to effectively manage energy usage within our organisation. The Environmental 

Health and Safety Manual guidelines has outlined clearly the various roles and responsibilities 

among the employees, which to ensure that employees are mindful of their actions and collect 

relevant energy data. For example our employees are encouraged to minimise energy usage 

by reminding one another to switch off their equipment when not in use or leaving their 

workstations for long period of time. Managerial staff also conduct regular inspections and 

keep track of weekly energy consumption levels. 

With the monitoring initiative in place, it aligns with the company’s goal by reducing the 

energy consumption and achieve greater efficiency in the use of energy to lower the operating 

costs. 

The below charts show the detailed breakdown of Huan Hsin’s energy consumption statistics.

Figure 5: Energy Consumption (kWh) 

Our total energy consumption for 2018 was recorded at 1,954,680 kWh. 

In the future, we are looking to implement additional initiatives to minimise our energy 

consumption. We are in the process to establishing an Energy Management Policy to 

regulate energy usage per employee based on their duties. At the same time, we have 

conducted training to our employees about energy consumption, such as through poster 

campaign at workstations. These posters will contain bite-sized information on the benefits 

of saving energy, as well as reminders about responsible day-to-day energy usage. With 

these measures in place, we aim to achieve greater efficiency in the use of energy to lower 

our operating costs. [103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 302-1] 

SUPPLIER ASSESSMENT 

At Huan Hsin, we evaluate our potential suppliers. It is our practice to include applicable 

environmental standards in our supplier contracts. Some of these standards include 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations, the impact of the supplier’s products 

and services and impact of the supplier’s transport operations on the environment. 

Employees have detailed roles and responsibilities that are detailed in the Environmental 

Health and Safety Manual – from creating a new case file for each supplier, evaluating the 

materials they use in manufacturing, to ensuring safety and environmental compliance. 

In FY2018, we have onboarded 2 new suppliers, drawing our total number of suppliers to 

179 and all of our new suppliers were assessed based on our company’s environmental 

standards. We have established standard procedure to ensure all new and potential 

suppliers are assessed. 

 [103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 308-1]
