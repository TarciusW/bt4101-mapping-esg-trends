SinoCloud Group Limited  

Sustainability Report 2019 

 

 

SinoCloud Group Limited (the “Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) started as 

an information technology and professional services provider in 2003, serving the banking and 

financial services industry in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”).   

 

The Group recognises the importance of business expansion and diversification to meet ever-

evolving information technology (“IT”) demands. Since 2013, aside from maintaining IT services as a 

core business, the Group began to identify other IT-related business initiatives and diversified its 

business in mobile satellite services in the PRC. In October 2015, the Group expanded its business to 

include  the provision of IDC services with its acquisition of 63% effective equity interests in Guiyang 

Zhongdian Gaoxin Digital Technologies Limited (“Guiyang Zhongdian”), an IDC asset in the city of 

Guiyang, Guizhou province, the PRC. Guiyang Zhongdian is principally engaged in the business of 

operating IDC services, cloud computing and big data services, with a hosting capacity of 5,000 racks. 

Currently, the Group has an effective equity interest of 60% in the Guiyang Zhongdian, where the 

remaining 40% is owned by Guiyang Gaoxin Big Data Fund Company. Guiyang Zhongdian is currently 

in its phase II development, with a hosting capacity of 1,500 racks. The Group has focused its efforts 

and resources in growing and developing its business in the IDC industry.  

 

The management of the Company recognizes that sustainability is a key component of the Group‘s 

long term business strategy. This Sustainability Report (“Report”) focuses on the sustainability 

practices and strategies of the Group. We seek to meet the interests of our stakeholders by 

providing non-financial information of the Group and demonstrate our efforts to report to 

shareholders of the Company (“Shareholders”) and other stakeholders on the steps that we are 

taking to achieve a sustainable business model and our achievements and action plans to contribute 

to the society and a more sustainable environment.  

 

In today’s investment climate, non-tangible financial factors are becoming increasingly important to 

our stakeholders. Stakeholders are beginning to look beyond economic and operational factors in 

evaluating management and corporate accountability. This Report is based on economic, social and 

environmental issues that are material to our Group and serve as a platform for us to communicate 

our achievements and plans to our Stakeholders.

Board Statement 

 

This is the Group’s second sustainability report. We believe that sustainability is an integral part of 

the Group’s philosophy. We will continue our efforts in creating meaningful and sustainable impacts 

for our stakeholders and will look to the next phase of our sustainability journey by reviewing our 

strategies and initiatives. The board of directors of the Company oversees the management to 

monitor and promote accountability, integrity and transparency for the continued sustainability of 

its businesses and value creation for its stakeholders in the long run, in order to enable the Group to 

manage and address the Economic, Environmental, Social, and Governance (“EESG”) factors, which 

are important to our businesses. 

 

 

Report Scope and Sustainability Reporting Framework 

 

All data and statistics provided in this Report are in relation to the Group’s operations. On 1 March 

2019, the Company announced that it had changed its financial year end from 31 March to 30 June. 

Accordingly, this Report addresses the activities and data that fall within the Group for the 15 

months financial year from 1 April 2018 to 30 June 2019 (“FY2019”), and the figures are represented 

in Hong Kong dollars.  

 

This Report focuses on addressing our Group’s EESG issues in line with Rules 711A and 711B of the 

Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited 

(“SGX-ST”). With this information, we aspire to provide stakeholders with an accurate, complete and 

meaningful overview on how we manage these sustainability issues across our business sectors.  

 

This Report adopts the reporting framework set out under the Global Reporting Initiatives (GRI) G4 

Guidelines. We have prepared the Report in accordance with the GRI G4 – core level standards, and 

based on a Group-wide materiality assessment in consultation with our Board, as we believes it is 

internationally recognised and is widely adopted. The GRI content index and relevant references are 

disclosed in pages 8 to 9 of this Report. 

 

This Report, together with the Corporate Governance Report on pages 9 to 36 of our Annual Report 

2019, illustrates the Group’s EESG factors and the policies, practices and performance of the 

business operations.   

 

We welcome all feedback on this Report to enable us to consistently improve our policies and 

systems. Please send your feedback and comments to enquiry@sinocloudgroup.com. 

 

 

Materiality Assessment 

 

Based on our Group-wide materiality assessment, we have outlined our strategic sustainability 

priorities through these steps: 

 

1. 

Defining key issues which impact the execution of our business strategy; 

2. 

Identifying critical areas that affect our businesses and stakeholders; 

3. 

Prioritising these critical factors and validate internally as pressing issues to address; and  

4. 

Embedding best practices within our business operation processes where applicable. 

 

The Group identified the specific EESG factors which are material to the Group based on our 

knowledge of our respective business areas, the challenges faced by the industry and the 

corresponding implications for the Group’s businesses and operations. We also considered the 


 

Page 3 of 9 

insights that we gained from our day-to-day engagements and consultations with various 

stakeholders to establish the direction for our sustainability reporting. 

 

The materiality assessment is endorsed by the Board, and these priorities are reviewed on a yearly 

basis. We have since reviewed our material issues compared to what we have early identified during 

the commencement of the preparation of this report and have updated these issues in view of 

today’s operational context.  

 

 

 

 

 

Material EESG Factors 

 

The Group has identified the following material EESG factors that are important to the sustainability 

of our organisation and business, rank according to risk and prioritisation : 

a) Economic Performance 

b) Corporate Governance 

c) Employees 

d) Environment 

e) Community 

f) Corporate Communication 

 

 

Our Focus, Commitments &amp; Targets 

 

With our material EESG factors identified and key stakeholders in mind, we have also mapped our 

sustainability priorities, impact to stakeholders and boundaries under the key focus areas set out 

below. We believe this approach will cover critical areas of our businesses, is sustainable, and can 

align the Group with its profitability.  

 

We envision that these initiatives will lead to increased value creation, along with positive impact to 

our operating natural environment and societies. We are committed to ensure measurable targets 

and goals towards our journey to create sustainable value for all our stakeholders in the Group’s 

long-term business strategy.

the financial period from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018 (“FY2018”), due to the decrease in sales of 

projects and sales of equipment. Please refer to the “Message from Chairman and CEO” section 

(page 4 to 5) and the audited financial statements section (page 47 to 140) of our Annual Report 

2019 for more information on our economic performance. The Group has positioned itself to further

Corporate Governance 

 

Our scope of corporate governance activities are set out in pages 9 to 36 of our Annual Report 2019. 

Our Group’s operating policies and procedures are designed to ensure that appropriate segregation 

of duties and controls are in place to minimise risk and potential threat. 

 

The Group advocates ethical business practices and adopts zero tolerance for bribery and corruption 

in its dealings and operations.  All employees shall abide by and comply with the rules and guidelines 

set out in the employee handbook.   

 

Our internal audit function for FY2019 has been outsourced to Corporate Governance Professionals 

Limited (formerly known as Baker Tilly Hong Kong Risk Assurance Limited) (“CGPL”) which reports to 

the Chairman of the Audit Committee on internal control matters and seek clarification from the 

Chief Executive Officer and/or Chief Financial Officer of the Company on administrative matters.

basis.  

 

The Group promotes transparency and have a whistleblowing policy in place, in which any employee 

of the Group may, in confidence, raise concerns and report any suspicions of non-compliance on

Page 6 of 9 

prejudicial implications to these employees. For FY2019, the Group did not receive any 

whistleblowing reports. 

 

The Group has to comply with the rules and regulations in all places we do business.  Our employees 

understand that they are responsible for understanding and complying with all rules and regulations 

that are required in the business and operations of the Group. In this way, we proactively avoid both 

the monetary and reputational risks associated with sanctions and fines for non-compliance. For

For more information on our Board’s involvement, please refer to the “Corporate Governance 

Report” section on pages 9 to 36 of our Annual Report 2019. 

 

 

Employees 

 

Our staffs are our key assets. Our Group’s framework for managing employees emphasizes 

performance, achievements, and activities irrespective of employment status. We expect our 

employees to put the Group’s interests into practice and raise their level of professionalism. Our 

employees’ concept of work focuses on performance and achievement through this approach. This 

approach has firmly taken root across the Group. 

 

Our personnel development is anchored in each employee’s aspiration to learn and grow by setting 

goals on his or her own initiative. Our basic policy for personnel development is to offer on-the-job 

training complemented and enhanced by off-the-job group training. At each workplace, we clearly 

define the roles of staff responsible for different aspects of training under a system in which each 

employee sets his or her own annual education plan as a means for raising motivation to learn by 

systematically addressing both the workplace and employee needs and interests. Moreover, to meet 

the needs of the ever-changing business environment, we are focused on nurturing human 

resources with advanced expertise and responsiveness to change, as well as systematic identification 

of those who can demonstrate their talents in the marketplace. 

 

The Group acknowledges the importance of social equity and the provision of equal opportunities in 

an environment that is safe and healthy for its employees; this includes hiring without prejudice, 

regardless of age, gender and ethnicity. Please refer to the “Corporate Governance” section of the 

Company’s 2019 Annual Report for information on the composition of the Board. The Group has 

zero tolerance on hiring of child labour and requires its service providers and sub-contractors to be 

in-sync on this before engaging their services. 

 

To achieve this:- 

 

(a) We will conduct regular reviews to ensure that our remuneration package is in line with industry 

standard and commensurate with the job. 

(b) We will offer a sustainable performance bonus based on the Group’s and the employee’s 

performance. 

(c) We will identify and promote deserving staff with potential to develop their career in the 

organisation. 

(d) We will align our human resource policies to comply with labour laws and regulations in respect 

of minimum wage requirements, social security contribution requirements and work hours etc.  

 

Guiyang Zhongdian, the Company’s principal subsidiary, conducts annual review of the 

remuneration package of its staff. The management of Guiyang Zhongdian will ensure that the 

human resource policies are in line with the relevant labour laws and regulations of the PRC. In 


 

Page 7 of 9 

addition, the Company has a performance share plan in place to reward all management and staff in 

accordance with their performance and Group’s performance objective. For FY2019, the Company 

did not issue any performance shares. 

 

 

Environment 

 

Preserving the environment is necessary for the long-term sustainability of our business, and they 

are mutually dependent. While creating value in our business, we aim to minimise the impact that 

our activities have on the environment and proactively seek alternative means for more effective 

and sustainable use of resources. Our Group’s mission is to adopt and implement environmentally 

green solutions in our business and we expect our business partners and service providers to commit 

and adhere to the same standards. 

 

Our Group has the following policy in place to address the following issues:-   

 

(a) 

Implement systematic cuts to paper usage and waste volumes; 

(b) 

Engage each employee in thinking about the environment and making his or her own 

contribution actively via recycling of used paper; and 

(c) 

Promote proactive environmental communication, within and outside the Group. 

 

We obtained our shareholders’ approval to issue electronic copies of our annual report starting from 

FY2019. As a result, we managed to reduce printed copies of our annual report for FY2019 by 95% 

when compared to FY2018. Hardcopy of our annual report will only be provided upon request by 

shareholders. 

 

 

Corporate Communication 

 

The Group is committed to creating long-term value for all its stakeholders and will continue to 

maintain ongoing communication and engagement with its stakeholders. Details of the 

communication and engagement with our shareholders are set out in the section on “Shareholders 

Rights and Responsibilities” of the Corporate Governance Report on pages 25 to 26 of our Annual 

Report 2019. 

 

The Group will conduct general meeting annually to provide Shareholders an opportunity to voice 

their views. Board of directors and external auditors are present in the Group’s FY2019 general 

meeting to address Shareholders’ queries. 

 

Other than our Shareholders, we will try to engage with both internal and external stakeholders such 

as our customers, supplier and regulators in setting up our future goals. We believe that through 

collaboration and partnerships that we can accelerate sustainability in our Company and in the 

world.
