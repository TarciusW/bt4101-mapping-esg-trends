BOARD STATEMENT  102-14 

Dear stakeholders,  

 

I would like to thank everyone for the support 

provided to MYP Ltd. (“MYP”) together with its 

subsidiaries (the “Group”) during the year. 

While we are facing an ever-changing 

environment, MYP will continue to monitor 

closely the local and various markets in the 

Southeast Asia region, and exercise financial 

prudence with strong business acumen to 

ensure our investment decisions always 

further our aim of a sustainable growth and 

optimal returns for the Group and our 

shareholders.  

We apply this strategy through: 

- Acquiring iconic buildings and enhancing 

their desirability and value; and 

- Maximising 

the 

potential 

in 

existing 

buildings 

and 

transforming 

them 

to 

enhance their facilities, functions and value. 

In addition to optimising returns, we also 

recognise the importance of ensuring the 

sustainability of the Group. We are pleased to 

present our Sustainability Report 2020 (the 

“Report”). 

This Report aims to inform our stakeholders 

about our sustainability performance in a 

transparent and accountable manner. It covers 

the Group’s strategies, policies, practices and 

performance 

in 

relation 

to 

economic, 

environmental, social and governance issues 

(“ESG”). 

Our report draws on the internationally 

recognised framework, the Global Reporting  

 

 

Initiative’s (“GRI”) Sustainability 

Reporting 

Standards.  

At MYP, we recognise that sustainability forms 

an integral part of our operations and strategies, 

and we strive to drive our operations in the 

direction in which we can contribute positively 

to all our stakeholders.  

After conducting a materiality review and 

assessment with our external consultants, we 

have identified 14 indicators that matter the 

most to our business and stakeholders.       

These material issues are taken into account 

through our four sustainability strategies – 

Business Integrity, Environmental Sustainability, 

Health &amp; Safety and Human Capital.

BOARD STATEMENT  102-14 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Business Integrity 

Business integrity and corporate governance 

are important core values to MYP. We do not 

tolerate any form of corruption or fraud within 

the organisation.  

Policies have been established to address 

business 

conducts 

expected 

from 

all 

employees. 

Our 

whistleblowing 

policy 

provides avenues for staff to raise concerns 

about possible improprieties in matters which 

may adversely affect the Group. In addition, 

we enforce a Code of Conduct and Ethics. It 

sets out guidelines for our employees to 

practise appropriate workplace behaviours 

and how to partner with our stakeholders in an 

ethical and responsible manner. 

 

 

 

Environmental Sustainability 

With growing importance of sustainability, we 

recognise that there is a need to contribute 

towards combatting climate change. MYP is 

committed to minimising our environmental 

impact by focusing on reducing our energy 

footprint while concurrently balancing our 

commercial needs. 

 

Health &amp; Safety and Human Capital 

Our employees and tenants are highly valued 

as they are the key contributors to MYP’s 

growth and success.  

We focus on the health and safety of our 

employees and tenants by ensuring that their 

working environment is safe. Hence, we 

emphasise on maintaining the structural 

integrity of our buildings and putting 

adequate safety measures in place. 

These are achieved through various initiatives 

such as conducting annual table-top briefings 

to tenants, forming certified first aid teams for 

each building and implementing emergency 

response plans at each site.

Looking Ahead 

The dynamic and fast paced environment 

today

We recognise the need to adapt our 

operations and sustainability strategies to

sustainability into our daily operations across 

the Group. We appreciate and are thankful to 

all our stakeholders who are embarking this 

journey with us to build a more sustainable

OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY 

Materiality Review Process 102-44 102-46 102-47 

The Materiality Principle is applied to define the 

content of the Sustainability Report.  

As part of MYP’s processes to determine 

materiality, an internal strategy review and 

sustainability workshop moderated by an 

external consultant was organised. During 

these sessions, the Group reviewed its vision, 

mission, core values, strategic directions, 

sustainability impacts and material topics.  

 

We 

reflected 

on 

significant 

economic, 

environmental and social impacts to determine 

topics that are material to the organisation. 14 

indicators, which are grouped into three main 

categories, 

were 

identified 

during 

the 

assessment conducted in accordance with GRI’s 

Sustainability Reporting Standards 2016.  

The materiality assessment was subsequently 

endorsed by MYP’s Sustainability Reporting 

Committee.

ENVIRONMENT 

Energy Consumption 302-1 

Electricity forms a bulk of the overall energy 

consumption in running a commercial building. 

Therefore, it is essential to closely monitor the 

trend and focus on electricity reduction 

initiatives that can significantly improve the 

energy efficiency of the buildings, while 

ensuring liveability and long-term sustainability. 

Tracking 

and 

monitoring 

electricity 

consumption is performed monthly. 

For FYE 2020, the Group consumed a total of 

3,117,237 kilowatts of electricity across the 

common areas of two commercial properties.  

 

Reduction of Energy Consumption 302-4 

MYP is committed to ensuring energy efficiency 

as part of our sustainability strategies. We 

recognise the importance of energy reduction. 

Installation of lighting motion sensors in 

common areas for MYP Centre is just one 

example of our energy-saving initiatives. 

We are pleased to announce that MYP Centre 

has been awarded Gold for the BCA Green Mark 

(Gold) since August 2016. The BCA Green Mark 

is a benchmarking scheme that aims to 

recognise the best practices in environmental 

design and performance. 

 

 

 

 

 

Water 303-1 

MYP strives to achieve a balance in water 

conservation and providing a reliable supply of 

water to its tenants. Water consumption of all 

commercial 

properties 

is 

tracked 

and 

monitored monthly.  

For FYE 2020, the Group’s water consumption 

totalled to 25,309 cubic metres.
