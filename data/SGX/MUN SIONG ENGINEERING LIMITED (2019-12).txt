Materiality

To identify the materiality aspects that 

are of essential importance to our Group, 

the Sustainability Steering Committee 

together with respective stakeholders 

assessed our work activities and 

identified potential areas of concerns.

Following the materiality assessment, 

we compiled the sustainability aspects 

that are of relevance to us based on 

the guidelines of the Global Reporting 

Initiative (GRI 2016). 

We gathered the feedback from various 

internal stakeholders and discussed 

them in our Sustainability Steering 

Committee to assess their significance 

to our Group. The results were then 

transferred to a matrix sorted in order 

of relevance. Those aspects that had 

been identified as being material were 

validated and prioritised.

Human Capital

We are fully committed to the professional 

development of our workforce to ensure 

high quality performance that benefits 

both the company and our employees. 

Upon joining the company, all new 

employees are required to complete a 1 

week on-boarding program to familiarise 

themselves with the company culture and 

industry practices.

In support of our business expansion 

plans in 2019, several new HR programs 

were introduced in Singapore as well as 

our overseas subsidiaries. Over 20% of 

our employees were assigned to overseas 

projects in Taiwan, India, Indonesia and 

US enabling them to gain exposure and 

share their expertise with our teams 

globally. 

New Hires

Being in the process industry where 

skills are of top priority, we recognise 

different talents a fair chance of being 

employed regardless of their nationality. 

In 2019, we have employed more than 

180 employees across the Group. More 

than 25% percent of our new hires 

graduated with a Masters or a Degree, 

15% graduated with a Diploma and 45% 

are professionally certified. 

Talent Management

In a bid to improve the quality of work and 

performance, we have introduced a Key 

Performance Indicators (KPI) program 

for all employees. These indicators will be 

used as a factor for our reward system. 

At the same time, a systematic employee 

career plan is developed for all our staff. 

Data collected from our Employee 

Engagement Survey helps our leaders 

to take specific steps to improve 

engagement as well as retain key 

talents. Our results have improved over 

time, and have indicated a higher level of 

effectiveness and team performance.

take on shared parental responsibilities

who are entitled, have fully claimed their 

parental and childcare leave benefits. We

started a family and encourage them to 

strike a healthy balance between work 

and family.

Women in Our Workforce

Despite operating in a traditionally male 

dominated industry, we offer equal rights 

and equal job opportunities for all female 

candidates who are eager to grow their

Mun Siong Engineering Limited

Environment

This report is limited to data collected 

from our Head Quarters. Data from our 

site offices are not collected as they 

are situated within our customers’ 

premises. 

We have planned and executed 

campaigns to educate and encourage our 

employees to practice water, electricity 

and diesel conservation habits. We aim 

to continue to raise awareness and build 

on such conservation habits among our 

employees.

We track and monitor our water and 

electricity consumption on a daily basis 

and conduct immediate investigations 

if the readings portray an unusual hike, 

We also conduct monthly inspections 

on all water points in our building to 

ensure that there are no leaks.

Water

This year, we noticed an increase in our 

water consumption because we have 

experienced an increase in manpower 

at our headquarters and longer yard 

working hours. Hydro jetting - one of 

our main business activities, requires 

the use of high pressured water to clean 

heat exchangers, tube bundles and air 

fin coolers. In a bid to make our hydro 

jetting operations more sustainable, 

we have implemented an initiative 

to recycle water  from hyrdo jetting. 

This is done through a mechanism to 

separate the oil, water and particles 

from the pit which will then be pumped 

into a tank to be reused for the next 

hydro jetting job.

Electricity

As of December 2019, we have 

successfully replaced approximately 

90% of our lights bulbs to LED. We 

have observed an increase in electricity 

usage in 2019 as compared to 2018. 

This is due to an increase in quantities 

of fabrication works conducted at our 

head quarter workshop to support 

site works. The frequency of late work 

activities in our yard has also increased. 

Diesel

Diesel powers our fleet of vehicles and 

operational equipment. In line with the 

increased fabrication works conducted 

at our Head Quarters, we have 

experienced a similar increase in our 

diesel consumption. Our drivers receive 

feedback from the tracking systems 

installed in their vehicles in 2017, and 

are reminded on ways in which they can 

change their driving habits and reduce 

diesel consumption in the long run. In 

the coming years, we are working on 

solutions to better manage our routes 

to help promote more efficient use of 

diesel in our operations.

Mun Siong Engineering Limited

Our safety core value is “To put the safety 

of everyone above all” - this remains our top 

priority. We have always been committed 

to providing a safe working environment 

to all our employees. Our Group of 

companies are OHSAS18001, ISO14001 

and BizSafe Star level certified. We have 

also received the WSH Performance Silver 

Award from the Workplace Safety and 

Health Council for 2 consecutive years.

Environmental Compliance

We have been successful in achieving 

zero non-compliances with environmental 

laws and regulations. We will continue to 

remain compliant by taking necessary 

precautions to ensure zero spillage from 

our diesel tanks and also ensure that we 

discharge contaminated industrial water 

through our sump pits which are regulated 

and in compliance with environmental 

regulations. There were no cases of 

occupational diseases as regular medical 

checks, provision of Personal Protective 

Equipment and trainings were conducted 

as and when deemed necessary by 

specific jobs or tasks.

Managing Risks

We manage risks through the development 

and implementation of new safe work 

procedures, risk assessments, regular 

safety trainings and campaigns. Regular 

safety meetings are conducted to raise 

and address key areas of concerns and 

are attended by employees of all levels 

within the organisation. Key performance 

indicators are consolidated while we 

observe leading and lagging indicators to 

determine the implementation of safety 

initiatives. We have also implemented 

a hand safety campaign named “Hi 5, 

Love your hands” as most of near misses 

and minor incidents over the years are 

hand related. This campaigns highlights 

hazards and risks which may cause hand 

injury to the workers, and through better 

understanding of the hazards and risks 

they are facing, it will allow us to reduce 

hand related near misses and minor 

incidents by 12%.

Building An Intervention Culture

Regardless of non-occurrences of major 

incidents, we have had several cases of 

near misses and minor incidents over the 

years. In most cases, we have observed 

that they could have been prevented if 

there were interventions by co-workers. 

Leading indicators led us to believe that 

as an organisation, we need to build an 

effective intervention culture.

To achieve this, we have established 

a Care, Intervene, and Thank (CIT) 

Program in 2018 that aims to provide us 

with a framework on how we must care 

and intervene in at risk situations with 

respect. The CIT Program is a “No Blame 

Culture” and a “Safe Zone” program. In 

2019, a series of activities were rolled 

out including skits, coaching sessions, 

practice sessions were introduced to 

guide and encourage our workforce to 

actively participate in this campaign. 

To encourage staff participation in the CIT 

program, all submissions of CIT sharing 

cards are collated and tabulated. 

Tabulated results will sort staff into 3 

reward categories, gold, silver and bronze. 

As of December 2019, 1 Silver and 8 

Bronze Badges have been awarded to 

employees who have actively participated 

in the CIT Program. Moving forward, we 

will continue to implement new safety 

campaigns and programs to ensure that 

every employee goes home safe each 

day.

WORKERS PARTICIPATION

Mun Siong believes that the person who 

understands their work and effectiveness 

of current control measures best are 

our workers. With that in mind, we 

launched a new program named Workers 

Representative Program. As the name 

suggests, workers with a good safety 

mindset is selected and asked to perform 

the role of a worker representative. The 

selected workers will then be trained to 

understand how to conduct their role. 

The worker representatives are involved 

in the formulation of risk assessments 

and are invited to site SHE committee 

meetings, where they can share with 

the management any safety issues or 

challenges they might be facing. They 

would also act as a bridge to bring any 

concerns of their peers who may not 

be confident enough to approach the 

management and/or safety personnel 

directly.

SAFETY OUT OF WORK

Other than maintaining a high safety 

standard in our workplace, Mun Siong 

believes that we can extend good safety 

practices into our employees’ lives. Thus 

Mun Siong conducted talks on dormitory 

safety as well as talks on home and 

personal safety, to ensure that our staff 

practices safety at home and at work.









Mun Siong Engineering’s Bukom team 

received two valuable awads from our client 

- Shell for the Best Blue Zone Qualification 

Award and 3.5 Million Man Hours Worked 

with Outstanding Safety Performance
