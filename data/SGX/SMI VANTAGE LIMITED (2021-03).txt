OUR BUSINESS AND STRATEGIES 

 

 



 

 

Dear Stakeholders,  

 

Sustainable growth is an important consideration for SMI’s business. The Board of Directors of SMI 

(the “Board”) has considered the sustainability topics as part of our business strategy. The Board 

oversees the monitoring and management of the material ESG aspects. 

 

Last year, we have established some sustainability targets in our inaugural sustainability report. This 

year, we need to advise that only limited progress could be made as most of the operations in 

Myanmar, particularly our largest operation Travel Retail, were closed throughout nearly all of the 

year.  

 

Measures have been taken to reduce plastic usage in our Food &amp; Beverage (F&amp;B) and Travel &amp; 

Fashion Retail operations, reducing plastic bag usage as well as the usage of plastic cups in our 

restaurants. In the upcoming years, we will look into implementing more initiatives to further reduce 

plastic waste in our operations.  

 

We have focused this year on providing opportunities and funding for the people working on our 

business in Myanmar to be vaccinated for COVID-19, and more than 100 people have benefited so 

far. In addition, we have acquired oxygen supply equipment for emergency treatment. We have also 

supplied dedicated transport so that those working in the domestic market can move safely and 

securely between their homes and places of work. In Singapore, we have implemented work from 

home in accordance with government regulations.  

 

We greatly value our people and seek to continue to grow our talent pool through our investments in 

training and development of our employees which we plan to renew after recovery of the local 

economy and opening up to international travel.  

 

We have contributed to the development of local communities by creating jobs, paying taxes and 

doing business with local enterprises. And we have been a major sponsorship of Room to Read the 

educational charity and have also sponsored performance by young Myanmar nationals who are 

developing an interest in classical music.

On top of our risk management approach, policies and procedures including the Employees’ Code of 

Conduct, anti-corruption and whistle blowing are also in place to instill the value of integrity and 

transparency within the Group. 

Employees’ Code of Conduct 

The behavior expected from our employees is codified in our employees’ Code of Conduct. The 

underlying principle for our Code of Conduct is that we expect our employees to act with integrity 

towards those with whom we have business dealings, to the larger society with whom we conduct our 

business, and towards each other. 

 

An employee handbook that covers penalties for misconduct and fraud and guides all employees in 

their everyday conduct is made available to all employees. For new hires, they are made aware of our 

stance against corruption and fraudulent activities during the orientation programme. 

 

The Employees’ Code of Conduct provides the following examples of misconduct that shall lead to 

disciplinary actions: 

 

•    Dishonest actions or unethical conduct;

areas: 

 

•    Reporting on actual or suspected corruption and bribery 

•    Guidance on gift giving and acceptance 

•    Training and awareness

process.

conduct, financial malpractice or other wrong doings that poses risks to the Group, the public or the 

environment. Under this policy, employees may report suspected matters of wrongdoing affecting the 

Group to the Whistle Blowing   Officer   via   the   following   email: whistleblowing@sin-mi.com.   

Through   our   independent whistleblowing channel, employees are able to report any suspected 

misconducts without reprisal.

Owing to the major disruption to the business caused by COVID-19 and 

other developments in Myanmar, it was not possible to carry out 

organized training in FY2021.  

 

 

In previous years, we have provided training opportunities to our employees to develop their skills. 

This has included language trainings for employees working at the airport to enhance their ability to 

communicate effectively with tourists and business travelers from different nationalities. 

 

In addition, we have provided product orientation training programs for employees working as brand 

representatives for our business partners to ensure they are adequately equipped with product 

knowledge and information for their customers. 

 

In the F&amp;B franchised outlets, we provide training on food handling, hygiene and safety.

Community Involvement 

 

At SMI, we aim to deliver positive impact to the local communities we operate in. Therefore, over the 

past few years, the Group has actively engaged with the local community and partake in various social 

initiatives to improve the living standards and conditions of the locals.  

Room to Read 

Room to Read was founded in 2000 with the vision of a world in which 

all children can pursue a quality education that enables them to reach 

their full potential and contribute to their communities and the world. SMI 

is proud to be supporting Room to Read’s two-year literacy project in 

Myanmar. Our President &amp; CEO, Mark Bedingham, is also a committee 

member of the ASEAN Regional Board for Room to Read 

 

 

Under the Room to Read program, SMI works with the local business partner, Myanmar Book Aid and 

Preservation Foundation to establish and support 20 libraries in three regions in schools as well as 

give educators in the schools the skills and tools to sustain the libraries so that students have the 

opportunity to foster a habit of reading.   

 

Community Involvement Programs 

 

At SMI, we encourage our employees to initiate and propose community involvement programs to 

engage the local communities.

ENVIRONMENTAL 

 

 

 

Plastic and other non-biodegradable waste have a 

harmful effect on our environment and. Hence, 

reducing plastic waste is one of our key areas of 

sustainability focus.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

At our Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf outlets, we have also replaced plastic cups that were used to contain 

milk with porcelain jugs. Moving forward, we continue to look to implement more initiatives, such as 

reducing the use of straws at our outlets to reduce plastic waste. 

 

 

 

 

Through these initiatives, we hope to not only reduce plastic waste produced from our operations, but 

also create a public awareness for environmental conservation efforts in Myanmar.




























15 

SMI VANTAGE LIMITED | Sustainability Report 2021 

 

 

 

















Reducing Energy Usage 

 

Therefore, we are committed to taking measures in 

minimizing our overall energy consumption and improving 

energy efficiency to reduce the environmental impact of our 

operations. 

 

In the conduct of our business activities, the main areas of 

electricity usage are predominantly across our offices, 

outlets and warehouse operations. 

 

In FY2021, we have retrofitted conventional mercury lamps 

with more energy efficient LED lightings at our warehouse. 

The LED lightings are approximately 80% more energy 

efficient than the mercury lamps. 

 

 

 

Environmental Compliance 

 

SMI is committed to comply with all applicable environmental regulations enforced by local authorities 

in all jurisdictions we operate in. We closely monitor our operations and perform periodic reviews to 

ensure that we comply with relevant environmental requirements and regulations. 

 

 

Targets 

• Implement more green initiatives to reduce waste output and energy usage. 

• Full compliance with relevant environmental regulations in Myanmar and 

   Singapore.
