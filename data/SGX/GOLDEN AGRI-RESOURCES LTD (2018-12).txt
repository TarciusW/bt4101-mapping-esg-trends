Chairman’s Statement



Sustainability at Golden Agri-Resources 

(GAR) has always been about balancing 

conservation and development. The 

issues faced by the palm oil industry 

are complex and involve engaging 

multiple stakeholders. With no immediate 

quick fixes, cultivating and embedding 

responsible practices requires dedication, 

long-term commitment and patience. To 

guide our approach, we enhanced our 

sustainability commitments in the GAR 

Social and Environmental Policy (GSEP) 

in 2015. We believe that as we maintain 

the course laid out in our sustainability 

roadmap, the GSEP, we will transform 

ourselves and our industry. This year, we 

continued to make progress but still have 

more work ahead as we continue to face 

challenges in some areas.  

Record palm output in 2018

Our plantations delivered 3.05 million 

tonnes of palm product output, a record 

high in GAR’s history. Fruits harvested 

from GAR’s plantation area increased by 

ten percent, resulting in an average yield 

of 22.5 tonnes per hectare, one of the 

highest in the industry. 

Our operational performance was 

however overshadowed by the impact 

of low crude palm oil (CPO) prices as the 

industry experienced a declining trend 

throughout the year. We believe CPO 

prices will gradually improve supported by 

its strong fundamentals and its importance 

for businesses and consumers worldwide.

Indonesia has fully implemented its B20 

biodiesel policy and the significant new 

demand created is supporting the recent 

rebound. Biodiesel was the star performer 

in FY2018 for both our export and 

Indonesia domestic markets.

GAR is moving forward in 2019 with 

greater optimism, leveraging our world-

class palm oil upstream capability and 

our expanding downstream presence in 

producing and merchandising a broad 

range of value-added products globally.

Industry transformation on track

We continued to make headway on 

the transformation of our supply chain. 

More third-party suppliers joined us in 

carrying out Traceability to the Plantation 

(TTP) exercises. As of end 2018, over 50 

third-party suppliers had reported full 

TTP. Together with GAR-owned mills, this 

means that over 60 percent of our palm 

supply chain is fully traceable. 

Traceability means we can guarantee 

the provenance of our raw materials. 

Crucially, it is also key to our wider efforts 

to help our suppliers change for the 

better. Through deeper engagement, 

we are supporting and training our 

suppliers to improve and adopt better 

practices. This helps us reduce supply 

chain risks while making our industry more 

responsible and resilient. A key part of 

our engagement is actively assessing our 

suppliers for compliance with our policies 

and we continued these efforts in 2018, 

completing supplier site visits in all our 

downstream locations.  

We also recognise the importance of 

supporting independent small farmers.

Our Approach

Chairman’s Statement

We actively participate in the Indonesian 

government programme of Perkebunan 

Sawit Rakyat (PSR). The programme aims 

to encourage independent smallholders 

to replant with better quality, high-yielding 

seeds by giving access to financing and 

helping them sustain their livelihoods until 

the trees mature. 

We continue to maintain an area the size 

of Singapore as our conservation area. 

We are bolstering our forest conservation 

efforts through community outreach and 

consultation on Participatory Mapping 

and Participatory Conservation Planning. 

These innovative approaches have now 

matured into long-term processes with 

local communities as we incrementally 

implement our goals and commitments to 

responsible palm oil. 

We are also strategically aligned with 

the UN Sustainable Development Goals 

(SDGs) which aim to achieve a better, 

more sustainable future for the world. We 

are supporting the achievement of targets 

set out in UN SDGs 2, 12 and 15 through 

our initiatives in yield improvement; supply 

chain transformation; landscape forest 

conservation which includes Participatory 

Conservation Planning; long-term fire 

prevention; and biodiversity protection. 

Strengthening other areas

In any long-term transformation process 

there will be occasional setbacks. This 

is normal and allows us to reassess and 

adjust our approaches to solving complex 

matters. One area where we will be doing 

this is our implementation of long-term 

fire prevention with local communities 

in our Desa Makmur Peduli Api (DMPA)  

programme. Early success encouraged us 

to expand the programme to more villages 

in 2018. However, we also note that fire 

incidents increased in some DMPA villages 

last year and we will be looking into the 

causes and ways to address this.

Strengthening Operational Health and 

Safety (OHS) awareness and practices 

throughout our operations is another 

priority, as we note with regret an increase 

in fatal incidents taking place in our 

operations. We intend to create renewed 

energy behind the message that every 

worker deserves to return home safely at 

the end of each day.  

 

Ultimately, we remain committed to this 

long-term effort because we believe that it 

helps our business thrive and create value 

for shareholders, our employees and the 

community. Our Environmental, Social and 

Governance (ESG) performance continues 

to be recognised and we debuted on 

the FTSE4Good Asean 5 and Developed 

indices last year. The NUS Centre for 

Governance, Institutions and Organizations 

has also ranked GAR amongst the top 10 

listed companies in Singapore in terms of 

transparency and sustainability reporting. 

Positive developments for the industry

Looking ahead, with the successful 

implementation of the B20 biodiesel 

programme in Indonesia, we see 

growing enthusiasm from the 

Indonesian Government to achieve a 

higher target of B30. This would be 

an important catalyst to the Indonesia 

palm oil industry in the near-term, 

creating additional demand on top of 

the consumption for food and other 

sectors. Likewise, we note the increasing 

biodiesel demand from large countries 

such as China, considering the higher 

crude oil prices compared to biodiesel 

prices. We are cautiously optimistic that 

this positive atmosphere will promote 

tighter supply and demand for palm 

oil that eventually will have a positive 

impact on CPO prices. Furthermore, 

palm oil will continue to play a key 

role in addressing mounting global 

food demand amidst the limited 

availability of arable land. GAR is eager 

to contribute to the sustainable and 

responsible feeding and fueling of 

future generations through palm oil.

PALM OIL – A COMMODITY THAT POSES BOTH CHALLENGES  

AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 

Palm oil is one of the most misunderstood commodities today. On the one hand, it has 

the highest yield of any oil crop and makes more efficient use of land in its production 

than any other vegetable oils. It is also highly versatile and can be processed to form a 

wide range of products with different melting points, consistencies and characteristics.

In Indonesia, palm oil production has helped to lift millions of rural farmers out of 

absolute poverty. It is estimated that a palm oil farmer can earn up to seven times more 

than a subsistence farmer. Palm oil estates also provide critical infrastructure and facilities 

for rural populations and gives them access to healthcare and education. 

On the other hand, the growth in palm oil production due to increasing demand has 

led to unsustainable practices in parts of the industry, that if unchecked, pose serious 

environmental and social challenges. 

As a leader in the responsible and sustainable production of palm oil, GAR recognises 

these challenges and opportunities and is committed to working collaboratively with all 

stakeholders along our value chain to create a sustainable palm oil industry.

We believe that if done right, palm oil can take the lead, amongst agribusinesses of all 

types, to delink production from deforestation and contribute to a more sustainable 

future which is focused on conserving the environment, ending poverty, providing 

decent work and economic growth, reducing inequalities, and championing responsible 

production and consumption.

Chairman’s Statement



[102-11]  [102-12]  [103-2] 

As an agribusiness operating in Indonesia, 

GAR understands that the long-term 

success of our business relies on adopting 

sustainable business practices. 

We recognise the value of conserving the 

natural environment, which houses rich 

biodiversity and provides vital ecosystem 

services that are crucial to our wellbeing. 

We also recognise that the palm oil 

industry supports millions of livelihoods in 

Indonesia. Progress therefore requires a 

balanced and thoughtful approach.  

At the heart of our approach to 

sustainability is the GAR Social and 

Environmental Policy or the GSEP. The 

GSEP embodies our belief that economic 

growth, social progress and environmental 

protection can go hand-in-hand. 

The GSEP establishes firm commitments 

that support these beliefs and we have 

set stretching targets to drive progress 

against these commitments. Over time 

we will continuously update our approach 

to keep up with emerging concerns and 

trends both globally and locally.

Chairman’s Statement

EXAMPLES OF HOW GAR IS CONTRIBUTING:

The world population is estimated 

to reach 10 billion by 2050. With 

limited land and resources, as 

well as the impacts of climate 

change, ensuring sustainable food 

production systems is crucial. GAR 

is committed to the sustainable 

production of palm oil as a key 

food ingredient, to meet growing 

demand while addressing these 

challenges. We have invested in 

developing higher-yielding seeds 

and planting materials which 

reduce pressure on the need for 

agricultural land expansion. We are 

also investing in R&amp;D to produce 

seeds that are more resilient to the 

increasing threat of droughts and 

diseases from climate change. Our 

focus on productivity and improving 

agronomic practices also extends 

to our plasma and independent 

smallholders, supporting them to 

generate decent incomes, while 

adopting practices that protect 

the environment. (Relates to SDG 

Targets: 2.3; 2.4) 

For more information please see 

p 36 &amp; p 55-56

Achieving responsible consumption 

and production is essential to 

ensure that the natural resources 

we depend on are not depleted 

and used efficiently, while 

minimising the impact to human 

health and the environment. 

For GAR, this means minimising 

waste through recycling and 

reuse, as well as phasing out 

harmful chemical substances in 

our operations. Since 2015, we 

have recycled 100 percent of 

waste from the production of CPO 

in our upstream operations. We 

have stopped using the herbicide 

paraquat, while continuing to use 

a combination of natural solutions 

and biological controls for pests. 

These commitments which are in 

our GSEP also apply to our supply 

chain. (Relates to SDG Targets 

12.2;12.4;12.5)

For more information please see 

p 34-36

Tropical forests provide important 

ecosystem services, host a large 

amount of biodiversity and support 

the livelihood of indigenous 

peoples. As a palm oil company, 

we have an important role to 

play in ensuring the protection of 

forest areas. GAR has identified 

and set aside 72,000 hectares 

of HCS and HCV areas for 

conservation. In addition, we 

have taken a landscape approach 

to conservation, working with 

local communities around and 

beyond our concession areas, 

which includes Participatory 

Mapping (PM) and Participatory 

Conservation Planning (PCP). 

We are also supporting the 

conservation of 65,000 hectares 

of forests by our suppliers. And 

we continue to maintain our 

vigilance on fire prevention and 

management. (Relates to SDG 

Targets 15.1;15.2;15.3;15.5)

For more information please see 

p 28-32 &amp; p 52

To achieve sustainable 

development, partnerships 

between governments, the private 

sector and civil society is required. 

All of our efforts are underpinned 

by local and global partnerships. 

These range from collaborations 

with communities and suppliers 

on conservation; working with top 

research facilities and universities 

on improving biodiversity; 

and with customers to help 

smallholders improve livelihoods 

and sustainability. (Relates to SDG 

Targets 17.16)

In September 2015, the 193 member 

states of the United Nations came 

together to adopt a new agenda for 

sustainable development. The SDGs 

represent an interrelated and holistic 

framework of the most pressing 

challenges facing humanity and which 

require urgent action to ensure a 

sustainable future. 

GAR has a role to play in supporting 

all 17 SDGs. As a palm oil business 

operating in Indonesia, we have chosen 

to focus our efforts on the goals where 

we can make the most strategic and 

meaningful contributions. 

Following an assessment of the goals 

and their underlying targets, we have 

identified four SDGs, which we believe 

align best with our strengths and our 

areas of impact as a company. They also 

represent the greatest opportunity to 

partner with others to drive progress 

towards sustainable development.

[102-23]  [102-26]  [103-2]  

We are committed to the highest 

standards of corporate governance, and 

to complying with the principles of the 

Code of Corporate Governance.

The composition of our board is an 

important part of our approach to 

corporate governance. Currently, the 

Board has eight members, including five 

independent directors, who exercise 

objective judgment in our corporate 

affairs. The board is headed by GAR’s 

Chairman and CEO, Mr Franky O. Widjaja 

and is responsible for overseeing all 

aspects of our business. A full list of our 

board of directors and their profiles can 

be found on our website and in the  

GAR Annual Report.

The board and senior management 

are fully involved in and support GAR’s 

sustainability efforts and commitments 

under the GSEP. A Sustainability 

Committee (SC), which is chaired by Ms 

Jesslyne Widjaja, Corporate Strategy and 

Business Development Director, oversees 

all matters related to responsible palm oil. 

The SC comprises the senior leadership 

team from the upstream, downstream 

and corporate business units as well as 

the head and other staff members of 

the Sustainability Directorate. It reports 

directly to Mr Franky O. Widjaja and meets 

regularly to oversee the development, 

implementation and monitoring of the 

GSEP and our performance across all our 

business operations.    

Over the years we have continued to 

invest additional resources with the aim 

of embedding responsible palm practices 

in our day-to-day operations. The 

Sustainability and Strategic Stakeholder 

Engagement Department has over 400 

staff in Jakarta and in the field. 

As detailed in the Organisation Charts, we 

employ specialists to oversee and handle 

key areas such as conflict resolution, 

HCS/HCV management, fire prevention, 

community consent (FPIC), grievance 

management and health and safety. The 

department also works with colleagues 

in Human Resources on labour issues to 

ensure free and fair labour practices in line 

with the GSEP. 

GAR provides ongoing training for 

employees on the GSEP. In 2018, 7,600 

employees received GSEP training.

Chairman’s Statement

We also have a grievance mechanism 

in place for stakeholders including 

employees to raise grievances involving 

our own operations as well as social 

conflict handling procedures. 

Ethics and compliance 

[102-16]  [102-17]  [205-3]  [415-1]  

At GAR, we are committed to pursuing 

our business objectives with integrity and 

in compliance with the law. We comply 

with applicable laws in all the countries 

in which we do business, including all 

anti-bribery and corruption regulations. 

Additionally, GAR does not make any 

corporate political contributions. 

We expect all our employees, contractors, 

suppliers and business partners to 

adhere to GAR Code of Conduct which 

is communicated to all our existing 

and new employees. The Code is 

purposefully designed to be practically 

applicable to our day-to-day business, 

with definite guidelines on acceptable 

and unacceptable behaviour and also 

applies to the Board members. It also 

details avenues for raising concerns and 

whistleblowing procedures, encouraging 

employees to report any possible 

improprieties in confidence and without 

fear of retaliation.

We take seriously the bribery case in 2018 

involving three officers of PT Binasawit 

Abadipratama (PT BAP), a subsidiary 

of GAR. The Jakarta Corruption court 

has ruled that this incident reflects the 

actions of a few individuals in breach of 

the state regulations as well as GAR’s 

own Code of Conduct, which also applies 

to GAR subsidiaries. As a result of the 

court decision, PT BAP will now take 

appropriate action in relation to the 

employment of those individuals involved 

in the case in line with the Indonesian 

employment law. 

Additionally, GAR took immediate steps 

to internally reinforce the principles of the 

Company’s Code of Conduct. Employees 

were reminded of the Company’s stance 

against corruption and bribery and 

required to complete an e-learning 

course on the Code of Conduct, which 

included testing and mandatory signed 

acknowledgements. Executives were 

also required to sign an Integrity Pact 

committing them to behave ethically 

and comply with prevailing laws and 

regulations.

Monitoring, evaluation and reporting

[103-3]

Under the GSEP we are committed to 

monitoring, evaluating and reporting our 

performance. 

We maintain and regularly update our 

Sustainability Dashboard which is freely 

accessible on our website without a 

separate login. We regularly report our 

progress on several key initiatives such 

as our Traceability to the Plantation (TTP) 

exercise, our progress in resolving social 

conflicts and handling grievances, fire 

incidents and wider sustainability efforts 

on the GAR website and Sustainability 

Dashboard as well as reports such as 

the GAR Annual Report and the GAR 

Sustainability Report. We also participate 

in several disclosure platforms including 

CDP (which incorporates the Task Force 

on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 

(TCFD) recommendations and elements of 

the Accountability Framework Initiative), 

SPOTT, FTSE4Good and DJSI.

Partnerships for responsible palm oil 

All these endeavours require us to 

work closely and engage with multiple 

stakeholders. Partnership (UN SDG 17)  

is the cornerstone of our approach 

to achieving our goals. We do this in 

recognition of our limits as a private 

company and we seek to learn and gain 

valuable input from our stakeholders 

such as local communities, smallholders, 

government, Civil Society Organisations 

(CSOs), suppliers, the Roundtable on 

Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), our industry 

peers and implementation partners.  

 

In several instances, we have worked with 

CSO stakeholders like Greenpeace to 

develop new guidelines and standards 

such as the High Carbon Stock Approach 

(HCSA) to address deforestation concerns. 

This approach is increasingly being 

adopted not only in our industry but also 

in other sectors such as forestry.

The GSEP was developed with feedback 

and input from key stakeholders including 

CSOs such as Greenpeace, Rainforest 

Action Network (RAN), Forest Peoples 

Programme (FPP) and our implementation 

partner, Earthworm Foundation (formerly 

The Forest Trust). We also continue 

to improve our Standard Operating 

Procedures for carrying out FPIC, handling 

grievances, conflict resolution and 

participatory mapping, often with input 

from external stakeholders such as CSOs. 

Responsible handling of complaints  

and grievances 

[103-2]  [103-3]

In 2015, GAR established a Grievance 

Procedure to ensure that as a company, 

we are responsive to any grievances raised 

by external parties which may involve our 

third-party suppliers. It helps us to address 

a wide range of concerns, including those 

related to our most material issues, and 

covers our worldwide operations. The full 

Grievance List can be viewed on our  

Sustainability Dashboard.

Chairman’s Statement



Key to our approach in responsible palm 

oil is our identification and management 

of material issues. This ensures that we 

are prioritising and focusing on the most 

significant economic, environmental, 

social and governance issues that shape 

our success and that are of greatest 

importance to our stakeholders.

In 2017, we worked with specialist 

sustainability consulting firm Corporate 

Citizenship to update and refresh 

our understanding of our material 

sustainability issues. Our approach 

followed the principle of materiality as 

set out in the GRI Standards and included 

the assessment of sustainability issues 

across our entire value chain. We gathered 

a balance of internal and external 

stakeholder perspectives, through a mix 

of qualitative and quantitative methods. 

This included desk research, surveys and 

interviews. The detailed process can be 

seen on the GAR website.

STAKEHOLDER  

ENGAGEMENT

[102-40]  [102-42]  [102-43]

The issues facing palm oil production 

are complex and multi-faceted. This is 

why a key element of our approach to 

responsible palm oil relies on engagement 

and close collaboration with stakeholders.

Our stakeholder engagement focuses on 

trying to better understand stakeholders’ 

needs and concerns. At the same time, 

we want to build our stakeholders’ 

understanding of our business and the 

realities of the palm oil industry on the 

ground. 

We believe that enhanced mutual 

understanding will support the 

development of more effective solutions 

and partnerships, which can better 

balance environmental protection with 

the economic and social needs of our 

stakeholders.  

For more details on our stakeholder 

engagement, see our website.

Some key outcomes of our 

stakeholder engagement:

• Participatory Conservation 

Planning with the community 

(see p 28-29)

• Long-term fire prevention 

programme with the community 

(see p 31-32)

• Supply chain transformation 

(see p 50-56)

• Smallholder support 

programmes (see p 55-56)

• Active participation in the RSPO

OUR ENVIRONMENTAL 

MANAGEMENT

[103-2]  [103-3]

Environmental management has been a key focus for us for many 

decades as we strive to optimise productivity and long-term 

sustainability. Over the years, we have implemented a number 

of pioneering initiatives aimed at forest conservation, protecting 

biodiversity and minimising harmful impacts on the environment. 

Our efforts in this area help contribute to UN SDG 15 which aims 

to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial 

ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, 

halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.

Forest and biodiversity conservation

[304-1]  [304-2]



















Forest protection and biodiversity 

conservation have been a major focus 

of our environmental efforts for many 

years. We have identified and continue to 

conserve 72,000 hectares of land made up 

of High Carbon Stock (HCS) forests and 

High Conservation Value (HCV) areas. Our 

conservation areas are roughly equivalent 

to the size of Singapore and can be 

viewed on the Sustainability Dashboard. 

GAR’s CDP disclosure on forests also 

provides further information on our  

forest-related issues.   

We have taken a landscape approach to 

conservation (beyond the boundaries of 

our concessions), through our community 

conservation partnerships. These began 

in 2015, when we started to formally 

map their villages through Participatory 

Mapping – a process for helping villages 

map out critical areas such as customary 

boundaries and land necessary for food 

security. This map is then lodged with and 

formally recognised by the authorities, 

serving amongst other things to clarify 

land tenure rights and enabling villages to 

gain access to government development 

funds for the first time. 

The mapping lays the foundation for 

further dialogue on conservation through 

our Participatory Conservation Planning 

process. Our intensive consultative 

approach takes into account local 

community concerns, needs and aspirations 

including food security requirements and 

continued ability to earn a decent living 

and maintain stable quality of life. 

We have rolled out mapping in 85 villages 

across our concessions to date. As part 

of our landscape approach to forest 

conservation, we continued to roll out 

our conservation planning programmes 

with local communities. By end 2018, 22 

villages have taken part in participatory 

conservation consultations for joint 

HCS forest conservation projects with 

communities. We have secured agreement 

with local communities in 13 villages to set

Protection-production partnerships support conservation

As part of our community conservation 

partnerships, we have initiated 

development programmes for the local 

communities which participate in the 

conservation partnerships. Integrated 

Ecological Farming projects have been 

launched in 19 villages in West Kalimantan 

and Central Kalimantan and are an 

integral part of programmes like the Peat 

Ecosystem Rehabilitation project and the 

Desa Makmur Peduli Api programme. 

The farming projects aim to help the 

local community achieve food self-

sufficiency, earn extra income as well as 

raise awareness about alternative farming 

methods without the use of fire. 

Each participating family can save up to 

IDR 300,000 per month through planting 

and harvesting their own vegetables. In 

addition, they receive about IDR 500,000 

per month from selling the surplus 

produce to surrounding villages.

Zero Tolerance Policy towards hunting, 

injuring, possessing and killing of rare and 

endangered wildlife. 

We continuously educate our employees, 

local communities and related stakeholders 

on the importance of protecting rare and 

endangered species. GAR also continues 

to work on orangutan conservation as a 

special focus area. We have renewed our 

partnership with Orangutan Foundation 

International (OFI) to rehabilitate and 

release wild-born, formerly captive 

primates. We aim to release another 60 

orangutans by 2021 back into the wild, 

specifically back to the Seruyan Forest 

in Central Kalimantan. In addition, the 

new partnership agreement focuses on 

local community and school education 

programmes on orangutan conservation. 

Read more about our orangutan 

rehabilitation efforts on our website. 

Our management of HCV areas also 

involves the rehabilitation of riparian 

zones that have previously been cleared 

or planted. These riparian buffer zones 

have particular ecological importance, 

providing specific wildlife habitats and 

playing a key role in water systems.  

Since 2015, GAR has been implementing 

a riparian rehabilitation programme in its 

18 concessions. As of end 2018, we have 

rehabilitated over 2,700 hectares and the 

riparian zones have been replanted with 

native trees and vegetation. 

We are also participating in research 

with Cambridge University on riparian 

zone rehabilitation. Results will provide 

We have also used this model of

Long-term prevention of fire and haze

[103-2]  [103-3] 

Insect biodiversity in palm oil plantations

Recent studies have shown that key insects which help pollinate crops such as bees, 

butterflies and beetles could disappear in the next 25 – 30 years. 

But it is not widely known that established palm oil plantations can still house a 

surprisingly diverse and abundant insect population. Maintaining and enhancing 

biodiversity especially of insects, arachnids and other small creatures is a particular 

focus of R&amp;D being carried out by GAR’s SMART Research Institute (SMARTRI) in 

collaboration with Cambridge and Southampton universities. Read more in our blog 

and on the BEFTA website.

We continue to maintain our vigilance on 

fire prevention and management. We have 

more than 10,000 fire fighters on standby 

across all our plantations. Our estates 

are also equipped with fire-fighting 

equipment.   

In 2018, there were virtually zero 

fires in GAR areas. Fire incidents for 

GAR concessions (including plasma 

smallholders’ area) are reported weekly  

on our Sustainability Dashboard. 

Outside our own concessions, we continue 

the implementation of our community 

collaboration programme on long-term 

fire prevention – Desa Makmur Peduli Api 

(DMPA). In 2018, DMPA was rolled out 

to 15 more villages. Aside from training 

and equipping local community members 

to suppress fires rapidly, we also work 

with schools to educate the younger 

generation and drive long-term change  

in the community.

Reducing GHG emissions

[103-2]  [103-3]

We are committed to reducing 

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from 

our operations. 

We recognise that emissions resulting 

from land-use change and cultivation 

is naturally one of the most significant 

impacts for any agribusiness. Our 

conservation of HCS forests which retain 

large stores of carbon is one way we are 

contributing to avoidance of emissions. 

We also carry out methane capture at 

some of our mills.  

To better understand our footprint and 

the opportunities to reduce it, we have 

conducted a baseline study of our GHG 

emissions in our mills and plantations.  

EY was commissioned to review and verify 

how we calculate our carbon footprint, 

identify viable opportunities to reduce 

emissions and set short, medium and 

long-term reduction targets for the 

business. Having completed the baseline, 

we are in the process of designing an 

emission reduction strategy. Please refer 

to SR2017 for information on the baseline 

calculations. 

Life Cycle Assessment for  

GHG emissions

In 2018, we supplemented our 

baseline study by conducting a 

lifecycle assessment of our CPO, PK, 

and PKO products in Indonesia. The 

aim of this was to better understand, 

where the most significant impacts and 

opportunities for reduction are in our 

upstream operations. It is based on  

five years of operational data from  

45 mills and 129 supplying estate,  

26 nurseries and one seed production 

plant and excludes land use change 

calculations. Life Cycle Assessment 

software was used in the calculation. 

Based on the assessment, Palm Oil Mill 

Effluent (POME) contributes the most 

GHG emissions (45%), followed by 

fertiliser (39%) and diesel fuel (15%). 

Emissions measured included CO2,

Waste recycling and reuse

[103-2]  [103-3] 

Under our Zero Waste Policy we aim to 

reuse, recover and recycle. Since 2015,  

we have achieved 100 percent recycling of 

waste from the CPO production process in 

our upstream operations. 

The waste includes solid and liquid 

waste. Solid waste consists of empty fruit 

bunches (EFB) of oil palm, fibre and shells. 

Liquid waste or Palm Oil Mill Effluent 

(POME) is generated from the processing 

of FFB to CPO. We use both types of 

waste as organic fertiliser and fuel.

Our downstream waste is disposed of 

through municipal landfills or incinerators. 

Hazardous waste is collected for proper 

disposal by authorised third-parties.

R&amp;D on soil fertility

Our upstream R&amp;D facility, SMARTRI, is increasing research and monitoring 

related to the physical fertility of soils. This is important in light of the current 

trend to develop mechanisation of several field practices, especially regarding 

relatively heavy jobs such as moving and applying fertiliser and removing FFB 

from the fields. Mechanisation can lead to risk of soil compaction due to repeated 

runs of tractors with a potential risk of damaging the physical fertility of soils. 

SMARTRI is measuring several indicators of soil biological activities and studying 

the links between agricultural practices and biological fertility components. 

Biological activities in soil are widely recognised as playing a vital part in nutrient 

cycling and availability to plants and in developing and maintaining soil structure, 

and contributing to soil health. 

An example of such a measurement would be looking at how a good soil 

vegetation cover that reduces run-off and erosion results in a higher biological 

activity as measured through the population of insects as well as measurements of 

soil feeding activities of soil micro and meso fauna. 

Over the years, SMARTRI’s recommended practice of spreading cut oil palm 

fronds on the soil surface has resulted in the presence of more insects and it also 

facilitates their feeding activities. Similarly, recycling empty fruit bunches, fresh  

or after composting, also enhances soil feeding activities of insects, a good 

indicator of soil health.

Managing our water footprint 

[103-2]  [103-3]

Water is a vital resource for our operations 

and the communities where we operate. 

We recognise that water availability is 

becoming an increasingly important issue 

in the face of climate change and we are 

looking at ways to minimise our water 

footprint. 

We strive to meet all our water needs 

through surface water that is processed 

to meet the quality standards required for 

the production process and use ground 

water only in very limited quantities 

in locations where no surface water is 

available. We continue to improve our 

water efficiency by recycling and reusing 

where appropriate. 

Oil palm trees require adequate amounts 

of water in order to grow. As such we 

have not developed plantations in water-

stressed areas and our plantations are 

rain-fed and not irrigated. 

We also take steps to minimise any 

risk of pollution of surface and ground 

water, following strict land management 

practices that are designed to reduce 

these risks. In particular, we do not apply 

herbicides, chemicals or POME (which is 

treated and used as organic fertiliser) near 

and around rivers and riparian zones; and 

we plant vetiver grass to minimise soil 

erosion. We submit water sample analyses 

to the environmental agencies at least 

twice yearly. 

We have noted the increasing occurrence 

of extreme weather phenomena like El 

Niño which can lead to severe draught. 

We are now exploring ways to optimise 

water use in our plantations through the 

use of advanced technology including AI. 

For more information on our water footprint 

please see our CDP disclosure on water. 

Maintaining soil fertility 

[103-2]  [103-3]

GAR implements best agricultural 

management practices to maintain 

and enhance soil fertility through 

a comprehensive mineral nutrition 

management plan. We aim to minimise 

the quantity of fertiliser applied while 

maximising yields. This reduces the 

pressure to open more land and minimises 

the risk of soil degradation from oil palm 

cultivation.

We have SOPs which specify that the 

use of fertilisers should be tailored to 

the texture of the soil and its capacity for 

retaining nutrients; that fertilisers should 

not be applied during periods of heavy 

rain; and that there should always be an 

appropriate interval between applications. 

We also recycle palm fronds and other 

organic products to increase the fixing 

capacity of soils.

OUR ENVIRONMENTAL 

MANAGEMENT

Integrated Pest Management

[103-2]  [103-3]

We have adopted an Integrated Pest 

Management (IPM) approach which 

combines cultural, mechanical, biological 

and chemical means to control pests while 

minimising economic, public health and 

environmental risks.

Natural solutions and biological controls are 

our preferred method for controlling pests 

across all our plantations, including beneficial 

plants that attract parasitoids to control 

pests, pathogens or bacteria, and natural 

predators. We supplement this approach 

using handpicking and mechanical traps. 

IPM and selective weed control are the 

basis of the utilisation of pesticides in  

GAR plantations:

• 

Insecticides and rodenticides are 

used only as a final resort, when the 

population of herbivories and rat are 

above an acceptable level and are no 

longer controllable through natural or 

biological solutions.

• 

The utilisation of herbicides is mainly 

to maintain an appropriate access to 

the palms, for their maintenance and 

for harvesting. A selective strategy 

is implemented in order to minimise 

the use of herbicides.

• 

In addition, SMARTRI is continuously 

looking for alternative solutions in 

order to reduce the utilisation of 

herbicides, through the utilisation of 

more efficient and less environmental 

damaging new molecules, or through 

innovative products.

Due to this approach we recorded a 

significant reduction of 23 percent of the 

total pesticides used in 2018 compared to 

the previous years. 

In 2016, GAR stopped using paraquat. In 

addition, pesticides that are categorised 

as World Health Organization Class 1A 

or 1B, or that are listed by the Stockholm 

or Rotterdam Conventions are not used, 

except in specific situations identified in 

national best practice guidelines, such as 

during an extreme pest infestation. 

In parallel to minimising the use of 

chemical pesticides, GAR is promoting 

the use of biopesticides, to enhance the 

health condition of the soils and the  

palm trees. 

Yield improvement

Examples of this include barn owls, which 

are bred on our estates, to control the 

rat population; leaf-eating caterpillars 

are controlled through diversity of flora 

and encouraging beneficial plants; 

and pheromones are used to control 

rhinoceros beetles.

of pesticides

Super high-yielding 

non-GMO clonals 

Eka 1 and Eka 2 can

Improving yields of oil palm is a key part 

of our long-term strategy for responsible 

and sustainable agriculture. The ability 

to obtain higher yields from existing 

agricultural land through better seed 

stock means higher revenue for farmers, 

lessening the need to open new land for 

agriculture. 

Following the development and launch  

of the super high-yielding clonals Eka 1  

and Eka 2 capable of producing over 

10 tonnes/hectare/year of CPO in 2017, 

SMARTRI and SMART Biotechnology

documents submitted to the Government 

of Indonesia. 

Assessment of the environmental 

parameters is conducted by SMARTRI,  

our ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 17025 

accredited internal laboratory, as well 

as external laboratories referred by the 

Indonesian authorities.

Our regular internal monitoring and

PROPER achievement 

Since 2007, GAR has participated in the 

Indonesian Ministry of Environment’s 

national public environmental reporting 

initiative known as the Programme for 

Pollution Control, Evaluation and Rating 

(PROPER). The programme uses a 

colour-coded rating to assess water and 

air pollution control, hazardous waste 

management and environmental impact. 

PROPER also considers other indicators, 

including the impact of a company’s 

community development programmers; 

progress of biodiversity conservation 

efforts; efficiency of water management; 

and innovations in emissions reduction, 

waste management and energy efficiency. 

In 2018, 30 of our mills passed the 

PROPER assessment with Blue rating.  

Four of our downstream facilities have  

also achieved Blue rating. 

To ensure that we are aligned with PROPER 

requirements, internal audits and training 

are carried out in the company’s mills.

ENGAGING AND EMPOWERING  

THE COMMUNITY

[413-1]  

In the past few decades, the palm oil 

sector has played a critical role in helping 

to raise incomes and improve livelihoods 

of small farmers in tropical developing 

countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. 

Communities living in rural remote areas 

in particular have benefitted from palm oil 

development. 

As one of the largest palm oil companies 

in Indonesia, we have created thousands 

of jobs in rural and remote areas. We have 

also helped provide public infrastructure 

such as roads, bridges, community halls 

and places of worship. Prior to developing 

an estate, we carry out Environmental 

and Social Impact Assessments (EIA

and SIA). The results are shared with the 

local communities. All our plantations 

also have social community engagement 

and development plans. This has helped 

advance the aims of UN SDGs especially 

in terms of tackling poverty, improving 

infrastructure and reducing inequalities. 

At the same time, we recognise that 

the establishment of plantations creates 

changes for local communities and 

indigenous people. As stated in the 

GSEP, we are committed to respecting 

human rights and fulfilling Free, Prior and 

Informed Consent (FPIC) requirements 

before any operations begin. GAR is also 

committed to improving its processes and

procedures with regards to respecting the 

customary rights of local and indigenous 

communities. 

Respecting human rights and Free,  

Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) 

[103-2]  [103-3]  [411-1]

FPIC is a central tenet of the GSEP and 

part of our commitment to upholding 

human and community rights. We 

implement FPIC in all our plantations. 

Respecting FPIC means we ensure that 

decision-making by indigenous peoples 

and local communities regarding the 

presence of our operations is done 

without pressure and intimidation (free), 

performed before an activity that has 

impact on the surrounding communities 

is carried out (prior), and with sufficient 

knowledge about the activity and its 

impact on the surrounding communities 

(informed), so they may express 

agreement or disagreement to such 

activity (consent).

Our rollout of Participatory Mapping (PM) 

seeks to ensure FPIC is implemented 

properly. See the section on Environmental 

Management for further details. Further 

information about PM can also be viewed 

on our website. 

We continue to carry out FPIC remediation 

in our concessions in Central and West 

Kalimantan following feedback that initial 

FPIC requirements were not fully met 

with local CSO, LINKS and Ekologika 

consultants. It involves fresh consultations 

with local communities and conducting PM 

to ensure that the community’s land rights 

are fully respected. 

In 2018, there were no incidents of FPIC 

violations or violations of the rights of 

indigenous peoples.

See our SOP on FPIC on our Sustainability 

Dashboard. 

Responsible conflict resolution

Our policies and practices are designed 

to minimise the likelihood of any 

conflicts arising from our operations. 

However, when these conflicts do arise, 

we are committed to working towards a 

responsible resolution.

Our conflict management system maps 

all conflicts related to our operations and 

develops action plans to address them. It 

incorporates transparent monitoring and 

reporting, the option for local community 

Participatory Mapping:

85 villages 

since 2015



and customary groups to access 

independent legal and technical advice, 

the ability for complainants to choose 

individuals or groups to support them or 

act as observers, as well as the option of 

a third party mediator. We categorically 

reject the use of violence in any dispute. 

Our SOP for conflict resolution can be 

viewed on our Sustainability Dashboard. 

Investing in communities 

[103-2]  [103-3] 

GAR aims to help communities and 

multiply the positive impacts of the palm 

oil business through a range of education, 

healthcare, social and economic 

programmes. 

Aside from government agencies and 

local communities, we work with the Eka 

Tjipta Foundation (a non-profit social 

organisation founded by the family of the 

late Eka Tjipta Widjaja in 2006) and the 

Tzu Chi Foundation in Indonesia (affiliated 

with the non-denominational global Tzu 

Chi organisation established in Taiwan) on 

some of these programmes.

THE COMMUNITY

We help improve the well-being of 

local communities by providing access 

to healthcare in remote and rural areas 

and we currently mobilise 240 medical 

personnel at over 150 clinics which serve 

approximately 300 patients daily. Our other 

annual programmes include free medical 

and dental services to 3,600 patients and 

other initiatives as illustrated above.

Promoting small and micro enterprises

Our operations and plantations play an 

important role as an economic driver 

and multiplier and have helped in the 

development of various businesses in the 

remote areas of Indonesia. 

We actively help promote small and micro 

enterprises that contribute to increased 

income for the community. One such 

programme is our ongoing goat breeding 

programme in eight villages around PT Ivo 

Mas Tunggal in Riau. The company has 

donated 160 goats to the villages to date. 

Local communities are able to earn extra 

income through the sale of milk and meat. 

As the villagers breed more goats, these 

will then be given to a Farmers Group in 

another village to grow and expand the 

scheme.   

Our employees in the community 

4,200 

people donated blood

We involve and mobilise our staff 

for various causes. For example, we 

urge employees and tenants at our 

corporate headquarters in Jakarta and 

our operations units in Bangka, Belitung, 

Central Kalimantan, South Kalimantan, 

East Kalimantan, Lampung, Riau and 

West Kalimantan to participate in regular 

blood donation drives for the Indonesian 

Red Cross. Some 4,200 blood donors 

comprising employees and members of 

local community participated in 2018. 

We also encourage our employees to 

contribute funds regularly to the Tzu Chi 

Foundation. A dedicated team oversees 

the distribution and responsible use of 

these donations. 

at all levels for children living near and 

around our estates. 

In line with the nine years of compulsory 

education required by the Indonesian 

government, we ensure that each estate 

has educational facilities ranging from 

kindergarten to sixth grade. Additionally, 

we make sure that every region has a 

junior high school for the children of 

our employees and local communities. 

Currently GAR supports over 250 schools 

with over 2,100 teachers for more than 

36,000 students across our concessions. 

We also donated books and educational 

materials to over 6,000 students. 

In 2018, we also provided around  

USD $1.9 million in scholarships for higher 

education at Indonesian and international 

universities and institutes. 

We have also constructed 36 Rumah Pintar 

or Smart Houses since 2011 to support 

community training programmes. Each 

Rumah Pintar has a library and play room 

and is equipped with computers. There is 

a particular focus on early childhood and 

women’s education.

Chairman’s Statement



The palm oil industry supports economic 

growth, especially in rural areas, helping 

to lift incomes and living standards 

of farming communities. We create 

employment for about 171,700 people 

in Indonesia including 69,400 plasma 

scheme smallholders. 

Improving employment opportunities

Traditionally, the sector employed a large 

portion of workers on a fixed-term basis 

due to the seasonal nature of oil palm 

cultivation. To improve workers’ conditions 

and opportunities, GAR is progressively 

transitioning fixed-term workers, who 

meet hiring requirements, to permanent 

staff status, based on their skills and 

qualifications. By becoming permanent 

staff, employees will have more stable 

incomes and improved job opportunities. 

This process is in line with our GSEP 

commitment to improve workers’ rights 

and conditions and various NGOs 

demands to improve workers’ job security  

in the sector.

Diversity and gender equality 

[103-2]  [103-3]  [406-1]

We believe in promoting gender equality 

in the workplace. However, the manual 

nature of agricultural work means that 

there is a clear division of tasks between 

male and female workers in certain jobs. 

For instance, male workers perform 

heavier physical tasks such as harvesting 

FFB (which can weigh between 23 - 27 kg) 

and carrying them to trucks for transport 

to the mills. Women generally work on 

weeding and collecting loose fruits that 

have fallen on the ground. 

Traditional rural employment patterns 

also mean that many women prefer 

to take on part-time jobs, as it gives 

them the flexibility and time for other 

responsibilities such as childcare; looking 

after the household; tending family 

gardens and other income-earning 

businesses.  

We have zero tolerance for sexual 

harassment and we conduct extensive 

training and socialisation for all estate and 

mill workers to ensure this is understood. 

Gender committees with representatives 

from labour unions and management 

have been set up to promote female 

participation and advancement in the 

workplace. These committees also 

handle sexual harassment complaints. 

When a case of harassment is reported 

either formally or informally, the relevant 

committee investigates the situation to 

determine whether further sanctions or 

law enforcement actions are needed. 

During the investigation, the committee 

also provides assistance and support to 

the victim. In 2018, no significant cases of 

harassment or abuse were reported.

 

Paying fair wages and employee 

benefits

[103-2]  [103-3]  [401-2]  [403-6]

We are committed to ensuring that all 

employees of GAR receive a wage that is 

equal to or above the minimum wage set 

for their respective province, in addition to 

a range of additional benefits. 

Minimum wages in Indonesia are set 

by provincial and district authorities, 

by taking into account the local prices 

of goods and services and the amount 

therefore required for living.

In terms of benefits, full-time workers 

receive free healthcare for themselves 

and their family, company housing, water, 

electricity and free education for their 

children from kindergarten to junior high. 

GAR also provides its full-time workers 

with basic necessities such as rice.

 

Our part-time workers receive free medical 

services at our polyclinics and their 

children have access to education at our 

estate schools.

In the impacted areas, GAR welcomes 

interested fixed-term workers who want to 

undergo the selection process to become 

permanent staff subject to meeting the 

required criteria for the job. The process 

will include basic requirement assessment 

(good working performance, legal identity 

document and passing health test) 

followed by further assessment by the 

recruitment committee.  

GAR has complied with all labour 

regulations during this exercise including 

fulfilling severance payments for affected 

workers. GAR has also worked closely with 

the relevant government agencies during 

this transition. This process has also been 

fully explained to the affected workers.

[103-2]  [103-3]  [409-1]

We believe in the fair, equal and respectful 

treatment for all our employees. Through 

the GSEP, we have also reinforced our 

commitment to ensuring that the rights 

of all people working in our operations 

are respected. The company also fully 

complied with local, national and ratified 

international laws. We adhere to all 

Indonesian labour laws covering issues 

such as freedom of association for our 

employees, decent pay and working hours, 

non-discrimination and the complete 

elimination of child and forced labour. 

Where legal frameworks are not yet in 

place we defer to the International Labour 

Organisation’s Declaration on Fundamental 

Principles and Rights at Work. 

Our commitment to fair labour practices 

is also emphasised in our company Code 

of Conduct and employment practices. 

We have an equal opportunities policy 

on employment, banning discrimination 

based on race, national origin, religion, 

disability, gender, sexual orientation, 

union membership and political affiliation. 

Employees enter into employment freely. 

We do not require our employees to 

deposit identity papers or money. 

We are also engaging our supply chain on 

our labour standards, including prohibiting 

child labour, as part of our efforts to 

help them comply with the GSEP and 

adopt responsible practices. For more 

information on how we respect human 

rights in our supply chain, see the section 

on Transforming our Supply Chain.

Prohibiting child labour

[408-1]

In accordance to the regulation, the 

minimum age for employment in GAR 

in any capacity is 18 years. We aim to 

prevent all forms of child labour, and we 

rigorously enforce these principles at all 

our plantations, mills and other places of 

work. Our recruitment officers verify all 

required documents such as identification 

cards and school diplomas, to ensure 

that we do not employ children. We also 

provide schools and day care centres 

for our workers’ children to ensure that 

parents have somewhere safe to send 

their children and do not feel the need to 

take their children to work with them.

regularly in bipartite forums, to discuss 

and resolve issues. In 2018, there were 

195 labour unions in each operational

with national regulations. In 2018, more 

than 660 of our employees received OHS 

training conducted and certified by Ministry 

of Manpower of the Republic of Indonesia.

Each of our units has an OHS Supervisory 

Committee, which promotes co-operation 

between management and employees 

on OHS and complies with Law No. 1 of 

1970 on Occupational Safety. On average, 

the committees for our plantations and 

mills have 40 members, with 60 percent 

worker representation. The committee 

meets monthly to review OHS data and 

performance. Monthly safety briefings are 

held for employees.

 

Additionally, our Indonesian operations 

under SMART are certified under the 

SMK3 (Sistem Manajemen Keselamatan 

dan Kesehatan Kerja) OHS management 

system, in recognition of good OHS 

management and implementation. 

Fifteen mills and one estate have been 

reviewed and certified under SMK3. These 

certifications are valid for three years and a 

fresh audit is carried out prior to renewal. 

Fatalities

[403-2]  [403-9]

This year we regret to report that we 

recorded 11 fatalities including that of 

two contractors. (There are over 171,000 

people working for us in our Indonesian 

operations, not including contractors.)  

We have unfortunately seen an upward 

trend of work-related fatalities. We take 

the health and safety of our employees 

and contractors very seriously and to 

address this, we have investigated each 

accident thoroughly and implemented 

various action plans to safeguard against 

future occurrences. We will work on 

instilling stronger OHS awareness and 

practices throughout our operations 

to create renewed energy behind the 

message that every worker deserves to 

return home safely at the end of each day.    

The main types of work-related injuries 

include road accidents, being struck by 

falling FFB, falls and electrocutions. 

We assess work-related hazards through 

Hazard Identification and Risk Analysis 

and by conducting OHS Cross Inspection 

to record unsafe actions and conditions. 

Examples include no/inadequate covers 

on rotating objects, lack of employee 

awareness and knowledge. The Safety 

Committee meeting will consider these 

hazards and risks and determine suitable 

action to address gaps such as additional 



OUR

Our Occupational Health and Safety 

(OHS) management system is aimed at

and other negative health impacts and 

covers all employees. The OHS systems 

that we implement are based on national 

and international frameworks. National 

requirements include Indonesian national 

OHS standards (regulation no. 50 (2012)). 

We also base our OHS system on various 

certifications including ISO 14001, OHSAS 

18001 and ISO 45001. Sustainable palm

training; reviewing/strengthening safety 

SOPs; and ensuring Personal Protective 

Equipment is adequate and is worn. 

Security guards 

[410-1] 

The safety of our workers and their families 

is of utmost importance, particularly in 

isolated rural areas. We employ security 

guards for our operations in Indonesia 

to ensure that the plantations and 

surrounding communities are secure.  

Our security guards are required to 

undergo a 21-day comprehensive training 

programme by the Bhakti Manunggal Karya 

Centre of Education and Training (BMK). 

Upon completion, they receive a certificate 

from the Indonesian National Police. The 

programme covers human rights standards 

as well as professional ethics.

Our security guards do not carry firearms 

but are equipped with standard defensive 

security tools such as batons and handcuffs.

Healthcare and well-being 

[403-6] 

We are committed to providing our entire 

workforce with access to healthcare, 

including in remote rural areas where 

there is less incentive for healthcare 

professionals to practice. All our estates 

have polyclinics where workers can get 

free healthcare. We have over 150 clinics 

and approximately 240 medical personnel 

providing medical services for our workers.  

The medical care that our facilities provide 

includes pre-employment medical check-

ups for new recruits, and special medical 

check-ups for workers who are exposed 

to potential health and safety hazards. 

The medical check-up programme is part 

of our effort to prevent and treat work-

related illnesses through early detection.

To promote employee wellness, talks on 

various health topics are held regularly, for 

example on the dangers of HIV and drug 

addiction. Information is also disseminated 

regarding ergonomics and work fatigue.  

All our downstream facilities have 

Occupational Health Service Centres.  

The centres conduct Health Risk 

Assessments (HRA) annually to identify 

occupational health hazards and establish 

control measures to minimise such risks. 

Training and developing our people’s skills

[103-2]  [103-3]  [404-2]  [404-3]

GAR sees training and development as an 

investment that delivers benefits to both 

employees and the employer.

We spent a total of USD 4.6 million in 

2018 on training and development in our 

Indonesian operations. We deliver training 

both formally and informally, with the 

formal training curriculum taught at six 

regional training centres across Indonesia. 

Our training and development 

programmes have two main objectives: 

equipping employees with the skills 

and capabilities they need to excel in 

their roles at GAR, and ensuring that all 

employees embrace our corporate values. 

Our learning and development 

department works closely with our 

business leaders to identify training needs 

and develop high quality training materials 

and programmes to meet those needs.

Training is compulsory for management 

employees at every level starting from 

the Basic Management Development 

Programme for new hires to the 

Supervisory Management Development 

programme, Middle Management 

Development Programme and Executive 

Development Programme. The Individual 

Development Plan and Staff Development 

Discussion provided by Talent Centre are 

trainings that are offered regularly for 

all employees, with public training also 

available to those requiring additional, 

external training.

Other training programmes include 

sales training, managerial coaching as 

well as improving and ensuring product 

knowledge through e-learning and training.

TRANSFORMING 

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN



Our commitment to responsible palm 

oil requires us to work closely with 

our supply chain to ensure they too 

operate responsibly and in line with our 

commitments in the GSEP. This helps to 

minimise supply chain risks for GAR and 

contributes to a palm industry that is more 

responsible and resilient. Our supply chain 

transformation efforts also contribute to 

targets under UN SDGs 12 and 15.

Our palm supply chain

[102-9] 

The bulk of our procurement comprises 

crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel 

(PK) for our downstream business in 

Indonesia. In 2018, these raw materials 

were sourced from 403 third-party mills 

and 46 GAR-owned mills in Indonesia. 

The feedstock for the mills or fresh fruit 

bunches (FFB) are in turn supplied by our 

own nucleus estates, third-party estates, 

thousands of individual farmers (plasma 

and independent), as well as brokers and 

agents who buy from farmers. Procurement 

of CPO and PK, and procurement of FFB, 

accounts for around 74 and 10 percent 

respectively of our Indonesian subsidiaries’ 

procurement spend. 

These producers of FFB, CPO and PK 

make up GAR’s critical suppliers and we 

are focused on helping them transform 

and operate more responsibly.

Other suppliers

[102-9]  [204-1]

Aside from our palm supply chain, we 

procure a number of other products and 

services to run our business. Of our non-

palm procurement, our most significant 

spend for our upstream operations is on 

fertilisers sourced from 33 Indonesian 

companies. Other procurement spend 

categories include materials, spare parts 

and services; chemicals; packaging; fuel 

and tires; food; tools and consumables. 

The procurement of food such as rice, 

noodles and milk is for our employees and 

forms part of their non-monetary benefits. 

In 2018, we spent about IDR 120 billion to 

procure over 12 Kilo tonnes of food.

Over 55 percent of products and 

services are purchased by our local and 

representative offices from local vendors 

close to our operational sites. We also 

support many small businesses and 

suppliers with more 80 percent of our 

procurement sourced from small vendors.

Traceability to the Plantation

[103-2]  [103-3]

Working closely with our critical tier 

one suppliers, represented by over 400 

third-party mills, we continued to make 

progress on achieving full Traceability to 

the Plantation (TTP) or origin for our raw 

materials. This is a notable achievement 

given that agricultural supply chains are 

notoriously complex. 

As at end 2018, we recorded full TTP for 

54 third-party suppliers. Together with 

the TTP of GAR-owned mills, we achieved 

full traceability for 62 percent of our 

key supply chain, putting us on track to 

achieve full TTP by 2020.  

Traceability is a crucial first step for us in 

relationship building with our third-party 

suppliers. Through engagement and 

gaining their trust, we have been able to 

spearhead our supply chain transformation 

efforts. 

Our efforts in this area are translating into 

tangible results. One such example can 

be seen in forest conservation. Through 

our engagement with our suppliers 

and the sharing of best practices and 

commitments to no deforestation, we are 

currently supporting the conservation of 

65,000 hectares of HCS and HCV areas  

by our suppliers.

Supplier assessment, support and training

[308-1]  [308-2]  [414-1]  [414-2]

In 2018, aside from commercial 

considerations, we also screened 60 

potential new supplier mills based on 

environmental and social criteria through 

spatial analysis and desk research1. Out of 

these, 16 mills qualified as GAR suppliers. 

We also assess existing suppliers for 

GSEP compliance and follow up with 

engagement efforts as required. We have 

completed site visits to all our downstream 

processing locations and reports can be 

viewed on the Sustainability Dashboard. 

We also assessed all our 403 third-party 

mill suppliers through desk research and  

visited 25 of them in 2018.  

 

Through our site visits and assessments 

since 2015, we have determined that 86 

suppliers are compliant with the GSEP. 

In 2018, the 25 mills we visited had 

significant impacts in the following areas:  

 

• 

Environmental: waste management, 

potential for deforestation and GHG 

emissions 

• 

Social: labour practices, OHS and 

implementation of FPIC 

All the assessed mills are working on their 

remedial action plans with more than half 

of these mills showing good progress2.

Suppliers who are participating in 

the assessment process are generally 

receptive to proposals for improvement 

and we have not had to disengage from 

any of the suppliers assessed. However, 

suppliers deemed non-compliant will 

no longer form part of our supply chain. 

Since 2015 we have stopped procuring 

from about seven percent of our suppliers 

due to non-compliance with our GSEP 

commitments. 

We operate a transparent and accountable 

system where stakeholders can inform us 

of issues within our supply chain using our 

grievance process. As part of this process, 

we conduct ad-hoc site visits where an 

issue has been raised by an external 

stakeholder or discovered through our 

own monitoring. Our engagement is 

reported in our updated Grievance List. 

In 2018, 12 new grievances were raised 

related to our third-party suppliers with 

five resolved. We also closed another ten 

cases from previous years. Case studies 

which highlight action plans for our 

suppliers are published on our website 

and Sustainability Dashboard. 

We continue to extend support and 

training to our suppliers through SMART 

SEED and SPOT (Sustainable Palm Oil 

Training) workshops. Topics include 

current issues such as labour and human 

rights and traceability. As part of our 

continuous support to our suppliers, a 

dedicated GAR Supplier Support Team 

is available to respond to queries from 

suppliers. They can be reached at supplier.

Chairman’s Statement

Insights from site visits to tier one and tier two suppliers around Lubuk Gaung Refinery 

and Dumai Bulking Station:

Overarching issues faced by all suppliers 

We found that all 21 mills, 24 estates and 26 smallholders assessed had challenges in 

fulfilling most of the principles set forth in the GSEP. This is largely due to: 

• 

Lack of understanding of sustainability as a strategic asset 

 

Suppliers had yet to fully embrace sustainability as a key differentiator in the market 

place and link their organisation’s values to triple bottom line concerns: social, 

environmental and financial. Push factors from market players related to socialising 

sustainability policies across suppliers as well as pull factors such as offering 

rewards for sustainable practices, have also not yet been optimally rolled out. 

•  

Absence of sustainability systems and policies 

 

While suppliers had developed some procedures related to sustainability, they 

were often developed merely to pursue compliance with regulation or other 

acceptable norms. Suppliers had not yet developed integrated sustainability 

policies that move beyond basic regulations or institutionalised them into their 

operational practices. 

•  

Limited structural organisational support 

 

Lack of internal leadership to catalyse and integrate sustainability within  

their organisation has prevented suppliers from adopting a clear vision and  

the necessary focus to embrace sustainability. Suppliers demonstrated an  

insular culture and an unwillingness to collaborate with their peers to find  

multi-stakeholder solutions. 

In order for suppliers to close gaps in complying with the GSEP, embedding all three 

elements into their modus operandi is essential to ensure their transformation journey will 

not be shortlived and will continue to contribute long term and sustainability benefits.

Chairman’s Statement

Supporting smallholders

[103-2]  [103-3]

Smallholders form a large proportion of 

the palm oil industry and control more 

than 40 percent of palm oil estates 

in Indonesia. There are an estimated 

two million small farmers in Indonesia 

alone. Helping smallholders improve 

their livelihoods as well as adopt more 

responsible practices is one of the major 

challenges in the industry. 

We have been supporting and helping 

all our plasma smallholders achieve 

responsible palm oil for almost three 

decades. In 2018, around 69,400 plasma 

smallholders supplied FFB to GAR, about 

22 percent of our total intake of FFB. 

While GAR does not own the plasma 

plantations, they are closely integrated 

into our management system and we 

take the lead in promoting their success 

while adhering to the GSEP. In 2018, 

our smallholders achieved a CPO yield 

of around 5.2 tonnes per hectare, which 

is among the highest in the industry in 

Indonesia.

Through our partnership, we provide 

our plasma smallholders access to high-

yielding seeds and good quality fertilisers. 

We also ensure knowledge transfer and 

capacity building through regular training 

on Good Agricultural Practices. 

We are also extending support to 

independent smallholders. These farmers 

usually have small plots and due to the 

lack of access to quality seeds and best 

agronomic practices, generally produce 

very low yields. Inefficient production 

negatively impacts a farmer’s livelihood 

which can lead to increased pressure to 



clear more forests for agriculture in the 

hopes of boosting earnings. 

One of the ways in which we continue 

to tackle this is through our support of 

the Innovative Financing scheme for 

independent smallholders. The programme 

aims to encourage more independent 

smallholders to replant with better quality, 

higher-yielding seed by giving them access 

to financing and helping them sustain their 

livelihoods during the four years it takes for 

the new seedlings to mature. 

More independent smallholders joined the 

Innovative Financing scheme in 2018. 

Since the scheme began in 2014, GAR 

has helped independent farmers in Riau 

and Jambi secure loans of approximately 

IDR 240 billion from state-owned banks. 

As at end 2018, around 1,400 farmers had 

enrolled in the scheme. 

 

Concurrently we run other finance and 

support programmes for independent 

smallholders. Through the Smallholders 

Development Programme, GAR has

provided technical assistance and long 

tenure interest-free credit to more than 

2,800 independent farmers in East 

Kalimantan since 2013. They also have 

access to high-yielding seeds, fertiliser, 

and herbicides and rent heavy equipment, 

at below market rates. To date, we have 

disbursed more than IDR 25 billion in 

interest-free loans.

Our R&amp;D division, SMARTRI runs regular 

training programmes for smallholders. Each 

year they train several hundred farmers in 

agronomic practices focusing especially 

on integrated pest management and 

fertiliser management. Beneficial plants 

are given to the farmers at the end of the 

training session, to be planted in their field 

to contribute to the biological control of 

herbivories. In addition, SMARTRI staff also 

visit smallholder farms when requested to 

help solve pest outbreak issues or nutrient 

deficiency cases.

Partnerships with customers to help 

smallholders

GAR is also partnering with customers 

on projects aimed at helping the 

transformation of the palm oil industry.

GAR, Nestlé and Earthworm Foundation 

(formerly known as The Forest Trust) are 

collaborating on a project which seeks 

to empower small farmers and improve 

their resilience. Using interviews and 

Participatory Mapping involving dealers, 

agents, independent smallholders, their 

families and their workers, the project 

seeks to understand the smallholders’ 

farming systems, household economics, 

challenges and needs. Over 140 farmers 

took part in Land Tenure studies and 

Participatory Mapping in 2018. The 

project aims to help farmers achieve 

legality as well as ISPO certification. It also 

seeks to help them improve their product 

marketing skills and to enhance their 

natural environment and key habitat areas.  

We are also collaborating with BASF on 

Innovative Financing where BASF will 

provide the four-year stipend for farmers 

enrolled in the scheme. This collaboration 

will support two cooperatives and target 

nearly 400 hectares for replanting in Riau.

Respecting human rights in our  

supply chain 

[412-1]

As we continue to progress with our 

palm supply chain mapping and develop 

deeper support for our key suppliers, we 

have started initial steps to address salient 

labour and human rights issues within our 

supply chain. In 2018, we conducted a 

special workshop for suppliers on human 

rights together with the Indonesian 

Commission for Human Rights (Komnas 

HAM) and the International Labour 

Organisation (ILO). 



The training provided participants with 

insights into the reform of various rules 

and regulations related to employment 

and occupational health and safety, as 

well as encouraged them to adopt and 

put key human rights principles into 

practice. In addition, participants used 

this platform to share their thoughts on 

the implementation of these human rights 

principles in their own companies.

Together with Nestle and Verité, we are 

also carrying out an assessment of our 

suppliers on labour and human rights 

issues. Five mills have been chosen for the 

assessment. Amongst other things, the 

assessment aims to verify progress against 

any corrective action plan developed and 

monitored by GAR; determine risks of 

noncompliance with the GSEP, Nestlé’s 

Responsible Sourcing Standard and provide 

concrete recommendations for remediation. 

We will report results in later reports.

Providing certified sustainable palm oil 

[103-2]  [103-3]  [102-12]  [102-13]

Our Indonesian operations were early 

adopters of certification of sustainably 

produced palm oil - SMART became a 

member of the Roundtable on Sustainable 

Palm Oil (RSPO) in 2005, shortly after it 

was founded. 

Industry certification is part of GAR’s 

on-going commitment to adopt best 

practices and standards in responsible 

production, while allowing us to meet 

growing demand for certified sustainable 

palm oil. 

Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil 

(RSPO) certification

To date, over 257,600 hectares of 

plantations including over 51,000 hectares 

of smallholder estates, 29 mills, nine 

kernel crushing plants, six refineries, seven 

bulking stations and one oleo-chemicals 

plant have received RSPO certification. 

Our RSPO certification progress can be 

viewed on our website.

GAR continues to play an active role in the 

RSPO. In 2017, Mr Agus Purnomo, GAR’s 

Managing Director of Sustainability and 

Strategic Stakeholder Engagement was 

elected to the RSPO Board of Governors. 

He is also the Chair of Indonesian  

Growers Caucus (IGC) representing 

Indonesian Palm Oil Members within 

RSPO. GAR also participates in the RSPO 

working groups on peatland; biodiversity; 

human rights; and smallholders as well 

as the Principles and Criteria (P&amp;C) Task 

Force and the Dispute Settlement Facility 

Advisory Group.

International Sustainability and  

Carbon (ISCC) certification

GAR maintains ISCC certification, a 

global certification which aims to ensure 

sustainable production and use of all 

kinds of biomass in global supply chains. 

ISCC is based on the implementation of 

the highest sustainability requirements in 

ecological sustainability, social sustainability, 

compliance with laws and international 

treaties, monitoring of GHG emissions and 

good management practices. 

To date, over 288,500 hectares of 

plantations including smallholder 

plantations of over 54,200 hectares, 

30 mills, five refineries and 15 bulking 

stations have received ISCC certification. 

All biomass intended for biofuels in 

destinations like Europe are ISCC certified, 

ensuring that our products meet the 

highest responsible palm oil standards in 

the international market.

Developing a biofuel market for palm oil

We have a biodiesel plant near Jakarta 

and another in South Kalimantan. 

Biodiesel in Indonesia is a growing market 

with the government’s commitment to 

implement a larger biodiesel mixture 

mandate. Accordingly, we have received 

a larger allocation from the government 

for 2019 delivery. Likewise, we note 

the increasing biodiesel demand from 

countries such as China. We are therefore 

evaluating our long-term expansion plan 

in this industry.

Our consumers 

[102-2]

Aside from distributing palm oil to 

industrial customers, we also sell edible 

oil and food products directly to the end 

consumer in large markets like Indonesia, 

China and India.  

 

For a full list of our products and brands, 

please see our website. Please refer to

future business strategy. 

Ensuring consumer safety, wellbeing 

and product quality

[103-2]  [103-3]  [416-1]

Our consumers rely on GAR brands for 

safe and high quality products that they 

can trust. We use international standards 

to ensure the quality of our products, bar 

codes for traceability, and we systematically 

record expiry dates and batch data.

All six palm oil refineries in Indonesia are 

accredited with ISO 9001 and ISO 22000 

certification, which recognises that they 

adhere to strict international food safety 

standards. The Marunda refinery also has 

FSSC 22000 food safety certification.  

The six facilities also have OHSAS 18001, 

ISO 14001, Halal and Kosher certification. 

In addition, the refineries in Lampung 

and Belawan have FDA accreditation and 

we have GMP+B2 certification for lauric 

products at the Belawan, Lampung,  

Lubuk Gaung and Surabaya plants.  

Lubuk Gaung also has CPPOB certification 

(Good Manufacturing Practices for 

Processed Food). 

We are also committed to rolling out the 

Hazards Analysis and Critical Control Point 

or HACCP food safety system across our 

operations. 

We are aware of consumer concerns 

about the health and safety aspects of our 

end products and our Downstream R&amp;D 

department is actively addressing this area. 

In 2018, the European Food Standards 

Authority (EFSA) revised 3-MCPD and 

GE ester levels and GAR continues to 

focus on minimising occurrence of MCPD 

precursors. Our business is successfully 

tackling the 3MCPD/GE issue holistically, 

for example by minimising Free Fatty 

Acids (FFA) in CPO and optimising refining 

techniques. We are also continuing 

to optimise identification methods for 

3-MCPD and GE esters. 



We are also on track in our efforts 

to remove trans fatty acids from our 

products. We aim to be trans-fat-free in all 

margarine and shortening and specialty 

products in 2019. 

Cooking oil fortification is also another 

focus area with the Government of 

Indonesia implementing mandatory 

fortification using Vitamin A in cooking 

oil. GAR meets this requirement in all our 

products distributed in Indonesia and we 

have also taken further steps to enhance 

our impact on consumer health. Besides 

Vitamin A, our Filma Margarine is also 

fortified with vitamins B1, B2 and B3.

Sustainability Report 2018


UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT 

COP

United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) 

[102-12]

The United Nations Global Compact 

(UNGC) is a call to companies everywhere 

to align their operations and strategies 

with ten universally accepted principles 

in the areas of human rights, labour, 

environment and anti-corruption, and 

to take action in support of UN goals 

and issues embodied in the Sustainable 

Development Goals. GAR, through its 

subsidiary SMART has subscribed to the 

UNGC principles since 2006. In 2018, 

GAR became a signatory of the UNGC 

signifying our continuing commitment. 

Progressively, we take appropriate 

actions in line with the principles 

as fundamental guidelines for the 

sustainable development of our business. 

We continue to support UNGC by 

incorporating the ten principles in the way 

we do business, which helps make us a 

better corporate citizen.

As an active participant of the UNGC, this 

report also serves as our Communication 

on Progress Report (COP) to the UNGC. 

In our opinion, we meet the requirements 

for the Global Compact Active reporting 

level. Please refer to the UNGC reference 

table below for our implementation of the 

ten principles of UNGC.
