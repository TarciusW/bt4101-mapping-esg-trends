BOARD STATEMENT 

Sustainability Strategy 

Global challenges such as corruption, global warming, gender inequalities, data privacy and 

pandemics have changed the way businesses operate. We recognise that we have a role to 

play in seeking solutions to these challenges. We have to be fully accountable for our impact 

on the environment, our stakeholders and for the future generation. Therefore, we ensure 

that sustainable practices are incorporated into our business operations and we believe that 

sustainability is vital to our continuous growth and success. 

FY2021 had been a challenging year for many due to the pandemic, COVID-19, where it had 

impacted the global economy significantly and also had an adverse impact on the Group’s 

operations in Malaysia. As a result of the pandemic, the Group has ceased plans to pursue the 

expansion of the publishing operations. 

However, the Group continues to remain positive as we take this opportunity to shift towards 

digital and online publishing this year. We will continue to rationalise our publishing 

operations in Malaysia to improve sustainability of our business. Under the current 

challenging economic condition, the Group had diversified into property related businesses 

and acquired a Hong Kong based shelf company, Fame Harvest Limited, as announced on 14 

May 2021,  to serve as the holding company for the Group’s intended businesses in Hong 

Kong.   

Sustainability Governance 

Our Board oversees the management and monitors the ESG topics highlighted in the 

Sustainability Report. Together with the management, we communicate regularly with our 

stakeholders to identify their needs and ensure that our long-term sustainability goals align. 

Understanding the needs of our stakeholders allows us to identify the ESG topics which are 

material to the Group.  

Sustainability Factors 

We review the material ESG topics annually based on issues or concerns that our stakeholders 

might have. Through our process of engaging our stakeholders, we are able to address the 

risks that have an impact to our operations and set goals for the achievement towards 

progress on our sustainability efforts.  

Lastly, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude and appreciation to our stakeholders 

who have participated and contributed in our sustainability journey.  We look forward to your 

continuous support and partnership in our journey towards building a sustainable future.

The Board regularly receives updates on regulatory changes from the Company Secretary and 

latest accounting standards requirements from the independent auditors. The Executive

Supply Chain Management 

We engage our business partners in developing a sustainable supply chain for our existing

sustainability by efficiently utilising their resources and reducing waste. Although our regular 

print suppliers were not open for business during the Movement Control Orders (“MCO”) 

instituted by the Malaysian Government as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able 

to partner with other ISO 14001:2015 certified print suppliers who were available in the 

market. Hence, our business operations, in terms of supplies, were not disrupted. There were 

no significant changes to our supply chain for FY2021.

ANTI-CORRUPTION 

Why is it Material 

To protect our stakeholders’ interest and prevent reputational damage to the Group, we do 

not tolerate corruption in any form and strive to conduct our business with utmost integrity 

and transparency. 

Management Approach 

Our employees observe a strict code of conduct relating to conflict of interest and fraud. We 

stay well informed with the developments of relevant regulations and Companies Act through 

updates received from the Company Secretary on a half-yearly basis. Our Code of Conduct 

Policy is reviewed and updated regularly to safeguard the interests of our stakeholders. Other 

anti-corruption efforts include periodic updates to the Board on strategic developments and 

performance measurements by the senior management, allowing the Board to monitor and 

assess potential risks which may arise. Please refer to the “Corporate Governance Report” 

section in the FY2021 annual report for more information. 

We have a Whistle-blowing Policy which allows our employees to voice their concerns or 

complaints in relation to any perceived irregularities, improprieties, non-compliances or 

wrongdoings by management or fellow staff during the course of their work. These whistle-

blowing reports will be sent to the Company Secretary and submitted to the Audit Committee. 

Independent investigations for appropriate remedial and follow-up actions will be conducted.   

All employees, including the management team and the Board, are required to make 

declarations on any existing and potential interest in companies within the Group and the 

nature of the interest. Declarations are made during employees’ on-boarding process and on 

an ad-hoc basis. Employees are made aware of these policies during the orientation process 

and through regular communications within the Group. Any updates and developments on 

relevant regulations will be disseminated via email to the relevant personnel when 

appropriate. 

The Company currently does not have any whistleblowing policy for other stakeholders such 

as customers and suppliers and will look into establishing such policy during the financial year 

ending 31 March 2022. 

Performance 

We are pleased to announce that there were no reported incidents of corruption and no 

whistle-blowing reports received in FY2021. 

Target 

We aim to regularly review and update our policies and procedures to ensure that it complies 

with the requirements set in place by regulatory authorities. Through our strong corporate

governance and preventive measures put in place, we aim to maintain zero incidents of 

corruption.

ENERGY 

Why is it Material 

Environmental sustainability is a global key issue and the Group is fully aware of our 

responsibility to conserve the environment and reduce negative environmental impact at our 

workplace to address issues such as water scarcity and global warming. 

The generation of energy from coal powered power plants releases harmful gases in the 

atmosphere which causes pollution to the environment. These toxic gases not only have 

negative effects on the environment but also pose a health risk to humans and animals. The 

availability of fresh water is a growing challenge as the world’s population increases and 

developing economies continue to grow. With rain patterns changing due to climate change, 

the stability of water supplies is likely to become a more pressing concern every year. 

Management Approach 

We adopt the usage of energy-efficient fittings and products with Green labels in our business 

to minimise any energy wastage. We encourage our employees to switch off lights and 

electrical appliances in the office when not in use. Regular maintenance of the electrical 

appliances is conducted to optimise energy efficiency. 

We encourage our employees to cultivate water-saving habits by raising awareness on the 

importance of water conservation. Our offices use water efficient fittings that come with half-

flush mechanism and self-release water taps. 

Performance 

Due to work-from-home arrangements during the COVID-19 situation as well as through our 

energy conservation efforts such as using products with Green labels and frequent reminders 

for our employees to save electricity and water usage, we managed to decrease both 

electricity and water consumption in FY2021. Total electricity consumption decreased from 

29,468kWh in FY2020 to 27,403kWh in FY2021. Total water consumption decreased from 

164m³ in FY2020 to 136m³ in FY2021. Please refer to the figures below for details.

Target 

We strive to look for different initiatives and practices to reduce our consumption of 

electricity and water. We also target a 2% reduction in the usage of electricity and water for 

FY2022.

NON-DISCRIMINATION 

Why is it Material 

The Group recognises that a diverse workforce is an asset in today’s ever-changing global 

marketplace, and we aim to retain them by providing a work environment with fair labour 

practices and equal opportunities. Our workforce comprises people from a wide array of 

cultures and backgrounds, which helps to provide different perspectives and opinions. This 

benefits us as we will be able to understand and serve readers or customers from different 

backgrounds and age groups.  

Management Approach 

The Group has a comprehensive Human Resource Policy to guide the selection and 

assessment of employees based on merit and competency, preventing any form of 

discrimination against different age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, race, 

nationality, ethnic, or religion. The policy also guides us in providing equal opportunities to 

our employees for career advancement and growth based on their performance and 

achievements. 

We provide equal opportunities to our employees and perform annual employee assessment 

on their performance to recognise and reward employees for their hard work, dedication and 

commitment. 

Our employees work in a collaborative work environment in which everybody is committed 

to achieve our corporate goals while showing care and support for one another. We 

encourage two-way communication and any feedback can be raised by the employees to the 

Human Resource Department for further actions and discussions. 

Performance 

In FY2021, we continue to advocate gender equality and age diversity of our employees in 

Singapore and Malaysia as demonstrated in the figures below.

LOCAL COMMUNITIES 

Why is it Material 

We recognise that supporting and engaging the local communities help to build goodwill and 

enhance the Group’s reputation. We believe in being a business that looks beyond 

profitability. 

Management Approach 

The Group maintains our aim to deliver and produce contents with positive social impact. As 

a publishing company, Inovatif promotes awareness about local communities to our readers 

through the editorial content in the various publications. The contents published range from 

business, investing, health and wellness, cultures, arts to family relationship as we always 

strive to incorporate local culture and society relevance into the contents of our magazines. 

These publications provide valuable knowledge and insights on specific topics to our readers 

in the local community.  

We continuously monitor feedback from our readers to understand their needs and 

satisfaction towards our magazines. We also work with financial planners, experts and related 

associates to provide financial literacy and promote financial education and investment 

knowledge to our readers. 

 

Performance 

Due to the impact of COVID-19, Smart Investor magazine readership has been affected as 

many bookstores and newsstands have either closed down or converted its magazine shelves 

to groceries (mainly in newsstands) to maintain relevant as essential stores during the various 

MCOs instituted by the Malaysian Government. The impact of the MCOs and the closures of 

magazine sections have reduced magazine sales by about 50% in FY2021. For FY2022, we 

expect the copy sales of magazine to remain low in view of the prevailing and evolving COVID-

19 situation. The readership for Feng and Calibre remained unchanged as these magazines 

were published for the investors of the Public Mutual Fund on a complimentary basis and the 

number of copies printed were fixed.  

 




ARION ENTERTAINMENT SINGAPORE LIMITED 

 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021

Please refer to the table below for information on the estimated readership in FY2021. 

*Readership numbers are estimations made based on total circulation.   

We have also been supporting and helping out in events that promote business and financial 

literacy throughout the years. In FY2021, we continue to be the media partner for events such 

as Malaysian Industrial Relation Awards, Financial Planning Symposium, Investor Relation 

Award, FSMOne Recommended Unit Trust Awards, Federation of Investment Managers 

Malaysia Annual Convention as well as other related business events and seminars. 

We also seek to create long-term benefits for our communities through recruitment from our  

local talent network and engaging local suppliers. When organising and planning events for 

our clients, we maintain our outreach to local communities through constant lookouts for 

local talents and resources in delivering services to our clients. 

Target 

We will continue to produce and deliver contents which are relevant, beneficial and impactful 

to the society, and to increase our readership across Malaysia, by gradually shifting towards 

digital and online publishing.

CUSTOMER PRIVACY 

Why is it Material 

As technology advances, there is a growing concern on personal data collection and how the 

personal data collected is being used. We recognise that the trust from our customers that 

their personal data is being collected, handled and protected in a responsible manner is key 

to the continued success of the Group’s operations. 

Management Approach 

We are committed to complying with personal data protection regulations to safeguard and 

maintain personal data. All our employees are expected to be compliant to the Personal Data 

Protection Act (“PDPA”) of Malaysia.  

The Group strictly prohibits the use of personal information for unintended purposes and we 

have proper data destruction procedures in place for information that is not or no longer 

required. All information is kept in secure infrastructure and password protected with 

restricted access by authorised personnel of the Group. We also recognise the need for us to 

enhance system security to prevent the loss of customers’ data as well as to implement 

measures for addressing data breach incidents that might occur.  

We ensure that our employees are kept abreast of the developments in the PDPA and will 

review and update our data protection policies where required. We provide trainings to our 

employees on a periodic basis to raise their awareness and update them on any changes in 

the relevant regulations.  

Performance 

We are pleased to announce that in FY2021, there were no cases of substantiated complaints 

received regarding breaches of customer privacy and no complaints received from external 

parties and regulatory bodies. There were also no identified leaks, thefts, or losses of 

customer data.  

Target 

We will continue to handle customer personal data responsibly in a secured operating 

environment and target to maintain our record of zero incidents of customer privacy breaches.
