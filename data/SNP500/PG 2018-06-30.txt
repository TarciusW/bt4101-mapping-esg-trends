Business.Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A); and Notes 1 and 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the "Company," "P&G," "we," "our" or "us" as used herein refer to The Procter & Gamble Company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries.The Procter & Gamble Company is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world's consumers.  The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having been built from a business founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble.  Today, our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories.Throughout this Form 10-K, we incorporate by reference information from other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments thereto, are filed electronically with the SEC.  The SEC maintains an internet site that contains these reports at: www.sec.gov.  You can also access these reports through links from our website at: www.pginvestor.com.Copies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting EQ Shareowner Services, 1100 Centre Pointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota, MN 55120-4100.Financial Information about SegmentsAs of June 30, 2018, the Company has five reportable segments under U.S. GAAP:  Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care.  Many of the factors necessary for understanding these businesses are similar.  Operating margins of the individual businesses vary due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products, the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales.  Net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets and product categories in which they operate.  While none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal, components within certain reportable segments, such as Appliances (Grooming) and Personal Health Care (Health), are seasonal. Additional information about our reportable segments can be found in the MD&A and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Narrative Description of BusinessBusiness Model.  Our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products, as well as the creation of new innovative products.  The markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive.  Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e- commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. Our growth strategy is to deliver meaningful and noticeable superiority in all elements of our consumer proposition - product, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value equation. We use our research and development and consumer insights to provide superior products and packaging. We utilize our marketing and online presence to deliver superior brand messaging to our consumers. We work collaboratively with our customers to deliver superior retail execution, both in-store and online. In conjunction with the above elements, we provide superior value to consumers and our retail customers, in each price tier where we compete.Key Product Categories.  Information on key product categories can be found in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Key Customers.  Our customers include mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies.  Sales to Walmart Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 15% of our total sales in 2018, 16% in 2017 and 15% in 2016.  No other customer represents more than 10% of our total sales.  Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 36% of our total sales in 2018 and 35% in both 2017 and 2016.  The nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government.  We believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete.Sources and Availability of Materials.  Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from others, some of whom are single-source suppliers.  We produce certain raw materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process.  In addition, fuel, natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing process and in the transportation of input materials and finished products to customers.  The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation.  When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass the change to our customers.  The Company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, none of which is material to our business taken as a whole.Trademarks and Patents.  We own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks, which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses.  Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products.  The trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products.  All major trademarks in each business are registered.  In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses.2        The Procter & Gamble CompanyCompetitive Condition.  The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive.  Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known global competitors.  In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands.  We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.  We support our products with advertising, promotions and other marketing vehicles to build awareness and trial of our brands and products in conjunction with our sales force.  We believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products.  Product quality, performance, value and packaging are also important differentiating factors.Research and Development Expenditures.  Research and development (R&D) expenditures enable us to develop technologies and obtain patents across all categories in order to meet the needs and improve the lives of our consumers.  Research and development expenses were $1.9 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016 (reported in Net earnings from continuing operations).Expenditures for Environmental Compliance. Expenditures for compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are fairly consistent from year to year and are not material to the Company.  No material change is expected in fiscal year 2019.Employees.  Total number of employees is an estimate of total Company employees excluding interns, co-ops, contractors and employees of joint ventures as of the years ended June 30.  The number of employees includes manufacturing and non-manufacturing employees.  The number of employees is not restated to exclude employees of discontinued operations. Total Number of Employees201892,000201795,0002016105,0002015110,0002014118,0002013121,000Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations.  Net sales in the United States account for 41% of total net sales.  No other individual country exceeds 10% of total net sales.  Operations outside the United States are generally characterized by the same conditions discussed in the description of the business above and may be affected by additional factors including changing currency values, different rates of inflation, economic growth and political and economic uncertainties and disruptions. Our sales by geography for the fiscal years ended June 30 were as follows: 2018 2017 2016North America (1)44% 45% 44%Europe24% 23% 23%Asia Pacific9% 9% 9%Greater China9% 8% 8%Latin America7% 8% 8%IMEA (2)7% 7% 8%(1) North America includes results for the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico only.(2) IMEA includes India, Middle East and Africa.Net sales and total assets in the United States and internationally were as follows (in billions):Net Sales  (years ended June 30)United States International2018$27.3 $39.52017$27.3 $37.82016$27.0 $38.3Total Assets  (years ended June 30)2018$63.4 $54.92017$59.8 $60.62016$64.4 $62.7Item 1A.  Risk Factors.We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-K, quarterly and annual reports, press releases and other written and oral communications.  All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete.  We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors.  Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations.The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.  This information should be read in conjunction with the MD&A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes incorporated in this report.  The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations.  These and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends.The Procter & Gamble Company        3Our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility.We are a global company, with operations in approximately 70 countries and products sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world.  We hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and our operations outside the U.S. generate a significant portion of our net revenue.  Fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows we receive from non-U.S. markets, increase our supply costs (as measured in U.S. dollars) in those markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition.  Moreover, discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries, including potential changes to tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, could adversely affect our results.  See also the Results of Operations and Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity sections of the MD&A and Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of countries with currency exchange, import authorization, pricing or other controls or restrictions, such as Nigeria, Algeria and Egypt.  Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions, continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas, or if new or increased tariffs, quotas, exchange or price controls, trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business.Additionally, our business, operations or employees may be adversely affected by political volatility, labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions, including political instability or upheaval, broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments, particularly in emerging markets.Uncertain global economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship, which could adversely impact our business.Our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local, regional or global economic disruptions, such as: a slow-down in the general economy; reduced market growth rates; tighter credit markets for our suppliers, vendors or customers; a significant shift in government policies; or the inability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers.  Additionally, economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third-party partners to suffer financial difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.   Customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles. In addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient income and cash flow, it could affect the Company’s ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments.Disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit.A disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital.Disruption in our global supply chain may negatively impact our business results.Our ability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements.  The loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, discontinuity in our internal information and data systems, inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials, significant changes in trade policy, natural disasters, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change or otherwise, acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results.Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities and raw materials and the costs of labor, transportation, energy, pension and healthcare.  Therefore, our business results are dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share.  Failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our financial results.Our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation and changing consumer habits.We are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products.  Achieving our business results depends, in part, on successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes.  The success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends, to obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others.  We 4        The Procter & Gamble Companymust also successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors.  Failure to continually innovate, improve and respond to competitive moves and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our results.The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.The consumer products industry is highly competitive.  Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors.  As a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining profit margins.  To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms.  In addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online and growth in hard discounter channels.  Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile commerce applications, could negatively impact our results.A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.We sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies.  Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets.  Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles.  Our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level or shelf space of our products as a result of increased offerings of private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption.If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.The Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers.  The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business.  Many of our brands have worldwide  recognition and our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands.  The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers.  Our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients or environmental impacts, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products.  Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company.  If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted and our financial results could suffer.  Our Company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, diversity and inclusion, gender equality and environmental sustainability.  If these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, the Company's reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted.We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.Due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, for certain functions.  If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party partners operate, our financial results could suffer.  Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk.An information security or operational technology incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of one or more key information or operations technology systems, networks, hardware, processes, and/or associated sites owned or operated by the Company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation.As part of the Company’s regular review of potential risks, we maintain an information and operational technology (“IT/OT”) risk management program that is primarily supervised by information technology management and reviewed by internal cross-functional stakeholders.  As part of this program, analyses of emerging cybersecurity threats as well as the Company’s plans and strategies to address them are regularly prepared and presented to senior management, the Audit The Procter & Gamble Company        5Committee and the Board of Directors. Despite our policies, procedures and programs, including this IT/OT risk management program, we may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to which we are exposed.We rely extensively on IT/OT systems, networks and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and technologies, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, many of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business.  The various uses of these IT/OT systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to:•ordering and managing materials from suppliers;•converting materials to finished products;•shipping products to customers;•marketing and selling products to consumers;•collecting, transferring, storing and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor, and other stakeholder information and personal data, including such data from citizens of the European Union who are covered by the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”); •summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting;•managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms;•hosting, processing and sharing, as appropriate, confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information;•collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications;•complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements;•providing data security; and•handling other processes necessary to manage our business.Numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our services, systems, networks and supply chain, as well as to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations.  As cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent across the industry globally, the Company is continually increasing its attention to these threats.  We assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments seeking to address them, including ongoing monitoring and updating of networks and systems, increasing specialized information security skills, deploying employee security training, and updating security policies for the Company and its third-party providers.  However, because the techniques, tools and tactics used in cyber attacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack. Our IT/OT databases and systems and our third-party providers’ databases and systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to advanced computer viruses or other  malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking and other cyber-attacks.   Such attacks may originate from nation states or attempts by outside parties, hackers, criminal organizations or other threat actors.  To date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks; however, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third-party providers will prevent material breaches, operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our third-party providers’ IT/OT databases or systems.Periodically, we also need to upgrade our IT/OT systems or adopt new technologies.  If such a new system or technology does not function properly or otherwise exposes us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures, it could affect our ability to order materials, make and ship orders, and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues.  Further, if the IT/OT systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations, or inadvertent disclosure of, lack of integrity of, or loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling, security incidents or employee error or malfeasance, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action.  The costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results.Changing political conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results.Changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union has created uncertainty regarding, among other things, the U.K.'s future legal and economic framework and how the U.K. will interact with other countries, including with respect to the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. In addition, results of elections, referendums or other political processes in certain markets in which our products are manufactured, sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies, laws and regulations may change, including with respect to sanctions, taxes, the movement of goods, services, capital and people between countries and other matters.  The potential implications of such uncertainty, which include, among others, exchange rate fluctuations, trade barriers and market contraction, could adversely affect the Company’s business and financial results.We must successfully manage compliance with laws and regulations, as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the U.S. and abroad.Our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across all of the countries in which we do business, including 6        The Procter & Gamble Companythose laws and regulations involving intellectual property, product liability, marketing, antitrust, data protection, environmental (including climate, water, waste), employment, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, tax, accounting and financial reporting or other matters.  Rapidly changing laws, regulations and related interpretations, as well as increased enforcement actions, create challenges for the Company, including our compliance and ethics programs, and may alter the environment in which we do business, which could adversely impact our financial results.  If we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results.  Failure to successfully manage regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.  Furthermore, if pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position.Changes in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results.The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.  Changes in the various tax laws can and do occur. For example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “U.S. Tax Act”). The changes included in the U.S. Tax Act are broad and complex.  The final transition impacts of the U.S. Tax Act may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in this report, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the U.S. Tax Act, any regulatory guidance or  legislative action to address questions that arise because of the U.S. Tax Act or any updates or changes to estimates the Company has utilized to calculate the transition impacts, including impacts from changes to current year earnings estimates.  Additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving as a result of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting reporting requirements (“BEPS") recommended by the G8, G20 and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD").  As these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our financial results could be materially impacted.  Given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results.Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities.  While we believe our tax positions will be sustained, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, including maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions such as the fiscal 2017 Beauty Brands transaction with Coty, may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial  Statements, which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial results.We must successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities.As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities.  We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. Specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands or dissolution of joint ventures such as the termination of the PGT Healthcare partnership between the Company and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Our financial results could also be impacted by acquisitions or joint venture activities, such as the planned acquisition of Merck KGaA's Consumer Health business, if:  1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 2) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures, including as a result of integration and collaboration challenges, which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets.Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change.Our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings, including staffing adjustments as well as employee departures.  Failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings, while continuing to invest in business growth, could adversely impact our financial results. Additionally, successfully executing organizational change, including management transitions at leadership levels of the Company and motivation and retention of key employees, is critical to our business success.  Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers and availability of qualified personnel. Our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business.  This includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense, as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans.Item 1B.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Management's Discussion and AnalysisForward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including without limitation, the following sections: “Management's Discussion and Analysis” and “Risk Factors.”  These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions.  Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.  A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein is included, without limitation, in the section titled "Economic Conditions and Uncertainties" and the section titled “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).  We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise.The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year.  The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.  The MD&A is organized in the following sections:•Overview•Summary of 2018 Results •Economic Conditions and Uncertainties•Results of Operations•Segment Results•Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity•Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates•Other InformationThroughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings.  We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity.  Organic sales growth is net sales  growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, foreign exchange and India Goods and Services tax changes from year-over-year comparisons.  Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends.  Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending and certain divestiture impacts.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding certain one-time items.  We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management.  The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures.Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information.  References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal-year-to-date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months.OVERVIEWP&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world.  Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies.  We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors.  In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products, as well as retailers' private-label brands.  Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products).  We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.The Procter & Gamble Company        13ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTUREOur organizational structure is comprised of Global Business Units (GBUs), Selling and Market Operations (SMOs), Global Business Services (GBS) and Corporate Functions (CF).Global Business UnitsOur GBUs are organized into ten product categories.  Under U.S. GAAP, the GBUs underlying the ten product categories are aggregated into five reportable segments:  Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric & Home Care; and Baby, Feminine & Family Care.  The GBUs are responsible for developing overall brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovations and marketing plans.  The following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the ten product categories and brand composition within each segment.Reportable Segments% ofNet Sales (1)% of NetEarnings (1)Product Categories (Sub-Categories)Major BrandsBeauty19%23%Hair Care (Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments)Head & Shoulders,  Pantene, RejoiceSkin and Personal Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care)Olay, Old Spice,  Safeguard, SK-IIGrooming10%14%Grooming (2) (Shave Care - Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care; Appliances)Braun, Fusion, Gillette, Mach3, Prestobarba, VenusHealth Care12%13%Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care)Crest, Oral-BPersonal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care)Metamucil, Prilosec, VicksFabric & Home Care32%27%Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents)Ariel, Downy, Gain, TideHome Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care)Cascade, Dawn, Febreze, Mr. Clean, SwifferBaby, Feminine & Family Care27%23%Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants)Luvs, PampersFeminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care)Always, TampaxFamily Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper)Bounty, Charmin, Puffs(1) Percent of Net sales and Net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2018 (excluding results held in Corporate).(2) The Grooming product category is comprised of the Shave Care and Appliances GBUs.   Recent Developments: During fiscal 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire the over the counter (OTC) healthcare business of Merck KGaA for €3.375 billion ($3.9 billion based on current exchange rates).  This business primarily sells OTC consumer healthcare products, mainly in Europe, Latin America and Asia markets.  Total sales for the business during its most recent fiscal year were approximately $1 billion.   We anticipate the transaction to close during fiscal 2019, with the timing subject to regulatory clearance and customary closing conditions.   The Company also reached an agreement during fiscal 2018 to dissolve our PGT Healthcare partnership, a venture between the Company and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd (Teva) in the OTC consumer healthcare business.  Pursuant to the agreement, PGT product assets will return to the original respective parent companies to reestablish independent OTC businesses.  This transaction was completed in July 2018 and will be accounted for as a sale of the Teva portion of the PGT business.  The Company expects to record an after-tax gain on the sale of approximately $285 million. During fiscal 2017, the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories, which included 43 of the Company's beauty brands ("Beauty Brands"), including the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and the fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands.  The Beauty Brands had historically been part of the Company’s Beauty reportable segment.  The results of the Beauty Brands are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. During fiscal 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of its Batteries business.  The Batteries business had historically been part of the Company’s Fabric & Home Care reportable segment.  The results of the Batteries business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. As a result of these divestitures, the Company's portfolio is comprised of 10 category-based businesses where P&G has 14        The Procter & Gamble Companyleading market positions, strong brands and consumer meaningful product technologies.Refer to Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on each of these divestiture transactions.Beauty:  We are a global market leader in the beauty category.

Excluding the impact of minor brand divestitures, organic volume increased mid-single digits in Fabric & Home Care.•Net earnings from continuing operations decreased $333 million or 3% in fiscal 2018, due primarily to the transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Act). Please refer to Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on tax impacts. Operating income decreased 2% due to reduced margins, partially offset by net sales growth. This was largely offset by an increase in Other non-operating income/(expense), net, due to higher costs of early extinguishment of debt in the base period. Favorable foreign exchange impacts increased net earnings from continuing operations by approximately $125 million or 1%.•Net earnings from discontinued operations were zero in fiscal 2018 compared to $5.2 billion in fiscal 2017  primarily due to the net impact of a gain on the sale of our Beauty Brands business. •Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $9.8 billion, a decrease of $5.6 billion or 36% versus the prior year primarily due to the aforementioned reduction in net earnings from discontinued operations.•Diluted net earnings per share decreased 34% to $3.67.◦Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 1% to $3.67.◦Core EPS increased 8% to $4.22.•Cash flow from operating activities was $14.9 billion.◦Adjusted free cash flow was $11.2 billion.◦Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 104%.16        The Procter & Gamble CompanyECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIESWe discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications.  All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are "forward-looking statements" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete.  We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors.  Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations.  For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.Global Economic Conditions. Current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest in the Middle East, Central & Eastern Europe and the Korean peninsula, economic uncertainty related to the execution of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, political instability in certain Latin American markets and overall economic slowdowns, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings.Changes in Costs.  Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs and our own productivity efforts.  We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs.  If we are unable to manage commodity and other cost fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings.  Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products.  We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization.  As discussed later in this MD&A, we initiated certain non-manufacturing overhead reduction projects along with manufacturing and other supply chain cost improvement projects in 2012.  In fiscal 2017, we communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year cost reduction program which is resulting in enrollment reductions and other savings.  If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings.Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates.  Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.  Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a  currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  Over previous fiscal years, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts.  Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Egypt, Russia, Turkey and the United Kingdom have previously had, and could in the future have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings.  Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales and profits. Government Policies.  Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies, for example, the U.S. Tax Act enacted in December 2017, the implications and uncertainties of which are disclosed elsewhere in this report.  Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria and Egypt.  Further, our earnings and sales could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, including potential increases of import tariffs.  Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings.For information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (SG&A), other non-operating items and income taxes.  The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives and other activities by competitors), marketing spending and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as pricing actions (which can also indirectly impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the U.S.Most of our cost of products sold and SG&A are to some extent variable in nature.  Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs.  The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the The Procter & Gamble Company        17underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for example, product or package improvements) and to a lesser extent scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature).  The primary components of SG&A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs.  Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies.  Overhead costs are also variable in nature, but on a relative basis, less so than marketing costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth.  Accordingly, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs.The Company is in the midst of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses.  The plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy.Net SalesFiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 Net sales increased 3% to $66.8 billion in 2018 on a 1% increase in unit volume versus the prior year.  Volume increased low single digits in Beauty, Health Care and Fabric & Home Care and was unchanged in Grooming. Volume decreased low single  digits in Baby, Feminine and Family Care. Excluding the impact of minor brand divestitures, Fabric & Home Care organic volume increased mid-single digits. Volume increased low single digits in developed and developing regions. Favorable foreign exchange increased net sales by 2%. Pricing had a negative 1% impact on net sales. Product mix had a positive 1% impact on net sales primarily due to a disproportionate growth in super-premium brands.  Organic sales grew 1% driven by a 2% increase in organic volume.Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Net sales were unchanged at $65.1 billion in 2017 on a 1% increase in unit volume versus the prior year period.  Volume increased low single digits in Grooming, Health Care, Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care.  Volume decreased low single digits in Beauty.  Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and was unchanged in developing regions.  Organic volume increased low single digits in both developed and developing markets.  Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%.  Neither pricing nor mix had any net impact on net sales for the year.  Organic sales grew 2% driven by a 2% increase in organic volume.Operating CostsComparisons as a percentage of net sales; Years ended June 302018 Basis Point Change 2017 Basis Point Change 2016Gross margin48.7% (130) 50.0% 40 49.6%Selling, general and administrative expense28.2% (30) 28.5% (50) 29.0%Operating margin20.5% (100) 21.5% 90 20.6%Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes19.9% (50) 20.4% (10) 20.5%Net earnings from continuing operations14.8% (90) 15.7% 30 15.4%Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble14.6% (900) 23.6% 750 16.1%Fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017Gross margin decreased 130 basis points to 48.7% of net sales in 2018.  Gross margin benefited 200 basis points from total manufacturing cost savings (170 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments). This was more than offset by:•a 90 basis-point negative impact due to higher commodity costs,•a 50 basis-point decline due to reduced pricing,•a 100 basis-point decline from unfavorable product mix (within segments due to the disproportionate growth of lower margin product forms, large sizes and club channels and between segments caused by the disproportionate volume growth in Fabric & Home Care, which has lower than company-average gross margins),•a 30 basis-point negative impact from higher restructuring charges and•a 30 basis-point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange. Total SG&A increased 2% to $18.9 billion driven by increased overhead and marketing spending, as well as an increase in other net operating expenses, primarily due to higher gains on real estate sales in the base period.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 28.2%. Reductions in marketing and overhead spending as a percentage of net sales were partially offset by an increase in other net operating expenses.•Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points, primarily driven by reductions in agency compensation and production costs.•Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points, primarily driven by productivity savings and sales growth leverage, partially offset by higher restructuring costs versus the base year.•Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points primarily due to gains on the sale of real estate in the base year.18        The Procter & Gamble CompanyFiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Gross margin increased 40 basis points (bps) to 50.0% of net sales in 2017.  Gross margin increased primarily due to:•a 230 basis-point positive impact from total manufacturing cost savings (210 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments),•a 20 basis-point benefit from lower restructuring charges and•a 10 basis-point benefit from positive scale impacts due to higher volume.These impacts were partially offset by:•a 90 basis-point decrease from unfavorable product mix between segments (caused primarily by the lower relative proportion of sales in Grooming, which has higher than company-average gross margins) and within segments (due to disproportionate growth of lower margin products, forms and package sizes in certain businesses),•a 40 basis-point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange and•a combined 70 basis-point impact due to higher commodities and other costs.Total SG&A decreased 2% to $18.6 billion as increased overhead and advertising spending were more than offset by a reduction in other operating expenses, primarily due to a reduction in net foreign exchange transactional costs and gains on real estate sales.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points to 28.5% as a result of the decline in other operating expenses.•Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points due to an increase in marketing activities, partially offset by productivity savings.•Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points, primarily driven by wage inflation and increased sales personnel in certain businesses, partially offset by 20 basis points of productivity savings.•Other operating expenses as a percent of net sales declined 80 basis points.  Lower foreign exchange transactional charges reduced SG&A as a percentage of net sales by approximately 20 basis points.  The balance of the reduction is primarily driven by gains on sales of real estate.Non-Operating ItemsFiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017•Interest expense was $506 million in 2018, an increase of $41 million versus the prior year due to an increase in average long term debt balances and an increase in U.S. interest rates.•Interest income was $247 million in 2018, an increase of $76 million versus the prior year primarily due to an increase in average balances of interest bearing cash and cash equivalents and investment securities balances and an increase in U.S. interest rates.•Other non-operating income/(expense), which consists primarily of divestiture gains, investment income and other non-operating items was a net expense of $126 million in 2018, an improvement of $278 million versus  the prior year primarily due to lower charges for the early extinguishment of debt (which totaled $346 million in the current year and $543 million in the base year) and an increase in minor brand divestiture gains. In the current year we had approximately $190 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Swisse, Bold and other minor brands. In 2017, we had approximately $110 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Hipoglos and other minor brands. Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016•Interest expense was $465 million in 2017, a decrease of $114 million versus the prior year due to a decrease in weighted average interest rates.•Interest income was $171 million in 2017, comparable to 2016.•Other non-operating income/(expense), which consists primarily of divestiture gains, investment income and  other non-operating items, was a net expense of $404 million in 2017 versus a net income of $325 million in 2016, a $729 million year-over-year decrease.  This change is due to a $543 million current-year charge related to early extinguishment of long-term debt and a reduction in gains on minor brand divestitures.  In 2017, we had approximately $110 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Hipoglos (a baby care brand sold primarily in Brazil) and other minor brands.  The prior year divestiture activities included approximately $300 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Escudo and certain hair care brands in Europe and IMEA.Income TaxesFiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 290 basis points to 26.0% in 2018. A net transitional charge of $602 million resulting from the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act caused a 450 basis-point increase in the current period rate (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). The remaining net decrease of 160 basis points in the effective rate was driven by:•a 280 basis-point year over year reduction from the ongoing impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, as the impact of the lower blended U.S. federal rate on current year earnings versus prior year rate was partially offset by reduced foreign tax credits versus prior year due to the inability to fully credit foreign taxes under the U.S. Tax Act,•a 170 basis-point reduction from favorable geographic mix of earnings, primarily due to a greater proportion of income in lower tax foreign jurisdictions, •a 180 basis-point increase from reduced favorable discrete impacts related to uncertain income tax positions (which netted to approximately 25 basis points in the current year versus 205 basis points in the prior year),•a 70 basis-point increase from reduced excess tax benefits from share-based compensation (60 basis points in the current year versus 130 basis points in the prior year) and•a 40 basis-point unfavorable impact due to reduced benefits from the tax impacts of early extinguishment of long-term debt (10 basis-point benefit in current year versus 50 basis-point benefit in the prior year).The Procter & Gamble Company        19Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 190 basis points to 23.1%.  The rate declined due to:•a 130 basis-point impact from excess tax benefits associated with share-based payments due to the adoption of FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting in 2017,•a 150 basis-point benefit  from discrete impacts related to uncertain income tax positions (which netted to approximately 205 basis points in the current year versus 55 basis points in the prior year),•a 50 basis-point benefit from the tax impact of the early extinguishment of long-term debt and•a 130 basis-point benefit from the prior year establishment of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards.These benefits were partially offset by a 230 basis-point increase from unfavorable geographic mix, primarily due to a greater proportion of total income taxed in the U.S. and a 40 basis-point increase due to the impact of minor brand divestitures.Net EarningsFiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 Net earnings from continuing operations decreased 3% to $9.9 billion.  Operating income decreased $244 million, or 2%, as the increase in net sales and decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales were more than offset by the reduction in gross margin. The increase in net non-operating income/(expense) discussed above benefited net earnings. Net earnings from continuing operations before taxes increased 1%. Increased income tax expense negatively impacted net earnings from continuing operations by approximately 4% due largely to the net charge for the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act in 2018. Foreign exchange had a positive impact of $125 million on net earnings in 2018 due to strengthening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar, including those in the United Kingdom, China, Canada and Russia. This impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.Net earnings from discontinued operations were zero in 2018. Net earnings from discontinued operations were $5.2 billion in 2017, primarily due to the gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands which closed on October 1, 2016 (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $5.6 billion, or 36%, to $9.8 billion. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in net earnings from discontinued operations.Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations declined $0.02, or 1%, to $3.67 due primarily to the reduction in net earnings from continuing operations, partially offset by a reduction in the number of weighted average shares outstanding.Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations were zero in 2018, and were $1.90 per share in the prior year due to the gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands in 2017.  Diluted net earnings per share decreased $1.92, or 34%, to $3.67. Core EPS increased 8% to $4.22.  Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the current year net charge for the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act and the charges in both periods for early extinguishment of debt and incremental restructuring charges related to our productivity and cost savings plans. The increase was driven by increased sales, the lower effective tax rate on core earnings (excluding the transitional net tax charge from the U.S. Tax Act) and the reduction in the number of weighted average shares outstanding discussed above.Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Net earnings from continuing operations increased $167 million, or 2%, to $10.2 billion.  Operating income improved $514 million, or 4%, due to improved gross margin and reduced SG&A costs.  Net earnings also benefitted from a lower tax rate in 2017.  These benefits were partially offset by the increase in net non-operating expenses, discussed above.  Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $420 million in 2017 due to weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar, including those in Argentina, Nigeria, Egypt and the United Kingdom.  This impact includes both transactional charges as discussed above in Operating Costs and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.Net earnings from discontinued operations increased $4.6 billion in 2017 to $5.2 billion.  This change was driven by the $5.3 billion gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands in the current year, partially offset by the impact of the base period results, which included the net earnings of the Batteries and Beauty Brands businesses prior to divestiture, a gain on the sale of the Batteries business and impairment charges on the Batteries business prior to divestiture (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $4.8 billion, or 46%, to $15.3 billion.Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.20, or 6%, to $3.69 due to the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and a reduction in the number of weighted average shares outstanding following the shares tendered in the sale of the Beauty Brands to Coty (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), along with ongoing share repurchases.Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations were $1.90.  This was an increase of $1.70 per share versus the prior year primarily resulting from the gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands.  Diluted net earnings per share increased $1.90, or 51%, to $5.59.Core EPS increased 7% to $3.92.  Core EPS in fiscal year 2017 represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the charge related to early extinguishment of long-term debt and incremental restructuring charges related to our productivity and cost savings plan.  The increase was driven by operating margin expansion, lower effective tax rate and the reduction in the number of weighted average shares outstanding discussed above.20        The Procter & Gamble CompanySEGMENT RESULTSSegment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation.  The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs such as interest expense, investing activities and certain restructuring and asset impairment costs.

These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; certain employee benefit costs; other general corporate items; gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization.  Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP.  The most significant reconciling item is income taxes, to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. For 2018, the tax impact also includes the impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, which were included in the corporate segment.Fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017Corporate net sales decreased 2% to $497 million in 2018 due to a decrease in the incidental businesses managed at the  corporate level.  Corporate net earnings/(loss) from continuing operations decreased by $380 million in 2018, primarily due to:•an increase in income tax expense in 2018 caused by the aforementioned $602 million net charge for the transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act and•an increase in after-tax restructuring charges of approximately $331 million.These costs were partially offset by lower charges related to the early extinguishment of long-term debt in 2018 versus 2017, the lower tax rate on current year earnings as a result of the U.S. Tax Act and an increase in the proportion of corporate overhead spending allocated to the segments.Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016Corporate net sales increased 20%, or $83 million, to $505 million in 2017 primarily due to an increase in the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings from continuing operations improved by approximately $421 million in 2017, primarily due to:•lower restructuring charges in 2017 compared to the prior year,•a gain on the sale of real estate in the current fiscal year, •lower foreign exchange transactional charges,•a reduction in the proportion of corporate overhead spending not allocated to the segments, consisting in part of reduced stranded overheads following divestitures, and•current year tax benefits resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard on the tax impacts of share-based payments to employees (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).These benefits were partially offset by a $345 million after-tax charge on the early extinguishment of long-term debt in fiscal 2017 and lower gains from minor brand divestitures compared to 2016.Restructuring Program to deliver Productivity and Cost SavingsIn 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads.  The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. In 2017, the Company communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings program.The current productivity and cost savings plan will further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses.  As part of this plan, the Company incurred approximately $1.1 billion in total before- tax restructuring costs in fiscal 2018, with an additional amount of approximately $0.8 billion expected in fiscal 2019.  This program is expected to result in additional enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Savings generated from restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of The Procter & Gamble Company        25reinvestment. However, we estimate that through 2018, the underlying restructuring costs and other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions since 2012 have delivered approximately $3.3 billion in annual before-tax gross savings.Restructuring accruals of $513 million as of June 30, 2018 are classified as current liabilities.  Approximately 65% of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2018 either have been or will be settled with cash.  Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins.Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program and to the Operating Costs section of the MD&A for more information about the total benefit to operating margins from our total savings efforts.CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates.Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures.  Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies.  As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities.  The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Operating Cash FlowFiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 Operating cash flow was $14.9 billion in 2018, a 17% increase from the prior year.  Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, loss on extinguishment of debt, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets) generated $11.4 billion of operating cash flow.  Working capital and other impacts generated $3.5 billion of operating cash flow as summarized below.•An increase in accounts receivable used $177 million of cash due to increased sales and the timing of the year-end (which fell on a weekend, resulting in fewer days collection).  The number of days sales outstanding remained flat versus prior year.•Higher inventory used $188 million of cash mainly due to inventory increases to support initiatives and business growth across all segments. Inventory days on hand decreased approximately 1 day primarily due to foreign exchange impacts.   •Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $1.4 billion of cash.  This was primarily driven by extended payment terms with our suppliers and an increase in fourth quarter marketing activity versus the prior year.   These factors, along with offsetting impacts of foreign exchange, drove a 2 day increase in days payable outstanding.  Although difficult to project due to market and other dynamics, we anticipate incremental cash flow benefits from the extended payment terms with suppliers could decline slightly over the next fiscal year.•Other operating assets and liabilities generated $2.0 billion of cash, primarily driven by the long-term portion of the payable related to the U.S. Tax Act repatriation charge.Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Operating cash flow was $12.8 billion in 2017, a 17% decrease from the prior year.  Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes, loss/(gain) on sale of assets and impairment charges) and the loss on early extinguishment of debt generated $13.0 billion of operating cash flow.  Working capital and other impacts used $281 million of operating cash flow.•An increase in accounts receivable used $322 million of cash due to higher relative sales late in the period as compared to the prior period, partially offset by collection of approximately $150 million of retained receivables from the Beauty Brands business.  In addition, the number of days sales outstanding increased 1 day due in part to foreign exchange impacts.  •Lower inventory generated $71 million of cash mainly due to supply chain optimizations, partially offset by increases to support business growth and increased commodity costs. Inventory days on hand decreased approximately 1 day primarily due to supply chain optimizations.  •Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities decreased, using $149 million in operating cash flow.  This was caused by reduced accruals from lower fourth quarter marketing and overhead activities as compared to the base period, as well as the payment of approximately $595 million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to the divestiture of the Beauty Brands business, including liabilities retained by the Company pursuant to the terms of the agreement.  These impacts were partially offset by approximately $700 million related to extended payment terms with our suppliers.  These factors, along with the impact of foreign exchange, drove a 4 day increase in days payable outstanding.  •Other operating assets and liabilities used $43 million of cash.Adjusted Free Cash Flow.  We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment.  It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding tax payments related to certain divestitures and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation.  26        The Procter & Gamble CompanyFiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 Adjusted free cash flow was $11.2 billion in 2018, an increase of 14% versus the prior year.  The increase was primarily driven by the increase in operating cash flows as discussed above.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings, excluding the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act and the loss on early extinguishment of debt, was 104% in 2018. Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Adjusted free cash flow was $9.8 billion in 2017, a decrease of 19% versus the prior year.  The decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in operating cash flows.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings, excluding the loss on debt extinguishment and impacts of the sale of the Beauty Brands, was 94% in 2017. Investing Cash FlowFiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 Net investing activities consumed $3.5 billion in cash in 2018 mainly due to capital spending and purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales and sales and maturities of short-term investments. Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Net investing activities consumed $5.7 billion in cash in 2017 mainly due to capital spending and purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales, transactions related to the close of the Beauty Brands divestiture and sales and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Spending.  Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies, were $3.7 billion in 2018 and $3.4 billion in 2017.  Capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points to 5.6% in 2018.  Capital spending as a percentage of net sales was 5.2% in 2017.Acquisitions.  Acquisition activity used cash of $109 million in 2018, primarily related to acquisitions in the Beauty segment.  Acquisition activity was not material in 2017. Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales.  Proceeds from asset sales in 2018 contributed $269 million in cash, primarily from minor brand divestitures.  Proceeds from asset sales contributed $571 million in cash in 2017 primarily from real estate sales and other minor brand divestitures.  In fiscal 2017, the Company invested an additional $874 million of cash, received from the issuance of debt, in restricted cash.  At the closing of the Beauty Brands transaction, $1.9 billion of restricted cash (including the $874 million invested in 2017) was released and returned to cash and cash equivalents and $475 million of cash was transferred to the discontinued Beauty Brands business.Financing Cash FlowDividend Payments.  Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments.  Dividends per common share increased 3.3% to $2.79 per share in 2018.  Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $7.3 billion in 2018 and $7.2 billion in 2017.  In April 2018, the Board of Directors  declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.6896 to $0.7172 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock.  This represents a 4% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 62nd consecutive year that our dividend has increased.  We have paid a dividend for 128 years, every year since our incorporation in 1890.Long-Term and Short-Term Debt.  We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital.  Total debt was $31.3 billion as of June 30, 2018 and $31.6 billion as of June 30, 2017.Treasury Purchases.  Total share repurchases were $7.0 billion in 2018 and $5.2 billion in 2017. LiquidityAt June 30, 2018, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $4.9 billion, largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program.  We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations.  The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs.  As of June 30, 2018, $11.4 billion of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was held off-shore by foreign subsidiaries.  This balance has declined versus the prior year primarily due to cash repatriations following the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act. Under current law, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future.  Of the June 30, 2018 balance of off-shore cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the majority relates to various Western European countries. As of June 30, 2018, we did not have material cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds.We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases.  We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled, and should continue to enable, us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets.  In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements.On June 30, 2018, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard & Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard & Poor's), all with a stable outlook.We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program.  The current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2 billion five-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in November 2022 and November 2018, respectively.  Both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms The Procter & Gamble Company        27of the credit agreement.  These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn.  These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing.  In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities.  For additional details on debt see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.Contractual CommitmentsThe following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2018.Amounts in millionsTotal Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 YearsRECORDED LIABILITIES         Total debt$31,217 $10,407 $4,630 $5,224 $10,956Capital leases107 22 35 23 27U.S. Tax Act transitional charge (1)2,884 231 462 462 1,730Uncertain tax positions (2)— — — — —OTHER         Interest payments relating to long-term debt4,944 574 1,033 811 2,526Operating leases (3)1,338 275 442 325 296Minimum pension funding (4)402 131 271 — —Purchase obligations (5)1,129 778 167 47 137TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS$42,021 $12,418 $7,039 $6,891 $15,673(1) Represents the U.S. federal tax liability associated with the repatriation provisions of the U.S. Tax Act.  Does not include any provisions made for foreign withholding taxes on expected repatriations as the timing of those payments is uncertain.(2) As of June 30, 2018, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $584 million, including $114     million of interest and penalties.  Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of June 30, 2018, cannot be made.(3) Operating lease obligations are shown net of guaranteed sublease income.(4) Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements.  These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements.  Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements.  The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2020 are not currently determinable.(5) Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business.  Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent minimum commitments under take-or-pay agreements with suppliers and are in line with expected usage.  This includes service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced.  Such amounts also include arrangements with suppliers that qualify as embedded operating leases.  While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment.  The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements.  Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends.  We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application.  These include revenue recognition, income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets.  We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed  as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.Revenue RecognitionSales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned.  For us, this generally means revenue is recognized when title to the product, ownership and risk of loss transfer to the customer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer.  Trade promotions, 28        The Procter & Gamble Companyconsisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional activities, and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers.  Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred, generally at the time of the sale.  Amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation, based on contractual terms, customer performance, sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption rates.  The actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates.  These differences, which have historically not been significant, are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period.  The Company will adopt ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” on July 1, 2018.  Adoption of this standard will result in a change in the timing of recognition of certain trade promotional spending.   See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes.  Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions.Realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes.  Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments.  In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority.  These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.A core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities.  However, because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts, we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various cross-border transactions.  We have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty.  We estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70% of our global earnings. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes.  We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly.  We have  a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions.  Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.  For additional details on the Company's income taxes, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Employee BenefitsWe sponsor various post-employment benefits throughout the world.  These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees.  For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates.  These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans.  Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations.  As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred.  If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year.  The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPEB plan are partially funded.  The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  For 2018, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPEB assets was 6.8% and 8.3%, respectively.  A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPEB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $115 million.Since pension and OPEB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses.  Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan.  For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better.  The average discount rate on the defined The Procter & Gamble Company        29benefit pension plans of 2.5% represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist.  A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $190 million.  The average discount rate on the OPEB plan of 4.2% reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the U.S., which is where a majority of the plan participants receive benefits.  A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax OPEB expense by approximately $65 million.  For additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsSignificant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units and intangible assets.  The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations. We typically estimate the fair value of these assets using the income method, which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective assets.  The valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin progression, Company business plans and the discount rate applied to cash flows.Indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized, but are tested separately at least annually for impairment.  Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans.  We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.  Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.  For example, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values.  In addition, changes to, or a failure to achieve business plans or deterioration of macroeconomic conditions could result in reduced cash flows or higher discount rates, leading to a lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses.We test individual indefinite lived intangible assets by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value.  Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets.  The test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two step process.  In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.  If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a second step to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill.  The second step of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting unit's tangible and  intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination.  If the resulting implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment.Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment.  Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands.  Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, all customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives.  Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high. Both of these wholly-acquired reporting units have fair value cushions (the fair values currently exceed the underlying carrying values).  However, the overall Shave Care cushion, as well as the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset cushion, have both been reduced to below 10%, both due in large part to an increased competitive market environment, a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits and significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar that have occurred in recent years,  and which has contributed to reduced cash flow projections.  As a result, this reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset are more susceptible to impairment risk.The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the residual net sales and earnings growth rates and discount rate.  The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the 10-year time horizon.  The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans, and approximates expected long term category market growth rates.  The residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share.  As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment.  The discount rate, which is 30        The Procter & Gamble Companyconsistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure.  Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar and changes in expected rates of inflation.  While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events, significant changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of the business unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles.  As of June 30, 2018, the carrying values of Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are $19.5 billion and $15.7 billion, respectively.The table below provides a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite lived intangible asset, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the residual net sales growth rate and the discount rate, to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values.  The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 50 basis point decrease to our residual net sales growth rate or a 50 basis point increase to our discount rate. Given the size of the fair value cushions, changes in the assumptions of this magnitude would result in an impairment of the underlying goodwill and could result in an impairment of the indefinite lived intangible asset.  Approximate Percent Change in Estimated Fair Value +50 bps Discount Rate -50 bpsResidual GrowthShave Care goodwill reporting unit(10)% (7)%Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset(10)% (7)%See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing results.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of June 30, 2018.OTHER INFORMATIONHedging and Derivative Financial InstrumentsAs a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices.  We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting.  Except within financing operations, we leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize  operational hedging activities over financial market instruments.  To the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices.  See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments.Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling.  The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the RiskManager™ value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level.  The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed.  Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics™ dataset as of June 30, 2018.  In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics™, a reasonable proxy is included.Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period.  In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term.Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments.  Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations.  Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations.  These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments.Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2018, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements.Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments.  Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates.  Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity.  To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps with maturities of less than 18 months.  In addition, we have entered into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions.Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2018, we The Procter & Gamble Company        31believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements.Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments.  We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors.  We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures.As of and during the years ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, we did not have any commodity hedging activity.Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAPIn accordance with the SEC's Regulation G, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures.  We believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends (i.e. trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results.  The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes.  These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management.  These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.  These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results.  These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted.  These measures include:Organic Sales Growth.  Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of the India Goods & Services Tax changes, the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation, acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons.  We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis, and this measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth:Year ended                             June 30, 2018Net Sales GrowthForeign Exchange ImpactAcquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other (1)Organic Sales GrowthBeauty9 %(2)%—%7 %Grooming(1)%(3)%1%(3)%Health Care5 %(3)%—%2 %Fabric & Home Care3 %(1)%1%3 %Baby, Feminine & Family Care(1)%(1)%—%(2)%TOTAL COMPANY3 %(2)%—%1 %     Year ended                                          June 30, 2017Net Sales GrowthForeign Exchange ImpactAcquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other (2)Organic Sales GrowthBeauty— %2 %1%3 %Grooming(3)%2 %1%— %Health Care2 %2 %1%5 %Fabric & Home Care— %2 %1%3 %Baby, Feminine & Family Care(1)%2 %—%1 %TOTAL COMPANY— %2 %—%2 %(1) Acquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other includes the volume and mix impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the impact of the India Goods and Services Tax implementation and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales.(2) Acquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other includes the volume and mix impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales.Adjusted Free Cash Flow.  Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding certain divestiture impacts (tax payments related to certain divestitures).  Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion.  We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment.The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow ($ millions): OperatingCash FlowCapitalSpendingDivestiture impacts (1)Adjusted FreeCash Flow2018$14,867$(3,717)$—$11,150201712,753(3,384)4189,787201615,435(3,314)—12,121(1) Divestiture impacts relate to tax payments for the Beauty Brands divestiture in fiscal 2017.32        The Procter & Gamble CompanyAdjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act,  the losses on early debt extinguishment, the gain on the sale of the Batteries and Beauty Brands businesses and  Batteries impairments.  We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes.  This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.  The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity ($ millions): NetEarningsAdjustments to Net Earnings (1)Net Earnings Excluding AdjustmentsAdjusted Free Cash FlowAdjusted FreeCash FlowProductivity2018$9,861$845$10,706$11,150104%201715,411(4,990)10,4219,78794%201610,604(72)10,53212,121115%(1) Adjustments to Net Earnings relate to the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act in fiscal 2018, the losses on early debt extinguishment in fiscal 2018 and 2017, the gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands business in 2017, and the gain on the sale of the Batteries business and the Batteries impairment in fiscal 2016.Core EPS.  Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated.  Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time.  The table below provides a reconciliation of diluted net earnings per share to Core EPS, including the following reconciling items:•Incremental Restructuring:  The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities.  Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax.  In 2012, the Company began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that includes incremental restructuring activities.  In 2017, we communicated details of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan.  This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings.  The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs.  •Transitional Impacts of the U.S. Tax Act:  As discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “U.S. Tax Act”) in December 2017.  This resulted in a net charge of $602 million for the fiscal year 2018.  The adjustment to core earnings only includes this transitional impact.  It does not include the ongoing impacts of the lower U.S. statutory rate on current year earnings. •Early debt extinguishment charges:  In fiscal 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded after-tax charges of $243 million and $345 million, respectively, due to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt.  These charges represent the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished. •Charges for certain European legal matters:  Several countries in Europe issued separate complaints alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in prior periods.  In 2016, the Company incurred after-tax charges of $11 million to adjust legal reserves related to these matters. We do not view the above items to be indicative of underlying business results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of The Procter & Gamble Company (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).  Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.Strong internal controls is an objective that is reinforced through our Worldwide Business Conduct Manual, which sets forth our commitment to conduct business with integrity, and within both the letter and the spirit of the law.  Our people are deeply committed to our Purpose, Values, and Principles, which unite us in doing what’s right.  Our system of internal controls includes written policies and procedures, segregation of duties, and the careful selection and development of employees.  Additional key elements of our internal control structure include our Global Leadership Council, which is actively involved in oversight of the business strategies, initiatives, results and controls, our Disclosure Committee, which is responsible for evaluating disclosure implications of significant business activities and events, our Board of Directors, which provides strong and effective corporate governance, and our Audit Committee, which reviews significant accounting policies, financial reporting and internal control matters.The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes a Control Self-Assessment Program that is conducted annually for critical financial reporting areas of the Company and is audited by our Global Internal Audit organization.  Management takes the appropriate action to correct any identified control deficiencies.  Global Internal Audit also performs financial and compliance audits around the world, provides training, and continuously improves our internal control processes.Because of its inherent limitations, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, may not prevent or detect misstatements due to the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden or that misstatements due to error or fraud may occur that are not detected.  Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time.Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018, using criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018, based on these criteria.Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018, as stated in their report which is included herein./s/ David S.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 7, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.  Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion./s/ Deloitte & Touche LLPCincinnati, Ohio August 7, 2018 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1890.36        The Procter & Gamble CompanyREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Procter & Gamble CompanyOpinion on Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission(COSO).  In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, of the Company and our report dated August 7, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.Basis for OpinionThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Deloitte & Touche LLPCincinnati, Ohio August 7, 2018The Procter & Gamble Company        37Consolidated Statements of EarningsAmounts in millions except per share amounts; Years ended June 302018 2017 2016NET SALES$66,832 $65,058 $65,299Cost of products sold34,268 32,535 32,909Selling, general and administrative expense18,853 18,568 18,949OPERATING INCOME13,711 13,955 13,441Interest expense506 465 579Interest income247 171 182Other non-operating income/(expense), net(126) (404) 325EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES13,326 13,257 13,369Income taxes on continuing operations3,465 3,063 3,342NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS9,861 10,194 10,027NET EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS— 5,217 577NET EARNINGS9,861 15,411 10,604Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests111 85 96NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCTER & GAMBLE$9,750 $15,326 $10,508      BASIC NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE: (1)     Earnings from continuing operations$3.75 $3.79 $3.59Earnings from discontinued operations— 2.01 0.21BASIC NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE$3.75 $5.80 $3.80DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE: (1)     Earnings from continuing operations$3.67 $3.69 $3.49Earnings from discontinued operations— 1.90 0.20DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE$3.67 $5.59 $3.69DIVIDENDS PER COMMON SHARE$2.79 $2.70 $2.66(1) Basic net earnings per common share and Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble.

Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies.  We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.Basis of PresentationThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its controlled subsidiaries.  Intercompany transactions are eliminated. Because of a lack of control over Venezuela subsidiaries caused by a number of currency and other operating controls and restrictions, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not consolidated for any year presented.  We account for those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting.Use of EstimatesPreparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures.  These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future.  Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, consumer and trade promotion accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions, post-employment benefits, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax positions and contingencies.  Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates, although management does not generally believe such differences would materially affect the financial statements in any individual year.  However, in regard to ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus those anticipated at the time of the initial valuations, could result in impairment charges that materially affect the financial statements in a given year.Revenue RecognitionSales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned.  Revenue transactions represent sales of inventory.  The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities.   The revenue includes shipping and handling costs, which generally are included in the list price to the customer.  Our policy is to recognize revenue when title to the product, ownership and risk of loss transfer to the customer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer.  A provision for payment discounts and product return allowances is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period the revenue is recognized.Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers.  Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred, generally at the time of the sale.  Most of these arrangements have terms of approximately one year.  Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued marketing and promotion in the Accrued and other liabilities line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Cost of Products SoldCost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacturing of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expense necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished product.  Cost of products sold also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, internal transfer costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity.Selling, General and Administrative ExpenseSelling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) is primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items.  Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $1.9 billion in 2018, $1.9 billion in 2017 and $1.9 billion in 2016 (reported in Net earnings from continuing operations).  Advertising costs, charged to expense as incurred, include worldwide television, print, radio, internet and in-store advertising expenses and were $7.1 billion in 2018, $7.1 billion in 2017 and $7.2 billion in 2016 (reported in Net earnings from continuing operations).  Non-advertising related components of the Company's total marketing spending reported in SG&A include costs associated with consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids.Other Non-Operating Income/(Expense), NetOther non-operating income/(expense), net primarily includes net acquisition and divestiture gains, investment income and other non-operating items.Currency TranslationFinancial statements of operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency.  Adjustments to translate those statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in Other comprehensive income (OCI).  For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency.  Re-Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.The Procter & Gamble Company        43measurement adjustments for financial statements in highly inflationary economies and other transactional exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings.Cash Flow PresentationThe Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are prepared using the indirect method, which reconciles net earnings to cash flow from operating activities.  Cash flows from foreign currency transactions and operations are translated at an average exchange rate for the period.  Cash flows from hedging activities are included in the same category as the items being hedged.  Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified as financing activities.  Realized gains and losses from non-qualifying derivative instruments used to hedge currency exposures resulting from intercompany financing transactions are also classified as financing activities.  Cash flows from other derivative instruments used to manage interest, commodity or other currency exposures are classified as operating activities.  Cash payments related to income taxes are classified as operating activities.  Cash flows from the Company's discontinued operations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  See Note 13 for significant cash flow items related to discontinued operations.InvestmentsInvestment securities consist of readily marketable debt and equity securities.  Unrealized gains or losses from investments classified as trading, if any, are charged to earnings.  Unrealized gains or losses on securities classified as available-for-sale are generally recorded in OCI.  If an available-for-sale security is other than temporarily impaired, the loss is charged to either earnings or OCI depending on our intent and ability to retain the security until we recover the full cost basis and the extent of the loss attributable to the creditworthiness of the issuer.  Investment securities are included as Available-for-sale investment securities and Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Investments in certain companies over which we exert significant influence, but do not control the financial and operating decisions, are accounted for as equity method investments.  Other investments that are not controlled, and over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the cost method.  Both equity and cost method investments are included as Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Inventory ValuationInventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value.  Product-related inventories are maintained on the first-in, first-out method.  The cost of spare part inventories is maintained using the average-cost method.Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at cost reduced by accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation expense is recognized over the assets' estimated useful lives using the straight-line method.  Machinery and equipment includes office furniture and fixtures (15-year life), computer equipment and capitalized software (3- to 5-year lives) and manufacturing equipment (3-  to 20-year lives).  Buildings are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 40 years.  Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and, when appropriate, changes are made prospectively.  When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present.  Our annual impairment testing of goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. We have acquired brands that have been determined to have indefinite lives.  Those assets are evaluated annually for impairment.  We evaluate a number of factors to determine whether an indefinite life is appropriate, including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold.  In addition, when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an additional impairment assessment is performed and indefinite-lived assets may be adjusted to a determinable life.The cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, either on a straight-line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited.  Patents, technology and other intangible assets with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective legal or contractual lives.  Customer relationships, brands and other non-contractual intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over periods generally ranging from 5 to 30 years.  When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and remaining lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted.For additional details on goodwill and intangible assets see Note 4.Fair Values of Financial InstrumentsCertain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value.  Changes in assumptions or estimation methods could affect the fair value estimates; however, we do not believe any such changes would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  Other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, certain investments and short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.  The fair values of long-term debt and financial instruments are disclosed in Note 9.New Accounting Pronouncements and PoliciesIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)." This guidance outlines a single, comprehensive model of accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. We will adopt the standard on July 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method. Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.44        The Procter & Gamble Companyproduct to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single delivery element and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer.  Accordingly, the timing of revenue recognition is not materially impacted by the new standard.  The adoption of the new standard will impact the accrual timing for certain portions of our customer and consumer promotional spending, which will result in a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings of up to $350, net of tax, on the date of adoption.  The provisions of the new standard will also impact the classification of certain payments to customers, moving an immaterial amount of such payments (approximately $300) from expense to a deduction from net sales. This new guidance will not have any other material impacts on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including financial disclosures.In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)." The standard requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements. We plan to adopt the standard on July 1, 2019. We are currently assessing the impact that the new standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which will consist primarily of a balance sheet gross up of our operating leases to show equal and offsetting lease assets and lease liabilities. For additional details on operating leases, see Note 12.In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.”  The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring a goodwill impairment to be measured using a single step impairment model, whereby the impairment equals the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the specified reporting units in their entirety.  This eliminates the second step of the current impairment model that requires companies to first estimate the fair value of all assets in a reporting unit, and then measure impairments based on those fair values and a residual measurement approach.  It also specifies that any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  We will adopt the standard no later than July 1, 2020.  The impact of the new standard will be dependent on the specific facts and circumstances of future individual impairments, if any.In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, "Compensation-Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (Topic 715).”  This guidance requires an entity to disaggregate the current service cost component from the other components of net benefit costs in the face of the income statement.  It requires the service cost component to be presented with other current compensation costs for the related employees in the operating section of the income statement.  Other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented outside of income from operations.   We will adopt the standard retrospectively on July 1, 2018.  The adoption of ASU 2017-07 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.  We currently classify all net periodic pension costs within operating costs (as part of Cost of products sold and Selling,  general and administrative expense).  Had this standard been effective and adopted during fiscal 2018, Cost of products sold and Selling, general and administrative costs would have increased approximately $164 and $184, respectively, for the year ended June 30, 2018 with an offsetting change in Other non-operating income/(expense), net.   In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities." This standard enables entities to better portray the economics of their risk management activities in the financial statements and enhances the transparency and understandability of hedge results through improved disclosures. The new standard is effective for us beginning July 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt the new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The amended presentation and disclosure guidance was applied on a prospective basis. The primary impact of adoption is the required disclosure changes. The adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the cumulative-effect adjustment required upon adoption.No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.NOTE 2SEGMENT INFORMATIONDuring fiscal 2017, the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories, comprised of 43 of its beauty brands.  The transactions included the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and the fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands.  In fiscal 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of its Batteries business to Berkshire Hathaway.  Each of these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented (see Note 13).Under U.S. GAAP, our Global Business Units (GBUs) are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric & Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine & Family Care.  Our five reportable segments are comprised of:•Beauty:  Hair Care (Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments); Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care);•Grooming:  Shave Care (Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care); Appliances•Health Care:  Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care);  Personal  Health Care  (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care); •Fabric & Home Care:  Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care ); and•Baby, Feminine & Family Care:  Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper).Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.The Procter & Gamble Company        45The accounting policies of the segments are generally the same as those described in Note 1.  Differences between these policies and U.S. GAAP primarily reflect income taxes, which are reflected in the segments using applicable blended statutory rates.  Adjustments to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in Corporate, including the impacts from the U.S. Tax Act in fiscal 2018 (see Note 5). Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities that are not reflected in the operating results used internally to measure and evaluate the businesses, as well as items to adjust management reporting principles to U.S. GAAP.  Operating activities in Corporate include the results of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level.  Operating elements also include certain employee benefit costs, the costs of certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization, certain significant asset impairment charges and other general Corporate items.  The non-operating elements in Corporate primarily include interest expense, certain acquisition and divestiture gains, interest and investing income and other financing costs. Total assets for the reportable segments include those assets managed by the reportable segment, primarily inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets.  Other assets, primarily cash, accounts receivable, investment securities and goodwill, are included in Corporate. Our business units are comprised of similar product categories.  Nine business units individually accounted for 5% or more of consolidated net sales as follows: % of Sales by Business Unit (1)Years ended June 302018 2017 2016Fabric Care22% 22% 22%Baby Care13% 14% 14%Hair Care10% 10% 10%Home Care10% 10% 10%Skin and Personal Care9% 8% 8%Shave Care8% 9% 9%Family Care8% 8% 8%Oral Care8% 8% 8%Feminine Care6% 6% 6%All Other6% 5% 5%TOTAL100% 100% 100%(1) % of sales by business unit excludes sales held in Corporate.The Company had net sales in the U.S. of $27.3 billion, $27.3 billion and $27.0 billion for the years ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Long-lived assets in the U.S. totaled $9.7 billion and $8.8 billion as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Long-lived assets consists of property, plant and equipment.  No other country's net sales or long-lived assets exceed 10% of the Company totals.Our largest customer, Walmart Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for consolidated net sales of approximately 15%, 16% and 15% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  No other customer represents more than 10% of our consolidated net sales.Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.46        The Procter & Gamble CompanyGlobal Segment Results  Net Sales Earnings/(Loss)fromContinuingOperationsBeforeIncome Taxes Net Earnings/(Loss) from Continuing Operations DepreciationandAmortization TotalAssets CapitalExpendituresBEAUTY2018 $12,406 $3,042 $2,320 $236 $4,709 $766 2017 11,429 2,546 1,914 220 4,184 599 2016 11,477 2,636 1,975 218 3,888 435GROOMING2018 6,551 1,801 1,432 447 22,609 364 2017 6,642 1,985 1,537 433 22,759 341 2016 6,815 2,009 1,548 451 22,819 383HEALTH CARE2018 7,857 1,922 1,283 230 5,254 330 2017 7,513 1,898 1,280 209 5,194 283 2016 7,350 1,812 1,250 204 5,139 240FABRIC & HOME CARE2018 21,441 4,191 2,708 534 7,295 1,020 2017 20,717 4,249 2,713 513 6,886 797 2016 20,730 4,249 2,778 531 6,919 672BABY, FEMININE & FAMILY CARE2018 18,080 3,527 2,251 899 9,682 1,016 2017 18,252 3,868 2,503 874 9,920 1,197 2016 18,505 4,042 2,650 886 9,863 1,261CORPORATE (1)2018 497 (1,157) (133) 488 68,761 221 2017 505 (1,289) 247 571 71,463 167 2016 422 (1,379) (174) 788 78,508 323TOTAL COMPANY2018 $66,832 $13,326 $9,861 $2,834 $118,310 $3,717 2017 65,058 13,257 10,194 2,820 120,406 3,384 2016 65,299 13,369 10,027 3,078 127,136 3,314(1) The Corporate reportable segment includes depreciation and amortization, total assets and capital expenditures of the Beauty Brands and Batteries businesses prior to their divestiture.NOTE 3SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATIONThe components of property, plant and equipment were as follows:As of June 302018 2017PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENTBuildings$7,188 $6,943Machinery and equipment30,595 29,505Land841 765Construction in progress3,223 2,935TOTAL PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT41,847 40,148Accumulated depreciation(21,247) (20,255)PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET$20,600 $19,893 Selected components of current and noncurrent liabilities were as follows:As of June 302018 2017ACCRUED AND OTHER LIABILITIES - CURRENTMarketing and promotion$3,208 $2,792Compensation expenses1,298 1,344Restructuring reserves513 277Taxes payable268 449Legal and environmental156 168Other2,027 1,994TOTAL$7,470 $7,024OTHER NONCURRENT LIABILITIESPension benefits$4,768 $5,487Other postretirement benefits1,495 1,333Uncertain tax positions581 564U.S. Tax Act transitional tax payable2,654 —Other666 870TOTAL$10,164 $8,254Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.The Procter & Gamble Company        47RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMThe Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization.  Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually.  In fiscal 2012, the Company initiated an incremental restructuring program (covering fiscal 2012 through 2017) as part of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing activities and overhead expenses.  The productivity and cost savings plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes in order to help fund the Company's growth strategy.    Total restructuring costs incurred under the plan through fiscal 2017 was $5.6 billion, before tax.In fiscal 2017 the Company announced specific elements of another incremental multi-year productivity and cost savings plan to further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses.  This program is expected to result in incremental enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes.  Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs.  The Company incurred total restructuring charges of $1,070 and $754 for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  An additional amount of approximately $800 is expected to be incurred in fiscal 2019.  Of the charges incurred, $251 and $137 were recorded in SG&A for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively and $819 and $593 were recorded in Cost of products sold for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The remainder of the charges for fiscal 2017 were included in Net earnings from discontinued operations.  The following table presents restructuring activity for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:Amounts in millionsSeparationsAsset-Related CostsOtherTotalRESERVE JUNE 30, 2016$243$—$72$315Charges206397151754Cash spent (1)(221)—(174)(395)Charges against assets—(397)—(397)RESERVE JUNE 30, 2017228—49277Charges3103663941,070Cash spent(279)—(189)(468)Charges against assets—(366)—(366)RESERVE JUNE 30, 2018$259$—$254$513(1) Includes liabilities transferred to Coty related to our Beauty Brands divestiture. Separation CostsEmployee separation charges for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 relate to severance packages for approximately 2,720 and 2,120 employees, respectively.  The packages were primarily voluntary and the amounts were calculated based on salary levels and past service periods.  Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. Asset-Related CostsAsset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation.  Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal.  These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs.  Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period.  These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations.  The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges. Other CostsOther restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program.  Such charges primarily include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain optimization. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges are funded by and included within Corporate for both management and segment reporting.  Accordingly, all of the charges under the program are included within the Corporate reportable segment. However, for informative purposes, the following table summarizes the total restructuring costs related to our reportable segments:Years ended June 30201820172016Beauty$60$90$72Grooming384542Health Care211526Fabric & Home Care115144250Baby, Feminine & Family Care547231225Corporate (1)289229362Total Company$1,070$754$977(1) Corporate includes costs related to allocated overheads, including charges related to our Sales and Market Operations, Global Business Services and Corporate Functions activities, along with costs related to discontinued operations from our Batteries and Beauty Brands businesses.Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.48        The Procter & Gamble CompanyNOTE 4GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETSThe change in the net carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment was as follows: BeautyGroomingHealth CareFabric & Home CareBaby, Feminine & Family CareCorporateTotal CompanyBalance at June 30, 2016 - Net (1)$12,645$19,477$5,840$1,856$4,532$—$44,350Acquisitions and divestitures——(10)(3)(24)—(37)Translation and other14615048438—386Balance at June 30, 2017 - Net (1)12,79119,6275,8781,8574,546—44,699Acquisitions and divestitures82—————82Translation and other11919351823—394Balance at June 30, 2018 - Net (1)$12,992$19,820$5,929$1,865$4,569$—$45,175(1) Grooming goodwill balance is net of $1.2 billion accumulated impairment losses. During fiscal 2017, the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories, comprised of 43 of its beauty brands ("Beauty Brands").  The transactions included the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color and cosmetics businesses and the fine fragrances business, along with select hair styling brands (see Note 13).  The Beauty Brands had historically been part of the Company's Beauty reportable segment.  In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the Beauty Brands are presented as discontinued operations.  As a result, the goodwill attributable to the Beauty Brands as of June 30, 2016 is excluded from the preceding table.The change in goodwill during fiscal 2018 was primarily due to acquisitions of two brands within the Beauty reportable segment and currency translation across all reportable segments.  The change in goodwill during fiscal 2017 was primarily due to minor brand divestitures and currency translation across all reportable segments.The goodwill and intangible asset valuations that are utilized to test these assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion, Company business plans and the discount rate applied to cash flows.  We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and are comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.  However, actual events and results could differ substantially from those used in our valuations.  To the extent such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows initially used to estimate fair value for purposes of establishing the carrying amount of goodwill and related intangible assets, we may need to record non-cash impairment charges in the future. Identifiable intangible assets were comprised of: 2018 2017As of June 30GrossCarryingAmountAccumulatedAmortization GrossCarryingAmountAccumulatedAmortizationINTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DETERMINABLE LIVESBrands$3,146$(2,046) $3,094$(1,898)Patents and technology2,617(2,350) 2,617(2,261)Customer relationships1,372(616) 1,377(564)Other241(144) 239(132)TOTAL$7,376$(5,156) $7,327$(4,855)      INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVESBrands21,682— 21,715—TOTAL$29,058$(5,156) $29,042$(4,855)Amortization expense of intangible assets was as follows:Years ended June 302018 2017 2016Intangible asset amortization$302 $325 $388Estimated amortization expense over the next five fiscal years is as follows:Years ending June 3020192020202120222023Estimated amortization expense$280$254$205$188$177Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.The Procter & Gamble Company        49NOTE 5INCOME TAXESIncome taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable for the current year and for the impact of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which represent future tax consequences of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using the enacted statutory tax rates and are adjusted for any changes in such rates in the period of change.On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "U.S. Tax Act").  The U.S. Tax Act significantly revises the future ongoing U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rates and implementing a hybrid territorial tax system.  As the Company has a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate was phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 28% for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and 21% for subsequent fiscal years.  However, the U.S. Tax Act eliminates the domestic manufacturing deduction and moves to a hybrid territorial system, which also largely eliminates the ability to credit certain foreign taxes that existed prior to enactment of the U.S. Tax Act.There are also certain transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act.  As part of the transition to the new hybrid territorial tax system, the U.S. Tax Act imposed a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries.  In addition, the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate caused us to adjust our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower federal base rate of 21%.  These transitional impacts resulted in a provisional net charge of $602 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, comprised of an estimated repatriation tax charge of $3.8 billion (comprised of U.S. repatriation taxes and foreign withholding taxes) and an estimated net deferred tax benefit of $3.2 billion.The changes included in the U.S. Tax Act are broad and complex.  The final transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act may differ from the above estimate, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the U.S. Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the U.S. Tax Act, or any updates or changes to estimates the Company has utilized to calculate the transitional impacts, which we expect to finalize when we complete our tax return for fiscal 2018.  The SEC has issued rules that would allow for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the U.S. Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts.  We currently anticipate finalizing and recording any resulting adjustments within the one-year time period provided by the SEC.Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes consisted of the following:Years ended June 302018 2017 2016United States$9,277 $9,031 $8,788International4,049 4,226 4,581TOTAL$13,326 $13,257 $13,369 Income taxes on continuing operations consisted of the following:Years ended June 302018 2017 2016CURRENT TAX EXPENSEU.S. federal$3,965 $1,531 $1,673International1,131 1,243 1,483U.S. state and local213 241 224 5,309 3,015 3,380DEFERRED TAX EXPENSEU.S. federal(1,989) 28 33International and other145 20 (71) (1,844) 48 (38)TOTAL TAX EXPENSE$3,465 $3,063 $3,342A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to our actual income tax rate on continuing operations is provided below:Years ended June 302018 2017 2016U.S. federal statutory income tax rate28.1 % 35.0 % 35.0 %Country mix impacts of foreign operations(4.7)% (6.8)% (9.1)%Changes in uncertain tax positions(0.3)% (2.0)% (0.5)%Excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options(0.4)% (1.3)% — %Net transitional impact of U.S. Tax Act4.5 % — % — %Other(1.2)% (1.8)% (0.4)%EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE26.0 % 23.1 % 25.0 %Country mix impacts of foreign operations includes the effects of foreign subsidiaries' earnings taxed at rates other than the U.S. statutory rate, the U.S. tax impacts of non-U.S. earnings repatriation and any net impacts of intercompany transactions.

Excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options reflect the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09, "Stock Compensation (Topic 718):  Improvements to Employee-Share-Based Payment Accounting)."Tax benefits charged to shareholders' equity totaled $342 for the year ended June 30, 2018.  This primarily relates to the tax effects of Net Investment hedges, partially offset by the impact of certain adjustments to pension obligations recorded in stockholders' equity.  Tax costs credited to shareholders' equity totaled $333 for the year ended June 30, 2017.  This primarily relates to the impact of certain adjustments to pension obligations recorded in stockholders' equity, partially offset by the tax effects of Net Investment hedges.Prior to the passage of the U.S. Tax Act, the Company asserted that substantially all of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely invested and Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.50        The Procter & Gamble Companyaccordingly, no deferred taxes were provided.  Pursuant to the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, these earnings were subjected to a one-time transition tax, for which a provisional charge has been recorded.  This charge included provisional taxes for all U.S. income taxes and for the related foreign withholding taxes for the portion of those earnings which are no longer considered indefinitely invested.  We have not provided deferred foreign withholding taxes on approximately $33 billion of earnings that are considered permanently reinvested.A reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability for uncertain tax positions is as follows:Years ended June 302018 2017 2016BEGINNING OF YEAR$465 $857 $1,096Increases in tax positions for prior years26 87 124Decreases in tax positions for prior years(38) (147) (97)Increases in tax positions for current year87 75 97Settlements with taxing authorities(45) (381) (301)Lapse in statute of limitations(20) (22) (39)Currency translation(5) (4) (23)END OF YEAR$470 $465 $857Included in the total liability for uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2018, is $251 that, depending on the ultimate resolution, could impact the effective tax rate in future periods.The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40-50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion.  We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable.  Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and the closing of statutes of limitation.  Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate.  We have tax years open ranging from 2008 and forward.  We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit.  While we do not expect material changes, it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to our uncertain tax positions could increase or decrease within the next 12 months.  At this time, we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of uncertain tax positions or the impact on the effective tax rate related to any such changes. We recognize the additional accrual of any possible related interest and penalties relating to the underlying uncertain tax position in income tax expense.  As of June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had accrued interest of $99, $100 and $323 and accrued penalties of $15, $20 and $20, respectively, which are not included in the above table.  During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized $(22), $62 and $2 in interest benefit/(expense) and $(5), $0 and $(2) in penalties benefit/(expense), respectively.  The net benefits recognized resulted primarily from the favorable resolution of tax positions for prior years.Deferred income tax assets and liabilities were comprised of the following:As of June 302018 2017DEFERRED TAX ASSETS   Pension and postretirement benefits$1,478 $1,775Loss and other carryforwards1,067 1,516Stock-based compensation476 732Fixed assets223 212Accrued marketing and promotion223 210Unrealized loss on financial and foreign exchange transactions61 259Inventory35 75Accrued interest and taxes17 30Advance payments4 121Other699 709Valuation allowances(457) (505)TOTAL$3,826 $5,134    DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES   Goodwill and intangible assets$6,168 $9,403Fixed assets1,276 1,495Foreign withholding tax on earnings to be repatriated244 —Unrealized gain on financial and foreign exchange transactions169 314Other161 26TOTAL$8,018 $11,238Net operating loss carryforwards were $3.5 billion and $3.3 billion at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated using the treasury stock method on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards (see Note 7) and the assumed conversion of preferred stock (see Note 8).Net earnings per share were as follows:Years ended June 302018 2017 2016CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTSTotal Continuing OperationsDiscontinued OperationsTotal Continuing OperationsDiscontinued OperationsTotalNet earnings$9,861 $10,194$5,217$15,411 $10,027$577$10,604Less:  Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests111 85—85 96—96Net earnings attributable to P&G (Diluted)9,750 10,1095,21715,326 9,93157710,508Preferred dividends, net of tax(265) (247)—(247) (255)—(255)Net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic)$9,485 $9,862$5,217$15,079 $9,676$577$10,253SHARES IN MILLIONS         Basic weighted average common shares outstanding2,529.3 2,598.12,598.12,598.1 2,698.92,698.92,698.9Add:  Effect of dilutive securities         Conversion of preferred shares(1)94.9 99.399.399.3 103.9103.9103.9Impact of stock options and other unvested equity awards (2)32.5 43.043.043.0 41.641.641.6Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding2,656.7 2,740.42,740.42,740.4 2,844.42,844.42,844.4NET EARNINGS PER SHARE (3)         Basic$3.75 $3.79$2.01$5.80 $3.59$0.21$3.80Diluted$3.67 $3.69$1.90$5.59 $3.49$0.20$3.69(1) Despite being included currently in Diluted net earnings per common share, the actual conversion to common stock occurs when the preferred shares are sold.

All options vest after three years and have a 10-year life.  Exercise prices on options are set equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of the grant.  Effective in fiscal year 2017, RSUs vest and settle in shares of common stock three years from the grant date.  RSUs granted prior to fiscal years 2017 vest and settle in shares of common stock five years from the grant date.Senior-level executives participate in an additional long-term incentive program that awards PSUs, which are paid in shares after the end of a three-year performance period.  Under this program, the number of PSUs that will vest is based on the Company's performance relative to pre-established performance goals during that three year period.In addition to these long-term incentive programs, we award RSUs to the Company's non-employee directors and make other minor stock option and RSU grants to employees for which the terms are not substantially different from our long-term incentive awards.A total of 185 million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the stock-based compensation plan approved by shareholders in 2014, of which 65 million shares remain available for grant.The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards at the date of grant.  The fair value is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are recognized as compensation expense from the grant date through the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide services to earn the award.  Stock-based compensation expense is included as part of Cost of products sold and SG&A in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and includes an estimate of forfeitures, which is based on historical data.

Expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatilities of call options on our stock.  We use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination patterns within the valuation model.  The expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.  The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.A summary of options outstanding under the plans as of June 30, 2018 and activity during the year then ended is presented below:OptionsOptions (in thousands)Weighted Average Exercise PriceWeighted Average Contract-ual Life in YearsAggregate Intrinsic ValueOutstanding, beginning of year206,485$72.46  Granted20,29282.19  Exercised(19,622)63.44  Canceled(1,501)82.92  OUTSTANDING, END OF YEAR205,654$74.215.3$1,349EXERCISABLE143,169$69.963.8$1,326The following table provides additional information on stock options:Years ended June 302018 2017 2016Weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted$11.89 $10.45 $8.48Intrinsic value of options exercised500 1,334 1,388Grant-date fair value of options that vested209 246 200Cash received from options exercised1,245 2,630 2,332Actual tax benefit from options exercised127 421 433Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.The Procter & Gamble Company        53At June 30, 2018, there was $203 of compensation cost that has not yet been recognized related to stock option grants.

The total grant date fair value of shares vested was $175, $163 and $97 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.The Company settles equity issuances with treasury shares.  We have no specific policy to repurchase common shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of options, RSUs and PSUs.  However, we have historically made adequate discretionary purchases, based on cash availability, market trends and other factors, to offset the impacts of such activity. NOTE 8POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANWe offer various postretirement benefits to our employees.Defined Contribution Retirement PlansWe have defined contribution plans, which cover the majority of our U.S. employees, as well as employees in certain other countries.  These plans are fully funded.  We generally make contributions to participants' accounts based on individual base salaries and years of service.  Total global defined contribution expense was $292, $270 and $292 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.The primary U.S. defined contribution plan (the U.S. DC plan) comprises the majority of the expense for the Company's defined contribution plans.  For the U.S. DC plan, the contribution rate is set annually.  Total contributions for this plan approximated 14% of total participants' annual wages and salaries in 2018, 2017 and 2016.We maintain The Procter & Gamble Profit Sharing Trust (Trust) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) to provide a portion of the funding for the U.S. DC plan and other retiree benefits (described below).  Operating details of the ESOP are provided at the end of this Note.  The fair value of the ESOP Series A shares allocated to participants reduces our cash contribution required to fund the U.S. DC plan.Defined Benefit Retirement Plans and Other Retiree BenefitsWe offer defined benefit retirement pension plans to certain employees.  These benefits relate primarily to local plans outside the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, plans assumed in previous acquisitions covering U.S. employees.We also provide certain other retiree benefits, primarily health care and life insurance, for the majority of our U.S. employees who become eligible for these benefits when they meet minimum age and service requirements.  Generally, the health care plans require cost sharing with retirees and pay a stated percentage of expenses, reduced by deductibles and other coverages.  These benefits are primarily funded by ESOP Series B shares and certain other assets contributed by the Company.Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.54        The Procter & Gamble CompanyObligation and Funded Status.

We determine our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis.  These assumptions are weighted to reflect each country that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.

For the remaining plans, the Company determines these amounts utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the corporate bond yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. Several factors are considered in developing the estimate for the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets.  For the defined benefit retirement plans, these factors include historical rates of return of broad equity and bond indices and projected long-term rates of return obtained from pension investment consultants.  The expected long-term rates of return for plan assets are 8 - 9% for equities and 5 - 6% for bonds.  For other retiree benefit plans, the expected long-term rate of return reflects that the assets are comprised primarily of Company stock.  The expected rate of return on Company stock is based on the long-term projected return of 8.5% and reflects the historical pattern of returns.Assumed health care cost trend rates could have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other retiree benefit plans.

Our investment objective for defined benefit retirement plan assets is to meet the plans' benefit obligations and to improve plan self-sufficiency for future benefit obligations.  The investment strategies focus on asset class diversification, liquidity to meet benefit payments and an appropriate balance of long-term investment return and risk.  Target ranges for asset allocations are determined by assessing different investment risks and matching the actuarial projections of the plans' future liabilities and benefit payments with current as well as expected long-term rates of return on the assets, taking into account investment return volatility and correlations across asset classes.  Plan assets are diversified across several investment managers and are generally invested in liquid funds that are selected to track broad market equity and bond indices.  Investment risk is carefully controlled with plan assets rebalanced to target allocations on a periodic basis and with continual monitoring of investment managers' performance relative to the investment guidelines established with each investment manager.Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.The Procter & Gamble Company        57Our target asset allocation for the year ended June 30, 2018, and actual asset allocation by asset category as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, were as follows: Target Asset Allocation Actual Asset Allocation at June 30 Pension Benefits Other RetireeBenefits Pension Benefits Other Retiree BenefitsAsset Category  2018 2017 2018 2017Cash—% 2% 2% 2% 1% 1%Debt securities65% 3% 59% 53% 4% 4%Equity securities35% 95% 39% 45% 95% 95%TOTAL100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%The following tables set forth the fair value of the Company's plan assets as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy (refer to Note 9 for further discussion on the fair value hierarchy and fair value principles).  Company stock listed as Level 2 in the hierarchy represents preferred shares which are valued based on the value of Company common stock.  The majority of our Level 3 pension assets are insurance contracts.  Their fair values are based on their cash equivalent or models that project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs, including credit risk and interest rate curves.  There was no significant activity within the Level 3 pension and other retiree benefits plan assets during the years presented.  Investments valued using net asset value as a practical expedient are primarily equity and fixed income collective funds.  These assets are not valued using the fair value hierarchy, but rather valued using the net asset value reported by the managers of the funds and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions.  Pension Benefits Other Retiree BenefitsAs of June 30Fair Value Hierarchy Level 2018 2017 Fair Value Hierarchy Level 2018 2017ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE           Cash and cash equivalents1 $136 $134 1 $5 $6Company stock (1)  — — 2 3,092 3,643Other (2)1, 2 & 3 400 165 1 4  7TOTAL ASSETS IN THE FAIR VALUE HEIRARCHY  536 299   3,101 3,656Investments valued at net asset value  10,731  10,530   158  175TOTAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE  $11,267 10,829   $3,259  3,831(1) Company stock is net of ESOP debt discussed below.(2) The Company's other pension plan assets measured at fair value are generally classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.

Management's best estimate of cash requirements and discretionary contributions for the defined benefit retirement plans and other retiree benefit plans for the year ending June 30, 2019, is $134 and $39, respectively.  For the defined benefit retirement plans, this is comprised of $82 in expected benefit payments from the Company directly to participants of unfunded plans and $52 of expected contributions to funded plans.  For other retiree benefit plans, this is comprised of $24 in expected benefit payments from the Company directly to participants of unfunded plans and $15 of expected contributions to funded plans.  Expected contributions are dependent on many variables, including the variability of the market value of the plan assets as compared to the benefit obligation and other market or regulatory conditions.  In addition, we take into consideration our business investment opportunities and resulting cash requirements.  Accordingly, actual funding may differ significantly from current estimates. Total benefit payments expected to be paid to participants, which include payments funded from the Company's assets and payments from the plans are as follows:Years ending June 30PensionBenefits Other RetireeBenefitsEXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS  2019$517 $1942020508 2072021545 2192022557 2312023577 2412024 - 20283,280 1,339Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.58        The Procter & Gamble CompanyEmployee Stock Ownership PlanWe maintain the ESOP to provide funding for certain employee benefits discussed in the preceding paragraphs.The ESOP borrowed $1.0 billion in 1989 and the proceeds were used to purchase Series A ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion of the U.S. DC plan.  Principal and interest requirements of the borrowing were paid by the Trust from dividends on the preferred shares and from advances provided by the Company.  The original borrowing of $1.0 billion has been repaid in full, and advances from the Company of $52 remain outstanding at June 30, 2018.  Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of the Company's common stock.  The dividend for the current year was equal to the common stock dividend of $2.79 per share. The liquidation value is $6.82 per share.In 1991, the ESOP borrowed an additional $1.0 billion.  The proceeds were used to purchase Series B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion of retiree health care benefits.  These shares, net of the ESOP's debt, are considered plan assets of the other retiree benefits plan discussed above.  Debt service requirements are funded by preferred stock dividends, cash contributions and advances provided by the Company, of which $825 are outstanding at June 30, 2018.  Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of the Company's common stock.  The dividend for the current year was equal to the common stock dividend of $2.79 per share.  The liquidation value is $12.96 per share.Our ESOP accounting practices are consistent with current ESOP accounting guidance, including the permissible continuation of certain provisions from prior accounting guidance.  ESOP debt, which is guaranteed by the Company, is recorded as debt (see Note 10) with an offset to the Reserve for ESOP debt retirement, which is presented within Shareholders' equity.  Advances to the ESOP by the Company are recorded as an increase in the Reserve for ESOP debt retirement.  Interest incurred on the ESOP debt is recorded as Interest expense.  Dividends on all preferred shares, net of related tax benefits, are charged to Retained earnings.The series A and B preferred shares of the ESOP are allocated to employees based on debt service requirements.  The number of preferred shares outstanding at June 30 was as follows:Shares in thousands2018 2017 2016Allocated34,233 36,488 39,241Unallocated4,117 5,060 6,095TOTAL SERIES A38,350 41,548 45,336    Allocated25,895 25,378 23,925Unallocated28,512 30,412 32,319TOTAL SERIES B54,407 55,790 56,244For purposes of calculating diluted net earnings per common share, the preferred shares held by the ESOP are considered converted from inception. NOTE 9RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSAs a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices.  We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting.  To the extent we choose to manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions that we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices.If the Company elects to do so and if the instrument meets certain specified accounting criteria, management designates derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net investment hedges. We record derivative instruments at fair value and the accounting for changes in the fair value depends on the intended use of the derivative, the resulting designation and the effectiveness of the instrument in offsetting the risk exposure it is designed to hedge.  We generally have a high degree of effectiveness between the exposure being hedged and the hedging instrument.Credit Risk ManagementWe have counterparty credit guidelines and normally enter into transactions with investment grade financial institutions, to the extent commercially viable.  Counterparty exposures are monitored daily and downgrades in counterparty credit ratings are reviewed on a timely basis.  We have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, material credit losses on our risk management or other financial instruments.Substantially all of the Company's financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting and collateral agreements with counterparties.  If the Company's credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangements.  The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position as of June 30, 2018, was not material.  The Company has not been required to post collateral as a result of these contractual features.Interest Rate Risk ManagementOur policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt.  To manage this risk in a cost-efficient manner, we enter into interest rate swaps whereby we agree to exchange with the counterparty, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional amount.We designate certain interest rate swaps that meet specific accounting criteria as fair value hedges.  For fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in earnings.  Historically, we had interest rate swaps Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.The Procter & Gamble Company        59designated as cash flow hedges.  For the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, we did not have any contracts outstanding. Foreign Currency Risk ManagementWe manufacture and sell our products and finance our operations in a number of countries throughout the world.  As a result, we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.  We leverage the Company’s diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge. In certain cases, we enter into non-qualifying foreign currency contracts to hedge certain balance sheet items subject to revaluation. The change in fair value of these instruments and the underlying exposure are both immediately recognized in earnings. To manage exchange rate risk related to our intercompany financing, we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps.  The change in fair value of these non-qualifying instruments is immediately recognized in earnings, substantially offsetting the foreign currency mark-to-market impact of the related exposure.  Historically, we had certain foreign currency swaps with original maturities up to five years, which were intended to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies; these swaps were accounted for as cash flow hedges.  Those swaps were terminated during the year ended June 30, 2017 and as a result, there was an immaterial gain reclassified from AOCI into earnings for the year ended June 30, 2017 in the following tables but there were no outstanding contracts as of June 30, 2018 and 2017.  Net Investment HedgingWe hedge certain net investment positions in foreign subsidiaries.  To accomplish this, we either borrow directly in foreign currencies and designate all or a portion of the foreign currency debt as a hedge of the applicable net investment position or we enter into foreign currency swaps that are designated as hedges of net investments.  Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in OCI and offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged.  Upon adoption of ASU 2017-12, the time value component of the net investment hedge currency swaps is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and reported in income on a systematic basis. Changes in the fair value of the swap, including changes in the fair value of the excluded time value component, are recognized in OCI and offset the value of the underlying net assets.Commodity Risk Management Certain raw materials used in our products or production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors.  To manage the volatility related to anticipated purchases of certain of these materials, we have historically, on a limited basis, used futures and options with maturities generally less than one year and swap contracts with maturities up to five years.  As of and during the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, we did not have any commodity hedging activity. InsuranceWe self-insure for most insurable risks.  However, we purchase insurance for Directors and Officers Liability and certain other coverage where it is required by law or by contract.Fair Value HierarchyAccounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:•Level 1:  Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.•Level 2:  Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.•Level 3:  Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets.When applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets or liabilities during the year.  Our fair value estimates take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and our counterparties.When active market quotes are not available for financial assets and liabilities, we use industry standard valuation models.  Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including credit risk, interest rate curves, foreign currency rates and forward and spot prices for currencies.  In circumstances where market-based observable inputs are not available, management judgment is used to develop assumptions to estimate fair value.  Generally, the fair value of our Level 3 instruments is estimated as the net present value of expected future cash flows based on external inputs. The following table sets forth the Company's financial assets as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period: Fair Value AssetAs of June 302018 2017Investments:   U.S. government securities$5,544 $6,297Corporate bond securities3,737 3,271Other investments141 132TOTAL$9,422 $9,700Investment securities are presented in Available-for-sale investment securities and Other noncurrent assets.  The amortized cost of the U.S. government securities with maturities less than one year was $2,003 and $2,494 as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The amortized cost of the U.S. government securities with maturities between one and five years was $3,659 and $3,824 as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The amortized cost of corporate bond securities with maturities of less than a year was $1,291 and $730 as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.60        The Procter & Gamble Companyamortized cost of corporate bond securities with maturities between one and five years was $2,503 and $2,547 as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The Company's investments measured at fair value are generally classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  There are no material investment balances classified as Level 1 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, or using net asset value as a practical expedient.  Fair values are generally estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments.The fair value of long-term debt was $23,402 and $21,396 as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  This includes the  current portion of debt instruments ($1,769 and $1,694 as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively).  Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value.  All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost, but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes.  We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments.Disclosures about Financial InstrumentsThe notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 are as follows: Notional Amount Fair Value Asset Fair Value (Liability)As of June 302018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS      Interest rate contracts$4,587 $4,552 $125 $180 $(53) $(2)DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS      Foreign currency interest rate contracts$1,848 $6,102 $41 $14 $(75) $(177)TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS$6,435 $10,654 $166 $194 $(128) $(179)            DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS      Foreign currency contracts$7,358 $4,969 $30 $25 $(56) $(7)            TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE$13,793 $15,623 $196 $219 $(184) $(186)All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets.  All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities.  The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/liability directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation.  The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $4,639 and $4,705 as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges.  The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $15,012 and $19,030 as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The decrease in the notional balance of the net investment hedges, including the debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, is primarily driven by the reduction in net foreign currency hedgeable assets as a result of US tax reform.  The increase in the notional balance of foreign currency contracts not designated as hedging instruments reflects changes in the level of intercompany financing activity during the period. All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter.  There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented.  In addition, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented.  There were no significant assets or liabilities that were re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.The Procter & Gamble Company        61Before tax gains/(losses) on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows: Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in AOCI on DerivativesAs of June 302018 2017DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS (1) (2)Foreign currency interest rate contracts$(34) $(163)     Amount of Gain/(Loss) Reclassified from AOCI into EarningsYears ended June 302018 2017DERIVATIVES IN CASH FLOW HEDGING RELATIONSHIPSForeign currency contracts$— $69     Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in EarningsYears ended June 302018 2017DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPSInterest rate contracts$(106) $(193)DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTSForeign currency contracts$(1) $59(1) For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain/(loss) excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $138 and $48 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.(2) In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges.  The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in AOCI for such instruments was $367 and $161, as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.The gain/(loss) reclassified from AOCI into earnings on the derivatives in cash flow hedging relationships is recognized in the same period during which the related item affects earnings.  Such amounts related to foreign currency contracts are included in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in SG&A.  The gain/(loss) on the derivatives in fair value hedging relationships is fully offset by the mark-to-market impact of the related exposure.  These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in Interest Expense.  The gain/(loss) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure.  These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in SG&A.Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.62        The Procter & Gamble CompanyNOTE 10SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT As of June 302018 2017DEBT DUE WITHIN ONE YEARCurrent portion of long-term debt$1,772 $1,676Commercial paper7,761 11,705Loan due August 2018800 —Other90 173TOTAL$10,423 $13,554Short-term weighted average interest rates (1)0.7% 0.5%(1) Short-term weighted average interest rates include the effects of interest rate swaps discussed in Note 9.As of June 302018 2017LONG-TERM DEBT   1.60% USD note due November 20181,000 1,0001.75% USD note due October 2019600 —1.90% USD note due November 2019550 5500.28% JPY note due May 2020903 8941.90% USD note due October 2020600 —4.13% EUR note due December 2020698 6869.36% ESOP debentures due 2018-2021 (1)327 4171.85% USD note due February 2021600 6001.70% USD note due November 2021875 8752.00% EUR note due November 2021873 8582.30% USD note due February 20221,000 1,0002.15% USD note due August 20221,250 —2.00% EUR note due August 20221,164 1,1443.10% USD note due August 20231,000 1,0001.13% EUR note due November 20231,455 1,4300.50% EUR note due October 2024582 —2.70% USD note due February 2026600 6002.45% USD note due November 2026875 8754.88% EUR note due May 20271,164 1,1442.85% USD note due August 2027750 —1.25% EUR note due October 2029582 —5.55% USD note due March 2037763 1,1303.50% USD note due October 2047600 —Capital lease obligations107 51All other long-term debt3,717 5,460Current portion of long-term debt(1,772) (1,676)TOTAL$20,863 $18,038Long-term weighted average interest rates (2)2.5% 2.6%(1) Debt issued by the ESOP is guaranteed by the Company and is recorded as debt of the Company, as discussed in Note 8.(2) Long-term weighted average interest rates include the effects of interest rate swaps discussed in Note 9. Long-term debt maturities during the next five fiscal years are as follows:Years ending June 3020192020202120222023Debt maturities$1,772$2,621$2,034$2,839$2,498The Procter & Gamble Company fully and unconditionally guarantees the registered debt and securities issued by its 100% owned finance subsidiaries.Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.The Procter & Gamble Company        63NOTE 11ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS)The table below presents the changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI), including the reclassifications out of Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) by component:Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) by Component Hedges Investment Securities Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Financial Statement Translation Total AOCIBALANCE at JUNE 30, 2016$(2,641) $34 $(5,798) $(7,502) $(15,907)OCI before reclassifications (1)(237) (49) 910 356 980Amounts reclassified from AOCI (2)(69) (10) 491 (117) 295Net current period OCI(306) (59) 1,401 239 1,275BALANCE at JUNE 30, 2017(2,947) (25) (4,397) (7,263) (14,632)OCI before reclassifications (3)(299) (141) 74 (6) (372)Amounts reclassified from AOCI (4)— (7) 260 — 253Net current period OCI(299) (148) 334 (6) (119)Less:  Other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests— — (5) 3 (2)BALANCE at JUNE 30, 2018$(3,246) $(173) $(4,058) $(7,272) $(14,749)(1) Net of tax (benefit) / expense of $(186), $(6) and $360 for gains/losses on hedges, investment securities and pension and other retiree benefit items, respectively, for the period ended June 30, 2017.(2) Net of tax (benefit) / expense of $0, $0 and $191 for gains/losses on hedges, investment securities and pension and other retiree benefit items, respectively, for the period ended June 30, 2017.(3) Net of tax (benefit) / expense of $(279), $0 and $(23) for gains/losses on hedges, investment securities and pension and other retiree benefit items, respectively, for the period ended June 30, 2018.(4) Net of tax (benefit) / expense of $0, $0 and $91 for gains/losses on hedges, investment securities and pension and other retiree benefit items, respectively, for the period ended June 30, 2018.The below provides additional details on amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statement of Earnings:•Hedges:  see Note 9 for classification of gains and losses from hedges in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.•Investment securities:  amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net.•Pension and other retiree benefits:  amounts reclassified from AOCI into Cost of product sold, SG&A, and Net earnings from discontinued operations and included in the computation of net periodic pension cost (see Note 8 for additional details).•Financial statement translation:  amounts reclassified from AOCI into Net earnings from discontinued operations.  These amounts relate to accumulated translation associated with foreign entities sold as part of the sale of the Beauty Brands business.NOTE 12COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESGuaranteesIn conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, we may provide routine indemnifications (e.g., indemnification for representations and warranties and retention of previously existing environmental, tax and employee liabilities) for which terms range in duration and, in some circumstances, are not explicitly defined.  The maximum obligation under some indemnifications is also not explicitly stated and, as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated.  Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications.  We believe that if we were to incur a loss on any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In certain situations, we guarantee loans for suppliers and customers.  The total amount of guarantees issued under such arrangements is not material.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that have a material impact on our financial statements.  Purchase Commitments and Operating LeasesWe have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment as part of the normal course of business.  Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations are as follows: Years ending June 3020192020202120222023There-afterPurchase obligations$778$111$56$34$13$137Such amounts represent minimum commitments under take-or-pay agreements with suppliers and are in line with expected Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.64        The Procter & Gamble Companyusage.  These amounts include purchase commitments related to service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced to third-party suppliers. Such amounts also include arrangements with suppliers that qualify as embedded operating leases.   Due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early termination.  We do not expect to incur penalty payments under these provisions that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.We also lease certain property and equipment for varying periods.  Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases, net of guaranteed sublease income, are as follows: Years ending June 3020192020202120222023There-afterOperating leases$275$240$202$172$153$296LitigationWe are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax.While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices.  Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.NOTE 13DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSOn October 1, 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories to Coty, Inc. (“Coty”).  The divestiture included 41 of the Company's beauty brands (“Beauty Brands”), including the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and a majority of the fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands.  The form of the divestiture transaction was a Reverse Morris Trust split-off, in which P&G shareholders were given the election to exchange their P&G shares for shares of a new corporation that held the Beauty Brands (Galleria Co.), and then immediately exchange those shares for Coty shares.  The value P&G received in the transaction was $11.4 billion.  The value was comprised of 105 million shares of common stock of the Company, which were tendered by shareholders of the Company and exchanged for the Galleria Co. shares, valued at approximately $9.4 billion, and the assumption of $1.9 billion of debt by Galleria Co.  The shares tendered in the  transaction were reflected as an addition to treasury stock and the cash received related to the debt assumed by Coty was reflected as an investing activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the final transaction of $5.3 billion, net of transaction and related costs.Two of the fine fragrance brands, Dolce & Gabbana and Christina Aguilera, were excluded from the divestiture.  These brands were subsequently divested at amounts that approximated their adjusted carrying values.In February 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of its Batteries business to Berkshire Hathaway (BH) via a split transaction, in which the Company exchanged the Duracell Company, which the Company had infused with additional cash, to repurchase all 52.5 million shares of P&G stock owned by BH.  During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded non-cash, before-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived asset impairment charges of $402 ($350 after tax), to reduce the Batteries carrying value to the total estimated proceeds based on the value of BH’s shares in P&G stock at the time of the impairment charges (see Note 4).  The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the final transaction of $422 to reflect a subsequent increase in the final value of the BH’s shares in P&G stock.  The total value of the transaction was $4.2 billion representing the value of the Duracell business and the cash infusion.  The cash infusion of $1.7 billion was reflected as a purchase of treasury stock.In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of the Beauty Brands and Batteries businesses are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. The Beauty Brands were historically part of the Company's Beauty reportable segment.  The Batteries business was historically part of the Company's Fabric & Home Care reportable segment. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.The Procter & Gamble Company        65On July 1, 2015, the Company adopted ASU 2014-08, which included new reporting and disclosure requirements for discontinued operations.  The new requirements are effective for discontinued operations occurring on or after the adoption date, which includes the Beauty Brands divestiture.  Discontinued operations prior to July 1, 2015, which included the Batteries divestiture, are reported based on the previous disclosure requirements for discontinued operations.The following table summarizes Net earnings from discontinued operations and reconciles to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings:Years ended June 302017 2016Beauty Brands$5,217 $336Batteries— 241Net earnings from discontinued operations$5,217 $577The following is selected financial information included in Net earnings from discontinued operations for the Beauty Brands: Beauty BrandsYears ended June 302017 2016Net sales$1,159 $4,910Cost of products sold450 1,621Selling, general and administrative expense783 2,763Intangible asset impairment charges— 48Interest expense14 32Interest income— 2Other non-operating income/(expense), net16 9Earnings/(loss) from discontinued operations before income taxes$(72) $457Income taxes on discontinued operations46 121Gain on sale of business before income taxes$5,197 $—Income tax expense/(benefit) on sale of business(138)(1) —Net earnings from discontinued operations$5,217 $336(1) The income tax benefit of the Beauty Brands divestiture represents the reversal of underlying deferred tax balances partially offset by current tax expense related to the transaction.The following is selected financial information included in cash flows from discontinued operations for the Beauty Brands: Beauty BrandsYears ended June 302017 2016NON-CASH OPERATING ITEMS   Depreciation and amortization$24 $106Deferred income tax benefit(649) —Gain on sale of businesses5,210 8Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges— 48Net increase in accrued taxes93 —CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES   Cash taxes paid$418 $—CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES   Capital expenditures$38 $114Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.66        The Procter & Gamble CompanyFollowing is selected financial information included in Net earnings from discontinued operations for the Batteries business:  Net Sales Earnings Before Impairment Charges and Income Taxes Impairment Charges Income Tax (Expense)/ Benefit Loss on Sale Before Income Taxes Income Tax (Expense)/ Benefit on Sale Net Earnings from Discontinued OperationsBatteries20161,517 266 (402) (45) (288) 710(1) 241(1) The income tax benefit of the Batteries divestiture primarily represents the reversal of underlying deferred tax balances.NOTE 14QUARTERLY RESULTS (UNAUDITED)Quarters Ended  Sep 30 Dec 31 Mar 31 Jun 30 Total YearNET SALES2017-2018 $16,653 $17,395 $16,281 $16,503 $66,832 2016-2017 16,518 16,856 15,605 16,079 65,058OPERATING INCOME2017-2018 3,735 4,003 3,296 2,677 13,711 2016-2017 3,771 3,875 3,360 2,949 13,955GROSS MARGIN2017-2018 50.6% 50.2% 48.8% 45.3% 48.7% 2016-2017 51.0% 50.8% 49.8% 48.4% 50.0%NET EARNINGS:           Net earnings from continuing operations2017-2018 $2,870 $2,561 $2,540 $1,890 $9,861 2016-2017 2,875 2,561 2,556 2,202 10,194Net earnings/(loss) from discontinued operations2017-2018 — — — — — 2016-2017 (118) 5,335 — — 5,217Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble2017-2018 2,853 2,495 2,511 1,891 9,750 2016-2017 2,714 7,875 2,522 2,215 15,326DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE: (1)           Earnings from continuing operations 2017-2018 $1.06 $0.93 $0.95 $0.72 $3.67 2016-2017 1.00 0.93 0.93 0.82 3.69Earnings/(loss) from discontinued operations 2017-2018 — — — — — 2016-2017 (0.04) 1.95 — — 1.90Net earnings2017-2018 1.06 0.93 0.95 0.72 3.67 2016-2017 0.96 2.88 0.93 0.82 5.59(1) Diluted net earnings per share is calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble.Item 9.

All options became immediately vested and exercisable on October 1, 2005 as a result of the merger.  After the merger, all outstanding options became options to purchase shares of The Procter & Gamble Company subject to an exchange ratio of .975 shares of P&G stock per share of Gillette stock.  Only employees previously employed by The Gillette Company prior to October 1, 2005 are eligible to receive grants under this plan.  The last grant of equity under this plan was on February 27, 2009.The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate employees of The Gillette Company and, until the effective date of the merger between The Gillette Company and The Procter & Gamble Company, non-employee members of the Gillette Board of Directors.  Under the plan, eligible participants are: (i) granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, (ii) granted stock appreciation rights and/or (iii) granted shares of the Company's common stock or restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents).
