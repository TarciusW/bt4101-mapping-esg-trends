About Us 

 

The idea behind gifting is simple; it is a way to communicate our heartfelt appreciation for the 

people we care about. As a leading hampers, flowers and gifts company, Noel Gifts International 

Ltd (“Noel Gifts”, “We”) sought out to bringing people closer by offering premium quality gifts 

collection for all occasions. We create new gift designs and packages throughout the year to cater 

to the gifting needs of our increasingly discerning customers. With the headquarters in Singapore, 

Noel Gifts has, in 1991, ventured abroad through franchising and is the first local gifts company 

to have done so. In 2008, Noel Gifts was listed on the SGX Mainboard. [102-01] [102-05] [102-04] [102-

02] [102-03]  

 

Operating  in the gifting industry, we understand the importance of integrating sustainability into 

all our operations. By doing so, we not only recognise our responsibility to the society, but also, 

ensure a social and environmentally responsible business model.  [102-16] [102-6] 

 

Last year, we took a more formal approach to show our commitment towards sustainability by 

publishing our inaugural sustainability report. We continue showcasing our commitment to 

sustainability in this report that outlines our sustainability data gathered over a 12-month period 

(the financial year from 01 July 2019 to 30 June 2019). Like last year, our sustainability data is 

only reported for our gifting businesses in Singapore. [102-50] [102-54] [102-52] 

 

Reporting Methodology 

 

The methodology used to gather and report sustainability data is in accordance with the Global 

Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core option. The report content is designed based on the 

principles outlined by GRI. Sustainability factors material to the company were identified last year 

by key stakeholders. These factors have been reviewed again based on current business strategy, 

market conditions and stakeholder concerns. The progress on these factors has been monitored 

and reported in this report.  [102-46] 

For this report, we have not sought for external assurance. However, we may seek to externally 

assure our future sustainability reports. We strive to be transparent and to provide regular 

opportunities for review of our report. For questions or to deliver feedback about this report, 

please contact sustainability@noel.com.sg. [102-56] [102-53]

Statement from the Group Managing Director 

Sustainable growth is fundamental to Noel Gifts’ business. This is a responsibility we carry towards 

our stakeholders to make a positive difference economically, socially, and environmentally. As a 

sustainable organisation, we place ourselves at a competitive advantage from other gifts company 

in Singapore and the region. Last year, we embarked on our inaugural sustainability report, where 

we identified and reported Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) impacts of our 

organisation. We are pleased to share with you our second Sustainability report for the financial 

year ended 30 June 2019. Through this report, we share our progress in managing these ESG 

impacts, to substantiate our continued commitment towards sustainability. 

 

One of our key priorities includes our responsibility towards our employees; safeguarding their 

interests, promoting equality, meeting their requirements, fostering their learning and 

development. Consequent to the growth of the company there was a 42% increase in the number 

of training hours in FY2019 as compared to FY2018. An average employee received 8.65 hours 

of trainings. Understanding the need for professional growth, we also provided performance 

appraisals and career reviews to more than 85% of all our employees in all job grades.  

 

In FY2019, we introduced the Parent-care Leave (PCL) benefits to all our employees. We are 

proud to report that while these benefits have been introduced to support elderly parents, 100% 

of our employees have returned to work after their leave ended and have continued to be part 

of our organisation.  

 

Customers are one of our key stakeholders and we consider it of utmost importance to safeguard 

their privacy and data. We did not receive any reports of substantial complaints on breaches in 

customer privacy and data loss in FY2019. We hope to ensure the continuation of our efforts in 

protecting our customers’ privacy. Where our product offerings are concerned, we endeavour to 

continue the use of fair and responsible marketing practices and comply with regulations and/or 

voluntary codes concerning all forms of marketing communication. 

 

Viewing sustainability as a continuous journey towards a more profitable business, we strive to 

drive our improvement work towards ambitions within our priority areas. We are committed to 

adding value to all our internal and external stakeholders by improving our business performance 

sustainably and reporting our year-on-year progress.

Sustainability at Noel Gifts 

 

We live by our vision of Bringing People Closer, Making Everyday Better.  

Noel Gifts is about building a business that recognises the needs of our customers and cares for 

our employees, the community, and the environment. For us, sustainability is about integrity. We 

want all our stakeholders to be confident in our brand, to know that we value our environment 

and our community while we are striving for excellence in our operations. [102-16] 

 

Managing Sustainability-related Risks 

 

Managing risks that arise in our operations through a precautionary approach is the first step 

towards embracing sustainable growth.  

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) is responsible for overseeing the processes for risk 

management. The Board, with assistance from the Management, ensures a sound system of 

internal controls, and determines the nature and extent of the significant risks. The Management 

is responsible to review the Company’s business and operational activities to identify areas of 

significant business risks as well as identify appropriate measures to control and mitigate these 

risks within the Company’s policies and strategies. [102-11] 

 

Sustainability in Supply Chain 

 

Our supply chain consists of multiple suppliers and vendors that supply the raw materials for our 

operations. Risks and opportunities arise in our supply chain around our supplier and vendor 

operations. We aim for our suppliers and vendors to enjoy good working conditions, benefits and 

opportunities that would resonate to provide a positive impact on the wider community. The 

General Manager of Supply Chain oversees the overall supply chain operations of the Group and 

ensures all these risks and opportunities are effectively managed. [102-9] [102-10] 

 

Organisational Structure and Sustainability Governance 

 

The Management team under the oversight of the Board, work together to manage sustainability 

matters in Noel Gifts. [102-18] 

 

External Charters and Principles 

 

Noel Gifts follows all relevant regulations under the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”) and all other 

applicable regulations.  

Where possible, the corporate governance practices at Noel Gifts are in line with the Code of 

Corporate Governance 2012 (the “2012 Code”). The Board and the Management ensure that Noel 

Gifts remain in compliance with other regulations, notices, circulars, and guidelines that may be 

released by regulators from time to time. [102-12] [102-13]

Stakeholder Engagement 

At Noel Gifts, we value the diverse views provided by our various stakeholder groups - including 

our employees, shareholders, investors, customers and regulators – on areas where we can 

improve our operations. Over the years, we have built a strong relationship with our stakeholders 

who have helped us to understand ways to identify sustainability issues within the company. We 

have undertaken a strategic approach to improve our relationship with our stakeholders by 

enabling continuous and effective modes of dialogues with them.  

The table below shows our relationship and interaction with stakeholders during the FY2019.

Materiality Assessment: Managing Risks and 

Opportunities 

In 2018, we conducted a stakeholder engagement and materiality assessment session to 

understand the concerns and expectations of our stakeholders. During this session, we mapped 

topics that are significant to our business and influence our operations, and we identified key 

topics prioritized for reporting. This year, we report our progress in managing these topics in our 

operations and the goals we have set for performance improvement. [102-47] 

The six topics that impact our business are given in the table below. These topics also hold 

significance to our stakeholders.

Building Our Workforce  

 

Management Approach 

 

We are only as strong as our employees.  

People play a pivotal role in the success of our company. It is our privilege to encourage and 

reward employees who showcase unique skills and talents. We seek to foster talent in the 

organisation with the goal of sustaining and building a workforce that contributes to our business 

success. We also consider it essential to provide equal opportunity to all our employees. Through 

a dynamic workforce, we can build our market presence and enhance our organisation’s human 

capital.  

Nurturing employee talent and skills has always been our focus. We conduct regular training and 

career development of our employees to equip them with the right skills and increase their work 

efficiency. This keeps our staff motivated to achieve greater professional success. 

In FY2019, Noel Gifts signed the Employers' Pledge of Fair Employment Practices under the 

Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP), to show our 

commitment towards building a workplace that respects and values our employees. The Tripartite 

Alliance between the Ministry of Manpower, the National Trades Union Congress and the 

Singapore National Employers Federation, shares a vision for Singapore to be one of the best 

places in the world to work.  

As part of this Alliance, we endeavour to recruit and select employees on the basis of merit, treat 

employees fairly and with respect, provide employees with equal opportunity to be considered 

for training and development based on strengths and needs to help them achieve their full 

potential. We also endeavour to reward employees fairly based on their ability, performance, 

contributions and experience, abide by laws and adapt to the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair 

Employment Practices. 

[103-1] [103-2] [103-3] 

 

Employment 

 

We source for talent that would accelerate our success. In FY2019, our hiring rate was 44%, 

where women hired were 178% more than the men. Our turnover rate was 56%, which is lower 

than the turnover rate recorded in FY2018.   

We ensure that we provide our employees with competitive wages. Our operations in Singapore 

are where more than 80% of our employees are located. A significant proportion of employees 

are compensated based on wages subject to the minimum wage rule.  

We invest in our employees to ensure they receive the benefits they deserve. Our full-time 

employees receive medical and healthcare benefits. They receive healthcare benefits and other 

care packages such as health screening and dental. They are also covered for Disability and 

Invalidity. In addition, to make our staff feel included and special, we provide them with gifts on 

special occasions. Our staff also receive discounts and credit for staff purchases.  


 

10 

Our employees are entitled to ‘Shared Parental Leave’ and ‘Paternity Leave’ as per the 

requirements of the Ministry of Manpower in Singapore. In FY2019, no employee took ‘Shared 

Parental Leave’ or ‘Paternity Leave’. However, in FY2019, we introduced Parent-care Leave (PCL) 

as additional benefits given to all our employees. This was in line with our commitment to support 

our employees to attend to their aged parents who have medical conditions. The PCL benefits 

supplement the existing leave entitlements. We had 31 employees who took PCL in FY2019. We 

are happy to announce that we noted a 100% return to work from all these employees after the 

leave ended. These employees have continued to be employed at Noel Gifts 12 months after their 

return to work. [401-1] [401-2] [401-3] [202-1] [202-2]

Training and Career Development 

 

In FY2019, we delivered a total of 1,203 hours of training for all our employees. This is about 

42% higher than the total hours of training delivered to our employees in FY2018. All employees 

received an average of 8.65 hours of trainings. Training programmes designed for employees 

were primarily to upgrade their skills and included internal training courses such as sales training, 

floral arrangements, product training, etc.  

We support the employment and re-employment of employees beyond their official retirement 

age. We endeavour to deploy such employees into suitable positions and provide retraining or re-

skilling if necessary under the transition assistance programs that aims to support employees who 

are retiring or who have been terminated. [404-1] [404-2]

Maintaining our Quality of Service 

 

Management Approach 

 

Our service quality reflects our commitment to our customers. We consider our duty to uphold 

the highest standard of customer data privacy protection. We conduct our business in compliance 

with all applicable data protection laws that govern the collection, use, disclosure and care of 

personal data. Where our product offerings are concerned, we use fair and responsible marketing 

practices to keep our customers well informed regarding the product before they make their 

purchase. Every year, we review our operations to improve our performance and identify areas 

of improvement, to provide the best of services to our customers. [103-1] [103-2] [103-3] 

 

Customer Privacy and Marketing and Labelling 

 

We are happy to report that in FY2019, there were no cases of substantiated complaints 

concerning breaches of customer privacy and loss of customer data reported. We also saw no 

incidents of non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary codes concerning product and 

service information and labelling, in the reporting period. We are not charged with any case of 

non-compliance to regulations and/or voluntary codes concerning marketing communication, 

including advertising, promotion and sponsorship either. [418-1] [417-2] [417-3]

Our Corporate Responsibility Activities  

 

NOEL GIFTS GIVES BACK BY SUPPORTING TRAFFICKING 

SURVIVORS IN SINGAPORE 

Dedicated to our Vision of Bringing People Closer, Making Every Day Better, Noel Gifts has always 

cared for the community, especially the underprivileged. Since the beginning of September 2018, 

we have been working closely with Hagar to engage the services of trafficking survivors in 

Singapore to help with the assembly of ornaments and accessories used in Noel Gifts’ daily floral 

arrangements. With this initiative in place, Noel Gifts hopes to empower the survivors and create 

opportunities within our means to help bring light to broken lives.  

Moving forward, Noel Gifts will continue to work with Hagar to bring forth similar meaningful 

projects for upcoming events such as Christmas. We encourage our stakeholders to join us in 

showing their support.  

ABOUT HAGAR  

 

Human trafficking affects every country in the world, including Singapore. A registered charity in 

Singapore and part of a global organisation in 9 countries, Hagar works closely with the 

government to provide restorative care and empowerment support to women and girls who have 

been trafficked to Singapore for sexual or labour exploitation. This support includes providing 

them with safe accommodation, trauma recovery, legal support, education, vocational skills

training and a chance to reintegrate into their families or communities. More information about 

Hagar can be found on their official web site: www.hagar.org.sg.

$832,000 RAISED FOR NOEL GIFTS – SLEC GALA DINNER  

Kind hearts converged at the Noel Gifts – St Luke’s ElderCare (SLEC) Gala Dinner with $832,000 

raised and donated as of 22nd October 2018. The meaningful event which was graced by Her 

Excellency, Madam President Halimah Yacob, took place on 19 October 2018 at Marina Mandarin 

Singapore, and hosted more than 400 guests which included companies, individuals, and partners 

from various agencies and ministries.  

In line with our Vision of Bringing People Closer, Making Every Day Better, Noel Gifts has 

also made a donation of $100,000 to help support the cause. The donation cheque was received 

by Mr Timothy Teo, Chairman of St Luke’s ElderCare. St Luke’s ElderCare (SLEC) is a Christian 

healthcare provider that currently operates 22 eldercare centres. Through this contribution, Noel 

Gifts hopes to support SLEC in creating a community of care, in line with SLEC’s Vision for 2030 

– “Forge a Community of Care”. Such initiatives could inspire more individuals and companies to 

step up and do their part for the society. The funds that were raised through this event will be 

used to support SLEC’s operational expenses, upscale innovation and technology, and sustain 

their efforts in caring for the seniors in the community.  

The dinner was the first-ever partnership gala event for both SLEC and Noel Gifts aimed at raising 

awareness about ageing issues alongside fundraising efforts.  

More information on Noel Gifts and St Luke’s ElderCare can be found on their respective websites
