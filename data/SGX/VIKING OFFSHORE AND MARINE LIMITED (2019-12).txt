MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

 

After conducting a materiality assessment involving internal stakeholders, taking into account 

related business risks and opportunities, and the current state of affairs of the Group, we have 

identified the ESG factors that are most material as economic performance, employment, 

governance and regulatory, as well as occupational health and safety. All these rank high in 

significance to stakeholders and to the Group’s business. 

 

 

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

 

Economic performance is very important to a company’s stakeholders, particularly its 

investors or owners, because this performance eventually provides them with a return on their 

investment. Other stakeholders, like the firm’s employees and the society at large, are also 

deemed to benefit from such performance, albeit less directly. 

 

The offshore and marine industry was showing signs of gradual recovery and increase in 

inquiries in 2019. This trend was disrupted by the global COVID-19 pandemic, and further 

exacerbated by the oil price volatility and plummeting demand. This has created one of the 

most volatile periods in history for the upstream oil and gas industry with unprecedented 

challenges. As with most economic sectors and businesses, the economic and industry 

outlook has turned weaker and future developments difficult to assess. To navigate this 

challenging climate, the Group will continue to monitor the situation closely and adjust its 

operating capacity in accordance with the fluid situation and when there is more clarity on the 

market development. 

 

As a company listed on the Catalist board of the SGX-ST, we publish a detailed annual report 

comprising our risk management, corporate governance, and financial performance. For 

detailed information, please refer the financial results announcements made by the Group on 

a quarterly basis and the Company’s Annual Report for FY2019 which will be published in 

June 2020. 

 

Target: 

The Group continues to focus its effort in maintaining viability of its offshore and marine 

business, completing the share placement agreement with the potential investors, and 

reaching a potential settlement or arrangement of the relevant liabilities with key creditors. The 

above actions will allow the Group to effectively exit the moratoria, and thereby deleverage 

the balance sheet and improve the financial capacity of the Group.  

 

 

EMPLOYMENT 

 

The Group is also committed to carry out its social responsibility at the workplace for 

employees, and recognises that it is important to provide a safe and conducive working 

environment for employees. In addition, employees are employed under fair and equitable 

terms, and in compliance with the applicable labour laws. Furthermore, employees are also 

given equal opportunities with regard to their career advancement.

Employee information of the Group as at 31 December 2019, together with prior year 

comparative, are as follows: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We treat all employees fairly, with respect and dignity, regardless of nationality, gender, age, 

race or religion. The hiring procedures are fair and non-discriminative. Staff are hired on the 

basis of merit, skills, experience or competency to perform the job. 

 

The Group ensures compliance with labour and employment laws, including working hours 

and believes in good work-life balance for our employees. 

 

All employees are expected to uphold and ensure that they do not engage in any interest that 

conflicts with any of the Company’s businesses. The code of work ethics is published in our 

Company’s Employee Handbook. 

 

Target:  

The Group aims to ensure all its employees comply with its Code of Conduct through: 

• 

adequate training and/or briefings to the employees on its conduct guidelines; and 

• 

effective investigation and corrective action on whistleblowing incidents. 

 

 

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

 

Health safety and environment (“HSE”) for our workforce has been a key focus throughout our 

growth as a company. It is not only a fundamental right for our workers to be able to work in a 

safe and healthy environment, but when our employees’ wellness is attained, our productivity 

increases, and we can provide the best for our customers. 






 

5 

 

 

Our HSE Policy, applies to all employees and contractors, and focuses on prevention and 

compliance. We conduct safety risk assessments at all levels and across all operating 

locations. 

 

We have a HSE Committee to oversee the promotion of safety culture and practices in the 

workplace. Led by a member of our Management, the HSE Committee includes 

representatives from each functional department. Monthly meetings are held to discuss HSE 

related matters, including reviews of changes in regulatory requirements, outcomes of monthly 

safety inspection, results from regular risk assessments and the necessary preventive 

measures. The information is then disseminated by the HSE Committee members to their 

peers during their respective department meetings. All our employees are represented by the 

joint management-worker HSE Committee. Additionally, news and directives relating to HSE 

matters communicated to all employees through emails and supervisor briefings.   

 

Our operations in Singapore have safety management systems in place. The certifications for 

bizSAFE STAR, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001:2007 are in place. 

 

Health and safety trainings on aspects such as risk assessment, fire safety, and first aid are 

provided for all staff according to their job requirements. Both workshop-based and field staffs 

are sent for relevant risk management training sessions throughout the year and are 

familiarised with the latest safety frameworks. Specific programmes are provided for high-risk 

site engineers, where they learn how to work safely at heights and in confined spaces. 

Relevant employees who are nominated as First-Aiders will be given CPR+AED training. In 

addition, we conduct health talks and activities for all our employees regularly. 

 

We follow Ministry of Manpower (MOM)’s Workplace Safety and Health Guidelines to manage 

safety and health of our employees in shipyards and ships. One significant hazard that our 

field service engineers at shipyard or on-board vessels may be exposed to is high noise level. 

To prevent noise-induced deafness (NID), all engineers are required to use appropriate 

personal protection equipment at work. All our new engineers are required to go through 

audiometric tests, which are followed-up annually to monitor hearing and detect any symptoms 

of NID. 

 

We had no fatalities in FY2019 (FY2018 – zero). 

 

Our Accident Severity Rate (ASR) and Accident Frequency Rate (AFR) was zero (FY2018 – 

8.5) and zero (FY2018 – 133.0) per million man hours worked in FY2019, respectively. This 

is an improvement as compared to the prior financial year and the Management will continue 

to focus and ensure the same safety vigilance going forward. 

 

Target:  

The Group targets to continue to stress the importance of workplace safety and aim to 

maintain AFR and ASR of zero in the upcoming years. 

 

 

GOVERNANCE AND REGULATORY 

 

The Group strives to comply with the best practices of good governance, guided by the 

Singapore Code of Corporate Governance 2018 (the “Code”), throughout its operations to 

safeguard the interests of all stakeholders. The Group recognises that good corporate 


 

6 

 

governance processes are essential for enhancing corporate sustainability. While the 

Company finalises its Annual Report for FY2019, the Group will continually be guided by the 

Code. 

 

• Risk Management 

 

An integral part of good corporate governance, a comprehensive risk management 

framework enables the Group to identify and manage risks in a systematic and consistent 

manner. In driving risk awareness, decision-making and business processes are put through 

prudent risk assessment. Fraud, corruption and economic value-added risks have been 

identified as material to ensure business sustainability. 

 

• Whistle Blowing Policy 

 

The Whistle Blowing Policy adopted by the Board serves to provide an effective mechanism 

for employees and other stakeholders of the Group to raise concerns regarding any illegal 

conduct or malpractice. The policy also allows such concerns to be raised without being 

subject to victimization, harassment or discriminatory treatment, and ensures that such 

concerns are properly channelled to the right party for further investigation. 

 

• Dealings in Securities 

 

The Group’s Code of Conduct includes guidelines to directors and employees in the Group, 

which sets out prohibitions against dealings in the Company’s securities (i) while in 

possession of material unpublished price-sensitive information; and (ii) before each 

announcement of the Group's financial results. Prior to each announcement of the Group’s 

financial results, an email would be sent out as reminder to all directors and employees of 

the Group to inform them of the duration of the trading black-out period. 

 

Target:  

The Group will continue to comply with the Catalist Rules and the Code.
