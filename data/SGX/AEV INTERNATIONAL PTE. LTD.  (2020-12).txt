About

the Theme

Aboitiz &amp; Company (ACO) was officially established 

as a company in 1920, but the historical roots of 

the Aboitiz Legacy are traced earlier to a Basque 

mariner who set sail from his coastal hometown 

of Lekeitio in the northern region of Spain. Paulino 

Aboitiz embarked on his journey through the Suez 

Canal to reach Philippine shores and arrived in 

Ormoc in the southern province of Leyte in 1870. 

Paulino ventured in the trading of abaca,

which, at that time, was the booming product for 

export. Hard work and ambition drove him

to become a well-established merchant, 

transporting and distributing abaca and other 

commodities to Cebu. He was supported by his 

son Ramon,who pushed for the purchase of the 

company’s first boat, the Picket, bought in 1907 for 

PHP7,500 at a government auction. This signaled 

the start of the Aboitiz shipping business. Ramon 

also oversaw the establishment of an office in 

Cebu, then already a bustling port town and central 

business district, which allowed them to diversify 

and expand their markets.  

The brothers’  efforts led to ACO’s incorporation in 

1920. Unfortunately, a few months later, World War 

I broke out. The market prices of abaca plummeted 

due to decreased demand. Business trading, in 

general, was in shambles. ACO teetered on the 

edge of bankruptcy, and Ramon was pushed by 

colleagues to declare bankruptcy in order to escape 

their debts and to save what was left. But Ramon 

resisted, and instead, borrowed money from former 

business associates and a few friends. It took many 

years to repay all the loans, but Ramon’s palabra

de honor lifted the company from near dissolution.

“The biggest fortune 

I have is my word and 

reputation. Money can be 

lost and can be recovered, 

but once your name and 

reputation are lost, one’s 

word is worthless, and one 

is truly finished.” 

Don Ramon Aboitiz

In the decades following ACO’s incorporation, 

the astute leader Ramon — and the presidents 

who succeeded him — involved the company in 

other interests. They moved from distributing 

abaca, copra, and other agricultural produce 

to selling chemicals, construction materials, 

industrial equipment, and car parts in the mid-

1900s. One of the widely-known investments 

of the Aboitiz Group was shipping, which was 

formally incorporated in 1952 through Aboitiz 

Shipping Corporation. It ventured into sea, land, 

and air travel, and pioneered containerization in 

the country. ACO also tapped into businesses that 

would complement its existing ones: sugar milling 

and plantations, electricity distribution, financial 

services, oxygen production, cold storage facilities, 

and wood preservation, among many others. 

In 1994, ACO publicly listed its holding and 

management company Aboitiz Equity Ventures 

Inc. (AEV) at the Philippine Stock Exchange. In 

2007, Aboitiz Power Corporation also went public.  

In 2010, AEV divested its shipping business and 

focused on its other core businesses. Today, 

the Aboitiz Group continues to evolve, with our 

time-honored core values of Integrity, Teamwork, 

Innovation, and Responsibility continuing to 

compel us to seek ways to translate economic 

development into the greater good, resonating 

in actions and decisions to help uplift the lives of 

the people we serve. What started as Paulino’s 

small family business in Leyte is now a major 

conglomerate expanding its footprint across 

Southeast Asia.

ACO marked its 100th year as a corporation in 

2020, and we look back to reflect and appreciate 

the learnings that the previous generations of 

A-people have put forth to bring us to where 

we are today. As we energize communities, 

fulfill the dreams of many, connect ideas, design 

experiences, or take on evolving challenges, 

our inclusive understanding of societal needs 

sustains our purpose and promise to drive change 

for a better world by advancing business and 

communities. We look back with fondness on our 

small-town beginnings in the Visayas while making 

major strides towards our shared future for our 

country and region. 

Moving on to the next hundred years,

we will continue to think long-term and brace

for new beginnings, beyond borders, and 

transcending generations.

Materiality, as defined by the GRI reporting 

framework, includes topics and disclosures 

that reflect the Group’s significant economic,

decisions of our stakeholders.

Our process involved an internal analysis of the 

importance of a broad list of sustainability issues 

related to our core businesses of power, banking and 

financial services, food, infrastructure, land, and

our corporate foundation. At the parent company 

level, we integrated the common material issues

that are within the medium-term horizon of our 

reporting parameters.

We used our stakeholder dialogues and company-

wide feedback channels to inform the selection 

of these material issues, which were discussed 

and approved by the Aboitiz Group Management 

Committee as part of the focus areas of our Aboitiz 

Sustainability Framework.

Restatements and Improvements

We gathered data for this report using the robust 

systems and tools currently in place among our 

participating business units. We remain focused on 

the continuous improvement of our data collection 

and analysis processes. Notes on the restatements of 

key performance indicators are found in the appendix 

section and in pages where they appear.

are delivering on our brand promise of advancing

business and communities (ABC). We will regularly 

report on our performance through stories told by 

our stakeholders, with two special topics featured for

Dear Fellow Stakeholders,

We send you all our warmest greetings.

The year has passed, and we are back to talk to you, our fellow stakeholders, to 

tell you our story for the quirky year that is behind us. More importantly, we will 

share with you our best assessment of the year and years to come.

The timely adaptation to change, as a broad philosophical guide for both our 

thinking and behavior, are ingredients of the culture we are enriching in everything 

we do, everywhere and always. Adaptation could not have been underlined 

and placed in bold letters more than by COVID-19. We still see unintended 

consequences as our most serious threat. COVID-19 reminded us vividly. 

The continuous challenge we mentioned to you last year of getting all our 

fundamentals right as we innovate precisely for the timely adaptation to change is 

generally being met. The highlight is that our plants are running better. COVID-19, 

on the other hand, has delayed the entrance into the operation of our single 

largest investment in a very long time and maybe in our history, our GN Power 

Dinginin. That is another fundamental that we will get right this year. 

COVID-19 will force all of us to operate smarter disruptively and digitally. We were 

a little ahead of the game here and this enabled us to adapt very quickly. As part 

of our digital transformation strategy very early on, we dedicated a significant 

amount of energy and resources into preparing our team for remote working 

alongside vigilance to cybersecurity risks. These became top concerns in the 

business world last year but Aboitiz has already put this into practice, which has

really paid off given our seamless experience in 

shifting our work setup.

Your Boards also met more frequently than 

usual and took in weekly virtual meetings with 

the various executive committees to ensure 

nothing was left to chance under an extremely 

volatile situation. For a few months, we devoted 

much discussion on preparing for the worst by 

monitoring, with management, more of the 

company more often than usual. We are back to 

our normal governance schedule but must take 

the opportunity to applaud the government, 

particularly Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas whose 

quick action ensured the banking system 

remained liquid and open to lending.

Looking back, our first imperative was the 

safety of our people. Your management team, 

particularly at HR, did what it needed to do to 

ensure the safety of our team members and 

their families as we moved into working from 

wherever. Limitations and constraints enhanced 

the challenge that we met but we kept a holistic 

approach to protect our people physically, 

emotionally, and mentally. 

our communities and all our stakeholders through 

this health crisis.

Pressure and difficulty are wonderful wake-

up calls. COVID-19 sent up flares in numerous 

areas from small matters like DocuSign — that 

we should have executed earlier — to, more 

seriously, innovative digital solutions to ensure 

continued availability of our services and the 

acceleration of more sophisticated cybersecurity 

controls.

Fortunately, while some of our businesses were 

affected by the economic slow down caused 

by the community quarantine, our businesses 

proved resilient with most back to pre-pandemic 

levels. We do not have businesses that will 

take a long time to come back to where they 

were, if they ever do. We refer to the tourism, 

hospitality, and transportation businesses that 

are particularly difficult. 

Overall, all sectors are working with profits and 

positive cash flows for an ever firmer balance 

As the nationwide lockdown was imposed, we 

aimed to ensure peace of mind among all team 

members by releasing their mid-year pay and 

Christmas bonuses ahead of schedule. Our 

non-stop information campaign tackled proper 

health and safety protocols, virtual updates from 

our technical working group, consultations with 

experts, to name a few — all to help the Group 

better understand the dynamics of COVID-19. 

Aboitiz Academy used the time to train and 

educate. Vaccination is high on our agenda for 

both protection and evolution to a newer, better, 

and smarter way of doing things with caution 

yet more freedom. 

The next imperative was to help our 

communities through direct interventions 

and in cooperation with the government and 

other members of the private sector as the 

surprise micro-beast that attacked us was one 

that needed all hands on deck.  The disasters 

of typhoons in the past prepared the private 

sector to react and help, together with the 

government. We invite you to read through the 

COVID-19 section of this report, which provides 

details on our groupwide initiatives to support 

sheet. Our president will give you more 

details in his report. The system to monitor 

all operations tighter and more frequently 

were set up at the governance and 

management levels. We are lightening the 

load of the center to evolve into higher levels 

of openness, agility, and innovation.

The vaccine is upon us and igniting optimism 

but it is not yet here. Prudence tells us to 

continue on red alert and never leave it so 

we are ready for the next surprise.  

Aboitiz, as a corporation, enters its second 

century in a wake-up call year. As a family 

enterprise, we enter our third century in 

that same wake-up call year. We were awake 

in many areas but in siesta mode in others. 

COVID-19 has woken us up completely. 

We will attend to tighter attention to the 

fundamentals of our business with the 

concern of accelerated change and disruption 

firmly tattooed on our foreheads.

As we have for the last 100 years, our purpose is to 

advance business and communities. We continue to do 

so as we have for a very long time. Being contributing 

neighbors is the right thing to do and it is through our 

business — our products and services — where we can 

make the biggest positive impact on our stakeholders.

just put up more poles to serve more people, 

we also set up free street lights, the city’s 

911 emergency service, the Aboitiz Cleanergy 

Park for the pawikan, and, in December 2020, 

launched BEST Bus, its first free electric bus 

service in the central business district. Go to 

YouTube and listen to the public — Davao BEST 

Bus will connect you to what the public says. In 

banking and financial services, we are leveraging 

digital technology to elevate lives by promoting 

greater financial inclusion. We are likewise 

helping to ensure food security and availability, 

for example, by training displaced Maranao 

yellow corn farmers in entrepreneurship and by 

linking them to potential buyers. Service to our 

communities and our country goes hand in hand 

with better business — it always has.

We have always put people first because success 

is about better people serving our customers in 

better and smarter ways. Good returns follow 

happy and returning customers. Aboitiz has 

always acted understanding the above clearly. 

It is probably the single most important reason 

that we have, as a family, been in business all 

over these islands way before we began life as a 

corporation. COVID-19 reminded us against any 

talent management complacency.

There is a fear that our economy will take longer 

than most to recover. We are hoping that the 

unmeasured resilience of our people will make 

up for the deficit of traditional international 

measures. We are a unique people that have 

been isolated and insulated in our own little part 

of Southeast Asia. 

We may not be the best at the pro-active but we 

are quite good at the reactive. We have faith in 

the capacity of our people to work together in 

crisis even some of our more formal institutions 

fail.  Our overseas workers, the heroes of our 

economy are all firmly there — everywhere 

they are first to hire and last to fire.  Some have 

come back, like the cruise ship farers, but far 

more are still out there helping their families 

and our economy. We are a spiritual culture 

that helps each other. That matters in ways few 

international institutions can measure. We have 

surprised ourselves before. We will surprise 

ourselves again.

Not everything that counts, can be counted. we 

have shown the world this often.

We are optimistic that the economy will recover 

and reach pre-pandemic levels. Whether that 

recovery comes this year, the next, or the one 

after — we are ready! One thing we are positive 

about is we will come out of this crisis stronger 

as a business and as a country.

Our imperatives to increase the efficiencies of 

our plants, particularly our coal plants, continue. 

We know that a thermal shift from coal to gas 

is in front of us. We face the challenge to build 

our renewable portfolio because it is the right 

thing to do for our country and for the long-term 

sustainability of our business.

Most importantly, increased attention is being 

given to what is beyond the balance sheet 

— the value produced by our intangibles, 

particularly our culture. Too much attention 

was given by the world, and us by osmosis, 

to compliance and process. While this is 

important, there is much to get done and we 

are re-balancing how we invest our time and 

energy into getting things done better and 

smarter to remain super competitive.

We are on red alert today. The main ‘beyond the 

balance sheet’ initiative we have learned and 

are ingraining into our DNA is that red alert is 

the “new normal”. We know a new surprise is 

coming. In what form and from where we are 

not sure, but we do know it is in its bacterial 

stage. Complacency and overconfidence are our 

enemy.

As we have for the last 100 years, our purpose 

is to advance business and communities.  We 

continue to do so as we have for a very long 

time. Being contributing neighbors is the right 

thing to do and it is through our business — our 

products and services — where we can make the 

biggest positive impact on our stakeholders. 

We are not going to be a company that rides 

on to a fad of having a purpose. We had this 

purpose since we can remember. Ramon Aboitiz 

built the Cebu Boys’ Town to take care of and 

train orphans. We modernized the shipping 

business with our SuperFerries. We brought in

Sabin M. Aboitiz

Dear Fellow Stakeholders,

After celebrating our 100th founding anniversary in 2020, the Aboitiz Group 

begins this next chapter of our history in a world that is still counting the cost of 

the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

As Endika and Montxu mentioned, the Group’s senior leaders held more meetings 

than usual in the past year to make sure we were on the right track amid the 

multifaceted and volatile challenges of the situation. It was clear early on that 

we needed to put aside many pre-planned projects, cut down 2020 CAPEX, and 

conserve cash to protect the goose that is Aboitiz. In trying to see around corners, 

our focus has been to make decisions that translate to equitable and values-driven 

action while keeping optimism intact on the path towards recovery.

Aboitiz Group’s Pandemic Response

In January 2020, Aboitiz Foundation was in the midst of leading our Taal relief 

operations when we began to keep a close eye on news coming out of Wuhan in 

Central China. By the time the World Health Organization had given a name to 

the virus, our technical working group had already rolled out minimum health 

standards, preventive measures, travel advisories, and procedures for handling 

cases. Our business continuity plans — designed to further minimize disruption 

— were set in motion as the entire country went into enhanced community 

quarantine or ECQ. 

We took full advantage of the digital route where 

it made better sense to do so. All throughout, our 

priority was to ensure the well-being of our team 

members and that our strategic business units 

(SBUs) continued to operate at optimal levels, 

especially as our stakeholders relied on the 

essential services we provide. 

102-14

One of the first things we did was implement 

groupwide work-from-home arrangements and 

stay-in shifts at our critical infrastructures. We 

took full advantage of the digital route where 

it made better sense to do so. All throughout, 

our priority was to ensure the well-being of our 

team members and that our strategic business 

units (SBUs) continued to operate at optimal 

levels, especially as our stakeholders relied on 

the essential services we provide. 

We were also careful not to confine our 

response to a one-size-fits-all approach because 

our own frontliners have varying needs and 

situations. For example, teams needing to 

remain at the plants were provided full board 

and lodging for the entire stay while those who 

needed to report to the corporate offices had 

free shuttle transportation to limit their 

public contact. 

To ensure that all health and safety protocols 

and government guidelines were easily 

accessible, we created a dedicated COVID-19 

microsite and a ‘Return To Work Playbook’, both 

regularly updated with relevant information that 

everyone must know and be able to understand. 

As #OneAboitiz, we rolled out financial 

assistance schemes, particularly in our host 

communities. By the end of 2020, we have 

contributed in value worth PHP2.2 billion to the 

national pandemic response under a sustained 

campaign to help address the urgent needs of 

frontliners and affected communities, especially 

in Cebu City and Davao City. 

Financial Highlights Review

For the full-year 2020, Aboitiz Equity Ventures 

(AEV) posted a net income of PHP15.4billion, 

a 30 % decrease from PHP22.0 billion in 2019. 

Power accounted for the largest share of the 

total income contribution from AEV’s SBUs. 

It turned in 52% , followed by the Banking 

and Financial Services, which increased its 

contribution to 32%. Our Food SBU contributed 

12% while the remainder was covered by 

Infrastructure and Land SBUs 

with 2% each. 

Aboitiz Power Corporation’s (AboitizPower) net 

income contribution decreased by 27% year-on-

year (YoY) to PHP9.7 billion from the previous 

year’s PHP13.3 billion. 

Union Bank of the Philippines’ (UnionBank) 

income contribution for 2020 dipped to PHP5.9 

billion from PHP7.2 billion in 2019. The decline 

was due to higher provisions for loan losses in 

2020. 

AEV’s non-listed food subsidiaries reported an 

income contribution of PHP2.2 billion for 2020, 

up from PHP1.6 billion in 2019. Strong gains 

from the Food Group’s overseas units were able 

to offset local declines. 

Republic Cement &amp; Building Materials posted an 

income contribution to AEV of PHP590 million, a 

4% decrease from the PHP612 million recorded in 

2019. This was due to lower demand for cement 

due to the decline in construction activities in 

2020, particularly during the enforcement of 

COVID-related community quarantines.

AboitizLand and its subsidiaries reported a 

consolidated net income of PHP338 million 

in 2020, 64% lower than the PHP943 million 

recorded in 2019. The decrease was brought 

about by fair valuation gains on investment 

properties recognized in 2019.

We provide more information on these and a 

review of each SBU’s operations in the Results of 

Operations sections of this report.







AEV President &amp; CEO Sabin Aboitiz and senior leaders visited SBU facilities to check in with frontliners and see firsthand 

how they are managing conditions on the ground.

As #OneAboitiz, we rolled out financial 

assistance schemes, particularly in our host 

communities. By the end of 2020, we have 

contributed in value worth PHP2.2 billion to the 

national pandemic response under a sustained 

campaign to help address the urgent needs of 

frontliners and affected communities, especially 

in Cebu City and Davao City.

Instilling Innovation and Becoming a

Data-Driven Organization 

As expected, our 2020 results took a hit due, 

more or less, to the same factors that plagued 

our economy but we do not allow ourselves 

to be discouraged by this. Instead, we need 

to continue learning from this big room for 

improvement that continues to expand before 

us. This is why, for the second year in a row, 

Innovation is our “Value of the Year’’. We 

need to instill this in our teams but achieving 

that requires consistency and clarity over an 

extended period of time. It is a slow-and-steady 

approach, something we truly need to devote 

time and energy to until it eventually becomes 

second nature to our everyday thought process. 

This becomes even more vital as we work to 

achieve our strategic growth objectives in the 

post-COVID world.

It is said that innovation is often borne out of 

disruption but, more and more, we are seeing 

innovation coming from a sense of urgency. 

Not surprisingly, the information age reveals 

the glaring disconnect between the speed of 

innovation in improving the quality of life and 

the almost crippling inability of companies, 

leaders in business, to adapt them. Obviously, 

change needs to start with us. 

At the core, whatever and however we 

innovate through our products and services 

should lead to creating a positive impact 

on our communities. By embracing Data 

Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI), we 

open up to new and bigger opportunities to 

accelerate our productivity, drive business 

value, and generate new revenue streams. 

In 2021, we further harness its full potential 

with the launch of Aboitiz Data Innovation, 

our new subsidiary under AEV International 

that will consolidate the #OneAboitiz DSAI 

operating model across the Group. This 

company functions as our key enabler of data 

strategy through its dual role as a service 

provider and governance center to support 

the organization.

We envision DSAI to be a permanent aspect 

of each SBU’s business landscape, including 

the development and support of our business 

models and decision-making capabilities. 

Ultimately, it will be instrumental towards 

achieving our environmental, social, and 

corporate governance (ESG) goals. 

Organizational Resilience

Many aspects of our organizational practice have 

been much help in navigating the pandemic but 

at the center of our story are our A-People. The 

silver lining in 2020 is our team members pulling 

us through with unparalleled work ethic, agility, 

and commitment to our stakeholders. They 

went above and beyond in the past year and it 

is because of their resilience that we are able to 

face the future with hope and optimism. Truly, 

they are the lifeblood of our organization and 

my confidence rests completely in them. 

One stellar example we will not get tired 

of repeating is how our experience moving 

operations from a physical environment to the 

cloud was like flipping a switch. 

Prior to the pandemic, we were already either 

telecommuting or working from home and had 

corresponding guidelines and tools in place to 

support its success. This allowed us to continue 

to engage with our stakeholders despite the 

constricting effects of the initial lockdown. 

Last year, we were among a few publicly listed 

companies in the Philippines that held their 

annual stockholders’ meetings on time and on a 

virtual platform.

We also used digital channels in promoting 

physical and mental wellness for our team 

members through 24x7 access to teleconsult 

services, virtual engagement activities, HR pulse 

checks, and online learning, which had a surge 

in uptake throughout last year. In 2021, we have 

added data science, artificial intelligence, 







Though we rely on the government to lead us in finding effective solutions that improve people’s lives, it is also imperative 

for businesses to do our part in helping alleviate the situation and contribute to the global sustainability goals.

and machine learning to our learning and 

development curriculum with the aim of 

creating awareness of data-driven possibilities as 

part of equipping our people with the skills they 

need to thrive in the fourth industrial revolution.

 

It’s true that early digitalization has been a 

tremendous help to our business continuity in 

the COVID-19 era but we must emphasize that it 

was, and still is, the passion within our A-People 

to continuously explore and experiment in new 

ways of working that sustains us. There is no 

sophisticated formula behind it either. To an

while ensuring long-term value creation,

In all our business units, we monitor the ESG 

concerns of our stakeholders and provide 

guidance on corporate governance, business 

process improvements, and innovative solutions. 

We ensure that environmental concerns 

such as GHG emissions are managed and 

minimized, waste generation reduced, and the 

potential recovery of a circular economy and 

responsible water consumption maximized. 

We also recognize the equal rights of our team 

members to a safe working environment and 

opportunities for learning and development. 

The Group advances communities’ concerns by 

implementing strategies and programs that help 

contribute to the United Nations Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs).

Our Group’s 10-year ESG Roadmap is part of 

our sustainability impact journey. AEV and 

AboitizPower achieved significant improvements 

in their S&amp;P Global Corporate Sustainability 

Assessment in 2020; UnionBank had its maiden 

assessment last year, ranking well among local 

peers. As we account for our impacts on our 

stakeholders, we aim to further improve our 

ESG performance for long-term value creation 

and aspire for greater contribution to the global 

sustainability goals. 

In 2020, the Aboitiz Group, through AEV, was 

the first Philippine company to signify support 

for the  Task Force on Climate-Related Financial 

Disclosures (TCFD). As a TCFD supporter, we 

join over 1,700 international organizations in 77

11 (sustainable communities), and SDG 9 

(development of innovative infrastructure) while 

at the same time providing decent work (SDG 8) 

and managing impacts to climate change (SDG 

13), life below water (SDG 4), and life on land

to lead us in finding effective solutions to the 

current crisis, it is also imperative for businesses 

to do their part in helping alleviate the situation 

and contribute to the global sustainability goals.

Moreover, as a member of the APEC Business 

Advisory Council, we lead and participate in 

meaningful discussions with global economies 

to enable policy recommendations for regional 

inclusive development, economic recovery, 

sustainability, and digital transformation.

Moving Forward in the New

and Better Normal

Aboitiz &amp; Company’s 100th anniversary reminds 

us that the Group was built and strengthened 

over the course of a century, weathering 

many adversities and overcoming challenges. 

Our history shows that after every crisis, 

we survive, build back stronger, and return 

to stability, an experience that continues to 

inspire us to persevere. 

The Aboitiz Group and other private 

companies signed a partnership with 

the national government to bring in the 

COVID-19 vaccine. Half of these vaccines will 

be for the government’s identified priority 

sectors, and the other half is for the use of 

private companies whose employees are 

economic frontliners. We will align our own 

internal vaccine roll-out plan with that of the 

government, and based on their guidelines, we 

will carefully plan out an efficient and effective 

deployment process.

For 2021, together with our partners, AEV has 

allotted PHP48 billion in capital expenditure. 

This is 69% higher than the PHP29 billion 

used in 2020. Of this amount, PHP23 billion 

was earmarked by our Power SBU for the 

completion of GNPower Dinginin as well as the 

battery energy storage projects. In the same 

manner, our Infrastructure arm set aside most 

of the PHP15 billion it had budgeted for the 

construction of its water businesses and its 

foray into the tower and airport businesses. 

The Food Group is expecting to utilize PHP4 

billion mainly for feedmill expansion. Rounding 

out the balance are the provisions of the 

other SBUs: the Banking group will sustain 

its investment efforts in its digital and branch 

transformation endeavors while our Land 

business has allocated capital expenditure for 

the completion of its residential projects.

AEV and AboitizPower achieved significant 

improvements in their S&amp;P Global Corporate 

Sustainability Assessment in 2020; UnionBank 

had its maiden assessment last year, ranking well 

among local peers. As we account for our impacts 

on our stakeholders, we aim to further improve 

our ESG performance for long-term value creation 

and aspire for greater contribution to the global 

sustainability goals.

Sabin M. Aboitiz

President and Chief Executive Officer

Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc.

We have also set our plans to achieve our 

10-year EBITDA targets for our SBUs. For 

AboitizPower, our growth strategy for the 

next 10 years is to significantly expand our 

renewables portfolio with a target 50-50 

renewable-to-thermal energy mix. UnionBank 

will continue to leverage its successful 

digital transformation strategy and pursue 

customer acquisition and engagement 

initiatives via digital channels and platforms 

in response to the increased shift in customer 

behavior. The Food Group will focus on fast-

growing segments like aqua and attractive 

geographies in the ASEAN region where there 

is a captive and competitive market. Aboitiz 

InfraCapital is optimistic about providing 

better infrastructure and facilities particularly 

in the water, digital, and mobility sectors. 

The integration of AboitizLand’s Industrial 

&amp; Commercial Business Unit supports our 

vision to further scale the growth of our 

industrial anchored-Integrated Economic 

Center project. It will likewise increase 

efforts in the digital space to convert sales 

and introduce more competitive payment 

terms to attract a broader market. 

Of course, AEV will continue to support 

all the SBUs in these growth initiatives 

mentioned and beyond, supported 

by a strong ESG program to help us 

systematically build strength and 

capabilities that, In turn, will help us 

achieve our aspirations.







Our history shows that after every crisis, we survive, build back stronger, and return to stability, an experience that continues to inspire 

us to persevere in creating a positive impact on our communities.

CFOs’

Message

Manuel 

Lozano

Liza Luv

Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc.

Aboitiz Power Corporation







Achieving harmony between sustainability and economic 

prosperity has been ingrained in the way we do things in Aboitiz. 

In the Office of the CFO, we strive to take part in driving the 

company’s growth by making sure there is ample support for the 

company’s aspirations here and abroad while aiming to align 

business activities with best practices.

As the organization sets its sights on the next 100 years, we have 

been tasked to safeguard our course in the context of the ESG risks 

and opportunities that may arise as we navigate our way forward.

Dear Fellow Stakeholders,

If we were to pick one learning from last year (and there were many), it is the 

timelessness of Louie Pasteur’s observation that “fortune favors the prepared 

mind”. While he had conjured this thought from a different perspective, it lends 

itself to a broader application.

What existing mindsets helped us cope from the disruption caused by the 

pandemic? Four mindsets appear to be: (1) Risk management (“It’s everyone’s 

job, regardless of function,” our risk managers often say); (2) Health and safety 

(fundamentally a way of life, AP achieved a 0.43 injury rate for every 1 million 

manhours worked in 2020, an exceptional improvement of 69% from its 2015 

level when the 1AP Safety Culture program was launched); (3) Innovation (which 

drove larger scale experimentation on today’s technologies as early as 2016); and 

(4) Corporate social responsibility (which planted the seeds of the ESG roadmap 

we have today).

Risk management is run enterprise-wide and strong business continuity plans are 

in place across the organization. Financial risk management is under the purview 

of the Office of the CFO. Last year, your finance team was focused on ensuring 

that your company had sufficient cash to sustain its operations and commitments 

despite a prolonged lockdown. This entailed cost cutting across our operating and 

capital budgets, constantly revisiting our assumptions, increasing the frequency 

of our reforecasting, and, most importantly, creative supplier and customer 

engagement. We also secured access to cash and made sure we had lines to tap 

should needs arise.

Capital Raising &amp; Balance Sheet

Our most significant cost cut was in our capital 

expenditure. We cut about a third of our original 

budget, but with careful consideration for the 

impact it might have on our future growth. 

To fund the remaining projects, we were able 

to leverage on our strong balance sheet,  the 

unwavering support of our partner banks, and 

our century old reputation built on our founder’s 

timeless story of paying back all his debts 

despite great odds.

A number of major financing transactions were 

completed in 2020.

January saw the completion of Aboitiz Equity 

Ventures Inc.’s (AEV or Aboitiz Equity Ventures) 

US$400 million maiden foreign denominated 

bond issuance, the first out of Asia for 2020.  

Soon after that, however, the pandemic 

escalated, and the quarantines began. And while 

the markets were tumultuous for the remainder 

of the year, we found ourselves steadily able to 

pursue and complete the fundraising initiatives 

we had planned even pre-pandemic.  Aboitiz 

Power Corporation (AP or AboitizPower) issued 

the P9.6 billion bond remaining on its shelf 

registration with the SEC in July, one of the first 

two bonds filed and issued during the lockdown.  

AEV also tapped the market in November for 

P7.5 Bln, completing the refinancing program 

for its bond maturity.  Together with these bond 

issuances, we tapped the banks for parent-level 

financing as well as project-level financing and 

refinancing for other members of the group, 

such as Hedcor Bukidnon, Inc., and Aboitiz 

Energy Solutions, Inc.

As a result, AboitizPower’s consolidated net 

debt-to-equity ratio at year end was at 1.4x, 

unchanged from the previous year’s ratio of 

1.4x.  For AEV, its consolidated net-debt-to-

equity at year end 2020 was at 1.1x, compared 

to the previous year’s ratio of 1.2x.  Our 

overall consolidated debt maturity profile 

remained within the parameters set by the 

companies to mitigate liquidity and refinancing 

risk. Furthermore, as a result of our financial 

planning, our balance sheets continue to 

be healthy, and our capacity to raise money 

through the debt markets, strong.

Financial Performance

A strong innovation mindset planted the 

seeds of digital transformation early on in our 

organization. The resulting digital infrastructure 

allowed us to continue operations and deliver on 

our stakeholder commitments. 

Office, branch, and plant operations across 

the portfolio were run through combinations 

of work shifts, remote via computers, skeletal 

workforces, work-from-home, and various 

flexible work arrangements, while observing 

COVID health protocols. Throughout all this, our 

first instinct was to protect the health and safety 

of our team members. Video-conferencing, 

being a part of our work arsenal for years up 

to the board level, became the main mode of 

communication, including for engaging our team 

members. Our investments in digital initiatives 

paid off. Your company was one of the very 

few who were able to immediately shift the 

processing of transactions to a purely remote 

environment from the very first day of the 

community quarantines. A lot evolved along the 

way, but we were ready from day one.

Now more than ever, our country needed our 

energy, financial instruments, food, housing, and 

water to make it through the difficult times. We 

were challenged, we rose to the occasion, and 

thrived.

In 2020, Aboitiz Equity Ventures’ consolidated 

EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, 

depreciation and amortization) dipped by 4% 

year-on-year (YoY) to PHP57.7 billion. This 

was primarily due to the challenges that the 

group faced resulting from the COVID-19 

pandemic. Beneficial EBITDA, which represents 

AEV’s proportional share of the EBITDAs of 

the companies it has investments in, was 3% 

lower than the previous year at PHP49.2 billion. 

Accounting for interest, tax and depreciation 

expenses, consolidated core net income 

amounted to PHP15.9 billion, 26% lower than 

last year. This core income resulted in an 

earnings per share of PHP2.83.

During the year, AEV recognized non-recurring 

losses, which brought net income to PHP15.4 

billion, or 30% lower YoY. This resulted in a 

return on shareholders’ equity of 9%.

Power continued to account for the largest share 

in earnings contributions to AEV at 52%. The 

financial services and food SBUs contributed 

32% and 12%, respectively, while contributions 

from the infrastructure and real estate SBUs 

stood at 2% and 2%, respectively.

Upon the conclusion of 2020, AEV’s consolidated 

cash balance stood at PHP66.9 billion. This 

leaves the organization with sufficient liquidity 

to sustain prolonged community quarantines.

In March 2021, the AEV Board approved a cash 

dividend of PHP0.91 per share. This accounted 

for 33% of 2020’s consolidated net income and 

resulted in a dividend yield of 2.1%.

Meanwhile, AboitizPower’s recorded 

consolidated EBITDA amounted to PHP44.7 

billion, 1% lower YoY. This was due to AP 

achieving its target availability for 2020, which 

offset the reduction in demand resulting from 

the COVID-related community quarantines. 

Beneficial EBITDA was 1% higher than last year 

at PHP43.5 billion. The income tax holidays of 

several AP business units expired in 2020; taking 

into account interest, tax and depreciation 

expenses, consolidated core net income 

amounted to PHP12.5 billion, or 25% lower than 

In 2021, we will continue to explore new insurance 

markets to lessen placement difficulty, study the 

viability of non-traditional risk transfer programs 

to mitigate identified risks, and optimize our 

captive participation to manage the increase in 

risk transfer costs.

the previous year. This core income translated to 

an earnings per share of PHP1.70.

In the same year, AboitizPower recognized non-

recurring gains from the revaluation of dollar-

denominated debts. AboitizPower recorded a 

net income of PHP12.6 billion, 27% lower than 

the previous year.

In March 2021, the AboitizPower Board 

approved a cash dividend of PHP0.85 per 

share. This was 50% of the company’s  2020 

consolidated net income and resulted in a 

dividend yield of 3.4%

Stakeholder Commitments

Not only did our digital infrastructure allow us to 

continue operating, it helped us deliver on our 

stakeholder commitments.

Last year, our award winning analysts’ briefings 

operated on full remote on schedule, with no 

disruption for its audiences which has had the 

virtual option since 2016. Last year too, our 

Virtual Annual Stockholders Meeting, a first for 

us, was one of the few stockholders meetings to 

be conducted on schedule among publicly listed 

companies in the Philippines. We also held our 

first ever Virtual Asset Tours last year, where 

audiences were able to see first hand the day-

to-day operations of the various Aboitiz business 

units. Across the group, we used our digital 

platforms to continue to engage our stakeholders 

- from our team members to our customers.

While too many to mention, and it will likewise 

be mentioned in other sections of this report, 

our finance teams worked extra hours to make 

sure we provided the various financial assistance 

needed by our team members, suppliers, 

customers, and communities.

Despite the pressing issues, we also managed 

to allocate time on projects to help promote 

the long-term investability of your company. 

Here are updates on the three commitments we 

mentioned in our message last year:

• To improve our ESG ratings and be 

investment grade over the medium to long 

term - As mentioned in our CEO’s message 

as well in the AboitizPower segment 

of this report, we achieved significant 

improvements in our SAM Corporate 

Sustainability Assessment results percentile 

rankings for both AEV and AP; while 

UnionBank has been assessed for the very 

first time;

• To explore how we can adopt the 

recommendations of the Task Force on 

Climate Related Financial Disclosures 

(TCFD) over the next three years within the 

context of our overall strategy - With the 

help of MSCI, we have done a first run of 

our data sets and still carefully vetting the 

methodologies of this very complex report;

• To refresh our assessment of material 

sustainability issues, their supporting 

programs and metrics; and extend our 

targets to 10-years, which includes 

our plan to achieve a 50/50 thermal/

renewable mix by the end of the decade 

- We commenced our re-assessment last 

year and target completion in 2021. In 

parallel, work continues on developing and 

communicating our energy transition plan,  

of which the details you will see in other 

parts of this report.

Risk Finance In A Hardening Insurance 

Environment

In 2020, the insurance industry saw a steady 

increase in premium rates, difficulty in placing 

100% of risks, and reductions in policy covers 

or terms. We expect this situation to carry on 

for the next couple of years and be further 

aggravated by the impact of the pandemic as 

insurers try to recover losses incurred across 

their portfolio.

Compared to 2019, the Aboitiz Group had lower 

insurance claims losses which is a testament 

of its improved risk management processes. 

Though  insurance premium rates continued to 

increase, mitigations on preventing insurance 

losses resulted in the improvement of the 

Group’s Total Cost of Insurable Risk (TCOIR), 

thereby decreasing from 1.30% to 1.27% against 

revenue.  This was driven primarily by lower 

retained losses incurred in 2020.

In response to this challenging environment, 

we focused on improving the Group’s risk 

profile through the review of our risk exposures 

adapted to the current needs of the business 

and addressed areas for improvement identified 

in our risk engineering surveys. Despite the 

limitation in conducting a physical engineering 

survey due to the pandemic, we were able to 

design a two-phased implementation plan that 

was agreed with our insurers.

In 2021, we will continue to explore new 

insurance markets to lessen placement difficulty, 

study viability of non-traditional risk transfer 

programs to  mitigate identified risks and 

optimize our captive participation to manage the 

increase in risk transfer costs.

Addressing The Needs Of Today and Tomorrow

Achieving harmony between sustainability 

and economic prosperity has been ingrained 

in the way we do things in Aboitiz. This is 

evident in how AboitizPower manages the 

balance between energy security, energy equity 

and environmental sustainability to ensure 

sustainable energy systems. In the Office of 

the CFO, we strive to take part in driving the 

company’s growth by making sure there is ample 

support for the company’s aspirations here and

As the market for sustainable investments 

gains momentum and scale in the world, 

we will continue to build our capability to 

attract and capture funding for our own 

contributions to solve the world’s most 

pressing issues.

Heading into the future, our drive to 

capitalize on new opportunities for growth 

and expansion, not just for the company, 

but for the countries we operate in, is at its 

highest. Under the Office of the CFO, we are 

committed to learning from the past century 

in order to thrust the organization steadily

With your continued support, we know we 

can build the foundations for the next one

abroad while aiming to align business activities 

with best practices.

As the organization sets its sights on the next 

100 years, we have been tasked to safeguard 

our course in the context of the ESG risks and 

opportunities that may arise as we navigate our 

way forward.

As a leader in most markets we play, it is our 

duty to address the country’s needs today, while 

simultaneously investing for tomorrow.

AEV, together with our partners, allocated 

PHP48.3 billion in capital expenditure for 2021, 

69% higher than the PHP28.5 billion used in 

2020. From this, PHP23.4 billion was set aside 

by our Power SBU for the completion of GN 

Power Dinginin as well as the Battery Energy 

Storage Projects. Similarly, our Infrastructure 

arm appropriated most of its PHP14.7 billion 

budget for the completion of Apo Agua and 

its entry into the telecommunications tower 

business. To the same extent, our food business 

is expecting to employ PHP4.5 billion mainly for 

feedmill expansions. 

Making up the balance are the allotments 

of the other SBUs. Our real estate business 

has allocated capital expenditure for land 

banking and the completion of its residential 

projects  while our Banking business will 

sustain its investment efforts in the continued 

enhancement of its digital touchpoints.

In terms of capital raising, the group started 

2021 strong. In March, AboitizPower issued P8.0 

billion worth of bonds, representing the first 

tranche of its newly established P30.0 billion 

shelf registration. The proceeds will be used to 

refinance maturing debt and prepay existing 

higher-cost debt, which will be an ongoing 

theme for the year. AEV and AP are exploring 

potentially returning to the bond markets in 

the second half of the year for more refinancing 

activities. 

In the area of project finance, AP is focused on 

funding in the renewables space - pursuing the 

refinancing of various hydro and solar entities.

For food, we are raising capital to fund various 

domestic and overseas expansion activities to 

address food security in the region. With regard 

to our infrastructure business, we are engaging 

with potential partners to explore and develop 

bespoke financing for our towers and airports 

initiatives. Finally, for our real estate arm, we 

are focused on terming out our existing loans, to 

take advantage of relatively low long term rates.

This is our commitment as proactive participants 

in the path to economic recovery as the country 

rises from the shadow of the pandemic.

Sustainable Finance And The Next 100 Years

In May last year, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas 

(Central Bank of the Philippines), issued a 

circular outlining its plan to promote sustainable 

finance in the Philippine banking system. This 

aligns the country with the global effort to use 

the financial system as a vehicle to address ESG-

risks and advance the sustainable development 

goals. As a first step, we are delighted that 

UnionBank is among the first banks in the 

country to put in place its Sustainable Finance 

Framework, which identifies what projects it 

aspires to fund under ICMA’s Green, Social, 

and Sustainability Bond Principles (and all its 

variants, including for loans). In a direct way, it 

will now be funding projects that are certified 

to be promoting environmental sustainability or 

addressing a social issue.

In 2020, AEV continued to be recognized as an S&amp;P Global 

Corporate Sustainability Assessment (formerly ROBECOSAM 

CSA) constituent company and scored 46% higher with a 

positive 23 points year-on-year increase that placed it in the 

66th percentile rank in the industrial conglomerates peer 

group, up from 43rd in 2019. AEV also received a rating of 

BBB in the MSCI ESG Ratings assessment in 2020 while, in 

March 2021, its Sustainalytics ESG risk rating also improved, 

lowering its risk rating by 5.1 point momentum compared 

to the previous year. This placed AEV in the 13th percentile 

(also ranking 14th out of 104 companies in the Industrial 

Conglomerate Sector) of the rater’s Industrial Conglomerate 

Universe. AEV also looks into the CDP reporting framework by 

including it in the company assessments of its ESG initiatives. 

AboitizPower’s 2020 ESG performance rating S&amp;P Global 

Corporate Sustainability Assessment rose by 74%, bringing 

its global peer group percentile ranking up to 54th 

percentile from 25th percentile in 2019. Since 2018, it has 

remained a constituent company in the FTSE4Good Index 

Series, which measures the performance of companies that 

demonstrate strong environmental, social, and governance 

(ESG) practices. Also in 2020, AboitizPower retained its BB 

rating from MSCI’s ESG Ratings assessment and gained a 

Sustainalytics ESG risk rating of 33.9 as result of lowered 

risk exposure by 3.5 point momentum.

Aboitiz Group’s

COVID-19 Response

Protect the Goose:

Aboitiz Group Facing COVID-19 Head-on

At the onset of the pandemic in December 2019, 

the Aboitiz Group already started to assess its 

potential impacts and risks to our business. We 

have first thought of the welfare of our 40,000 

team members located across 11 countries,

who are truly the lifeblood of our organization. 

In February 2020, a COVID-19 Technical Working 

Group was formed to monitor how the pandemic 

is progressing and to cascade information on 

proper precautionary measures.











Just like the ‘goose that lays the golden egg’, 

the Aboitiz Group will seek to protect its most 

important assets: its team members, our plants, 

and our facilities across the country.

While we’ve put trust in the hands of the 

government to lead us in finding the proper 

solutions, it is also imperative for businesses to 

do their part in helping alleviate the situation. 

In March 2020, Philippine President Rodrigo 

Duterte declared a state of public emergency 

following confirmed local cases and transmission 

of COVID-19. A lockdown in Metro Manila was 

imposed on March 15, forcing residents to 

undergo community quarantine. 

Through a group-wide virtual conference, 

Aboitiz Group President and CEO Sabin Aboitiz 

announced that team members must render 

work from home. Our early investments in 

future-proofing Aboitiz have given us a huge 

advantage in seamlessly transitioning from a 

physical work set-up to a digital workforce and 

ensuring all the proper channels and support 

are in place. Communications, stakeholder 

management, product sales, financial services, 

and employee learning were all delivered 

through online platforms. To ensure the 

financial security of team members, salaries and 

bonuses were released early. A select number 

of essential team members continue to work 

in their respective areas to ensure delivery of 

highly-needed basic services, such as power, 

banking, and food. To ensure their safety, we 

provided ample protective resources and basic 

needs such as testing (rapid tests, RT-PCR), food, 

clothing, and temporary shelter. Accessible health 

services are also made available to all our facilities 

nationwide. 



“Our team is focused on understanding 

COVID-19’s possible ramifications to 

our businesses. Offhand, the majority of 

our industries are actually resilient and 

are not as vulnerable as other sectors. 

Making sure that we maintain a strong 

balance sheet, the group has prepared 

contingency plans and made sufficient 

adjustments to manage major disruptions. 

We have prepared scenario plans for our 

businesses and are working to provide 

accessible health services to all our 

facilities nationwide. 

Our utmost concern now is the health 

and safety of our team members.  We 

adopted travel, quarantine, and hygiene 

measures.  All our team members, here 

and abroad, are constantly reminded of 

these measures and are given regular 

updates by our Covid-19 Technical 

Working Group. 

With the group’s effort in digital 

transformation, the group made great 

strides to “Future-proof Aboitiz”. This 

includes equipping team members across 

the group with digital tools, bringing 

engagement virtually, and allowing us 

to adjust to the work-from-home set-up 

easily.

Aboitiz Group continues to work closely 

with various stakeholders demonstrating 

ethical leadership and good governance 

while creating an enabling environment 

to serve the interests of people and planet 

through strengthened cooperation.”

Sabin M. Aboitiz

ABC in the time of COVID-19

Despite the pandemic, we continue to deliver 

our brand promise of advancing business and 

communities. Making sure that we maintain a 

strong balance sheet, our business units have 

implemented business continuity plans and 

financial assistance measures to ensure business-

as-usual for our clients and customers who are 

coming to terms with the new normal.

A Dose of Hope

The Aboitiz Group, along with more than 300 

private companies and 40 local government 

units committed to “A Dose of Hope”, a 

tripartite agreement among the private 

sector, the Philippine government, and British 

drugmaker AstraZeneca in support of the 

National Immunization Program. Half of the 

vaccines purchased will be donations for 

government frontline workers, while the other 

half will be for private-sector employees – 

both regular and contractual – provided they 

follow the government’s priority sectors for 

distribution.

Through its commitment to A Dose of Hope, 

the Aboitiz Group will be able to cover the 

inoculation of all its team members and 

subcontractors. AstraZeneca COVID-19 

vaccines will be offered to more than 30,000 

regular employees and subcontractors, to help 

build the community’s immunity against the 

virus. Each Business Unit will work directly 

with their respective subcontractor partners 

on the details of the vaccine rollout.

Availing Aboitiz team members and 

subcontractors shall be vaccinated in batches, 

prioritizing frontliners, senior citizens, and 

those with comorbidities, then the rest of 

the population. In the ASEAN region and 

other countries, Aboitiz team member 

vaccinations will be driven by various 

country governments where Aboitiz operates 

(particularly the Food Group). A vaccinated 

workforce will allow the Aboitiz Group to 

lead and significantly contribute to keeping 

the economy thriving under a better normal.

Over the last hundred years, the Aboitiz 

Group has proven its resilience to rise 

above the challenges. It has survived near 

bankruptcy, world wars, economic crises, 

and movements between islands, among 

other challenges.  For generations of Aboitiz 

team leaders and team members, past and 

present, what remained constant was our 

commitment to our time-honored values 

of integrity, teamwork, innovation, and 

responsibility. We always put our people 

first and ensure that we push for a balanced 

pursuit of financial gains and sustainability. 

Our rich history shows what we have 

achieved while using our values as our 

compass, and how these have enabled us to 

drive change for a better world by advancing 

business and communities. The COVID-19 

pandemic is far from over, but we are certain 

that together as #OneAboitiz, we will emerge 

from this crisis better and stronger.

The unprecedented challenges of

Communities. Our experiences and 

learnings from the past year made us 

stronger and more resilient than ever,

ready to conquer greater heights in

the next decade and beyond.

Emmanuel V. Rubio

President and CEO

AboitizPower

Powering through

2020 marked the achievement of AboitizPower’s

strategic goal of 4,000-megawatts (MW) of net

attributable capacity, setting the benchmark for

bolder and greater goals in the next decade, to

continue Advancing Business and Communities

for many more years. By the end of the year,

AboitizPower already owns 4,429 MW of net

attributable capacity with the addition of

GNPower Dinginin to our portfolio.

Then came the COVID-19 pandemic, severely

impacting the global economy and posing

unprecedented challenges even to well

established organizations like AboitizPower.

Thanks to our business continuity strategy,

we were able to quickly adapt to the situation,

ensuring uninterrupted service to our customers

and continued support for our stakeholders, all

while securing the safety and health of our team

members.

Despite the setbacks brought about by a global

health crisis, the company remained resilient and 

committed to fulfilling its mission of providing 

energy supply that is reliable, affordable, and 

sustainable. This endeavor is backed by our strong 

environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 

standards and practices, enabling us to operate 

while managing our impact to create long-term 

value for all our stakeholders.

For our Generation business, we were able to

successfully rehabilitate the Naga Power Plant

Complex, operated and managed by our business

unit Therma Power Visayas, Inc. (TPVI). The

rehabilitation increased the net sellable capacity

of the power plant to 39 MW, almost twice its

previous output. In the second quarter of 2020,

TPVI obtained a Provisional Authority to Operate

(PAO) from the Energy Regulatory Commission

(ERC), allowing it to proceed with the commercial

operations.

The pilot floating solar project of our joint venture,

SN Aboitiz Power (SNAP), had proven its viability

and had secured approval from the SNAP Board to

proceed with the engineering design for 67 MW.

While the construction timeline of our GNPower

Dinginin project continues to be challenged

by the imposition of lockdowns and travel

restrictions, the commissioning of Unit 1

is ongoing and is targeted for commercial

operations in August 2021. For Unit 2, the

completion and commercial operations dates

remain uncertain as of the first week of

April 2021 due to the ongoing community

quarantines and travel restrictions, thus

limiting the mobilization of foreign technical

experts required to commission certain

equipment and systems, and subsequently

impacting our construction timeline. An update

on the completion of Unit 2 will be provided

once the travel bans are lifted.

In 2020, AboitizPower also embarked on

its foray into battery technology, with pre-

construction and development activities for

SNAP’s 20-MW battery energy storage system

(BESS) in Ramon, Isabela and Therma Marine,

Inc.’s (TMI) 49-MW hybrid BESS in Maco,

Davao de Oro. These are among the 12 BESS

projects with a total capacity of 248 MW that

AboitizPower is targeting to develop in the next

10 years to ensure the stability and security of

the Philippine power grid.

Hedcor's FLS Hydro (6.4 MW, gross capacity) located in Bakun, Benguet

Meanwhile, our Distribution business continued keeping

the lights on for our customers and communities. Even with

the quarantine measures in place, efforts were made to do

meter readings for the majority of our customers and various

initiatives were implemented to make bills payment safer and

more convenient amid challenging times. All our distribution

units have complied with the applicable guidelines and

advisories from the Department of Energy (DOE) and ERC

despite its impact on our collection efficiency and cashflow.

Among the key achievements of our Distribution Group in

2020 was the franchise renewal of Davao Light and Power

Company. RA 11515 was signed into law effective December

26, 2020 to renew the Davao Light franchise for another 25

years once it expires in September 2025.

As part of our commitment to continuously improving

our services, Davao Light also launched its new Calinan

substation, Davao City’s first digital substation located

within the district. Cotabato Light and Power Company also

upgraded its Malagapas substation. These upgrades provide

our distribution utilities with an increased energy capacity,

ensuring the reliability and better delivery of power supply

across our franchise areas.

The two 50-MW transformers of Malvar Enerzone Corporation

were successfully energized and started supplying the energy

needs of the various locators of the 212-hectare Light Industry

&amp; Science Park IV (LISP IV) in Malvar, Batangas.

These operational developments, both in our Generation and

Distribution businesses, are well aligned with our availability

and reliability targets to ensure the continued delivery of

our energy products and services to the customers and

communities we serve.

Positive energy

At the core of AboitizPower’s 2020 milestones was the

positive energy that gave our 1AP team a boost up, along 

with our 1AP culture of high performance, owner’s mindset, 

learning and growth, atmosphere, and our values of integrity, 

teamwork, innovation, responsibility, and service excellence.

With this positive energy, all our team members — onsite,

in the field, and working from home — contributed to our

strategic objectives and helped ensure that these remain

relevant to our stakeholders. Even while grappling with the

impact of the pandemic themselves, our 1AP team went the

extra mile to support one another and worked together to

fulfil our ABC.

We were able to sustain our corporate social

responsibility (CSR) efforts for our customers and

host communities. We continued to be stewards

of our environment through various conservation

initiatives. We remained steadfast and always

ready to lend a helping hand to typhoon-stricken

areas, as well as communities that needed support

in the fight against COVID-19.

In 2020, AboitizPower was also not short of

accomplishments in terms of our ESG performance.

AboitizPower has continued to be recognized as

a constituent company in the FTSE4Good Index

Series for three years in a row, affirming our

long-standing commitment to sustainability.

We have also seen an improvement in our score

in the Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA),

from 69th place in 2019, we now rank 47th in this

global benchmarking index.

With our invaluable experiences and learnings

from 2020, AboitizPower is well positioned to carry

out our growth strategy in the next 10 years and

support the country’s economic growth

and recovery.

Our key strategy remains the same, which is to

aggressively expand our Cleanergy portfolio, aiming

for a 50:50 balance between our Cleanergy

AboitizPower is a pioneer of renewable energy

in the Philippines and today, together with our

partners, we are the country’s largest owner

and operator of renewable energy based on

installed capacity.

While we continue to help address the country’s

energy trilemma of energy security, energy

equity, and environmental sustainability, we

will also pursue our international aspirations,

focusing on wind, hydro, and solar projects.

We will also explore gas as an addition to our

portfolio in an effort to serve our ever-increasing

baseload energy demand.

We are bullish about the future of AboitizPower

and of the country as the economy is slowly

getting back on track and with the government’s

well thought out roadmap for the power sector.

With the unwavering support of our 1AP

team and our strong partnerships with our

stakeholders, we trust that AboitizPower will be

able to sustain the positive energy and continue

to add value to the Aboitiz Group’s 100 years of

Advancing Business and Communities.

ABC Story

AboitizPower gives much needed 

boost in local pandemic response

Experts have been warning of a pandemic for several 

decades already, and while developments in the field 

of medical science are far more advanced today than 

it was 30 years ago, nobody expected the effects of 

COVID-19 across all facets of life to be this dire.

Economies across the globe, even the most developed 

ones, were not spared from the health crisis. 

Businesses are still reeling from the repercussions 

of extended lockdowns and the staggered rollout of 

vaccines has left communities in developing countries 

vulnerable.

The Aboitiz Group’s power arm, AboitizPower, had 

its share of organizational challenges brought about 

by the pandemic in 2020, but these did not hinder 

the company from fulfilling its promise of advancing 

business and communities.

At the onset of local quarantines in the country, the 

Department of Energy (DOE) issued a circular allowing 

communities that host power generation projects to 

use their revenue shares from these facilities under 

the Energy Regulations No. 1-94 (ER 1-94) program

to help combat the effects of COVID-19.

“Given the severity of the COVID-19 crisis, we at the 

DOE came up with the necessary circular that would 

enable host LGUs to use their available ER 1-94 funds 

to augment their COVID-19 response funding,”

DOE Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi said.

“We are pleased to learn that our vision is being fully 

realized. Malayo ang nararating ng bawat tulong sa 

panahon nitong pandemya (Every help goes a long 

way during this pandemic),” he added.

Emmanuel V. Rubio welcomed this move, saying 

this development was a push in the right direction 

as it was expected to aid in strengthening local 

government response to the ongoing health crisis.

“This is our contribution to the government’s efforts 

to ensure that all LGUs have enough resources to 

help contain, mitigate, and eventually eliminate the 

spread of COVID-19 in their areas,” Rubio added.

As of December 2020, the AboitizPower group and 

the DOE have remitted a total of P671 million in 

direct benefits to around 130 host communities

all over the Philippines, helping them stay afloat

during these trying times.

The ER 1-94 Program is a policy under the DOE Act 

of 1992 and the Electric Power Industry Reform 

Act of 2001 (EPIRA), which stipulates that host 

communities will get a share of one centavo for 

every kilowatt-hour (P0.01/kWh) generated

by power plants operating in its area.

The fund can be used by host beneficiaries for the 

electrification of areas or households that have 

no access to power, development and livelihood 

programs, as well as reforestation, watershed 

management, health, and environmental 

enhancement initiatives.

The circular covering ER 1-94 funds allows host LGUs 

to use their shares to help manage their COVID-19 

response in accordance with the Bayanihan to Heal 

as One Act. 

Initiatives that were implemented by 

AboitizPower’s host LGUs include holding areas 

or distribution centers, medical and PPE supplies, 

facility decontamination, and relief goods to feed 

low-income households during the prolonged 

quarantine period.

AboitizPower has been at the forefront of social 

development in its host communities throughout 

the years and will even be more so as the nation 

continues to face this health crisis. 

In strategic collaboration with our partner 

organizations and local governments, we will 

pursue our brand promise of advancing business 

and communities even more implicitly as the nation 

continues to face this global health crisis.

UnionBank

Result of Operations

It was a challenging year due to 

COVID-19, yet UnionBank emerged 

resilient with above-industry profitability 

and a strong balance sheet. With the 

pandemic fast-tracking the digital 

tipping point, we will continue to 

accelerate our digital strategy and 

initiatives. We remain committed in 

promoting digital transformation to our 

customers and partners, in line with our 

mission to Tech Up Pilipinas!

“

”

Weak consumer and investor sentiment, 

high unemployment rate, and a slowdown 

in business activity are among the adverse 

economic effects of the COVID-19 crisis. These 

factors led to dampened demand for credit and 

the rise of non-performing loans in the banking 

industry.

As of end-2020, the Philippine banking industry 

registered lackluster asset growth of 6% year-

on-year (YoY), while total loans declined by 

1%. The industry’s net income also declined by 

33%, mainly due to the 4.2 times increase in 

credit reserves set aside by most banks as loan 

quality deteriorated similar to the 2008 Global 

Financial Crisis.

In response to the effects of the pandemic, 

UnionBank also increased loan loss reserves 

by 4.5 times to PHP8.4 billion. But despite the 

unusually high provisions, the Bank recorded 

a net income of PHP11.6 billion and posted 

a return on equity of 11.5%, higher than the 

industry’s 6.6%.

UnionBank’s topline revenues remained strong. 

Net revenues were at an all-time high at PHP42.1 

billion. Net interest income increased by 29% to 

PHP28.7 billion as margins increased by 76 basis 

points (bps) to 4.7%. Our higher margins were 

due to: the record-high current account and 

savings account (CASA) deposit growth of 24% to 

PHP258.7 billion; continued expansion of high-

yielding consumer, SME, and commercial loans; 

and reduced funding cost amid the low interest 

rate environment in 2020. Strong trading gains 

amounting to PHP8.9 billion also gave topline 

revenues a boost.

Moreover, growth in our operating expenses 

was kept at single digit as increases in volume-

related expenses were partially offset by lower 

controllable costs.

Our capital ratios also remained above 

regulatory requirements with common equity 

tier 1 (CET1) ratio at 15.0% and capital adequacy 

ratio (CAR) at 17.0%. Overall, we were able 

to withstand the impacts of the crisis while 

maintaining a strong balance sheet.

UnionBank: 2nd Most Helpful Bank in the

Asia Pacific 

In June, UnionBank was recognized as the 2nd 

Most Helpful Bank in Asia Pacific during the 

COVID-19 crisis — and the only Philippine bank 

to place in the list’s top 20 — according to the 

BankQuality™ Consumer Survey and Rankings. 

This not only affirmed our commitment to 

deliver superior service to customers but 

also demonstrated our capability to operate 

smoothly despite various pandemic-related 

restrictions.

On Day 1 of the enhanced community 

quarantine, all critical functions remained 

operational despite having 80% of head office 

employees working from home. Our teams, 

equipped with the necessary digital tools, have 

on-demand access to the bank’s cloud-based 

systems and applications.

Majority of UnionBank’s branches remained 

open with full banking services and ATMs were 

constantly loaded to support our customers’ 

liquidity needs. Our 5G-enabled Bank-on-

Wheels banking kiosks served distant areas 

with large transaction requirements while 

our call center also continued to provide 24/7 

customer assistance.

Metrics That Matter


Annual and Sustainability Report 2020

Moreover, our online banking channels — the 

UnionBank Online app for retail, The Portal for 

corporate cash management solutions, and SME 

Banking App for MSMEs — were up and running so that 

customers could perform banking functions whenever, 

wherever.

We also heeded our customers’ call to alleviate their 

financial burden. Through Bayanihan Acts 1 and 2, we 

extended loan payments without penalties or additional 

fees. We were also among the first to waive online fund 

transfer fees and extended this well into 2021 . Most 

importantly, we continued to extend credit to sectors 

that needed them the most, such as MSMEs and our 

mass market customers. 

With a culture that is agile and adaptive, we were quick 

to introduce new features in our UnionBank Online app 

to promote safe and secure banking from home. For 

instance, we were able to launch the app’s ‘send money 

to remittance centers’ feature after only three weeks 

from the time our project squad decided to add it. We 

also rolled out our online check deposit functionality, 

expanded our list of billers, introduced foreign exchange 

capabilities, and enabled subscriptions to investment 

products. Moreover, our customers could already 

deposit to their accounts via the 11,000 ECPay partners, 

which include 7-11, LCC, RD Pawnshop, Tambunting, and 

Czarina Money Exchange — all with outlets nationwide.

UnionBank also collaborated with the public sector to 

assist in relief efforts and fulfill shared goals. We 

partnered with the Department of Social Welfare and 

Development (DSWD) for the distribution of Social 

Amelioration Program funds to the 1.3 million-plus 

beneficiaries allocated to us. EON, our digital mass 

market brand, was also tapped by several LGUs such 

as Parañaque City and Imus City, and institutions like 

LIGHT Microfinance and Public Safety Savings and Loan 

Association, Inc. (PSSLAI), which needed assistance in 

disbursing cash and loans to constituents.

Lastly, UnionBank launched an app-based blockchain-

enabled distribution system for the Bureau of the 

Treasury’s (BTr) retail treasury bonds called Bonds.ph 

with digital KYC (Know Your Customer) identity check 



capabilities. A first in Asia, Bonds.ph is not 

only a convenient way of investing without

needing to go to a bank branch, it has 

also, ultimately, helped the country in 

raising additional funds for the national 

government’s pandemic response.

Digital Gaining Traction; Time for 

Acceleration 

Philippine digital banking certainly took 

flight as a result of COVID-19. By end-

2020, PESONet and InstaPay have recorded 

triple-digit increases —  at 376% and 460%, 

respectively — in terms of volume of 

electronic fund transfers compared to

end-2019. The banking industry also ramped 

up digital transformation plans while the 

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), as a 

testament to the role of digital in achieving 

financial inclusion, laid out its 3-year digital 

payments transformation roadmap and its 

framework for setting up pure digital banks.

In the same manner, UnionBank experienced 

impressive digital traction during the 

pandemic. As of February 2021, UnionBank 

Online app users breached 2.2 million-level 

while the number of corporate customers 

in The Portal has topped 17,000, majority 

of them onboarded during the pandemic. 

Of this, 25% or more than 560,000, opened 

their accounts digitally, 23x times higher 

than the figures in 2019. Digital transactions 

such as fund transfers, bills payments, and 

online check deposits were also at all-time 

highs with monthly volume reaching 5.5 

million in February 2021, 4.1 times higher 

than in 2019.

online shop builder; and beyond 23,000 

signups in the SeekCap online lending 

marketplace. 

Given the pronounced shift of customer 

behavior towards digital, UnionBank is going 

full throttle in its transformation journey. 

We will fast track our long-term plans 

starting with accelerating the onboarding of 

customers onto our digital channels.

We shall ramp-up data science-backed 

digital marketing initiatives to encourage 

digital account opening among prospects. 

UBX will continue to grow MSME 

communities in i2i, Sentro, BUX, and 

SeekCap platforms, while CitySavings will 

ramp up expansion of its motorcycle and 

pension loan customers to further diversify 

its credit portfolio.

Following this, we shall maximize customer 

engagement through enhanced features 

across our digital channels. We will 

continue to leverage data science and 

artificial intelligence to churn out our next 



best offers and go full speed ahead on our retail 

and MSME lending initiatives. 

To support these growth aspirations, we are 

further beefing up our back-end capabilities. We 

accelerated our Cloud Transformation Program 

for the 100% migration of our systems and 

applications to a hybrid public cloud infrastructure. 

Moreover, we will be complementing Agile Ways 

of Working with DevSecOps. This aims to shorten 

the timeframe between testing and deployment of 

applications, providing continuous delivery without 

compromising quality, as we move towards 

addressing customer needs at the exact moment of 

truth.

The Bank also intends to keep its lead in the

space of innovation. With the emergence of the 

new regulations on open banking and digital 

banking, UnionBank is already gearing up to keep 

up with the entry of purely digital banks and shift 

towards an open finance environment for when 

adoption intensifies.      

Moreover, we will continue to explore and

experiment on new technologies, keeping a close 

watch on how banking will evolve in the future. 

One such area is in Distributed Ledger Technology 

(DLT), where we pioneered bond tokenization 

for the issuance of retail bonds on a blockchain 

platform co-created with SC Ventures. We also 

aim to increase participation in the trade finance 

market via a blockchain platform, being one of the 

processes that are most relevant for blockchain 

disruption. Furthermore, UBX will continue to

test emerging business models via building its 

own startups or investment in fintechs or

strategic partners. 

Now, more than ever, UnionBank shall boost its 

“Tech Up Pilipinas” efforts focused on promoting 

digital transformation. As we co-create innovations 

and empower more individuals and organizations 

with digital capabilities, we shall emerge more 

resilient from this crisis.

ABC Story

Tech Up Pilipinas! Leveraging 

UnionBank’s digital transformation

for social good

The intersection of newer financial tools and technology 

is creating an enormous impact that can help unleash a 

sustainable development revolution. Among the country’s 

pioneers in banking innovation is UnionBank and we are 

stepping up our efforts for Tech Up Pilipinas.

Tech Up Pilipinas is the natural result of the bank’s digital 

transformation over the years. From a “brick-and-mortar” 

model, we are moving into the “tech-firm-with-banking-

capabilities” model, which is the building block of our own 

brand of sustainability. It is driven by investments and 

partnerships that enable and empower people to co-create 

innovations for a better world.

Financial technology for Filipinos

Pandemic or not, we have always envisioned a bank that 

will allow more Filipinos, especially the unbanked and 

marginalized, to adopt digital banking services and

enable them to become active partners of our Tech Up 

Pilipinas mission. 

Launching UBX as our tech arm is just the beginning.

We are activating units that are geared towards financial 

inclusion and social empowerment. Our SME business 

banking unit has intensified the campaign to onboard 

more Filipino entrepreneurs into the GlobalLinker. This 

is a digital platform designed for the 350,000 members 

globally so they are connected and provided with the right 

knowledge and tools to accelerate the growth of their 

businesses. One such tool is the recently launched SME 

Business Banking App, focused on providing online banking 

services and marketplace solutions with speed, ease, and 

trustworthiness as our key competitive advantage. 

Moreover, to help MSMEs convert to the online platform, 

UBX offers the payment gateway BUX and digital shop 

builder Sentro. BUX can be integrated into an online 

seller’s platform while Sentro helps entrepreneurs 

set their online shops. Sentro has built-in 

protections for both the sellers and buyers, as

well as logistics services. There are more than 

95,000 users of BUX and close to 30,000 sign-ups 

for Sentro. 

Meanwhile, SeekCap, the Philippines’ first

same-day approval lending marketplace, supports 

MSMEs by providing them with sources of credit 

without having to fill in lengthy loan applications. 

To date, we have recorded more than 23,000

sign-ups and disbursed loans over PHP100 million. 

Redefining sustainability, the UnionBank way

We have set in place UnionBank’s sustainable 

finance framework in order to facilitate issuances 

of green bonds, social bonds, and even tech bonds. 

In line with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, we 

recognize that our  main contribution to sustainable 

development and social good is in ensuring 

that financial capital is invested in responsible 

organizations and customers whose businesses 

aim to improve quality of life and the planet. We 

believe that by supporting the development of 

people’s digital and innovation capabilities, we can 

collectively improve products and services that will 

have less toll on our planet.

In UnionBank’s case, we envision our sustainable 

financing program to enable our clients and 

partners to co-design with us innovative solutions 

and technology that create better products and 

services while contributing to sustainability targets. 

These targets include socioeconomic advancement 

and empowerment, access to essential services, 

employment generation, renewable energy, energy 

efficiency, and pollution prevention technology, 

among others. 

We already have products and platforms in place 

that promote socio economic advancement and 

empowerment as evidenced by UBX and its various  

financially-inclusive initiatives developed in just 

a year. Meanwhile, our mass market arm and 

subsidiary CitySavings Bank is also in a sweet spot 

to carry out sustainable financing activities as its 

portfolio is aligned to social sustainability. 

Our corporate social responsibility (CSR) is serving 

as an incubator of ideas with a pointed focus 

towards sustainability. Through this new kind of 

CSR, we have  the ability to  create more, reach 

more, and make a bigger impact by doing what 

we do best – innovate and accelerate. 

For instance, one of our CSR initiatives led to the 

nationwide campaign to build the digital skills of 

800,000 public school teachers through the timely 

and innovative idea of our employee volunteers 

to design on-demand, easy-to-use, and engaging 

learning modules. This has been adopted by the 

national government and is being implemented by 

the Department of Education across the country. 

The ABC story goes on

With the same spirit of Ubuntu – that sense

of being part of a community – and a compassion 

for others in need, we at UnionBank can leverage 

our DNA of innovation and digital tools to make 

a difference. Whether using digital platforms like 

Sentro and Bux to build online presence,

SeekCap to raise funds, or mobile apps like

Bonds.ph, technology can be used by a bank 

to truly create social good. Our goal is to fully 

align our digital transformation strategy with 

sustainable value creation. This is an opportunity 

for us to join the very clear call of advancing 

business and communities and we will do this by 

co-creating innovations for a better world.





Target 9.2 Promote inclusive and sustainable 

industrialization and, by 2030, significantly 

raise industry’s share of employment and 

gross domestic product, in line with national 

circumstances 

Target 8.2 Achieve higher levels of economic 

productivity through diversification,

Result of Operations

As challenging as it was, I believe that 2020 brought 

out the best in our team members. The resilience they 

demonstrated can be seen in the group’s growth, 

overall, amidst a rapidly changing market and 

environment.

We owe our resilience to our Aboitiz values which 

played a crucial role in how we managed the twin 

pandemics and how we adjusted our strategies to take 

advantage of opportunities where they emerged.

Truly, 2020 is a testament to what we can do together 

as One Food Group - to fulfill our mission of feeding 

humanity and advancing business and communities.

“

”

Powering through disruption with a strong, 

values-driven culture

2020 brought much complexity to our

operations and the Food Group relied on our strong, 

values-driven team to keep us on track with our 

goals and objectives. Foremost of these is ensuring 

an unhampered supply of food products for 20% of 

Filipinos and other ASEAN markets that depend on 

us for their livelihood.

We are proud of the exceptional teamwork that 

enabled us to play a bigger role in creating solutions 

for our customers’ rapidly evolving needs. Pandemic 

or not, it was a year of growth for the Food Group 

as we broke ground on several major expansions:

Operationalized our Tarlac Meat Masters,

a Triple-A meat cutting facility with a capacity 

to process over 80,000 kilos worth of meat per 

day. This is a big step in our effort to reach “the 

last mile” while gaining efficiency in our meat 

production.

Commissioned our third Feedmill line in Iligan, 

adding a capacity of 20TPH to support the 

growing demand for feeds in the Visayas and 

Mindanao region.

Pre-commissioning of our Fish Feed Line in

Ha Nam, North Vietnam, with a capacity of

5TPH designed to cater to the increasing fish 

feeds demand.

Diversifying into aquaculture and pet food

Many of our plans, which were originally

Annual and Sustainability Report 2020

In 2016, Pilmico was the testing ground for the 

Aboitiz Group’s digital transformation. We were

the first to introduce an agile workplace, 

telecommuting, harnessing the digital space to

enhance customer experience, and many more. 

Those same investments in systems and people

have brought gains for the Food Group in 2020 

through our utilization of data dashboards in

decision making, e-commerce to increase customer 

reach, and virtual platforms to shift support services 

online.

Strengthening customer relationships through 

digitalization

We took full advantage of digital channels and 

social media in order to continue consultations and 

customer visits with partners in the Philippines. 

These same channels carried our learning cascades 

and webinars, which turned out to be much more 

beneficial as more participants were able to join each 

session.

Concentrate Plus, a similar initiative in Indonesia, 

provided online solutions to customers including 

group chat consultations with veterinary experts. 

Through it, the Indonesia team strengthened 

customer relationships and even created new 

markets.

Our supply chain management remained intact 

through the implementation of flexible collection 

and payment methods while some essential CAPEX 

pushed through to protect the

bottom line.

The pocket innovations led by our team members 

are key to our continued market management and 

have paved the way for building more meaningful 

relationships with our customers despite the physical 

limitations of the COVID-19 pandemic.



The shift to e-commerce

With the changes in retail consumers’ buying 

behavior and in available dining options, we 

launched our e-commerce initiatives to bring our 

Maxime premium dog food brand and The Good 

Meat top-quality farm products directly to homes 

via Lazada and Shopee.

We will further support our long-term outlook 

in the Food and Agri space by activating more 

dynamic brand and marketing strategies to 

increase market presence and awareness.

Advancing business and communities

through values

The twin pandemics of African swine fever and 

COVID-19 would have been insurmountable if

not for the resilience and agile response of our 

people. Whether it was our team in China who

explored alternative raw materials amid 

logistical challenges at the height of the 

health crisis or our team in Vietnam who 

took advantage of their raw material storage

ABC Story

Capiz fisherfolk reap benefits

from Pilmico fish farm training

Early in 2020, fisherfolk in Capiz received technical 

assistance through  Pilmico’s Bangon Capiznon 

initiative  following the onslaught of Typhoon Ursula 

in Capiz.

This same aid has consistently helped them weather 

the challenges brought by the COVID-19, allowing 

them to earn more and post better fish growth amid 

the health crisis.

In February 2020, the Pilmico Aqua Feeds team 

turned over 1.3 million bangus fry to help Capiz 

fishermen rebuild their typhoon-depleted fish 

stocks.  They, along with fish cage owners, gained 

technical knowledge about fish feeds ratios, proper 

use and scheduling of feeds variants, and fish cage 

specifications to promote a better fish-growing 

environment.

Additional earnings, faster and better growth

From February to October 2020, the beneficiaries 

have been earning an additional PHP10 to PHP15 

per kilo — thanks to increased fish growth and 

performance — and avoiding additional losses 

from inefficient feeding practices. Compared to 

other brands, Pilmico’s aqua feeds result in faster 

and better growth, with an average of 15 to 20 

days earlier harvesting time. The Bangon Capiznon 

beneficiaries have harvested 15 tons of fish or 

approximately 13,607 kilograms.

“I’d say it was the right timing to receive assistance 

from their team. The business partnership with 

Pilmico helped small-time fishermen and fish cage 







owners (Nasa tamang timing talaga kasi yung business 

partnership na yan kay Pilmico, natulungan yung mga 

small-time na fisherman dito at ang mga fish cage 

owners din),” said Moreno Gonzaga, a fisherman and 

beneficiary of Bangon Capiznon.  

Pilmico’s flexible feed payment terms is helping to 

speed up business recovery while the Pilmico Aqua 

Feeds team is helping to close technical knowledge 

gaps in proper fish cage management and aqua feeds 

ratios. The team’s consistent technical support and 

regular, almost-daily visits — according to Gonzaga — 

have greatly helped in proper fish growth monitoring.

Reliability of supplies and services

Gonzaga shares that what sets Pilmico apart is 

reliability, which helped them with feed efficiency.

“Before we started using Pilmico feeds, other brands 

always ran out of stock. When that happens, we had 

to switch to a different feed brand mid-season. When 

we change fish feeds, what happens is their growth 

is affected. This is because they are not used to the 

new brand introduced (Dati [nung hindi pa Pilmico], 

palaging nauubusan ng supply yung ibang feeds brand. 

Kaya ang nangyayari, kalagitnaan ng season ng isda, 

nagpapalit kami ng brand ng feeds. Kapag ganun 

na nag-iiba ng pakain, hindi sanay ang isda, ang 

nangyayari ay naapektuhan ang paglaki nila),”

he said.

He regards Pilmico as a reliable brand because of its 

uninterrupted supply of feeds and services.

Richard Rafio, Pilmico Feeds Category Manager 

for Aqua, confirmed that amid the pandemic 

restrictions, their team has been consistent in 

delivering services to Bangon Capiznon beneficiaries.

“In the last few months since we launched this 

initiative, our team has been working with the Roxas 

City government and we also got endorsements 

from the BFAR [Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic 

Resources],” shared Rafio. “We acknowledge the 

hard work that our team members on site have been 

putting in, and this was complemented by essential 

support from the government.”

Cosette V. Canilao

President and CEO

Aboitiz InfraCapital

Result of Operations

The spirit of the Aboitiz Group’s 

enduring 100-year legacy resonates 

in the tremendous resilience of Aboitiz 

InfraCapital and Republic Cement 

in 2020. We stand ready to support 

the government by investing in the 

development of sustainable infrastructure 

projects and growing our industrial 

estates. We believe public and private 

sector collaboration will be crucial in 

helping rebuild our economy from the 

impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“

”

In 2020, Aboitiz InfraCapital (InfraCap) was set 

to harvest the seeds it planted in previous years 

with a number of projects expected to either 

launch operations or receive final approval from 

the government. However, like much of the 

Aboitiz Group and many other companies, we 

faced a number of headwinds largely caused by 

COVID-19.

Amid the challenging period for economies and 

businesses around the world, we remained true 

to our commitment to uplift lives by continuing 

to push for enabling infrastructure. We quickly 

shifted gears by activating the Business 

Continuity Plans of our operating business 

units and reviewing our project proposals 

to ensure viability in the next few years. 

Leveraging existing Aboitiz Group assets, we 

also launched a new business unit to support 

telecommunication companies (telcos) and 

Internet Service Providers (ISPs) at a time when 

people rely on the internet the most.

Today, we continue to pursue key initiatives 

to support the government in implementing 

strategic infrastructure programs and deliver on 

projects that provide value-adding facilities and 

services to Filipinos.

Keeping the water flowing

Along with other Aboitiz business units in 

Southern Luzon, Lima Water Corporation (LWC) 

experienced disruption at the onset of 2020 

with the eruption of the Taal Volcano in January. 

Operations at the LIMA Technology Center (LTC) 

were limited during the immediate aftermath as 

the Aboitiz teams worked together to clear the 

industrial park of ash fall and offer assistance 

to the affected communities. Less than two 



Metrics That Matter

months later, the national government imposed 

Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) in 

Luzon, which further impacted operations 

at LTC. LWC continued to operate during this 

period to ensure continuous water supply for 

all the skeleton workforce at LTC.

While LWC’s average billed volume dipped 

in the first half of 2020, it has since posted 

pre-ECQ levels by the third quarter as locators 

recovered losses from the first half of the year. 

To offer relief and convenience to locators, 

we extended initial payment due dates and 

introduced new alternative payment channels 

during the lockdown.

In June 2020, LWC was officially accredited by 

the Department of Environment and Natural 

Resources (DENR) as one of its Recognized 

Environmental Laboratories and the first and 

only industrial park water services provider 

to become such. This license allowed us to 

extend laboratory services to locators in LTC in 

September and, later, to locators from nearby 

industrial parks. During the lockdown, we also 

took the opportunity to implement production 

efficiency programs to improve power usage in 

our deepwell facilities.

Meanwhile, the lockdown in Davao City meant 

Apo Agua Infrastructura, Inc. (Apo Agua) had 

to temporarily suspend construction activities 

for the Davao City Bulk Water Supply Project 

(DCBWSP), our joint venture with J.V. Angeles 

Construction Corporation (JVACC).

Construction eventually resumed in mid-May, 

with JVACC working on the Raw Water Facility, 

Water Treatment Plant, and Treated Water 

Pipeline. Our focus centered on ensuring 

workers’ health and well-being amidst the 

pandemic as JVACC imposed work clustering, 

social distancing protocols, and other safety 

measures in accordance with government 

guidelines. To mitigate dire impact, JVACC has 

been implementing an aggressive manpower

ramp-up, simultaneous work and extended hours on different 

worksites, and subcontracting works. Round-the-clock pipe 

fabrication supplements all these efforts to fast-track the project. 

While we are continuously reassessing how COVID-19 affects our 

construction program, we remain focused on achieving first drop

of water by December this year.

InfraCap maintains its minority stake of 15.94% in Balibago 

Waterworks Systems, Inc. (BWSI), allowing us to further participate 

in serving the water needs of over 235,000 households spanning 11 

regions.

Enhancing PH’s digital infrastructure

Our mission to help improve the country’s digital infrastructure 

continues especially with the pandemic underscoring the increased 

demand for cellular and internet access.

We have ongoing discussions with mobile network operators Globe 

Telecom, DITO Telecommunity, and PLDT-Smart for the lease of 

build-to-suit tower sites and other passive telecommunications 

infrastructure. Onsite surveys and acquisitions restarted following 

the lifting of ECQ. In September 2020, we were granted our 

provisional registration as an Independent Tower Company by 

the Department of Information and Communications Technology 

(DICT).

Heeding the government’s urgent call to help improve the country’s 

information and communications technology infrastructure by 

the end of the year, we started to offer our existing small cell 

sites in key urban cities to telcos and ISPs, officially launching it as 

InfraCap’s newest business unit. We soon entered into partnership 

agreements with Globe Telecom and DITO Telecommunity for the 

deployment of their small cell attachments in Cebu and Davao.

A small cell network is a series of small low-powered, short-ranged 

antennas that provide coverage and capacity, meant to work in 

conjunction with macro cell towers. Small cells are expected to play 

a key role in the deployment of 5G, which requires antenna density 

to deliver larger quantities of data at higher speeds.

We are looking at growing our small cell sites footprint as we 

anticipate increasing demand within the next two years. We 

are most keen on expanding in other key cities in Visayas and 

Mindanao where network congestion is a primary issue that 

hampers service quality.

A gateway to recovery

In the face of the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on the air 

travel and airport business, we remain committed to pursuing our 



unsolicited proposals for the Bohol Panglao 

International Airport and Laguindingan 

Airport. We believe that these projects are 

vital to reviving the economy and are aligned 

with our objective to support regional growth 

centers outside of the National Capital Region.  

InfraCap’s discussions with the government 

continue to take place, both parties assessing 

the most prudent way to move forward with 

the projects.

Harnessing natural synergies

With great challenges also came new 

opportunities. In September 2020, AEV made 

a strategic decision for InfraCap to take over 

the industrial and commercial business units 

(ICBU) of AboitizLand. Apart from allowing 

AboitizLand to focus on its residential 

portfolio, this move supports InfraCap’s 

approach in expanding the various businesses 

and projects around the Group’s existing 

assets and resources, thereby harnessing 

inherent synergies seamlessly. 

The resilient financial performance of ICBU 

or the Aboitiz Integrated Economic Centers 

throughout the year was driven by the 

recognition of 36 hectares of industrial 

lots. The industrial business’ performance 

tempered the decrease in revenue 

contribution from the commercial business, 

despite rental concessions extended to 

tenants throughout the pandemic.

We are fortunate that disruption to industrial 

operations last year was kept to a minimum 

with a majority of our locators remaining 

operational through the Taal Volcano eruption 

and the strictest periods of the lockdown. 

To ensure continuous operations during the 

ECQ, we quickly implemented strict COVID-19 

protocols at all facilities. We also hold regular 

virtual meetings with locators and tenants 

regarding procedures on reporting systems, 

contact tracing, infection control, and other 

COVID-19-related matters.

As expected, the local shopping mall industry 

has been severely challenged by the ongoing 

pandemic. To support our tenants, we have 

provided rental concessions in

The Outlets at Lipa and Pueblo Verde.

We have also instituted programs that

leverage the open-air format of these 

malls, which is deemed safer for 

shopping and dining. These programs 

include providing alternative purchasing 

channels, allowing the use of alfresco 

areas free of charge, and providing 

safe events for the community, such as 

outdoor movies, drive thru markets, and 

a drive-in mass. While foot traffic and 

tenant sales have begun to do better, we 

foresee that shopping malls will continue 

to face challenges in 2021.

To ensure the safety of our mall 

visitors, strict COVID-19 measures are 

enforced such as social distancing, hand 

sanitization, wearing masks and face 

shields, and technology-aided

contact tracing.   

Despite the pandemic, exciting things 

are in store for the Aboitiz Integrated 

Economic Centers. Capitalizing on the 

demand for industrial spaces in Batangas 

and Cebu, we will expand and transform 

our three economic zones into smart 

integrated economic centers, supported 

by a complete ecosystem of infrastructure 

and the latest digital technology.

Testing cement’s resilience

Construction was among the industries 

heavily affected by the COVID-19 crisis. 

Coming from a strong start in early 2020, 

construction activities in Luzon and parts 

of Visayas and Mindanao stopped for two 

months during the ECQ. Stricter health 

protocols and limited transportation 

availability also contributed to the 

slowdown. In response, Republic Cement 

has put in place rigid procedures to 

mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the 

workplace. These include health screening, 

social distancing, sanitation of work areas, 

and strict observance of PPE.

Despite the challenges brought by 

COVID-19, Republic Cement completed 

and commissioned new mills, adding 2 

million tons of capacity to its existing 7.5 

MTPA (million tons per annum) capacity. 

We have also benefited from the kiln 

debottlenecking done in 2019, which 

improved cost competitiveness and 

reduced dependency on imported clinker. 

To address challenges in waste 

management, we officially launched 







ecoloop, Republic’s resource recovery group. To date, ecoloop 

has partnered with more than 30 LGUs and FMCG companies, 

with a common goal towards promoting plastic neutrality in 

the Philippines.

Republic Cement remains focused on serving its key markets 

throughout the country with high-quality products, while 

improving efficiencies and reducing costs. Production 

costs remained in control following the implementation 

of operational excellence initiatives. In addition, Republic 

Cement has put in place several cost-cutting and cash 

optimization measures.

Looking forward, the construction outlook for 2021 is positive. 

The government is allotting a sizable chunk of the 2021 

national budget for infrastructure. Various economists are also 

projecting the economy to bounce back and grow by over 6%. 

The economic recovery would drive demand for residential 

and non-residential segments. Downside risk pertains to the 

lingering effects of the pandemic on the economic activities, 

which would also impact construction demand.

Despite this, we will continue our record-breaking 

performance at Republic Cement in line with our commitment 

to meet the demands of the local building and construction 

industry. We will also continue to staunchly support the 

Philippine government’s Buy Lokal, Go Lokal! programs, as an 

industry leader and proud manufacturer of the country’s best 

quality cement used in building a safer, greener, and stronger 

Republic.

The next 10 years

Aboitiz InfraCapital has a clearer path forward as we head 

into 2021. While the pandemic impacted mobility and key 

industries including transport and retail, it presents a huge 

opportunity for digital infrastructure initiatives and the 

integrated economic centers to play key roles in the country’s 

economic recovery and sustainability. Water also remains a 

vital need for growing communities all over the country.

 

 

Our sights are set for the next 10 years. We will build on our 

water portfolio, further explore the exciting opportunities in 

digital infrastructure, pursue our transport projects, including 

our airport proposals, and expand our IECs. With our renewed 

focus and the support of our team members, we are confident 

that Aboitiz InfraCapital can steadily grow in 2021 and beyond.

At the start of 2020, the lives of residents of 

Calabarzon Region and Metro Manila were 

disrupted by the eruption of Taal Volcano, 

which resulted in damage to property, 

forced evacuations, suspension of work, 

classes, and flights, and worse, more than 30 

deaths.

At LIMA Estate, which is about 20 kilometers 

from the volcano, industrial operations 

were temporarily ceased the day after the 

eruption to give way to facility clearing 

activities. While we were focused on quickly 

resuming normal operations, LIMA Land 

coordinated relief efforts for affected team 

members and communities.

In partnership with Aboitiz Foundation 

and its locators, LIMA Land donated relief 

goods, alcohol, and N95 masks to our eight 

host barangays in Lipa and Malvar who also 

received evacuees from other towns (i.e San 

Lucas, Plaridel, Bugtong na Pulo, San Andres, 

San Fernando, Bagong Pook, Santiago, and

#OneAboitiz in Apo Agua

Apo Agua is the Aboitiz Group’s first major 

infrastructure project, which was made possible 

in 2015 through the government’s Public-Private 

Partnership (PPP) program. Slated to become one 

of the country’s biggest bulk water supply and 

treatment facilities, Apo Agua is projected to supply 

over 300 million liters of treated water daily to over 

1.5 million Davaoeños.

But even before we are operational, Apo Agua is 

already delivering value to our host communities. 

Apart from our numerous Corporate Social 

Responsibility programs that include Scholarship 

Programs, Donations, and our Watershed 

Rehabilitation Partnership with the Davao City 

Water District, our business operations also result in 

indirect positive benefits. Most especially for Purok 

Maligatong in Barangay Tawantawan, the area where 

our intake weir is located.

In 2019, the road leading to the intake weir was 

improved and widened by our contractor, JVACC, 

to allow heavy equipment to access the area. Since 

then, it has been easier for the purok’s residents and 

visitors to travel to and from the main road.

Additionally, to be able to use electricity during 

our construction and operations phase, we also 

needed to connect the intake weir to Davao Light. 

As a result, in July 2020, electric poles were erected 

to reach Purok Maligatong. The electric poles were 

paid for by Davao Light as part of their energization 

program, while Apo Agua facilitated to manage the

impacts to the communities in the activities carried 

out by Davao Light. Purok Maligatong residents 

can now apply to be energized and connected to 

the grid, an option they never had before, and also 

apply with the barangay to set up street lights. 

“As someone who has been involved since its 

conceptualization, negotiation, up to the execution, 

it was very fulfilling for me to see how this project 

has materialized. Living up to our purpose to drive 

change for a better world by advancing business 

and communities, the Aboitiz Group is committed 

and true to its promise of improving the lives of the 

people at Sitio Maligatong through making way for 

an accessible, affordable and reliable power,” said 

Jeryl Regulacion, Apo Agua Technical Engineer.

The residents in the area have also benefited from 

employment opportunities. Our contractor has 

hired local residents as watchmen to help ensure

safety during the construction phase. Apo Agua

also looks at the possibility to offer the residents 

to be watchmen and guards of the area once we 

become operational.

Indeed, Apo Agua’s benefits go beyond supplying 

water for the residents of Davao City. It also 

spurs development in the area that will help the 

community grow in the long-term, enabled

by #OneAboitiz.

Republic Cement launches ecoloop:

Co-processing solution to address

PH waste crisis 

In 2020, our cement business and leading local cement 

manufacturing and distribution company Republic 

Cement officially launched ecoloop, its resource recovery 

group that aims to help address the waste management 

crisis of the country.

Co-processing is the reuse or recovery of thermal and 

mineral properties of qualified waste materials while 

manufacturing cement in a single combined operation. 

Through co-processing and the use of waste, such as 

plastic or rice husk, as alternative fuels, Republic can 

manufacture cement with reduced dependence on fossil 

fuels, such as coal. 

Co-processing continues to be a sustainable solution to 

the rise in the country’s waste generation, which remains 

a major challenge even with the Ecological Solid Waste 

Management Act (RA No. 9003) in place. The country has 

observed a steady increase in daily waste generated over 

the years, from over 37,000 tons in 2012 to 40,000 tons 

in 2016. In 2018, Metro Manila recorded an average of 

over 9,000 tons of waste per day. Whereas 85 percent of 

the total solid wastes were collected, 15 percent ended 

up in waterways and bodies of water. 

An alternative waste management system is of utmost 

priority and as such, we have taken the opportunity 

to share the technology and innovation it has been 

using since the early 2000s for wider scope and greater 

nationwide impact. “Co-processing is a vital alternative 

that manufacturing industries can and should take 

toward the long-term goals of waste management 

as well as ultimately building our nation’s resilience 

against climate change challenges through sustainable 

practices,” said Angela Edralin-Valencia, ecoloop Director.





ABC Stories



With ecoloop, residual wastes can effectively be

diverted away from landfills and waterways, and the 

plastic pollution crisis can also be addressed by capturing 

pre- and post-consumer waste in direct partnership with 

manufacturers including fast-moving consumer goods 

(FMCG) companies as well as local government units 

(LGUs). At present, ecoloop counts more than 30 public 

and private partnerships across the country. “As long as 

these wastes are deemed acceptable for co-processing 

and acceptable under the guidelines issued by the 

Department of Environment and Natural Resources 

(DENR) through DAO 2010-6, co-processing should be 

prioritized over other unsustainable disposal methods 

that are more harmful to the environment in the long 

run,” adds Valencia.

While co-processing involves the application of heat

to destroy waste, it is distinct from the traditional

waste management practice of incineration

 according to Valencia. ecoloop utilizes the cement

kiln co-processing method, where emissions are 

contained and managed within the kiln and any ash 

produced fully integrated into the stable microstructure 

of clinker, a key ingredient of cement. On the other 

hand, some forms of incineration are purely for waste 

disposal without any energy or material recovery 

aspects. “There is a higher chance of noxious gases 

being released into the atmosphere and the ash 

byproduct usually still ends up in landfills,”

explains Valencia. 

Further, co-processing promotes the conservation of 

non-renewable energy sources and raw materials. 

The recovered heat content from the qualified wastes 

partially replaces the heat from traditional fossil fuels 

such as coal and petcoke. Recovered minerals similar 

to the chemical composition of sand and clay also 

replace raw materials used in cement production.

“In the waste management hierarchy, methods 

such as prevention, minimization, and recovery 

of materials through recycling and reusing are 

still preferred over co-processing. However, when 

these options are no longer available, co-processing 

remains preferred over unsustainable methods such 

as incineration, chemical and physical treatment of 

waste, and landfilling,” adds Valencia.

“Republic is proud to do its part in providing a viable 

waste management solution while continuously 

working towards a greener and more sustainable 

cement manufacturing process. Through this 

initiative, we are confident that we are on the right 

path in moving towards a greener, stronger Republic,” 

said Nabil Francis, Republic Cement CEO.

Result of Operations

AboitizLand’s story in 2020 has been 

that of resilience and innovation. We 

weathered the harshest impact of the 

pandemic to the business by maintaining 

an agile, innovative mindset and 

staying attuned to the evolving needs 

of the market and our vecinos. This 

focus on innovation is the same spirit 

that will see us through as, together 

with #OneAboitiz, we recover from the 

COVID-19 crisis and bring AboitizLand to 

better heights in 2021 and beyond.

“

”

For AboitizLand and many other companies in 

all industries across the globe, 2020 was a year 

of disruptions. We began the year facing the 

challenges brought about by the eruption of 

Taal Volcano and managing its impact on LIMA, 

our integrated economic center located in Lipa-

Malvar, Batangas, and its residential component, 

The Villages at Lipa.

The rest of the year would be riddled with more 

challenges, such as the series of typhoons, 

which battered and flooded the country in the 

last quarter of the year, with our developments 

in Batangas and Central Luzon along the storm 

path.  But no calamity had a bigger and more 

damaging impact than the health and economic 

crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), 

which began in March 2020 forced the 

lockdown of businesses across the country, 

severely impacting all aspects of AboitizLand’s 

operations. OFW remittances, long since one 

of the key drivers for the property industry, 

drastically dipped as thousands of overseas 

workers lost their jobs and had to be repatriated. 

Unemployed and out-of-business Filipinos 

struggled to make their loan payments, even 

after several rounds of moratoriums extended by 

businesses, and the impact was immediately felt, 

as our revenue collections took a dip. Overall 

consumer confidence was extremely low and the 

business outlook was bleak.



Managing the pandemic impact through

a quick pivot to digitalization

As the rest of the country was reeling from the 

sudden halt of business, AboitizLand began 

mobilizing towards a quick pivot to innovative 

measures to ensure business continuity.

AboitizLand introduced its contactless 

homebuying service just a few weeks after the 

enhanced community quarantine was enforced in 

March. Sensing Filipinos’ urgent need for a good 

home to serve as a sanctuary for themselves and 

their family during the pandemic, we were one of 

the first developers to respond by taking our sales 

and marketing operations online and offering 

end-to-end, digital-based homebuying. 

From property viewing to unit reservation, 

we made the entire home acquisition process 

possible through our digital platforms.

Aside from providing our customers with safer 

options to conduct their home buying journey, 

we also made sure our sales force embraced the 

digital approach to selling through innovative 

tools, training programs, and incentives. As a 

result, we began to see our reservation sales 

levels recover and even exceed pre-pandemic 

levels in July of 2020. We were able to sustain 

the sales momentum towards the end of the 

year, posting 130% gross reservation sales 

versus budget, with our conversion-to-booked 

sales rate also surpassing expectations.

Similarly in construction, the series of community quarantines took 

a toll on our ability to construct and deliver houses to our vecinos on 

time. For a few critical weeks, operations completely halted as supply 

chain challenges also mounted.

As authorities began loosening their restrictions, we quickly adapted 

to the new normal through the strict implementation of the return-to-

work playbook, as we also ensured compliance with DOLE and DOH 

safety protocols as early as April 2020. We aggressively implemented 

plans to compensate for weeks of lost hours of operations by 

ramping up house awards through enhanced standard procurement 

procedures. The construction teams made full use of Agora, the 

internal digital communications tool in the Aboitiz Group, which 

became an effective platform to manage progress and performance in 

our project sites across Luzon and Cebu.

We also turned to digital platforms to ensure our targets for collections 

were met. The house turnovers were initially hampered by our 

vecinos’ inability to personally accept their units, whether through 

travel restrictions or due to concerns for their safety. We worked 

around these limitations by offering virtual house acceptance sessions. 

With a 96% acceptance rate at the first meeting, our new homeowners 

appreciated how we have turned a traditionally in-person milestone 

into a virtual, safe, and efficient experience for them.

Amidst continuously evolving and mounting operational limitations 

and low consumer confidence at a time of a raging pandemic, 

AboitizLand showed how an organization’s agile and innovative 

mindset is key to its survival and success in the face of challenges.

A closer focus on the residential business

Agility and innovation played a hand in the strategic decision to 

integrate our industrial and commercial business units into Aboitiz 

InfraCapital in the third quarter of 2020. The move supports the 

Aboitiz Group’s vision of ramping up the growth of our integrated 

economic centers, while at the same time putting a more focused 

approach to the residential business.

Even in the face of an unprecedented health and economic crisis, the 

property market remains resilient, with the large unmet demand for 

housing as its main driver.  It also continues to be highly competitive, 

as Filipinos grow more discerning about what they need and want 

for their homes. In addition, AboitizLand sits on approximately PHP4 

billion in collectible value, as well as PHP24 billion worth of unlocked 

value in unlaunched inventories and landbank. 

This renewed focus on the residential business enables us to deliver 

maximum value and growth, as we navigate the uncertain post-

pandemic market landscape. AboitizLand will continue to improve 



operational efficiency in constant pursuit to 

be a stronger residential developer brand.

Shifting market preferences

Before the pandemic, people in the suburbs 

and provinces naturally flock to the major 

urban centers with their high concentration 

of career and business opportunities. 

However, COVID-19 has made these 

megacities highly vulnerable, as social 

distancing and health protocols brought to 

light an urgent need for better living spaces.

After a few months of complying with 

shelter-in-place protocols, Filipinos have 

developed a renewed appreciation for a good 

home. Property industry watchers reported 

a growing shift in homeseekers’ preferences 

towards houses and lots in next-wave cities, 

as bigger living areas, open spaces, and 

amenities take priority. Online modes of 

working, conducting business, and learning 

have made it possible to choose to live in 

locations far away from central business 

districts.

AboitizLand’s residential developments, 

located in emerging growth centers in 

Central Luzon, Batangas, and Cebu, are far 

enough from the congestion and noise of 

the metropolis yet close enough to be able 

to drive to the familiar sights and sounds of 

the city. Our master planned developments, 

boasting of less density and more open 

spaces and amenities also answer the 

market’s renewed need for developments 

that offer better work-life balance and 

access to creature comforts. In the third 

quarter of 2020, we ramped up our sales 

and marketing efforts in order to capitalize 

on these trends that are now favoring our 

developments, harnessing our digital tools 

and platforms to reach as many of our 

potential customers as possible.

As the real estate market moves into 

recovery, experts say these new property 

trends are here to stay. Buoyed by the 

government’s moves to decongest the 

city centers and funnel growth into the 

countryside, as well as the continued 

infrastructure developments connecting 

these centers with new-wave cities in the 

provinces, the outlook for AboitizLand’s 

properties is rosy. We have full confidence 

that our mission to create better ways 

to live through our thoughtfully planned 

communities is resonating more and more 

with an increasingly discerning market.

A bullish outlook for 2021 and beyond

Though 2021 still presents as much 

uncertainty as the past year, AboitizLand 

enters its next 25 years with a hopeful

outlook and a clear path forward. 

In 2021, we expect to post a 203% increase 

in bottomline, with double digit growth 

anticipated in revenue, gross profit, and 

net operating profit versus last year. This 

will be largely driven by stronger house 

completion from previous years and the 

robust sales generated in 2020.

We also look to contributing capital to 

the Aboitiz Group by spearheading the 

monetization of its land assets.

Operational excellence will be a major 

focus for 2021, as we embark on a strategic 

shift in our culture in critical areas.

AboitizLand will continue to sharpen its 

results-driven culture. This involves the 

organization-wide ownership of wildly 

important business critical goals, and 

creating a cadence of accountability 

focused on rapid and sharp execution of 

goals. It is a culture of performance and 

execution that thrives on helping each 

other succeed.

We plan to put a renewed focus on our 

customers and continue to embark on our 

digital transformation journey, a major 

goal of which is to enhance the customer 

experience. Our process and technological 

changes are all focused on meeting and 

exceeding customer expectations. 

We look ahead to fostering stronger 

organizational cohesion as we adapt an 

agile work system. Our team members 

will be able to work from anywhere, have 

a strong mentorship program to support 

their growth, and engage in meaningful 

creation of communities that nurture 

families and the environment.

We will take the lessons of 2020, and 

continue our digital transformation 

journey which will significantly enhance 

our efficiencies in the major areas of 

sales and marketing, construction, and 

collections.

We will maintain a de-risking approach 

by continuously revisiting our inventory 

mix and ensuring it is attuned to market 

demand. From the onset of project 

planning, our sites and lot cuts are made 

flexible so that our product mix and 

portfolio remain diverse and responsive to 

market needs. As a result, target velocity 

is achieved or even exceeded, margins are 

protected, and capital risk is reduced.

With renewed focus, and with the spirit 

of innovation buoying forward a cohesive 

AboitizLand team, we look ahead to 

fulfilling our promise of creating better 

ways to live for more Filipino families.

ABC Story

Eco-sensitive planning

Guided by our vision of creating better ways 

to live, AboitizLand believes that nature and 

its inhabitants must be protected to promote 

good quality of life for all.

In our third year of partnership with Aboitiz 

Foundation, the Department of Environmental 

and Natural Resources (DENR) and the 

University of the Philippines Diliman Institute 

of Environmental Science and Meteorology, 

we continue to work on the Pawikan 

Conservation Project, a five-year management 

plan to preserve sea turtle nesting sites at 

Seafront Residences in Barangay Calubcub II, 

San Juan, Batangas.

Tagged by the DENR as prime nesting grounds 

for the endangered olive ridley sea turtles, our 

43-hectare beachside development and its 

shoreline is home to several nests every year. 

As of December 2020, we have successfully 

released 1,246 hatchlings back into the ocean 

since the program started in 2018.

After three years of implementation, we have 

completed research and profiling of the sea 

turtles and their nesting sites, categorizing 

Barangay Calubcub II into beach zones to 





identify and evaluate safe areas. Together with the 

local government, a capacity development training 

was also conducted to engage locals residing in 

nearby towns. Pawikan Beach Patrol participants 

were also oriented to ensure efficient and effective 

implementation of the program.

For the next two years, we will be focusing on 

strategy evaluation and improvement as well as 

facilities enhancement. In partnership with various 

government agencies, local government units, and 

non-government organizations, we are looking 

forward to the installation of an automated weather 

station (AWS) at the site which will provide us with 

data-driven information on rainfall, wind speed and 

direction, air temperature, and other physical 

parameters of the ocean that may affect the sea 

turtles.

Through this initiative, we remain committed to 

environment-sensitive planning while delivering 

sustainable developments and homes that may be 

passed onto future generations.



Target 14.2 Sustainably manage and 

protect marine and coastal ecosystems to 

avoid significant adverse impacts, including 

by strengthening their resilience, and take 

action for their restoration in order to 

achieve healthy and productive oceans 

The beach along Seafront Residences in San Juan, Batangas is also a nesting ground for endangered olive ridley sea turtles.

Responding to the challenges of the

COVID-19 era

As individuals, organizations, and communities 

around the world rethink their way of life 

and choices as a result of the pandemic, we 

found ourselves asking the same question of 

purpose: how can we make a more significant 

contribution to the communities we serve?

 

The Philippines continues to be hammered by 

COVID-19, ranking second in Southeast Asia 

for the highest number of confirmed cases 

and deaths. It strained our healthcare system, 

exposing decades-old problems in service 

delivery, manpower and funding. But beyond 

the case numbers, the impact of COVID-19 

rippled across the everyday life of Filipinos. 

 

Self-rated hunger is at its highest since 2014 

as a result of job losses or underemployment. 

Five million or 14.6% of the labor force were 

either let go by their employers or had to look 

for additional work to meet their basic needs. 

In the education sector, enrollment dropped 

to 89% in both public and private schools 

combined, which means 2.3 million students 

are out of school. In urban areas where a large 

population sees a higher rate of transmission, 

the urban poor is disproportionately affected 

— facing hunger, joblessness, lack of access to 

basic services, and threats to their safety.

COVID-19 has challenged the status quo of 

corporate social responsibility. 

Maribeth L. Marasigan

President and COO

Aboitiz Foundation

Today, we are humbled and grateful to celebrate 100 years 

of hard-earned wins – only this time, we are celebrating 

free of formalities and fancies and with a renewed sense 

of purpose to drive change for a better world. The call to 

do good has never been greater than it is today. For us in 

the Aboitiz Foundation, the last 32 years prepared us for 

a time such as this.  While we are grateful to have been 

given the privilege to help thousands of individuals and 

communities, there is much work to be done. Filipinos 

will always wear a smile come rain or shine, mask or no 

mask. But we would rather see them smiling confidently 

because they are prepared to overcome challenges. This is 

why we remain committed to co-creating safe, empowered 

and sustainable communities. It is always about progress 

achieved not by one, but many – not in a day, but 

throughout generations to come. 

“

Corporate Social Responsibility

Result of Operations



In 2020, three themes stood out that prompted 

us to rethink our strategy: 

 

The need to address the digital divide.

Before COVID-19, the poorest 40% of 

households in the Philippines have the lowest 

access to televisions, radios, mobile phones, 

and computers. Only 4.35% of this group 

have a computer at home. Low digital literacy 

and lack of access to technology created 

undesirable conditions in the delivery

of social services, such as distance learning for 

students. 

Greater focus on inclusive recovery. 

We are uniquely positioned to not just serve 

the community as a whole, but also focus on 

tailoring programs for vulnerable groups such 

as women, children, persons with disabilities,

and the elderly. Beyond demographics, there is 

also a need to help micro and small businesses 

to find ways to stay afloat especially during 

these hard times.

 

Underpin resiliency like never before.

Resilience is more than just having a positive 

outlook — it is having the ability to prepare 

ahead and use resources to respond to, 

endure, and bounce back from unfavorable 

situations. Disasters have taught us time and 

again that having a cohesive response and plan 

of action enable our communities to move the 

needle between wreck to recovery.

CSR parameters and our success measures

We continue to be guided by our CSR 2.0 parameters to ensure 

that we achieve inclusive impact. These parameters include the 

alignment with the Group’s core businesses and the Foundation’s 

program pillars, scalability, team member engagement, and 

provision of long-term benefits for our partner-communities.

In 2020, we focused our efforts in providing immediate support to 

the COVID-19 response, especially in providing our frontliners with 

personal protective equipment and families needing assistance 

with relief goods. We also made a PHP100 million donation through 

the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation’s  Project Ugnayan, 

which aims to provide assistance by distributing grocery vouchers. 

This shifted our CSR 2.0 projects from 41% last year to 15% in 2020. 

Total funds provided by Aboitiz Foundation alone for COVID-19 

response reached PHP189 million, which comprises the majority of 

our CSR 1.0 allocation.

COVID-19 funds allocated by Aboitiz Foundation in 2020

Aside from COVID-19, natural disasters have also impacted the 

Philippines. While we have had very strong disaster response 

efforts in the previous years, the ongoing pandemic has made it 

twice as challenging in 2020.

Due to the community lockdown brought by the pandemic, helping from 

home was made possible by the crowdfunding platform, KINDer by Aboitiz. 

Online donation served as the most convenient way to extend a helping hand 

to the communities in need.

We believe that we can help in many ways. Through supporting other 

organizations in raising their funds through KINDer we strengthen collaboration 

and widen resource mobilization.

iCSR: #OneAboitiz in action

As the organization’s movements were 

limited due to the pandemic, the Integrated 

Corporate Social Responsibility (ICSR) 

focused its efforts in ensuring that the 

projects per island region co-implemented 

by the Regional Councils, were in full swing. 

In Luzon, the business units through its 

integrated project, “Collaboration Towards 

Disaster Resilience,” conducted relief 

operations to communities in Northern 

Luzon affected by Typhoon Ulysses and in 

Bicol Region affected by typhoon Rolly. 

ICSR Luzon members organized to provide 

food needs, shelter repair and assistance

in re-energization. 

In the Visayas, the Regional Council focused 

its resources in responding to the COVID-19 

pandemic, spearheading the relief efforts 

in Cebu and providing extended assistance 

to frontliners and patients in Cebu 

City’s quarantine centers, ensuring their 

immediate needs were addressed. 

And finally, the Mindanao iCSR Cacao 

Agribusiness Project directed its efforts 

towards strengthening the Apo Farmers 

Multipurpose Cooperative (AFAMULCO) 

through mentoring on financial management 

and record keeping, and membership 

management. The adopted community, 

which is composed of the Bagobo Klata 

Indigenous People, were also provided other 

livelihoods to augment income from cacao 

such as egg-laying machines and assistance 

in linking to markets for their fruit produce. 

This effort was  joined by 9 Mindanao-based 

BUs.

Education

Aboitiz Foundation believes that education 

is an essential sector that must continue 

amidst the pandemic.  Its disruption on 

access to education has encouraged the 

innovation of digital solutions, leading 

to the development of online platforms 

and activities to keep the Aboitiz scholars 

engaged and informed.  These innovations 

enhanced the existing education programs, 

and more importantly, ensured continued 

access to education in the time of COVID-19.



Keeping our scholars connected even 

from a distance is a priority. In 2020, 

the Aboitiz Scholarship Microsite was 

launched. It is a one-stop scholarship 

•

hub created exclusively for our scholars nationwide. This app is easily 

accessible to all scholars nationwide. It contains features such as updating their 

profile, an advisory page where they can access the latest announcements and 

guidelines, and e-learning page where they can access webinars and modules 

that will help them cope with the new normal.

Holistic support is also important for the scholars in these trying the times. 

Aside from the financial assistance, scholars and other education stakeholders 

also need to be guided on how to navigate in the new normal. To attain holistic 

support, Aboitiz Beyond Classrooms (ABC) was put into place. ABC is a virtual 

learning series which serves as a platform that combines all virtual learning 

activities targeting various education stakeholders. The learning sessions keep 

the scholars informed of topics that are relevant to them, and keep them 

engaged through conversations with guest speakers and the Aboitiz Foundation 

project team.

As we fully embrace digital transformation in the new normal, the Aboitiz 

Scholarship Application Portal was launched. It is an online application system 

which moves the annual recruitment process from manual to online. The 

system allowed applicants to apply for the scholarship in just a few clicks, 

and significantly reduced man hours in terms of screening and reviewing the 

applications.

Enterprise Development

We aim to support our partner cooperatives and MSMEs nationwide 

to restart their operation and recover from the economic loss and 

failure brought about by the pandemic. Supporting cooperatives and 

MSMEs is vital for preserving jobs and productivity. This also includes 

helping them take advantage of the use of digital tools to continue 

operating their businesses and providing services to cooperative 

members.

Implemented Digital Coops in partnership with UnionBank’s 

GlobalLinker and DTI, transforming our coop-partners into digital 

coops so they can take advantage of emerging opportunities 

in e-commerce. The project assisted cooperatives and MSMEs 

to utilize digital technology for their businesses, specifically 

for banking transactions, member transactions, e-commerce 

and e-learning. These were conducted through online training 

and mentoring sessions, assistance in applying for and utilizing 

banking products, e-commerce platforms and e-learning portals. 

Provided [re]start support to help communities recover their 

livelihoods that were affected by COVID-19. Our partner 

cooperatives/MSMEs received “re-starter” kits such as farm 

inputs, bakery package and egg laying machine that will help 

their organization to recover from economic loss and can 

provide employment opportunities to the community members. 

The project was implemented in close partnership with the 

different Aboitiz Business Units where partner cooperatives are 

located and in collaboration with different government agencies, 

NGOs, and private entities. The framework of the Restart 

Program is aligned with the recovery plan of the government 

which includes financial or capital assistance, supply chain and 

market linkages for new business, business diversification or 

reinvention and skills development, and retooling. At the end 

of the project, partner cooperatives have used the restarter 

packages to restart their businesses. They have also accessed 

financing or acquired new skills and suppliers/buyers to help 

recover their businesses.  

Launched the Community Marketplace Microsite which 

supported the cooperatives in marketing their products online. 

This is a one-stop shop where Aboitiz team members can access 

or avail the products and services of our supported communities 

nationwide. 

Conducted E-learning Seminars on Cooperative Strengthening, 

and Business Continuity Planning and Disaster Risk Reduction, 

in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Cooperative 

Development Authority, and Go Negosyo which benefited 

264 participants in 9 organizations nationwide. The training 

conducted aims to strengthen and enhance the management 

leadership skills of our partner organizations/communities.

Environment

Our Environment program ensures that 

projects undertaken directly or through 

partnerships will maintain and enhance the 

benefits of ecosystem services, build resilient 

communities, and promote an environment-

friendly transport system. 

A-Park. In line with the extension of the 

DENR’s Enhanced National Greening Program 

to 2028, which aims to revitalize what it cited 

as “the remaining unproductive, denuded, 

and degraded forestlands nationwide through 

reforestation initiatives,” Aboitiz Group has 

transcended its target to plant 9-million 

trees by 2020. As of December 31, 2020, 

there were 11.73-million trees planted, in 

partnership with the tree growing project 

of Ramon Aboitiz Foundation, Inc., the 

Philippine Business for Social Progress, and 

the Carbon Sink Management Program of 

Therma South, Inc. and Therma Visayas, Inc.

Aboitiz Cleanergy Park. In 2020, Aboitiz 

Cleanergy Park was cited as a birdwatching 

haven according to a local expert, with 

its wide variety of animal habitat types 

combined with the area’s relative isolation 

and secure environment. The eight-hectare 

park showcases a mangrove reforestation 

site, nursery, and botanical garden for the 

propagation of 29 natives tree species 

and is home to 100 species of birds. Since 

2014, the park has already released more 

than 4,939 hawksbill hatchlings, planted 

13,992 mangrove propagules, and rescued 

16 pawikans (sea turtles).

Balabag Wetland Park (Wetland 4). 

Even with the onset of the pandemic, 

rehabilitation efforts continued for the 

Balabag Wetland Park (Wetland 4) in 

Boracay, Aklan. The turnover was set for 

2021 which saw the conversion of the 

whole area to an urban linear park, along 

with these enhancements: 

Installed 5 aerators to improve the 

water quality.

Installed 3D Boracay signage which 

tourists and locals can use for social 

media photo-ops.

Completed the community center

which serves as an activity area

(in front of D’Mall).

Completed the perimeter landscaping 

and pavers in  the whole area for 

visitors to walk around and interact 

with nature.

Completed the parking area for visitors’ 

proper loading and unloading area.

San Juan River Rehabilitation. 

In partnership with DENR, the 

#WOWSanJuanRiver program or the San 

Juan River (Manila Bay) Rehabilitation 

Project has continuously conducted 

stakeholder engagement initiatives 

involving different government agencies 

in the development of a working 

framework, and a model for other Manila 

Bay tributaries. Part of the pipelined 

activities with the community is the eco-

hub, the purchase of trash traps, and a 

small boat to clear areas and sections of 

the river.

Calubcub II: Pawikan Conservation

(Year 3). AboitizLand, in partnership with

UP Diliman-Institute of Environmental 

Science and Meteorology, achieved 

the company’s goals in setting up the 

facilities for the Pawikan Conservation 

in Brgy. Calubcub, Batangas. The group 

continues to research and monitor 

environmental impacts, conduct 

conservation operations, capacity-

building, and Information, Education and 

Communication (IEC) activities within the 

supported locality. And as of end-2020, 

a total of 1,181 pawikan hatchlings were 

released in Seafront, Batangas.

The first fully electric, free ride shuttle 

service in Mindanao was launched in Davao 

City on December 11, 2020. The BEST Bus 

(Business for Environmentally Sustainable 

Transformation) has a seating capacity 

of 30 persons but can only accommodate 

15 passengers, in observance of the 

physical distancing, to curb the coronavirus 

transmission. The BEST bus would provide 

a safer and more convenient transport 

experience and bring Davao City closer to a 

more sustainable future.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an 

upheaval in social and economic life across 

the country and the most severely affected 

are the MSMEs. For these businesses to 

survive, they must be able to adapt their 

operations to the new environment. As 

such, we conducted a blended e-learning 

program on DRRM and Business Continuity 

Planning for the 99 participants of the 

Department of Agriculture - Philippine Rural 

Development Project. Business continuity 

planning is a component of building 

business resilience in normal times and is 

especially critical in cases of large disasters 

like the pandemic. 



Creating resilient, empowered, and sustainable communities

 

As the pandemic left no community unaffected, our focus on resilience is 

anchored on the need to find solutions that will protect the communities we 

serve from the crippling impact of disasters. The United Nations expounds on 

this: “Resilience is about anticipating, planning and reducing disaster risk to 

effectively protect persons, communities and countries, their livelihoods, health, 

cultural heritage, socio-economic assets, and ecosystems.”

 

Aboitiz Foundation’s long term vision and aspiration is aligned with the 

government’s Ambisyon Natin 2040 – which envisions families that thrive in 

vibrant, culturally diverse, and resilient communities. While that may still be a 

long way to go, we commit to begin the work now. For 2021, we direct our focus 

on these four key strategies:





Integrate resiliency as a goal and framework.

We will consider all the dimensions where we can help prepare and 

equip individuals and communities we work with; in facing social and 

economic disruptions.

 

Use digital technology in CSR programming.

We will help bridge the gap for individuals and communities struggling 

with access and use of technology. Our programs will help accelerate 

technology adoption for students, educators, and other members of the 

community; and assist micro and small businesses to use e-commerce 

platforms to keep their livelihood thriving.

 

Increase core business interventions.

Our work in the past three decades in the education, environment, 

and enterprise development sectors helped establish the portfolio 

of competencies that we have today as a foundation. We have also 

created trusted relationships in the communities we work with, and 

strong ties with partners in the public and private sectors. There is no 

greater time than now to ramp up our core work in these sectors, and 

sustain the momentum of the programs we’ve built.

 

Scale up social impact.

Our core value of teamwork will always guide how we collaborate in 

projects with the many business units across the Aboitiz Group. Our 

people on the ground know best — and as a team, we will create and 

scale up smart, localized solutions that will yield immediate positive 

results, where it matters.

We are writing this report at such a time when Filipinos eagerly await for 

vaccination to begin. A remarkable year has taught us to review the path we 

charted ourselves to conquer, both as individuals and as an organization. 

2020 is also a year that cemented the Foundation’s mission to enable more 

communities to be resilient — bouncing back from adversities because they 

can; empowered — leveraging technology to create opportunities to thrive; 

and sustainable — conscious of the finite yet accessible natural resources, 

and embracing environment-friendly practices.

Aboitiz-supported coop hits PHP100M in assets,

gives back to community amid COVID-19

Months before its December 2020 target, Benguet-based 

Thanksgiving Multi-purpose Cooperative (TMPC) hits 

‘Php100 million in assets’, thanks to the support of the 

Aboitiz Group.

What was once a small all-women cooperative with an 

initial membership of 22 and a starting capital of only Php 

102,500 has now become an 800-strong membership that 

owns a total asset of over PHP100 million, including its 

four-story building along Camp 6, Kennon Road in Tuba, 

Benguet – a notable milestone amid the challenges brought 

about by the COVID-19 pandemic.

TMPC is a multi-business cooperative that offers loans, 

savings, and time deposits, as well as miscellaneous 

services such as photocopying and bookbinding.  In 

collaboration with Hedcor and Pilmico, we provided 

financial assistance, capacity-building, as well as livelihood 

skills training for its members such as dressmaking and 

baking, among others.

The restrictions of the health crisis saw TMPC’s loan 

applications and payments decline as cooperative members 

opted not to apply due to payment uncertainties as the 

majority of them were unable to work upon the imposition 

of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) in the area. 

However, these restrictions soon became opportunities 

as the ECQ prevented other bread suppliers from entering 

their community. As the only bakery operating in the area, 

the TMPC bakery operates day and night to meet the 

demands of the community. This has brought their income 

to a 117% increase in terms of sales from the month of 

March and April, compared to  January and February of 

the same year. Their grocery store also saw a 50% sales 

increase despite the ECQ.

ABC Story







“Thank you for donating our starter kits for our 

dressmaking and bakery business which we now 

enjoy and very much in demand in this time of the 

pandemic. Again, the officers and members of the 

Thanksgiving Multi-Purpose Cooperative are very 

much privileged to be one of your chosen partners 

in fulfilling your Corporate Social Responsibility 

(CSR). Without the support extended to us by Aboitiz 

Foundation, HEDCOR, and Pilmico, we will not be able 

to reach our status today, a large cooperative with an 

asset of over Php100M,” said  Emma Golocan, General 

Manager of TMPC.

Giving back to the community 

 

With the success of TMPC, the cooperative pays it 

forward by giving back to the communities it serves. 

Recently, the cooperative conducted a relief operation 

in the affected areas of COVID-19.

“What sets us apart from other cooperatives is 

perhaps our belief that ‘in giving, you shall receive’. 

TMPC donates 10% of its annual net income to the 

church since the beginning of its operation in 1993. 

This is a true testament to our faith in the Almighty 

and with all the unending support of our partner 

agencies, the officers, and the members, I can say that 

we made it all possible for TMPC to be where we are 

now,” Golocan added.

TMPC also conducts regular medical and dental 

missions, participates in community clean-up 

drives, implements tree planting activities, initiates 

Brigada Eskwela every start of the school year, and 

other similar initiatives. 

“With all of us working together, we can make 

more self-reliant organizations like TMPC – able to 

firmly stand on their own, grow their businesses, 

and in their own inspiring ways, contribute to 

co-creating safe, empowered, and sustainable 

communities,” said Maribeth L. Marasigan, Aboitiz 

Foundation President and Chief Operating Officer.

Through our enterprise development program, 

we empower cooperative members with effective 

organizational management and technical skills, 

financial and infrastructure support, and access 

to the market to help grow and expand their 

business. Since its inception, this program has 

benefited over 53 cooperatives with nearly 16,000 

members as of 2019.

Strengthening Sustainability Leadership

In the 100 years of Aboitiz Group, the singular 

thread that has connected our past and present 

is our commitment to leading our business on a 

sustainable path. Our sustainability journey is guided 

by strong leadership that promotes the continuous 

improvement of our environmental, social, and 

governance (ESG) performance. The year 2020 

tested our resilience as the COVID-19 pandemic 

compounded the impact of natural calamities that 

afflicted the country such as typhoons and the Taal 

Volcano eruption, which devastated communities in 

the Southern Tagalog region. Guided by our time-

honored values of integrity, teamwork, innovation, 

and responsibility, we mobilized sound risk 

management systems and took advantage of early 

investments in digital transformation in facing the 

challenges of a volatile time in our  history.

Our commitment to sustainability is demonstrated 

through our brand promise of advancing business 

In order to deliver our ESG strategies, we continuously redefine our leadership funcctions and 

responsibilities to strengthen the Aboitiz Group’s ESG work plans and performance targets. 

and communities. As our business grows, our 

stakeholder communities should equally gain. 

We define sustainable development as inclusive 

growth that looks into the dimensions of ESG:

Environment - Conscious of our limited resources, 

the Aboitiz Group minimizes competition for the 

communities we operate, and ensures that these 

can be replenished for future generations.

Social - The Aboitiz Group understands the basic 

premise that no business shall succeed in failing 

communities. As such, we implement sound 

labor practices in the workforce and responsible 

operations in our host communities.

Governance - The Aboitiz Group operates and 

manages the interest of its stakeholders, including 

checks and balances, that enable the Board of 

Directors to exercise appropriate control and 

oversight responsibilities on the environmental and 

social aspects of the business.

We are following this simple equation:

The Aboitiz Group Sustainability Policy

and Framework

We can do well by doing good, always making the 

right long-term decisions that balance the interests 

of people, planet, and profit. We are committed to 

a mindset that views sustainability not as a cost of 

doing business, but as a way of doing good business. 

Sustainability is an integral part of our business 

strategy. We focus on three key areas where the 

ESG dimensions are present – our triple bottom 

line approach of people, planet, and profit. 

This framework is used to set targets, improve 

performance, and extend the scope of the value it 

creates. Our ESG performance targets are included 

in each group’s accountability and responsibility. 

In 2020, team members’ performance appraisals 

included a portion for ESG compliance and delivery.

We communicate our Sustainability Policy and 

Framework to our shareholders, employees, 

vendors, and customers through our various 

communication platforms. For more information

Our Value Creation Business Model

We believe that we make the most value to our stakeholders by strengthening our value chains, 

transforming the business landscape through innovation, and empower societies by having equitable 

business practices through contributing positive economic value that improves quality of life.  

Our Group Strategic Pillars

Our SBUs align to the Aboitiz Group’s strategic pillars, 

namely: grow the business, stakeholder engagement, 

build human capital, and execution excellence. 

In growing the business, we find investments that 

make sense to us, cover our cost of capital, work 

within our risk parameters, and create added value. 

It is fundamental that both our shareholders and 

stakeholders benefit from our value creation efforts. 

We continuously engage with all our stakeholders 

so they may also progress as our businesses grow. 

Attracting, optimizing, and retaining top-caliber 

professionals, who help us manage our business 

and upgrade the Group’s capabilities and skills, are 

crucial to our success. 

We execute our plans in a timely and effective 

manner, employing best-in-class systems and 

processes to sharpen our competitive edge.

forging cooperation, partnerships, and common 

aspirations of a better future.

Our stakeholder engagement process maximizes the 

many communication avenues currently available

Supply Chain Management

Our investments in power, banking and financial 

services, food, infrastructure, and real estate enable 

us to have indirect economic impacts through 

our supply chain. Our business units adapt best 

practices in supply chain management and provide 

opportunities to local suppliers whenever possible. 

Operational and management plans help us integrate 

resource efficiency in our supply chain to be more 

prudent in the volume of materials used in the 

operations.

Generally, our supply chain management processes 

look into product/ service innovation, delivering 

excellent quality, and fulfilling the demands of 

our customers. ESG risks that are critical in the 

supply chain are being reviewed based on supplier 

compliance requirements that may vary depending 

on the industry sector where our strategic business 

units belong to.

Significant improvements and innovations in our 

supply chain

There are ongoing initiatives that promote the local 

supply chain, such as Food Group PH’s partnership 

with DAR for the local corn sourcing. This would 

help local farmers for additional revenue and help 

the company have a more secure supply chain by 

purchasing locally. 

Several digital innovations are undertaken by our 

supply chain teams in terms of online accreditation 

and supply chain management process through 

the use of procurement and supplier accreditation 

software systems. These innovations help us adapt 

to the impacts of the pandemic in terms of delivery 

of supplies and reducing face-to-face meetings with 

suppliers.

Innovation Management

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a wake-up call for 

most businesses in terms of digital transformation. 

The concept of a ‘new normal’ was borne out of 

regulations for reduced close-contact interactions 

and strict travel and hygiene restrictions. This new 

normal has given rise to new individual behavior and 

habits, and has pushed businesses to adapt quickly by 

bringing many of their processes online. 

 

The Aboitiz Group’s early investments in digital 

transformation equipped us well in facing the 

COVID-19 pandemic. We started this in 2016, 

recognizing that digital disruption is happening at 

an accelerated pace globally. This prompted us to 

establish one of our first major projects, our internal 

engagement platform called AGORA, powered by 

Facebook’s Workplace platform. AGORA connects 

Aboitiz Group team members in one single platform 

for unified communication and collaboration. Apart 

from this, many other digital transformation initiatives

have been rolled out over the last four years under 

the following imperatives: improve our revenue 

streams; embed emerging and relevant technologies, 

data, and analytics to improve operational efficiencies 

and decision-making process; create an agile 

workplace to improve collaboration and productivity 

of our A-People; and, equip our team members with 

the right tools to continuously deliver value to our 

stakeholders.

2020 Innovation Programs

• AEV and AboitizPower successfully held their first 

ever Virtual Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, which 

included the capability of having shareholders vote 

online and participate in its live proceedings.

• Integrating a data-driven approach in its operation, 

Therma South, Inc. embedded IoT technology — 

Digital Twin — into its power plant assets. This 

allows engineers to predict and accurately diagnose 

issues, and respond before these negatively impact 

its assets. This improved balance between reliability, 

availability, performance, and cost against risks to 

maximize asset value.

• UnionBank continues to pioneer out-of-the-box 

solutions in the Group as digital banking became 

even more relevant as the ECQ was imposed. These 

solutions include its Bank on Wheels, fully digital 

bank account opening, and pioneering online check 

encashments — highlighting how bank branches are 

becoming less transactional and, instead, more as 

interactional spaces for today’s customers. 

• Pilmico launched The Good Meat Shop online, 

which brings its farm products within easy and 

convenient reach of its customers. The company 

also migrated stakeholder engagement discussions 

to online platforms, including workshops, interest 

groups, live demos, and consultation sessions. 

• Aboitiz InfraCapital launched its corporate 

website and social media accounts that gave way 

to enriching online interaction with its customers. 

The company is also instrumental to enabling 

innovation with its entry into telecommunications 

infrastructure. Taking advantage of data science and 

artificial intelligence, Republic Cement is able to 

optimize concentrations of raw materials resulting 

in better resource management and increased 

operational efficiency.

• AboitizLand introduced contactless homebuying 

using digital options to help promote staying safe at 

home. Potential homebuyers are offered a

view of numerous projects through 360-degree 

virtual tours.

• Contactless entry in offices was explored and 

implemented through the help of different 

identification technologies such as facial

recognition and QR codes.

Enterprise Architecture

 

In 2020, AEV and AboitizPower ventured into an 

Enterprise Architecture (EA) program, which aims 

to lay the foundations of people, processes, and 

technology needed to achieve business goals 

and aspirations. Through EA, we will effectively 

adopt emerging technologies in exploring business 

opportunities and leverage data and analytics to 

sharpen our competitive edge towards becoming a 

more dynamic and resilient organization. 

 

Once established, the EA program will serve as the 

master plan to accelerate our business capabilities 

and innovate our products and services as part of 

the Aboitiz Group’s continuing digital transformation 

journey. The program is expected to produce initial 

output this 2021.

 

Embracing a data-driven approach to a

sustainable future 

Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Aboitiz 

Group had already mapped out a strategy for 

harnessing the full potential of Data Science and 

Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) in advancing business 

and communities. As we embrace innovation 

further, DSAI will inform every decision, guide every 

interaction, and drive every process to deliver 

optimal business outcomes. DSAI will be at the center 

of every successful Aboitiz business, where our team 

members are equipped  to turn insight into action 

and deliver data science solutions that would create 

the best experience for all our stakeholders. 

Across the Group, we are seeing gains from our 

data-driven approach to our sustainability, efficiency, 

and business objectives. We will continue to build 

on these gains through demonstration, awareness, 

enablement, and ecosystem partnership in order 

to deliver data science solutions that empower our 

communities towards achieving optimal business 

outcomes that will drive change for a better world.

We remain committed to growing our business in

a manner that has the least adverse effect on the 

environment, people, and communities. Our subsidiaries 

and business units abide by extensive and increasingly 

stringent safety, health, and environmental laws and 

regulations. We have designated pollution control officers 

in our different business units to monitor compliance with 

these regulations. Upholding the well-being of our team 

members at all times, we adhere to strict standards and 

constantly improve the conduct of our operations to ensure 

a safe workplace. 

In the midst of a global pandemic, our strict implementation 

of COVID-19 safety protocols are aligned with government-

mandated minimum health standards. A Return-to-Work 

playbook has been put together by our COVID-19 Technical 

Working Group, which consolidates protocols and guidelines 

that need to be followed in order to protect all our team 

members across the Group. This playbook is consistently 

updated and communicated to all team members via 

existing digital communication platforms. 

The Aboitiz Integrated Management System (AIMS) 

represents our commitment to implement our Information 

Security Management System (ISMS) and our Quality 

Management System (QMS). The ISMS safeguards the 

confidentiality, integrity, and availability of company 

information, while the QMS makes certain that systems

are always updated and improved across our corporate 

service units.

We, likewise, subscribe to the Department of Energy’s 

Energy Regulation 1-94 that requires power generation 

companies to allocate funds for their host communities to 

protect both the natural environment and the people living 

in the area.

UnionBank is keeping its promise to integrate environmental 

sustainability into its operations with 21 of its branches 

now LEED-certified. LEED, or Leadership in Energy and 

Environmental Design, is an internationally recognized 

standard for green buildings that promote healthy,

durable, affordable, and environmental practices in building 

and construction. 

For the Food Group, the Pilmico Integrated Management 

System (IMS) ensures that all team members are guided 

in their decisions and activities pertaining to quality, 

information security, halal assurance, as well as HACCP 

(Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points) food safety and 

good manufacturing practices. 

Occupational Health and Safety (OSH)

As we have emphasized, the health and safety of the 

team members remains our top priority to ensure a 

sustainable work environment. The Group is guided by 

applicable Occupational Health and Safety Standards set 

by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). Part 

of our IMS is to recognize and identify health and safety 

risks, and to set out policies and processes to mitigate and 

address risks.

AEV and its subsidiaries’ occupational health and safety 

guidelines cover both organic and contracted employees 

working in our facilities. Contractors may have no 

employer-employee relationship but are, nonetheless, 

covered by the company’s “prevailing influence”. 

“Prevailing Influence” is when contracted employees are 

required to adhere to safety rules and regulations laid 

down by the company or to use methods, processes, or 

other techniques provided by the company.

Aboitiz employs a process of hazard aspect identification, 

risk assessment, and setting out of controls (HAIRADC 

process) through the different Safety and Health, 

Environment, and Security Teams in the Group. Results 

of these processes are evaluated and included in our 

Operational Risk Management Plans.

Health services are made available to our team members 

whether they are in a work-from-home set-up, reporting 

to the office, or staying at operations facilities. These 

are prepared with careful consideration of the impacts 

of the pandemic in the work conditions. Medical 

teleconsultations are made available for team members 

working from home while designated clinics are set-

up at our operations facilities. Services covered by the 

company’s external medical insurance providers are also 

being utilized and recommended.

The Group ensures continued OSH awareness for its team 

members by conducting trainings and drill exercises. 

The Mandatory Eight-hour Safety and Health webinar 

(MESH) is a DOLE requirement for employers to provide 

to all of its employees. Topics covered are introduction 

and understanding of OSH, administrative, statutory and 

legal requirements, basic safety rules and measures on 

workplace hazards, HAIRADC, and emergency response. 

This provides the needed training and increases the 

awareness of employees on safety, increasing employee 

engagement as well. Prior to the pandemic, this training 

was conducted face-to-face, typically at our corporate 

offices. Converting it to a webinar allowed the course to 

be taken by more team members across the Group and 

from all our locations. The training material continues to 

be available on-demand for future team members’

training and awareness.

Team member inclusion in OSH discussions is also an 

important practice. The Aboitiz Safety Committees 

organized in the corporate headquarters and strategic 

business units deliver the following:

• Ensure that the occupational safety and health program 

in the workplace is observed and enforced

• Create avenues to discuss OSH operational guidelines

• Promote and maintain an atmosphere of open and 

harmonious discussion of safety issues for the prevention 

of accidents and injuries and control of hazard

• Deliver the OSH trainings, drill exercises and OSH audits

• Conduct monthly office/facility safety inspections

• Develop and deliver training and awareness

eLearning modules for office safety as well as acts as 

Disaster Preparedness Committee during calamities 

such as typhoons and earthquakes.

In 2020, our strategic business units launched different 

OSH programs, including AboitizPower’s WATCHApp 

(Behavior Based Safety Mobile Application Program) used 

by team members, contractors, and visitors to report 

safety-related observations. This tool allows the company 

to monitor and quickly address safety concerns in the 

workplace. Pilmico, in encouraging and promoting safe 

workplace behavior, launched its Safety Reward System: 

Safety Ambassador of the Month program wherein good 

safety performance and behaviors of employees are 

recognized on a monthly basis.

Aboitiz Sustainability Programs

The Aboitiz Group believes in taking

serious action towards creating a sustainable 

future. By aligning with the UN Sustainable 

Development Goals, we implement and 

strengthen our sustainability programs that 

aim to minimize and address the impact of 

climate change on the environment

and society.

Resource Efficiency and Waste Management

Our Race to Reduce (R2R) programs at our 

strategic business units have paved the 

way for addressing concerns related to 

biodiversity, resource efficiency, and

waste management. 

In 2020, our team member engagement 

campaigns continued to promote lifestyle 

changes that reduce carbon emission 

and water consumption in daily routines. 

This includes the Global Goals awareness 

campaign of the United Nations on UN Day, 

cascaded through the Aboitiz Academy.

Our unified waste management framework called Wealth Out of Waste (WOW) is designed to increase 

efficiency, engagement, and even revenue. In support of RA 9003 (Solid Waste Management Act) and RA 

6969 (Toxic Substances and Hazardous and Nuclear Wastes Control Act of 1990), our strategic business 

units identify waste management plans, develop policies, and implement and audit processes for the 

management of hazardous solid waste and effluent. Through WOW, we are able to identify gaps and 

consolidate our existing waste management efforts into a single direction that maximizes positive impact 

both internally and externally.

Climate-related Action and Programs

A-PARK Program

The Department of Environment and Natural 

Resources (DENR) extended its National Greening 

Program to 2028 to revitalize what it cited as the 

remaining unproductive, denuded, and degraded 

forestlands in the country through reforestation 

initiatives. The Aboitiz Group participated in this 

program and has even transcended its target to plant 

9 million trees by 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the 

group has planted 11.73 million trees in partnership 

with the tree-growing project of Ramon Aboitiz 

Foundation, Inc., Philippine Business for

Social Progress, and the carbon sink program 

of Therma South, Inc. and Therma Visayas Inc. 

Collectively, this is the Group’s contribution to help 

mitigate climate change, making PHP474,494 million 

in total investments.

Local Climate Change Action Planning

(LCCAP) Program

We partnered with the Climate Change Commission 

in conducting training on Local Climate Change Action 

Planning to increase capacities of local municipalities. 

Communities learn to become climate-resilient by 

identifying risks and vulnerabilities and developing 

long-term strategies to reduce risk and future losses 

on livelihood, human settlements, and resources.

Coastal Ecosystems.

Ecosystem-based Biodiversity Management

Led by its different strategic business units, the Aboitiz 

Group initiated programs to manage our impact on 

Life on Water (SDG 14) and Life on Land (SDG 15). 

Initial environmental impact assessments for business 

projects have led to management of different flora 

and fauna species in different ecosystems adjacent to 

where our business units operate. 

Coastal Ecosystems

In 2020, the Aboitiz Cleanergy Park was cited by a local 

expert as a birdwatching haven, with its wide variety 

of animal habitat types combined with the area’s 

relative isolation and secure environment.

The eight-hectare park is home to a mangrove 

reforestation site, nursery, botanical garden for the 

propagation of 29 natives tree species, and 100 

species of birds. Since 2014, the park has nurtured 

and released more than 4,939 hawksbill turtle 

hatchlings, planted 13,992 mangroves, and rescued 

16 pawikans (sea turtles).

We also have the Calubcub 2: Pawikan Conservation 

at AboitizLand’s Seafront Residences residential 

development project in San Juan, Batangas. It was 

launched to protect local biodiversity, lessen the 

environmental impact, and create a sustainable

and eco-friendly seaside community. The partnership 

between AboitizLand and UP Diliman-Institute of 

Environmental Science and Meteorology paved 

the way towards achieving the company’s goals in 

conducting research, setting up standard facilities

for the pawikan, and monitoring &amp; evaluation

of environmental impact. It also espoused 

conservation operations, capacity building, and 

Information, Education and Communication (IEC) 

activities within the community of the vecinos, 

including the barangay. Now in its third year, the 

program has recorded a total of 1,181 pawikan 

hatchlings released.

Forest Ecosystems

The A-Park program is our nationwide reforestation initiative, 

under which planted trees play key roles in the Group’s overall 

carbon sequestration thrust and action on climate change, 

specifically SDG 13 (Take urgent action to combat climate 

change and its impacts) and SDG 17 (Institutional partnerships 

to revitalize the global partnership for sustainable 

development). The program also serves as our contribution

to the government’s greening efforts in partnership with

the DENR.

In 2010, AboitizPower adopted Pangarap, one of the country’s 

few remaining female Philippine eagles. The company 

allocates funding for food, veterinary care, and shelter 

maintenance for the 22-year-old eagle, which was captive-

bred and raised through a combination of hand- and puppet-

rearing. Pangarap remains in the care of the Philippine Eagle 

Foundation (PEF) in Davao City and continues to symbolize 

the Aboitiz Group’s hopes and dreams both in wildlife 

conservation and for the Philippines as a country to take 

flight. Since she was first adopted, Pangarap remains in good 

health and is one of the few eagles still eligible to reproduce 

and regrow her species’ population.

Wetlands and Rivers

Balabag Wetland Park (Wetland 4) 

The pandemic did not halt our continued efforts for the 

rehabilitation of Balabag Wetland Park in Boracay, Aklan. 

Set for turnover in 2021, the entire wetland area is being 

converted to an urban linear park with these enhancements:

 

Five aerators to improve the water quality

A 3D ‘Boracay’ letter signage as a design feature and 

point of interest

Community center in front of D’Mall; to also serve as an

activity area 

Perimeter landscaping and pavers covering its

entire surrounding

Parking area for proper loading and unloading of visitors

Among the key upcoming features are a plaza and a 

boardwalk lined with trees and plants endemic to Boracay to 

help rebuild the area’s biodiversity. These will be constructed 

by the partner government agency in 2021.

San Juan River Rehabilitation 

The partnership between Aboitiz and the DENR for 

#WOWSanJuanRiver or the San Juan River (Manila 

Bay) Rehabilitation Project is continuously being 

implemented through stakeholder engagements 

involving different government agencies. This 

involves the development of a working framework 

and creating a model for other Manila Bay 

tributaries. Included in the pipeline are ‘eco-hubs’, 

trash traps, and a small boat to clear areas and 

sections of the river.

Sustainability Education

Cleanergy Center, AboitizPower’s first energy 

educational facility, is located in the Admin 

Compound of MakBan Geothermal Power Plant in 

Brgy. Bitin, Bay, Laguna. It features basic tools used 

in power generation, educational videos about the 

different types of energy sources, a tour of a working 

geothermal power plant, and an interactive room 

where visitors can experience simulation activities 

like making their own wind turbine, charging phones 

by biking, among others. A total of 56,000 visitors 

have toured the Center to learn how AboitizPower 

produces renewable energy and provides energy 

solutions that leave a lighter impact on our 

environment and host communities.  

In Davao, AboitizPower’s Energy Education Center 

(EEC) was opened in 2016 and is located inside 

Therma South’s baseload power plant complex. 

It features interactive and informative displays on 

the Philippine energy sector and various power-

generating technologies. As of 2020, the center has 

welcomed about 3,500 visitors.

Other Projects

In partnership with the City Government of Davao, 

the Aboitiz Group through Davao Light &amp; Power 

Company (Davao Light) and Aboitiz Foundation,

GET Philippines, and QEV Technologies launched

the BEST Bus project – the first fully electric, free 

shuttle service in Mindanao. Likewise, Davao City 

holds the distinction of being among the project’s 

first pilot locations. 

BEST stands for Business for Environmentally 

Sustainable Transformation and is an initiative 

advocating to “be green, be digital, and be kind” for 

the betterment of the community. In significantly 

reducing harmful emissions, maximizing available 

new technologies, and encouraging inclusive 

benefits for all, the BEST Bus project aims to leave 

a lasting impact on environmental sustainability. 

A total of seven new fully air-conditioned electric 

buses that feature an electric ramp and reserved 

space for PWDs have been made available to 

the public. The BEST Bus operates daily on two 

downtown routes that pass through Davao City’s 

major activity centers and with bus stops every 400 

meters along the way. 

The Community-Based Disaster Risk Reduction 

and Management program is a customized 

approach that promotes localized decision-making 

and implementation to reduce vulnerabilities and 

promote zero casualties in disaster situations.

Through the Cooperative Business Continuity 

Plan, micro, small and medium enterprises 

conducted business continuity planning to 

strengthen community enterprise and to reduce 

their vulnerability to the impacts of unforeseen 

events, including major emergencies and disasters. 

In 2020, in lieu of in-person trainings discontinued 

in the pandemic, e-learning seminars were 

conducted by Aboitiz Foundation in partnership 

with the Department of Agriculture, Cooperative 

Development Authority, and Go Negosyo.

The Aboitiz Group believes that a balance between 

business priorities and societal needs is needed for 

a sustainable future. The AEV Risk Management 

Team supports the Group’s sustainability efforts 

by ensuring that we have an Enterprise Risk 

Management program that helps manage 

sustainability issues and create shared value for our 

communities. We are able to accomplish this by 

utilizing a robust risk management process, creating 

awareness, and building team member capabilities 

while maximizing available resources

and technologies.

 

The year 2020 underscored the importance of Risk 

Management in organizations. Our well-established 

Enterprise Risk Management program, with its 

Level 4 Risk Maturity rating, backed the Group’s 

resilience during the unprecedented pandemic. 

Risk Management will continue to take a full 

organizational approach, integrating with other 

business functions to drive a clearer understanding

of our risks.

Managing Top Risks

 

To ensure that we are managing risks that are 

relevant to our business goals, we regularly review 

the Risk Management Plans of all Aboitiz Group 

business units and discuss these with senior 

management and the Board.

 

Pandemic Risk 

 

In 2020, one of the major risks that we closely 

monitored was the Pandemic Risk, which covers 

communicable diseases such as COVID-19. The virus 

outbreak triggered a shift in our organization’s risk 

profile. The imposition of the Enhanced Community 

Quarantine (ECQ) in the Philippines caused 

limitations in the people’s movements, disruptions 

in project operations, and customers’ changing 

priorities. All these resulted in:

• A decline in the demand and consumption of 

goods and services. 

• Some customers were unable to meet their 

financial obligations because of the closure of 

many businesses and increased unemployment.

• Getting project funding was also affected 

since the decreased economic activity and 

the anticipated downgrade in credit ratings of 

companies caused tight market conditions that 

resulted in lower credit appetite of lenders. 

Risk Management:

Supporting Business Growth and Sustainability





• The shift to a work-from-home setup 

increased the risk of information security and 

may have had possible negative effects on the 

well-being of some team members. 

• New regulations and legislations were issued 

by the government that we had to constantly 

align to and comply with. 

 

To manage these risks, we put in place different 

treatment plans and controls such as, but not

limited to the: 

• Continuous review and update of plans 

and processes to align with the changing 

environment and requirements 

• Launch of awareness campaigns 

• Maximization of digital platforms

• Strict enforcement of health and safety 

protocols in sites and facilities 

• Health and wellness initiatives to protect the 

psychological and mental health of employees 

 

Apart from the risks enumerated above, we 

recognized the opportunities that emerged from 

this pandemic. The disruption in the supply chain 

accelerated the shift to a hybrid workplace that 

was already being implemented in some business 

units. While it has some challenges, this current 

set-up enabled us to test the effectiveness of our 

IT capabilities that we had started to develop 

and roll out pre-pandemic. The delays in project 

execution and the decline in market demand drove 

the accelerated planning and implementation of 

initiatives with minimal or no investment required. 

We continued nonstop in extending help to 

communities, re-channeling our resources to align 

with helping the medical communities and local 

governments in their COVID-19 response efforts.   

 

Project Risk

 

Project Risk remains to be one of the Group’s top 

risks. COVID-19 travel restrictions and mandated 

community quarantines caused delays in the 

completion of existing projects. While the pandemic 

affected the operations timeline of some of the 

Group’s projects, it also opened an opportunity for 

us to explore other initiatives that could be more 

effective and efficient. 

 

Risk management is the practice of ensuring the 

stability and success of a project. We carefully 

evaluate each significant and potential project to 

gain a more rigorous understanding of the risks 

involved. Lessons-learned sessions are part of 

our process for each major milestone, enabling 

the team to celebrate quick wins, learn from 

past or current challenges, and seize emerging 

opportunities from the project. This practice 

enhances the company’s ability to capture 

opportunities that help define the organization’s 

future. 

 

Regulatory Risk 

 

We give a significant amount of attention to 

regulatory risks, as the Group is engaged in

highly-regulated industries such as power,

banking, food, infrastructure, and construction.

Each industry has specific regulatory risks, but 

what is common among them is that regulations 

are usually challenging and constantly changing. It 

is therefore imperative for us to keep up with the 

demands of regulatory compliance, as failure to

do so will have negative consequences on both the 

Group’s net income and reputation.

 

To mitigate regulatory risk, we forecast how 

regulations and legislation will affect our various

businesses, and we prepare plans for expected 

changes, rather than just waiting for new 

regulations to be imposed. We work closely with 

the Corporate External Relations and Legal teams in 

monitoring any changes in laws and regulations. We 

also participate in consultative processes for more 

public discussions on the necessity or propriety 

of specific regulations; their relevance to current 

business practices; and technology changes that 

could lead to the development of new regulations 

and policies that will be beneficial to the Group.

 

In our efforts to innovate regulatory risk 

management, we are rolling out the Aboitiz Unified 

Compliance Management System, based on the 

Governance, Risk, and Compliance methodology. 

This system enables us to have better compliance 

management and oversight because of the 

availability of more data and information. 

Information Security Risk

 

Information security risk remains as one of the top 

risks managed by the Group, due to the increasing 

number of information security breach events 

happening globally, both for Information Technology 

(IT) and Operations Technology (OT). The COVID-19 

pandemic increased this risk as people work from 

home and conduct various transactions online.

The Group was able to avoid breaches in 2020, as 

a result of our efforts in building an information 

security risk-aware culture that strengthens 

the prevention, detection, and comprehensive 

response process of team members. We also 

continue to strengthen our security and resilience 

through our Information Security Management 

System (ISMS) and Operational Technology (OT) 

Security Governance. It is imperative to enforce 

these security measures as breaches can have 

catastrophic implications on the organization’s 

bottom line and reputation.

 The Group continues its journey to achieve Level 

4 in Cyber Security Maturity, which means having 

a formal cybersecurity policy that covers all critical 

systems as well as the means to measure and 

monitor cybersecurity activities and behavior. 

Different IT and OT Teams across the Group together 

built a roadmap geared towards strengthening our 

technology, people, and processes.

 

Talent Risk

 

Talent risk encompasses the acquisition, retention, 

and optimization of team members across the 

Group. In 2020, we revisited the context of this 

risk as well as the identified treatments to ensure 

their alignment with the Group’s response to the 

COVID-19 pandemic. We acknowledge that the 

pandemic has strongly affected the day-to-day life of 

our team members and will require their adapting 

to new competencies to support the agility, 

resilience, and psychological engagement they need 

to thrive. 

The inability to prepare and manage the impact of 

this risk may cause potential delays in executing 

various deliverables, which could eventually lead to 

missed business opportunities. The current situation 

may also negatively affect the team members’ 

mental, physical, and psychological well-being. 

As a response, engagement programs across 

the different business units were enhanced, and 

plans for digital learning and development were 

accelerated to ensure that the ongoing work-from-

home set-up will not halt the development of all our 

team members and leaders.

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)

 

To adapt to the changing environment, we 

revisited the Financial and Supply Chain Risk 

Management Frameworks and the Group Risk 

Management Competencies in 2020. In light of 

the pandemic, we incorporated many revisions 

and the enhancements in our risk treatment plans.  

We also started to formalize the Pandemic Risk 

Management Framework as a guide for current 

and future occurrences. In collaboration with our 

external partners, we continued to build the risk 

management capability of the organization through 

e-learnings and other knowledge-sharing sessions 

on risk topics. 





We will continue to collaborate with the Strategy 

and Reputation Teams for the sustainability and 

climate risk-related initiatives of the Group; the 

output will eventually be integrated into the Risk 

Management Framework. In 2021, apart from our 

ERM operational activities, we will start setting up 

our Risk Management and Risk Finance systems. 

We will also enhance our existing Risk Framework 

to better support the management of the Group’s 

top risks and material sustainability issues, 

including climate-related risks. 

 

Risk Finance in a Hardening Insurance Market

 

In 2020, the insurance market continued

to harden, resulting in a steady increase in 

premium rates, difficulty to place 100% of risks, 

and reductions in policy covers or terms. We 

expect this situation to be aggravated by the 

impact of the pandemic and will carry on for 

the next couple of years. Thus, we focused on 

continuously improving the Group’s risk profile 

through a regular review of risk treatment and 

business continuity plans, the implementation of 

asset management (ISO 55001), and addressing 

areas for improvement identified in our risk 

engineering surveys.

 

In 2021, in aiming to minimize the impact of

the hardened insurance market, we will continue 

to explore new insurance markets to lessen 

placement difficulty, study the viability of

non-traditional risk transfer programs to mitigate 

identified risks, and optimize our captive 

participation to manage the increase in risk 

transfer costs.

 

Business Continuity Management (BCM) 

 

The successive disruptive events in 2020 – the 

COVID-19 outbreak, the Taal eruption, and other 

natural disasters – put to the test not only our 

existing business continuity plans but also the 

responsiveness of our organization. We formed 

Technical Working Groups (TWGs) to actively 

monitor situations and we activated applicable 

Business Continuity Plans. Various guidelines, 

protocols, and initiatives were developed and 

102-15, 103-1, 103-2

102-15, 103-1, 103-2

Different plans and controls were put in place to manage 

risks, ensure business continuity, and provide a swift 

response to the communities we serve.

maintained in our business units Group-wide, to 

protect not only the Group’s interests but also 

our people. Despite the ongoing disruptions, we 

were able to carry on with our BCM maintenance 

activities. These included completing the Group-

wide Incident Management Guidelines, updating 

our Business Impact Analysis (which aims to allocate 

and use recovery resources more efficiently), and 

improving our capability building activities by 

developing new tools and instructional guides.

 

In 2021, we will pursue our COVID-19 response 

initiatives and strengthen our operational resilience 

through the continuous enhancement of our BCM 

capabilities. Our frameworks and guidelines will 

help in the Group’s integrated efforts in prevention, 

preparedness, response, and recovery. We will also 

look into new scenarios that may develop as a result 

of climate change. 

 

Part of our business continuity plan review will 

include a reassessment of the natural catastrophe 

scenarios that each site is exposed to, their 

potential increase in frequency and magnitude

 and the sufficiency of the current plans in 

addressing the scenarios. We will continue to 

educate our people and generate awareness 

through training, industry benchmarking, and 

leveraging best practices.

Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) 

Awareness and Capability Building

 

In 2020, we strengthened the Group’s ISMS Program 

by improving processes, technology, and most 

importantly, our people.

People – We rolled out four eLearning modules, 

including topics such as making our suppliers our 

partners in securing our information assets, and 

managing information security incidents. These 

completed our 24-month roll-out of our ISMS 

eLearning for the Group.  Despite the work-from-

home set-up, we were able to push through with 

activities for the Information and CyberSecurity 

Awareness Month in November. In partnership 

with the IT Security Team, we held a series of 

learning sessions for the whole month. In 2021, we 

will continue working closely with our partners to 

ensure a holistic approach to managing information 

security risks. We will also pursue capability-building 

activities focusing on information security where 

there are recorded non-compliances and incidents.

Process – We were able to complete the gap 

assessment on cybersecurity across the Group in 

collaboration with AEV IT Security. We enhanced 

our cyber risk incident management processes by 

conducting various simulation exercises and we will 

continue these activities in 2021. We also intensified 

our compliance efforts for the Data Privacy Act 

by integrating the monitoring of our Information 

Security controls with Pillar 4 of Data Privacy. 

Technology - Together with the IT Security team, 

we improved the Group’s detection and monitoring 

systems by using more fit-for-purpose technologies. 

We also partnered with key vendors who will

assist us in global threat intelligence and digital 

forensics investigation.



On February 4, 1920, the Bureau of Commerce 

and Industry approved the corporation papers 

of Aboitiz y Compania Incorporada, capitalized 

at PHP1.25 million and PHP500,000 in paid-up 

capital. A hundred years later, in 2020, Aboitiz had 

a capitalization of Php10 billion with PHP5.7 billion 

paid-up. This is a growth of 8,000%  for a company 

that started over a century ago as a trading business 

partnership between Paulino Aboitiz and Jose 

Muertegui. 

Aboitiz and Company (ACO) survived many

difficult situations, including near bankruptcy and 

war devastation. Resilience, business acumen, a 

sense of timing, and the “palabra de honor” of 

Aboitiz patriarch Don Ramon, steered the business 

to a path of continued growth and success.

This is the Aboitiz Way.

Around thirty years before ACO took Aboitiz Equity 

Ventures Inc. (AEV) public in 1994, the internal audit 

function was already recognized as an integral part 

of the company’s operations. Team leaders were

committed to implementing effective internal

controls, and had placed great importance on 

the internal audit function. They did these not 

only because a governing body like the Securities 

and Exchange Commission required it, but they 

also recognized the immense value of having an 

independent assurance to ensure that the company’s 

risk management, governance, and internal controls 

are operating effectively.  

A quick lookback 

• 1960s: The Internal Audit Team was established 

as a line function of ACO’s Accounting 

Department.

• 1970s: The Internal Audit Team became a 

separate, independent unit.

• 1980s: Erramon Aboitiz took over the reins of

the department.

• 1990s: The Corporate Audit Team (CAT) 

implemented many process changes and 

improvements such as adoption of the Peter’s 

matrix format in audit reporting, acquisition of 

the first version of the Audit Command Language 

data analytics tool, and introduction of the audit 

Customer Satisfaction Survey.

• Early 2000s: Process enhancements continued 

in the next few years with the formalization of 

the Internal Audit charters, implementation of 

the Issues Monitoring matrix, introduction of the 

COSO-based audit rating, and intensified trainings 

for new auditors;

• 2012: The CAT was rebranded as the Group 

Internal Audit (GIA). Resident internal audit teams 

were formed in key business units to expand

Our internal audit team acts as an independent unit that ensures the company's functions and controls in management 

and governance are operating effectively.

the coverage scope of audit, increase vigilance,

and establish expertise in the area of

operational controls.

• Present: The GIA remains as the core internal 

audit team for AEV and for subsidiaries that do 

not have their own resident internal auditors. 

The team provides general oversight to the 

internal audit function across the Aboitiz Group. 

As the Aboitiz Group continues to grow as one

of the largest and most respected conglomerates

in the country, our challenge is to ensure that

the audit team is in step with this increasing level 

of excellence.

It is important to look at audit from the perspective 

that it is a long-term investment for a good night’s 

rest and peace of mind. Internal audit works for 

the good of the organization — its people, its 

processes, and all its stakeholders. Each of them 

relies on auditors and compliance professionals to 

ensure that the company will maximize the utility 

expected of them without waste, inefficiency, or 

fraud. Internal audit’s primary roles are:

• To provide assurance to management and

the  Board about the efficiency and 

effectiveness of company  policies and 

operations, and the status of compliance with 

legal and statutory obligations; 

• To  provide oversight, assess existing controls, 

and recommend actions on identified  gaps 

and weaknesses;  and ultimately,

• To be a business partner and advisor

to stakeholders. 

The Role of Auditors

As auditors, we do not claim to be experts in 

everything but our aim is to always add value 

and venture outside what is comfortable by 

continuously learning about the different 

businesses and the external factors that affect 

them. We fully support the achievement of our 

organization’s business objectives, goals, and 

mission whether for-profit or non-profit. We do our 

checks and balances. We ensure that a fair process 

is followed. We work towards being auditors that 

are risk-focused, skilled, and business-savvy. In 

this ever-changing business landscape, we need 

to be able to constantly adapt and work towards 

accelerated competence building.  Only then can we 

be able to truly add and contribute significantly to 

achieving sustainable shareholder value.   Our vision 

is to be the most trusted partner in value creation in 

the management of governance, risk, and controls 

while living our corporate values of integrity, 

teamwork, innovation, and responsibility.

 

• Courageous authenticity.  Our core value of 

integrity allows us to do what we do best—take 

tough stands, discuss the “undiscussables”, 

and openly deal with problems. Practicing 

courageous authenticity is instrumental for 

our stakeholders to see how well audit can be 

trusted to walk the talk. 

• Combined assurance. Our core value of 

teamwork allows us to rely on the work of 

non-auditors. As internal auditors, we cannot 

claim to be the sole assurance providers in 

the organization because we have the  ISO 

team, the quality auditors, the ISMS team, 

our security personnel, and subject-matter 

experts. They are the first and second line of 

defense. All contribute to providing assurance 

to management. Yet, we always fall into the 

trap of working in silos — to each his own. We 

need to combine and coordinate in reporting 

the output of these various assurance providers 

to create greater efficiencies and enhance 

transparency in the organization. Combined 

assurance, or drawing from the expertise of 

other assurance providers in the organization, 

will bring us to a higher level of maturity in risk 

management and assurance.

• Continuous auditing. The seeds have long 

been planted for us auditors to live our 

corporate value of innovation. We have the 

tools that allow auditors to leverage technology 

and perform real-time, continuous monitoring 

rather than just perform periodic reviews.  

• Source of talent. Living the value of 

responsibility is to adhere to good corporate 

governance, advocate sustainability, and care 

for all our stakeholders. We ensure that they 

take a fair share of the value creation that we 

auditors seek to provide as a trusted partner. 

A measure of success of a responsible auditor 

is when one becomes a first-pick, top-of-mind 

for frontline functions in the business units and 

departments that have been audited. When the 

internal audit department becomes a key source 

of talent, it is a testament to how well we lived 

the value of responsibility.  It is worth noting that 

many key executives in the Aboitiz Group were 

once upon a time,  auditors.

Our audit road map has been set but it is also fluid.  

Designed to thrive on change,  it allows learning as we 

go along.  We try to bring out the best in the team and 

to push for changing the organizational mindset to look 

at and accept audit as a trusted partner. We are not an 

opponent to be feared or a policeman who will accost 

and punish you for wrongdoings. We are a partner who 

supports and works towards improving the design, 

implementation, and effectiveness of the organization’s 

objectives, programs, and activities. All these we do 

to help reduce the incidence of institutional fraud and 

overall operational gaps and weaknesses. 

The events that are shaping our world, our 

personal lives and the way we do business today 

are unprecedented. Today, it is not about auditors 

being just objective but being objective with a 

sense of purpose. It is not about auditors being just 

independent but being interdependent and finding 

the best synergies in working with stakeholders. It 

is living the depth of this role that we play in Aboitiz 

that translates to helping society. After all, we have to 

model and live our sustainability mindset of doing well 

by doing good.  

Why do we audit?  Why are we in audit? One answer: 

auditors want to make a positive contribution to 

the organization—to have a sense of mission about 

the work we do. As the Aboitiz Group Internal Audit 

Team, we are poised to do our part in creating a  new 

and future organization by developing a team that 

is highly visible, proactive, agile, driven, passionate, 

and ultimately, world-class. Audit has been that way 

for decades.  Aboitiz has been that way for a hundred 

years.  It will be like that for the next hundred.  It is 

simply the Aboitiz way.

Aboitiz considers Building Human Capital as one 

of our four strategic pillars. This means being able 

to support the execution of the Group’s strategies 

through people. We invest in resources and 

implement relevant programs that are focused on 

attracting, optimizing, and retaining the right talent. 

We also deliver an engaging talent experience 

through a seamless end-to-end HR service 

delivery. At the foundation of everything that we 

do, we create an environment and build a culture 

centered on our core values of integrity, teamwork, 

innovation, and responsibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has largely affected how we 

do things, including the work landscape. For us in 

the Aboitiz Group, the pandemic emphasized what 

should always be our top priority: our people. 

COVID-19 also made us re-look at our talent 

management framework and strategy.  Our strategic 

goal to attract, retain, optimize, and deliver a 

seamless talent experience through technology 

remains relevant. However, we refocused talent 

strategy to building organizational resiliency and 

capability to support the Group’s long term strategy 

through resilient people and agile systems. We 

define resiliency as the demonstration of agility 

and flexibility to adapt quickly to the changing 

requirements of the job. It also entails effective 

execution at an accelerated speed, where needed.

Talent Attraction

 

Employer Brand

We continue to live our Employer Value Proposition 

(EVP) which are the key attributes that differentiate 

the Aboitiz Group as an employer. Despite the 

physical limitations imposed by the COVID-19 

pandemic, we worked on increasing awareness of 

our EVP by communicating EVP stories on various 

social media platforms. Stories about how we are 

supporting team members’ health and safety and 

how we are helping the community during the 

pandemic have gained much attention from our 

target audience on different platforms.

Our engagement activities with academic 

institutions such as AIM and universities also 

continued albeit virtually.

 

Talent Management in the Aboitiz Group



The Aboitiz Group continues to put people first 

during this difficult time through our support for the 

government and our brave medical and security 

frontliners.  We remain committed to supporting our 

COVID-19 frontliners for the long term, and we

hope our assistance makes a difference in this 

ongoing battle.

Through MyTX, AEV HR’s information system 

launched in 2019, we were able to mine talent 

information and segment the members of the 

talent community so we can provide personalized 

career data, job opportunities, and company 

information. Access to the talent database is given 

to Aboitiz Group Talent Attraction teams so they 

may match open positions with team members —

providing opportunities for “bugsay” or self-driven 

development within the Group.

 

Talent Optimization

 

Digital Learning &amp; Development

Despite the challenges we faced in 2020, we were 

steadfast in ensuring that learning and development 

continue to thrive across the Group.

In March 2020, when most team members were 

deployed to work from home, the Aboitiz Academy 

quickly pivoted to digital learning to make sure 

that there is no disruption in the learning and 

development of team members.

 

The Aboitiz Group subscription to LinkedIn 

Learning, an online educational platform that 

provides a wide variety of courses from different 

experts on topics such as leadership, creativity, 

and technology, started with 100 pilot users at 

the beginning of 2020. In June 2020, subscribers 

increased to 305 as business units and more team 

members started to adapt to online, on-demand 

learning. LinkedIn Learning users in the Group 

recorded a total of 3,780 learning hours, which 

is beyond the 75th percentile benchmark among 

the companies using the same platform in the 

Philippines. At the end of 2020, 1,700+ licenses are 

ready to be activated, signifying that more team 

members are embracing digital learning.

Aside from LinkedIn Learning, we also developed 

our own e-learning content. E-learning versions of 

core and compliance courses were developed by 

internal experts. All other instructor-led training 

sessions were done virtually using Zoom or Google 

Meet as platforms. Our learning and development 

initiatives such as Learning Lunes, Lunch and 

Learn, Community Learning Sessions, and 

Leaders Connect continued and even gained 

more participation across the Group. The digital 

execution of these initiatives allowed us to scale 

up our offerings and invite team members and 

leaders outside Metro Manila and even in

other countries.

The Aboitiz Mentoring Partnership Program, which 

was usually done through face-to-face meetings 

in the previous years, also shifted to online/virtual 

meetings. Despite the distance, Mentor-Mentee 

partnership increased by 19%.

Competency Development

 To ensure relevance in the changing and increasing 

complexity of work, the Aboitiz Group team leaders 

consistently review and update our competency 

framework. Team Leaders must remain culturally 

and emotionally connected with the “new normal” 

of engaging a hybrid workforce. The following were 

identified as necessary to prepare the organization 

for the future:

 

• The right attitude and defined core values

• Strong work ethic

• Strength of character to rise above

difficult situations

• Resiliency – agility, flexibility, adaptability

• Technology/digital skills, creativity,

innovative mindset

• Interpersonal skills – effective 

communication, emotional intelligence, 

empathy

 

We align our core and elective course offerings 

to these competencies and ascertain that we 

support reskilling &amp; upskilling of our workforce. 

A leadership development program focused on 

Strategic Thinking and Innovation, Resilience and 

Leading Change is being developed to accelerate 

the development of future leaders in the 

organization. 

Succession Management

 Through the years, we have continuously 

improved our succession management processes, 

focusing on our critical talents across the Group.

 

The rigorous strategic workforce planning led 

to a more robust succession plan that helps 

us identify the leaders and successors that we 

need to develop and prepare for future roles 

in the organization. We have set the criteria to 

map talents and identify the high potentials and 

high performers across the Group. We have also 

established metrics to measure if we have a 

healthy succession plan and leadership pipeline. 

The two important metrics in succession are (1) 

Overall Sourcing Ratio, which means counting the 

number of positions that we fill internally versus 

positions that are filled by external sources; and 

(2) Succession Readiness, which is the number 

of “Ready Now” successors versus the number 

of positions with identified successors. Using 

a benchmark of 75% internal vs. 25% external 

sourcing ratio, we are currently at 76% internal 

vs. 24% external which is slightly above the 

benchmark. On succession readiness, the Aboitiz 

Group is at a satisfactory level based on external 

standards. By continuously identifying high-

potential and high-performing talents, we are able 

to prepare them for future roles.

We want to cultivate a culture of values and

Aboitiz Group President and CEO Sabin Aboitiz is 

at the forefront of building a culture of values and 

engaging people at all levels. Since the start of his 

leadership in January 2020, he has communicated 

to all team members of the Group through a 

town hall meeting entitled SuperDuperCon (a 

revamped, group-wide version of SuperCon, which 

was conducted when he was CEO of Pilmico). 

SuperDuperCon serves as an opportunity for team 

leaders to listen to the questions of our team 

members, give answers, and provide clarity on 

matters that are unclear yet important to them. 

During the pandemic, this event was scaled up 

and live-streamed to different locations in the 

Philippines and Asia, allowing more team members 

to participate. We were able to complete a total 

of 17 episodes with a total of more than 47,000 

views.

 

Aside from SuperDuperCon, our CEO also 

welcomes new team members through an 

onboarding activity called Welcome A-Board. 

This engagement activity is highly appreciated 

by new team members and helps elevate their 

overall employee experience. In addition, 

small group discussions called UpClose 

with the CEO were organized to give team 

members and leaders a venue to get to know 

the Aboitiz Group CEO, ask him questions, 

learn more about values and culture, and 

also ask about company performance and 

direction. In 2020, there were a total of 14 

sessions, participated by 145 team leaders 

and members across the Group.

Group Team Awards

The Aboitiz Way Group Team Awards was 

extra meaningful and valuable to team 

members as it allowed us to celebrate 

successes despite the challenges of 2020. 

A total of 43 nominations were received 

from across all the units in the group, all 

exemplifying the time-tested Aboitiz values. 

More than the award and recognition given to 

the chosen winners, it is the impact that they 

create that matters – not only to the team 

members and the organization but also to the 

communities that we serve.

The winners for the 2020 Aboitiz Group Team Awards came from different business units across the Group:

Health and Wellness

Health and wellness have become the top concern 

of team members due to the ongoing COVID-19 

pandemic.  Some team members experienced 

anxiety because of the virus, some are adjusting 

to their work arrangements which are sometimes 

not ideal – with limited or intermittent connection, 

distractions, inadequate workspace, etc.  There is 

also a perceived increase in workload, increasing 

time pressure, and more need for leadership 

support.

 

To address these issues, all business units 

implemented mental health and wellness 

programs, designed based on the needs of their 

respective team members:

Regularly conducted pulse surveys and 

check-ins with team members

Communications at different levels and 

venues (i.e. Teleconsultations, counseling 

sessions, 24/7 chat lines) were made 

available so that team member concerns are 

heard and addressed

wellness

HR Service Delivery

 

HR service delivery is about ensuring that we 

provide an engaging talent experience. In 2020,

we were able to fully implement the HR 

information system and  MyTX Phase 1 in AEV. 

It covered the automation of core HR, benefits 

administration, recruitment, onboarding, and 

talent relations management.

 

MyTX Phase 2, which includes strategic HR 

processes such as performance management, 

succession management, learning and 

development, workforce compensation, and 

people analytics, will be implemented in AEV in 

2021.

 

Apart from MyTX, in 2020, AEV and Aboitiz 

Infracap also planned and developed the 

Flexible Benefits (Flexben) program, following 

the design and system implemented in Pilmico. 

Flexben allows team members to choose benefits 

according to their specific needs. This program 

shall be fully implemented in 2021.

 

All SBUs will plan the digitization of HR end-to-end 

processes to ensure continuous improvement of 

talent experience. A data lake of all people records 

will enable us to use data analytics to provide us 

future insights that will be helpful in designing 

more effective talent management programs.

Corporate Governance Report

In 2020, the Aboitiz Group celebrated  the 100th 

anniversary of the incorporation of its parent 

company, Aboitiz &amp; Company, Inc. (ACO). This historic

Beginning from the time-honored philosophy of 

Don Ramon Aboitiz of Palabra de Honor, the Group

and corporate citizenship. Committed  to live by 

the Aboitiz core values of Integrity, Teamwork, 

Innovation, and Responsibility, the Group looks 

toward new horizons to expand in the next  100 

years, and to continue to drive change for a better 

world by advancing businesses and communities.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The AEV and AboitizPower Boards of Directors are 

at the helm of our Group’s corporate governance 

journey. Independent from management, they 

are committed to provide each company a 

strategic roadmap towards long-term growth, 

competitiveness, and building a sustainable business 

that, it is hoped, will thrive  for another 100 years. 

Each Board performs the crucial role of articulating 

and reviewing each company’s purpose, vision and 

mission, and strategies to carry out its goals. They 

ensure that the strategic direction of each company’s 

businesses are well defined, properly managed, and 

are aligned with the overall strategic goals of the 

Aboitiz Group. 

The Boards of AEV and AboitizPower each have 

nine members, all of whom come from diverse 

professional backgrounds. They are composed of

legal and finance professionals, engineers, former or 

current CEO/COOs, auditors, and accountants. Many 

of them have management experience in the private 

and government sectors, as well as in multilateral 

agencies. AboitizPower has three Independent 

Directors, three Non-Executive Directors, and three 

Executive Directors.  AEV has three Independent 

Directors, five Non-Executive Directors, and one 

Executive Director. The Chairmen of the AEV and 

AboitizPower Boards are highly experienced, Non-

Executive Directors who are not involved in the 

Group’s day-to-day operations. They therefore 

remain focused on refining each company’s long-

term strategy. The Lead Independent Directors are 

highly qualified professionals who are familiar with 

the operations of each company, and the industries it 

does business in.

In 2020, the members of the AEV and AboitizPower 

Boards of Directors were the following:

Commitment to the Corporate Mission, Vision, and 

Strategy 

The directors of AEV and AboitizPower acknowledge 

the importance of their role to lead and steer their 

respective companies as profitable and sustainable 

enterprises. The Board’s role for each company 

is to represent and protect the interests of its 

shareholders - the owners of the business - and 

other key external stakeholders. Guided by the 

Aboitiz Group’s purpose, brand promise, mission, 

and vision, the members of each Board, together 

with key officers and heads of the Strategic Business 

Units, participate in an Annual Board Retreat 

and Strategy Refresh. They review and align the 

corporate initiatives and strategic roadmaps of the 

Group’s core businesses with contemporary market 

and economic trends, both locally and worldwide. In 

2020, this annual engagement was held in a series of 

online sessions that began on October 29, 2020. 

Board Independence

By virtue of the Manuals and their respective 

Committee charters, the AEV and AboitizPower ESCG 

(Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance) 

Committees were tasked to develop and recommend 

a set of corporate governance principles, aimed 

to promote the independence of their respective 

Boards, including standards and guidelines applicable 

to the selection, contribution, and conduct of Board 

members. 

In 2020, the AEV and AboitizPower Boards were 

102-18, 102-19, 102-22, 102-23, 102-26, 102-27

102-18, 102-19, 102-22, 102-23, 102-26, 102-27


Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc.

composed of a majority of Non-Executive  Directors.  

AEV has three qualified Independent Directors and 

five Non-Executive Directors out of its nine Board 

members. Meanwhile, AboitizPower has three 

qualified Independent Directors and three Non-

Executive Directors out of its nine Board members. 

In addition, both Boards have each appointed a Lead 

Independent Director who serves as an intermediary 

between the Chairman and the other directors 

whenever necessary. 

Diversity

The diversity  in professional and personal 

backgrounds (age, ethnicity, culture, skills, 

competence, gender, knowledge, and expertise) of 

Board members ensures that no director or group 

of directors can dominate the deliberation and 

decision-making process.  AEV and AboitizPower 

can also benefit from the diverse perspectives 

in  formulating sound corporate strategies and  

advancing towards long-term success. The annual 

selection process of directors is intended to appoint 

a diverse mix of highly-competent directors and 

officers with in-depth knowledge and experience 

in the core industries where AEV and AboitizPower 

are involved. Other factors considered are 

independent-mindedness, ethical behavior, and 

value contribution.

Recognizing that a sustainable enterprise goes 

beyond the current generations of leaders, the AEV 

and AboitizPower Boards appointed Ms. Ana Maria 

A. Delgado and Mr. Danel C. Aboitiz, respectively, as 

Directors in 2018. Ana and Danel are part of a new 

generation of homegrown leaders who add fresh 

perspectives to each Board’s deliberation. Ana is also 

the first female member of AEV’s Board of Directors.

In 2020, the AEV and AboitizPower Boards initiated 

a process to review the profiles of the current 

Board members, in relation to an ideal profile,  

to determine their  subjective and objective 

qualifications that are aligned with the long-term 

strategic direction of the Group. This initiative is 

meant to identify areas in which each Board can 

improve in terms of ensuring its members have 

complementary competencies and skill sets, and 

to assess the qualifications of potential future 

candidates to each Board. 

Term Limits of Independent Directors

AEV and AboitizPower both comply with the 

requirements of SEC Memorandum Circular No. 

19, Series of 2016, prescribing a maximum term 

of nine years for independent directors, starting 

from 2012. In the nomination, selection, and 

election of the members of its Boards, AEV and 

AboitizPower recognize  and respect  the inviolable 

statutory right of each shareholder to vote and be 

voted as a director. If either AEV or  AboitizPower 

intends to retain an independent director who has 

served  the maximum of nine consecutive years, 

the shareholders of the relevant company shall be 

advised and provided with meritorious justifications 

during the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting (ASM) for 

which the election will take place. 

Directorships in Other Listed Companies

The ESCG Committee of AEV and AboitizPower, 

respectively, selects qualified nominees for election 

as directors. One consideration is the number of 

directorships a nominee has in other corporations 

or organizations. As a corporate practice, AEV  and 

AboitizPower  directors, including Independent 

Directors, are discouraged from sitting as directors in 

more than five publicly-listed companies (PLCs).

Executive Directors of AEV and AboitizPower do not 

generally sit on other boards of PLCs outside the 

Group, unless they have substantial interests in those 

PLCs or have been elected as independent directors. 

Both the AEV and AboitizPower Manuals require that 

the CEO and other executive directors shall submit 

themselves to a low active limit on membership in 

other corporate boards. In 2020, none of the AEV 

and AboitizPower directors sat in more than five 

PLCs.

Nomination, Selection, and Election of Directors

The Aboitiz Group believes that the nomination, 

selection, and election of directors are the 

fundamental elements of a well-functioning 

corporate governance system. AEV and AboitizPower 

both follow a formal and transparent board 

nomination, selection, and election process to 

ensure that the interests of all shareholders are 

protected.  Any shareholder may nominate a director 

and independent director. The ESCG Committees 

of AEV and AboitizPower act as the nomination 

committees and oversee the selection of candidates 

for their respective independent, executive, and 

non-executive directors. In determining the right 

candidates for directors, both AEV and AboitizPower 

may use professional search firms and external 

sources of candidates, including director databases 

and professional organizations in the Philippines or 

abroad. 

The members of the Boards of AEV and AboitizPower 

comply with the qualifications for directors found 

in the Revised Corporation Code, Securities and 

Regulation Code and its Implementing Rules 

and Regulations, related SEC issuances, and best 

practices in corporate governance. Considering that 

AEV and AboitizPower are involved in complex and 

highly regulated businesses, Board members are 

identified and nominated based on their wealth 

of experience, in-depth knowledge, wisdom, 

and capability to contribute to the long-term 

success of each company. The ESCG Committees 

of both companies, after rigorous screening of the 

candidates,  provide the final list of candidates for 

directors to each company’s Corporate Secretary, 

for inclusion in the ASM agenda. This gives 

the stockholders the opportunity to assess the 

background and qualifications of the nominees 

before the actual ASM. 

Every year during the ASMs, AEV and AboitizPower 

shareholders elect their representatives to the 

Boards by voting in person, by proxy, and - for the 

first time in 2020 - by voting in absentia. Proxy 

votes received by the Corporate Secretary of AEV 

and AboitizPower before the ASM are validated by 

each of the company’s Proxy Validation Committee. 

The members of the AEV and AboitizPower 

Proxy Validation Committees include each of 

the company’s compliance officer, its principal 

accounting officer, and the head of its internal audit 

team. 

AEV and AboitizPower both follow the rule of 

One-Share, One-Vote. Under this rule, any minority 

shareholder can influence the  Board composition 

by individual nomination and by the power of 

cumulative voting rights. The right to cumulative 

voting is a statutory right granted by the Revised 

Corporation Code. A director holds office for one 

year until his successor is elected at the next ASM, in 

accordance with the Revised Corporation Code, each 

company’s by-laws, and the relevant SEC guidelines. 

Virtual Annual Stockholders Meeting

The year 2020 brought with it the challenge of 

an unprecedented global pandemic. Business 

activities worldwide ground to a near standstill as 

governments imposed tight restrictions on travel and 

social gatherings to control the spread of COVID-19. 

Faced with these challenges, AEV and AboitizPower 

each held - for the first time ever - a Virtual ASM. 

Despite the difficulties posed by the community 

quarantine restrictions, both ASMs were held on 

schedule, and in a business-as-usual manner, without 

needing to avail  of the ASM extension period 

granted by the SEC to Philippine Companies. The 

notices for the 2020 ASM, information statements, 

and the annual reports were also distributed on 

time to stockholders, through all available channels, 

including via quick response (QR) code, electronic 

mail,  publication in newspapers of general 

circulation, and through each company’s respective 

websites. 

Driven by its commitment to practice sound 

corporate governance and guided by its core value 

of innovation, AEV and AboitizPower were able to 

provide an accessible and convenient venue for its 

shareholders to exercise their basic and inviolable 

right to elect their representatives to the Boards of 

Directors while remaining in the comfort and safety 

of their homes.

Conduct and Attendance at Board and Board 

Committee Meetings

The AEV and AboitizPower Board of Directors 

are expected to serve with diligence. In order to 

facilitate their attendance in meetings, the schedule 

for the regular Board and committee meetings for 

the upcoming year is approved and circulated to 

members before the start of the year. Directors  are 

not only expected to attend meetings but to actively 

participate by providing valuable professional 

counsel, strategic guidance, and constructive 

feedback. The  timely distribution of meeting 

materials within five days before  each Board or 

committee meeting ensures the directors’ active 

participation. 

Despite COVID-related travel restrictions in 2020, 

the AEV and AboitizPower Boards continued to 

discharge their  duties and responsibilities. Board 

and committee activities remained business as usual. 

Meetings were conducted through a secure video-

conferencing platform that allowed  each member 

to interact and participate remotely. Like in previous 

years, meeting materials were circulated to Board  

members through a secure digital platform at least 

five days before the meeting. Meeting protocols 

were  regularly reviewed and modified for more 

efficient virtual Board and committee meetings.

Continuous Learning

AEV and AboitizPower believe that their  directors 

should remain abreast with current industry devel-

opments and business trends in order to promote 

the Group’s competitiveness. It is equally important 

that all directors are aware of their duties and re-

sponsibilities, and provided with all the information 

needed to discharge their functions.

The AEV and AboitizPower Revised Manuals require 

every director to (i) undergo an initial onboarding 

session upon first appointment to the Board, and (ii) 

commit to a continuing professional training program 

(formal and informal) to be kept updated on recent 

developments in internal policies, relevant laws and 

regulations, and various business risks relevant to 

the Group. The Chairmen of both  Boards, with the 

assistance of their respective Compliance Officer,  

Board Performance Assessment

The AEV and AboitizPower Boards of Directors 

conduct an annual performance assessment of their 

members and key officers. Each director conducts a 

self-assessment on the individual and the collective 

performance of each member of the Board and 

Board committees. In addition, each director 

evaluates the performance of their  respective 

Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Internal Audit 

Head, Risk Officer, and Compliance Officer. In turn, 

select key officers of AEV and AboitizPower are 

anonymously asked to evaluate the performance of 

each of their respective companies’ Board directors. 

The assessment forms are prepared and regularly 

reviewed by the Compliance Officers  to elicit relevant 

and valuable insights on the following assessment 

criteria: (1) compliance with best governance practices 

and principles; (2) participation and contribution 

ensure that directors and key officers comply with 

these requirements.

On September 9, 2020, the Aboitiz Group conducted, 

as scheduled, its Annual In-House Corporate Gover-

nance Seminar. The seminar was held virtually  for 

the first time  and the online platform provided a 

safe and convenient venue for the Group’s directors 

and key officers, to listen to and interact with experts 

from different parts of the globe regarding current 

and relevant corporate governance issues. The webi-

nar was accredited and the proceedings monitored 

by representatives from the SEC. In 2020, all of the 

AEV and AboitizPower directors and officers attend-

ed a corporate governance seminar in compliance 

with the SEC’s Code of Corporate Governance.

In 2020, the directors and officers attended the fol-

lowing seminars and learning sessions:

to the Board and committee meetings; and (3) 

performance of their duties and responsibilities as 

provided in the company’s Revised Manuals, Charters, 

Amended Articles, and Amended By Laws. 

In addition, AEV and AboitizPower directors are 

evaluated by their respective key officers based 

on the following criteria: (1) business acumen, (2) 

independent judgment, (3) familiarity with the 

business, (4) active participation and effective 

challenge, (5) professional expertise and network, 

(6) value contribution, (7) embodiment of Aboitiz 

core values, and (8) reputation. Assessment results 

are presented to the respective ESCG Committees 

as part of the nomination and selection process of 

incumbent Board members. 

The Corporate Governance Code and the Revised 

Manuals requires that at least once in every three

assessment must be supported by an independent 

third party facilitator. In 2020, AEV and AboitizPower 

engaged the Good Governance Advocates and 

Practitioners of the Philippines (GGAPP), an 

independent association of corporate governance 

practitioners, to support their  Board performance 

assessment exercise. The results of the assessment, 

as well as the recommendations from GGAPP, were 

presented and discussed at the ESCG Committee 

meetings on February 16, 2021. 

Remuneration Policy

The ESCG Committees of AEV and AboitizPower 

ensure that the remuneration for directors and key 

executives is consistent with the Group’s culture, 

strategy, and business policies. Remuneration rates 

are also maintained at a level sufficient to attract 

and retain directors and officers who are needed 

to successfully run their respective companies. 

The Group engages the services of independent 

remuneration consultants to determine the 

compensation, as well as any annual salary increases, 

for directors, officers, and team members. Guided by 

the Aboitiz Compensation Philosophy, factors such 

as individual and organizational performance, and 

inflation, among others, are taken into account to 

ensure that the compensation structure will attract, 

retain, and engage the best talents to contribute to 

the success of the business. Each year, the results 

of the study are presented and discussed during the 

first meeting of the ESCG Committees of AEV and 

AboitizPower.

AEV and AboitizPower directors receive a monthly 

allowance of PHP150,000.00 each, while the 

Chairman of the Board receives a monthly allowance 

of PHP200,000.00. In addition, the directors 

receive a per diem for every Board or Board 

Committee meeting attended based on the following 

compensation structure: 

In no case has each Board’s ’s total yearly 

compensation exceeded 10% of their respective 

company’s net income before income tax of the 

preceding year. In 2020, the directors received the 

following compensation: 

BOARD COMMITTEES

The Environmental, Social, and Corporate 

Governance Committees (formerly the Corporate 

Governance Committee) of AEV and AboitizPower 

are responsible for developing and recommending to 

their respective Board of Directors the appropriate 

governance principles applicable to the whole Group. 

The ESCG Committees also perform the functions 

of the Nomination and Remuneration Committees. 

In carrying out their  duties and responsibilities, the 

ESCG Committee is supported by the company’s 

Compliance Officer, Chief External Relations Officer, 

as well as the Group Chief Human Resources Officer. 

These officers regularly attend committee meetings 

to act as resource persons. The chairmen of the ESCG 

Committees are the Lead Independent Directors.

In 2020, the Board ESCG continued to (1) review and 

monitor AEV and AboitizPower compliance with new 

laws and regulations (the Revised Corporation Code, 

various SEC and BIR issuances, among others); (2) 

review and update the Revised Manual to align with 

the best practices in the Integrated Annual Corporate 

Governance Report and the ASEAN Corporate 

Governance Scorecard; and (3) ensure that the 

nomination, selection, election, remuneration, and 

assessment of each company’s directors and officers 

are aligned with the Revised Manual. In the same 

year, the committees amended their respective 

Revised Manuals and Charters to establish a Board 

oversight and governance framework to promote 

and integrate the sustainability and corporate 

governance initiatives of AEV and AboitizPower. 

The Audit Committees continued to provide 

oversight over AEV and AboitizPower financial 

reporting policies, practices and controls, and over 

the internal and external audit functions necessary 

for making good audit-related decisions. In 2020, 

the Audit Committee updated its Charter to improve 

the Company’s control performance by having an 

adequate and effective control system.

Chaired by independent directors, the Audit 

Committees are composed of all three independent 

directors and two non-executive directors. Each

Sufficiency of Internal Control 

and Compliance System

The AEV and AboitizPower Audit Committees 

assist their respective Boards in fulfilling  oversight 

responsibilities over their company’s system 

of internal control. They are  responsible for 

monitoring, overseeing, and evaluating the duties 

and responsibilities of management, the internal 

audit activity, and the external auditors as those 

duties and responsibilities relate to the organization’s 

processes for controlling its operations. In 2020, 

the President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief 

Financial Officer, and Internal Audit Head of AEV 

and AboitizPower attested to the sufficient  internal 

control and compliance system of their respective 

companies.  

Audit and Non-Audit Fees

The Independent External Auditor of AEV and 

AboitizPower is the accounting firm of SyCip Gorres 

Velayo &amp; Co. (SGV), with Ms. Maria Veronica Andresa 

R. Pore as current audit partner  who  has served 

since  2017. As a policy, the Board Audit Committee 

makes recommendations to the Board concerning 

the choice of external auditor and pre-approves 

audit plans, scope, and frequency before the audit 

is conducted. Audit services of external auditors 

for the years 2020 and 2019 were pre-approved by 

the Board Audit Committee. The Committee also 

reviewed the extent and nature of these services 

to ensure that the independence of the external 

auditors is preserved. The breakdown of the audit 

and non-audit fees paid by AEV and AboitizPower to 

their respective auditors are found in the companies’ 

Information Statements and Annual Reports. 

The Risk and Reputation Committees exercise 

oversight functions over each company’s (i)  

enterprise risk management and (ii) reputation 

management, including their respective corporate 

brands and communication strategies. In 2020, the 

Board Risk and Reputation Committees updated their 

charter to continually identify, monitor, and manage 

the Group’s top risks.

The Related Party Transactions (RPT) Committees 

of AEV and AboitizPower are composed entirely of 

independent directors. In 2020, these committees 

approved the Revised RPT Policy and Charter of each 

company in compliance with the SEC memorandum 

circular on Material RPTs. In addition, they continued 

to review and approve each company’s CFO 

Guidelines on the Implementation of the RPT Policy, 

which requires all directors and officers to execute 

a certification to identify their related parties to be 

able to identify potential conflicts of interest. 

In 2020, AEV and AboitizPower updated the RPT 

Certification for Directors and Officers in compliance 

with  the Bureau of Internal Revenue Regulation 

No. 19-2020 on the reporting guidelines for the 

transactions of individuals and juridical entities with 

related parties. The RPT Committees continued to 

ensure that related party transactions are taken 

on an arm’s-length basis and within market rates, 

with sufficient documentation, and coursed through 

the appropriate levels of approval. Except for the 

presence of the AEV and AboitizPower CFOs as 

resource persons, management is not invited to and 

has no participation in the RPT Committee. 

The Executive Committees of AEV and AboitizPower 

were organized in May 2018 and are composed 

of five regular members, with at least two   non-

executive directors. The committees were  formed to 

assist the Board in the management and oversight of 

each company’s day-to-day operations and strategic 

decision–making during the intervening period 

between full Board meetings. The President and CEO 

of  AEV and AboitizPower are the chairmen of their 

respective Executive Committees.

GOVERNANCE PRACTICES

Disclosure and Transparency

The Governance and Compliance Team, as well as 

the  Board Secretariat,  of AEV and AboitizPower 

monitor and timely disclose any changes in the share 

ownership of their respective directors, executives, 

and key officers.  They also  ensure that trading 

blackouts are implemented at the right time and to 

appropriate individuals. 

Every quarter, AEV and AboitizPower disclose 

a public ownership report detailing the extent 

of ownership of their respective controlling 

shareholders, including the shareholdings of 

subsidiaries and affiliates, and of directors and key 

officers. In addition, the two  companies disclose a 

list of their top 100 shareholders every quarter. They 

also disclose their top 20 shareholders, including 

record and beneficial shareholders owning more 

than five percent of their respective outstanding 

capital stock. Both companies, however, have no 

control over external shareholders who opt to put 

their shares under nominee holding companies 

such as the PCD Nominee Corporation, and are thus 

unable to make any disclosure on the details of 

beneficial ownership.

Transactions of Directors and Officers

AEV and AboitizPower disclose the beneficial ownership of their  directors and key officers in regular filings 

of the Statement of Beneficial Ownership and in the Integrated Annual Corporate Governance Report. The 

Revised General Trading Policies of both companies require the Board of Directors and officers to notify 

the Office of the Corporate Secretary immediately after they deal in company shares. As of December 31, 

2020, the directors and key officers of AEV and AboitizPower own the following shares:

Directors.  Whistleblowers have the option to  address  complaints to any of the following 

officers: Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief Executive Officer, Lead 

Independent Director, Compliance Officer, or Internal Audit Head. It is noteworthy that no 

corruption-related incidents were reported in 2020.

General Trading 

Policy

The Revised General Trading Policy supplements the commitment under the Codes 

to prevent the misuse of inside information, and emphasizes reporting and disclosing 

material information, and the rule on prohibited insider trading. 

As listed companies, AEV and AboitizPower are required to report transactions of 

company shares by their directors and officers. To ensure the strict compliance with this 

requirement, directors and officers are advised of their disclosure obligations during their 

onboarding with the Group. The Compliance Officer also sends out a monthly reminder to 

directors and officers to disclose their transactions. 

The trading policies of AEV and AboitizPower prohibit any misuse of insider information. 

All team members are mandated to exercise prudence in handling material non-public 

information in the course of their work, and in relation to the trading or dealing with 

AEV and AP securities. Both companies strictly enforce their trading blackout and insider 

trading policy to curtail opportunistic dealings in company shares. Violations should be 

reported to the Compliance Officer and the Board ESCG. Since the last amendment of 

the Trading Policies in 2017, there has been no reported investigation of violation and 

conviction of insider trading, as well as abusive self-dealing by directors, management, 

and employees. 

In 2020, there was no reported incident of non-compliance with the General Trading 

Policies.

Related Party 

Transactions (RPT) 

Policy

In October 2019, the AEV and AboitizPower Boards approved the RPT Policy in compliance 

with the SEC Memorandum Circular No. 10 series of 2019. The new rule focuses and 

regulates only material RPTs or RPTs amounting to 10% or higher of a company’s total 

assets. The new rule also specified an approval process for material RPTs and mandated 

publicly-listed companies to notify the SEC of their RPTs that breach the threshold. AEV 

and AboitizPower RPT Committees have the mandate to ensure that RPTs are taken on an 

arms’-length basis and within market rates, with sufficient documentation, and coursed 

through all appropriate levels of necessary approvals. Each company’s current revised RPT 

Policy continues to  ensure that RPTs are conducted at arm’s length and at market prices, 

and underwent the appropriate approval process. 

In 2020, AEV and AboitizPower did not enter into any material RPTs  and there was no 

reported case of non-compliance with the laws, rules and regulations pertaining to 

significant or material RPTs. 

Key Company Policies 

Key Company Policies 

Conflict of Interest 

Policy

AEV and AboitizPower believe that it is the duty of the Board of Directors to advance 

the Group’s interests and those of the companies’ stakeholders. To this end, the two 

companies  have each adopted a Policy on Conflict of Interest, which promotes an ethical 

corporate culture and prohibits directors, officers, team leaders, and team members from 

taking advantage of access to corporate property and proprietary information for personal 

gain. The policy  requires the disclosure of relationships, actions, or transactions that may 

give rise to a conflict of interest. In addition, AEV and AboitizPower directors are required 

to abstain or inhibit themselves from any Board discussion or decision that affects or has 

relevance or relation to their personal, business, or professional interests. The companies’ 

directors are also prohibited from engaging in any business that competes with or is 

antagonistic to the Group. They must notify the Board, through their respective Corporate 

Secretaries, before accepting any directorship outside the Aboitiz Group during their term.

Data Privacy 

Policy

In 2017, the AEV launched its data privacy compliance program, which includes the 

implementation of the Information Security Management System (ISMS) for the entire 

Aboitiz Group. Since then, the Group has  been able to establish a fundamental awareness 

of data privacy principles and the related ISMS philosophies, through various learning 

channels including e-learning modules, face-to- face trainings and forums. AEV and 

AboitizPower continue to ensure the implementation of Data Privacy Policies, manuals, 

and supporting guidelines that  are aligned with the Data Privacy Act, including its 

implementing rules and supporting National Privacy Commission (NPC) circulars.

In 2020, AEV initiated the integrated approach to information security incident 

management, which brought together experts in such subject matters as  Data Privacy, 

Information Security, IT Security, Business Continuity, Human Resources, and Legal.   This 

brings a more holistic approach to the handling of information security and data breach 

incidents.

 

As the Aboitiz Group continues to operate in a highly digital and fast-changing 

environment, the Data Protection Teams of each Business will strive to keep up with the 

expectations of their Data Subjects, as well as with the evolving guidelines of the NPC. 

This constant review of requirements, downloading of information, updating of processes, 

and testing of capabilities aims to ensure that Aboitiz is able to meet the expectations of 

stakeholders.

Disclosure Policy

To supplement the implementation of the Codes and in compliance with laws and 

regulations, AEV and AboitizPower each have a Disclosure Policy that requires complete, 

timely, and accurate disclosures to the SEC, the PSE, and the PDEx. Each company’s Board 

Secretariat ensures compliance with the disclosure rules. In 2020, there were no reported 

cases of non-compliance with the disclosure rules of the SEC, the PSE, and the PDEx. In 

addition, despite the extension provided by the SEC to all PLCs, AEV and AboitizPower 

submitted and disclosed their  Annual Reports, Financial Statements, Sustainability 

Reports, and Information Statements on their original statutory deadlines.

Economic, Social, and Environmental Impact

The Aboitiz Group remains committed to support 

economic growth, social development, and 

environmental stewardship in the conduct of its 

businesses. The concept of balance between planet, 

people, and profit is not a new  concept on how the 

Aboitiz Group operates its businesses. Advocacy and 

adherence to environmental sustainability and care 

for stakeholders have always been part of the Aboitiz 

Way – living the core value of Responsibility. In 2020, 

AEV and AboitizPower officially established an ESG 

governance structure to integrate existing corporate 

social responsibility, corporate governance, and 

environmental sustainability programs. The  goal 

is  to create  an integrated approach in developing, 

implementing, monitoring, and communicating 

initiatives and results to the Group’s  internal and 

external stakeholders.

The Aboitiz  Integrated Sustainability Report outlines 

the coordinated efforts of the Group’s sustainability 

stewards and  applying  ESG principles to improve 

the Group’s performance on team member 

engagement and development, corporate social 

responsibility, customer focus, disaster resilience, 

carbon emissions reduction, resource efficiency, 

renewable energy, waste management, financial 

growth, and financial returns. The Sustainability 

Reports of AEV and AboitizPower are available 

for viewing and downloading at www.aboitiz.

sustainability.

Transparency, Communication, and Sustainability 

Reporting

The Aboitiz Group’s governance framework includes 

the timely, complete, and accurate disclosure 

of all material information regarding AEV and 

AboitizPower. Information includes earnings results, 

acquisitions or disposals of assets, Board changes, 

RPTs, shareholdings of directors, and changes in 

ownership. In addition, the Group’s Consolidated 

Annual and Sustainability Report, which is based on 

GRI Sustainability Reporting standards, sets out its 

values and governance model. The integrated report 

links the Group’s strategy and its commitment to 

a sustainable global economy. Through the report, 

the Group is able to measure, understand, and 

communicate its economic, environmental, social 

and governance performance. From these, goals can 

then be set, and change managed more effectively. 

In 2020, the Board of Directors of AEV and 

AboitizPower approved the proposed governance 

framework needed to organize, cascade, manage, 

and communicate the Group’s  ESG initiatives to its 

internal and external stakeholders.

Rights of Shareholders

Shareholder rights are of paramount importance 

in the AEV and AboitizPower By-laws, Codes, 

and Revised Manuals. The goal is to ensure the 

protection of shareholder interests and concerns 

through the free exercise of shareholder rights. 

Among the rights of shareholders, regardless of 

the number of shares they own, are: to receive 

notices of and to attend shareholders’ meetings; 

to participate and vote on the basis of the one-

share, one-vote policy; nominate and elect Board 

members (including via cumulative voting); inspect 

corporate books and records; vote in person or in 

absentia through proxy; receive dividends; and ratify 

corporate action. 

AEV and AboitizPower  believe that the rights and 

interests of minority shareholders are aligned with 

those of the controlling shareholders, not only in 

terms of returns on their investments, but also 

in the sustainability of the Group’s businesses.  

Both companies ensure the timely disclosure to 

shareholders regarding their respective businesses, 

and that shareholders receive dividends in 

accordance with established dividend policies. 

The Board Secretariat has adopted certified 

Board protocols and procedures under the ISO 

9001:2015 Management Board and System to 

ensure the effectiveness of Board and shareholders’ 

commitments. This includes coordination with stock 

transfer agents to ensure appropriate responses and 

the timely resolution of shareholders’ queries and 

requests.

Right to Dividends

Every year, AEV and AboitizPower pay dividends in 

an equitable and timely manner. All shareholders are 

treated equally, receiving an amount of dividends per 

share that is proportionate to their shareholdings. The 

period for payment of dividends is based on trading 

requirements or constraints of the SEC and PSE.

Right to Participate in Fundamental Corporate Changes

As a matter of policy, AEV and AboitizPower 

encourage the active participation of  shareholders 

in corporate decisions, such as amendments to  the 

Articles of Incorporation and By-laws, appointment 

of auditors, and the approval of audited financial 

statements, among others. 

At the ASM, the Board of Directors present and 

submit to the shareholders the proposed actions 

for approval. The shareholders are also given an 

opportunity to ask questions regarding the proposed 

actions during the meeting. Only upon receipt of the 

affirmative vote of shareholders representing at least 

2/3 of the issued and outstanding capital stock of 

each company, will such action be considered as duly 

approved by the shareholders.

Attendees to these meetings also include the Group Internal Audit Head and, by invitation, the Chief Risk Officer, the Chief 

Financial Officer, Controller and other key leaders whenever deemed necessary or appropriate.

One-on-one sessions with between the Board Audit Committee Chairman and the AEV Group Internal Audit head are held 

as needed.

Financial Reports

The Board Audit Committee reviewed, discussed, and approved for public disclosure the 2020 quarterly unaudited 

consolidated financial statements. The Committee endorsed for approval by the full Board the 2020 annual audited 

financial statements of Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc., its subsidiaries and alliances. Included in the review were the 

Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations following prior review and 

discussion with management, accounting, and the company’s independent external auditor, SyCip Gorres Velayo &amp; Co. 

(SGV)—member practice of Ernst &amp; Young (EY) in the Philippines.

The activities of the Audit Committee are performed in the context—

•  

That management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the financial reporting process; 

and

•  

That the company’s independent external auditor is responsible for expressing an unqualified opinion on 

the conformity and consistency of application of the Company’s audited financial statements with Philippine 

Financial Reporting Standards.

External Auditors

Upon the endorsement of the Audit Committee to the Board which, in turn, sought the approval of the shareholders of 

Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc., during its Annual General Stockholders Meeting held last April 27, 2020, SyCip Gorres Velayo 

&amp; Co. (SGV) was re-appointed as the independent external auditor for 2020 with Maria Veronica Andresa R. Pore as the 

signing partner for SGV.

The overall scope and audit plan of SGV were reviewed and approved during the October 28, 2020 regular Audit Committee 

meeting. The audit plan, fees and terms of engagement which covers audit-related services provided by SGV were also 

reviewed and found to be reasonable. 

The results of the SGV audits and its assessment of the overall quality of the financial reporting process were presented 

and discussed during the first Audit Committee meeting the following year, March 3, 2021. SGV presented the effects of 

changes in relevant accounting standards and presentation of financial statements that impact on the reported results. 

Non-audit services were provided by SGV in 2020 but limited to the conduct of trainings with regard to the adoption of 

new accounting standards and tax regulations.

The Board Audit Committee, after evaluation of the performance of the external auditor in 2020 and finding it to be in 

accordance with the Standards, favorably endorsed to the full Board the re-appointment of SGV as external auditor for 

2021.

Internal Auditors

The Audit Committee is satisfied with the internal audit function and has assessed that it is operating effectively and to 

generally cover the risks pertinent to the company in its audits. The Committee has reviewed and approved the annual 

audit program for the year which also covers the adequacy of resources, qualifications and competency of the staff and 

independence of the internal auditor.

With reference to the IPPF Attribute Standard 1100 which states that “The Internal Audit Activity must be independent, 

and internal auditors must be objective in performing their work.”, the Committee confirms that the function is 

executed effectively and internal auditors have conducted their responsibilities objectively and in an unbiased manner. 

The Committee further confirms that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the auditors have no personal or other 

impediments that would prevent them from objectively planning, conducting, reporting, or otherwise participating and 

reaching independent conclusions in their audit assignments in 2020. Internal audit is organizationally positioned to 

be independent—functionally reporting to the Board Audit Committee and administratively to the President and Chief 

Executive Officer.

The Board Audit Committee is pleased to present its report for the financial year ended

December 31, 2020.

Audit Committee Responsibility

In giving effect to its duly approved charter, the Audit Committee assisted the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight 

responsibility to the public, governmental and/or regulatory bodies and other stakeholders in helping:

a)  Ensure the integrity of the Company’s financial reporting processes, including ensuring the integrity of financial 

reports and other financial information provided by the Company to the public, governmental and/or regulatory 

bodies;

b)  Ensure excellence in the Company’s control performance by having an adequate and effective internal control 

system, governance processes and risk management processes and reviewing the performance on the Company’s 

internal audit function;

c)  Review the annual independent audit of the Company’s financial statements and the external auditors’ 

qualifications and independence;

d)  Ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations which may represent material financial exposure to the 

Company; and

e)  Provide an avenue of communication among the Company’s independent auditors, management, the internal 

auditing department and the Company.

The Committee has established a constructive and collaborative relationship with the Company’s senior leadership to give 

support, but not to pre-empt any responsibility in making final audit-related decisions.

Committee Membership

The Audit Committee is composed of five (5) members, three (3) of whom are independent directors including its Chairman.

Jose C. Vitug, a retired Justice of the Supreme Court (an Independent Director) is the Chairman of the Committee. Other 

members of the committee are Atty. Raphael P. M. Lotilla (Independent Director), Manuel R. Salak III (Independent 

Director), Erramon I. Aboitiz (Non- Executive Director) and Ana Maria A. Delgado (Non-Executive Director).

Meetings and Attendance

The Audit Committee carried out its function through its meetings with management, internal auditors, independent 

external auditors, advisers, and others where appropriate.

The audit charter provides for the Committee to hold at least four (4) regular meetings a year, with the authority to 

convene special meetings when deemed required. It also holds an annual joint meeting with the Board Risk and Reputation 

Management Committee.

In 2020, five (5) meetings were held. The attendance by each member of the committee is as so indicated below:


Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc.

Annual and Sustainability Report 2020

The Board Audit Committee is satisfied with the content and quality of reports prepared and issued by the internal 

auditors during the year under review.

The Group Internal Audit (GIA) remains to be the single-point-of-contact for the Audit Committee. It takes the lead in 

setting the standards, initiatives and overall direction of the group audit teams which, in turn, focus their reviews on 

the top risks of their respective business units. Except for the banks and other financial business units, information 

systems and technology-related risks however, still remain to be an area covered by the Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc. group 

information systems auditors.

Based on audit reports and highlights presented to the Committee and with the contribution provided by management 

and other key leaders on the issues raised to their attention, the Committee concurs with internal audit’s assessment 

that, generally, there is reasonable assurance that the existing system of internal controls, risk management and 

governance allowfor a generally adequate management of identified risks and effectively supports the improvement of 

the management of the Company as a whole. There is a need, however, to improve and further strengthen governance 

and controls over the implementation of security standards for information systems and related technologies particularly 

in relation to cybersecurity risks.

In its meeting held March 3, 2021, the Committee brought to the attention of the board the seriousness of cybersecurity 

risks to the group. The Committee discussed the performance of a full independent external cybersecurity review for AEV 

in 2021. This was endorsed to the full board and approved in its meeting held March 5, 2021. Relatedly, learning sessions 

with management and the board on cybersecurity will be conducted to further complement initiatives of the company 

in this area.

External Quality Assessment

The Internal Audit team of Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc., after undergoing an External Quality Assessment (EQA) review by 

the authorized validators of the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) Philippines that are duly accredited by the Institute of 

Internal Auditors (IIA) International, received the official EQAR results in 2017.

It is the opinion of the IIA that on the overall, the internal audit team of Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc., “Generally Conforms” 

to the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing and the Code of Ethics for internal audit 

practitioners. Generally Conforms is the highest rating awarded in connection with an EQA and the internal audit team 

has been commended for this achievement.

The EQA, much like any global certification is not required. Acquiring it helps build the reputation not just of internal audit 

but of Aboitiz as a company that not only conforms, complies and follows but adopts and implements the Standards and 

best practices of the internal audit function. The EQA certification is valid for 5 years till 2022. Until then, internal audit will 

ensure that it continually works on its Quality Assurance Improvement Program and apply it across the group.

Review of the Audit Charters

Annual review and updating of the Board Audit Committee charter was conducted. Changes were discussed by the 

Committee in its October 28, 2020 quarterly meeting. The Committee endorsed the revised charter for full Board approval. 

The AEV Board approved the revised Board Audit Committee charter in its meeting held on November 4, 2020. The 

changes reinforced the oversight responsibilities of the Board Audit Committee in helping ensure excellence in control 

performance by having an adequate and effective internal control system, governance and risk management processes. It 

likewise include among its oversight duties and responsibilities the establishment of a fraud response plan.

Additionally, these changes are in compliance with the latest governmental issuances. The review and updating of the 

charters are done at least once a year, endorsed by the Audit Committee, approved by the Board and included in the 

report to the stockholders. 

Self-Assessment

The Committee conducted its annual self-assessment in accordance with the guidelines of SEC Memo Cir. No. 4, series of 

2012. The assessment result showed that it fully complied with the requirements set forth in the Audit Charter and met 

the necessary and most important requirements set by global standards and best practices.

Risk Management

The partnership between the functions of risk management and internal audit has remained solid. In order to continuously 

provide objective assurance to the board on the effectiveness of risk management, a joint audit and risk committee 

meeting is held at least once a year.

Presented in the October 26, 2020 joint meeting are the top strategic risks, emerging risks and project risks that present 

a significant impact to the Company’s ability to execute its plans, strategies and business objectives for the following year. 

These top risks serve as an input for the preparation of internal audit’s master plan for the following year.

The joint meeting between the Board Audit and Risk Committees also provide an avenue to present the annual results of 

the Risk Management Plan validation reviews conducted by the internal audit teams across the group. The reviews give 

an assurance to management and the Board on the status of the risk treatments planned to address the identified risks 

for the year.

After considering, analyzing and reviewing all pertinent information on the integrity of financial reporting, effectiveness of 

internal controls, risk management, governance and compliance within the Aboitiz group of companies, the Committee is 

of the view that, in all material aspects, the duties and responsibilities as so outlined in its Charter have been satisfactorily 

performed.

Attendees to these meetings also include the 1AP Group Internal Audit Head, Aboitiz Group Internal Audit Head, and, 

by invitation, the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller and other key leaders when deemed appropriate.

Regular one-on-one sessions of 1AP Internal Audit Head with the Chairman of the Board Audit Committee prior to every 

scheduled Board Audit Committee meeting are also conducted.

Financial Reports

The Board Audit Committee reviewed, discussed, and approved for public disclosure the 2020 quarterly unaudited 

consolidated financial statements and endorsed for approval by the full Board the 2020 annual audited financial 

statements of Aboitiz Power Corp., its subsidiaries and alliances.  Included in the review were the Management Discussion 

and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations following prior review and discussion with management, 

accounting, and the company’s independent external auditor, SyCip Gorres Velayo &amp; Co. (SGV) – a member practice of 

Ernst &amp; Young (EY) in the Philippines.

The activities of the Board Audit Committee are performed in the context –

•  

That management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the financial reporting process; 

and

• 

That the company’s independent external auditor is responsible for expressing an unqualified opinion on 

the conformity and consistency of application of the Company’s audited financial statements with Philippine 

Financial Reporting Standards.

External Auditors

Upon endorsement of the Board Audit Committee to the full Board which, in turn, sought the approval of the shareholders 

of Aboitiz Power Corp., during its Annual General Stockholders Meeting held last April 27, 2020, SyCip Gorres Velayo &amp; Co. 

(SGV) was re-appointed as the independent external auditor for 2020 with Maria Veronica Andresa R. Pore as the signing 

partner for SGV.

The overall scope and audit plan of SGV were reviewed and approved during the October 28, 2020 regular Board Audit 

Committee meeting.  The audit plan, fees and terms of engagement which covers audit-related services provided by SGV 

were also reviewed and found to be reasonable.

The results of the SGV audits and its assessment of the overall quality of the financial reporting process were presented 

and discussed during the first Audit Committee meeting the following year, March 3, 2021.   

In 2020, the Company also engaged SGV to conduct post reviews and other procedures for the purpose of issuing a 

comfort letter in connection with the issuance of the PHP9.55 bn in retail bonds. 

Internal Auditors

The Board Audit Committee is satisfied with the internal audit function and had assessed that it is operating effectively 

and is able to generally cover the relevant risks pertinent to the company in its audits.   The Committee has reviewed 

and approved the annual audit program for the year which also covers the adequacy of resources, qualifications and 

competencies of the staff, and independence of the internal auditor.

With reference to the International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF) Attribute Standard 1100 which states that 

“The Internal Audit Activity must be independent, and internal auditors must be objective in performing their work.”, 

the Board Audit Committee confirms that the function is executed effectively and internal auditors have conducted their 

responsibilities objectively and in an unbiased manner.  The Committee further confirms that, to the best of its knowledge 

and belief, the auditors have no personal or other impairments that would prevent them from objectively planning, 

conducting, reporting, or otherwise participating and reaching independent conclusions in their audit assignments 

in 2020.  Internal audit is organizationally positioned to be independent – functionally reporting to the Board Audit 

Committee and administratively to the President and Chief Executive Officer.

The Board Audit Committee is satisfied with the content and quality of reports prepared and issued by the internal 

auditors during the year under review.

The 1AP Group Internal Audit remains to be the single-point-of-contact for the Board Audit Committee.  It takes the lead 

in setting the standards, initiatives and overall direction of the audit team which, in turn, focus its reviews on the top risks 

of respective business units.  

Information systems and technology-related risks, however, still remain to be an area mostly covered by the Aboitiz group 

information systems auditors in 2020. 

In line with the strategic intent of the Group Internal Audit to gradually decentralize the Information Systems Audit starting 

2020 to 2022, 1AP internal audit had covered information systems related risks in their 2020 engagements as identified 

and agreed with Aboitiz Group IT/IS Team.

Based on audit reports and highlights presented to the Board Audit Committee and with the contribution provided by 

management and other key leaders on the issues raised to their attention, the Board Audit Committee concurs with 

internal audit’s assessment that, generally, there is reasonable assurance that the existing system of internal controls, 

risk management and governance allow for a generally adequate management of identified risks and effectively supports 

the improvement of the management of the Company as a whole.  There is a need, however, to further strengthen 

governance and controls over security standards for information and related technologies particularly in relation to cyber-

security risks. 

External Quality Assessment

The 1AP Internal Audit team with offices in Manila and Cebu, after undergoing the External Quality Assessment (EQA) 

review by the authorized validators of the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) Philippines that are duly accredited by the 

Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) International, received the official EQAR results early 2017.

It is the opinion of the IIA that on the overall, the internal audit team of Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc., “Generally Conforms” 

to the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing and the Code of Ethics for internal audit 

practitioners. Generally Conforms is the highest rating awarded in connection with an EQA and the internal audit team 

has been commended for this achievement.

Acquiring the EQA global certification helps build the reputation not just of internal audit but of Aboitiz Power Corp. as 

a company that not only conforms, complies and follows but adopts and implements the International Standards for the 

Professional Practice of Internal Auditing.  The EQA certification is valid for 5 years until 2022.  Until then, 1AP Group 

Internal Audit ensures that it continually works on its Quality Assurance Improvement Program by doing its interim self-

assessment annually.

Review of the Audit Charters

Annual review and updating of the Board Audit Committee Charter was conducted.   Changes were discussed by the 

Committee in its October 28, 2020 quarterly meeting and the Committee had endorsed to the full Board for approval.  

The AP Board approved the revised Board Audit Committee Charter in its November 3, 2020 regular board meeting.  

The changes reinforced the oversight responsibilities of the board audit committee in ensuring excellence in control 

performance by having an adequate and effective internal control system, governance and risk management processes.  

It likewise include among its oversight duties and responsibilities the establishment of a fraud response plan.

The review and updating of the Internal Audit Team Charter are also done annually, and approved by the Board Audit 

Committee.  

Self-Assessment

The Board Audit Committee conducted its annual self-assessment in accordance with the guidelines of SEC Memo Circular 

No. 4, series of 2012.  The assessment results showed that it fully complied with the requirements set forth in the Audit 

Charter and met the necessary and most important requirements set by global standards and best practices.

Risk Management

The partnership between the functions of risk management and audit has remained solid.  In order to continuously 

provide objective assurance to the Board on the effectiveness of risk management, a Joint Audit and Risk &amp; Reputation 

Committee meeting is held at least once a year.

195

Presented in the joint meeting last October 26, 2020 are the top strategic risks that present a significant impact to the 

Company’s ability to execute its plans and strategies as well as to achieve its business objectives.  

These top risks are among the relevant factors in consideration for the preparation of the internal audit’s master plan for 

the following year.

Results of the 2020 series of existence validation review by internal audit on risk management or treatment plans 

identified and implemented by the different business units across AP as of October 2020 were likewise presented in the 

October 26, 2020 joint Board Audit and Risk &amp; Reputation Committee meeting.  Assurance is given when results of the 

review show that majority of the risk management or treatment plans generally were either acted upon (done) or being 

addressed (in-progress).

After considering, analyzing and reviewing all pertinent information to the integrity of financial reporting, adequacy of 

internal controls, risk management, governance and compliance within Aboitiz Power Corp. and its affiliated companies, 

the Committee is of the view that, in all material aspects, the duties and responsibilities as so outlined in its Charter have 

been satisfactorily performed.

In behalf of the AP Board Audit Committee,

(SGD) Carlos C. Ejercito

Independent Director

Board Audit Committee Chairman

Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc.’s (AEV) corporate governance system includes a combination of internal and external Aboitiz 

Power Corporation (AP) corporate governance system includes a combination of internal and external mechanisms such

• 

SGV &amp; Co., the Company’s external auditor is responsible for assessing and expressing an opinion on the 

conformity of the audited financial statement with Philippine Financial Reporting Standards and the overall

• 

Internal Audit adopts a risk-based audit approach in developing an annual audit master plan and conducts 

reviews to assess the adequacy of the Company’s internal control system;

we attest that AEV’s internal control and compliance system, which covers governance, risk, and control processes, are 

generally adequate.

As long as we stay genuinely connected 

to our time-honored values of the 

Aboitiz Way, we will always be on the 

right track wherever the day takes us as 

a business and organization. Integrity, 

teamwork, innovation, and responsibility 

are embedded in us. Be aware that 

things will not remain the same as they 

are now. We must innovate, change and 

adapt to the times; doing things better, 

doing things differently. No one moves 

forward by staying in the same place.

Glance back, be inspired, and 

move forward. 

BOARDSPEAK

“

“

“

“

Sabin Aboitiz

Raphael Lotilla

Our past 200 years have taught me 

that there is only one value that covers 

all, and that is trust. Trust is achieved 

with clarity. There is only one skill that 

really matters—the timely adaptation 

to change. In escalating disruption, they 

both matter more than ever. 

“

“

Endika Aboitiz

Be open, embrace change, and evolve 

fast. We will never know what the future 

holds, but as long as we keep an open 

mind and remain ready to evolve with 

the times, we will not only survive, but 

thrive and continue the Aboitiz legacy of 

advancing business and communities for 

the next 100, or even 200 years. 

“

“

Manny Rubio

We are not in a hundred-meter sprint 

but in a 100-year marathon, and this 

marathon will be run in relays. Each 

generation builds and strengthens 

the Organization. Never lose heart 

when faced with challenges and 

failures. Learn and share the lessons 

and push on.

“

“

Carlos Ejercito

What is your advice to current and future 

Aboitiz team leaders and members for us 

to reach another 100 years?

What was achieved in the past 100 

years did not come easy. With the 

challenges we will face in the next 

100 years, perseverance will be a 

necessary ingredient. 

“

“

Erramon Aboitiz

Newton’s First Law of Motion: An object 

either remains at rest or continues to 

move at a constant velocity unless acted 

upon by an external force. Old ways won’t 

open up new doors. 

Second Law of Motion: F=MA. If you want 

to get an object accelerating in a particular 

direction, then the size of the force you 

apply and the direction of that force will 

both make a difference. Focus on the key 

drivers of growth and what matters for 

long-term growth and resiliency. Practice 

Polite Persistence. “Transform values into 

actions, visions into realities, obstacles into 

innovations, separateness into solidarity, 

and risks into rewards.”

Third Law of Motion: When one body 

exerts a force on a second body, the 

second body simultaneously exerts a 

force equal in magnitude and opposite 

in direction on the first body. “Example is 

not the main thing in influencing others. 

It is the only thing.” - Albert Schweitzer 

“

“

Mikel Aboitiz

Be open to change even if it is 

uncomfortable. It is unnerving because 

things will definitely change: how we 

work, our businesses, our society. Always 

keep a level head as we, as a team, 

continue to learn, adapt, adjust, innovate, 

and execute properly. There will certainly 

be missteps and failures. Learn from 

it and move on. Remember to always 

celebrate the wins, even the small ones.

“

“

Jim Aboitiz

Continuous self-reflection and growth are 

key to the long game. In the meantime, 

make up for our shortcomings with hard 

work and perseverance.

“

“

Danel Aboitiz

To thrive consistently over time, we need 

to be at the forefront of driving change. As 

leaders, this requires us to get comfortable 

in the uncomfortable and the uncertain. 

It is from this place of uncertainty and 

discomfort that the ideas that will lead us 

into the future will be birthed. 

“

“

Ana Delgado-Aboitiz

“Fire is the test of gold; adversity, 

of strong men.”-Seneca 

“

“

Romeo Bernardo

Always keep learning. Always keep 

innovating. Never settle for good 

enough. Never give up our core values 

of integrity, teamwork, innovation, and 

responsibility.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Aboitiz Equity Ventures, Inc.

Opinion

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Aboitiz Equity Ventures, Inc. and its

subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as at December 31, 2020 and

2019, and the consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of comprehensive income,

consolidated statements of changes in equity and consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the

three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and notes to the consolidated financial statements,

including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material

respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and its

consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the

period ended December 31, 2020 in accordance with Philippine Financial Reporting Standards (PFRSs).

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audits in accordance with Philippine Standards on Auditing (PSAs).  Our

responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the

Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.  We are independent of the Group

in accordance with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants in the Philippines (Code of Ethics)

together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial

statements in the Philippines, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with

these requirements and the Code of Ethics.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is

sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our

audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period.  These matters were addressed in

the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion

thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.  For each matter below, our

description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the

Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters.

Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment

of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements.  The results of our audit

procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our

audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Impairment Testing of Goodwill

Under PFRSs, the Group is required to annually test the amount of goodwill for impairment.  As of

December 31, 2020, the goodwill attributable to several cash-generating units (CGUs) amounted to

P=55.2 billion or 9% of total assets, which is considered significant to the consolidated financial

statements.  In addition, management’s assessment process requires significant judgment and is based

on assumptions which are subject to uncertainty on the estimation process due to the current economic

conditions which have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, specifically discount and growth

rates revenue assumptions and material price inflation

Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment

of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements.  The results of our audit

procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our

audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Impairment Testing of Goodwill

Under PFRSs, the Group is required to annually test the amount of goodwill for impairment.  As of

December 31, 2020, the goodwill attributable to several cash-generating units (CGUs) amounted to

P=55.2 billion or 9% of total assets, which is considered significant to the consolidated financial

statements.  In addition, management’s assessment process requires significant judgment and is based

on assumptions which are subject to uncertainty on the estimation process due to the current economic

conditions which have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, specifically discount and growth

rates, revenue assumptions, and material price inflation.

The Group’s disclosures about goodwill are included in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.

Audit Response

We involved our internal specialist in assessing the methodologies and assumptions used.  These

assumptions include discount and growth rates, revenue assumptions, and material price inflation.  We

compared the key assumptions used, such as growth rate and revenue assumptions against the

historical performance of the CGUs, industry outlook and other relevant external data, taking into

consideration the impact associated with the coronavirus pandemic.  We tested the parameters used in

the determination of the discount rates against market data.  We also reviewed the Group’s disclosures

about those assumptions to which the outcome of the impairment test is most sensitive; specifically

those that have the most significant effect on the determination of the recoverable amount of goodwill.

Revenue Recognition of Distribution Utilities

The distribution utilities’ revenue from the sale of electricity amounting to P=41.8 billion accounts for

22% of the Group’s consolidated revenues and is material to the Group.  This matter is significant to the

audit because the revenue recognized depends on the electric consumption captured, the rates applied

across different customers, and the systems involved in the billing process.  Electric consumption

captured is based on the meter readings taken on various dates for the different types of customers

(i.e., industrial, commercial, and residential customers) within the franchise areas of operations of the

distribution utilities.

The Group’s disclosures related to this matter are provided in Notes 2 and 26 to the consolidated

financial statements.

A member firm of Ernst &amp; Young Global Limited

- 3 -

Audit Response

We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design and tested the controls over the billing and

revenue process which includes the capture and accumulation of meter data in the billing system and

calculation of billed amounts, and uploading of billed amounts from the billing system to the financial

reporting system.  We performed a test calculation of the rates using the Energy Regulatory

Commission-approved rates and formulae, then compared them with the rates used in billing

statements.

Recoverability of Certain Segments of Property, Plant and Equipment

Based on the assessment of the Group as of December 31, 2020, certain segments of its property, plant

and equipment totaling P=41.6 billion, may be impaired due to the existence of impairment indicators.

As such, the Group assessed the recoverable amount of these segments of property and equipment and

this requires significant judgment and involves estimation and assumptions about future electricity

generation levels and costs as well as external inputs such as fuel prices, electricity prices and discount

rates.  In addition, because of the coronavirus pandemic, there is heightened level of uncertainty on the

future economic outlook and market forecast.  Hence, we consider such assessment as a key audit

matter in our audit.

The disclosures about the recoverability of certain segments of property, plant and equipment are

included in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

prices, electricity prices and discount rates.  We compared the key assumptions used against the

historical performance of certain segments of property, plant and equipment, industry outlook and

data.  We also reviewed the Group’s disclosures about those assumptions to which the outcome of the

impairment test is most sensitive; specifically those that have the most significant effect on the

determination of the recoverable amounts of certain segments of property, plant and equipment.

Accounting for Investment in an Associate

The Group has an investment in Union Bank of the Philippines (UBP), which is a universal bank that is

publicly listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange and accounted for under the equity method.  For the

year ended December 31, 2020, the Group’s share in the net income of UBP amounted to P=5.9 billion

and accounts for 28% of the Group’s consolidated net income.  The Group’s share in UBP’s net income is

significantly affected by the level of provisioning of its loans and receivables applying the expected

credit loss (ECL) model.  This matter is significant to our audit because the application of the ECL model

requires significant management judgment and estimates.

The Group’s disclosures on investments in associates are in Notes 2 and 10 to the consolidated financial

statements.

A member firm of Ernst &amp; Young Global Limited

- 4 -

Audit Response

We obtained the financial information of UBP for the year ended December 31, 2020 and

recomputed the Group’s share in net income of UBP and assessed the disclosures of the investment in

associate in the consolidated financial statements.

We obtained an understanding of the methodologies and models used for UBP’s different credit

exposures and assessed whether these considered the requirements of PFRS 9, Financial Instruments, to

reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted outcome, and to consider the time value of money and the

best available forward-looking information.  We also inspected and considered the results of the model

validation on the risk rating performed by management’s specialist.

We (a) assessed UBP’s segmentation of its credit risk exposures based on homogeneity of credit risk

characteristics; (b) tested the definition of default and significant increase in credit risk criteria against

historical analysis of accounts, credit risk management policies and practices in place, and

management’s assessment of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the counterparties;  (c) tested

UBP’s application of internal credit risk rating system, including the impact of the coronavirus pandemic

on the borrowers, by reviewing the ratings of sample credit exposures; (d) tested loss given default by

inspecting historical recoveries and related costs, write-offs and collateral valuations, and the effects of

credit enhancements provided by any party; (e) tested exposure at default considering outstanding

commitments and repayment scheme; (f) checked the forward-looking information used for overlay

through statistical test and corroboration using publicly available information and our understanding of

UBP’s lending portfolios and broader industry knowledge, including the impact of the coronavirus

pandemic; and (g) tested the effective interest rate used in discounting the ECL.

Further, we checked the data used in the ECL models by reconciling data from source system reports to

the data warehouse and from the data warehouse to the loss allowance analysis/models and financial

reporting systems.  To the extent that the loss allowance analysis is based on credit exposures that have

been disaggregated into subsets of debt financial assets with similar risk characteristics, we traced or re-

performed the disaggregation from source systems to the loss allowance analysis.  We also assessed the

assumptions used where there are missing or insufficient data.

We recalculated impairment provisions on a sample basis.  We involved our internal specialists in the

performance of the above procedures.

Consolidation Process

Aboitiz Equity Ventures, Inc. owns a significant number of domestic and foreign entities at varying equity

interests.  We considered the consolidation process as a key audit matter because it required significant

auditor attention, particularly on the following areas: (a) fair value adjustments arising from business

combinations, (b) numerous intercompany transactions, (c) alignment of accounting policies of the

investees with the Group’s policy on property, plant and equipment and investment properties, (d)

translation of investees’ foreign-currency-denominated financial information to the Group’s functional

currency and (e) other equity adjustments.

The Group’s disclosures on the basis of consolidation are in Note 2 to the consolidated financial

statements.

Audit Response

We obtained an understanding of the Group’s consolidation process and the related controls, the

process for identifying related parties and related party transactions, as well as the reconciliation of

intercompany balances.  We also checked the entities included in the consolidation and reviewed the

eliminating entries recorded, including fair value adjustments.  In addition, we reviewed the foreign

currency translation adjustments, as well as the alignment of accounting policies on property, plant and

equipment and investment properties.

Other Information

Management is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises the information

included in the SEC Form 20-IS (Definitive Information Statement), SEC Form 17-A and Annual Report for

the year ended December 31, 2020, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our

auditor’s report thereon.  The SEC Form 20-IS (Definitive Information Statement), SEC Form 17-A and

Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2020 are expected to be made available to us after the

date of this auditor’s report.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we will

not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the

other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the

other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge

obtained in the audits, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial

Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial

statements in accordance with PFRSs, and for such internal control as management determines is

necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s

ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and

using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or

to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements

as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s

report that includes our opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a

A member firm of Ernst &amp; Young Global Limited

guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with PSAs will always detect a material misstatement

when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually

or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users

taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with PSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain

professional skepticism throughout the audit.  We also:



Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,

whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and

obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.  The risk

of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from

error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the

override of internal control.



Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures

that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the

effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.



Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting

estimates and related disclosures made by management.



Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting

and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events

or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s

report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are

inadequate, to modify our opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to

the date of our auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to

cease to continue as a going concern.



Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,

including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the

underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.



Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or

We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit.  We remain solely

responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned

scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in

internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant

ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and

other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable,

related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that

were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and

are therefore the key audit matters.  We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or

regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we

determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences

of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such

communication.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Aboitiz Power Corporation

Opinion

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Aboitiz Power Corporation and its

subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as at December 31, 2020 and

2019, and the consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of comprehensive income,

consolidated statements of changes in equity and consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the

three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and notes to the consolidated financial

statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material

respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and its

consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the

period ended December 31, 2020 in accordance with Philippine Financial Reporting Standards (PFRSs).

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audits in accordance with Philippine Standards on Auditing (PSAs).  Our

responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the

Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.  We are independent of the

Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants in the Philippines (Code of

Ethics) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated

financial statements in the Philippines, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in

accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics.  We believe that the audit evidence we

have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in

our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period.  These matters were

addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in

forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.  For each

matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

- 2 -

We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the

Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters.

Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment

of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements.  The results of our audit

procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for

our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Impairment Testing of Goodwill

Under PFRSs, the Group is required to annually test the amount of goodwill for impairment.  As of

December 31, 2020, the goodwill attributable to several cash-generating units (CGUs) amounted to

P38.81 billion or 10% of total assets, which is considered significant to the consolidated financial

statements.  In addition, management’s assessment process requires significant judgment and is based

on assumptions which are subject to uncertainty on the estimation process due to the current

economic conditions which have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, specifically discount and

growth rates, revenue assumptions, and material price inflation.

The Group’s disclosures about goodwill are included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial

Independent Auditors’ Report

Aboitiz Power Corporation


Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc.

Annual and Sustainability Report 2020

242

243

*SGVFSM005180*

procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for

our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Impairment Testing of Goodwill

Under PFRSs, the Group is required to annually test the amount of goodwill for impairment.  As of

December 31, 2020, the goodwill attributable to several cash-generating units (CGUs) amounted to

P38.81 billion or 10% of total assets, which is considered significant to the consolidated financial

statements.  In addition, management’s assessment process requires significant judgment and is based

on assumptions which are subject to uncertainty on the estimation process due to the current

economic conditions which have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, specifically discount and

growth rates, revenue assumptions, and material price inflation.

The Group’s disclosures about goodwill are included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial

statements.

Audit Response

We involved our internal specialist in assessing the methodologies and assumptions used.  These

assumptions include discount and growth rates, revenue assumptions, and material price inflation.  We

compared the key assumptions used, such as growth rate and revenue assumptions against the

historical performance of the CGUs, industry outlook and other relevant external data, taking into

consideration the impact associated with the coronavirus pandemic.  We tested the parameters used in

the determination of the discount rates against market data.  We also reviewed the Group’s disclosures

about those assumptions to which the outcome of the impairment test is most sensitive; specifically,

those that have the most significant effect on the determination of the recoverable amount of

goodwill.

Revenue Recognition of Distribution Utilities

The distribution utilities’ revenue from the sale of electricity amounting to P41.87 billion accounts for

38% of the Group’s consolidated revenues and is material to the Group.  This matter is significant to the

audit because the revenue recognized depends on the electric consumption captured, the rates applied

across different customers, and the systems involved in the billing process.  Electric consumption

captured is based on the meter readings taken on various dates for the different types of customers

(i.e., industrial, commercial, and residential customers) within the franchise areas of operations of the

distribution utilities.

The Group’s disclosures related to this matter are provided in Notes 3 and 20 to the consolidated financial

statements.

Audit Response

We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design and tested the controls over the billing and

revenue process which includes the capture and accumulation of meter data in the billing system and

calculation of billed amounts, and uploading of billed amounts from the billing system to the financial

- 3 -

reporting system.  We performed a test calculation of the rates using the Energy Regulatory

Commission-approved rates and formulae, then compared them with the rates used in billing

statements.

Recoverability of Certain Segments of Property, Plant and Equipment

Based on the assessment of the Group as of December 31, 2020, certain segments of its property, plant

and equipment totaling P41.6 billion, may be impaired due to the existence of impairment indicators.

As such, the Group assessed the recoverable amount of these segments of property and equipment

and this requires significant judgment and involves estimation and assumptions about future electricity

generation levels and costs as well as external inputs such as fuel prices, electricity prices and discount

rates.  In addition, because of the coronavirus pandemic, there is heightened level of uncertainty on

the future economic outlook and market forecast.  Hence, we consider such assessment as a key audit

matter in our audit.

The disclosures about the recoverability of certain segments of property, plant and equipment are

included in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.

Audit Response

We involved our internal specialist in assessing the methodologies and assumptions used.  These

assumptions include future electricity generation levels and costs, as well as external inputs such as

fuel prices, electricity prices and discount rates. We compared the key assumptions used against the

*SGVFSM005180*

generation levels and costs as well as external inputs such as fuel prices, electricity prices and discount

rates.  In addition, because of the coronavirus pandemic, there is heightened level of uncertainty on

the future economic outlook and market forecast.  Hence, we consider such assessment as a key audit

matter in our audit.

The disclosures about the recoverability of certain segments of property, plant and equipment are

included in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.

Audit Response

We involved our internal specialist in assessing the methodologies and assumptions used.  These

assumptions include future electricity generation levels and costs, as well as external inputs such as

fuel prices, electricity prices and discount rates.  We compared the key assumptions used against the

historical performance of certain segments of property, plant and equipment, industry outlook and

other relevant external data, taking into consideration the impact associated with the coronavirus

pandemic.  We tested the parameters used in the determination of the discount rate against market

data.  We also reviewed the Group’s disclosures about those assumptions to which the outcome of the

impairment test is most sensitive; specifically those that have the most significant effect on the

determination of the recoverable amounts of certain segments of property, plant and equipment.

Consolidation Process

Aboitiz Power Corporation owns a significant number of domestic and foreign entities at varying equity

interests.  We considered the consolidation process as a key audit matter because it required

significant auditor attention, particularly on the following areas: (a) fair value adjustments arising from

business combinations, (b) numerous intercompany transactions, (c) alignment of accounting policies

of the investees with the Group’s policy on property, plant and equipment and investment properties,

(d) translation of investees’ foreign-currency-denominated financial information to the Group’s

functional currency and (e) other equity adjustments.

The Group’s disclosures on the basis of consolidation are in Note 3 to the consolidated financial

statements.

Audit Response

We obtained an understanding of the Group’s consolidation process and the related controls, the

process for identifying related parties and related party transactions, as well as the reconciliation of

intercompany balances.  We also checked the entities included in the consolidation and reviewed the

- 4 -

eliminating entries recorded, including fair value adjustments.  In addition, we reviewed the foreign

currency translation adjustments, as well as the alignment of accounting policies on property, plant and

equipment and investment properties.

Other Information

Management is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises the

information included in the SEC Form 20-IS (Definitive Information Statement), SEC Form 17-A and

Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2020 but does not include the consolidated financial

statements and our auditor’s report thereon.  The SEC Form 20-IS (Definitive Information Statement),

SEC Form 17-A and Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2020 are expected to be made

available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we will

not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the

other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the

other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our

knowledge obtained in the audits, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial

Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial

statements in accordance with PFRSs, and for such internal control as management determines is

necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to

liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial

statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue

an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is

not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with PSAs will always detect a material

misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material

if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic

decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

- 5 -

As part of an audit in accordance with PSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain

professional skepticism throughout the audit.  We also:



Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,

whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and

obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.  The risk

of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from

error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the

override of internal control.



Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit

procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an

opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.



Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting

estimates and related disclosures made by management.



Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting

and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events

or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s

report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are

inadequate, to modify our opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up

to the date of our auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to

cease to continue as a going concern.



Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,

including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the

underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.



Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or

business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements

*SGVFSM005180*

and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events

or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s

report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are

inadequate, to modify our opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up

to the date of our auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to

cease to continue as a going concern.



Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,

including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the

underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.



Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or

business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit.  We remain solely

responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned

scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in

internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant

ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and

other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable,

related safeguards.



- 6 -

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters

that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current

period and are therefore the key audit matters.  We describe these matters in our auditor’s report

unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare

circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the

adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest

benefits of such communication.
