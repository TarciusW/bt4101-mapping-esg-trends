1.2 Message to stakeholders 

On behalf of our Board of Directors, it is my pleasure to present our Sustainability Report 

for the financial year ended 31 December 2018 (FY2018). 

FY2018 was a challenging yet fruitful year for the Group. In FY2017, reforms in the national medical and 

health system affected production circulation in the pharmaceutical industry as well as the Group’s products 

and production line. This prompted pharmaceutical companies to adjust their sales processes and promote 

sales of their products more actively.  

In response to this change in national policy, the Group reorganised its sales department and engaged with 

customers more closely during the year. As a result, the Group achieved higher sales across all drug 

segments to bring about strong revenue growth in the current year. These changes also built a strong 

foundation for our future. 

The Group made good progress in the production, sales as well as research and development (R&amp;D) of its 

products during the year. Acetylcysteine Solution for Inhalation was given production approval and obtained 

two exclusive specifications from the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), the national agency 

for regulating drugs and medical devices. Rocuronium Bromide Injection is currently being reviewed by 

Centre for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of NMPA and is expected to obtain approval in FY2019. When approved, it 

will expand the Group’s range of anaesthetic products and is expected to contribute positively to the Group’s 

revenue. The Group also started generic-drug-consistency evaluation for two products and commenced R&amp;D 

on several new products, of which two products under R&amp;D are expected to be submitted to NMPA in 2019 

for application. In addition, Vecuronim Bromide for Injection was conferred the Hainan High-tech Product 

certificate for its excellent quality. 

On the corporate social responsibility front, the Group partnered with Hainan Medical University, Hainan 

Technology and Business College as well as Hainan Institute of Science and Technology to offer internship 

programmes. Through these, the Group hired 28 capable fresh graduates as part of its continuous effort to 

recruit talent for business expansion. The Group also opened up more than 100 jobs to the citizens of 

Qionghai City in Hainan province. 

In the FY2018 sustainability report, we will be reporting on the Group’s sustainability efforts based on our 

four pillars of sustainable development, comprising Economic Contribution, Drug Quality and Safety, 

Environmental Sustainability, and Social Contribution. 

In addition, we wish to confirm that the Board has considered sustainability issues as part of its strategic 

formulation, determined the material environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and overseen the 

management and monitoring of the material ESG factors. 

As part of StarPharm’s commitment to sustainable development, we will continue to strive to do business in a 

responsible way. We will improve on our sustainability achievements and partner with other parties to create 

a green ecosphere as well as a natural and harmonious living environment.

1.3 Scope of sustainability report 

The scope of the report covers information on material sustainability aspects of StarPharm and its 

subsidiaries, from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 unless otherwise specified. This should sufficiently 

address stakeholders’ concerns in relation to sustainability issues arising from the major business operations 

of the Group. 

This report is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core Option as it 

provides a set of an extensive framework that is widely accepted as a global standard for sustainability 

reporting. It also considers the Sustainability Reporting Guide in Practice Note 7.6 of the Singapore 

Exchange Securities Trading Limited (SGX-ST) Listing Manual. In preparing our report, we applied the GRI’s 

principles for defining report content and report quality by considering the Group’s activities, impacts and 

substantive expectations and interests of its stakeholders.  

The data and information provided within the report have not been verified by an independent third party. We 

have relied on internal data monitoring and verification to ensure accuracy. 

1.4 Restatements 

Data below have been adjusted in the body of the FY2018 Sustainability Report. 

• 

Carbon emissions intensity and water consumption intensity for FY2017 was recomputed due to 

change in organisation-specific metric (denominator) from total revenue (in ¥’m) to total production 

manhours (in hours).  

The data collected for this report has been gathered using the robust systems and tools currently in place for 

the reporting year. Continuous improvement of our data collection and analysis processes is an ongoing focus 

for StarPharm.

3. Our performance 

3.1 How we measure our performance 

Our sustainability strategy is embedded into the appropriate parts of our business, with dedicated teams 

for each focus area, and coordination by our relevant departmental managers. 

Progress will be tracked in two key ways: measuring performance against metrics, and evaluating how well 

the programs have advanced, through a series of ‘commitments’. 

Metrics and targets 

We have established key performance indicators for each of the four focus areas outlined in our 

sustainability strategy. Periodically, we plan to introduce new metrics and update targets to ensure 

alignment with our strategy. 

Commitments 

To ensure we have a robust sustainability programme in place, we have included the key commitments for 

each area of our sustainability strategy. The progress we have made against each key commitment is 

indicated using the symbols shown in the table below. 

We track and review our sustainability programme with the Board of Directors at least once a year.

3.2 Economic contribution 

Overview 

As stated in our Company mission, we are dedicated to 

creating healthier lives through medical innovation. 

Backed by our intensive research and development 

(R&amp;D) efforts, our broad range of pharmaceutical 

products have benefitted countless patients throughout 

the years.  

Extensive distribution network 

We produce a broad range of pharmaceutical products, including 

antibiotics, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular drugs, available in 

different administration forms and dosages. This hence improves the 

usage convenience of our drugs by a wide range of patients. 

In FY2018, we achieved sales of ¥242 million through our established 

sales and distribution network consisting of approximately 1,391 

distributors. These distributors are supported by our 29 liaison offices 

located in major provinces and cities in the PRC, enabling us to 

distribute our products quickly and extensively to hospitals, clinics 

and pharmacies throughout the country. 

In FY2017, reforms in the national medical and health system 

affected production circulation in the pharmaceutical industry as well 

as the Group’s products and production line. This prompted 

pharmaceutical companies to adjust their sales processes and 

promote sales of their products more actively through increased 

distributorships. In response to this change in national policy, the 

Group reorganised its sales department and engaged with customers 

more closely during the year. The general increase in selling price of 

drugs, coupled with a higher sales quantity achieved during the year, 

resulted in greatly improved sales for the Group in FY2018. 

We will continue to track and monitor the sales network performance 

of the Group and report the progress every year.

Our intensive R&amp;D efforts are backed by an experienced in-house R&amp;D team, holding various academic 

qualifications in pharmacy, pharmaceutical engineering, medicine analysis and medical study. The R&amp;D 

team also occasionally collaborates with research institutes in the PRC. 

The PRC government also awards grants to small and medium pharmaceutical manufacturers in the PRC to 

fund the development of pharmaceutical products. Such government grants are only awarded to enterprises 

who fulfill certain criteria such as being involved in the development and manufacture of technologically 

advanced products, being of a good financial position, having a good financial management structure in 

place, as well as possessing a management team with strong market exploitation capabilities.

In FY2018, R&amp;D spending amounted to ¥18.7 million with ¥16.9 million spent on R&amp;D projects and ¥1.8 

million spent on R&amp;D expenses. In addition, we received grants amounting to ¥1.2 million for the R&amp;D of new 

products. We will continue to track and monitor the Group’s R&amp;D spending and R&amp;D grants received and 

report the progress every year. 

Currently, we hold 5 patents used in the production of our drugs and obtained production approvals for 100 

pharmaceutical products, of which we manufacture and sell 24 of them.  

In the current year, Acetylcysteine Solution for Inhalation was given production approval and obtained two 

exclusive specifications from the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), the national agency for 

regulating drugs and medical devices. Rocuronium Bromide Injection is currently being reviewed by Centre 

for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of NMPA and is expected to obtain approval in FY2019. When approved, it will 

expand the Group’s range of anaesthetic products and is expected to contribute positively to the Group’s 

revenue. The Group also started generic-drug-consistency evaluation for two products and commenced R&amp;D 

on several new products, of which two products under R&amp;D are expected to be submitted to NMPA in 

FY2019 for application. In addition, Vecuronim Bromide for Injection was conferred the Hainan High-tech 

Product certificate for its excellent quality.

3.3 Drug quality and safety 

Overview 

Drug quality and safety are core to our commercial 

reputation and consumers’ expectations. We are 

committed to responsible sourcing as it helps assure 

safety and quality of our end products.  

We have always stressed the importance of drug quality 

and safety in our operations in each stage of our 

production process as evidenced by the GMP 

certifications over our production facilities. 

GMP certification 

GMP is a set of standards in respect of quality management of 

pharmaceutical products and their manufacturing industry. It 

encompasses requirements on personnel, plant and equipment and 

various management systems of production organisation, such as 

production processes, hygiene standards and education level. These 

are applicable to the entire pharmaceutical production process and 

the key working procedures for the production of raw materials which 

affect the quality of finished medicine products. 

In August 1999, the State Food and Drug Administration of the PRC  

(国家食品药品监督管理局)(SFDA) implemented a GMP certification 

system in pharmaceutical manufacturing to enhance its regulation on 

pharmaceutical production enterprises. 

Since August 2002, all our production lines are fully compliant with 

the GMP requirements of the SFDA. We have implemented a quality 

assurance system and instituted quality control procedures 

throughout our entire manufacturing process in accordance with GMP 

requirements to ensure the quality of our products, including the 

safety and effectiveness of their use. We seek to continue to be fully 

compliant with GMP requirements of the SFDA. 

Quality supply chain 

We purchase entirely from reliable local suppliers. We believe that a 

secure and stable supply chain is very important to ensure the 

smooth and uninterrupted operation of our production activities.

We conduct checks on the quality of raw materials procured on a sampling basis. Only raw materials that 

meet our quality requirements will be used in the manufacture of our products. Raw materials which do not 

meet our quality requirements will be returned to the relevant supplier.In addition, our quality assurance team 

regularly visits our raw material suppliers to conduct on-site assessment of their quality assurance system to 

assess whether their quality assurance system meet our requirements. The assessment covers the 

operation of their quality assurance system and overall assessment of their manufacturing facilities in order 

to ensure that our suppliers have the capability to provide to us raw materials of the required quality. We will 

only procure raw materials from suppliers who meet our quality requirements.

Ensuring production quality 

Quality management in our production process is as follows. 

 

Pre-production 

Before commencing production, we conduct strict checks on the production area to ensure 

that the production environment is free from contamination and meets our strict cleanliness 

standards. This includes checks on dust particles in the air purifying system, temperature, 

humidity, bacteria, microorganisms on the surface of key work areas.  

In addition, we also conduct checks and inspection on water, compressed gas and steam 

used in the manufacture of our products and conduct regular inspections to ensure that our 

manufacturing equipment meet our strict cleanliness standards. 

All production staff are required to undergo training and all staff must observe strict hygiene 

standards within the production area so as to ensure that the production environment is 

free from contamination and meet our strict cleanliness standards. In addition, health 

checks are also conducted on all staff annually.  

 

Production 

During production, the various production processes are carried out according to the 

requirements stipulated for the product as well as specifications stated in the production 

orders.  

Production operators are required to strictly adhere to work operation procedures and 

equipment operation procedures. The production operators will monitor the entire 

production process and quality assurance inspectors will inspect the production equipment 

and process. Any abnormalities discovered will be rectified immediately and reported. 

 

Quality control inspection 

After production, the products are placed at the inspection area according to product name, 

specifications and batch number. Full inspections carried out on the various products are 

based on standards which meet state requirements. 

After the inspection, our quality assurance department will issue a report on the finished 

products and only products which pass our quality assurance inspections are sent to the 

warehouse. Products which fail our quality assurance inspections will be disposed off 

accordingly. 

 

Product delivery 

Our quality assurance inspectors will review checks on the use of materials, production 

process, production control, production records and inspection records. If no abnormalities 

are detected, the product approval slip is issued. The warehouse will release products upon 

receipt of both the finished product report and the products approval slip so as to ensure 

that the products are 100% qualified. 

 

GMP compliance 

In addition, we will carry out internal checks to ensure compliance with GMP requirements 

and the results of these checks are analysed and problems relating to product quality will 

be rectified. The results will be promptly submitted to the management so as to ensure 

effective operation of the quality assurance system. 

We also retain a sample of each batch of finished products for control purposes and for 

future testing. We regularly monitor these samples over the shelf life of the product for any 

deterioration in quality. 

As part of our strategy, we seek to continue our track record of zero drug safety incidents, serious incidents 

and workplace injuries in the coming year.

3.4 Environmental sustainability 

Overview 

Environmental protection is fast gaining traction in China 

amongst policy makers and the public. As one of the 

leading pharmaceutical manufacturers in China, we are 

committed to ensuring our full compliance with national 

environmental regulations.  

Comprehensive policies are developed to ensure our 

commitment towards environmental protection, reducing 

carbon emissions, preventing pollution, and minimising 

waste can be achieved during our daily operations.  

Environmental policy in China 

Environmental policy in China is set by the National People's 

Congress and managed by the Ministry of Environmental Protection 

of the People's Republic of China. The central government issues 

strict regulations for which the actual monitoring and enforcement is 

largely undertaken by the local governments. 

In January 2015, a new environmental law came into effect, covering 

land, water and air pollution. It contains strict penalties, including 

seizing of the property of illegal polluters, with company executives 

subject to prison sentences of 15 days. There is no upper limit on 

fines. More than 300 different groups will be able to sue on the behalf 

of people harmed by pollution. 

StarPharm is fully compliant with China’s environmental policy. As 

part of our strategy, we seek to continue to be fully compliant with 

China’s environmental policy with zero environmental incidents and 

zero fines on contravention of environmental regulations. 

Emissions reduction 

The corporate culture of protecting the environment is reflected in 

every operation undertaken by the Group. We are committed to 

positive action on climate change and dedicated to reducing the 

carbon emission in our daily operations. Employees are reminded to 

save electricity and fuel consumption through regular internal 

communications.  

To determine the carbon footprint, we collect energy usage data from 

each our businesses and then calculate our total annual greenhouse 

gas emissions.

We follow the Greenhouse Gas Protocol established by the World Resources Institute and the World 

Business Council for Sustainable Development, the standard manual for measuring corporate greenhouse 

gas emissions. Using the “control method”, we include 100% of the emissions associated with businesses 

which we directly control. Our carbon footprint includes:  

• 

All fuels used directly by our companies (Scope 1 emissions) 

• 

All purchased electricity used in our facilities (Scope 2 emissions) 

• 

Impact of business travel, and transportation of goods to our customers (optional Scope 3 

emissions) 


Sustainability Report for the year ended 31 December 2018 

STAR Pharmaceutical Limited | 15 

 

 

 

 

 



In FY2018, the Group generated a total 

carbon footprint of 5,838 tonnes of 

carbon dioxide emission (tCO2e), with a 

carbon emission intensity of 34.7 tCO2e 

per thousand production manhours, 

representing a 19% decrease from the 

previous year. The emission mainly 

arises from direct fuel used in the 

production process (i.e. diesel for 

generators) and transportation (i.e. 

petrol for vehicles), which accounted for 

almost 67% of the total carbon emission 

of the Group. 

The decrease in carbon footprint 

intensity is mainly due to more efficient 

utilisation of diesel in the production 

process. The decrease is offset by a 

slight increase in carbon footprint from 

increased trips made to our distributors 

to promote sales of our products, 

subsequent to the reorganisation of our 

sales department. 

We recognise that reducing carbon emissions in our daily operations has a positive effect on climate change. 

As such, StarPharm has committed to reducing our carbon footprint per production manhour by 3% by 

FY2025, from a FY2018 baseline. 

Energy efficiency 

Due to our manufacturing activities, direct fuel and electricity constitutes a significant proportion of our 

operating expenses. By investing in energy efficiency, we not only help protect the environment but can also 

lower our financial costs. 

To ensure the effective use of fuel and electricity, the Group conducted the following practices: 

• 

Using energy-saving vehicles and equipment  

• 

Regular maintenance of production equipment, especially boilers, to maintain high energy efficiency 

• 

Using high quality diesel to ensure high energy efficiency 

• 

Turning off lights, computers and air conditioning system before clocking out 

• 

Placing energy-saving reminder labels next to switches 

Wastewater and hazardous waste management 

Wastewater is passed through an in-house wastewater treatment facility fitted with biological treatment 

tanks. As a result, the treated wastewater discharge will be able to meet the requirements of the water 

emission standard of Qionghai City. In addition, the municipal environmental protection bureau obtains 

wastewater samples from the facility at least four times a year to ensure that discharge standards are met. 

As part of our strategy, we seek to continue to ensure that 100% of our wastewater discharge meet the local 

emission standards. 

Hazardous waste from the production of our drugs is aggregated in a locked and isolated container and 

disposed through proper biohazard disposal channels.  

In FY2018, the Group discharged 0.6m3 of wastewater and disposed 0.5t of hazardous waste. Wastewater 

discharged and hazardous waste disposed was significantly higher in the previous year due to runoffs from 

major maintenance and cleaning of our production equipment. Major maintenance and cleaning was not 

conducted in the current year.

Saving water 

Water scarcity is a growing concern around the world and a serious global challenge that we must work 

together to address. This is even a greater concern to us, given that water is also an essential input in the 

food industry, from cleaning and sanitation to manufacturing.  

In FY2018, the Group had a total water consumption of 105.2m3, with a water consumption intensity of 

0.6 m3 per thousand production manhours, Water consumption intensity was higher in the previous year due 

to water used for major maintenance and cleaning of our production equipment. Major maintenance and 

cleaning was not conducted in the current year. 

Where possible, the Group already has procedures in place to reduce water usage in our production lines. 

Our employees are also reminded of the importance to save water in their daily activities. 

We will continue to track and monitor our performance on wastewater discharge, hazardous waste disposal, 

and water consumption. Progress and performance improvement will be reported every year.

3.5 Social contribution 

Overview 

Employees are the integral part of our competitive 

advantage and our sustainability agenda. We strive to 

invest in training and create an enjoyable working 

environment to our employees. Our human resources 

team develops, evolves and champions our human 

‘capital’ through training, evaluation, remuneration, and 

engagement.  

Through our people, we are also committed in making 

positive contributions to our community by giving back to 

the society and helping the less privileged. 

Skills competency and employee training 

To ensure that our employee excel, we emphasise on continuous 

learning in the workplace. Every employee has equal opportunities to 

upgrade and sharpen their skill sets through formal and on-the-job 

internal training programs. 

The Company also emphasises on internal leadership development, 

and places great importance on developing a network of new-

generation leaders who would play an important role in driving the 

business in the future. 

In FY2018, the Group held a total of 79 training sessions, 

representing a 68% increase from the previous year. The increase is 

due to increased efforts in internal training by the Company to ensure 

employee’s skill competency. Training topics range from GMP and 

quality control, to fire safety and government regulations.  

As part of our strategy, StarPharm has committed to conducting a 

minimum of 50 sessions of training per year on an ongoing basis.

Performance appraisal 

To ensure the Company achieves its goals, we have various performance appraisal methods in place to 

determine the performance of the Company as well as each individual employee.  

The employee performance appraisal comprises mainly quantifiable evaluation criteria. In addition, we 

actively collects performance information for each employee each month through inputs from direct 

supervisors and feedbacks, as well as periodical employee communication sessions.  

These collected information allow us to understand the performance and skills development needs of each 

team and individual employee from multiple aspects. This is crucial for the Company to develop annual 

training programs for employees that are designed to enhance their skills and improve overall productivity.  

In FY2018, all of our employees are at least subject to an annual performance appraisal by their superiors. 

We seek to continue this practice in the coming year. 

Equal opportunity 

We have always been an equal opportunity employer to provide a fair workplace for employees, following the 

principles of equality and non-discrimination. Recruitment, remuneration, promotion, and benefits are 

required to be handled based on objective assessment, equal opportunity and non-discrimination regardless 

of gender, race, marital status, pregnancy, disability, age or family status. 

We attract talent through fair, and flexible recruitment strategy that includes recruitment application, job 

description, job applications, interview, selection, approval, and job offer. Promotion is based on performance 

and suitability.

We offer competitive remuneration to attract and retain talented staff members. Remuneration packages 

(which includes the necessary social benefits) are reviewed periodically to ensure consistency with 

employment market. Dismissal also complies with employment laws and regulations relating to non-

discrimination. 

In FY2018, female employees comprise 62% of our entire workforce, with female representation in 

management at 31%. We will continue to track and monitor female representation in our workforce and 

report these statistics every year. 

Encouraging work-life balance 

To enhance employee teamwork and cohesion, improve employee health and improve employee work-life 

balance, the Group has been organising periodic employee gatherings during major festivals and sports 

competitions. This helps the employees relax their mind and body, develop teamwork, explore their talent, so 

as to develop a positive attitude in both work and life. 

Community initiatives 

In FY2018, our Group made cash donations totaling ¥4,000 to various village committee and alumni 

associations to fund their cultural engagement activities. The Group will continue to invest in the above and 

other initiatives supporting community building. 

We will continue to track and monitor our performance on community initiatives and report these statistics
