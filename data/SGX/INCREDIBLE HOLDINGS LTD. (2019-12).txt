Board Statement 

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Incredible Holdings Ltd. (the “Company”) and 

its subsidiaries (the “Group”) is pleased to present our annual sustainability report for 

the year ended 31 December 2019 (“FY2019”). 

 

Sustainability reporting has become a key component for listed companies to promote 

transparency on their sustainable business practices in relation to the economic, 

environmental, social and governance (“EESG”) topics.  The Board will continue to 

monitor and review the EESG topics taking into consideration of any changes in the 

business environment and stakeholders’ feedback. 

 

The Board believes that building a sustainable business is vital to our continued 

development as a successful business and that we must be fully accountable for our 

impact on the environment, our customers, our people, and our community as well as 

our financial performance. The Board is committed to practice principles laid out on 

the Corporate Sustainability Policy and ensure that sustainable business practices are 

incorporated into every link of our value chain to satisfy our responsibility to society. 

 

For FY2019, the new business of trading and retailing of luxury watches has started 

gaining ground and became one of the main sources of revenue for the Group. The 

Group continued to divest its investment in Indonesia by disposing the remaining 49% 

equities interest in PT Louis Gianni and disposing 100% equities interest of a 

Singapore wholly-owned subsidiary to exit the switchgear design and assembly 

business. The disposal of equities interest in both companies are still in progress and 

have not been completed as at the date of this report. Please refer to the respective 

announcements on the SGX website dated 23 December 2019 and 9 January 2020 

for more information. The Company had embarked on fundraising exercises to raise 

the necessary fund for the new business of providing for personal and business loans 

in Hong Kong and potential acquisition of a new business. 

 

In pursuing business diversification and growth, we remain committed to the 

conservation of the environment and the development of our people. We remain 

vigilant in the conduct of our businesses and continue to actively engage our 

stakeholders to address their concerns and needs. The success of our sustainability 

journey requires continuous efforts and support from our stakeholders. We are 

confident that together, we can formulate strategies to build a sustainable business 

model.

About the Sustainability Report 

This sustainability report presents the annual sustainability performance of the Group 

for the period 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. The information in this report is 

organised and presented in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option published 

in 2016, established by the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”). 

We would like to present our management approach to manage the economic, 

environmental, social and governance (“EESG”) related issues that are considered 

important and material to the Group. Through this sustainability report, we hope that 

various stakeholders such as shareholders, suppliers, customers and employees 

would be able to understand our sustainability strategies and commitment.  

The EESG topics selected in the FY2018 report have been re-evaluated for its 

materiality to the Group in FY2019. The Board is of the view that for FY2019, the 

material topics continued to be the same as those in FY2018. 

This report provides an update of the performance and targets on sustainability as set 

out in the previous report in FY2018 dated 28 May 2019. This report is also prepared 

in accordance with Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing 

Rules 711A and 711B and the relevant SGX Practice Notes on Sustainability Reporting 

Guide. Our data is reported in good faith and to the best of our knowledge.  Currently, 

there is no external assurance for this report.  

About the Company 

The Company is a public listed company headquartered in Singapore and together 

with its subsidiaries operates businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong. The Company 

is listed on the Catalist Board of the SGX-ST. The Group achieved S$8.8 million 

revenue for FY2019 and is in a net equity position of S$3.9 million as at 31 December 

2019.    

The Group’s core business is the distribution of equipment and consumable materials, 

such as Dry Film Photoresist (“Dry Film”) for the electronics industry. The Group also 

distributes consumable materials and spare parts to the manufacturer of etched lead 

frames, die attach, wire bonding machinery and automated encapsulation system for 

the semiconductor assembly industry. Our customers are mainly multinational 

companies. 

Some of the equipment and consumable materials are purchased and imported from 

overseas. For example, Dry Film is imported from South Korea for distribution. All our 

products are stored in a warehouse before being delivered to customers.   

The Group has embarked on a new business, which is the trading and retailing of 

luxury watches in Hong Kong from March 2018. Whilst Hong Kong would be the main 

market for the trading of luxury watches, the Group does not rule out the possibility of 

operating the new business in other geographical areas as it deems fit. Our customers 

are mainly walk-in customers, independent dealers and traders of luxury watches.

Feedback from key stakeholders form a crucial part of our strategic and business 

planning and are viewed as valuable insights for the Group to continuously improve its 

sustainability performance. The material topics were evaluated in FY2019 for its 

potential impact on the environment and society, its influence on the stakeholders and 

impact on the Group’s operations and all topics were deemed to be material to the 

Group. As such, the Steering Committee recommended to the Board the same topics 

to be the material topics to be reported in FY2019 

The Sustainability Committee aims to conduct an annual review of the Group’s material 

topics as well as monitor the performance of the topics as part of the Group’s 

sustainability strategy. 

The following EESG topics have been identified and the approaches of managing 

these topics are stated in this report: 

 

Whistle Blowing and Anti-Corruption (GRI 205-3) 

The Group strives to conduct business with the highest standards of integrity, 

transparency and accountability and does not tolerate bribery or corruption, and acts 

with fairness and integrity in its businesses. As such, this topic is deemed to be material 

to the Group. The Group is of the view that its whistle blowing policy is an important 

tool for the Group to achieve this objective.   

The Group has set up its whistle blowing policy and disseminated it to all employees 

through email and verbal communication.  By adopting the whistle blowing policy and 

for purpose of good governance, it is the policy of the Group that employees may, in 

confidence, raise concerns about possible corporate improprieties in matters of 

financial reporting or other matters without fear of retaliation. 

The main scope of the Group’s whistle blowing policy covers the following: 

1. Fraudulent financial reporting; 

2. Misstatements arising from misappropriation of assets; 

3. Improper or unauthorized expenditures (including bribery and other improper 

payment schemes);

4. Violations of laws and regulations (including those that expose the Group or its 

agents to regulatory or criminal actions, such as securities fraud); and 

5. Substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. 

 

The contact person of the whistle blowing policy is Mr. Stanley Leung Yu Tung, the 

Audit 

Committee 

Chairman 

of 

the 

Group 

who 

can 

be 

reached 

at 

stanleyleung.cpa@gmail.com. He will protect the identity of the complainant and 

investigate the matters with the Audit Committee. A record of the complaint will be kept 

confidentially to investigate. The Board will evaluate the effectiveness and 

management feedback of the policy annually. 

For FY2019, the Group has met the target set in FY2018 and there were no incidents 

of corruption and the Group has a target of zero incidents perpetually. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Waste Management (GRI 306-2) 

The Group is operating the business of trading and selling Dry Film Photoresist (“Dry 

Film”). Dry Film is considered a mild environmentally hazardous material and is 

subjected to compliance of the environmental protection regulation for disposal of such 

materials.  In order to protect the environment, we are committed to dispose damaged 

Dry Film properly. As such, this topic is deemed to be material to the Group. 

The Group has established a policy of handling damaged Dry Film. Dry Film is 

imported from an overseas supplier and resold to local etched lead frame 

manufacturers. Dry Film could be damaged during transportation from overseas to our 

cool room or due to defects in the manufacturing process. The damaged Dry Film 

needs to be properly disposed as it contains environmentally hazardous substances 

such as photopolymers resins.   

We are committed to comply with the Environmental Protection and Management Act, 

under Part VII: Hazardous Substances Control.  All damaged or rejected Dry Film are 

properly kept in the original boxes, sealed with scotch tape and disposed according to 

the guidelines. Before disposal, the damaged Dry Films are kept securely and 

separately in the Group’s premise to prevent theft. 

A list of rejected Dry Film is sent to the supplier for advice and approval for disposal.  

We have engaged a local licensed waste management agency to dispose the 

damaged Dry Film at incineration plants. The following table shows the total weight of 

the Dry Film bought by the Company, damaged Dry Film and the damaged Dry Film 

disposed for incineration from FY2017 to FY2019:

We have continuously disposed 100% of the damaged Dry Film in the past 3 years in 

order to protect our environment. For FY2019, the Group has met the target set in 

FY2018 to dispose 100% of damaged Dry Film through the local licensed waste 

management agency by sending them to the incineration plants and will strive to 

achieve this target for FY2020. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Product Information and Labeling (GRI 417-1) 

Transparency is the key factor to build trust and credibility along with our customers. It 

is our role and responsibility to share with our customers’ adequate information about 

the positive and negative environmental and social impacts of our products. As such, 

this topic is deemed to be material to the Group. 

All the Dry Film sold to customers have detailed labeling and information tag. Our Store 

Executive places all the Dry Film in boxes and seals them with scotch tape.  Product 

label is tagged on every box that is going to be delivered to our customers.   

We share the detailed information with our customers through the product label tagged 

on the Dry Film boxes and issuing the Material Safety Data Sheet (“MSDS”) which 

states the information above, such as the potential health effect of using such product, 

the safe use and proper approach in disposing the Dry Film. The MSDS is prepared 

by our supplier and we will ensure that the MSDS is made available for every purchase 

made by our customers. 

The following key information described in the product label are as follows:
