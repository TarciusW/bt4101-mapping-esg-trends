DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

 

COVID-19 caused significant human 

suffering and disruption. It also highlighted 

the interconnectedness of the global 

eco-system and our vulnerability to 

trans-border risks, whether from pandemics, 

environmental degradation or climate 

change, and the importance of sustainable 

development and building resilience.

In May 2020, Keppel unveiled Vision 2030, our 

long-term roadmap to grow and transform 

the Company from a conglomerate of diverse 

parts into an integrated business providing 

solutions for sustainable urbanisation, with 

sustainability at the core of our strategy. 

Beyond articulating the Company’s strategy, 

it also reflected our determination to focus 

on long-term growth and sustainability, even 

as we worked hard to combat the pandemic.

We are committed to sustainable development, 

and leverage collaboration and partnership to 

support the achievement of the United Nations 

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

We have incorporated 10 of the SDGs 

as a supporting framework to guide our 

sustainability strategy.

CLIMATE ACTION 

At the United Nations Climate Ambition 

Summit in December 2020, 75 global leaders 

presented ambitious new commitments to 

confront the climate crisis, demonstrating 

the impact of the Paris Agreement in 

accelerating climate action and ambition. 

Earlier on, in March 2020, the Singapore 

government had submitted its enhanced 

Nationally Determined Contribution and 

Long-Term Low-Emissions Development 

Strategy, with an absolute emissions target 

to peak emissions at 65 million tonnes 

of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) 

around 2030, halve emissions from its 

peak to 33MtCO2e by 2050, with a view to 

achieving net zero emissions as soon as 

viable in the second half of the century. 

More recently, the Singapore government 

has launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030 

in March 2021, a whole-of-nation movement 

to advance Singapore’s national agenda 

on sustainable development. 

Keppel is committed do its part to support 

the international agenda on climate action 

and also contribute towards Singapore’s 

Green Plan 2030.

Our stance on environmental sustainability is 

articulated in our Environmental Sustainability 

Policy, which is available on Keppel’s 

website. We are committed to improving 

our environmental performance, and have 

integrated environmental sustainability 

considerations into our major business 

and investment decisions, as well as 

the performance appraisal of senior 

management across the Group. 

In 2014, we set ourselves a target to reduce 

carbon emissions intensity by 16% from 

2020 business-as-usual levels. In 2018, 

we set a longer-term target to achieve a 

28.8% reduction in carbon emissions intensity 

from 2010 levels by 2030. Both targets 

are aligned with national goals set by 

the Singapore government over the years. 

I am pleased to announce that as at 

end-2020, we have achieved and surpassed 

our 2020 target, with a 29.4% average 

reduction in carbon emissions intensity 

from our 2010 baseline. Given the progress 

we have achieved, we are looking into how 

Keppel can further enhance its carbon 

emissions reduction target, including 

setting an absolute emissions reduction 

target aligned with climate science and 

Singapore’s national targets.

Reflecting our commitment to reduce 

our carbon footprint, Keppel’s corporate 

headquarters in Singapore has been 

powered by renewable energy since 

end-2018. This year, we have also acquired 

carbon credits to offset emissions from 

business travel and employee commuting, 

allowing our corporate office to achieve 

carbon neutrality for the whole of 2020.

BUILDING A 

SUSTAINABLE 

FUTURE

As part of Vision 2030, Keppel has  

put sustainability at the core of our strategy,  

and we are committed to supporting the  

UN Sustainable Development Goals.



LOH CHIN HUA Chief Executive Officer

Given the progress we have achieved in reducing  

carbon emissions intensity, we are looking into setting  

an absolute emissions reduction target aligned with  

climate science and Singapore’s national targets.

GROUP OVERVIEW

LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS

GRI 102-14


Beyond running our business in a sustainable 

manner, we are making sustainability our 

business through the solutions we provide.

The Group is estimated to have saved 

1,040,420 GJ of energy from its energy 

efficiency initiatives in 2020 and through 

cumulative green initiatives implemented 

at Keppel Land’s Green Mark-certified 

developments. The total energy saving is 

equivalent to about 54% of the Group’s total 

energy consumption in 2020, and translates 

to estimated cost savings of $68 million 

and avoidance of around 120,000 tCO2e. 

MAKING SUSTAINABILITY 

OUR BUSINESS

Beyond running our business in an 

environmentally responsible manner, 

we see sustainability as a business and 

envisage Keppel playing a significant role 

in helping businesses and communities 

around the world become more sustainable 

through the solutions that we provide. 

In line with Vision 2030, we have been 

progressively refocusing the Group’s 

portfolio on more sustainable solutions 

that contribute to a cleaner and 

greener world.

Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine (Keppel O&amp;M), 

traditionally known for being a global leader 

in building offshore drilling rigs, has been 

pivoting towards renewables and cleaner 

fossil fuels such as liquefied natural gas, 

which together made up more than 80% of 

its $3.3 billion orderbook as at end-2020. 

Earlier this year, we announced that 

Keppel O&amp;M will exit the offshore rig 

building business, after completing the 

existing rigs under construction, and will 

transit to being a developer and integrator 

of offshore energy and infrastructure  

assets, that is well-placed to support the 

global energy transition.

In April 2020, Keppel Infrastructure, through  

a Keppel-led consortium, secured a contract 

worth about $1.5 billion to develop a 

waste-to-energy facility and a materials 

recovery facility for Singapore’s Tuas Nexus 

Integrated Waste Management Facility. This 

will be Singapore’s first integrated facility 

to treat multiple waste streams, and will 

contribute significantly towards the country’s 

long-term waste management plans. 

In June 2020, Keppel Infrastructure also 

commenced commercial operations for 

the Keppel Marina East Desalination Plant 

in Singapore. The plant can produce up 

to 137,000m3 of fresh drinking water 

daily from either seawater or water from 

the Marina Reservoir, depending on the 

prevailing weather conditions. The ability 

to switch from treating rainwater to treating 

seawater during drier seasons strengthens 

Singapore’s water supply resilience in 

the face of increasing rainfall uncertainty 

caused by climate change. 

In the urban development space, Keppel Land 

is actively contributing towards greening 

the built environment. In December 2020, 

Keppel Bay Tower, where Keppel Corporation 

is headquartered, was certified by the 

Building and Construction Authority as 

Singapore’s first Green Mark Platinum 

(Zero Energy) commercial building. We 

see this not just as one isolated example, 

but a demonstration of how we can 

help existing commercial buildings in 

Singapore and overseas become greener, 

or even zero energy buildings, in the years 

to come. 

Keppel Data Centres is exploring floating 

data centre technologies as well as other 

innovative solutions including a cold energy 

harnessing facility and a hydrogen powered 

tri-generation plant to reduce the carbon 

footprint of data centres. It is also partnering 

industry leaders to explore the first 

end-to-end decarbonisation process in 

Singapore that can help reduce carbon 

intensity across key sectors such as 

energy, chemicals and construction. 

Last December, the newly established 

Keppel Renewable Energy also announced 

its first solar farm project in Australia, 

taking the Group a step closer towards 

our target of growing our renewable 

energy portfolio to 7GW by 2030. 

These are just a few examples of the 

many exciting opportunities in sustainable 

solutions that we are seizing across 

the Group. 

With the risks and impact of climate change 

becoming more evident, we are applying 

the lens of sustainability to the Group’s 

major investment decisions. In 2020, we 

started introducing a shadow carbon price 

in the evaluation of all major investments, 

to help us better understand the carbon 

footprint of our business activities, 

the possible impact of future increases 

in carbon taxes, and also avoid potential 

stranded assets. 

STRONG GOVERNANCE 

Keppel is committed to upholding high 

standards of corporate governance. 

We have a strong and independent board, 

with six independent directors out of 

a total of eight directors. We recognise 

that diversity in the composition of the 

Board provides a range of perspectives 

and insights which support good decision-

making, and have in place a Board Diversity 

Policy that sets out the framework and 

approach for the Board on this matter. 

In 2019, Keppel O&amp;M became one of the 

first companies in Singapore to achieve 

global certification for the ISO 37001 

Anti-Bribery Management System. 

Reflecting Keppel’s zero tolerance for 

corruption, we have continued to enhance 

our compliance measures, including 

progressively rolling out the ISO 37001 

Anti-Bribery Management System across 

business units. Apart from Keppel O&amp;M, 

the Singapore entities of both Keppel Land 

and Keppel Data Centres also achieved 

ISO 37001 certification in 2020. 

Our commitment to sustainability is one 

practised at all levels of the company. 

We respect and uphold fair employment 

practices and human rights principles, 

and are committed to the well-being 

of our workforce. In 2020, against the 

backdrop of the pandemic, the Company 

took additional efforts to rigorously 

implement safe management measures 

to ensure the health and safety of our 

employees, partners and other stakeholders, 

both in Singapore and overseas.

I am glad to report that despite the very 

challenging operating environment, our 

employees have remained highly engaged. 

In the 2020 Employee Engagement Survey, 

we achieved an overall employee engagement 

score of 87%, significantly higher than 

Mercer’s global average of 80%, with 91% 

of respondents indicating that they would 

go beyond the norm to contribute to 

Keppel’s success. We also continued 

to be recognised in Forbes’ list of the 

World’s Best Employers 2020.

Safety is one of Keppel’s core values, and 

we continue to enhance the Group’s safety 

performance, including through harnessing 

technology such as using wearables, 

data analytics and artificial intelligence 

to improve our health and safety systems 

and processes. At the Singapore Workplace 

Safety &amp; Health Awards 2020, Keppel 

won 21 awards, the highest number by 

a single organisation for the year. In 2020, 

our total recordable injury rate improved. 

Regrettably, despite our best efforts, the 

Group recorded one fatality at a yard in 

Singapore. We are deeply saddened by the 

loss of our colleague. We have thoroughly 

investigated the incident and put in place 

enhanced training and other measures to 

prevent recurrence. 

We are also committed to sustainable 

procurement and supply chain management. 

Suppliers of the Keppel Group of companies 

are expected to abide by the Keppel Supplier 

Code of Conduct, which covers business 

conduct, labour and environmental aspects. 

In 2020, all new suppliers were screened in 

accordance with environmental, social and 

governance (ESG) criteria, and 100% of 

qualified suppliers endorsed the code or 

have their own codes which met Keppel’s 

requirements. In line with our efforts to 

enhance the well-being of migrant workers, 

Keppel O&amp;M also wrote to its contractors 

and employment agents earlier this year 

to require that they abide by the Dhaka 

Principles for Migration with Dignity 

going forward.

CARING FOR THE COMMUNITY 

Keppel is committed to doing good and 

giving back to the community wherever 

we operate. As a result of COVID-19, a lot 

of our community outreach efforts in 2020 

were focused on building resilience against 

the pandemic. 

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, 

Keppel has committed over $5 million to 

provide support to communities affected 

by the pandemic in Singapore and overseas. 

This included a $4.2 million package to 

support lower income households in 1 and 

2-room HDB flats through rebates given by 

M1, Keppel Electric and City Gas. Assistance 

was also provided to frontline staff, migrant 

workers and others affected by COVID-19. 

The package was funded by voluntary 

contributions from the Keppel Group’s 

directors, senior management and staff, 

with matching contributions from Keppel 

Corporation. We also contributed to the 

Courage Fund and supported the relief 

efforts of the Singapore Red Cross and the 

Shanghai Charity Foundation, among others.

Keppel also supported environmental 

initiatives such as NParks’ OneMillionTrees 

movement, with a $3 million commitment 

that will go towards the planting of 

10,000 trees over the next five years in 

parks and nature reserves in Singapore. 

Keppel Land also worked with the 

Sustainable Singapore Gallery, which 

is managed by PUB, to launch a public 

outreach programme to raise awareness 

on rising sea levels and the urgent need 

for climate action. 

In addition, Keppel made a $2 million 

donation towards a new National Kidney 

Foundation (NKF) dialysis centre at Yishun 

In February 2021, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong (third from left) together with Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, Ms Grace Fu (fourth from right) officiated at the 

opening of the iconic Keppel Marina East Desalination Plant.

Community Hospital, which is the first in 

Singapore to be integrated within a hospital 

compound, and also the first of NKF’s centres 

to offer fully integrated and seamless 

dialysis care for both haemodialysis and 

peritoneal dialysis patients.

Despite the restrictions imposed by  

COVID-19, Keppelites contributed more 

than 10,000 hours of volunteer community 

service globally, including both physical events 

held in compliance with safe management 

measures, as well as creative virtual 

engagement programmes to provide relief 

for beneficiaries, including seniors who have 

been isolated as a result of the pandemic. 

SUPPORTING A GLOBAL COMPACT

Since 2018, Keppel has been a signatory 

of the United Nations Global Compact, 

the world’s largest corporate sustainability 

initiative promoting sustainable business 

practices. We affirm our support of 

the Global Compact’s 10 principles on  

human rights, labour, environment and 

anti-corruption, and this report serves 

as our Communication on Progress. 

We also support the Taskforce on  

Climate-related Financial Disclosures 

and are working towards incorporating 

its recommendations on voluntary 

climate-related disclosures in our 

reporting framework.

Keppel Corporation’s sustainability reporting 

framework and material environmental, 

social and governance (ESG) factors were 

reviewed in 2020 by the Group Sustainability 

Steering and Working Committees and were 

deemed to remain relevant. 

The Company last conducted a comprehensive 

materiality assessment in 2019 which was 

supported by an independent consultant. 

This involved surveys, workshops and 

interviews with around 170 internal and 

external stakeholders, an assessment of 

long-term global trends, and an internal 

review of our businesses. The ESG factors 

defined were prioritised in a matrix. The 

outcome of the process was a revised 

sustainability reporting framework and 

an updated set of material ESG factors 

which were presented to and approved by 

Keppel Corporation’s Board of Directors.

solutions for sustainable urbanisation. 

We will focus on four key areas, namely 

Energy &amp; Environment, Urban Development, 

Connectivity and Asset Management,  

all part of a connected value chain, 

while putting sustainability at the core 

of our strategy.

We are applying the lens of sustainability 

to the Group’s major investment decisions.

all major investments. This would help us 

better understand the carbon footprint of 

our business activities and the possible 

impact of future carbon taxes, and also 

avoid potential stranded assets. Over and 

above running our business in a sustainable 

and environmentally responsible manner, 

we see Keppel playing a significant role 

in helping businesses and communities 

become more sustainable through the 

solutions that we provide. Beyond the 

solutions that Keppel is already well-known 

for, such as waste-to-energy (WTE) and 

water solutions, district cooling plants, 

green buildings and townships, we are 

pushing boundaries to explore and develop 

new solutions that can contribute to 

combatting climate change, while also 

opening up new profit pools for the Group.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

GRI 102-21 | 102-42 | 102-43

Regular engagement with our stakeholders 

helps us refine our material areas of focus. 

We define our stakeholders as groups that 

our business has a significant impact on, 

and those with a vested interest in 

our operations.

We have applied the reporting principles 

from the GRI Standards on defining 

report content, which include stakeholder 

inclusiveness, whereby stakeholders 

are defined as entities or individuals 

that can reasonably be expected to be 

significantly affected by Keppel, or whose 

actions can reasonably be expected to 

affect the ability of Keppel to implement 

the Company’s strategy or achieve 

its objectives.

Keppel conducted a stakeholder consultation 

exercise from December 2018 to April 2019. 

All stakeholder groups were represented in 

the consultation exercise, and their inputs 

informed our comprehensive review of the 

Company’s material ESG factors. Arising 

from the review, a revised sustainability 

reporting framework and an updated set of 

material ESG factors were presented to and 

approved by Keppel Corporation’s Board of 

Directors. Please refer to pages 13 and 14

Stewardship

Climate Action

We seek to grow our business and seize 

opportunities created by macrotrends 

such as climate change, energy transition 

and urbanisation. 

We are refocusing our portfolio on 

sustainable urban solutions, including 

through the use of shadow carbon pricing 

and climate risk assessments. 

Amidst the global energy transition, 

and reflecting Keppel’s commitment to 

support climate action, Keppel Offshore 

&amp; Marine (Keppel O&amp;M) has been pivoting 

towards renewables and cleaner fossil 

fuels such as liquefied natural gas. 

Keppel O&amp;M will also exit the offshore 

rig building business, after completing 

the existing rigs under construction.

The iconic Keppel Marina East Desalination 

Plant, Singapore’s first large-scale, dual-mode 

desalination plant, capable of treating either 

seawater or rainwater from the Marina Reservoir, 

commenced operations in June 2020. It is 

capable of producing about 30 million gallons 

of fresh drinking water per day. In addition, 

the ability to switch from treating rainwater 

to treating seawater during drier seasons 

strengthens Singapore’s water supply 

resilience in the face of increasing rainfall 

uncertainty caused by climate change.

Keppel O&amp;M secured a contract to build the 

first offshore wind turbine installation vessel 

in the US, which is also one of the largest 

vessels of its kind in the world. 

Keppel Renewable Energy entered into an 

agreement to undertake its first solar farm 

project in Australia.

Keppel has adopted an evolutionary shadow 

carbon pricing policy to mitigate climate-related 

risks in the mid to long term, prepare for 

tougher climate legislation and higher 

carbon prices, and also avoid stranded assets. 

It starts at US$20 per tonne of carbon dioxide 

equivalent (tCO2e) in 2020 and will progressively 

increase to US$50/tCO2e over time.

In addition, Keppel supported environmental 

initiatives such as the National Parks Board’s 

OneMillionTrees movement, with a $3 million 

commitment that will go towards the planting 

of 10,000 trees over the next five years in 

parks and nature reserves in Singapore.

In line with Keppel’s focus on sustainability 

and to advance the study of environmental 

sciences, Keppel partnered with the 

Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 

(NTU Singapore) to establish the Keppel 

Environmental Studies Gold Medals. The 

Medals will be awarded to the top graduating 

students of NTU’s Bachelor of Science in 

Environmental Earth Systems Science.

Environmental 

Management

We are committed to minimising our 

environmental impact, and are focused 

on sustainable management and efficient 

use of natural resources. 

We aim to reduce waste generation 

through resource efficiency, recycling 

and reuse of natural resources. 

We have set high-impact sustainability goals 

and publicly committed to long-term targets 

in terms of reducing our carbon intensity, 

as well as waste and water use.

Keppel Bay Tower, where Keppel Corporation 

is headquartered, was certified by the 

Building and Construction Authority (BCA) 

as Singapore’s first Green Mark Platinum 

(Zero Energy) commercial building.

Since the end of 2018, Keppel’s corporate 

headquarters in Singapore has been powered 

by renewable energy. We are also acquiring 

carbon credits to offset Scope 3 emissions 

from business travel and employee commuting, 

thus allowing our corporate office to achieve 

carbon neutrality for the whole of 2020.

Keppel achieved an A- in CDP’s benchmark 

assessment on climate change, and a B- in 

the assessment on water security.

Sustainability

COVID-19 has accelerated many macrotrends, 

such as increasing digitalisation, e-commerce 

and the energy transition, which we had 

identified as part of Vision 2030. 

We believe sustainability can be a good 

business, and will seize opportunities 

in areas such as green developments, 

environmental solutions, renewables, 

new energy and circular economy solutions.

Keppel’s business operations generate 

employment, opportunities for suppliers 

and tax revenues for governments.

We have set targets to invest in  

sustainability-linked innovation, and are 

tapping our engineering nous to explore 

greener solutions such as floating data 

centres, which are more energy efficient  

than traditional land-based ones. We are 

collaborating with partners to study  

hydrogen infrastructure for power  

generation and cooling, as well as  

the development of carbon capture,  

utilisation and sequestration systems. 

Corporate 

Governance  

&amp; Risk 

Management

As part of risk management, Keppel has 

robust business continuity plans in place 

to safeguard against the disruption of 

business operations.

We are committed to being an effective, 

accountable and transparent institution, 

and will conduct ourselves according to 

the highest ethical standards and comply 

with all applicable laws and regulations 

wherever we operate. Our tone on 

regulatory compliance is clear and 

consistently reiterated from the top of 

the organisation. We have zero tolerance 

for fraud, bribery, corruption and violation 

of laws and regulations. 

Keppel’s business continuity plans were 

activated following the COVID-19 outbreak, 

allowing us to continue operating effectively 

despite the implementation of various  

measures to curb the spread of the  

pandemic around the world, including  

working from home.

Keppel’s businesses provide many essential 

services – such as power generation, water 

and waste treatment, telecommunications, 

data centres and logistics – and we continued 

to operate during the pandemic, including 

the Circuit Breaker period in Singapore.

Keppel O&amp;M has complied with and 

successfully concluded the Deferred 

Prosecution Agreement which it had 

entered into with the US Department 

of Justice three years ago. 

Reflecting Keppel’s zero tolerance for corruption, 

we have continued to enhance our compliance 

measures, including rolling out the ISO 37001 

Anti-Bribery Management System across 

business units. Beyond Keppel O&amp;M, which 

had achieved global certification in 2019, the 

Singapore entities of both Keppel Land and 

Keppel Data Centres also achieved ISO 37001 

certification in 2020.

In recognition of Keppel’s strong corporate 

governance disclosures and practices, the 

Company was ranked sixth on the Singapore 

Governance and Transparency Index 2020.

Supply Chain 

&amp; Responsible 

Procurement

The Group recognises the importance 

of supply chain risk management and 

sustainable procurement in building 

operational resilience. 

We are committed to building a resilient 

and diversified supply chain, and we work 

closely with our suppliers to make a positive 

impact on their sustainability performance.

The Group did not experience any major 

supply chain disruptions during the pandemic, 

in part due to the supplier diversification 

programmes in place.

All our suppliers are qualified in accordance 

with our requisition and purchasing policies, 

screened based on ESG criteria, and are 

expected to sign and abide by the Keppel 

Supplier Code of Conduct.

Product Quality 

&amp; Safety

We exercise due care and diligence in the 

design, construction and operation of our 

products and services to ensure that they 

do not pose hazards to customers.

We consider proper design, handling, storage 

and disposal of materials starting from the 

planning stage of our projects. At the project 

execution stage, we carry out project reviews 

and quality assurance programmes.

We will continue to engage our customers 

for continuous service improvements. 

WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE INTERNATIONAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AGENDA, AND LEVERAGE 

COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP TO SUPPORT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE 

DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGs). WE HAVE INCORPORATED 10 OF THE SDGs AS A SUPPORTING FRAMEWORK

Providing a safe and healthy working 

environment for all stakeholders is 

fundamental to our commitment to 

conducting business responsibly. 

We are also strong advocates for safety 

and health in the broader community, and 

champion national and industry initiatives 

to raise standards and drive innovation 

in these aspects. 

Keppel’s first priority in our response to 

the COVID-19 pandemic was to safeguard 

the health and safety of our employees, 

customers and stakeholders. 

Following the start of the pandemic, the Group 

rolled out a series of measures, including 

more frequent cleaning of office facilities and 

temperature screening, as well as implementing 

split teams, alternative work sites, safe distancing 

and working from home where practical. 

In addition, across the Group’s business units, 

pandemic representatives have been identified 

and trained in the protocols and procedures 

to handle confirmed and suspected cases 

of COVID-19. 

From April to June 2020, four COVID-19 

clusters were announced by Singapore’s 

Ministry of Health (MOH) at Keppel Shipyard 

and at the two dormitories operated by 

Keppel Housing. We worked closely with 

the authorities to minimise the spread of the 

coronavirus, including assisting with contact 

tracing, as well as thoroughly deep cleaning 

and disinfecting both workplaces and 

dormitories. As no more new cases were 

linked to these clusters, the clusters were 

progressively closed. All four clusters were 

closed by MOH by August 2020. The two 

dormitories which were gazetted as isolation 

areas in April 2020 were also de-gazetted by 

August 2020 as the situation improved.

The workforce at Keppel O&amp;M’s yards 

in Singapore was reduced from 24,000 in 

early-March 2020 to around 1,200 for 

much of the second quarter of 2020 to 

minimise transmission risk at the workplace. 

The workforce progressively increased 

over time, and reached about 19,500 by 

end-2020, with safe management measures 

in place.

As work resumed at Keppel O&amp;M’s yards, 

we continued to implement robust safe 

management measures to ensure the health 

and safety of our workforce, including migrant 

workers. Such measures include dividing 

the yards into separate zones to further 

increase segregation and reduce the risk 

of transmissions. Shift work arrangements 

were also put in place to reduce the worker 

density at the yard. We are also working 

closely with the Singapore authorities to 

conduct rostered swabbing of the workers.

Beyond Keppel O&amp;M, various safe management 

measures are also being implemented at 

our different worksites, plants and projects 

around the world, in compliance with the 

relevant regulations, to prevent the spread 

of the virus.

Keppel clinched 21 awards at the Workplace 

Safety and Health Awards 2020, which is the 

highest number of awards won by a single

principles set out in the UN Universal 

Declaration of Human Rights and the 

International Labour Organisation’s 

Declaration on Fundamental Principles 

and Rights at Work. Our stance on human 

rights is articulated in the Keppel Group 

Human Rights Policy while our stance on 

diversity and inclusion is articulated in 

our corporate statement on diversity and 

inclusion. Both statements are publicly 

available online.

Keppel is committed to nurturing and developing 

our employees. As part of the Group’s succession 

planning and talent development, we announced 

leadership renewal in a few key business units, 

effective on 15 February 2021.

We continue to actively engage staff, despite 

COVID-19 and work-from-home arrangements. 

We achieved an Employee Engagement Score 

of 87% in 2020, which is higher than Mercer’s 

global average of 80%.

IT collaborative tools and platforms are used to 

facilitate telecommuting, and virtual townhalls 

and other staff engagement initiatives were 

launched to facilitate communication and ensure 

that employees’ needs were addressed despite 

COVID-19. These included team building activities, 

mental wellness talks and virtual fitness classes, 

as well as medical teleconsultation services. 

An employee assistance programme was 

also rolled out to provide mental health support 

for employees and their dependents whereby 

employees can tap on the services of licensed 

counsellors from the Singapore Counselling 

Centre for counselling sessions, if such services 

are needed.

Community 

Development

Through collaboration with our stakeholders, 

we mobilise and share knowledge, expertise 

and technology, as well as financial and 

human resources to support the achievement 

of the SDGs.

We encourage and promote effective public, 

public-private and civil society partnerships 

through the sponsorship and support of 

thought leadership and dialogue platforms. 

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Keppel 

has committed over $5 million to provide support 

to communities affected by the pandemic 

in Singapore and overseas. This includes a 

$4.2 million package to support vulnerable 

communities, including lower income households 

in 1- and 2-room HDB flats who were given 

rebates through M1, Keppel Electric and City Gas. 

Assistance was also provided to frontline staff 

and other communities affected by COVID-19. 

Recognising the challenging environment faced 

by many Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) 

in Singapore, Keppel also improved payment 

terms to SMEs to help improve their cashflow 

over a six-month period.

Beyond supporting those affected by COVID-19, 

Keppel also made a $2 million donation towards 

a new National Kidney Foundation dialysis 

centre at Yishun Community Hospital, which 

commenced operations in November 2020.

Despite the restrictions imposed by COVID-19, 

Keppel Volunteers achieved over 10,000 hours 

of community work in 2020.

In 2020, the Group invested $9.6 million1 in 

social investment spending.

Keppel Care Foundation, the Group’s 

philanthropic arm, has disbursed over 

$47 million since its launch in 2012.

1 Includes voluntary contributions from the Keppel Group’s directors, senior management and staff, to support COVID-19 relief efforts, with matching contributions from 

Keppel Corporation.

HUMAN RIGHTS

Principle 1

Support of human rights

Principle 2

Exclusion of  

human rights abuses

Keppel upholds and respects the fundamental 

principles set out in the UN Universal Declaration 

of Human Rights and the International Labour 

Organisation’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental 

Principles and Rights at Work. 

Our approach to human rights is informed and 

guided by general concepts from the UN Guiding 

Principles on Business and Human Rights.

We respect the values and cultures of the people 

and the communities in which we operate, and 

aim to serve as a positive influence.

Our suppliers are expected to abide by the  

Keppel Supplier Code of Conduct, which sets our 

expectations for suppliers to respect and uphold 

fundamental human rights in their operations.

In the broader community, we contribute towards 

providing educational opportunities to the 

disadvantaged through scholarships and 

bursaries, as well as offer skills development and 

job training opportunities at our workplaces.

We took steps to refine Keppel’s existing Corporate Statement on 

Human Rights to include our commitment to human rights in our 

supply chain as well as provisions in our Whistle-Blower Policy. 

The statement has been renamed Keppel’s Human Rights Policy 

and is made publicly available online. 

Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine (Keppel O&amp;M) conducts regular audits  

of resident subcontractors to ensure their adherence to the ILO’s 

Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and 

Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower Marine Sponsorship Scheme 

requirements for the employment of local and foreign employees. 

The scope of these audits includes fair remuneration, living 

standards, workplace safety and abuse and harassment. 

Where applicable, our business units conduct outreach 

programmes and briefings to subcontractor workers to inform 

them of their employment rights, and the available channels 

to report any violation of their rights.

on pages 84 and 89.

LABOUR

Principle 3

Assurance of freedom 

of association

Principle 4

Elimination of all  

forms of forced and 

compulsory labour

Principle 5

Abolition of child labour

We adhere to national labour laws and regulations 

wherever we operate. In Singapore, both local 

and foreign workers receive protection under 

the Penal Code and employment legislation such  

as the Employment Act and Workplace Safety 

and Health Act. In addition, foreign workers, 

especially the lower-skilled and lower-income 

workers, are accorded additional protection 

under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act 

and the Employment Agencies Act.

We have zero tolerance for unethical labour 

practices such as child labour, forced labour, 

slavery and human trafficking in any of our 

operations. Keppel also supports the elimination 

of exploitative labour.

The Keppel Supplier Code of Conduct sets out the standards of 

conduct which our suppliers are expected to adhere to in relation 

to child labour, forced labour, freedom of association, equal 

opportunity and fair compensation. 

Migrant workers are an important part of Keppel O&amp;M’s workforce. 

In early 2021, Keppel O&amp;M wrote to its contractors and employment 

agents to require that they abide by the Dhaka Principles for 

Migration with Dignity on a going forward basis.

Unions are our partners and we place great emphasis on maintaining 

a harmonious relationship. Approximately 23.5% of our global 

workforce are bargainable employees covered by collective agreements.

 Read more about our labour practices and supplier code of 

conduct on pages 71 to 79, and 57 and 58.

Principle 6

Elimination of 

discrimination

Our hiring policies ensure equal employment 

opportunities for all. New hires are considered 

based on individual competencies as well as 

organisational and job fit. Our employment 

statistics are reviewed regularly and illustrate 

the diversity of our workforce.

In Singapore, Keppel adheres to the tripartite 

guidelines on fair employment practices 

and endorses the employers’ pledge of fair 

employment practices. A key principle espoused 

in the guidelines is that the recruitment of 

employees should be on the basis of merit 

and regardless of race or other characteristics, 

such as age and gender. Keppel is also 

a signatory to the Singapore Business 

Federation’s Sustainable Employment Pledge 

to uplift employees and partners.

The Keppel Group Code of Conduct sets the tone in relation to the 

Group’s stance against discrimination on any basis. Our stance on 

diversity and inclusion is formalised in our corporate statement on 

diversity and inclusion, which is publicly available on our website. 

We adhere to provisions of national laws and regulations concerning 

discrimination wherever we operate. Our company policies and 

procedures make qualifications, skills and experience the basis for 

the recruitment, placement, training and advancement of staff at 

all levels. If any discrimination is identified, guidelines are in place 

for the appropriate handling of any grievance cases to address 

complaints, handle appeals and provide recourse for employees. 

There were no reported incidences of discrimination raised by 

our employees in 2020.

Principle 9

Development and 

diffusion of environmentally 

friendly technologies

We are refocusing our portfolio on sustainable 

urban solutions, including through the 

use of shadow carbon pricing and climate 

risk assessments. 

The Group’s risk-based strategies are used to 

assess, avoid, reduce and mitigate environmental 

risks and impacts. Climate-related risks, including 

physical and transition risks, are incorporated in 

our Enterprise Risk Management framework.

Our approach to environmental management 

covers the following aspects:

• fulfilling compliance obligations;

• protecting the environment by preventing or 

mitigating adverse environmental impacts;

• enhancing environmental performance;

• achieving financial and operational benefits 

that can result from implementing 

environmentally sound alternatives that 

strengthen Keppel’s market position; and

• communicating environmental information 

to relevant interested parties.

Amidst the global energy transition, and reflecting Keppel’s 

commitment to support climate action, Keppel Offshore &amp; 

Marine (Keppel O&amp;M) has been pivoting towards renewables 

and cleaner fossil fuels such as liquefied natural gas. 

It was also announced in 2021 that Keppel O&amp;M would exit 

the offshore rig building business, after completing the existing 

rigs under construction. 

 

We are applying the lens of sustainability to the Group’s major 

investment decisions. With the risks and impact of climate 

change becoming more evident, we have introduced a shadow 

carbon price in the evaluation of all major investments. This 

would help us better understand the carbon footprint of our 

business activities and the possible impact of future carbon 

taxes, and also avoid potential stranded assets. 

All our key business units are certified to the ISO 14001 

Environmental Management System, which guides how we 

identify, manage, monitor and control environmental issues. 

We support the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial  

Disclosures (TCFD), and are working towards incorporating 

its recommendations in our reporting framework.

 Read more about our initiatives to promote greater  

environmental responsibility on pages 24 to 35.

ANTI-CORRUPTION

Principle 10

Measures against corruption

Guided by our core values and the Keppel Group 

Code of Conduct, we are fully committed to 

ensuring that compliance is a central pillar of 

our management and an integral part of our 

corporate culture and business processes. 

We will do business the right way and comply 

with all applicable laws and regulations  

wherever we operate.

Our tone for regulatory compliance is clear 

and consistently reiterated from the top and 

throughout all levels of the Group. We have  

zero tolerance for fraud, bribery, corruption 

and violation of laws and regulations.

Our regulatory compliance governance 

structure is designed to strengthen our  

corporate governance. The Board Risk 

Committee supports the Board in its 

oversight of regulatory compliance and 

is responsible for driving the Group’s 

implementation of effective compliance 

and governance systems.

We continue to improve our risk-based due 

diligence process for all third-party associates 

who represent the Keppel Group in business 

dealings, including our joint venture partners, 

to assess the compliance risk of the business 

partner. In addition to background checks, 

the due diligence process incorporates 

requirements for third-party associates to 

acknowledge understanding and compliance 

with our code of conduct.

Keppel’s Whistle-Blower Policy encourages 

the reporting of suspected bribery, violations 

or misconduct through a clearly-defined 

process and reporting channel, by which 

reports can be made in confidence and without 

fear of reprisal. The whistle-blower reporting 

mechanism, found on page 104 of our 

Company’s Annual Report 2020, is widely 

communicated and made accessible.

We have a strict code of conduct that applies to all employees,  

who are required to acknowledge and comply with the code. 

The code covers areas from conduct in the workplace to business 

conduct, including clear provisions on prohibitions against bribery 

and corruption, and conflicts of interests, amongst others.

We ensure that our compliance policies and procedures are 

communicated effectively to all employees and directors. These 

include policies on anti-bribery, gifts and hospitality, agent fees, 

donations and sponsorships, solicitation and extortion, conflict of 

interest, and insider trading, amongst others.

The procedures and rules defined in the Keppel Group Global 

Anti-Bribery Policy encapsulate key points of the Group’s  

zero-tolerance approach towards bribery.

An e-training and assessment exercise covering all key policies, 

including the Keppel Group Code of Conduct, is carried out an annual 

basis, and targeted training focused on line manager responsibilities 

and employee obligations were conducted in 2020. 17,051 directors 

and employees completed the e-training and toolbox training in 2020.

Enhancements were made to the Group’s compliance programme 

in 2020, including the introduction of a Group-wide Sanctions 

Compliance Policy and the digitalisation of due diligence processes 

through a Group-wide internet sharepoint.

In 2019, Keppel O&amp;M completed the ISO 37001 Anti-Bribery 

Management System certification for its global operations in the 

US, Brazil, Middle East, China, the Philippines, India and Bulgaria, 

thus completing the attainment of ISO 37001 certification at all 

Keppel O&amp;M operating entities globally. In 2020, Keppel Land 

and Keppel Data Centres also obtained ISO 37001 Anti-Bribery 

Management System certification of its operating entities 

in Singapore.

CLIMATE ACTION

STRATEGIC PILLAR: ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP


OUR CLIMATE ACTION PLEDGE

OVERVIEW

GRI 103-1

There is growing international recognition of 

the risks posed by climate change and the 

need for decisive international action. 

In March 2020, Singapore submitted its 

enhanced nationally determined contribution 

under the Paris Agreement, with the aim to 

peak its emissions around 2030, halve the 

emissions from its 2030 peak by 2050, and 

achieve net zero emissions as soon as viable 

in the second half of the century. In working 

towards this target, the Singapore government 

introduced a carbon tax, under the Carbon 

Pricing Act, which came into force in 2019. 

The tax is applied on the total direct emissions 

of facilities that emit 25,000 tonnes of 

carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) or more 

of emissions annually. In February 2021, 

the government further announced it will 

review the trajectory and level of the 

carbon tax, post 2023.

Keppel is committed to support efforts 

by the international community and the 

Singapore government to address 

climate change.

Climate action has been included as a material 

ESG factor for the Group since 2019. As part 

of Keppel’s Vision 2030, we are progressively 

guiding and refocusing our portfolio towards 

sustainable urbanisation solutions, through 

evaluating their fit with Keppel’s Vision, 

Mission and ESG goals, as well as through 

shadow carbon pricing and climate risk 

assessments. We have set high-impact 

sustainability goals and publicly committed 

to long-term targets to reduce our carbon, 

waste and water intensity. 

Keppel is placing sustainability at the core 

of our strategy. Beyond reducing carbon 

emissions or the environmental impact 

of our operations, we believe in making 

sustainability our business, by developing 

solutions that contribute to combatting 

climate change and building a cleaner 

and greener world.

REPORT BOUNDARY

GRI 102-48 | 103-1 | 305-1 | 305-2 | 305-3

The boundaries for the material topics 

of climate action and environmental 

performance report include the Group’s 

major subsidiaries in Singapore and 

overseas operations in which the Group 

has operational control. This includes 

Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine (Keppel O&amp;M), 

Keppel Land, Keppel Infrastructure, Keppel 

Telecommunications &amp; Transportation, 

Keppel Capital and M1. 

Over the past two years, we reviewed and 

adjusted our approach, reporting boundaries 

and calculation methodology in accounting 

for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 

closer alignment with the requirements of 

an operational control approach under the 

GHG Protocol. We now account for 100% of 

Scopes 1 and 2 emissions from operations 

over which we have operational control. For 

assets that are considered as investments1, 

we report our equity share of emissions 

under Scope 3. We started tracking emissions 

from business travel2 since 2019, and 

emissions from fuel- and energy-related 

activities (not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2), 

as well as waste generated in operations in 

2020. These emissions are accounted for 

under Scope 3. Our three-year environmental 

performance data is disclosed on page 30.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

GRI 103-2 | 103-3

We are committed to do our part to combat 

climate change. As we grow our businesses 

and portfolios, our investment decisions will 

carefully consider environmental sustainability.

In order to mitigate climate-related risks in 

the medium to long term, as well as prepare 

for tougher climate legislation and higher 

carbon prices, we further strengthened our 

commitment to sustainability by introducing 

a shadow carbon price (SCP) in the 

evaluation of all major investment decisions. 

This involves assigning a hypothetical price 

on carbon internally to reflect current 

industry practices and align with the 

mid- and long-term carbon prices forecast 

by the International Energy Agency 

and Carbon Price Leadership Coalition. 

The carbon price we have set starts at 

US$20/tCO2e in 2020 and will progressively 

increase to US$50/tCO2e over time. The 

SCP will allow Keppel’s businesses to factor 

in the carbon footprint of our investments, 

encourage the adoption of mitigation 

measures and technologies, and channel 

investments towards initiatives and 

innovations that benefit the environment. 

The SCP was implemented in September 

2020 and will continue to be reviewed and 

refined over time.

1  According to the GHG Protocol’s definition of 

Investment, which includes equity investments 

(including investments in subsidiaries, associate 

companies and joint ventures), debt investments, 

project finance, managed investments and 

client services.

2  The Group’s travel agency provides a centralised 

data source for business travel. Emissions from 

business travel are calculated using International 

Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)’s online carbon 

emissions calculator.

WE ARE COMMITTED TO CLIMATE ACTION, 

IMPROVING RESOURCE EFFICIENCY AND 

REDUCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT.

We have defined the kinds of pollutive 

sectors we will not go into, such as 

coal-fired plants, the businesses we will 

maintain, and those which we will focus 

more on, such as renewables. We have 

established a new business unit, Keppel 

Renewable Energy, to pursue opportunities 

for Keppel as a developer, owner and 

operator of renewable energy infrastructure. 

We will also look into re-purposing our 

existing technology to seize opportunities 

in renewables.

As a signatory to the UN Global Compact, 

we are committed to upholding its principles, 

including taking a precautionary approach 

to environmental challenges, promoting 

greater environmental responsibility, and 

encouraging the development and diffusion 

of environmentally friendly technologies.

KEPPEL CORPORATION’S  

CLIMATE ACTION PLEDGE

As a solutions provider for sustainable 

urbanisation, Keppel Corporation pledges 

our commitment to support efforts by 

the international community and the

STRATEGY

Actual and  

potential impacts 

of climate-related 

risks and 

opportunities.

Keppel’s mission is to deliver solutions for sustainable urbanisation safely, responsibly and profitably. Our suite 

of solutions for energy and environment, urban development, connectivity and asset management help cities 

urbanise in a sustainable manner.

The Group considers environmental factors during the planning and design of our projects and assets,  

such as urban and infrastructure developments, as well as during their operational phases. We have also 

introduced a shadow carbon price in the evaluation of all major investment decisions.

Over and above running our business in a sustainable and environmentally responsible manner, we see 

Keppel playing a significant role in helping businesses and communities become more sustainable through  

the solutions that we provide. 

Keppel Renewable Energy pursues opportunities as a developer, owner and operator of renewable energy 

infrastructure. We have also been re-purposing our technology, such as in the offshore and marine business,  

to seize opportunities in renewables. 

We are also tapping our engineering nous to explore greener solutions such as floating data centres, which are 

more energy efficient than land-based ones. To work towards decarbonising data centre operations, we are 

collaborating with partners to study hydrogen infrastructure for power generation and cooling, as well as the 

development of carbon capture, utilisation and sequestration systems.

RISK 

MANAGEMENT

Processes used  

to identify, assess, 

and manage 

climate-related risks.

Risks and opportunities relating to climate change have been recognised as being fundamental to the 

Group. These relate to physical and transitional risks stemming from climate change and environmental 

management, which present both risks and opportunities for the Group. 

A Sustainability Risk Framework, aligned to the Group’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework, 

guides the Group on the specific processes and methods applied in identifying, assessing and managing 

sustainability-related risks and opportunities.

The Group initiated a high-level physical risk assessment which is evaluating the potential impact of seven 

climate-related hazards – sea level rise, heatwave, water stress, flood, wildfire, coldwave and hurricane –  

on 50 key assets globally. Scenarios used are based on Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6,  

RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, with projections for 2030 and 2050. These assets include commercial buildings, 

residential projects and townships, data centres as well as water and waste management plants. Based on 

the findings of the assessment, the respective business units will consider and prioritise possible mitigation/

adaptation actions to be taken, where necessary. 

Beyond managing climate-related risks and opportunities under the ERM framework, all our key business units 

are certified to the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System, which guides how we identify, manage, 

monitor and control environmental issues. The Group is also actively pursuing opportunities to harness its 

capabilities to provide solutions for sustainable urbanisation, which can help to reduce climate-related risks.

51 to 54

METRICS AND 

TARGETS

Metrics and targets 

used to assess and 

manage climate-

related risks and 

opportunities which 

are material to  

our business.

To support the climate change agenda, we have targets to reduce our carbon emissions intensity, and are 

looking into setting an absolute emissions reduction target.

We have been tracking our Scopes 1 and 2 emissions since 2010, and have started tracking Scope 3 emissions 

since 2019. We will progressively expand monitoring and reporting of Scope 3 emissions where possible. 

In measuring and reporting our greenhouse gas emissions, we reference global standards including the 

GHG Protocol Corporate Standard and Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard, and use the operational 

control approach in accounting for our emissions.

We have also set targets in 2019 to reduce waste generation and water consumption, as well as invest 

in renewable energy generation.

SUSTAINABLE DESIGN

In line with our mission of providing 

solutions for sustainable urbanisation, 

the Group considers environmental factors 

during the planning and design of our 

projects and assets such as urban and 

infrastructure developments, as well as 

during their operational phases.

A leading green developer, Keppel Land 

has to date garnered a total of 87 BCA 

Green Mark Awards across its properties in 

Singapore, China, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, 

Myanmar and the Philippines, including  

one Platinum (Zero Energy) and 17 Platinum 

Awards. The total estimated reduction in 

energy consumption from all of Keppel Land’s 

87 BCA Green Mark-awarded projects, 

when they are fully completed, will be over 

270 million kilowatt hours (kWh) per annum, 

which is the equivalent amount of energy 

required to power about 55,000 homes 

in Singapore for one year. This translates 

to cost savings of about $65 million, 

a carbon emissions reduction of about 

112,000 tonnes annually, and an estimated 

annual water savings of about 2.7 million 

cubic metres (m3).

In 2020, Keppel Land was conferred the 

prestigious BCA Quality Excellence Award 

– Quality Champion (Platinum) for the second 

consecutive year, for its commitment 

and consistent achievement in developing 

high-quality buildings through workmanship 

excellence and quality assurance programmes.

In 2020, Keppel Bay Tower became the 

first commercial building in Singapore to be  

certified a Green Mark Platinum (Zero Energy) 

building by the BCA, featuring new and 

innovative energy efficient technologies 

including an intelligent building control system,  

a smart lighting system, high efficiency air 

distribution system, cooling tower water 

management system, and an integrated 

sensor system to optimise fresh air intake. 

In Singapore, Keppel Land received the 

BCA Construction Excellence Award (Merit) 

for the Highline Residences, the BCA 

Universal Design Mark Gold (Design) Award 

for The Garden Residences, as well as 

the BCA Green Mark GoldPlus Awards for its 

upcoming residential developments, The Reef 

at King’s Dock and 19 Nassim, for energy  

efficient features and extensive greenery 

with fully automated irrigation systems. 

In the same year, Marina Bay Financial Centre 

Towers 1 and 2, as well as Marina Bay Link 

Mall, were re-certified with the BCA Green 

Mark Platinum Award. Marina Bay Financial 

Centre is fitted with a myriad of sustainable 

features, including an outdoor weather 

station that measures external temperatures 

to regulate indoor air conditioning, LED 

lighting fixtures, as well as green building 

monitors that publish energy and 

water consumption.

Keppel Land also won the BCA SGBuilds 

Awards in the Developer category for its 

projects in China, Vietnam and Indonesia. 

The awards recognise progressive 

Singapore firms in the built environment 

sector for their successful collaboration in 

expanding and strengthening Singapore’s 

foothold in overseas markets, with an aim 

to foster stronger partnership and regional 

networks across the entire built environment 

value chain. 

In June 2020, Singapore’s fourth desalination 

plant, the Keppel Marina East Desalination 

Plant (KMEDP), commenced commercial 

operations. Developed by Keppel Infrastructure 

under the Design, Build, Own and Operate 

(DBOO) arrangement with PUB, Singapore’s 

National Water Agency, KMEDP is Singapore’s 

first large-scale, dual-mode desalination plant, 

with the ability to treat either rainwater or 

seawater, depending on prevailing weather 

conditions. In dry weather, KMEDP will draw 

water from the sea to produce desalinated 

water. During rainy weather, the plant will 

utilise rainwater collected in the reservoir 

to produce potable water, which requires 

less energy and fewer steps in the treatment 

process compared to desalination. The 

plant is capable of producing 137,000m3 

of fresh drinking water per day, and will 

strengthen Singapore’s water supply 

resilience in the face of increasingly dry 

weather conditions caused by 

climate change.

Seamlessly integrated with the 

surrounding greenery, KMEDP features 

nearly 20,000 square metres of open 

green rooftop space for community activity 

and recreation. The plant’s treatment 

facilities are situated underground. For its 

outstanding design features and exceptional 

Active, Beautiful, Clean (ABC) standards, 

KMEDP became the first industrial plant in 

Singapore to be awarded the ABC Waters 

Certification (Gold) by PUB in October 2019. 

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong officially 

opened the plant in February 2021.

In 2020, Keppel O&amp;M commissioned 

a study conducted by environmental 

consultancy Environmental Resources 

Management, to assess its conversion of 

a Liquefied Natural Gas Carrier (LNGC) 

into a Floating Liquefaction Vessel (FLNG) 

using a design and execution model jointly 

engineered by Keppel O&amp;M and Golar 

LNG Limited (Golar). The study concluded 

that such conversion projects reduce 

approximately 33% of greenhouse gas 

(GHG) emissions compared to an FLNG 

new build. For more information on the 

FLNG conversion project study, please refer

RENEWABLE ENERGY

The Group has a target to grow our portfolio 

of renewable energy assets to 7 GW by 

2030 and has continued to promote the 

generation and usage of renewable energy. 

KEPPEL RENEWABLE ENERGY

Established in 2019 to pursue opportunities 

for the Group as a developer, owner and 

operator of renewable energy infrastructure, 

Keppel Renewable Energy (KRE) in 2020 

announced it had signed an agreement to 

develop a large-scale, greenfield solar farm 

in Queensland, Australia. This is KRE’s

first solar farm project. The project is in 

line with Keppel’s Vision 2030, which puts 

sustainability at the core of the Group’s 

strategy, and envisages the Group 

growing its renewable energy portfolio 

as it contributes to the accelerating 

energy transition.

The project will be located on a more 

than 2,000-hectare site, and KRE will 

take the lead role in the development and 

management of the construction and 

operation of the solar farm. 

To maximise energy yield, KRE intends to 

employ modern solar module technology 

which will enable the panels to follow the 

path of the sun. With a projected capacity 

of at least 500 MW, the solar farm will 

generate enough energy to power more 

than 142,000 average Australian homes, 

achieving an estimated annual reduction 

of 800 kilotonnes of carbon emissions 

compared to the power generated for 

the current Queensland energy grid. 

Construction of the solar farm is projected 

to commence in 2022 and complete in 

2023. When operationally ready, the solar 

farm will be connected to the national 

energy market for public consumption 

and will provide renewable energy for 

businesses seeking sustainable energy 

solutions, including Keppel-related 

companies in Australia.

OFFSHORE RENEWABLES

In 2020, Keppel O&amp;M secured a contract 

worth around $600 million for the engineering, 

procurement and construction of a Wind 

Turbine Installation Vessel (WTIV) for a 

United States energy company, Dominion 

Energy Inc.

Scheduled for delivery in 2023, it will be 

available for charter hire to offshore wind 

developers, in support of several US 

wind projects. The vessel is expected to 

be fully utilised on US East Coast projects 

exceeding 5 gigawatts of US offshore wind 

construction through to 2027.

Keppel O&amp;M provides design and construction 

solutions across the value chain of offshore 

wind farms, such as wind turbine foundations, 

substation platforms, as well as installation 

and support vessels. It is currently building 

converter stations and substations to 

support the offshore wind energy industry 

in the German sector of the North Sea 

and Taiwan. It delivered and has a stake in 

Blue Tern, one of the world’s largest and 

most advanced multipurpose offshore wind 

turbine installers for the United Kingdom 

North Sea.

GREEN FINANCING

Reflecting the Group’s commitment to 

sustainability, Keppel business units, 

namely Keppel REIT, Keppel Infrastructure 

Trust and Keppel Energy, secured a total 

of $1,010 million in green loan facilities 

in 2020. This brings the cumulative 

green loan facilities secured by the 

Group to $1,835 million as at end-2020.

In 2020, Keppel REIT secured  

$310 million in green loans partially 

used to finance the acquisition of 

Pinnacle Office Park, a freehold Grade A 

commercial development in Sydney, 

adding to the $825 million in green 

loan facilities obtained in 2019 

by Keppel Land and Keppel REIT 

to finance green projects and grow 

their green building portfolios. 

Keppel Infrastructure Trust (KIT) and 

Keppel Energy obtained a seven-year 

$700 million sustainability-linked loan 

for their gas-fired co-generation plant, 

Keppel Merlimau Cogen (KMC) Plant. 

The loan is tied to carbon emissions 

targets, including benchmarking KMC’s 

carbon emissions intensity against national 

indices, and demonstrating continuous 

improvement in the plant’s carbon 

emissions intensity. The interest rate 

on the loan will be reduced on a tiered 

basis subject to the meeting of these 

pre-determined targets. The loan  

will strengthen KIT’s sustainability 

efforts across its portfolio, where many 

of its assets have already incorporated 

best-in-class technologies to support 

sustainable urban infrastructure.

The 1,040,420GJ in savings comprise savings from the reduced usage of fossil fuels, such as diesel, and 

a reduction in electricity consumed. The amount of savings in absolute terms is the difference in consumption 

before and after the implementation of an energy efficiency project. The savings are converted to energy 

equivalent in GJ based on the corresponding energy conversion factors for fossil fuels and electricity published 

in the United Kingdom’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 2020 (DEFRA 2020) Government 

GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting. A significant proportion of the savings are achieved through 

cumulative green initiatives implemented at Keppel Land’s Green Mark certified developments, upon 

completion of these initiatives.

2 

Estimated monetary savings are calculated based on the average electricity tariff rates in 2019 as published 

by SP Group, whereby 1 kWh = $0.2362.

3 

The electricity savings in carbon dioxide equivalent was estimated by multiplying the energy savings in kWh 

with the Electricity Grid Emission Factors for 2019 from Singapore’s Energy Market Authority (EMA), whereby  

1 kWh = 0.4085 kg CO2.

of indirect energy in 2019. The data includes 

direct energy used in activities carried out  

by both employees and contractors at 

our worksites.

IMPROVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY

The Group is estimated to have saved 

1,040,420 GJ1 of energy from its energy 

efficiency initiatives in 2020 and through 

cumulative green initiatives implemented 

at Keppel Land’s Green Mark-certified 

developments. The total energy savings 

is equivalent to about 54% of the Group’s 

total energy consumption in 2020, and 

translates to estimated cost savings 

of about $68 million2 and an avoidance 

of approximately 120,000 tCO2e 

in emissions3.

These savings were achieved through the 

optimisation of operations and processes; 

technological improvements, including 

the adoption of more sustainable building 

designs and materials; and the use of 

energy-efficient equipment and devices. 

Examples of initiatives undertaken in 

2020 include:

• Optimisation of chilled water system 

at Keppel DHCS’ plants at Mediapolis, 

Changi Business Park and Woodlands 

Wafer Fab Park, which achieved energy 

savings of 240,000 kWh;

• Implementation of smart building 

energy management system (BEMS) at 

Keppel Bay Tower that has yielded total 

energy savings of 1,700,000 kWh as at 

end-2020; and

• Upgrading to LED lightings and high bay 

lamps at our warehouses which produced 

total annual energy savings of 11,000 kWh.

WATER &amp; EFFLUENTS

GRI 303-1 | 303-3 

Water is a precious resource, and an 

effective and reliable supply of water is 

vital in the operation of our assets including 

commercial buildings, data centres, 

warehouses, shipyards and district 

cooling assets. 

Upstream processes such as construction 

require water for manufacturing of raw 

materials, cooling of processes and 

commissioning of projects. Downstream, 

water is used for drinking, cleaning, and 

general purposes.

The World Resources Institute’s (WRI) 

Aqueduct tool is used to measure the 

levels of water stress across the Group’s 

areas of operations. To mitigate water 

stress, the Group continues to strengthen 

its water conservation efforts through 

initiatives such as promoting water-saving 

practices, adopting water-efficient 

technologies and equipment, as well as 

implementing process improvements and 

investing in water infrastructure, such 

as the Keppel Marina East Desalination 

Plant, to improve water security. Keppel 

has also set a Group-wide water intensity 

reduction target of 20% to reduce water 

stress and water related-impacts. For 

FY 2020, the Group achieved a weighted 

reduction of 5.2% in water intensity.

Water withdrawn by the Group includes 

potable water (water from local catchment 

we have achieved a weighted 

average reduction of 35.0% in 

waste intensity compared to the 

2019 baseline.

Waste is segregated at our offices, 

plants and yards to promote reuse and 

recycling. Used papers from our offices 

as well as scrap metals and damaged 

equipment recovered from our shipyards 

are sent for recycling. Hazardous waste 

generated is handled, stored and 

disposed in a manner that adheres 

to best practices and meets local 

regulatory requirements.

Waste recycled included ferrous scrap, 

grits, plastic stretch wrap, paper and other 

office consumables. In 2020, the Group 

recycled 64,688 tonnes (t) of refuse, an 

increase from 41,904 t of waste recycled 

in 2019. 

In land-scarce Singapore, refuse is 

incinerated at WTE plants to reduce the 

volume of waste and to remove harmful 

substances before disposal at the landfill. 

Heat from the incineration of waste 

is recovered to produce electricity. 

Incineration is also preferable to land filling 

in Singapore and many other countries, 

as the direct burial of waste produces 

significant amounts of methane, a GHG. 

As a Group, a total of 12,753 t of waste 

was sent for incineration in 2020, which 

is an approximately 51% decrease 

compared to 25,957 t in 2019.

In December 2020, Keppel Bay Tower 

became the first commercial building 

in Singapore to be certified by the BCA 

as a Green Mark Platinum (Zero Energy) 

building. BCA’s recognition was an 

affirmation of efforts by Keppel Land 

to leverage technological innovations to 

enhance the environmental performance 

of its buildings. Beyond this one example, 

this is a demonstration of how Keppel 

can help existing commercial buildings 

in Singapore and overseas become 

greener, or even zero energy buildings. 

In 2018, Keppel Land was awarded 

a grant of up to $1.28 million under 

the programme, to implement new and 

emerging energy-efficient technologies 

at Keppel Bay Tower. Energy-efficient 

technologies including a high-efficiency 

air distribution system, an innovative 

cooling tower water management system, 

integrated sensor technology to optimise 

fresh air intake, smart LED lighting 

solutions, and an intelligent building 

control system were piloted at  

Keppel Bay Tower. 

By February 2020, Keppel Land has 

achieved a reduction of 22.3% in annualised 

energy consumption of the building, 

exceeding its initial target of 20%. 

Following the successful pilot, some 

of these technologies, such as the 

high-efficiency air distribution system, 

are currently being replicated to the rest of 

the building. In addition, the installation of 

an assembly of photovoltaic (PV) panels 

spanning over 400m2 on the roof of the 

18-storey Keppel Bay Tower, as well as its 

six-storey podium block was completed in 

March 2021, and will generate an energy 

yield of about 100,000 kWh per annum.

Upon completion of these initiatives, 

Keppel Bay Tower’s annual energy 

consumption will be less than 115 kWh/m2 

per year, a reduction of over 30% from 

its 2017 Green Mark Platinum level and 

almost 50% less compared to typical 

office buildings in Singapore. This 

translates to energy savings of over 

2.2 million kWh a year and cost savings 

of approximately $400,000 annually.

Since 2019, Keppel Land has achieved 

100% participation from all its office 

tenants at Keppel Bay Tower in signing 

green leases, which is a demonstration 

of the company’s commitment to work 

with its tenants to provide energy-efficient, 

resource-efficient and healthier interior 

spaces for building occupants. The 

green leases have incorporated the 

requirements of the BCA-HPB Green Mark 

(for Healthier Workplaces) Certified 

standard, which focuses on the health 

and well-being of building occupants in 

green offices.

inclusion of reservoir water and seawater 

withdrawn for treatment by the Keppel 

Marina East Desalination Plant, which 

commenced commercial operations in 

June 2020.

Recycling of cooling tower blowdown 

water at our district cooling plants have 

helped to save 55,000 m3 of water annually. 

Water consumption reduction efforts 

include a cooling tower management 

system at Keppel Bay Tower that is

As incineration of refuse is prohibited 

or unavailable in some countries where 

we operate, a total of 8,053 t of municipal 

waste was disposed at landfill sites  

in 2020, an increase over 6,286 t in 2019. 

Incineration is banned in the Philippines, 

while waste disposal regulations in the

waste to be landfilled.

In line with our efforts to proactively 

manage the environmental impact of 

our operations, the Group started tracking 

data in 2020 on hazardous waste 

generated. A total of 5,456 t of hazardous 

waste was generated in 2020, all of 

which was disposed by licensed toxic 

waste collectors.

In calculating emissions intensity reductions, each business division first computes its base year (i.e. 2010) 

emissions intensity using a normalising factor relevant to its business activity. The total emissions intensity 

reduction is the difference in the Group’s average emissions intensity between the base year and the current 

year in which the data is reported. The normalisation factors for our business divisions are based on their key 

activities and industry best practices. They are as follows: gross floor area in square metres for office and retail 

premises, million man-hours for Keppel O&amp;M and Keppel Logistics, refrigeration tonnes hour for our district 

heating and cooling plants; kilowatt hour of IT power for data centres, as well as revenue generated for M1.

levels. This is based on the national targets 

which the Singapore government had 

disclosed in 2009.

In support of the Paris Agreement, 

Singapore announced its intended nationally 

determined contribution of reducing GHG 

emissions intensity by 36% from 2005 levels 

by 2030. In line with the government’s 

commitment, we have set a long-term 

target of a 28.8% reduction in carbon 

emissions intensity from 2010 levels by 

2030 for our global operations1. Our target 

was derived by adjusting the national target 

to a shorter timeframe, as data prior to 

2010 is unavailable. 

As at end-2020, our operations in Singapore 

and overseas have achieved a 29.4% 

average reduction in carbon emissions 

intensity from our 2010 baseline, thus 

achieving and exceeding the 2020 target of 

a 16% improvement in carbon emissions

The GHG conversion factors for direct (Scope 1) emissions, as well as Global Warming Potential values used 

are based on DEFRA 2020 Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting. The GHG conversion 

factors for indirect (Scope 2) emissions are based on the Electricity Grid Emission Factors for 2019 from EMA. 

For other overseas regions, grid emission factors from the International Energy Agency 2020 data set were 

used. The GHG emission Scopes 1, 2 and 3 are as defined by the GHG Protocol, whereby Scope 1 refers to 

emissions from company owned and operated facilities, machines, vehicles, etc. The primary sources of energy 

consumed on site by our operations are diesel, liquefied petroleum gas, naphtha, piped natural gas, from 

the generation of purchased electricity consumed by the company; Scope 3 emissions are a consequence of 

the activities of the company, but occur from sources not owned or controlled by the company, including 

investments and business travel.

intensity. Given the progress achieved with 

our existing commitments, we are looking 

into how Keppel can further enhance its 

carbon emissions reduction target, including 

setting an absolute emissions reduction 

target aligned with climate science and 

Singapore’s national targets.

The Singapore government implemented 

a carbon tax in 2019. The carbon tax is set 

at a rate of $5 per tCO2e from 2019 to 2023. 

Singapore will review the carbon tax rate 

by 2023, with plans to increase it to between 

$10 and $15 per tCO2e by 2030. The tax is 

applied upstream, for example, on power 

stations and other large direct emitters. 

The carbon tax would have an impact on 

business cost. To mitigate the impact of 

the carbon tax, and in line with the Group’s 

commitment to sustainability, we have 

continued to improve our energy efficiency 

and reduce our carbon footprint, particularly 

for businesses that are energy intensive.

CARBON EMISSIONS1 

In 2020, total direct (Scope 1) emissions 

from the use of fuels across the Group was 

41,973 tCO2e, registering a 41.9% increase 

from 29,577 tCO2e in 2019. The increase 

was mainly due to refrigerant leakage at 

a warehouse under Keppel Logistics, which 

required frequent top-ups before the problem 

was resolved, as well as an increase 

in activities at overseas yards. Indirect 

(Scope 2) emissions from electricity use 

was 181,928 tCO2, which is a 9.4% decrease 

from 200,759 tCO2 in 2019. Total Scope 1 

and Scope 2 emissions fell 2.8% year-on-year.

The Group’s total other indirect (Scope 3) 

emissions was 1,909,158 tCO2e in 2020, 

with 1,793,867 tCO2e from investments2; 

106,912 tCO2e from fuel- and energy-related 

activities not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2; 

552 tCO2e from business travel and 7,978 tCO2e 

from waste generated in operations. 

Since end-2018, Keppel Corporation’s 

corporate office has been fully powered by 

renewable energy. In addition, the Group 

also acquired carbon credits to offset its 

Scope 3 emissions from business travel and 

employee commuting totalling 47 tCO2e, 

thus allowing our corporate office to 

achieve carbon neutrality for the year. 

The purchased carbon credits supports 

a biodiversity reserve project in Indonesia, 

which aims to prevent deforestation and 

peatland drainage, and contributes toward 

the Sustainable Development Goals. 

COMPLIANCE

GRI 306-3 | 307-1

There were no records of spillages, 

no sanctions pertaining to spillages and 

non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance 

with environmental laws and regulations 

that were administered by Singapore or 

overseas authorities on the Group in 2020. 

In 2020, the main contractor appointed 

by Keppel Land for a residential project in 

Singapore was fined $70,000 and $55,000 

by the National Environment Agency for a 

mosquito breeding incident and for exceeding 

permissible noise levels respectively.

STRATEGIC PILLAR: ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP


PROMOTING  

A CIRCULAR ECONOMY



Keppel’s solutions for the circular economy – such as the world’s first converted FLNG, Hilli Episeyo – contribute to 

building a sustainable future and advancing climate action.

Keppel is committed to create solutions 

that advance climate action and the 

circular economy.

With the energy transition and push 

towards cleaner fuels, companies in the 

offshore and marine industry are exploring 

more sustainable solutions that can 

quantifiably reduce their carbon footprint. 

With its deep expertise and extensive 

track record in vessel conversions, 

Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine (Keppel O&amp;M) 

is well-positioned to help its customers 

reduce their environmental footprint through 

circular economy solutions.

In 2020, Keppel O&amp;M commissioned a study 

by Environmental Resources Management 

(ERM), to assess converted and new build 

Floating Liquefaction Vessels (FLNGs) 

across three stages of the project life cycle, 

namely the end of life of the LNG tanker, 

repurposing or shipbuilding of the FLNG, 

and maintenance of the FLNG.

According to the study, Keppel O&amp;M’s 

conversion of a Liquefied Natural Gas 

Carrier (LNGC) into an FLNG using a design 

and execution model jointly engineered by 

Keppel O&amp;M and Golar LNG Limited (Golar), 

was estimated to have reduced approximately 

33% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 

compared to an FLNG new build.

The study, which assessed the converted 

FLNG Hilli Episeyo and a new build FLNG 

of a comparable design and specification, 

concluded that the converted FLNG saved 

a total of 63,343 tonnes of GHG emissions 

– equivalent to taking around 13,500 cars 

off the road for a year.

Repurposing LNGCs into FLNGs contributes 

to the circular economy, extending vessel 

life by decades and recapturing value that 

would have been lost through disposal, 

as well as reducing the consumption of 

materials that would have been needed 

for a new build. For example, 39% less 

virgin steel was used for the converted 

FLNG Hilli Episeyo, reducing GHG emissions 

significantly. From a commercial perspective, 

a converted FLNG is also more cost-effective 

and faster-to-market. 

Hilli Episeyo – the world’s first converted 

FLNG – has performed consistently, 

providing proof of concept and attesting 

to the innovative and reliable solution 

put forth by Keppel O&amp;M and Golar. The 

FLNG has maintained 100% commercial 

uptime since its delivery in 2017, and 

surpassed its 52nd cargo dispatch in 

Q1 2021.

Keppel O&amp;M is currently undertaking its 

second FLNG conversion, Gimi, for Golar 

which is being repurposed for the 20-year 

BP Greater Tortue Ahmeyim contract 

offshore West Africa.

ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY


In line with our disciplined approach to capital allocation and proactively unlocking capital that can be recycled into 

growth opportunities, we announced the monetisation of over $1.2 billion of assets from October to December 2020, 

including Keppel Bay Tower (pictured) in Singapore. 



URBANISATION TRENDS PRESENT MANY 

EXCITING AND INTERCONNECTED OPPORTUNITIES 

FOR KEPPEL, AS WE PROVIDE SOLUTIONS FOR 

SUSTAINABLE URBANISATION.

OVERVIEW

GRI 103-1

In May 2020, Keppel unveiled Vision 2030, 

our long-term strategy to guide the 

Group’s growth and development. While 

the macrotrends that Vision 2030 seeks 

to address, such as rapid urbanisation, 

the energy transition, climate change, 

digitalisation and super liquidity, were 

identified pre-COVID-19, they remain highly 

relevant today. If anything, some of these 

trends have been further accelerated 

by the pandemic.

At the same time, international concerns 

about climate change continue to grow, 

accelerating the energy transition and 

spurring the need for different solutions 

that contribute to a more sustainable future. 

Together, these trends are expected to 

further drive the demand for solutions for 

sustainable urbanisation, and create new 

opportunities for the Group.

As one integrated business, Keppel will 

harness the strengths of the Group to meet 

the world’s growing needs for sustainable 

urbanisation solutions. Keppel is deepening 

intra-company collaboration and adopting 

a OneKeppel approach to leverage the 

synergies of the Group and capture 

profit pools that might not be available 

to individual business entities.

REPORT BOUNDARY

GRI 103-1

The reporting boundary for financial data 

in this section is the same as that of 

Keppel Corporation’s Annual Report 2020.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

GRI 103-1 | 103-2 | 103-3

As part of Vision 2030, Keppel is progressively 

guiding and refocusing its portfolio towards 

sustainable urbanisation solutions, through 

evaluating its fit with Keppel’s Vision, 

Mission and environmental, social and 

governance (ESG) goals, as well as adopting 

shadow carbon pricing and implementing 

climate risk assessments.

In September 2020, Keppel announced 

a $3-5 billion asset monetisation 

programme over three years, to free up 

the Group’s balance sheet to pursue 

new growth opportunities. Between 

October and December 2020, the Group 

announced divestments worth over 

$1.2 billion, well on its way to meeting 

the three-year target, as well as various 

new initiatives to take Keppel forward on 

its growth trajectory. 

Keppel also announced bold plans to 

transform Keppel O&amp;M to be more relevant 

and competitive amidst the global energy 

transition. Keppel O&amp;M will exit the offshore 

rig building business, after completing 

its existing uncompleted rigs, and will 

progressively exit low value-adding repairs 

and other activities with low bottom-line 

contribution. Keppel O&amp;M will instead 

transition to being a developer and integrator 

of offshore energy and infrastructure assets, 

focusing on work with higher value capture. 

As Keppel executes the transformation of 

Keppel O&amp;M, it will also continue to explore 

inorganic options, though there is no 

assurance that any transaction will materialise.

Keppel has also decided to divest its 

logistics business in line with the more 

focused and disciplined approach towards 

capital allocation which it has committed 

to as part of Vision 2030, and is currently 

engaging potential buyers. The Company 

has also announced new initiatives in 

the development of onshore and offshore 

renewable energy assets, urban development 

and asset management among others.

Keppel sees sustainability as being core to 

its strategy, not just in terms of how it deals 

with ESG issues, but as a source of business 

opportunities, as it channels the Group’s 

capabilities and resources to meet the needs 

of sustainable development and address 

the challenges posed by climate change. 

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN 2020

GRI 201-1

The Group reported a net loss of  

$506 million for 2020, compared to a 

net profit of $707 million a year ago, after 

impairments of $952 million, mainly due to 

the offshore &amp; marine business. Excluding 

impairments in both years, the Group would 

have registered a net profit of $446 million 

for 2020, as compared to the net profit 

of $828 million for 2019. Apart from 

Keppel O&amp;M, all key business units of 

the Group remained profitable in 2020. 

Total cash dividend for 2020 is 10.0 cents 

per share. This comprises a final cash 

dividend of 7.0 cents per share as well as 

an interim cash dividend of 3.0 cents 

per share paid in the third quarter of 2020. 

Keppel Corporation Limited

GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE &amp; 

TAXES PAID 

GRI 201-4 

In 2020, the Group received a total of 

$155 million in financial assistance from 

governments. Approximately 96% of 

financial assistance received was from 

the government of Singapore, comprising 

mainly Jobs Support Scheme1 credits, 

property tax and levy rebates. The Group 

also received the Singapore government’s 

research and development grants, training 

grants as well as cash grants under 

its wage credit and employment credit 

schemes. The remaining 4% was from 

the governments of China and Australia. 

The Group has exposure to income 

taxes in many jurisdictions. Significant 

assumptions are required in determining 

the provision for income taxes. There are  

certain transactions and computations 

for which the ultimate tax determination 

is uncertain during the ordinary course 

of business. The Group recognises 

liabilities for expected tax issues based 

on estimates of whether additional 

taxes will be due. 

Where the final tax outcome of these 

matters is different from the amounts 

that were initially recognised, such 

differences will impact the income tax 

and deferred tax provisions in the period 

in which such determination is made. 

The carrying amounts of taxation and 

deferred taxation are disclosed in the 

balance sheet in Keppel Corporation’s 

Annual Report 2020. 

The Group operates in more than 

20 countries. In 2020, the Group 

contributed $177 million in taxes 

to the various countries and tax 

jurisdictions in which it operates. 

EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION 

In 2020, staff costs amounted to 

$1,120 million in the form of wages 

and salaries, employer’s contribution 

to Singapore’s Central Provident Fund, 

share options and share plans, as well 

as other staff benefits. The Group’s 

average number of employees in 2020 

was 18,4522.

1 The Jobs Support Scheme provides temporary wage 

support to employers to help them retain their local 

employees (Singapore Citizens and Permanent 

Residents) during this period of economic uncertainty. 

Payouts through the scheme are intended to offset 

local employees’ wages and help protect their jobs.

2 The figures in this section do not take into account 

the headcount and staff costs of associated 

companies, whereby an associated company is an 

entity over which the Keppel Group has significant 

influence but not control.

The CEO, assisted by the management 

team, makes strategic proposals to the 

Board and after robust and constructive 

board discussion, executes the agreed 

strategy, manages and develops the 

Group’s businesses and implements the 

Board’s decisions. He is supported by 

management committees that direct 

and guide management on operational 

policies and activities, which include: 

1. Investments &amp; Major Projects Action 

Committee (“IMPAC”), which guides the 

Group to exercise the spirit of enterprise 

as well as prudence to earn optimal risk 

adjusted returns on invested capital for 

its chosen lines of business, taking into 

consideration the relevant risks, in a 

controlled manner; 

2. Management Development Committee 

(“MDC”), which nominates candidates 

as nominee directors to the boards of 

each unlisted company or entity that 

the Company is invested in (“Investee 

Company”) so as to safeguard the

BOARD STRATEGIC REVIEW

The Board periodically reviews and 

approves the Group’s strategic plans.

A two-day off-site board strategy meeting is 

organised annually for in-depth discussion on 

strategic issues and the direction of the Group, 

to give the non-executive directors (NEDs) 

a better understanding of the Group and its 

business, and to provide an opportunity for 

the NEDs to familiarise themselves with the 

management team so as to facilitate the Board’s 

review of the Group’s succession planning 

and leadership development programme.

In FY 2020, the focus of the strategy 

meeting was on Vision 2030, a long-term 

roadmap to guide the Group’s strategy and 

transformation, which was announced via 

SGXNet in May 2020. From a conglomerate 

of diverse parts, the Company will refocus 

its portfolio to be an integrated business, 

providing end-to-end solutions for sustainable 

urbanisation, with sustainability placed at 

the core of its strategy. Building on the 

Group’s strengths in engineering, developing 

and operating specialised assets, as well 

as capital and asset management, the 

Company will focus on four key business 

areas, namely Energy &amp; Environment, 

Urban Development, Connectivity and 

Asset Management – all part of a connected 

value chain. As part of the Group’s sharpened 

business focus and asset-light model, 

the Company is also taking a disciplined 

approach to capital allocation, to deploy 

more capital to its growth platforms and 

unlock value from more integration and 

synergies within the Group, while continuing 

to recycle capital to enhance the Group’s 

overall return.

In September 2020, the Group embarked 

on further steps in the Vision 2030 

roadmap, including the strategic review 

of the offshore &amp; marine business, 

and a $3-5 billion asset monetisation 

programme over three years to free up 

the Group’s balance sheet to pursue 

new growth opportunities. To this end, 

a Transformation Office was established 

to drive the implementation of Vision 2030 

and create sustainable value for all 

stakeholders. The Transformation Office 

provides regular updates to the Board.

AN EFFECTIVE BOARD

GRI 102-25 | 102-27 | 102-28

The Board and management fully appreciate 

that fundamental to good corporate 

governance is an effective and robust 

Board whose members engage in open 

and constructive debate and challenge 

management on its assumptions 

and proposals.

INDEPENDENCE OF DIRECTORS

The NC determines on an annual basis 

whether or not a director is independent. 

In January 2021, the NC carried out the 

review on the independence of each 

director based on the respective directors’ 

self-declaration in the Directors’ Independence 

Checklist and their actual performance on 

the Board and board committees, taking into 

account the listing rules on the circumstances 

in which a director will not be deemed 

independent and guidance in the 2018 

CG Code as to the circumstances in 

which a director should not be deemed 

independent. The assessments of the 

independence of the directors are set out 

on page 83 of our Annual Report 2020. 

All board committees comprise majority 

non-executive and independent directors 

(including the Chairman).

INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT 

All directors are expected to exercise 

independent judgment in the best interests of 

the Company. This is one of the performance 

criteria for the peer assessment of the 

individual directors. Based on the result 

of the peer assessment carried out by the 

directors for FY 2020, all directors have 

discharged this duty well. 

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Each director must promptly disclose 

conflicts of interest, whether direct or 

indirect, in relation to any transaction or 

proposed transaction. In this connection, 

the Company has in place a “Keppel Group 

– Directors’ Conflict of Interest Policy” to 

guide directors in identifying, disclosing and 

managing situations of actual or potential 

conflicts, as well as situations which may be 

perceived to be conflicts of interest. Every 

director is required to promptly disclose 

any conflict of interest, whether direct or 

indirect, in relation to a transaction or 

proposed transaction with the Company 

as soon as is practicable after the relevant 

facts have come to his/her knowledge, and 

recuse himself/herself when the conflict-

related matter is discussed unless the Board 

is of the opinion that his/her presence and 

participation is necessary to enhance the 

efficacy of such discussion, and abstain 

from voting in relation to conflict-related 

matters. On an annual basis, each director 

is also required to submit details of his/her 

associates for the purpose of monitoring 

interested persons transactions. 

BOARD COMPETENCY &amp; DIVERSITY

The Company recognises that diversity in 

relation to composition of the Board provides 

a range of perspectives and insights needed 

to support good decision-making for the 

benefit of the Group, and is committed to 

ensuring that the Board comprises directors 

who, as a group, provide an appropriate 

balance and mix of skills, knowledge, 

experience, and other aspects of diversity 

(such as gender and age) so as to promote 

the inclusion of different perspectives 

and ideas, mitigate against groupthink 

and ensure that the Company has the 

opportunity to benefit from all available 

talent. In identifying suitable candidates for 

new appointments to the Board, the NC 

would ensure that female candidates were 

included for consideration. The final 

decision on the appointment of directors 

would be based on and driven by merits 

against the objective criteria set by the 

Board from time to time on the 

recommendation of the NC after having 

regards to the benefits of diversity and the 

needs of the Board.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

STRATEGIC PILLAR: RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS


The Company has in place a Board Diversity 

Policy that sets out the framework and approach 

for the Board to set its qualitative and 

measurable quantitative objectives for 

achieving diversity, and to annually assess 

the progress in achieving these objectives. 

The annual assessment is led by the NC as 

part of the process for appointment of new 

directors and Board succession planning. 

To help the NC identify gaps (if any) in skills, 

knowledge, experience and other aspects 

of diversity in the board composition in any 

given year of assessment, each member of 

the Board is required to complete a Board 

Diversity Matrix to indicate which of the list 

OBJECTIVES FOR FY 2020

Objectives

Progress

Appoint at least two additional 

independent directors with 

some of the core competencies 

already present on the Board, 

by end-FY 2020 for succession 

planning purposes.

Mr Tham Sai Choy was appointed as a non-executive and 

independent director with effect from 1 November 2019. 

Mr Tham was Managing Partner of KPMG Singapore and 

then Chairman of KPMG Asia Pacific before he retired in 

2017. He was a member of KPMG’s global board, and had 

served on its executive committee and risk committee, 

and chaired its compensation and nominations committee. 

As a member of the executive committee, Mr Tham was 

responsible for KPMG’s global strategies and planning, 

including developing the firm’s capabilities in cyber security, 

data analytics and digital transformation. Mr Tham also 

worked with many of Singapore’s listed companies in 

their audits and other consultancy work over his 36 years 

of practice. He was appointed as a board member with 

a view of being the successor to Mr Danny Teoh in the 

roles of Audit Committee Chairman and Board Risk 

Committee member.

Mrs Penny Goh was appointed as a non-executive and 

independent director with effect from 2 January 2020.  

Mrs  Goh was Co-Chairman and Senior Partner of Allen &amp; 

Gledhill LLP, where she had, for many years, headed the 

firm’s corporate real estate practice. She advises listed 

corporations, private equity property funds, sovereign  

wealth funds and real estate investment trusts, and has 

extensive experience in a broad range of corporate real 

estate transactions for commercial, industrial and logistics 

projects in Singapore and the Asia Pacific, involving 

investment, joint development and profit participation 

structures. Mrs Goh was appointed with a view to 

succeeding Mr Alvin Yeo as a board member with legal 

expertise and to enhance the gender diversity of the Board.

Broaden the skill set of directors 

on the Board by appointing at 

least one director with the relevant 

expertise and experience that would 

complement those already on the 

Board and which would help drive 

the Group’s strategy. 

Mr Teo Siong Seng was appointed as a non-executive and 

independent director with effect from 1 November 2019 

(and subsequently re-designated as non-executive and 

non-independent director with effect from 3 February 2021). 

His strong background, knowledge and experience in 

the China market, experience in growing businesses in 

frontier countries such as East and West Africa, and his 

knowledge and experience from serving as Chairman of 

the Singapore Business Federation, Honorary President of 

the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry 

and as director of Business China, would enhance the 

balance and breadth of skills of the Board, and help drive 

the Group’s strategy.

Improve gender diversity over 

a 3-year period by ensuring that  

at least 20% of the Board will 

comprise female directors by  

the end of FY 2021.

The female representation on the Board is currently 25%. 

OBJECTIVES IDENTIFIED UNDER BOARD DIVERSITY POLICY

The objectives identified in FY 2019 to be fulfilled by the end of FY 2021, and the progress 

towards achieving such objectives, are set out below:

of skills, knowledge, experience and other 

aspects of diversity (identified by the NC, 

and set out in the Board Diversity Matrix, as 

being able to contribute to the Company’s 

strategy and business) the board member 

possesses. The returns from the Board 

members are then consolidated into a single 

Board Diversity Matrix to highlight the 

Board’s current mix of skills, knowledge, 

experience and other aspects of diversity 

and gaps therein if any. The Board will, 

taking into consideration the recommendations 

of the NC, review and agree annually the 

qualitative and measurable quantitative 

objectives for achieving diversity on the Board.

The NC conducted an assessment in 

January 2021 and is satisfied that the 

Board and the board committees comprise 

directors who as a group provide an 

appropriate balance and mix of skills, 

knowledge, experience and other aspects 

of diversity. The NC is also satisfied that 

the directors, as a group, possess core 

competencies required for the Board 

and the board committees to be effective, 

taking into account the Company’s strategy 

and business.

Nevertheless, the NC noted the need  

for new appointment of directors for 

succession planning purposes, given 

the retirement of three non-executive 

and independent directors at the recent 

annual general meeting. There is currently 

one independent director who has served 

for more than nine years on the Board, 

and two more who would have served 

more than nine years in 2024. Taking into 

account feedback from the recent board 

assessment exercise, the NC was of 

the view that the Board could benefit 

from directors with strong knowledge, 

experience and expertise in (i) digital 

economy/technology, (ii) renewable  

energy, (iii) regional market experience, 

(iv) sustainability, (v) mergers and 

acquisitions and (vi) corporate finance. 

The Board, at the recommendation of 

the NC, had therefore set a new objective 

under the Board Diversity Policy, which was 

to appoint at least three to four additional 

independent directors by end-FY 2023, 

with relevant expertise and experience 

that would complement those already 

on the Board and which would help drive 

the Group’s Vision 2030 strategy, and 

for succession planning.

BOARD INFORMATION

To effectively engage the management, 

the Board must be kept well informed of the 

Company’s businesses and affairs, and be 

knowledgeable about the industry in which 

the businesses operate. The Company has 

therefore adopted initiatives to put in place

A training programme is also in place 

for directors in areas such as accounting, 

finance, corporate social responsibility, 

risk governance and management, the roles 

and responsibilities of a director of a listed 

company and industry specific matters. In 

FY 2020, some KCL directors attended talks 

on topics relating to the digital economy, 

macroeconomic trends, sustainable 

urbanisation, energy transition, innovation 

investments, and corporate governance. 

E-training was also conducted on the 

Group’s policies on anti-corruption, personal 

data protection, competition law and cyber 

security. Site visits are also conducted 

periodically to familiarise directors with the 

operations of the various business units so 

as to enhance their performance as board

Company’s expense.

processes to ensure that the NEDs are well 

supported by accurate, complete and timely 

information, have unrestricted access to 

management, and have sufficient time 

and resources to discharge their oversight 

function effectively. Subject to the approval 

of the Chairman, the directors, whether as 

a group or individually, may seek and obtain 

independent professional advice to assist 

them in their duties, at the expense of 

the Company.

As a general rule, board papers are required 

to be distributed to the directors at least 

seven days before the board meeting so 

that the members may better understand 

the matters prior to the board meeting 

and discussion may be focused on 

questions that the directors may have. 

Directors are provided with tablet devices 

to facilitate their access to and review of 

board materials. However, sensitive matters 

may be tabled at the meeting itself and 

discussed. Managers who can provide 

additional insights into the matters at hand 

would be present at the relevant time during 

the board meeting. The directors are also 

provided with the names and contact details 

of the Company’s senior management 

and the Company Secretaries to facilitate 

direct access.

Regular informal meetings are held 

for management to brief the directors 

on prospective deals and potential 

developments at an early stage before 

formal board approval is sought, and 

relevant information on business initiatives, 

industry developments and analyst and 

press commentaries on matters in relation 

to the Company or the industries in which it 

operates is circulated to the directors from 

time to time. Management is also expected 

to provide the Board with accurate information 

in a timely manner concerning the Company’s 

progress or shortcomings in meeting its 

strategic business objectives or financial 

targets and other information relevant  

to the strategic issues facing  

the Company.

The Board also reviews the budget on 

an annual basis, and any material variance 

between the projections and actual 

results would be disclosed and explained. 

Management also provides the Board 

members with management accounts 

on a monthly basis and as the Board 

may require from time to time, to keep 

the Board informed, on a balanced and 

understandable basis, of the Group’s 

performance, financial position 

and prospects.

TRAINING

Directors are provided with continuing 

education in areas such as directors’ duties 

and responsibilities, corporate governance, 

BOARD EVALUATION

The Board has implemented formal processes 

for assessing the effectiveness of the Board 

as a whole, each of its board committees, 

the contribution by the Chairman and peer 

and self-assessment of the individual 

directors to the effectiveness of the Board.

To ensure that the assessments are done 

promptly and fairly, the Board has appointed 

an independent third party (the “Independent 

Co-ordinator”) to assist in collating and 

analysing the returns of the board members. 

Mr Michael Lim, former Chairman of 

PricewaterhouseCoopers and Land 

Transport Authority, and currently Chairman 

of Nomura Singapore Limited, was appointed 

for this role. Mr Michael Lim does not have 

business relationships or any other connections 

with the Company or its directors which 

may affect his independent judgment.

Process for appointment of new directors 

Process for re-nomination of retiring directors

a. The NC reviews annually the balance and mix 

of skills, knowledge, experience, and other aspects 

of diversity such as gender and age, and the size of 

the Board which would facilitate decision-making. 

In this review, the NC would also take into account 

the needs of the Group, the collective skills and 

competencies of the Board and service tenure 

spread of the directors.

a. Pursuant to the Constitution, one-third 

of the directors shall retire from office at 

the Company’s annual general meeting 

every year, and a director appointed after 

the last annual general meeting shall 

only hold office until the next annual 

general meeting. If eligible, these directors 

may submit themselves for re-election.

b. In the light of such review and in consultation 

with management, the NC assesses if there is 

any inadequate representation in respect of any 

of those attributes and if so, determines the  

role and the desirable competencies for a 

particular appointment. 

b. The NC reviews each director’s 

eligibility, contribution and 

performance (such as attendance, 

preparedness, participation and 

candour), with reference to the results 

of the assessment of the performance 

of the individual director by his/her 

peers and his/her tenure.

c. The NC will, in all cases, take into consideration the 

following objective criteria identified as necessary 

for the Board and board committees to be effective:

i. Integrity

ii. Independent mindedness

iii. Ability to commit time and effort to carry out duties 

and responsibilities effectively 

iv. Track record of making good decisions

v. Experience in high-performing companies

vi. Financial literacy

c. NC makes recommendations to the 

Board for approval.

d. External help (for example, Singapore Institute of 

Directors and search consultants) may be used 

to source for potential candidates if need be.  

Directors and management may also make 

recommendations. 

e. The NC meets with the short-listed candidate(s) to 

assess suitability and to ensure that the candidate(s)  

is/are aware of the expectations and the level of 

commitment required.

f. The NC makes recommendations to the Board 

for approval.

KEPPEL’S SYSTEM OF MANAGEMENT 

CONTROLS FRAMEWORK

The Group also has in place Keppel’s 

System of Management Controls Framework 

(the “Framework”) outlining the Group’s internal 

control and risk management processes and 

procedures. The Framework comprises 

the Three-Lines Model towards ensuring 

the adequacy and effectiveness of the 

Group’s system of internal controls and 

risk management.

Under the First Line, management is required 

to ensure good corporate governance through 

the implementation and management of 

policies and procedures relevant to the Group’s 

business scope and environment. Such 

policies and procedures govern financial, 

operational (including IT) and regulatory 

compliance matters and are reviewed and 

updated periodically. Compliance governance 

is governed by the respective regulatory 

compliance management committees and 

working teams. Employees are also guided 

by the Group’s core values and expected to 

comply strictly with the Keppel Group Code 

of Conduct.

Under the Second Line, significant business 

units and entities scoped in for control self 

assessment (“CSA entities”) are required to 

conduct a self-assessment exercise on an 

annual basis (“CSA”). This exercise requires 

such business units and CSA entities to assess 

the status of their respective risk management 

processes and internal controls via 

self-assessment. Where required, action 

under review. In this regard, the Board 

has put in place a formal process for the 

renewal of the Board and the selection 

of new directors so that the experience of 

longer serving directors can be drawn upon 

while tapping into the new external perspectives 

and insights which more recent appointees 

bring to the Board’s deliberation. The NC leads 

the process and makes recommendation 

to the Board on the appointment of new 

director and re-nomination of directors.

REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK

GRI 102-35 | 102-36

The Remuneration Committee (RC) is 

responsible for ensuring a formal and 

transparent procedure for developing 

policy on executive remuneration and for 

determining the remuneration packages of 

individual directors and senior management. 

The RC assists the Board to ensure that 

remuneration policies and practices are 

sound in that they are able to attract, retain 

and motivate without being excessive, 

thereby maximising shareholder value. The 

remuneration framework is set out from 

pages 86 to 91 of our Annual Report 2020.

The RC has access to expert advice from 

external remuneration consultants where 

required. In FY 2020, the RC sought views 

from external remuneration consultants, 

Aon Hewitt, on market practice and trends, 

and benchmarks against comparable 

organisations. The RC undertook a review 

of the independence and objectivity of the 

external remuneration consultants through 

discussions with the external remuneration 

consultants, and has confirmed that the  

external remuneration consultants had no 

relationships with the Company which would 

affect their independence and objectivity.

RISK MANAGEMENT &amp; 

INTERNAL CONTROLS

GRI 102-17 | 102-33 | 205-2

The Board, supported by the Audit Committee 

(“AC”) and Board Risk Committee (“BRC”), 

oversees the Group’s system of internal 

controls and risk management.

The AC’s primary role is to assist the 

Board with ensuring the integrity of financial 

reporting and the adequacy and effectiveness 

of the system of internal controls and 

risk management. The AC has explicit 

authority to investigate any matter within 

its responsibilities, full access to and 

co-operation by management, full discretion 

to invite any director or executive officer 

to attend its meetings, and reasonable 

resources (including access to external 

consultants) to enable it to properly 

discharge its responsibilities. 

The BRC considers the nature and extent of 

the significant risks which the Company may 

take in achieving its strategic objectives 

and value creation; and reviews and guides 

management in the formulation of risk policies 

and processes to effectively identify, evaluate 

and manage significant risks, to safeguard 

shareholders’ interests, the Group’s assets 

and ensure corporate sustainability.

plans are developed to remedy identified 

control gaps. The CSA programme was 

enhanced in FY 2020 through the refresh 

of group baseline controls, optimisation of 

controls automation, continuous monitoring 

and digitisation of CSA. As described under 

the Group’s ERM Framework, relevant 

and material risk areas of the Group are 

also identified and assessed, with systems, 

policies and processes put in place to 

manage and mitigate identified risk areas 

should they exceed internal thresholds 

of appetite. It includes the reporting and 

oversight structure involving both boards 

and management of the Group and 

business divisions and seeks to embed 

sound risk management practice in business 

decisions and operations across Group 

entities. Regulatory Compliance supports 

and works alongside business management 

to ensure relevant policies, processes and 

controls are effectively designed, managed 

and implemented to ensure compliance 

risks and controls are effectively managed. 

The IT Governance Framework aims to 

strengthen IT controls and manage IT risks 

by providing the necessary security and 

resilience towards effective business 

continuity. The framework was further 

strengthened in January 2021 through the 

formalisation of a Keppel Cybersecurity 

governance structure and the establishment 

of a Keppel Cybersecurity Service Centre.

Under the Third Line, to assist the Group 

to ascertain the adequacy and effectiveness 

of the Group’s internal controls, business 

units’ CEOs and Chief Financial Officers 

are required to provide the Group with 

written assurances as to the adequacy 

and effectiveness of their system of internal 

controls and risk management. Such 

assurances are also sought from the 

Group’s internal and external auditors 

based on their independent assessments.

ENHANCEMENT TO COMPLIANCE 

PROGRAMME IN FY 2020 

As our Code of Conduct states, “we care 

how results are achieved, not just that they 

are attained.” Implementing this through 

enhancing our regulatory compliance process 

and by reminding every Keppelite of that 

value is a focus of attention for us, our 

boards, and officers and line managers 

across the globe. Read more about the 

Group’s enhanced compliance programme 

on pages 94 to 96 of our Annual Report 2020.

COMMUNICATION &amp; TRAINING 

The Group continuously ensures that its 

compliance policies and procedures are 

communicated effectively to all employees 

and directors. In 2020, an e-training and 

assessment exercise covering all key policies, 

including the Keppel Group Code of Conduct, 

Conflict of Interest, Whistle-Blowing, 

Anti-Bribery, was carried out. 17,051 directors 

and employees have completed the 

e-training and toolbox training. Targeted 

training focused on line managers’ 

responsibilities and employees’ obligations, 

under the K’ompass programme, was 

also conducted in FY 2020. The K’ompass 

training aims to educate and entrench 

correct mindsets, behaviours, and culture 

towards fostering risk awareness, ethical 

behaviour at work, importance of controls 



The Group continuously ensures that its compliance policies and procedures are communicated effectively to all 

employees and directors.

and focus on safety. Conflict of Interest 

training targeted at those with procurement, 

commercial, business development 

functions, were also conducted to heighten 

awareness of conflict situations and to 

train on declaration requirements. 

REPORTING &amp; INVESTIGATION

Keppel’s Whistle-Blower Policy took effect 

on 1 September 2004 and was enhanced 

on 15 February 2017 and 1 May 2019 

to encourage reporting in good faith of 

suspected reportable conduct by establishing 

clearly defined and centralised processes 

through which such reports may be made 

with confidence that employees and other 

persons making such reports will be treated 

fairly and, to the extent possible, protected 

from reprisal.

THE TONE FOR REGULATORY COMPLIANCE IS 

DRIVEN FROM THE TOP AND RESONATES WITH 

OUR EMPLOYEES AT EVERY LEVEL. WE REMAIN 

VIGILANT AND DETERMINED TO BUILD A 

DISCIPLINED AND SUSTAINABLE COMPANY. 

OVERVIEW

GRI 102-15

We are guided by our core values and 

code of conduct. We will do business 

the right way and comply with all applicable 

laws and regulations wherever we 

operate We strive to deliver outstanding 

performance, whilst maintaining the 

highest ethical standards.

We are clear with our tone for regulatory 

compliance, which is consistently emphasised 

from the top and throughout all levels 

of the Group. We do not tolerate fraud, 

bribery, corruption or any violation of laws 

and regulations.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

We have made significant progress in 

embedding a robust compliance framework 

and process throughout the Group. 

In addition to Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine 

obtaining ISO 37001 Anti-Bribery Management 

Systems certification for all units globally in 

2019, Keppel Land and Keppel Data Centres 

entities in Singapore have also attained 

ISO 37001 certification in 2020, attesting 

to our commitment in implementing the 

same standard throughout the Group. 

This will ensure consistency in application 

and operational effectiveness of the 

compliance programme. 

Our compliance framework is commensurate 

with the size, role and activity of each 

business unit (BU), with appropriate 

compliance control systems to effectively 

detect and remedy potential gaps. We 

are committed to forging a sustainable 

compliance framework that supports 

the Group’s growth and vision.

GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

Our Regulatory Compliance Governance 

Structure is designed to strengthen 

corporate governance. The Board Risk 

Committee (BRC) supports the Board in 

its oversight of regulatory compliance 

and is responsible for driving the Group’s 

implementation of compliance and 

governance systems. Group Risk &amp; 

Compliance serves as a secretariat to 

the BRC, assessing and reporting on 

compliance risks, controls and mitigation.

The Group Regulatory Compliance 

Management Committee (Group RCMC) 

is chaired by Keppel Corporation’s 

Chief Executive Officer and its members 

include all BU heads. The role of the 

Group RCMC is to articulate the Group’s 

commitment to regulatory compliance, as 

well as direct and support the development 

and implementation of over-arching 

compliance policies and guidelines.

The Group RCMC is supported by the 

Group Regulatory Compliance Working 

Team (Group RCWT), which is chaired 

by the Head of Group Risk &amp; Compliance. 

The Group RCWT oversees the development 

and review of pertinent regulatory 

compliance matters, over-arching 

compliance policies and guidelines for 

the Group, as well as reviews training 

and communication programmes.

Each BU has a dedicated Compliance Lead. 

He/she is supported by the respective risk 

and compliance teams and is responsible 

for driving and administering the compliance 

programme and agenda for the BU. This 

includes providing support to BU management 

with subject matter expertise, process 

excellence and regular reporting to ensure 

that compliance risks are effectively 

assessed, managed and mitigated. 

We continue to strengthen the Group’s 

Compliance teams with additional 

professional and experienced officers.

Under the direction of Group RCMC and 

Group RCWT, BUs are responsible for 

implementing the Keppel Group Code of 

Conduct and regulatory compliance policies 

and procedures. They are also responsible 

for ensuring that risk assessments of 

material regulatory compliance risks are 

conducted, and that control measures 

are practical, adequate and effective.

duties and responsibilities to the 

highest standards of business integrity. 

It covers areas from conduct in the 

workplace to business conduct, including 

clear provisions on prohibitions against 

bribery and corruption, and conflicts of 

interest amongst others. In the interest of 

clarity and transparency, the Code is publicly 

available on the Group’s and BUs’ websites. 

We continue to review and enhance the 

Code to ensure that it stays updated and 

properly instructive. Appropriate disciplinary 

action, including suspension/termination 

of employment, is taken if an employee is 

found to have violated the Code.

We have procedures to ensure that 

disciplinary actions are carried out 

consistently and fairly across all levels 

of employees. All third parties who 

represent Keppel in business dealings, 

including joint venture (JV) partners, 

are also required to comply with and 

follow the requirements of the Code. 

SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT

The acknowledgement to abide by the 

Keppel Supplier Code of Conduct is mandatory 

for all key suppliers across the Group. 

The areas covered within the supplier code 

of conduct include proper business conduct, 

human rights, fair labour practices, stringent 

safety and health standards and responsible 

environmental management.

WHISTLE-BLOWER POLICY

Keppel’s Whistle-Blower Policy encourages 

the reporting of suspected bribery, violations 

or misconduct through a clearly-defined 

process and reporting channel, by which 

reports can be made in confidence and 

without fear of reprisal. The whistle-blower 

reporting channels are widely communicated 

and made accessible to all.

PERSONAL DATA PRIVACY ACT (PDPA)

Guidance is provided to employees on 

the Personal Data Protection Commission’s 

advisory guidelines to ensure that the 

Group complies with the requirements 

of the PDPA. Further to the amendments 

announced in November 2020, the Group’s 

guidelines will be updated accordingly.

COMPLIANCE POLICIES

We maintain a comprehensive list of policies 

covering compliance-related matters 

including anti-bribery, gifts and hospitality, 

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE 

FRAMEWORK

Our regulatory compliance framework 

focuses on critical pillars covering 

the areas of culture; policies and 

procedures; training and communication; 

key compliance processes; compliance 

risk assessment, reviews and monitoring, 

and compliance resources.

A key aspect of the framework is the 

structure of the compliance organisation. 

The Head of Group Risk &amp; Compliance 

reports directly to the Chairman of the 

BRC. Similarly, the Compliance Leads of 

the BUs have direct reporting lines to the 

respective BU Audit and Risk Committees. 

Furthermore, BU Compliance Leads 

report directly to the Head of Group Risk &amp; 

Compliance. This reporting structure 

reinforces independence of the function 

and enables management and the Board 

to provide continuous, clear and explicit 

support, and credence to the Group’s 

compliance programme.

CULTURE

Culture and mindset are critical in ensuring 

effectiveness and durability of our compliance 

programme. Management has a key role in 

setting the right tone and walking the talk. 

This helps to embed a strong and robust 

regulatory compliance programme and 

culture that permeates all levels.

Posters on anti-bribery, anti-corruption 

and reporting mechanisms are displayed 

in our offices globally and we issue 

Group-wide bulletins on relevant topical 

issues to apprise, inform and reinforce 

compliance principles and messages. 

Key tone from the top messages are 

also delivered periodically by BU heads 

to employees. Compliance moments 

were introduced as part of the agenda at 

meetings, where pertinent compliance 

topics and learnings are shared. We 

continue to work on initiatives to foster 

a positive compliance-centric culture.

POLICIES &amp; PROCEDURES

GRI 102-16 | 102-17

EMPLOYEE CODE OF CONDUCT

We have a strict Code of Conduct (Code) 

that applies to all employees, who are 

required to acknowledge and comply 

with the Code. 

The Code sets out important principles 

to guide employees in executing their 

Keppel Corporation Limited  

49


agent fees, donations and sponsorships, 

solicitation and extortion, conflict of interest 

and insider trading, amongst others. 

These policies are reviewed periodically 

to ensure that they are commensurate 

with the activities and business plans in the 

jurisdictions in which the Group operates. 

Group policies are applicable to all BUs 

and unless the jurisdictional regulatory 

requirements are more stringent, these 

policies represent the minimum standards 

for the Group. Concerted efforts are taken 

to ensure all compliance policies, including 

translated versions, are made available 

and accessible to employees.

In 2020, we developed a Group Sanctions 

Compliance policy and BU-specific 

sanctions programme, building on our 

current Regulatory Compliance programme 

and controls. We are now even better 

able to monitor updates on sanctions 

requirements and guide respective BUs in 

navigating through increasingly complex 

sanctions and export control laws. 

TRAINING &amp; COMMUNICATIONS

Training is an essential component of 

Keppel’s regulatory compliance framework. 

Our programmes are tailored to specific 

audiences and we leverage Group-wide 

forums to reiterate key messages.

We have a comprehensive annual e-learning 

training programme which is mandatory 

for directors, officers and employees. 

The content of the training covers 

the Keppel Group Code of Conduct and 

key principles underlying our compliance 

policies. Directors, officers and employees 

are required to undergo assessments 

to successfully complete the training. 

In addition, directors, officers and 

employees are also required to formally 

acknowledge their understanding of 

policies and declare any potential or 

actual conflicts of interest. Training on 

anti-bribery and the Keppel Group Code 

of Conduct was also carried out in multiple 

languages for industrial/general workers. 

In 2020, e-training outlining the principles 

underpinning the Group’s policies and 

key areas to note when representing 

or acting on Keppel’s behalf were 

rolled out for high-risk third-party 

associates (TPA). 

We continue to refine our compliance 

training programmes and curriculum. 

We are also focused on developing 

and tailoring training content to varying 

targe groups and training needs. Such 

training conducted in 2020 included 

conflict of interest and sanction  

compliance webinars. 

In addition to policy-related training 

programmes, we conduct training focused 

on the line managers’ responsibilities 

in developing the desired culture and 

mindsets regarding compliance. These 

responsibilities include the need to establish 

and maintain effective internal controls to 

ensure that processes are robust, and that 

potential gaps are identified and mitigated 

in a timely manner.

Our training aims to engender positive 

compliance mindsets and culture, and we see 

this guiding our employees in critical facets 

of their work. Training focused on building 

risk and compliance competencies are also 

organised to ensure that we are apprised 

on changes in approaches, best practices 

and tools.

We also leverage opportunities at various 

management conferences and employee 

meetings to emphasise the importance 

of compliance.

To drive greater compliance awareness 

and knowledge throughout the Group, 

we issued a quarterly news bulletin on 

compliance, risk and control matters. 

We also introduced a quiz element which 

garnered positive feedback and responses 

across BUs, in part demonstrating a 

heightened awareness and understanding 

of ethics and compliance considerations 

amongst employees. 

KEY PROCESSES

DUE DILIGENCE 

We continue to improve our risk-based 

due diligence process for all TPAs 

who represent the Group in business 

dealings, including our JV partners, 

to assess the compliance risk of 

the business partner. In addition to 

background checks, the due diligence 

process incorporates requirements for 

TPAs to acknowledge understanding 

and compliance with the Keppel Group 

Code of Conduct.

OTHER PROCESSES 

As part of our ongoing review of policies 

and procedures, we ensure compliance 

oversight is embedded in key processes 

including areas such as gifts and hospitality, 

agent fees, donations and sponsorships, 

as well as conflicts of interest. We also 

actively seek opportunities for digitisation 

and explore the use of data analytics to 

enhance value and ensure efficiency of 

our compliance processes.

RISK ASSESSMENT, 

REVIEW &amp; MONITORING

We continually develop our compliance 

resources and framework. This will 

enable the Compliance team to conduct 

independent risk assessments to 

identify and mitigate key compliance 

risks. Regular discussions are held with 

all BUs, focusing on risk assessments 

including specific compliance risks 

identified for each BU. Separately, 

independent reviews of compliance risks 

are executed within the scope of internal 

audits, including thematic reviews of 

the effectiveness of key aspects of 

our compliance programmes. These 

reviews provide valuable insights 

and opportunities for us to improve 

our processes and programmes. 

ISO 37001 processes also assist in 

risk assessment exercises, providing 

even more systematic coverage 

and evaluations.

RESOURCES

We recognise the need for an experienced 

compliance team to effectively support 

compliance advisory, as well as to 

ensure that compliance programmes 

and controls are effectively implemented. 

The Board and management are committed 

to ensuring that we sustain a strong 

compliance function.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

STRATEGIC PILLAR: RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS


2. No risk arising from a single area of 

operation, investment or undertaking 

should be so huge as to endanger the 

entire Group; and 

3. The Group does not condone safety 

breaches or lapses, non-compliance 

with laws and regulations, as well as 

acts such as fraud, bribery and corruption.

Keppel’s risk governance framework, set out 

on pages 92 to 96 of our Annual Report 

under Principle 9 (Risk Management and 

Internal Controls), allows management and 

the Board to determine the adequacy and 

effectiveness of the Group’s risk 

management system.

As a group, we are cognisant of the dynamic 

environment in which we operate. We 

constantly enhance the framework and 

systems where necessary, to ensure risk 

management remains an integral part of 

decision-making and operations.

Keppel’s ERM framework, a component of 

Keppel’s System of Management Controls, 

provides the Group with a systematic 

approach to identify and manage risks. 

It outlines the requirement for each business 

unit (BU) to recognise key risk areas 

affecting its operations and to classify the 

impact and likelihood of these risks in a 

register for prioritisation and management. 

The ERM framework also provides the 

reporting structure, monitoring mechanisms, 

processes and tools used, as well as any 

policies, standards or limits to be applied in 

managing some of the Group’s key risk areas. 

RISK MANAGEMENT

GRI 102-11 | 102-15 | 103-1 | 103-2 | 103-3

Keppel adopts a balanced approach to 

risk management to optimise business 

returns while considering their holistic 

impact on corporate sustainability. 

Managing risk is integral to how we develop 

and execute our business strategies.  

It is grounded in our operating principles 

and belief that a balanced and holistic 

risk-reward methodology is key to 

our commitment to environmental, 

social and governance (ESG) issues, 

and to delivering long-term value for 

our stakeholders.

Our risk-centric culture and Enterprise 

Risk Management (ERM) Framework 

enable the Group to respond to the 

dynamic business environment and 

shifting business demands, and to 

seize new value-added opportunities.

RISK-CENTRIC CULTURE

Mindsets and attitudes are key to 

effective risk management. The Group 

fosters a risk-centric culture through 

several aspects. 

WE UNDERTAKE ONLY APPROPRIATE AND 

WELL-CONSIDERED RISKS, CONSIDERING THEIR 

IMPACT TO OUR BUSINESS, STAKEHOLDERS, 

AND LONG-TERM CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY. 

ENTERPRISE RISK 

MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK 

GRI 102-15 | 102-29 | 102-30 | 102-31 | 102-32

Relevant and material risk issues are 

surfaced for discussion with the Board 

Risk Committee (BRC) and the Board to 

keep them apprised in a timely manner. 

Through the BRC, the Board advises 

management in formulating and 

implementing the risk management 

framework, policies and guidelines.

The terms of reference for the BRC are 

disclosed on pages 99 and 100 of our 

Annual Report. The Board has defined 

three risk tolerance guiding principles for 

the Group which determine the nature and 

extent of the significant risks which the 

Board is willing to take to achieve 

business goals.

These principles are:

1. Risk taken should be carefully 

evaluated, commensurate with 

rewards and be in line with the 

Group’s core strengths and 

strategic objectives; 

PROCESS &amp; METHODS

An integral aspect of 

strategic and operational 

decision-making includes 

considering and managing 

risks at all levels of business. 

A key part of the process 

is the identification and 

assessment of risks using 

the five-step method: 

(1) identifying;  

(2) assessing;  

(3) mitigating;  

(4) communicating; and  

(5) monitoring. 

Underlying the five-step 

method is a detailed risk 

definition and reporting 

framework for risk oversight 

by Board and management.

TRANSPARENCY &amp; 

COMPETENCY 

We promote transparency 

in information sharing 

and escalation of 

risk-related matters, 

incidents, near-misses 

or events of interest. 

Risk identification 

and assessment are 

embedded in key control 

processes and Group-

wide surveys are 

conducted periodically to 

assess risk awareness 

amongst employees.

TRAINING &amp; COMMUNICATIONS

Training and communications support 

competency across all employees and 

occur through various forums, in-house 

publications and sharing of lessons learnt. 

Risk management is regularly reinforced 

as a discipline and developed through 

awareness and practice.

FRAMEWORK &amp; VALUES

We are guided by the 

ERM framework, as well as 

Keppel’s core values, 

vision and mission, 

in managing risks.

LEADERSHIP &amp; GOVERNANCE 

Keppel’s Board and management are 

fully committed to fostering a strong 

risk-centric culture and consistently 

partakes in reviewing risks in all areas 

of business. Key messages encouraging 

prudent risk-taking in decision-making 

and business processes are interwoven 

into major meetings, and decision-making 

to enable optimal risk management.

RISK-CENTRIC CULTURE

OWNERSHIP &amp; 

ACCOUNTABILITY

We advocate ownership and 

accountability of risks across all 

employees via the performance 

evaluation process. 

This is evident in our risk 

processes which emphasise 

having clear owners for major 

risk areas.

risk practices taking reference from 

the latest industry developments and 

best practices.

2020 was a transformative year for 

Keppel. This was not only due to 

the impact of COVID-19, but also the 

launch of Vision 2030, which defines 

our roadmap into the next decade.

The key risks identified for FY 2020 

on pages 53 to 55 of this report, 

encapsulate mainly our existing 

businesses and the transformation 

we have chosen to undertake. We 

remain committed to addressing 

each issue as they arise, in line with 

our philosophy of undertaking only 

appropriate and well-considered 

risks to optimise returns in a balanced 

and holistic manner, to deliver long-term 

value for all our stakeholders.

PROACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF 

RISKS &amp; OPPORTUNITIES

Effective risk management is a 

dynamic approach and encompasses the 

evaluation of both risks and opportunities. 

Managing risk is an inherent part of seizing 

opportunities. Hence, we do not fear 

risks but recognise the need to proactively 

manage them as part and parcel of 

business operations. The marrying of 

risks and opportunities allows us to 

take a business-centric approach to 

risk management, aligning business 

activities with risk considerations, 

and discussing issues in an open and 

transparent manner, enabling us to 

pursue optimal risk-return initiatives.

We continually evolve our framework 

and processes to ensure effectiveness 

and relevance. Much of these depend 

on our ability to remain connected and 

vigilant to emerging risks or opportunities. 

Across the Group, we identify and review 

these in various meetings throughout the 

year. Where applicable, these are further 

developed and discussed at various 

governance committees to determine 

action or response. We recognise that 

our systems and processes provide 

reasonable but not absolute assurance, 

and hence continually improve them 

to ensure that our ability to manage 

and respond to risks and opportunities 

remains relevant and effective.

Our ERM framework is also constantly 

refined to ensure it remains relevant in our 

operating environment and where required, 

is tailored to the requirements of each BU. 

The framework takes reference from the 

Singapore Code of Corporate Governance, 

the COSO Enterprise Risk Management – 

Integrated Framework, ISO 22301:2012, 

ISO 31000 and the Guidebook for 

Board Risk Committees.

Both management and risk leads across 

BUs drive and coordinate Group-wide 

activities and initiatives. These are 

facilitated by regular meetings to 

ensure that pertinent risks are identified, 

assessed and mitigated in a timely 

manner. Beyond operational activities, 

we continually improve on our

STRATEGIC RISKS

Market &amp; 

Competition

A large part of the Group’s strategic 

risks include market-driven forces, 

evolving competitive landscapes, 

changing customer demands and

disruptive innovation. The Group remains 

vulnerable to other external factors 

including volatility in the global economy, 

implications of geopolitical developments, 

intense competition in core markets and 

disruptive technology. The COVID-19 

pandemic, for example, impacted the 

Group’s operations in nearly all our 

key markets. 

Despite the many COVID-19 challenges faced by our businesses, including difficult 

economic and market conditions, mandated office closures and travel restrictions, 

the Group continued to operate resiliently, and remained focused on reviewing our 

business strategies, as well as formulating responses and taking pre-emptive 

actions against emerging risks. 

During the year, we launched Vision 2030 and established the Transformation 

Office to drive and coordinate Vision 2030-related activities. As the Group 

transforms, risk management policies and principles will be continually refined 

to support our business objectives.

Strategic Ventures,

Investments &amp; 

Divestments

We have an established process for 

evaluating investment and divestment 

decisions including strategic ventures. 

We ensure that these endeavours are 

well monitored and aligned with the 

Group’s strategic intent, investment 

objectives and desired returns. Where 

required, we may recalibrate some 

strategies in response to the changing 

business environment.

Together with the Board, the Investment and Major Project Action Committee 

guides the Group to ensure that risks taken are considered and controlled in 

a manner that exercises the spirit of enterprise and prudence to earn the best 

risk-adjusted returns on invested capital across our businesses. 

The evaluation of risks for strategic ventures involves rigorous due diligence, 

feasibility studies and sensitivity analyses of key assumptions and variables. 

Critical factors considered include alignment with the Group’s strategy, financial 

viability, country-specific political and regulatory developments, contractual risk 

implications, as well as previous lessons learnt. 

The Group’s investment portfolios are constantly monitored to ensure that performance 

is on track to meet our strategic intent and returns. In 2020, we also introduced 

shadow carbon pricing in the evaluation of major investment decisions. 

Sustainability and 

Climate Change

Sustainability covers a broad range 

of issues, many of which have been 

identified and managed according to the 

Group’s ERM framework. In particular, 

risks and opportunities relating to 

sustainability, climate change and the 

environment are fundamental to the 

Group. These relate to both physical 

and transitional risks. 

We support the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and have 

started incorporating its recommendations in our reporting framework. 

As part of Vision 2030, we place sustainability at the core of our strategy. 

The Group’s Sustainability Risk Management Framework is integrated with 

our ERM framework (Figure 1) and guides Group companies on the specific 

processes and methods applied in identifying, assessing and managing 

sustainability-related risks and opportunities. This includes third-party risks from 

vendors and suppliers. As part of Sustainability Risk Management, we assess 

opportunities for the Group in its sustainability strategy and are committed to 

strengthening our organisational capabilities in responding to climate-related 

risks and opportunities. We are also conducting an assessment of the vulnerability 

of the Group’s key assets to physical climate-related risks.

Customer &amp; 

Stakeholder 

Experience

The Group operates in many geographies 

and has multiple customer touchpoints, 

including retail consumers in the 

telecommunications, electricity, 

e-commerce and gas businesses. 

Beyond customers, other stakeholders 

include regulators, partners, investors, 

employees and the local communities 

in which we operate. We place utmost 

importance on Customer and Stakeholder 

Experience as such matters have direct 

bearing on trust and brand reputation. 

We consistently monitor our products and services for safety, quality and reliability. 

We respect customer/stakeholder feedback and post-sales support; and are 

committed to uphold personal data privacy, product safety and related matters 

including our responsiveness to inputs from stakeholders across various 

engagement channels.

Human Resources

We continue to maintain a strong 

emphasis on attracting and developing 

a wide pool of talent. To ensure we have  

the  necessary skillsets to enable Keppel’s 

transition into its next phase of growth, 

we have considered both internal and 

external development programmes. 

This includes nurturing employees, 

maintaining good industrial relations and 

fostering a conducive work environment. 

We are committed to strengthening 

succession planning and bench strength,  

as  well as building or acquiring new 

organisational capabilities to drive  

business  growth, whilst maintaining 

our status as an employer of choice. 

In our talent development programmes, we emphasise the importance of 

having a risk-centric mindset to inculcate the ability to identify and assess risks, 

develop and implement mitigating actions, and monitor residual risks.  

The Keppel Leadership Institute helps to inculcate this mindset by embedding 

risk management in its key leadership courses.

management. The Group adopts a 

systematic assessment and monitoring 

process to help manage key risks in 

projects. Attention is given to technically 

challenging and high-value projects, 

including greenfield developments and  

the deployment of new technology and/or 

operations in new geographies. Safety 

is incorporated into the design stage 

of projects to enhance worker safety. 

Projects are managed in accordance with 

the respective country’s environmental 

laws and labour practices.

During project execution, we conduct project reviews and quality assurance 

programmes to address issues involving cost, schedule and quality. Project 

Key Risk Indicators are used as early warning signals to determine if remedial 

actions are required. A Project Operational Set-up Guide detailing the key risk 

areas is available for BUs looking to implement large projects. We also conduct 

knowledge-sharing workshops to share best practices and lessons learnt 

across the Group.

These processes help to keep project delivery on time and within budget, without 

compromising on safety, quality, regulatory and contractual obligations.

Health, Safety &amp; 

Environment

We uphold high standards of safety, and 

this translates into constant vigilance to 

foster a strong HSE-centric culture across 

the Group, particularly at the ground level 

where the risks are greatest. 

With the outbreak of COVID-19, the Group has placed high emphasis on staff 

health by ensuring that measures are taken and government regulations properly 

followed, so as to protect employees from potential exposure. Efforts have been 

made across BUs to manage staff movement and ensure relevant precautions, 

such as the use of personal protective equipment and temperature screening.

Key HSE initiatives include our Zero Fatality Strategy with a roadmap focused  

on aligning Hazard Identification Risk Assessment standards across our global 

operations, enhancing competency of employees performing safety-critical tasks, 

strengthening operational controls, deploying Root Cause Analysis investigation 

standards across the Group, as well as developing more proactive and leading 

risk indicators/matrices to monitor HSE performance standards.

Environmental management is also a major area of focus and key operating sites 

are closely monitored for compliance with environmental standards.

In 2020, the Group clinched 21 awards at the Workplace Safety and Health  

(WSH) Awards for exemplary safety performance, implementation of strong  

WSH management systems and efforts to create solutions that improve 

workplace safety.

Business &amp; 

Operational 

Processes

The Group is connected by common 

shared services and platforms which 

enable us to better manage our processes 

and costs while enhancing efficiency, 

productivity, compliance and controls. 

We have adopted ISO standards and certifications in major business areas to 

standardise processes and keep up with industry best practices. In addition, 

procedures relating to defect management, operations, project control and supply 

chain management continue to be refined to improve the quality of deliverables. 

We continue to embark on digitalisation and automation to optimise our 

processes while taking a risk-based approach. We also continually evaluate 

procedures, policies and authority limits to ensure that they remain relevant 

in meeting business needs.

Business Continuity

We are committed to maintaining 

operational resilience with Business 

Continuity Management (BCM)  

standards that equip us with the capability 

to respond effectively to business 

disruptions. We are cognisant of major 

risks of natural disasters, fire, pandemics, 

terrorism and cyber-attacks as well as the 

failure of critical equipment/systems and 

industrial accidents. On major incidents, 

the Group Incident Reporting and Crisis 

Management operating standard guides 

us in management and response, while 

our Business Continuity Plans address 

post-event mitigation. These are 

coordinated by management and the 

Group BCM Steering Committee, 

which provide sponsorship, direction 

and guidance to ensure a constant 

readiness-to-respond state. We 

continually extend and strengthen our 

capabilities in responding to major 

incidents/crises with the aim of 

safeguarding our people, assets, 

stakeholders’ interests and the  

Company’s reputation.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the activation of Group-wide 

business continuity plans to protect employees and other stakeholders, 

whilst maintaining key operations. A COVID-19 Taskforce, comprising key 

senior management across the Group, was formed to coordinate centralised 

and timely responses, as well as review scenarios to ensure stability of the 

Group’s operations and supply chains. The Group is focused on the well-being of 

staff and stakeholders, ensuring that safe management measures are in place  

across facilities.

We also recognise cyber threat as an emerging area of potential business 

disruption and maintain a Group Cyber Incident Response plan, which references 

local and international standards, and details our response and recovery 

protocols. Table-top exercises are also planned to validate the effectiveness 

of these protocols.

We continue to monitor key disruptive threats to our business operations and 

adapt our plans to ensure operational resilience.

OPERATIONAL RISKS

Cyber Security &amp; 

Data Protection

GRI 418-1

As technology increasingly dominates 

business activities, we recognise the 

importance of cyber threats globally. 

Technology and data security risks, 

including outsourced services, are an 

integral part of the Group’s business risk. 

We have established a technology governance structure and risk framework to 

address both general technology and data security controls, covering key areas such 

as cyber security, business disruption, theft/loss of confidential data and data integrity. 

The Group continued to implement the Technology and Data Risk Management 

Programme in 2020. This involves the identification, assessment and management 

of critical technology and data assets according to leading industry guidelines such as 

those by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) and the US National Institute of 

Standards and Technology. The programme not only seeks to improve technology and 

data security standards but also to inculcate a culture of cyber awareness amongst employees.

In 2020, the Group also embarked on various initiatives to continually strengthen our 

technology security, governance and controls through the refinement and alignment of 

our policies, processes and systems, as well as the consolidation of servers and 

storage. We worked closely with industry professionals to define a cyber security 

governance structure and enhance our information technology policies and practices 

to ensure alignment with industry standards. Extensive training and assessment 

exercises were conducted during the year to heighten overall awareness of 

technology and data threats. These include the safeguarding of critical corporate 

data assets against the loss of availability of critical systems to disruptions.

In terms of use of technology, technical teams and experts from across the  

Group enable us to keep abreast of evolving technology. The response is either 

calibrated at each BU or managed strategically at the Group with the assistance 

of Keppel Technology &amp; Innovation, which drives Group-wide adoption of new 

technology and innovation. The Keppel Technology Advisory Panel, comprising 

leading academics, researchers and advisors from a wide range of related  

industries, also regularly advises the Group in areas of technological innovation.

COMPLIANCE RISKS

Laws, Regulations  

&amp; Compliance

GRI 205-1

Given the geographical diversity of 

our businesses, we closely monitor 

developments in relevant laws and 

regulations of countries where the 

Group operates to ensure compliance.  

We  regularly keep updated on changes  

to  laws and regulations, ensuring  

that we can assess our exposure 

and risks effectively, recognising 

that non-compliance with laws and  

regulations may have a detrimental  

effect on both the financial performance 

and reputation of Keppel.

Significant risk areas, such as those relating to potential corruption, are surfaced by 

management and where applicable, assessed by the Board. 

We are committed to enhancing our regulatory compliance policies and procedures 

to ensure that the Group maintains a high level of compliance and ethical standards 

in the way we conduct our business. Our emphasis is clear and consistently emphasised. 

We have zero tolerance for fraud, bribery, corruption and violation of laws and regulations.

In 2020, we continued to make improvements to our regulatory compliance programme, 

refining our processes, broadening employee understanding, and ensuring that 

compliance awareness and principles are entrenched in all activities. We also recognise 

the importance of sanctions risks owing to the escalation of trade and other sanctions 

in many countries. More details can be found on pages 48 to 50 of this report.

FINANCIAL RISKS

Fraud, 

Misstatement 

of Financial 

Statements &amp; 

Disclosures

We maintain a strong emphasis on 

ensuring that financial statements 

are accurate and presented fairly in 

accordance with applicable financial 

reporting standards and frameworks. 

Regular external and internal audits are conducted to provide assurance on the 

accuracy of financial statements and adequacy of the internal control framework 

supporting the statements. Where required, we leverage the expertise of the auditors 

we have engaged in the interpretation of financial reporting standards and changes. 

We also conduct regular training and education programmes to enhance the 

capabilities of the Group’s finance managers.

In 2020, we enhanced our internal control framework to support a more data-driven 

approach to control assessments. Deployment of the eCSA tool allowed all covered 

BUs to better review and report key control assessments and assurance activities, 

improving accuracy and transparency in the annual assurance process.

Keppel’s System of Management Controls framework outlines our internal control 

and risk management processes and procedures. For more details, please refer to 

pages 46 and 47 of this report.

Financial 

Management

Financial risk management relates to our 

ability to meet financial obligations and 

mitigate credit, liquidity, currency and interest 

rate risks. Details can be found on page 69 

of the Company’s Annual Report 2020. In this 

area, policies and financial authority limits are 

reviewed regularly to incorporate changes in 

the operating and control environment. 

We are focused on financial discipline and seek 

to deploy our capital to optimise risk-adjusted 

returns for shareholders, while maintaining a 

strong balance sheet to seize new opportunities. 

In 2020, as global economies faced stresses from the economic impact of COVID-19, 

the Group maintained a proactive approach to liquidity management and averted 

short-term funding stresses that were affecting many organisations across markets. 

Our procedures include the evaluation of counterparties and other related risks 

against pre-established internal guidelines. We conduct impact assessments and 

stress tests to gauge the Group’s potential financial exposure to changing market 

situations, to enable informed decision-making and the implementation of prompt 

mitigating actions. We also regularly monitor our asset concentration exposure in 

countries where we operate, to ensure that our portfolio of assets, investments and 

businesses are diversified against the systemic risks of operating in a specific geography.

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN

GRI 102-9 | 102-10

Division 

Description

Energy &amp; Environment

Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine (Keppel O&amp;M) works closely with subcontractors to construct, convert and repair 

offshore energy and infrastructure assets and marine vessels in our yards. Equipment manufacturers 

supply large-scale equipment such as thrusters, engines, winches, switchgear and variable control systems,  

as  well as specialised purpose-specific equipment such as cryogenic systems and offshore drilling equipment, 

for installation on the offshore and marine vessels Keppel O&amp;M constructs for clients. We also procure 

shipyard-specific equipment such as cranes, forklifts, transporters and panel line systems. Bulk material 

suppliers supply us with steel plates, steel profiles, cables, piping and paint; and consumables such as fuel, 

grits and gases.

Keppel Infrastructure engages consultants, system integrators, equipment manufacturers and suppliers, and 

subcontractors for the construction of plants and facilities and for the provision of environmental technology 

solutions. We also purchase raw materials, such as feedstock, to power the co-generation plant for our 

Energy Infrastructure business. In addition, we procure goods and services for the operations and maintenance 

of the plants and facilities.

Urban Development

Keppel Land engages consultants, contractors, and interior design firms to provide architectural and engineering 

design, construction and interior design services for our real estate developments. As a manager of real estate 

properties, we also employ facility management companies to service our commercial buildings.

Connectivity

Keppel Data Centres engages external contractors for the construction of new data centre facilities, and 

employs facility technician companies for regular equipment maintenance. 

Keppel Logistics engages contractors for transportation services, warehouse operations and facility 

maintenance. UrbanFox, our e-commerce logistics arm, engages crowdsourced drivers for last-mile delivery 

services through its online platform. 

M1 engages suppliers to support its supply of telecom equipment and services, terminals and devices, 

ICT solutions, software and computer hardware products, as well as cable installation. 88% of these suppliers 

are based in Singapore, in line with M1’s primary market.

Asset Management

Keppel’s asset managers engage subcontractors to ensure smooth operations and maintenance of the assets 

owned by the REITs and Trust. The supply chain for this business also includes mechanical and electrical 

equipment suppliers for some of our data centres, as well as property and facility management companies 

that provide building management, physical security, technical maintenance and routine cleaning services.

We are also progressively enhancing 

our identification and monitoring of the 

Scope 3 emissions generated by our 

supply chain.

SCREENING NEW SUPPLIERS

All suppliers are qualified in accordance 

with our requisition and purchasing policies, 

and screened based on ESG criteria. 

We review potential suppliers’ industry 

reputation, track record, financial performance, 

security practices and certifications, with a 

preference for suppliers with certifications 

for ISO 9001 Quality Management System, 

ISO 14001 Environmental Management 

System, and OHSAS 18001 Occupational 

Health and Safety assessment series or  

Keppel Corporation Limited  

57


ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety 

Management System or the equivalent.

All new suppliers that provide Keppel with 

products and services valued at $200,000 

or more per contract or over cumulative 

purchase orders in the prior calendar year 

are expected to sign and abide by the 

Keppel Supplier Code of Conduct, which 

covers areas pertaining to business conduct, 

labour practices, safety and health, and 

environmental management. All Group 

companies are required to include the code, 

which is available in multiple languages, as 

part of their supplier selection procedure. 

The supplier code of conduct is available 

on Keppel Corporation’s website. In 2020, 

100% of qualified suppliers endorsed the 

code or have their own codes which met 

Keppel’s requirements. 

Third-party associates of the Group that 

provide services on behalf of a Group 

company or engage in business activities 

on behalf of a Group company are required 

to abide by Keppel’s rules of business 

conduct. The rules specify the Group’s 

policy regarding ethical conduct and 

compliance with laws, anti-corruption, 

gifts and hospitality, and donations 

and contributions.

The Group completed the implementation of 

its enterprise resource system enhancement 

initiative in 2020. The enhanced system 

provides procurement managers across the 

Group with visibility on suppliers that have 

been qualified by other business units. 

In 2019, the Group established an ESG 

scorecard to consolidate key ESG data 

of our suppliers, which allowed us to 

assess and monitor their sustainability 

performance. In 2020, the Group began 

efforts to digitalise the data collection 

process to enhance efficiency. Keppel O&amp;M, 

including its overseas entities, has included 

the ESG scorecard as part of its supplier 

qualification process. We are working to 

progressively implement the ESG scorecard 

across the rest of our business units with 

a goal to complete the implementation by 

the end of 2021.

Keppel recognises the challenging 

environment faced by many small and 

medium enterprises (SMEs) as a result of 

COVID-19. We work with a network of about 

3,000 SMEs in Singapore. Over a period of 

six months in 2020, we supported these 

SMEs financially by expediting payments 

regardless of the previously-agreed terms, 

waiving some requirements relating to 

unfulfillment of contractual liquidated 

damages, and providing a series of 

measures to support tenants in our 

commercial properties to help improve 

their cashflow. We also worked closely 

with our subcontractors to ensure 

compliance with the evolving Ministry 

of Manpower and Ministry of Health 

guidelines on the living conditions, 

health, safety and welfare of workers.

DUE DILIGENCE

Keppel is committed to managing the 

inherent risks arising from our supply 

chains. The assessment of supplier 

risks and due diligence measures 

undertaken by the Group is an ongoing 

process which takes place throughout 

the lifecycle of a supplier relationship.

For example, Keppel O&amp;M conducts 

regular audits of resident subcontractors to 

ensure their adherence to the International 

Labour Organisation’s declaration on 

fundamental principles and rights at work 

and Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower 

Marine Sponsorship Scheme requirements 

for the employment of local and 

foreign employees.

The scope of these audits includes fair 

remuneration, living standards, workplace 

safety and abuse and harassment. 

Keppel O&amp;M ensures that monthly 

interviews are done directly with subcontract 

workers on a rotational basis to determine 

their levels of satisfaction pertaining to the 

above topics. The respective management 

of the subcontractor companies are then 

required to address any areas of concern, 

under a structured mechanism of 

monitoring and close out. 

Migrant workers are an important part 

of Keppel O&amp;M’s workforce. In line with 

our efforts to enhance the well-being of 

migrant workers, Keppel O&amp;M wrote to its 

contractors and employment agents earlier 

this year to require that they abide by the 

Dhaka Principles for Migration with Dignity 

on a going forward basis. The Dhaka 

Principles are a set of human rights-based 

principles to enhance respect for the rights 

of migrant workers from the moment of 

recruitment, during overseas employment, 

and through to safe return to home 

countries. The principles include no 

charging of recruitment or placement fees 

to migrant workers, the provision of clear 

and transparent worker contracts and safe 

and decent living conditions, among others. 

EVALUATION

Stage 4

We conduct regular reviews 

and assessments of supplier 

performance, with an 

emphasis on our contractors. 

This includes reviewing their 

performance in relation to 

topics covered in our supplier 

code of conduct. Our work 

teams provide feedback to  

our procurement teams to 

help determine whether 

suppliers will be retained in 

our list of approved suppliers.

channel our resources to 

support and enhance the 

sustainability performance  

of these suppliers, and make 

a bigger impact.

Keppel with products and

SUPPLY CHAIN AND RESPONSIBLE PROCUREMENT

STRATEGIC PILLAR: RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS


Keppel Land has in place a five-step supply 

chain management process that covers 

the whole lifecycle of its project from 

its initiation and design development 

stages to subsequent construction and 

operation stages. 

For all project sites covered under the scope 

of Keppel Land’s environmental management 

system, contractors are required to conduct 

impact assessment based on activities 

at the project site prior to construction.  

The assessment covers potential negative 

environmental impacts, including depletion 

of resources, biodiversity disturbance as well 

as air, water and noise pollution. Contractors 

are required to establish and implement 

appropriate measures to mitigate and/or 

prevent significant environmental impacts.

Keppel Land also conducts regular site visits 

and internal audits as part of its supplier 

due diligence process. All site audits, which 

focused mainly on environmental and safety 

compliance, were conducted in accordance 

with the prevailing COVID-19 safe management 

measures in the respective countries. 

When lapses are identified, the company’s 

project team works closely with contractors 

to implement corrective action plans and 

preventive measures. 

Identifying and auditing high ESG-risk critical 

suppliers enable us to allocate our resources 

to suppliers whom we can have the greatest 

impact on and support in improving their 

sustainability practices and performance.

In 2019, we developed an audit framework 

to manage sustainability risks among 

our critical suppliers. Critical suppliers 

are determined by the following factors: 

cumulative order value, single order value 

and order volume, and other business 

criteria such as component criticality and 

non-substitutable products or services. 

ESG risks are assessed based on a country 

risk perspective in areas such as human 

rights, corruption, and the country’s 

environmental regulatory framework. 

Sustainability audits will be conducted 

for high ESG risk critical suppliers, and 

corrective action plans will be implemented 

where necessary. 

BUILDING CAPABILITIES

GRI 403-7

We work closely with our suppliers and 

contractors to maintain high standards 

of conduct throughout our business 

engagements. All our employees, including 

procurement and subcontracting staff, 

are required to abide by the Keppel Group 

Code of Conduct and undertake refresher 

training on the code on an annual basis. The  

e-training comprises all the elements within the 

code of conduct, including anti-corruption 

and gifts and hospitality policies. 

Forums and dialogue sessions with suppliers 

and contractors are held regularly to ensure 

alignment between the Keppel Supplier 

Code of Conduct and the respective codes 

of conduct of our suppliers and contractors, 

share experiences, and communicate our 

expectations regarding performance. Our 

business units have incentive programmes 

that reward and recognise contractors with 

exemplary HSE performance. 

Keppel O&amp;M conducts outreach programmes 

and briefings to subcontractor workers to 

inform them of their employment rights, 

and the available channels to report any 

violation of their rights. The Company also 

collaborates with Singapore’s Ministry of 

Manpower to raise awareness among 

subcontractors on the common breaches in 

the industry in relation to the requirements 

under the Marine Sponsorship Scheme. 

In addition to face-to-face briefings at 

work sites, we use multiple communication 

channels, such as virtual meetings and 

regular email broadcasts, to effectively 

reach out to our suppliers and contractors.

To help prevent the spread of the pandemic, 

we enhanced efforts to communicate with 

our contractors and subcontractors on 

COVID-19 regulations and safe management 

measures implemented at each work site. 

Many of our contractors and subcontractors 

chose to house their workers within 

dormitories operated by Keppel Housing, 

which deployed resources to ensure the 

highest levels of cleanliness and hygiene 

within the dormitories. For more details, 

please refer to pages 78 and 79 of this report.

by the client and our project teams to ensure 

compliance to the client’s HSE standards. 

In response to COVID-19, Keppel’s 

environmental infrastructure operations 

and maintenance teams effectively 

implemented the necessary business 

contingency plans and safe management 

measures to ensure continuity of the essential 

services it provides. These included split 

team arrangements and extra temporary 

living arrangements for its workers. Through 

the diligence and hard work of the local 

and overseas teams, Keppel Infrastructure 

delivered uninterrupted operations safely 

across its operations in 2020.

Keppel Land has adopted the guidelines on 

design for safety in buildings and structure 

for all its new projects in Singapore since 

2008. The guidelines are in line with the 

Singapore Workplace Safety and Health 

Council’s design for safety regulations, 

which have been implemented since 

2016. The guidelines require safety and 

health risks to be incorporated into the 

early conceptual and planning phases of a 

project, enabling designers and consultants 

to reduce these risks through good design 

and effective project planning. 

M1 is certified to the ISO 22301:2012 

Business Continuity Management  

System. This standard is designed to help 

organisations prepare for, respond to and 

recover from unexpected and disruptive 

incidents. In 2020, M1 conducted an internal 

surveillance audit exercise for the IMDA 

Data Protection Trustmark certification. 

It also conducts e-learning training to 

ensure all staff are well-versed in the area 

of personal data protection.

FOSTERING INNOVATION

Established in 2004, the Keppel Technology 

Advisory Panel (KTAP) includes eminent 

business leaders and industry experts from 

across the world. KTAP members provide 

technology foresight for Keppel, advise on 

strategic projects and provide contacts to 

broaden Keppel’s networks. 

In 2020, KTAP focused on the Vision 2030 

themes of Energy &amp; Environment, Urban 

Development, Connectivity and Asset 

Management, with individual topics dedicated 

to the Vision 2030 growth engines. These 

topics included the energy transition and the 

resultant opportunities in renewable energy 

such as offshore wind and hydrogen; the 

increasing demand for PropTech across 

asset classes; the 5G eco-system, as well as 

the changes in consumer behaviour and 

lifestyle as a result of COVID-19, amongst 

others. This lays the foundation for Keppel’s 

transformation plans to be one integrated 

business and a provider of end-to-end solutions 

for sustainable urbanisation.

In 2020, KTI focused on supporting 

Keppel’s Vision 2030 through technology 

and stepped up efforts to assist major 

business units with their digital transformation 

efforts, contributing expertise and guidance 

towards various strategic projects. KTI and 

the Group Health,  Safety &amp; Environment 

division partnered multiple business units, 

including Keppel O&amp;M, Keppel Land, M1 

and Keppel Logistics, to pilot an integrated 

digital safety management system to 

kickstart Keppel’s Safety 4.0 journey with 

GOARC, an artificial intelligence safety

BOARD &amp; MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT 

Keppel Corporation was the first publicly 

listed company in Singapore to establish 

a Board Safety Committee (BSC) in 2006. 

In 2020, the BSC was chaired by Mr Tan Ek Kia, 

then a non-executive and independent 

director of Keppel Corporation, who retired 

from the Board in April 2021. The BSC is 

currently chaired by Mr Teo Siong Seng, 

a non-executive and non-independent 

director of Keppel Corporation. The BSC 

adopts a hands-on approach in setting 

the strategic direction and establishing 

a safety framework to ensure that 

consistently high safety standards are 

maintained across our business units. 

Major incidents are also shared and 

discussed at quarterly BSC meetings to 

prevent recurrence.

The BSC leads efforts to implement initiatives 

and improve performance with the support 

of the Keppel Group HSE Committee, which 

comprises representatives from all our 

business units.

third-party suppliers and contractors are also 

expected to abide by the Keppel Corporation 

HSE Policy, which places the highest priority 

on the health and safety of people and the 

protection of assets and the environment.

Our safety management system is routinely 

audited by independent certification bodies/ 

companies and internal audit teams. 

For example, Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine’s 

(Keppel O&amp;M) cross-business unit audits, 

and Keppel Infrastructure’s inspection 

for Safety Compliance Assurance (iSCA), 

ensure that policies and management 

systems are adhered to and that safety 

standards across operations are aligned.

The Group strives to achieve safety 

certifications in line with global best 

practices. As part of the Group’s continuous 

improvement efforts, we are working to 

meet the requirements under the new 

ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety 

Management System which provides 

a robust set of processes for improving 

safety in global supply chains. To date, 

Keppel O&amp;M’s yards in Singapore, Brazil, 

China and the Philippines; Keppel Housing; 

Keppel Infrastructure; Keppel Land’s Singapore, 

China, and Vietnam divisions; as well as 

our five data centres in Singapore have 

achieved ISO 45001 certification.

In addition, Keppel Logistics is certified to 

meet the hazard analysis and critical control 

point management system. Our Keppel DC 

Singapore 1 and 2 data centres are also 

certified to meet the Singapore Standard 

for information and communications 

technology disaster recovery services.

HAZARD IDENTIFICATION &amp; 

RISK MANAGEMENT

Across the Group, we establish and 

implement procedures to identify, assess 

and mitigate safety and health hazards 

related to our operations.

As part of hazard identification and 

risk management, our operational and 

safety teams conduct periodic workplace 

inspections and internal audits. Training is 

conducted to equip HSE personnel with the 

skills to effectively manage safety risks. Union 

workers and subcontractor representatives 

are invited to participate in meetings where 

the identification of hazards, assessment of 

risks and the application of control measures 

are discussed. For business units whose 

workers do not belong to unions, worker 

representatives are nominated by the 

various departments to participate in 

monthly safety committee meetings.

Keppel’s operations are guided by 

five key safety principles:

1. Every incident is preventable;

2. HSE is an integral part of our business;

3. HSE is a line responsibility;

4. Everyone is empowered to stop any 

unsafe work; and

5. A strong safety culture is achieved 

through teamwork.

Findings from our risk assessments are 

considered in the determination of facility 

requirements, training programmes 

and operational controls. For example, 

Keppel Infrastructure’s process safety 

management techniques incorporate

Our key business units have also 

established their own respective BSCs 

to oversee safety strategy and practices. 

In 2020, Keppel Corporation’s BSC and 

the BSCs of our business units conducted 

safety visits at four worksites in Singapore 

to engage staff. No overseas visits were 

conducted in view of travel restrictions due 

to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, the BSC 

was regularly updated by the Keppel Group 

HSE Committee on developments on 

the ground.

STRATEGY, POLICY &amp; 

MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

Our approach to safety management is 

guided by the Keppel Zero Fatality Strategy. 

Introduced in 2016, the strategy outlines 

actionable items to reduce workplace 

fatalities to zero through five strategic 

thrusts. The Group also introduced the 

Group HSE Framework in 2020, which 

articulates the Group’s HSE vision and how 

it aligns with the Company’s core values, 

safety principles, as well as policies and 

objectives, in order to drive the safety agenda 

across the Group and allow Keppel to 

achieve leading HSE performance across 

the industries we are in.

KEY SAFETY INITIATIVES

Every year, we aim to implement several 

key initiatives to strengthen our safety 

culture across the Group. In 2020, we:

• Embarked on a global transformation 

programme to digitalise and streamline 

our key HSE systems and processes;

• Launched a proof of concept to leverage 

technology such as data analytics 

and artificial intelligence to gather 

data and provide real-time insights of 

risk patterns;

• Sharpened our focus on occupational 

health and the well-being of 

our employees;

• Continued to execute the Zero Fatality 

Strategy; and

• Completed the migration of our health &amp; 

safety management system to the new 

ISO 45001:2018 standard for major 

business units.

The effectiveness of our management 

approach is reviewed regularly. During the 

annual HSE Roundtable, senior management 

from across the Group share insights and 

best practices, and exchange ideas to 

improve safety performance. The action 

plan generated during the session is 

incorporated into the Group’s safety 

roadmap and strategies.

All employees and contractors at the worksites 

of the Group’s companies where Keppel has 

operational control are covered by our HSE 

management systems. All employees and

Following the start of the pandemic, 

the Group rolled out a series of measures, 

including more frequent cleaning of office 

facilities, temperature screening, split teams, 

alternative work sites, safe distancing 

and working from home where practical. 

In addition, across the Group’s business 

units, pandemic representatives have been 

identified and trained in the protocols 

and procedures to handle confirmed and 

suspected cases of COVID-19. Training 

topics include isolation, evacuation and 

contract tracing. The Group also has a pool 

of crisis first responders that are trained 

to provide emotional and psychological 

support to affected staff. These measures 

are not new to Keppel as our various sites 

have been holding pandemic preparedness 

exercises over the years as part of business 

continuity plans to minimise disruptions.

In early 2020, Keppel Capital issued its 

entities with specific guidelines on handling 

infectious pandemic diseases to help them 

manage the emerging risk of rising 

COVID-19 cases. They also launched a 

series of COVID-19 safety messages online 

to keep staff morale up and remind frontline 

workers to stay vigilant at work 

as businesses and assets in some entities 

under Keppel Capital continued to operate 

during the COVID-19 lockdown in Singapore 

as they were providing essential services.

In March 2021, Ocean Financial Centre, 

which is managed by Keppel Land, also 

became the first commercial development 

in Singapore to achieve the WELL Health-

Safety Rating by the International WELL 

Building Institute. The award recognises 

building owners that take necessary steps 

to prioritise the health and safety of their 

staff, visitors and stakeholders during the 

COVID-19 crisis and in the long-term.

At our worksites, it is mandatory for all 

workers, including contract workers, to be 

covered by work injury compensation 

insurance prior to starting work. In-house 

medical centres are also located in all our 

shipyards. Across the Group, our contractors 

partner with clinics to provide contract 

workers with access to medical care.

Keppel also promotes the wellness of 

its workforce through programmes that 

We are leveraging technology and have embarked 

on a global transformation programme to digitalise

our Zero Fatality Strategy.

the use of the Bow-tie model as well as 

hazard and operability studies to identify 

and assess likely events that can result 

in critical failures.

We are also leveraging technology to 

drive improvements in our hazard and 

risk management, which is a key pillar of 

our Zero Fatality Strategy. Group HSE is 

collaborating with Keppel Technology &amp; 

Innovation to explore the use of various 

analytics and business intelligence tools 

to harness data from incidents, identify 

hazards, as well as conduct safety reporting, 

observations and inspections.

Keppel O&amp;M and M1, together with other 

partners, are working on the software and 

hardware of a smart wearables initiative to 

improve workforce safety and productivity. 

Samsung smart watches equipped with 

features such as heart rate monitoring 

and fall detection have been distributed to 

workers. If a wearer is in distress, an SOS 

signal can be triggered via the smart watch 

to seek immediate assistance. The smart 

watch is able to provide the real-time 

position of the wearer for emergency 

response teams, should incidents occur, 

and is also equipped with features to 

facilitate COVID-19 Safe Management 

Measures. Geofencing, for instance, creates 

a virtual geographic boundary to ensure 

that workers operate in their assigned work 

zones to support safe distancing. Workers 

entering an unassigned work zone and 

risking possible cross-contamination will 

receive a notification on their smart watch 

to return to their designated zones.

To protect workers from potential health 

hazards, hearing conservation and respiratory 

protection programmes are implemented 

at certain sites with higher risk levels. 

To protect against noise-induced hearing 

loss, employees with exposure to noise 

are required to wear hearing protection gear 

and are screened at annual audiometric 

tests conducted by a mobile medical unit.

During the daily Take 5 toolbox meeting, 

workers are briefed on work-specific 

hazards including proper ergonomic 

practices in material handling. For example, 

at Keppel Shipyard, fit tests are conducted 

to ensure that respirators used are in good 

condition and correctly fit each user 

before usage.

PROMOTION OF WORKER HEALTH

Keppel employees have been receiving 

regular updates from Keppel’s Group 

Business Continuity Management 

Committee and Group Risk &amp; Compliance

protect its staff and other stakeholders, 

as well as ensure business continuity 

during the COVID-19 pandemic.

such as core competency and leadership 

development programmes, and workforce 

skills qualification courses certified by the 

Singapore Workforce Development Agency, 

which are conducted by qualified, full-time 

instructors. This model has been replicated 

at our yards in Brazil, China, the Philippines 

and the United States.

In 2020, the Keppel Safety Training Centre 

developed four augmented reality and 

virtual reality modules, to be integrated into 

the safety training curriculum to enhance 

employees’ learning experience. Training 

sessions simulate the safety decision 

making process that employees are likely 

to face onsite. Through various safety 

scenarios, trainees can virtually experience 

the impact of falling from height, flash fires, 

and being hit by moving objects if they do 

not follow safety guidelines. 

Keppel Infrastructure was awarded the 

in-house Approved Training Organisation 

status by SkillsFuture Singapore in June 2020. 

In the same year, M1 developed HSE 

e-learning modules and assessments 

for all staff. As part of the Group’s 

commitment to sharing safety knowledge 

and best practices, Keppel Capital also 

shared its experience with other business 

units in managing Safety Case Regimes 

for Major Hazard Installations (MHI) 

under Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower 

regulations, as well as chemical storage 

and handling. 

At Keppel Land, Safety Awareness Centres 

(SAC) are built to provide mandatory training 

for contractors’ employees and foster a 

safety culture across Keppel Land’s supply 

chain for the duration of the project’s 

construction. Keppel Land’s mobile centre 

in Wuxi, China, is deployed to Keppel’s 

various offices and worksites in China 

to enhance safety awareness. We are 

currently also designing an SAC to be 

built to support the Saigon Sports City 

development in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. 

ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS

We work closely with all stakeholders, 

including our contractors, subcontractors, 

customers, suppliers, regulators and 

industry associations, to maintain high 

safety standards throughout our workforce. 

Our subcontract workers undergo the 

same training as direct employees.

To collectively raise industry standards 

and stay abreast of industry best practices, 

members of Keppel’s management and 

safety representatives are members of 

various councils and committees of the 

Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council, 

such as the WSH (Marine Industries) 

committee, WSH (Construction and 

Landscape) committee, National Work 

address physical and mental health-related 

risks. Voluntary health promotion programmes 

and services across the Group include a 

smoking cessation hotline, healthy snacks 

in pantries and canteens, as well as fitness 

classes. Regular health talks on stress 

management and diabetes prevention, 

among others, are organised at various 

work sites. 

Dormitories housing migrant workers 

are also equipped with gyms and sports 

facilities such as basketball, badminton 

and street soccer courts to promote 

healthy lifestyles. Keppel O&amp;M conducts 

regular dormitory visits to engage 

workers on health and safety issues. 

Keppel Shipyard offers holistic health and 

medical services and is equipped with a 

pharmacy, counselling rooms and designated 

rest areas. To provide workers with conducive 

environments to rest during breaks, 

Keppel Shipyard built three 4-storey rest 

areas, which can each accommodate up 

to 2,000 workers. The occupancy of the 

rest areas has been lowered during the 

pandemic, in line with prevailing safe 

management measures.

In addition, the Keppel Wellness Gallery 

at Keppel Shipyard features interactive 

health exhibits to educate employees 

on the importance of having proper 

nutrition, active lifestyles and good 

mental health.

ENHANCING SKILLSETS

We empower and train our stakeholders 

to ensure that all personnel are updated 

on safety measures and best practices, 

including migrant workers who are an 

important part of our workforce. In 2020, 

we invested approximately $22 million 

in enhancing safety-related infrastructure, 

upgrading systems and building knowledge 

and skillsets across the Group.

All personnel entering any Keppel-operated 

site must attend a site-specific safety 

induction to gain familiarity on the basic 

safety requirements and potentially 

hazardous on-site activities or situations. 

In addition, all workers must undergo 

HIRA training which covers high-risk 

activities specific to each work site.

The Keppel Safety Training Centre at 

Keppel O&amp;M in Singapore offers a complete 

range of training and certification courses 

in both trade-specific and broad-based skills 

for all levels of the workforce. The centre 

is equipped with classrooms, an e-learning 

zone, and a hall with multimedia and 

interactive training stations. It also features

The centre offers key training modules 

at Height Taskforce, related industrial 

associations such as the Association 

of Singapore Marine Industries and 

Real Estate Developers’ Association 

of Singapore; as well as Singapore 

Standards Council’s General Engineering

As a bizSAFE partner, Keppel O&amp;M actively 

encourages contractors to progress through 

the levels of the bizSAFE programme. Since 

2018, Keppel O&amp;M has imposed a bizSAFE 

Level 4 (second-highest) certification 

requirement for resident contractors before 

they are able to undertake work at our yards. 

Keppel Infrastructure’s key subsidiaries, 

as bizSAFE partners, also imposed bizSAFE 

Level 3 for all local supplier of services and 

bizSAFE Level 2 for all local supplier of goods. 

Under the guidance by Keppel DHCS’ O&amp;M 

management team, some contractors have 

attained bizSAFE Star.

 

In accordance with the Company’s HSE 

policy, business units are required to 

report and investigate all accidents, 

incidents and near misses, and ensure 

that lessons learnt are shared to prevent 

any recurrence. All Group companies 

where Keppel has operational control 

are required to report incidents, including 

those that involve third parties such as 

contractors, clients and visitors at our 

premises, as well as employees working 

at third-party sites or commuting for 

work-related purposes.

At worksites, safety time-outs are conducted 

immediately after an incident occurs to 

heighten awareness among the involved 

work groups. Reportable incidents and 

high potential near misses are also 

promptly reported to senior management.

PERFORMANCE

GRI 403-9 | 419-1

In 2020, the Group reported a total accident 

severity rate (ASR) of 76 man-days lost 

per million man-hours, up from 12 man-days 

in 2019; and a total accident frequency 

rate (AFR) of 0.27 accidents per million 

man-hours in 2020, up from 0.18 in 20191.

Despite our best efforts, the Group recorded 

one fatality for its global operations in 2020. 

The incident was associated with vessel 

propulsion works in one of Keppel O&amp;M’s 

shipyards in Singapore. We are deeply 

saddened by the loss of our colleague. 

An immediate stand-down was conducted 

for the work group involved. An investigation 

team was formed to thoroughly investigate 

the root causes, which were related to 

working in the line of fire and lifting operations. 

We determined the contributing factors and 

identified steps to prevent similar incidents 

in the future. Lessons learnt were shared 

across the Group.

The Group reported a total of 23 safety 

incidents2 in 2020, of which 11 incidents 

involved our direct workforce and 

12 incidents involved our contractors. 

The top three incident types are:

• Caught in between objects;

• Struck by moving objects;

• Slips, trips and falls.

In 2020, 46 insurance pay-outs were made 

under Work Injury Compensation Schemes, 

due to high-consequence3 incidents that 

occurred either in or before 2020.

All work-related incidents are jointly 

investigated by the operational and safety 

teams. Where appropriate, an independent 

team is set up to investigate fatal and high 

potential incidents. All incident investigations 

include an account of the events leading up to 

the incident, how it occurred and post-incident 

actions, as well as a root cause analysis (RCA), 

based on the Keppel RCA methodology that 

was developed in-house, and corrective 

action plans to prevent recurrence.

All of the Group’s operational entities 

monitor occurrences of occupational 

disease at their individual sites based 

on their region’s regulatory requirements. 

In 2020, no workers were diagnosed with 

Noise Induced Deafness, a major risk for 

the industries that Keppel is involved in.

A workplace accident that results in the injury of an employee who is given more than three consecutive days of 

medical leave or hospitalised for at least 24 hours; or a workplace accident that results in the injury of a 

self-employed person or non-employee who receives treatment in hospital.

A high-consequence incident is one from which the worker cannot, does not, or is not expected to recover fully 

to pre-injury health status within 6 months (e.g. amputation of limb, fracture with complications). This definition 

is adopted across Keppel’s global operations.

Keppel Corporation Limited  

69


from Alpine Engineering, a subsidiary 

of Keppel O&amp;M, won the WSH Award for 

Supervisors for his strong leadership by 

example and ability to connect with and 

inspire workers under his charge.

ENHANCING COMMUNICATION

Keppel’s five key safety principles are 

regularly highlighted to ingrain safety 

consciousness among all stakeholders. 

Group HSE Alerts are disseminated to 

share lessons learnt globally and ensure 

that preventive measures are taken 

promptly across all worksites.

Over 1,100 Keppelites, union members, 

contractors, partners and business associates 

came together for the 14th Keppel Group 

Safety Convention on 27 October 2020 to 

reaffirm their commitment to safety. This 

year’s convention was held virtually for 

the first time, allowing many more guests 

to participate compared to previous physical 

events, including Keppel employees overseas. 

21 Keppelites were recognised for their 

outstanding contributions to workplace 

safety and health in the Keppel Group 

Safety Awards.

The fourth annual Global Safety Time-Out 

was held on 2 August 2020 to reiterate 

Keppel’s commitment to safety. 

During the time-out, frontline managers 

shared safety messages and best 

practices with Keppelites as well as 

our subcontractors.

During the year, the Group paid two 

significant1 fines amounting to a total of 

$260,000 in relation to two fatal accidents 

involving contractors at one of Keppel O&amp;M’s 

shipyards in Singapore in March and May 2014. 

The Group also paid two fines amounting 

to $55,000 in relation to noisy activities at 

one of Keppel Land’s construction sites 

in Singapore in February 2020. Immediate 

rectification actions and mitigation measures 

were taken to prevent recurrence.

RECOGNITION

The Group was conferred 21 WSH Awards in 

2020 by Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower and 

the WSH Council. This is the highest number 

of awards won by a single organisation in 

the year.

Of the 21 awards, Keppel O&amp;M bagged 

17 awards under the Safety and Health 

Award Recognition for Projects (SHARP) 

category for exemplary project safety and 

health management systems. Keppel O&amp;M 

(New Builds Division) also clinched the WSH 

Performance (Silver) Award for outstanding 

safety performance and implementation 

of strong WSH management systems. 

In addition, Keppel O&amp;M and Keppel DHCS 

garnered WSH Innovation Awards, which 

recognise companies for creating solutions 

which help to improve safety and enhance 

operations at the workplace. 

At the individual level, Mr Sappanimuthu  

Govindaraju, Hull Superintendent at 

Keppel O&amp;M, clinched the WSH Award for 

Supervisors for his strong commitment 

to the safety of workers under his charge, 

while Mr Reza Mohammad Shamin 



In 2020, augmented reality and virtual reality modules were integrated into the training curriculum at the Keppel Safety 

Training Centre allowing employees to experience simulations of various safety scenarios like falling from height.

Keppel supports re-employability beyond 

the statutory retirement age. Eligible 

employees are offered post-retirement 

employment opportunities in Keppel, 

in line with the Singapore Tripartite 

Guidelines on the Re-employment of 

Older Employees. As at 31 December 2020, 

there were 140 re-employed staff in the Group, 

of whom 60 were re-employed in 2020.

COMPENSATION &amp; BENEFITS

Keppel subscribes to a pay-for-performance 

philosophy. 

Opportunities for advancement, promotion, 

recognition, compensation, training, and other 

conditions of employment are provided 

based on merit. Performance reviews are 

conducted for permanent employees. The 

process, undertaken jointly by the employee 

and supervisor, entails target setting and 

review on an annual basis. 

Our employees in Singapore and overseas 

are provided with a comprehensive range 

of benefits that may include paid vacation 

leave, medical benefits and group insurance 

plans. In Singapore, part-time employees 

are entitled to similar benefits on a  

pro-rata basis. 

Migrant workers are an important part of 

our workforce in Singapore, especially in 

Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine (Keppel O&amp;M). 

Many of these workers have been with 

the company for many years and have 

risen to supervisory positions. Besides 

competitive wages and bonuses for eligible 

employees, migrant workers under direct 

employment in Singapore also enjoy other 

benefits such as subsidised housing and 

medical care.

In Singapore, in accordance with the 

Ministry of Manpower’s current legislation, 

eligible female employees are entitled to 

eight weeks of paid maternity leave and 

up to an additional eight weeks. Eligible 

male employees are entitled to two weeks 

of paid paternity leave. In Singapore, 

we had a 98.2% return to work rate for 

the 114 female employees who went on 

maternity leave, and 100% return to work 

rate for the 123 male employees who 

went on paternity leave. Of the employees 

in Singapore who went on parental leave, 

212 remained in employment as at 

end-2020.

Globally3, we had a 96.1% return to work rate 

for the 152 female employees who went 

on maternity leave, and 100% return to

The Keppel Group adheres to the respective 

social security contribution or pension 

plan obligations of the countries in which 

we operate. For example, in Singapore, 

the Central Provident Fund (CPF) is a 

comprehensive social security savings plan 

that enables salaried Singapore citizens and 

permanent residents to set aside funds to 

work towards a secure retirement. Under the 

CPF scheme, Keppel and its employees make 

monthly contributions to the employees’ 

CPF accounts in accordance with the 

prevailing regulations.

In China, Keppel’s entities and employees 

make monthly contributions to the social 

security system which comprises five types 

of insurance, namely pension, medical, 

unemployment, maternity and injury, and 

a mandatory housing fund. Contribution 

rates and caps for each benefit vary 

according to local jurisdictions. 

In Brazil, Keppel and its employees contribute 

monthly to the National Institute of Social 

Security which works as a social protection 

system to ensure the livelihood of the 

worker and/or his family in cases of illness, 

accidents, pregnancy, imprisonment, etc.

In the United States, the Social Security 

Administration is a government programme 

funded through payroll taxes on all workers, 

employers and self-employed individuals. 

The social security tax dollars go into a trust 

fund that provides income for retired workers 

or people with disabilities. It also pays survivor 

benefits to legal dependents of workers who 

have died. The social security tax is applied 

to income earned by employees and 

self-employed taxpayers. Employers usually 

withhold this tax from employees’ pay 

cheques and contribute a matching portion 

to the government. The social security tax 

rate is assessed on all types of income 

earned by an employee, including salaries, 

wages, and bonuses. There is an income 

limit to which the tax rate is imposed.

In the Philippines, Keppel and its employees 

make monthly contributions to the Social 

Security System, a state-run, social insurance 

programme for workers in the private, 

professional and informal sectors. The 

programme provides death, funeral, maternity 

leave, permanent disability, retirement, 

sickness and unemployment benefits. 

HUMAN RIGHTS

We uphold and respect the fundamental 

principles set out in the United Nations (UN) 

Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 

the International Labour Organisation’s 

Declaration on Fundamental Principles and 

Rights at Work. Our approach to human 

rights is informed and guided by general 

concepts from the UN Guiding Principles on 

Women have long played a pivotal part in the Keppel story, running the business and driving growth in all business 

units, and at all levels of the Group. As part of International Women’s Day in 2021, Keppel launched a series on Keppel 

Corporation’s LinkedIn page to showcase ten of its women leaders and share their perspectives and experiences.

LABOUR PRACTICES, TALENT MANAGEMENT 

AND HUMAN RIGHTS

STRATEGIC PILLAR: PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY


Business and Human Rights. Keppel 

Corporation is a signatory of the UN Global 

Compact and is committed to the 

Compact’s 10 universal principles, which 

include principles on human rights and 

labour practices.

We have zero tolerance for unethical labour 

practices such as child labour, forced labour, 

slavery and human trafficking in all of our 

operations. Our suppliers are expected to 

abide by the Keppel Supplier Code of Conduct, 

which holds them accountable for responsible 

labour practices in their operations.

Our commitment to human rights is supported 

by the Keppel Group Code of Conduct, 

which sets the tone in relation to the Group’s 

stance against discrimination on any basis. 

Our stance on human rights is articulated 

in the Keppel Group Human Rights Policy 

which is publicly available online.

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

Unions are our partners and we place great 

emphasis on maintaining harmonious 

and collaborative relationships with them. 

Of our global workforce eligible for union 

representation, approximately 87.6% 

are union members who are covered by 

collective agreements. This is approximately 

23.5% of our global workforce.

Guidelines are in place for the appropriate 

management of grievance cases. For unionised 

companies, employee grievances are resolved 

according to the grievance handling protocol 

spelt out in the respective agreements.

All registered grievances are investigated 

and tracked through to final closure. In the 

case of a grievance, our management and 

the union will undertake every reasonable 

effort to resolve the grievance promptly.

Across our businesses worldwide, there 

were 11 grievance cases1 reported in 2020, 

all of which have been resolved.

DIVERSITY &amp; INCLUSION

We value and respect all employees regardless 

of ethnicity, gender, religious beliefs, 

nationality, age or any physical disability. 

Our stance on diversity and inclusion is 

articulated in our corporate statement on 

diversity and inclusion, which was formalised 

in early 2019, and is publicly available online.

In Singapore, a “workplace grievance” is as defined 

by the Ministry of Manpower, i.e. “discontent or the  

feeling of being victimised at work”. Our overseas 

business units reference the following in defining 

a workplace grievance – the Keppel Group Code 

of Conduct, the employment laws and regulations 

of the country of operation, and the collective 

agreement between the company and the 

employee union, where applicable.

TRAINING &amp; TALENT DEVELOPMENT 

GRI 404-1 | 404-2

Our hiring policies ensure equal employment 

opportunities for all. Our employment 

statistics, reviewed regularly, illustrate 

the diversity of our workforce. As at 

31 December 2020, 22% of our employees 

are female, compared to 20.3% in 2019.  

We recognise that there are certain segments 

in our businesses, such as offshore 

and marine, which tend to attract larger 

proportions of male employees due to 

the nature of the jobs. At our corporate office 

and in certain parts of our businesses, such 

as Keppel Capital, female employees account 

for more than half of our workforce. Close 

to 62% of the staff in Keppel Corporation’s 

Corporate Office, as well as 36% of our 

Heads of Departments are females. 

Females also represent close to 30% of 

our senior management1 and managerial2 

positions in the Group.

In 2020, across our global operations, 

the average pay of female employees 

was 92.7% of the average pay of male 

employees for non-managerial positions. 

For senior management and managerial 

positions, the average pay of female 

employees was 91.1% of the average 

pay of male employees.

There were no reported incidences of 

discrimination raised by our employees 

in 2020.

TRAINING &amp; TALENT DEVELOPMENT

GRI 404-1 | 404-2

We empower employees through learning 

and development programmes and 

encourage them to reach their full potential. 

In 2020, the overall global average number 

of training hours3 per employee was 

approximately 19.0 hours, with an average 

of 21.9 hours for females and 18.2 hours for 

males. Digital learning was also stepped up 

during the year with more e-learning 

platforms adopted, which empowered 

employees to pursue learning opportunities 

online while working from home. 

Keppel Corporation’s Group Human Resources 

and Keppel People Services drive and 

coordinate efforts across the business 

units to ensure consistency in processes 

such as performance management and 

talent management.

In 2020, Keppel Capital ran a virtual 

learning initiative geared towards the digital 

economy. The initiative comprised virtual 

learning sessions for employees focused 

on topics such as agile fundamentals, 

data analytics, data visualisation and design 

innovation. Keppel Land also rolled out 

a digital upskilling series to encourage 

employees to embrace e-learning while 

working from home. To support continuous 

learning, Keppel O&amp;M created bite-sized 

content and virtual classes to allow 

employees to learn at their own pace 

and schedules.

LEADERSHIP PROGRAMMES

Keppel Leadership Institute, headquartered 

in Singapore, offers a diverse range of 

leadership and development programmes, 

delivered in modular and blended approaches. 

These programmes are regularly refreshed 

to suit the Group’s evolving needs. Over 

200 employees have participated in the 

institute’s leadership programmes since 2015.

About 165 employees are part of the 

Keppel Young Leaders programme, 

which is the Group’s platform to nurture 

young talents. Members of the programme 

are given opportunities to lead high-impact 

projects with guidance from senior 

management across the Group. 

Separately, the Keppel Associate Programme, 

a two-year management associate 

programme, offers high potential talents, 

who are fresh out of university, with varied 

opportunities for leadership development 

through a series of job rotations and 

structured learning.

INDUSTRY PROGRAMMES

The Group makes significant investments to 

equip employees with up-to-date operational 

skills and certifications. We support employees 

at all levels of the company in furthering their 

education. In 2020, the Group sponsored 

12 employees in pursuing further studies.

GOVERNMENT WORKFORCE 

PROGRAMMES

In partnership with the Singapore government, 

the Group supports the Singapore-Industry 

Scholarship which sponsors Singapore 

citizens pursuing their undergraduate 

studies in areas related to Singapore’s 

strategic sectors. In 2020, the Group 

supported five students in the programme.

In partnership with Ngee Ann Polytechnic, 

Keppel committed to provide 25 six-month 

work attachments to aspiring data analysts 

under the SGUnited Skills Programme for 

data analytics.

In 2020, Keppel took on 48 trainees as part 

of the Singapore government’s SGUnited 

Traineeship and Mid-Career Pathways 

programmes, which aim to help fresh 

graduates and mid-careerists develop 

their skills professionally and widen their 

professional networks while preparing for 

more permanent jobs in the future. 

TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAMMES

To support employees through career 

transitions, human resource teams consider 

re-deploying suitable employees to other 

roles within the Group where appropriate, 

offer re-employment to eligible older 

employees, and provide transition assistance 

programmes, which include career coaching 

and training programmes, and training funds 

for employees to upskill and reskill themselves.

For example, in 2020, as part of M1’s 

strategic digital transformation plan, 

the company restructured to create new 

roles while some existing roles were 

outsourced, redesigned or made redundant. 

M1 worked closely with the Singapore 

Industrial and Services Employees’ Union 

to ensure fair treatment and compensation

The definition of senior management across our business units depends on the nature of the businesses. 

Business units that are smaller in scale define senior management to be the top three individuals with 

the highest level of executive management, while larger business units define senior management to be 

individuals holding positions that are above a specified job grade, usually Senior Management 1 and above.

The definition of managerial across the Group refers to individuals holding positions that are above 

a specified job grade, usually Manager 1 and above.

packages, and collaborated with NTUC’s e2i 

(Employment and Employability Institute) to 

provide outplacement support and training 

programmes for affected employees. Half 

of the affected workers were offered, and 

accepted, jobs with M1’s outsourced vendor 

to provide continued support for M1’s systems. 

The retrenchment exercise was carried out 

in accordance with guidelines by Singapore’s 

Ministry of Manpower, and affected employees 

were notified according to the terms in their 

contracts of service.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT SURVEY

We conducted the Keppel Global Employee 

Engagement Survey in 2020. The survey, 

which has been conducted at the Group-

level since 2009, achieved a strong response 

rate of 98% from a sample size of over 

5,000 employees. The Group achieved an 

Employee Engagement Score of 87% in 2020, 

higher than Mercer’s global average of 80%. 

In addition, 91% of employees surveyed 

indicated that they would “go beyond the 

norm” to contribute to Keppel’s success.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT INITIATIVES 

Employees are updated on company 

developments at regular staff dialogue 

sessions and through digital communication 

platforms. Staff engagement initiatives are 

also organised throughout the year to enhance 

interaction and communication between 

management and staff. 

The sixth edition of the Global Keppelites 

Forum, a Group-wide town hall meeting, 

was held in February 2020. The forum was 

attended by about 400 Keppelites in person 

and simultaneously broadcasted to about 

2,100 Keppelites across 60 satellite 

locations globally. 

During the session, Chief Executive Officer 

of Keppel Corporation Mr Loh Chin Hua, 

provided an update on the Group’s progress 

towards Vision 2020, and spurred Keppelites 

on towards setting their sights on the future 

as Vision 2030 was being finalised. Mr Loh  

highlighted the need for Keppel to grow as 

one integrated business with a clear growth 

trajectory, repeatable model and a portfolio 

focused on the Group’s key strengths. He 

also emphasised Keppel’s commitment to 

sustainability as the core of the company’s 

strategy, and unveiled the company’s 

sharpened vision and mission statements, 

as well as refreshed core values. Employees 

from across the Group also took the 

opportunity to pose questions to Mr Loh  

during a fireside chat segment. 

BUILDING STRONG TEAMS

We believe that cohesive teams are integral 

to a productive workforce. Due to the COVID-19 

pandemic, many activities, such as the annual 

Keppel Games, a series of sports competitions 

initiated by Keppelite Recreation Club, had 

to be put on hold. Businesses across the 

Group continued to build camaraderie and 

engage their employees through virtual 

platforms and events, as well as virtual 

and in-person volunteer activities organised 

by Keppel Volunteers.

WORKFORCE WELL-BEING

We are committed to the well-being of 

our entire workforce. This includes migrant 

workers who live and work away from 

their families. For more information on 

how we care for our migrant workers, 

refer to pages 78 and 79 of this report.

When the COVID-19 pandemic began in 

the first quarter of 2020, the Group adapted 

many processes and programmes, rolled 

out well-being initiatives such as online 

fitness classes and well-being workshops, 

and launched a series of e-bulletins to provide 

tips and resources to help employees work 

from home effectively and care for their 

health and mental well-being. An employee 

assistance programme was also rolled out 

by a few business units to provide mental 

health support for employees and their 

dependents, whereby employees can tap 

on the services of licensed counsellors 

from the Singapore Counselling Centre. 

To support employee well-being in the 

workplace, the Group launched Physical 

Well-being Month and Mental Well-being 

Month in June and October 2020 respectively. 

Virtual activities, such as exercise classes 

and informative webinars, were organised 

during both months to help employees to 

better care for their physical and mental 

health. The Group also organised Appreciation 

Month in August with a series of activities 

such as virtual song dedication events, 

to recognise Keppelites for their hard work 

and dedication. 

SUPPORTING NATIONAL DEFENCE

As a company headquartered in Singapore, 

we believe in contributing towards Singapore’s 

national security. National Service (NS) is a 

vital component of national defence and we 

support our employees’ NS commitments. 

Keppel Corporation was awarded the 

NS Advocate Award for Large Companies 

at the Total Defence Awards organised by 

Singapore’s Ministry of Defence in 2018. 

Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine Ltd and Keppel 

Shipyard Limited received the same 

award in 2019 as well. The Award, valid 

for a period of three years, is the highest 

accolade acknowledging businesses for 

their exemplary support towards Total 

Defence and in particular, NS.

At the Global Keppelites Forum 2020, Mr Loh Chin Hua, CEO of Keppel Corporation, spurred Keppelites on towards 

setting their sights on the future and grow as one integrated business.

CARING FOR OUR 

MIGRANT WORKERS

Migrant workers are an important part of 

Keppel’s workforce. We are committed to 

caring for the health, safety and well-being 

of our migrant workers, including the 

approximately 4,000 migrant workers 

who work at Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine 

(Keppel O&amp;M) in Singapore.

QUALITY LIVING CONDITIONS

Keppel O&amp;M provides high-quality, 

subsidised dormitories for migrant workers 

under its direct employment in Singapore. 

The dormitories are managed by Keppel 

Housing, a subsidiary of Keppel O&amp;M.

The dormitories are built and operated 

based on specifications issued by the local 

authorities and are subject to the Codes of 

Practice and Standards of Performance 

regulated by Singapore’s Foreign Employee 

Dormitories Act.

Residential units in the dormitories 

typically comprise two bedrooms, a 

common living room with a television set, 

a kitchen, as well as adjoining showers 

and toilets. The dormitories also offer 

a range of amenities such as canteens, 

supermarkets, barbers, free laundry 

services, study corners and computer 

rooms, as well as sports facilities such 

as basketball courts and gyms to cater 

to residents’ needs. 

Prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 

pandemic, activities such as sports, 

games and singing contests were organised 

at the dormitories to engage residents. 

However, many of these activities had 

to be suspended due to the pandemic. 

Full-time counsellors are also available 

at the dormitories to support our workers 

and ensure their mental and emotional 

well-being. Workers also have access to 

a 24-hour helpline where they may seek 

assistance in their native languages.

In 2020, during the periods when all 

migrant worker dormitories across 

Singapore were locked down to contain 





Residents were provided with free mobile SIM cards with 50GB of data to access entertainment and communicate 

with family and friends during the migrant worker dormitory lock down in 2020.

The Acacia Lodge dormitory includes many facilities and amenities including an on-site supermarket where migrant 

workers can purchase groceries and daily essentials.





Migrant workers are housed in dormitories such as the Acacia Lodge dormitory, which is managed by Keppel Housing,  

a wholly owned subsidiary of Keppel O&amp;M.

Dormitories by Keppel Housing offer a range of amenities and sports facilities such as basketball courts and gyms.

the spread of the virus, residents were 

provided three meals a day at no cost to 

them, and free mobile SIM cards with 50GB 

of data per resident to help them access 

various forms of entertainment online and 

communicate regularly with their friends 

and family through their smart phones.

REMUNERATION, BENEFITS &amp; 

PROGRESSION

Keppel believes in investing in our foreign 

employees for the long term as they are 

an essential part of our workforce and 

contribute to the sustainability and growth 

of the Company.

Migrant workers are paid competitive 

wages, and eligible employees can enjoy 

bonuses depending on individual and 

company performance. Our migrant 

workers also enjoy comprehensive benefits 

including annual, medical and home leave 

(for them to make return trips to their home 

countries), highly subsidised medical care 

from reputable healthcare service providers, 

with each medical consultation, including 

medication, costing up to $2, as well as 

hospitalisation insurance which is paid for 

by the Company.

Keppel also provides opportunities for 

training, skills upgrading and career 

progression for our migrant workers, 

many of whom have been with the 

company for a long time and have risen 

to supervisory positions. 

FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES

Keppel is committed to fair employment 

practices. In Singapore, Keppel O&amp;M works 

only with employment agencies licensed 

by the Singapore Ministry of Manpower. 

These agencies are required to comply with 

Singapore’s Employment Agencies Act. 

In addition, as part of Keppel O&amp;M’s 

continuing efforts to enhance the  

well-being of migrant workers, Keppel O&amp;M 

wrote to its contractors and employment 

agencies in early 2021 to require them to 

abide by the Dhaka Principles for Migration 

with Dignity going forward. These are a 

set of human rights-based principles to 

enhance respect for the rights of migrant 

workers, including the provision of clear 

and transparent worker contracts, safe 

and decent living conditions, no charging 

of recruitment fees, among others.

THE COMMUNITY THROUGH PROGRAMMES 

THAT MAKE A POSITIVE IMPACT.

OVERVIEW

GRI 103-1

Keppel aims to deliver lasting social, 

economic and environmental benefits 

to the communities where we operate. 

In engaging and nurturing communities, 

we contribute to building a sustainable 

future together.

We invest in worthy causes that resonate 

with the Company’s values. These include 

caring for the underprivileged, empowering 

lives through education, protecting the 

environment, and nurturing creativity 

and an appreciation for the arts among 

children and youths.

As leaders in our industries, we also 

support thought leadership platforms 

which inform policy-making, promote 

sustainable business practices 

and foster collaboration among 

different sectors.

In 2020, Keppel Corporation was 

conferred the Community Spirit Platinum 

Award by the Community Chest 

and the title of Champion of Good by 

the National Volunteer &amp; Philanthropy 

Centre in recognition of Keppel’s

included Singapore International Water Week, 

the R.I.S.E. to the Challenge outreach programme 

and the SID Directors Conference.

In 2020, the Group spent $9.6 million1 

on social investments.

Beyond philanthropic giving, Keppel 

encourages employees to be responsible 

citizens. Keppel Volunteers, the Company’s 

volunteer movement, works closely with 

the foundation to drive volunteerism. 

To encourage volunteerism, Keppel grants 

employees two days of volunteer leave 

annually. In 2020, Keppel Volunteers around 

the world achieved over 10,000 hours2 of 

community service, despite challenges 

posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Keppel Volunteers organise roadshows and 

talks for employees across the Group to 

recruit volunteers and raise awareness on 

volunteering opportunities. The Group has 

also designated August as its Community 

Month to further promote volunteerism. 

Volunteers are recognised for their 

contributions at an annual appreciation 

event held in conjunction with International 

Volunteer Day, which is attended by 

senior management.

In 2019, Keppel conducted a survey to 

better understand the causes which its 

employees most identify with. The survey 

results validated that our focus areas of 

care for the underprivileged, education 

and environmental protection are closely 

aligned with employees’ aspirations.

We maximise our corporate giving outcomes 

by partnering businesses and the community. 

For example, charity sales, donation drives and 

environmental campaigns are held at the 

lobbies of our commercial buildings to engage 

tenants, employees and members of the public.

In Singapore, our business units have 

been strong partners of Community Chest’s 

SHARE, a voluntary employee payroll 

donation programme. Employees of 

the Keppel Group have contributed over 

$3.1 million through SHARE since 1988.

Under the Keppel Group Donations &amp; 

Sponsorships Policy, no donations or 

sponsorships may be made to any 

political party or politicians for any 

campaign and/or related purposes. 

In reporting on our social impact, Keppel 

applies the Business for Societal Impact 

(B4SI) Framework (formerly known as LBG). 

Corporate Citizenship, as managers of the 

B4SI, has assured the data in this section. 

Our B4SI Framework Assurance Statement 

for 2020 can be found on page 99. 

Keppel has committed over $5 million to 

provide support to communities affected 

by the pandemic in Singapore and overseas. 

This includes a $4.2 million package to 

support vulnerable communities, which was 

funded by voluntary contributions from 

Keppel Group’s directors, senior management 

and staff with matching contributions 

from Keppel Corporation. Beneficiaries 

included over 55,000 lower-income 

households in 1 and 2-room HDB flats 

who were given rebates through M1, 

Keppel Electric and City Gas, frontline staff 

within and beyond the Keppel Group, and 

other communities affected by COVID-19. 

Recognising the challenging environment 

faced by many Small and Medium 

Enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore, Keppel 

also improved payment terms to SMEs 

to help improve their cashflow over a 

six-month period in 2020.

Keppel contributed a total of $600,000 

to The Courage Fund to support relief 

schemes for communities in Singapore 

affected by COVID-19. At the start of 

the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group, 

through Keppel Land China, also made 

a RMB 3 million donation to the Shanghai 

Charity Foundation, one of the largest 

charity foundations in China, to support 

the deployment of medical teams from 

Shanghai and the provision of medical 

and other supplies to Hubei Province 

and other affected regions in China. 

Our volunteers in Singapore and 

overseas supported communities in 

fighting the COVID-19 pandemic in 

various ways. In Singapore, volunteers 

packed and delivered care packs 

containing hygiene items for vulnerable 

groups such as seniors and low-income 

families with young children living in 

rental blocks. In view of COVID-19 

restrictions, Keppel also took to digital 

platforms to engage beneficiaries 

virtually, to provide support and prevent 

social isolation in the midst of the 

pandemic. Such activities ranged from 

interactive game sessions for persons 

with muscular dystrophy, to art and 

cooking classes for seniors.

Volunteers in Shanghai delivered masks 

to hospitals in Shanghai and the Shanghai 

Pudong New District’s Centre for Disease 

Control and Prevention. Over in the 

Philippines, volunteers painted social 

distancing lines along public sidewalks 

and various other locations to strengthen 

safe management measures by the 

government, while volunteers in Brazil, 

Indonesia and Malaysia also donated and 

delivered food supplies to communities 

affected by the pandemic.

Since its inception in 2012, Keppel Care 

Foundation has disbursed over $21 million 

to educational causes, which include 

scholarships and bursaries for students 

of local universities and institutes of 

higher learning.

SCHOLARSHIPS AND BURSARIES

In 2018, we made a $10 million 

commitment to the ITE Education Fund 

to promote education for financially 

disadvantaged students from ITE. In 2020,  

the second tranche of Keppel Care Foundation  

Scholarships were awarded to three 

deserving ITE students, and the inaugural 

Keppel Merit Awards were presented 

to 39 students. 

In total, 137 academic awards and 

bursaries funded by Keppel Care 

Foundation were disbursed to students 

across different institutions in 2020, 

bringing the tally to 683 till date.

KEY PARTNERS

Institute of Technical Education

“The Keppel Care Foundation scholarship has made 

tremendous changes in my life and helped me cope with 

my struggles as a student. It has enabled me to focus 

more on my studies and look toward a future career. 

Before this, it was very hard to even have a proper meal as 

I had to work to support my single handicapped mother 

with her medical bills. I am working hard in my studies now 

and strive to be a better person. I hope to contribute 

back to the community to the best of my ability in future.”

NANDINI CHANDRA, Keppel Care Foundation scholarship recipient who graduated from 

Higher Nitec in Marine Engineering in 2021 at ITE and has progressed to Singapore Polytechnic

“I would like to express 

my heartfelt thanks 

for being awarded 

the Keppel Bursary. 

My education at SUTD 

has allowed me to witness 

firsthand the positive 

impact that engineering 

and automation can bring 

to our daily lives. I have 

been inspired to carve 

a career in this field, 

and contribute towards 

developing new innovations 

to improve lives.”

QUEK JIAN WEI, a Keppel Bursary 

recipient and recent Engineering Product 

Development graduate of Singapore 

University of Technology and Design

Starting from 2021, the Medals will be 

awarded to the top graduating students of 

NTU’s Bachelor of Science in Environmental 

Earth Systems Science.

In 2020, Keppel Land Vietnam launched 

a partnership with Tien Phong Newspaper, 

a government media outlet, in support 

of the Nang Buoc Thu Khoa scholarship 

programme. The inaugural batch of 

scholarships were awarded to 15 students 

who were valedictorians of the 2020 

university entrance exams.

Our bursaries provide students from 

disadvantaged backgrounds with access 

to quality education.

MOBILE LIBRARY

In Vietnam, Keppel Land is also a sponsor of the 

Words on Wheels mobile library programme, 

which is organised by the Singapore International 

Foundation. The initiative promotes reading 

and learning by providing students with better 

access to educational materials including 

books, the internet and multimedia facilities 

via a mobile library which visits participating 

schools on a rotational basis. Although 

volunteer trips to the primary schools in 

Ho Chi Minh City were suspended in 2020 due 

to COVID-19, the mobile library reached over 

5,000 students in 11 schools. Over the year, 

the mobile library van as well as libraries 

in seven schools in Ho Chi Minh City were 

also refurbished under the programme.

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT

STRATEGIC PILLAR: PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY


CARING FOR THE UNDERPRIVILEGED 

We work closely with partners and 

social organisations to support the most 

vulnerable communities and improve 

their well-being.

SHELTERED WORKSHOP 

In 2019, Keppel pledged $500,000 over 

three years to support the Sheltered 

Workshop programme run by SPD, a local 

charity supporting persons with disabilities. 

The SPD Sheltered Workshop supported 

by Keppel aims to help persons with 

disabilities improve their employability 

through providing vocational training, 

therapy and employment support services. 

Apart from financial support, Keppel also 

brings the Group’s capabilities in areas such 

as engineering, workplace safety, business 

development and marketing to enhance 

the Sheltered Workshop programme 

through skills-based volunteerism.

Over the course of 2020, Keppel Young 

Leaders supported SPD in conducting 

market research towards developing new 

commercially-appealing products for the 

Sheltered Workshop. SPD, assisted by 

Keppel, also selected a training consultant 

specialising in training persons with 

disabilities to implement a new apprenticeship 

programme that would equip trainees 

with the skills to craft the new leather 

products. The partnership has since trained 

15 new artisans in leather crafting and  

aims to upskill more trainees by end-2021. 

On 3 December 2020, on the occasion of the 

United Nations’ International Day of Persons 

with Disabilities, SPD launched a new online 



At the signing ceremony for Keppel Corporation’s new two-year programme in Yunnan, Keppel Volunteers 

engaged students from rural communities in Yunnan. Mr Ben Lee (left), President of Keppel Land China and COO of 

Keppel Land, engaged students in a cake decorating activity.

POVERTY ALLEVIATION IN CHINA

In 2018, Keppel committed RMB 5 million 

to the China Foundation for Poverty 

Alleviation (CFPA), to launch the Working 

Together for a Brighter Future programme 

that seeks to enhance the nutritional 

content of meals for students, as well as 

provide educational and facility upgrades 

for the schools. The collaboration began 

with a three-year programme focused 

on needy students from 10 schools in 

Mabian County, Sichuan Province. 

Building on the success of the 

collaboration in Sichuan Province, 

Keppel launched a further two-year 

programme in December 2020 focused 

on needy students from 20 schools in 

Guangnan and Luquan Counties in Yunnan 

Province. This new programme, which is 

part of the same partnership with CFPA, 

will also fund the upgrading of kitchen 

facilities in the selected schools and 

provide students with nutritious food items 

every school day. Beyond financial support, 

Keppel staff will also volunteer to encourage 

active learning by the students as part 

of the programme. For more information, 

please refer to page 89.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

We work closely with partners to lead 

initiatives that conserve biodiversity 

and promote climate action.

KEPPEL DISCOVERY WETLANDS

Established with a $2.08 million contribution 

from Keppel, the Keppel Discovery Wetlands 

at the Singapore Botanic Gardens includes 

store and a range of leather products 

crafted by artisans from SPD’s Sheltered 

Workshop. The launches were supported by 

Keppel, who contributed towards enhanced 

marketing and branding efforts for the 

leather products. Sales of the workshop’s 

products have increased by over 50% 

since the launch of the new online store.

The enhancements aim to support the 

Sheltered Workshop to stay relevant and 

economically viable in the long-term.

NKF DIALYSIS CENTRE  

SUPPORTED BY KEPPEL

Keppel contributed $2 million to support 

the launch of a new NKF Dialysis Centre, 

the first in Singapore to be integrated 

within a hospital compound, being 

strategically co-located within Yishun 

Community Hospital and adjacent to 

Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, allowing for 

timely and seamless transfer of patients 

from one setting to another to facilitate 

ease of access to care and services.

It is also the first of NKF’s centres to offer 

fully integrated and seamless dialysis care 

for both haemodialysis and peritoneal 

dialysis (PD) patients. 

The centre, which commenced operations 

in November 2020, is equipped with 

22 dialysis stations which can benefit up 

to 132 haemodialysis patients weekly, 

and has a designated space to provide 

PD services which can serve an average 

of up to 20 PD patients a month. For more

of birds and 10 species of frogs and terrapins. 

Employees who participated in the training 

reported improved knowledge on flora and 

fauna in the wetlands as well as enhanced 

presentation skills.

TREE PLANTING

Keppel is committed to climate action 

and reducing our environmental impact. 

To this end, Keppel has pledged to donate 

$3 million to National Parks Board’s (NParks) 

Garden City Fund to support the planting 

of 10,000 trees in parks and nature reserves 

over the next five years, as part of NParks’ 

OneMillionTrees movement. NParks 

announced in March 2020 that this was 

the single largest donation pledged for tree 

planting in Singapore at the time. Keppel’s 

contribution will help improve Singapore’s 

urban environment and enhance its national 

resilience towards climate change.

Separately, in 2020, Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine 

also organised a tree planting initiative 

which saw 4,300 trees and shrubs planted 

across five of its yards in Singapore.

FOSTERING CREATIVITY &amp; 

APPRECIATION OF THE ARTS 

We believe that the arts inspire, contribute 

towards civic engagement and social 

cohesion, and build bridges between 

cultures. Through supporting the arts, 

we aim to stimulate the cross-fertilisation of 

ideas, and foster creativity and expression. 

This will in turn contribute to the vibrancy 

of our communities.

KEPPEL CENTRE FOR ART EDUCATION

Established with a $12 million donation 

from Keppel, the Keppel Centre for 

Art Education at National Gallery Singapore 

is the first art education facility of its kind 

in the region. The Centre has hosted over 

1.9 million visitors since its launch in 2015. 

Notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic, 

the Centre received over 120,000 visitors 

in 2020.

As part of the Singapore Ministry of Education’s 

museum-based learning programme, 

students visit National Gallery Singapore to 

learn about Singapore art and artists. Due to 

safe management measures related to the 

COVID-19 pandemic, schools suspended 

outside-school activities for the most of 2020. 

However, the Gallery offered virtual tours 

and reached out to over 10,000 students to 

ensure continuity in museum-based learning.

The Art Playscape and Children’s Museum 

at the Keppel Centre for Art Education 

were refreshed with new and exciting 

exhibits in 2020. ‘My INK-credible Adventure’ 

trained to promote conservation by regularly 

leading public tours at the Learning Forest. 

Our volunteers also facilitate craft workshops 

for children on wetland habitats. Many of 

such activities were put on hold in 2020 due 

to the pandemic.

Plants of conservation importance, such as 

Alstonia spatulata and the critically endangered 

Radermachera quadripinnata, have been 

a plant collection of over 200 species, 

allowing visitors to enjoy a restored 

freshwater forest wetland in the heart of 

the city. 

About 1.3 million people have visited the 

Learning Forest, which the Keppel Discovery 

Wetlands is a part of, since its launch in 

March 2017, with over 200,000 visitors in 

2020. Keppel’s Green Ambassadors are

where children respond to kinetic and sound 

sensors to create colourful brushstrokes 

that appear on the interactive screens 

to create a spectrum of ever-changing 

abstract compositions. Separately, children 

are encouraged to discover unusual 

painting tools such as tree branches, 

piping bags and remote-controlled cars, 

and observe robots that move and 

create abstract paintings at the refreshed 

Children’s Museum.

Educators have shared that the immersive

and self-led exploration in children, and help 

to improve students’ visual inquiry skills. 

The programmes offered at the Centre 

also promote familial bonding.

KEPPEL NIGHTS 

Keppel Corporation committed $500,000, 

from 2018 to 2020, to Keppel Nights, 

a partnership with Esplanade – Theatres on 

the Bay to nurture a deeper appreciation of 

the arts among students in Singapore. Due 

to the COVID-19 pandemic, programmes for 

students at the Esplanade were suspended 

for the most part of 2020, but they will 

resume as the pandemic situation improves. 

The partnership, which has been in place 

since 2013, has provided more than 

28,000 students from more than 75 schools

ENHANCING ACCESS  

TO HEALTHCARE

support of the Keppel Group, without 

which this centre would not have 

been possible.

“There are many unique features about 

this centre. Firstly, this is our first centre 

co-located within both acute and 

community hospitals, namely KTPH 

and YCH. This strategic co-location and 

partnership enables the timely and seamless 

transfer of patients from one setting to 

another to facilitate ease of access to 

care and services. Patients do not need 

to travel to other centres for dialysis. 

Patients discharged from KTPH who require 

rehabilitation can have their dialysis at 

the centre in YCH, under the same roof. 

Patients will benefit from the seamless 

continuity of care through connected 

networks of healthcare teams, information 

flow and treatment care plans.

“Secondly, this is the first NKF centre 

offering both HD and PD services under 

one roof. Unlike the other centres of 

NKF which only cater for HD patients, this 

centre provides comprehensive services 

to support patients who choose PD as 

their preferred modality of treatment,” 

said Mr Oei.

Mr Loh Chin Hua, CEO of Keppel Corporation, 

said, “Keppel is committed to uplift lives 

and care for the underprivileged. Our 

support of the NKF Dialysis Centre at 

Yishun Community Hospital will enhance 

the accessibility of integrated healthcare 

for dialysis patients and improve their 

quality of life. The COVID-19 pandemic 

has had an immense impact on society, 

especially vulnerable members of the 

community, including dialysis patients. 

Through this partnership, Keppel hopes 

to support NKF in ensuring that its patients 

are able to receive safe and convenient 

dialysis treatment.”

Beyond Keppel’s financial support, 

Keppel’s staff volunteers have also been 

actively involved with NKF since 2017, 

with more than 160 volunteers engaging 

patients in befriending sessions and 

delivering ‘joy bundles’ containing food 

provisions, care items and necessities. 

Together, their efforts have touched 

the lives of close to 600 NKF patients 

to date.

The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) opened 

a new dialysis centre on 23 November 2020 

with a $2 million donation from Keppel 

Corporation, provided through its philanthropic 

arm, Keppel Care Foundation. The dialysis 

centre is the first in Singapore to be 

integrated within a hospital compound, 

being strategically co-located within Yishun 

Community Hospital (YCH) and adjacent to 

Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH). It is also 

the first of NKF’s centres to offer fully 

integrated and seamless dialysis care for 

both haemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal 

dialysis (PD) patients.

Equipped with 22 dialysis stations which 

can benefit up to 132 HD patients, this 

centre also has a designated space to 

provide PD services to serve a wider 

group of patients compared to other 

NKF centres. Offering both treatment 

services under one roof will enable NKF 

to meet the ever evolving and diverse 

care needs of patients.

Mr Tim Oei, CEO of NKF said, “This centre 

is made possible with a generous donation 

of $2 million from Keppel Care Foundation. 

We are very grateful for the strong

A BRIGHTER FUTURE  

FOR CHILDREN

Keppel committed RMB 5 million to the  

China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation 

(CFPA) in 2018 to launch the Working 

Together for a Brighter Future programme 

that seeks to enhance the nutritional 

content of meals for students, as well as 

provide educational and facility upgrades 

for the schools. The collaboration began 

with a three-year programme focused 

on needy students from 10 schools in 

Mabian County, Sichuan Province. 

In conceiving its community outreach 

programme in Mabian, Keppel had 

consulted the local education bureau to 

ensure that the aid provided would be 

suitable and impactful. 

Through Keppel’s contribution, over 

2,100 students are provided with milk 

every school day. In 2020, kitchens in the 

remote village schools in Mabian County 

completed their upgrades, allowing more 

than 1,300 students aged three to 16 

to enjoy well-balanced and nutritious 

hot school meals, made possible by 

industrial-grade kitchen equipment like 

electric stoves, rice steamers and water 

heaters. Over 2,400 students have also 

benefitted from digital library resources 

sponsored by Keppel.

Under the same partnership, Keppel 

launched a further two-year programme in 

Keppel and the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation’s partnership aims to enhance nutritional content of meals for students, as well as provide educational and facility upgrades 

for the schools. 



December 2020 focused on needy students 

from 20 schools in Guangnan and Luquan 

Counties in Yunnan Province. This further 

supports the Chinese government’s plans to 

uplift rural communities and stimulate the 

development of remote regions. Similar to 

the programme in Mabian County, this new 

programme will also fund the upgrading 

of kitchen facilities in the schools. In addition, 

Keppel staff will also volunteer to encourage 

active learning by the students, as part of 

the programme.

Mr Eric Goh, Chief Representative (China) 

of Keppel Corporation, said, “Keppel seeks 

to do good, wherever we operate. We are 

pleased to partner the China Foundation for 

Poverty Alleviation to contribute to uplifting 

rural communities in Yunnan Province, where 

Keppel has been operating since the 1990s.”

Mr Zheng Wenkai, Chairman of the CFPA, said, 

“Since 2018, we have been collaborating with 

the Keppel Group to support the education 

and nutrition of students in rural areas of 

Sichuan Province, and we are happy to 

kickstart this new programme in Yunnan 

Province. I believe that this launch will signify 

a new journey and starting point to consolidate 

and further the achievements in terms 

of poverty alleviation, and make greater 

contributions towards rural revitalisation.”

Inclusive, quality education can lift communities out 

of poverty, and Keppel is supporting rural communities 

in China to enable students to create brighter futures 

for themselves and their families.

Sustainability Report 2020

OTHER INFORMATION

GRI CONTENT INDEX


DNV Business Assurance Singapore Pte. Ltd. has been commissioned by the management of Keppel Corporation Ltd. (“Keppel”,  

Company Registration Number: 196800351N) to carry out an independent assurance of the sustainability/non-financial disclosures 

in Keppel Corporation Sustainability Report 2020 (the “Report”), which is available on Keppel’s website1 and its printed format for 

the financial year ending 31 December 2020. The intended users of this Assurance Statement are the management of the Company. 

STAKEHOLDER INCLUSIVENESS

The Report brings out the Company’s 

relationships with its key stakeholders who 

affect operations and influence performance 

ie. regulators, customers, employees, suppliers, 

local communities, shareholders and investors. 

The Report brings out the channels and 

initiatives that the Company has established 

to engage with identified stakeholders and 

Keppel’s responses to these key concerns 

through various disclosures on strategies 

and other platforms and mechanisms.

Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that 

the Report does not meet the requirements related 

to the Principle of Stakeholder Inclusiveness. 

MATERIALITY 

The Report brings out Keppel’s process for 

identification and prioritisation of the Company’s 

material matters. This is based on global 

environmental, social and governance (ESG) 

standards and considers ESG issues that 

could result in significant impacts on 

communities, business partners, workforce 

and the environment, and the relative 

influence on stakeholders’ assessment and 

decision making. The material matters 

identified were further validated through 

stakeholder engagements conducted 

remotely during the year. The material 

topics identified were approved by 

Keppel Corporation’s Board of Directors.

Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that 

the Report does not meet the requirements related 

to the Principle of Materiality. 

RESPONSIVENESS 

Responses to identified material topics and 

significant issues which have arisen during 

the reporting period are addressed through 

disclosures on strategies, management 

approach, long and short-term targets. 

Further, the Report also brings out its 

non-financial performance related to its 

material topics through selected GRI 

Topic-Specific Standards. The Report considers 

the risks, opportunities and outcomes 

associated with significant stakeholders 

and the external environment and brings out 

the implications and mitigation mechanisms 

deployed by the Company to maintain its 

ability to create value on the long term. 

 

Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that 

the Report does not meet the requirements related 

to the Principle of Responsiveness.  

OUR OBSERVATIONS

Without affecting our assurance opinion, we also provide the following observations against 

the principles of VeriSustainTM:

RELIABILITY

The majority of the performance disclosures 

verified through offsite verification, i.e. Head 

Office and sampled sites, and through desk 

reviews, were found to be fairly accurate, 

reliable, identifiable and traceable to the source. 

Considering the limited sampling, we did 

not detect any major errors related to data 

collection or aggregation. Some of the data 

inaccuracies identified during the verification 

process were found to be attributable to 

interpretation and aggregation errors. These 

identified errors were communicated, and 

the responses and corrections made to the 

reported data and information were reviewed. 

Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that 

the Report does not meet the requirements related 

to the Principle of Reliability. 

COMPLETENESS 

The Report has disclosed its business model, 

sustainability strategies, management 

approach disclosures and sustainability 

performances against the material topics 

identified based on chosen GRI Standards. 

The boundary of the Report has been explained 

across sections in the Report and includes 

the sustainability performance from the global 

operations, subsidiaries and associated 

companies over which the Keppel Group has 

management control for the reporting period.

Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that 

the Report does not meet the requirements related 

to the Principle of Completeness. 

NEUTRALITY 

The Report presents disclosures related to 

the Company’s performance, challenges 

and concerns of stakeholders during the 

reporting period in a neutral, consistent 

and balanced manner, applying adequate 

consideration to not unduly influence 

stakeholders’ assessments made based 

on the reported data and information. 

Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that 

the Report does not meet the requirements related 

to the Principle of Neutrality. 

STANDARD AND SCOPE OF 

ASSURANCE

STANDARD

The assurance is in accordance with 

International Standard on Assurance 

Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Revised2 

and Reporting Principles from the 

GRI Standards on Defining Report 

Content and Quality, and was 

performed using DNV’s assurance 

methodology VeriSustainTM 3. 

The verification engagement was 

carried out from March to May 2021. 

SCOPE OF ASSURANCE

We understand that the reported 

financial data and related information 

are based on statutory disclosures and 

audited financial statements4, which 

are subject to a separate independent 

statutory audit process. We did not 

review financial disclosures and data 

as they are not within the scope of our 

assurance engagement.

We planned and performed our work 

to obtain the evidence we considered 

necessary to provide a basis for our 

assurance opinion related to assurance 

of non-financial sustainability disclosures 

in this Report. We are providing a 

‘limited level’ of assurance based on 

ISAE 3000 and VeriSustainTM.

The engagement excludes the 

sustainability management, performance, 

and reporting practices of Keppel 

Corporation’s suppliers, contractors, 

and any third parties mentioned in 

the Report. The Company’s position 

statements, the statements for the 

management approach, and case 

studies and examples are excluded 

from the scope of our work.

CONCLUSION

On the basis of the limited assurance 

engagement undertaken, nothing has 

come to our attention to suggest that 

Keppel Corporation’s 2020 Sustainability 

Report does not properly describe 

the non-financial/sustainability 

performance of identified material 

topics based on the GRI Standards 

Core option of reporting, for the 

reporting period.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE 

MANAGEMENT OF KEPPEL AND  

OF THE ASSURANCE PROVIDER

Keppel has sole responsibility for 

the preparation of the Report and is 

responsible for all information provided 

in the Report as well as the processes 

for collecting, analysing and reporting 

the information presented in the Report. 

DNV is responsible for planning and 

performing the engagement to obtain 

|a limited level of assurance based on 

ISAE 3000 and VeriSustainTM, i.e. whether 

the reported disclosures are free 

from material misstatements and 

meet disclosure requirements of the 

GRI Standards 2016 and selected 

topic-specific disclosures related to 

identified material topics from the 

GRI Standards 2016 and selected 

GRI Standards (2018 and 2020), in 

accordance with the Core option 

of reporting.

The DNV Code of Conduct is available from 

the DNV website (www.dnv.com).

BASIS OF OUR OPINION

We planned and performed our work to obtain 

the evidence considered necessary to provide 

a basis for our assurance opinion as part of 

the assurance engagement. We adopted a 

risk-based approach, i.e. we concentrated our 

verification efforts on the issues of high 

material relevance to Keppel Corporation and 

its key stakeholders. A multi-disciplinary team 

of sustainability and assurance specialists 

reviewed non-financial disclosures related to 

the Head Office at Singapore, and selected 

sites of Keppel Corporation – Keppel Land 

and Keppel Capital in Singapore, based on 

DNV’s sampling plan. Due to the outbreak of 

the COVID-19 pandemic, we carried out remote 

assessments as one-to-one discussions and 

onsite location assessments were not 

feasible. We undertook the following activities: 

• Review of the non-financial/sustainability 

disclosures in this Report.

• Review of approach to materiality 

determination and stakeholder engagement 

and recent outputs although DNV did not have any 

direct engagement with external stakeholders.

• Review of information provided to us by the 

Company on its reporting and management 

processes related to sustainability 

performance for the reporting year based on 

the reporting framework adopted by Keppel.

• Interviews with selected members of 

leadership team, and senior managers 

responsible for management of sustainability 

issues and review of selected evidence to 

support issues discussed. We were free to 

choose interviewees and interviewed those 

with overall responsibility for the programmes 

to deliver the targets for medium- and 

long-term vision, mission and milestones.

• Performed desk review of selected 

sustainability parameters for sampled entities, 

and findings were discussed and resolved 

with the corporate sustainability team.

• Carried out remote assessments with teams 

at Keppel Land and Keppel Capital, to review 

the processes and systems for preparing 

site level sustainability data and the 

implementation of Keppel’s sustainability 

strategy. We were free to choose the sites 

for remote assessment or verification.

• Review of supporting evidence for key 

claims and data disclosed in the Report. 

Our verification processes were prioritised 

based on our risk-based approach, i.e. 

relevance of identified material topics and 

sustainability context of the business.

• Review of the processes for gathering and 

consolidating the performance data and, 

for a sample, checking the data 

consolidation at site and corporate levels.

LIMITATION

DNV’s assurance engagements are based 

on the assumption that the data and 

information provided by the Company to us 

as part of our review have been provided 

in good faith, true, and free from material 

misstatements. Because of the selected 

nature (sampling) and other inherent 

limitation of both procedures and systems 

of internal control, there remains the 

unavoidable risk that errors or irregularities, 

possibly significant, may not have been 

detected. DNV was not involved in the 

preparation of any statement or datum 

included in the Report except for this 

Assurance Statement. DNV expressly 

disclaims any liability or co-responsibility 

for any decision a person or an entity may 

make based on this Assurance Statement.

Our verification engagement included 

limited level of verification of sustainability 

performance disclosures for the identified 

material topics of Keppel Corporation as 

identified under the reporting boundary brought 

out in the Report in the section “Materiality” 

ie. covering entities over which Keppel 

Corporation has operational control or has 

seconded employees in operations. Our 

verification applies a ±5% uncertainty threshold 

towards errors and omissions for the 

performance data brought out in the Report.

The procedures performed in a limited 

assurance engagement vary in nature and 

timing and are less in extent than for a 

reasonable/high level assurance engagement. 

During the assurance process, we did not 

come across limitations to the scope of 

the agreed assurance engagement. 

Statement of Competence and Independence

DNV applies its own management standards 

and compliance policies for quality control, 

in accordance with ISO/IEC 17021:2015 – 

Conformity Assessment Requirements for bodies 

providing audit and certification of management 

systems, and accordingly maintains a 

comprehensive system of quality control 

including documented policies and procedures 

regarding compliance with ethical requirements, 

professional standards, and applicable legal and 

regulatory requirements. We have complied with 

the DNV Code of Conduct5 during the assurance 

engagement and maintain independence 

wherever required by relevant ethical requirements. 

This engagement work was carried out by an 

independent team of sustainability assurance 

professionals. DNV was not involved in the 

preparation of any statement or datum included 

in the Report except for this Assurance Statement. 

DNV maintains complete impartiality toward 

internal stakeholders interviewed during the 

assurance process. DNV did not provide any 

services to Keppel in 2020 that could compromise 

the independence or impartiality of our work.

has operational control. During the process 

of verification, we did not come across any 

limitations to the agreed scope of work.

VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY

The verification was conducted by DNV 

in accordance with the requirements set out 

in DNV VeriSustainTM, for a moderate level 

of verification. As part of the verification 

process, we obtained an understanding of 

the systems used to generate, aggregate 

and report GHG emission data, and the 

GHG data management system of Keppel. 

We also tested the Completeness, Accuracy 

and Reliability of the data.

SCOPE, BOUNDARY AND 

LIMITATIONS OF VERIFICATION

The scope of work agreed upon with 

Keppel includes the following:

• Verification of the GHG emissions  

(Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3) in 

accordance with the requirements of CDP:

 – The Scope 1 emissions arising from:

a. diesel consumption in the diesel 

generating (DG) sets owned or 

operated by Keppel;

b. diesel fuel consumption in owned 

and leased vehicles of Keppel; 

c. liquefied petroleum gas consumption;

d. naphtha consumption;

e. piped natural gas consumption;

f. compressed natural gas consumption;

g. acetylene consumption; and

h. refrigerant consumption – R123, 

R134A, R22, R407C, R410A

 – The Scope 2 emissions arising from 

use of purchased electricity;

 – The Scope 3 emissions arising from 

a consequence of the activities of the 

Company but occurring from sources 

not owned or controlled by the Company, 

such as business travel2 and equity 

investment companies3. For carbon 

emissions calculation under Scope 3 

emissions, Keppel Corporation accounts 

for the proportional emissions of 

1 

The VeriSustainTM protocol is available on www.dnv.com

For details please refer Keppel Corporations Sustainability report page 30. The data was verified from CR360 software, used by Keppel Corporation.

5 

Scope 3 emissions for equity investment companies which generate incineration waste, estimated based on the fossil carbon arising from the incineration of non-organic 

waste content in the incineration plant which is dry plastics in Singapore’s context. Including water treatment emissions, generation of industrial waste through recycling, 

waste generated for landfill. 

Keppel has considered carbon emission factors to be: one tonne of waste incinerated equals to 0.3139 tCO2 for Keppel Seghers Tuas WTE Plant, and 0.4283 tCO2 for 

Senoko WTE Plant. ICAO Carbon Emissions Calculator or Carbon footprint carbon calculator used for business travel (Scope 3 emissions).

CONCLUSION

On the basis of our verification 

methodology, nothing has come to 

our attention that would cause us not 

to believe that the GHG assertions 

below are not a fair representation of 

Keppel’s GHG Scope 1, Scope 2 and 

Scope 3 emission assertions. Some 

data inaccuracies identified for the 

sampled sites, during the verification 

process were found to be attributable 

to transcription, interpretation and 

aggregation errors, and the errors 

have been communicated for 

correction and corrected by Keppel.

DNV Business Assurance Singapore Pte. Ltd. (‘DNV’) has been commissioned by the management of Keppel Corporation Ltd. (“Keppel”, 

Company Registration Number:196800351N) to carry out verification of Greenhouse Gases (“GHGs”) emissions assertions as part of its 

sustainability reporting and as part of the Company’s Carbon Disclosure Project (“CDP”) response. The verification exercise was carried out 

for the Company’s GHG assertions for the period from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020. This verification provides a moderate level of 

assurance as per DNV VeriSustainTM 1 and applies a ±5% uncertainty threshold towards errors and omissions.

During the verification engagement, we have 

taken a risk-based approach, and we have 

verified the GHG assertion made in the 

Report and assessed the robustness of 

the underlying data management system, 

information flow and controls. We carried 

out the following activities:

• Desk review of Keppel’s reported 

emissions provided to us in spreadsheets 

to select sample sites for offsite 

verification including offset purchase and 

the certification related to zero energy 

building by the Building and Construction 

Authority BCA, Singapore;

• Management interaction to review 

data management systems of Keppel 

including review of data completeness, 

emission factors used and assumptions 

applied (data related to (from grid, DG), 

diesel consumption in DG sets owned or 

operated by Keppel and, diesel 

consumption in owned/leased vehicles, 

consumption of liquefied petroleum gas, 

naphtha, piped natural gas, compressed 

natural gas and acetylene and refrigerant 

usage (R123, R134A, R22, R407C, R410A) 

for its operations, and business travel;

• Offsite verification of data aggregation 

systems and related evidences related to 

Scope 1 emissions, Scope 2 emissions 

reported for sample locations at 

Keppel Land, Keppel Shipyard and

OTHER INFORMATION

INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION STATEMENT


Corporate Citizenship is a global consulting firm which specialises in responsible and 

sustainable business and manages the Business for Societal Impact (B4SI) Framework 

(formerly known as LBG). Corporate Citizenship has been commissioned by Keppel Corporation 

to perform independent external assurance on its use of the B4SI Framework to measure 

and report on its corporate community investment (CCI) activities, occurring between 

1 January to 31 December 2020.

The B4SI Framework helps businesses to measure, manage and report on their CCI activities. 

It moves beyond charitable donations to include the full range of contributions, or inputs, 

made to community causes (including time, in-kind and management costs, and cash 

donations). It also assesses the actual results for the community and for the business, 

also known as outputs and impacts. (See https://b4si.net/ for more information).

The purpose of our engagement has been to assess whether or not the B4SI Framework, 

and its guidance, are correctly and consistently applied by Keppel Corporation in its  

reporting. The scope of the B4SI assurance covers the information presented in the 

Community Development section of Keppel Corporation’s Sustainability Report for 2020, 

on pages 80 to 89. The scope of the assurance included the following data and KPIs:

• Inputs: e.g. Volunteer hours, donation amounts

• Outputs: e.g. Number of beneficiaries served

• Impacts: e.g. Business impacts (employee perception of company)

The engagement was undertaken at a limited level and involved the following activities:

• Checks on the accuracy and consistency of the data and information presented in 

this report on pages 80 to 89.

• Management interviews with key persons responsible for community investment activities 

to understand the process for collecting, validating and consolidating the data. This also 

included questions to verify the internal systems and procedures for collecting, validating 

and consolidating the data.

As a result of our work, we are satisfied, based on the limited scope described above, 

that Keppel Corporation has sufficiently applied the guidance set out in the B4SI Guidance 

Manual. Our work has not extended to an independent audit of the data presented 

in this report.
