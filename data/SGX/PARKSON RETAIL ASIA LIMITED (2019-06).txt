contemporary market, the Group launched its private label brands as well as agency apparel lines of 

numerous international brands which are exclusive to Parkson.

OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY 

 

Our sustainability objective is to address the economic, environmental, social and governance 

impacts, risks and opportunities stemming from our business activities to support long-term value 

creation for our stakeholders and shareholders. We are committed to monitoring our performance

MATERIALITY 

 

We have applied the relevant GRI Standards to carry out our first materiality assessment to identify 

and prioritise sustainability topics for reporting. The materiality assessment was conducted through 

a series of engagement sessions with internal stakeholders including the senior management 

executives from Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam to understand their concerns and emerging 

priorities. This keeps us agile and allows us the opportunity to initiate collaboration and be part of 

formulating or facilitating a solution.  

 

The assessment yielded nine material topics, with (i) Staff Development and Retention, (ii) Fair and 

Ethical Operating Practices; and (iii) Product, Service Excellence Quality and Customer Satisfaction, 

being the focal points for the Group. 

 

The findings of the assessment have been plotted in the materiality matrix based on their impact to 

Parkson’s business, and against their importance to both internal and external stakeholders (Figure 

1.0). 

 

 

Figure 1.0 Group Materiality Matrix 

 

 

 

The Board subsequently has reviewed, determined and approved these material topics for reporting. 

 

The ESG performance data presented in this report establishes the baseline for our material topics. 

The baseline data will help us to develop specific targets in the coming years.

SUMMARY OF ESG MATERIAL TOPICS 

 

For the purpose of the report structure and clarity, the material topics are grouped into key themes 

and categorised according to our four sustainability pillars of Environment (E), People (S), 

Community (S), and Marketplace and Customers (G), corresponding to the ESG framework.  

 

A summary of Parkson’s ESG impacts, where the impacts occur, our involvement with these impacts 

and our management approach is presented in the table below (Table 2.0). An indirect involvement 

indicates that the impacts arise outside of Parkson, where we may have limited or no control.

ENVIRONMENT 

 

CLIMATE CHANGE AND CARBON - ENERGY CONSERVATION 

 

Parkson is committed to minimising its environmental footprint impact through our energy and 

carbon reduction initiatives. Parkson’s primary environmental footprint stems from electricity 

consumption, where it is used for lighting and air-conditioning in all our department stores and 

offices. Not only is minimizing our environmental footprint in coherence with our belief of 

conducting business in a socially responsible manner, this will also benefit us financially as well by 

reducing operational costs. 

 

To align with the energy conservation objective, we began rolling out light emitting diode (“LED”) 

lights across our network of stores progressively. Compared with conventional lights, LED lights 

could contribute to 35% to 45% savings in energy consumption (measured in kilowatt hours, KWH). 

 

In addition to installation of LED lights, other energy conservation initiatives undertaken by the 

Group include optimising the usage of high energy consumption store equipment (e.g. elevators, air 

conditioners) by only switching on escalators / air conditioners closer to the commencement of store 

operating hour, and cultivation of energy-saving habits (e.g. switching off lights, air-conditioners and 

office equipment when not in use). 

 

Moving forward, we target to continue rolling out LED lights in the remaining stores, whilst 

upholding the other conservation initiatives currently in place.

PEOPLE 

At Parkson, we recognise that our success depends on our people’s commitment in delivering the 

highest levels of service to our customers. We strive to provide a fair, performance-based working 

environment that is diverse, inclusive and collaborative. 

As at 30 June 2019, Parkson employs a total of approximately 4,200 800 people – 2,6003,200 in 

Malaysia, 1,300 in Indonesia and 300 in Vietnam. Women make up 63% of our workforce. 

TALENT ATTRACTION 

 

We are committed to the principles of equality and nondiscrimination, and strive to employ on the 

basis of merit regardless of gender, age, race, religion, disability or any factors which do have 

bearing on job requirements. Our sources of talent include recruitment from the open market, as 

well as through Lion-Parkson Foundation scholarship programme. In attracting external talent, we 

strive to implement remuneration practices that are externally competitive and internally fair and 

equitable.  

Except for Vietnam wherein approximately 90% of our people are covered by collective bargaining 

agreements, our personnel in Malaysia and Indonesia are currently not part of any collective 

bargaining agreement. 

STAFF DEVELOPMENT AND RETENTION 

 

At Parkson, we provide learning and development (“L&amp;D”) opportunities in respect of technical, 

functional and behavioral competencies for our people in line with their job requirements and 

career aspirations. These opportunities can be in the form of on-the-job, formal class training and 

continuing education. 

 

For FY2019, our people achieved an average training hours of 1413, in the form of formal class 

training. Our target is to further improve the average training hours of our people in the coming 

years, so as to better equip them in serving our customers as well as in dealing with other 

stakeholders.

REWARDS AND PERFORMANCE 

 

We practicse meritocracy in assessing our people’s performance, and in providing due recognition 

for their excellence. We have put in place an objective performance appraisal policy which requires 

all permanent staff to take part in periodic performance assessment. Such regular performance 

discussions provide opportunities for us to identify development needs of our people, whilst at the 

same time allow our people to provide upward feedback on their concerns.

COMMUNITY 

 

OUR SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT  

Inclusion of Disadvantaged Community Groups (Community well-being) 

At Parkson, we believe in giving back to the communities wherein we operate to promote equal 

opportunities and to improve the lives of people – through our various programmes that we have 

established to help the underprivileged, people with special needs, and youths. 

MALAYSIA 

Empowerment through Education  

Annually, the Lion-Parkson Foundation (“Foundation”) awards scholarships to undergraduates in 

local universities. The selected scholars will then undergo training in soft skills such as problem-

solving and communication skills as well as internships at our companies during their semester 

breaks to prepare them for working in the corporate world. In FY2019, the Foundation awarded 

scholarships worth RM10,000 per annum to 9 students based on their academic performance, extra-

curricular activities and leadership qualities. Todate, the Foundation has sponsored a total of 458 

students through various sponsorship programmes worth RM10.5 million.  

For the 10th consecutive year, students from 5 schools staged calligraphy demonstrations and 

orchestra performances at 9 participating Parkson stores in the Klang Valley over 3 weekends prior 

to the 2019 Lunar New Year and successfully raised RM237,247.31 from the sale of their calligraphy 

pieces. The Lunar New Year Calligraphy Exhibition and Charity Sale in Parkson stores were initiated 

since 2010 which have raised a total of RM2,382,644 to assist needy students in these schools.  

The third Lion Parkson charity run was held on 30 September 2018 at Pavilion Kuala Lumpur and 

managed to raise RM1.2 million for education and charity, including the expansion of the Home for 

Handicapped and Mentally Disabled Children in Banting, Selangor, National Cancer Society Malaysia, 

Kasih Hospice Care Society, Kuala Lumpur and Selangor Chinese Chambers of Commerce and 


 

 

12 

 



Industry Education Fund. 45 cancer patients and survivors from National Cancer Society participated 

in the 1km Run for Cancer category.  

Home for Special Children 

In reaching out to the various communities through education, we have not forgotten the less 

fortunate, namely the special children whose lives we seek to enhance and enrich through our Home 

for Handicapped and Mentally Disabled Children in Selangor It was built at a cost of RM2.2 million 

contributed by the Foundation in 2012 on a 4.17-acre piece of land worth RM1.2 million donated by 

Lion Group which can accommodate 100 children. The Home was officially opened by National 

Shuttler, Datuk Wira Lee Chong Wei and the Foundation Chairman, Puan Sri Chelsia Cheng on 4 

November 2012. Further, construction work for the 2nd and 3rd phases which costs another RM6 

million to enable the Home to accommodate another 100 children and an old folks home have just 

been completed.  

All in, todate a total of RM38.4 million has been contributed to various charitable causes 

championed by the Foundation.  

Medical Assistance for the Less Fortunate  

In reaching out to a broad and diverse cross-section of beneficiaries irrespective of race or religion, 

the Lion Group Medical Assistance Fund (“Fund”) provides financial assistance to the less fortunate 

suffering from critical illnesses who require medical treatment including surgery as well as purchase 

of medical equipment and medication. Since its inception in 1995, the Fund has also assisted 

organisations that are geared towards helping the less fortunate to achieve a better life, including 

sponsoring community health programmes such as medical camps and donation of dialysis 

machines.  

Todate, approximately RM8.9 million has been disbursed in the form of sponsorship for medical 

treatment to 948 individuals, purchase of equipment and medication including medicine for medical 

camps as well as purchase of 22 dialysis machines worth RM839,400 for Dialysis Centres operated by 

National Kidney Foundation and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to provide subsidised 

treatment to those suffering from kidney failure. 

INDONESIA 

PT Tozy Sentosa, our Indonesian subsidiary collaborated with Yayasan Difabel Mandiri Indonesia 

(“YDMI”) for the “We Care Program – Peduli Anak Bangsa” project to help people with disabilities to 

develop their entrepreneurship skills,  and  presented Rp103,095,000, to YDMI to build  fish farms 

and a training centre  in Tangerang, Banten Province. From the total  amount, Rp93,095,000 was the  

proceeds from the  selling  of coupons for Rp10,000 each  in 14 stores nationwide from April 2018 to 

mid-August 2018, whilst Rp10,000,000  was contributed by PT Tozy Sentosa. 

 

We strongly believe in engaging and giving back to communities in the markets that we operate in. 

From October 2018 to June 2019, our Centro Parkson stores distributed rice packs and basic 

necessities to the needy in their vicinities. Centro department store employees also  chipped in and 

raised Rp34,050,000 for  ‘Qurban’ for the less fortunate. The event was held by Centro Margo City, 

Centro Solo Paragon and Centro Manado Town Square on 21 August 2018 and Centro Plaza 

Ambarukmo on 31 August 2018.

PT Tozy Sentosa also contributes to the country’s humanitarian efforts through its close 

collaboration with Indonesian Red Cross and held  several  blood donation drives at Parkson Centre 

Point Medan on 3 and 4 August 2018; Centro Bintaro Xchange, South Tangerang on 22 December 

2018 and Parkson Lippo Mall Puri @The St. Moritz, Jakarta on 16 February 2019. These donation 

drives collected a total of 212 bags of blood, which can essentially save many precious lives. 

 

At an event held by Centro Margo City  on 5 October 2018, 20 orphans benefited from its 

department store donation  drive and received school essential packages totaling  Rp 12,000,000 

whilst  Centro Solo Paragon distributed  school essential packages, biscuits, milk, toys and medicines 

worth Rp3,150,000  to needy children on 9 January 2019.  

 

The  management and  employees of PT. Tozy Sentosa had also organised a donation drive and 

raised Rp44,773,000   in aid of Lombok and Palu earthquake and tsunami victims.

MARKET PLACE AND CUSTOMERS 

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND EXPERIENCE 

 

In today’s highly competitive retail market, it is imperative for us to provide the best of value and 

experience to our customers while they shop at Parkson. In achieving this, we have implemented, 

inter alia, the following: 

 

Enriching In-Store Experience 

We strive to provide wholesome shopping experience to our customers by incorporating lifestyle 

elements such as cafes, bakeries, saloons and children playgrounds in some of our stores. In 

addition, we carry out various activities such as festive celebration party, cooking class, fashion show 

and many other interesting events at our stores. These activities provide value-add to our 

customers, while at the same time serve as a platform for us to engage with and better understand 

our customers.    

In response to the growing Chinese tourist arrivals, we now accept payment via eWallet (i.e. AliPay 

and WeChat Pay) at certain stores with high tourists’ traffic. Additionally, we have put up Mandarin 

brochures and signage at these stores, and deploy Mandarin-speaking frontline personnel during the 

period with higher volume of Chinese tourists, such as the Golden Week in the first week of October. 

The acceptance of AliPay and WeChat Pay in our stores had been well received by our customers. 

Moving forward, we have plans to roll-out the acceptance of other eWallets as well in view of the 

growing popularity of such mode of payment, especially among our younger customers.   

 

Parkson Card Loyalty Programme 

We launched our Parkson Card loyalty programme in December 2014 with the objective to better 

serve our customers. Since then, Parkson Card had been rolled out to each of the country where we 

operate. As at 30 June 2019, we have a total of 3.6 million Parkson Card members from Malaysia (2.1 

million), Indonesia (1.3 million) and Vietnam (0.2 million).  

The launch of Parkson Card has enabled us to devise targeted promotions and events catering to the 

preference of our members. In addition, Parkson Card is accepted in all countries where we have 

operations, and is supported by a wide range of our merchant partners.    

To provide further convenience to members, we launched the Parkson Card mobile app in Malaysia 

since FY2018. This mobile app allows members to track their spending in Parkson, as well as to view 

offers from Parkson and our merchant partners.  

 

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

15 

 



 

Continuous Training for Servicing Personnel 

As aforementioned in the &lt;People&gt; section, we provide L&amp;D opportunities to our people in line with 

their job requirements. In the case of our frontline servicing personnel, they are required to undergo 

retraining on customer service basics and product knowledge periodically, and are encouraged to 

participate in other courses such as English language, communication, problem-solving and related 

subjects. 

These courses will certainly enhance the capabilities of our frontline personnel in delivering a better 

service to our customers at our stores.  

Customer Feedback 

We emphasise on the needs and concerns of our customers, and strive to address them in a timely 

manner upon receiving customers’ feedback from our customer care desk, email, phone calls and 

social media platforms such as Facebook in our stores. 

 

In addition, we take proactive measures to identify lapses in our service standards, such as through 

the deployment of Mystery Shopper. 

 

Customer Privacy 

As a department store operator with our Parkson Card loyalty programme, we handle significant 

amount of personal data of our customers, and recognise the importance of protecting the privacy 

of our customers. We conduct our business in compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act, 

and have measures in place to safeguard customers’ personal data. There were no breaches of 

customer data privacy in FY2019. 

 

ETHICAL AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICES 

ANTI-CORRUPTION 

 

Parkson is committed to operating our business with integrity and by adhering to ethical business 

principles. We maintain zero-tolerance for bribery, fraud and corruption. 

 

We apprise our people on the Group’s Code of Business Ethics and Conduct and the need to conduct 

business at the highest ethical standards. We do not tolerate bribery and corrupt practices or 

behaviours that may bring disrepute to the Group or its people. Above all, we expect honesty, 

integrity and respect to be exhibited in our dealings and interactions within and outside the Group. 

In this regard, we have made it mandatory for our people at or above certain grade to declare any 

conflict of interest at least once a year. 

 

We have also put in place the whistleblower policy, where we encourage our stakeholders to 

disclose suspected wrongdoings which may involve or concern our Group’s Directors, management, 

employees, performance, relations with other stakeholders, assets and reputation. Whistleblowers 

will be accorded protection of their identity unless the disclosure is required by any applicable law.

Our goal in the coming years is to increase and/or refresh the awareness on the Group’s anti-

corruption stance and ethical operating practices among our internal and external stakeholders.  

 

 

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT 

 

At Parkson, we incorporate sustainability considerations such as fair labour practices and safety 

requirements in our vendor selection process. Subsequently, all our registered vendors are required 

to acknowledge their commitments to the Vendors’ Code of Conduct periodically.  

 

The Vendors’ Code of Conduct serves to inform our vendors of their role and contribution as a key 

business partner and on the need to comply with all rules and regulations including health, safety 

and labour standards, avoid conflict of interest, conserve the environment, and notify the Group of 

any breaches or non-conformance. 

 

Parkson partners with approximately 4,200 trade vendors as at 30 June 2019;  with 1,450 in 

Malaysia, 1,900 in Indonesia and 850 in Vietnam.  

 

 

INNOVATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE 

 

We continue to embrace technology in our pursuit to delight our customers as well as to improve 

our processes. Among the measures taken, with some having been elaborated on in the earlier 

sections, are as follows: 

 

 

Acceptance of eWallet payment at selected stores 

 

Launch of Parkson Card mobile app 

 

Implementation of B2B vendor online portal to facilitate vendors’ management process 

 

Implementation of LionPeople Global HR Information System to streamline our people 

management process
