Message from

The Board of Directors

As is the case with many other industries, the 

COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented 

impact upon the shipping industry; and was clearly 

the predominant factor throughout 2020 and thus 

far in 2021. The pandemic led to changing demand 

for seaborne transportation, resulting in high 

volatility in freight rates and severely disrupting 

vessel operations. Yet, the pandemic has shown 

the importance of the shipping industry to keep 

global supply chains running. At the same time, 

international travel restrictions have made crew 

changes exceedingly difficult, with hundreds of 

thousands of seafarers ‘stranded’ on ships around 

the world. Addressing the crew-change crisis has 

become one of the most pressing issues for the 

industry, and we have been working closely with 

the managers of our vessels to find solutions that 

mitigate the impact of travel restrictions imposed 

upon our crews.  In pursuit of this objective, we 

became a signatory to the Neptune Declaration for 

Seafarer Wellbeing and Crew Change, which defines 

specific actions to address the crisis; gives the 

industry one voice, and calls upon the responsibility 

of all stakeholders, including governments, to 

implement solutions to solve the crisis.

A further significant factor is the increasing 

importance 

of 

decarbonising 

the 

shipping 

industry in the drive to combat climate change. 

The environmental framework is tightening, with 

the International Maritime Organisation and 

governments around the world setting ambitious 

targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions: last 

year’s introduction of the IMO 2020 Sulphur cap, 

just marking the beginning and, in less than two 

years from now, ships will need to start measuring 

and reporting their carbon emissions every year, 

whilst it is also broadly expected that a tax on all 

carbon emissions above a set standard will be 

imposed for shipping. This is already happening in 

many other industries, and many major shipping 

industry stakeholders are making commitments 

towards zero-emissions, even as early as 2030. 

Decarbonisation has become the number one 

challenge for the shipping industry in the medium- 

and long-term and will be a vital driver in the 

fortunes of any shipping business in the future. A 

key to what the future holds is to determine what 

fuels, fuel and propulsion technologies will be 

developed that satisfy the environmental agenda. 

We have therefore become a member of the 

‘Getting to Zero Coalition’, which aims to foster the 

development of commercially viable ‘net-zero’ fuel 

technology by 2030, through the collaboration of 

industry participants along the whole value chain.

Sustainability is at our core and is respected in all 

aspects of our operations. Accordingly, in 2020, 

we disposed of our older, less environmentally 

friendly vessels that will consequently become 

competitively disadvantaged. Alongside economic 

and commercial factors, everything we undertake 

in the future will need to stand a sustainability-test, 

as we continue to prioritise the reduction of the 

environmental footprint of First Ship Lease Trust.

About This Annual 

Sustainability Report

About

First Ship Lease Trust

We have first started with the periodic reporting 

of sustainability aspects of First Ship Lease Trust in 

the annual report for the financial year 2013 and 

introduced a dedicated annual sustainability report 

in 2018. The last report was published on 31 May 

2020. This is our 4th annual sustainability report and 

addresses the significant environmental, social and 

governance (ESG) aspects of the business of FSL 

Trust for the financial year 2020 (1 January 2020 to 

31 December 2020), unless otherwise indicated. 

The scope of this report covers material ESG issues 

and considerations of First Ship Lease Trust and 

its trustee-manager, FSL Trust Management Pte. 

Ltd., which includes operational aspects, aspects 

First Ship Lease Trust (“FSL Trust” or the “Trust”) 

is a Singapore-based business trust, which owns 

a diversified fleet of well-maintained, oceangoing 

vessels across different segments. The current vessel 

portfolio comprises eleven tankers of different sizes. 

Of these, nine vessels are chartered to international 

shipping companies on fixed-rate period charters, 

whilst the other two vessels are employed in pools.

As at 31 December 2020, more than 36% of the 

Trust’s revenue is derived from the hires received from 

fixed-rate bareboat charters. The fixed-rate bareboat 

charters provide the Trust with stable and predictable 

long-term revenue and cash flow, while the vessels 

employed on shorter-term charters or in pools provide 

the Trust with flexibility and the opportunity to 

participate in any market upside.

FSL Trust is managed by FSL Trust Management Pte. 

Ltd. (“FSLTM” or the “Trustee-Manager”). The Trustee-

Manager is responsible for safeguarding the interest 

of the unitholders of the Trust and for the Trust’s 

investment and financing strategies, asset acquisitions 

and disposal policies, and the overall management 

of the Trust’s portfolio. The Trustee-Manager aims 

to optimise the returns of the Trust’s vessel portfolio 

by ensuring that the vessels are well run, managing 

the various risks and opportunities associated with 

the business of the Trust and improving cash flow 

generation for the Trust.

The units of FSL Trust are listed on the Mainboard of the 

Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (SGX-

ST) under the ticker “D8DU”. The largest unitholder is 

the sponsor of the Trust, FSL Holdings Pte. Ltd. (the 

“Sponsor”) with a unitholding of currently c.73%. The 

Sponsor’s sole shareholder is Prime Shareholdings 

Inc., which is an affiliate of the Greece-based Prime 

Marine Group, a leading international ship-owner and 

ship-manager of crude oil tankers, product tankers 

and gas tankers.

The Trustee-Manager maintains its principal office in 

Singapore. The vessels of FSL Trust are used in the 

seaborne transport of liquid bulk cargoes and trade 

world-wide.

of the governance followed, social aspects and 

environmental aspects. We consider the standards 

published by the internationally recognised Global 

Reporting Initiative (GRI) to be a suitable and robust 

framework for the reporting of ESG issues and this 

report has been prepared in accordance with the 

GRI Standards: Core option. Through identifying the 

material issues, the application of the GRI Standards 

ensures the ESG issues discussed in this report are 

relevant, consistent and comparable. This report 

also addresses the reporting requirements of the 

Singapore Exchange (SGX) on sustainability reporting 

and has been prepared by the Trustee-Manager 

without obtaining external assurance.

About Our Approach

To Sustainability

Of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, we have identified four goals that are of particular relevance to the shipping 

industry and where we, as a ship-owner, can have the highest contribution and impact: 

The shipping industry carries a multitude of risks related to spills, health and safety, emissions and others. 

We follow a holistic approach to sustainability, which is an ongoing effort, to frame our corporate citizenship. 

To better understand the impact of our activities on our ecosystem of stakeholders and to identify the 

material issues relating to economic, environmental and social aspects, we have considered the United 

Nations Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals and conducted 

a materiality assessment along the lines of the GRI’s core principles.

About Our Approach

To Sustainability

Our Stakeholders

We recognise that we work in an ecosystem with a 

variety of different stakeholders and as we are part 

of the supply chain of our customers whilst other 

stakeholders are part of our supply chain. Hence, our 

stakeholders have an influence on the sustainability 

of our operations and vice versa. We have considered 

all relevant stakeholders of FSL Trust in determining 

the sustainability strategy and we have established 

an approach for the ongoing engagement with our 

stakeholders to better understand the impact and 

sustainability of what we do. The engagement with 

our stakeholders varies depending on the subject 

and we engage with our stakeholders on a frequent 

or infrequent, periodic or ad hoc-basis. The feedback 

we receive from our stakeholders is a valuable tool 

for us to identify potential risks and opportunities 

as well as to understand the effectiveness of our 

work and approach to sustainability in our effort to 

constantly improve.

About Our Approach

To Sustainability

Our Materiality Assessment

We have considered several issues which we have 

prioritised and clustered according to importance, 

given 

its 

significance 

and 

influence 

on 

our 

stakeholders. As a result, we have identified the 

following issues as material aspects within the three 

pillars of environmental, social and governance (ESG) 

complemented by economic aspects:

ENVIRONMENT

• Selection of technical managers  

and charterers

• Compliance with maritime laws  

and regulation

• Vessel maintenance

• Pollution

• Technology and fleet strategy

SOCIAL

• Staff – fair pay and benefits

• Employee training and qualifications

• Health &amp; Safety – high quality operations 

to avoid accidents at sea

GOVERNANCE

• Board of Directors and  

Senior Management

• Policies and internal controls, including 

compliance with laws and regulations, 

and conflicts of interest

• Financial reporting and transparency

ECONOMIC

• Economic viability of our activities

• Ability to meet all financial  

and non-financial obligations 

• Value creation for our unitholders

Our Targets and Progress Made

We frequently set specific targets in relation to 

aspects of sustainability which we work towards. 

Whilst many of the targets are a continuous effort, 

there are a few specific aspects we wish to report:

• In the reporting period 1 January 2020 to  

31 December 2020, we have disposed six 

older, environmentally less friendly vessels, 

namely FSL Elixir, FSL Eminence, FSL Enhancer, 

FSL Perth, FSL Piraeus and FSL Shanghai.  

The disposals of the older, environmentally 

less friendly vessels helps us to reduce our 

GHG emission and improve our environmental 

footprint. Subsequent to the year end, we 

have furthermore sold the two conventionally 

fuelled LR2 product tanker newbuildings FSL 

Fos and FSL Suez in February 2021 and the 

vessel FSL Osaka in March 2021.

• 

Environmental aspects have been embedded 

in the core strategy of the Trust, in order to 

contribute to addressing climate change, 

which we consider is one of the most pressing 

challenges for humanity. In particular, any future 

projects need to help improving the carbon 

emission footprint of the Trust and comply with 

future low/net zero-emissions targets.

• 

We have identified several KPIs to measure and 

manage the sustainability of our activities, with a 

particular focus on the emission of greenhouse 

gases, health and safety, oil pollution and 

compliance with maritime laws and regulation. 

The KPIs help us to measure and manage our 

sustainability performance and prepare us for 

the potential future adoption of additional 

sustainability reporting standards.

We want to further improve the sustainability of 

our activities. Specifically, we want to continuously 

enhance our monitoring, management and 

reporting of sustainability issues.

Audit and Risk Committee (“ARC”)

The ARC is responsible for, amongst other things, a) reviewing significant financial reporting matters 

and judgements so as to ensure integrity of the financial statements and any announcements, and b) 

monitoring and evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal controls and appointment of 

the internal auditor. The ARC comprises three independent directors, namely Michael Gray (Chairman), 

Michael Oliver (member) and N. Sreenivasan (member).

Nominating Committee (“NC”)

The NC is responsible for, amongst other things, a) identifying and recommending to the BoD 

candidates for nomination for appointment as directors and/or key management personnel and the 

different committees, and b) reviewing the structure, size and composition of the BoD and making 

recommendations for any adjustments deemed necessary. The NC comprises three independent 

directors, namely Michael Oliver (Chairman), Michael Gray (member) and N. Sreenivasan (member).

The RC is responsible for, amongst other things, a) reviewing and recommending a framework of 

remuneration policies for the BoD and key management personnel, and b) recommending specific 

remuneration packages for each director as well as for key management personnel. The RC comprises 

three independent directors, namely Michael Oliver (Chairman), Michael Gray (member) and N. 

Sreenivasan (member).

OUR POLICIES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS

We have a number of policies and practices in place to cover significant aspect of our operations, 

including risk management. These policies and practices help us to comply with laws and regulations, 

reduce the risk of incidents and improve the way we work.

Risk Management

Our risk management policies are designed to help us to identify, understand, measure and manage 

risks related to our operations, the markets we operate in, the counterparties we work with and the 

assets we own.

Code of Conduct

Our code of conduct covers a variety of matters including, but not limited to, conflicts of interest, 

discrimination and harassment and anti-corruption and provides our people with a comprehensive 

framework of our principles and values and the culture and conduct we want to follow. One of the 

cornerstones of our code of conduct is that we do not tolerate any unethical or illegal behaviour of 

any of our members of staff, the Senior Management or directors. Combined with the whistle-blowing 

policy we have in place, the code of conduct is an efficient tool for us to prevent conflicts of interest, 

fraud or any other malpractices.

Whistle-Blowing

We have a whistle-blowing policy in place that provides a framework for our people as well as any other 

persons, such as customers, business partners and other external parties to raise concerns regarding 

possible improprieties in the conduct of our business activities, financial reporting or other malpractices 

directly to the ARC. No such matter or any other violation of our code of conduct was raised to the ARC 

in the reporting period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020.

The policies are frequently reviewed by the senior management and updated with recommendations 

made to the ARC for approval as appropriate.

BDO LLP, a reputable independent public accounting firm, has been appointed to carry out the internal 

audit function, reporting to the ARC. Within its mandate, BDO LLP conducts a comprehensive internal 

audit every year and submits its audit report to the ARC. The audit report includes observations and 

recommendations how to strengthen the internal control framework of the Trust and the Trustee-Manager.

Our Financial Reporting

FSL Trust publishes audited annual financial statements on a consolidated basis. The last audited 

annual financial statements were for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 and include a list of all 

subsidiaries of the Trust on page 86 (note 5 to the financial statements). The annual financial statements 

of FSL Trust are audited by Moore Stephens LLP, a reputable independent public accounting firm.

FSL Trust also publishes unaudited interim financial statements on a quarterly basis.

About  

Our Operations

As a ship-owner, we own a fleet of vessels that are 

chartered to international shipping companies or 

deployed in pools.

OUR FLEET

As at 31 December 2020, the vessel portfolio of 

FSL Trust comprised twelve operating tankers 

of different sizes and two LR2 product tanker 

newbuildings under construction. The operating 

vessels were deployed in the international 

seaborne transportation and carry cargoes such as 

crude oil, refined oil products, chemical products 

and other liquid bulk cargoes.

Of the twelve operating vessels, nine vessels were 

chartered to international shipping companies 

on fixed-rate period charters, including bareboat 

charters and time charters, whilst three vessels 

were employed in pools. The two LR2 product 

tanker newbuildings under construction were 

delivered to FSL Trust in February 2021.

The weighted average age, based on DWT, of 

our fleet including the two LR2 product tanker 

newbuildings was approximately seven years as at 

31 December 2020.

Subsequent to the reporting period, through 

the disposal of the two LR2 product tanker 

newbuildings FSL Fos and FSL Suez in February 

2021 and FSL Osaka in March 2021, the fleet has 

been reduced to eleven vessels with a weighted 

average age of approximately 15 years as at the 

date of publishing this report.

TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT OF OUR VESSELS

Depending on the type of employment, the technical management of the vessels is either carried out 

by the charterer or technical managers we have appointed.

Of the twelve operating vessels in our fleet as at 31 December 2020, seven vessels were technically 

managed by their charterers whilst five vessels were technically managed by technical managers 

appointed by us. The charter agreements for the vessels technically managed by their charterers 

require the charterers to comply with all applicable international laws and regulations, which includes 

environmental regulations. Similarly, the technical managers we have appointed for vessels follow all 

the international laws and regulations, have appropriate policies and procedures in place, including 

policies and procedures for health and safety as well as environmental protection, and hold all necessary 

certifications.

The technical managers have been selected based on rigid criteria and we constantly monitor their 

performance and compliance with all applicable maritime laws and regulations. Amongst other things, 

the technical managers are responsible to comply with all regulatory, class and flag state requirements 

for our vessels managed by them and the employment of the crews on board of our vessels.

We closely monitor the operational performance of our vessels, the maintenance and repairs carried 

out by the technical managers and the budget control of operating expenses and capital expenditures. 

Working with different technical managers furthermore allows us to benchmark the performance and 

cost efficiency. Where appropriate and in line with industry standards, we agree KPIs with the technical 

managers in relation to compliance with maritime laws and regulations as well as operational aspects 

of the management. 

In 2020, our technical managers were:

• Columbia Shipmanagement (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.  

 

(www.columbia-shipmanagement.com)

• Prime Tanker Management Inc.  

 

(www.prime-marine.net)

• Thome Ship Management Pte. Ltd.  

 

(www.thome.com.sg)

• Wallem Shipmanagement Limited  

 

(www.wallem.com)

Our technical managers receive a remuneration for their services in accordance with market standards.

About  

Our Operations

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN

In addition to working with our charterers and technical managers, we work with commercial managers 

which are responsible for managing the pools some of our vessels are part of. These commercial 

managers are responsible for the chartering of these vessels and receive a remuneration for their 

services in accordance with market standards. 

We furthermore have a variety of other suppliers and service providers for different aspects of our 

activities whereby the relevant internal policies apply.

We are dedicated to promoting sustainable practices within our supply chain with regards to quality, 

environmental and social standards and ethical behaviour.
