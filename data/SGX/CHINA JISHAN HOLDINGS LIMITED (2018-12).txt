Chairman’s Message

Dear Shareholders：

This is our second Sustainability Report for which we have adopted the Global Reporting

Initiative’s (“GRI”) reporting guidelines. The report covers areas that are believed to be significant

for China Jishan, including our corporate governance, sustainability strategies, policies towards

employees, environmental impact, safety management, quality responsibility, as well as our

actions to support society.

The Group has leased office space and plant and equipment to third parties. This is part of our

rationalization strategy to ensure a stream of stable and recurring income from the lease of part of

our unutilized factory space, and plant and equipment. This has enabled us to streamline our

operations to more efficiently utilize our capacity, as well as diversify our income streams.

However, the Group strengthened monitoring operations of the lessees to ensure that the Group’s

sustainability policies are achieved.

During the year of 2018, the Group continued to integrate its sustainable development with its own

operations and identified the risks and opportunities of the Group in environmental, social and

governance for each business operation. The strategy combines these elements with previous

achievements, continuously enhances the awareness of the Group on these elements and

ensures long-term improvements.

Sustainability Policy

To practice good corporate citizenship, China Jishan has 

the responsibility to protect the environment in the long-run. 

The group integrates the concept of low-carbon and 

sustainable development into the operation and 

management process.  We ensure that our business 

operations, as well as those of our lessees, are carried out 

in a responsible manner and we do our best to minimize 

any negative impact relating to carbon emissions, waste 

and the consumption of energy and resources. 



Climate Change – The Impact on Print and Dye Industry

Textiles are a fundamental part of everyday life and an important sector in the global economy. In

terms of value, the global market size of the textile staples market is expected to expand from

nearly US$125 billion in 2017 to over US$200 billion by 2027, registered a compound annual

growth rate of 4.9% during the forecast period 2017-2027. As printing and dyeing is a crucial

processing stage in the textiles industry, it will also be in an upward trend in the long run.

The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”) estimates that global emissions will

increase from the current 2% to 3% by 2050. IPCC also estimates that global temperatures will rise

by 4 degrees Celsius by the year 2100, if no action is taken to reduce emission of anthropogenic

greenhouse gas emissions. Although only responsible for a comparatively small percentage of

global emissions, the print and dye industry is making efforts to reduce its carbon footprint.




SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 | CHINA JISHAN HOLDINGS LIMITED





12

Energy Utilization

The principal sources of energy used by the lessees’ business

operations are electricity, water and steam. Electricity is used to

power the processing machines in the workshops, which is

essential for business operations. Water consumption is used to

print and dye the fabrics. After processing, water effluent is

discharged to wastewater treatment plants for further treatment.

The steam is used for processing fabrics. Two types of steams

are used in the factory: low-pressure steam for fabric treatment;

and middle-pressure steam for heat setting. Currently, energy is

mainly utilized by lessees in the factories and the Group is

responsible for supervising and regulating their operations and

production, including energy utilization.

Water Consumption and Sewage Disposal

Due to the increased production by lessees in 2018, water consumption increased by 18.59 %

comparing with 2017. However in 2018, the lessees built a wastewater pool in the factory which

was much more efficient in wastewater processing compared to 2017, water consumption in unit

sewage disposal decreased.

The constitution of the sewage and its treatment are illustrated in the next two pages. In 2017,

sewage disposal was approximately 24% higher than the volume of water consumption, as

chemical additives in the print and dye processing are mainly fluids. The dyeing effluent would be

discharged with the water consumed during the processing efficiency. In 2018, sewage disposal

was approximately 12.22% higher than the volume of water consumption. The sharp decrease of

water consumption in unit sewage disposal

in 2018 was led by improvements in processing

efficiency that required less water to produce the same amount of fabric.

Improvement of Textile Auxiliaries to Protect Environment

Developments in technology have helped the textile industry in its efforts to

protect the environment. Print and dye

processing

industry

now

uses

environmentally-friendly textile auxiliaries instead of chemical auxiliaries, which

are environmentally friendly and in compliance with European standards. Our

lessees too have participated in this transition, thus contributing to less pollution

from the effluent discharged from our factory which can be treated more easily.




SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 | CHINA JISHAN HOLDINGS LIMITED

Wastewater Management

Apart from using environmentally friendly textile

auxiliaries, in 2018, the lessees built a waste

pool

for

pre-treatment

before

discharging

wastewater to the wastewater treatment plant.

The pre-treatment capacity of the waste pool is

2,500 tons/day. The construction of the waste

pool reduced the sewage discharge from the

factory to a certain extent.

The factory was relocated to Binhai District, 

Shaoxing City at the end of 2016 and this 

district is equipped with one of the largest 

wastewater treatment facilities, with an 

average flow rate of 900,000 cubic meters per 

day (m3/day). Wastewater discharged from 

different mills in Binhai District will be treated 

uniformly so that the water quality meets the 

national standard and is safe to be discharged 

into the nearby river. The construction of the 

third phase of the sewage treatment plant by 

government was completed in 2018. It greatly 

improved the sewage treatment capacity of the   

Group.

19

Steam Consumption

Steam utilization increased by 24.38% in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was mainly due to

an increase in textile production in 2018.

Currently, lessees use two types of steam in the factory: low-pressure steam for fabric treatment;

and middle-pressure steam for heat setting.

Lessees are attempting to adapt new technology in future for fabrics processing to improve

production efficiency and reduce steam consumption.

invited to demonstrate how to  operate fire equipment and how to perform fire rescue. The 

training taught our staff how to respond quickly to the situation and how to protect themselves 

from fire accidents.





Fire First Aid Training Course-Practical

Experts from the fire department also demonstrated the way of using the fire extinguisher and 

how to put out a fire using a hydraulic giant. This is essential for the processing workshop 

employees because the fabrics are made of flammable materials.

Quality Products

23

Quality Responsibility

It is mandatory for the lessees, in the provision of product

quality, to comply strictly with quality standards, thus being

responsible to the customers and community.

Anti-Corruption Practices

We have updated the content on anti-corruption/anti-bribery practices in our latest policy and

included the relevant clauses in the new contracts that require all suppliers to comply with all local

laws where they operate. Moreover, suppliers should disclose to us immediately if they learn of any

such violations.

In addition, we have improved the relevant rules in our code of conduct on clean governance, with

the aim of creating an enterprise free of corruption through the supervision of our corporate

management system.

To further enhance business transparency by our staff and to facilitate a channel for any

misconduct or violations to be reported, a whistleblowing policy has also been established to reveal

conduct that is procedurally noncompliant or which may lead to potential frauds.



The lessees have strict criteria for selecting suppliers and the textile auxiliaries they use are

environmental friendly and in compliance with related standards. Therefore, the effluent discharged

from our factory is less polluted and can be treated more easily.

The lessees’ procurement functions execute pre- and post-control measures through supplier

selection and supplier management to ensure the commitment to fulfilling corporate social

responsibilities.

Supporting the Community

24

Our success would not have been possible without the

support from our community. As such, we believe in

reinvesting into the community. We actively promote a

good relationship with the communities in which our

operations are located, including engaging in charitable

and

voluntary

work

to

support

the

long-term

development of the community.





China Jishan invests in the education of young people. We have established long-term technical

cooperation with the National Dyeing and Finishing Engineering Research and Development

Center, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University and other research centers. We are eager to provide work

opportunities for young people who have passion for the print and dye industry.

We also encourage the staff to make contributions to our community. We have organized

voluntary blood donation activities to strength our relationships with governmental organizations,

charitable organizations and social organizations. Jishan Group injects money to local poverty

alleviation funds each year, benefiting those poor villagers.

Warm winter

District, Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, the Group distributed cash to each poor household 

and sent warmth to poor villagers in Wuyang Village, Fuquan Street.
