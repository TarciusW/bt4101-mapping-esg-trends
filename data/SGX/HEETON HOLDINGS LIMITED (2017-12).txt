About Heeton 

Heeton Holdings Limited is a real estate 

conglomerate focused on property 

development, 

investment 

and 

management. Established in 1976, the 

company was listed on the Singapore 

Stock Exchange in September 2003, 

and has extended its business beyond 

Singapore 

to 

Thailand, 

Australia, 

Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam and the 

United Kingdom. We formed strong 

partnership with other established real 

estate groups to develop properties 

locally and globally. Heeton’s real 

estate portfolio includes commercial 

properties 

(shopping 

malls 

and 

serviced offices) and hotels. We 

entered the hospitality sector in 2011 

and our portfolio has now increased to 

eight properties worldwide as on 

December 

2017. 

Developing 

the 

hospitality business is our key priority 

and moving forward we aspire to 

become a prominent player on the 

international hospitality stage.  

Board Statement 

At Heeton Holdings, we focus on 

delivering 

value 

by 

converting 

opportunities into sustainable growth 

avenues. This is backed by our core 

strength, strategies and sustainable 

decision-making, which have enabled 

us to maintain a steady course in our 

activities.  

In 

the 

real 

estate 

business, 

Environmental, Social and Governance 

(ESG) factors are playing an increasing 

important role towards making informed 

decisions. We believe in providing 

reliable and sustainable properties and 

services to our customers. Through the 

materiality 

assessment, 

we 

have 

identified ESG factors which are most 

relevant to our business. We have set 

out on how we are managing the 

impacts and performance in these 

areas and our targets for upcoming 

year. 

Supported 

by 

our 

dedicated 

Sustainability Committee (“SC”), the 

Board oversees direction, management 

and monitoring of sustainability related 

performance 

which 

includes 

the 

Sustainability 

Report. 

This 

report 

adheres to the reporting requirements 

of Singapore Exchange (SGX) Listing 

Rules Practice Note 7.6 Sustainability 

Reporting Guide and references the 

internationally 

recognized 

Global 

Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards 

2016.  

Finally, our vision is to create wider 

societal and environmental benefits 

beyond our financial performance. 

While working towards our vision, we 

aim to maximize shareholder returns 

and create value for our stakeholders. 

We want to acknowledge that our 

success reflects the immense support 

of our stakeholders and we invite you to 

join us in our sustainable journey. 

Executive Summary 

The landscape of real estate sector is 

rapidly changing, with an increasing 

emphasis on lifestyle options and 

quality of properties. Environmental 

and social consciousness amongst 

customers, with regards to impacts 

from the consumption of products and 

services, are rising as well. Against this 

backdrop 

of 

shifting 

customer 

expectations, more than ever, Heeton 

recognises the importance of managing 

the ESG aspects of our business.  

We 

have 

identified 

high 

impact 

sustainability issues which support our 

business strategy and represent key 


4 

 

risks and opportunities. 9 ESG factors 

were identified as material1, covering 

topics on governance, human resource 

practices, health and safety as well as 

environmental responsibilities.  

Heeton 

exercises 

strong 

internal 

sustainability governance to prevent 

corruption 

and 

ensure 

regulatory 

compliance. By subjecting suppliers 

and joint venture (“JV”) partners to 

baseline screening criteria, Heeton 

selectively 

works 

with 

business 

partners who share the same high 

standard 

of 

business 

ethics 

and 

promotes sustainability across the 

value chain.  

To retain and develop the right talent 

essential for growth, we encourage 

diversity and active learning among our 

employees. We tailor our training 

programmes to align with the learning 

requirements of the real estate industry, 

so we can stay competitive and 

versatile in capitalising on new market 

opportunities when they arise.  

Moreover, we place strong emphasis 

on health and safety issues. Through 

health and safety education and 

prevention of potential hazards, we 

create quality space and positive 

experience for our employees and all 

other building users.  

Heeton is committed to improving 

energy and water usage efficiency in its 

properties to reduce its environmental 

footprint.

Our Governance  

We strongly believe that our ability to 

maintain the highest ethical standards 

of 

compliance, 

transparency 

and 

business conduct directly translates 

into 

a 

long-lasting 

trust 

in 

our 

stakeholders. We have implemented a 

robust governance structure to ensure 

that we grow responsibly. The Board 

oversees 

the 

management 

of 

sustainability issues. The SC develops 

sustainability strategy, manages overall 

sustainability 

performance 

and 

integrates sustainability practices into 

our business. The SC also reports 

periodically 

to 

the 

Board 

on 

sustainability-related issues.  

 

Managing ESG issues in our value 

chain 

Heeton is working towards promoting 

sustainability across our value chain. 

The nature of our real estate business 

often requires appointment of a third 

party service provider, or to work 

together with a Joint Venture (JV) 

partner. We recognise the importance 

of 

maintaining 

transparency 

and 

working responsibly in our value chain. 

Due diligence of our suppliers and JV 

partners enables us to assess and 

mitigate any impacts along our value 

chain to keep the trust of our 

stakeholders intact. 

We prioritise suppliers and contractors 

who engage in sustainable practices to 

ensure 

safe 

working 

conditions, 

respecting worker rights. All Heeton’s 

suppliers are encouraged to adhere to 

our minimum ESG compliance levels 

and are required to obtain Building and 

Construction 

Authority 

(BCA) 

certifications. In our supplier selection 

process, 

we 

conduct 

background 

checks to verify the compliance with 

labour practices with a good safety 

track record.  

In some of the property developments, 

Heeton 

works 

together 

with 

JV 

partners. Robust governance over the 

selection of JV partners help us to avoid 

any negative publicity. We keep a close 

watch on our JV partners in the news 

coverage and ensure that any ESG 

issues are addressed promptly. We 

have screened all of our suppliers and 

JV partners based on our existing 

criteria on supplier selection.  

Moving forward, we will consistently 

practise existing due diligence process 

for our suppliers and JV partners.  

Preventing corruption  

Heeton is committed to upholding a 

high level of business ethics and 

integrity. We do not allow any form of 

corruption, 

which 

encompasses 

dishonest business practices such as 

conflict of interest, acceptance of gifts 

or improper use of insider information. 

We believe that the prevention of 

corruption is vital to safeguard the 

interests of our stakeholders and our 

reputation. The employee code of 

conduct is included in the Group’s 

handbook, together with terms and 

conditions that directs an employee on 

issues like conduct and discipline, 

outside employment, confidentiality, 

intellectual 

property 

and 

others. 

Employees are required to adhere to 

these corporate policies: 

• 

Anti-Corruption policy 

• 

Anti-Money Laundering policy 

• 

Whistle-blowing policy 

• 

Policy on black-out periods 

All new hires are required to go through 

a mandatory induction programme 

where they are sensitized to our code of 

conduct, policies and procedures. Our 


7 

 

whistleblowing 

policy 

aims 

to 

encourage responsible and secure 

reporting of any incident of violation or 

suspected violation of code of conduct 

such as unethical or illegal practices in 

good faith. In case of any such incident, 

one 

is 

encouraged 

to 

report 

to 

Departmental Manager, HR Manager 

and the Management. In case of any 

dissatisfaction, one can even reach out 

to Executive Deputy Chairman (EDC) 

or Audit Committee Chairman (ACC). 

We have regular checks on our 

suppliers and business partners for 

anti-money laundering and highlight 

any other unethical practices. We are 

pleased to report that there were no 

incidents of corruption and aim to 

maintain zero corruption incidents for 

FY2018. 

Ensuring environmental compliance  

The building and construction industry 

is heavily regulated. Environmental 

laws and regulations are present to 

manage externalities such as air 

pollution, noise and waste water 

discharge. Compliance with relevant 

environmental laws is the baseline to 

meet stakeholders’ expectations and 

maintain the license to operate. In 

Heeton, we conduct our business in an 

environmentally responsible way.  

Our properties are subjected to multiple 

environmental laws and regulations, 

such as the Environmental Protection 

and Management Act and the Energy 

Conservation Act. We actively identify 

and 

manage 

our 

environmental 

regulatory risks. In addition, we are kept 

abreast 

of 

developments 

in 

environmental 

law 

and 

related 

legislative updates.  

In our property development, we target 

for minimum compliance on applicable 

environmental legislation.  

In FY2017, there was no incidence of 

non-compliance 

with 

environmental 

laws and regulations which resulted in 

significant fines or sanctions. We aspire 

to maintain similar standards and 

ensure 

zero 

environmental 

non-

compliance for next year.  

Our People 

We take pride in our workforce. Given 

the 

rapidly 

changing 

business 

landscape, it is important for Heeton to 

recruit and retain employees with the 

relevant skill set and expertise. 

As at 31 December 2017, we had in 

total 40 employees. In FY2017, our 

average monthly new hires rate was 

1.9%. The chart below shows the 

gender breakdown of new hires rate 

and turnover rate. For FY2018, we 

target 

to 

maintain 

our 

employee 

turnover rate.  

 

 

Diversifying our workforce 

Diversity in our workforce promotes 

creativity and different viewpoints. 

Heeton’s human resource policies are 

grounded in equal opportunities and fair 

employment 

practices. 

In 

our 

recruitment 

process, 

all 

qualified 

candidates will be considered without 

discrimination of gender, age, ethnicity, 

religion 

and 

national 

origin. 

Our

Valuing our employees 

In recognition of contribution to the 

success of Heeton’s business, we 

reward our staff with competitive 

salaries in line with market standards to 

retain 

our 

skilled 

workforce.  

Compensation to individual employee 

is determined based on position, 

competency 

and 

performance. 

Furthermore, employees are entitled to 

a variety of benefits, such as medical 

care, paid annual leave and birthday 

leave. They can also opt for a flexible 

work arrangement.  The Employee’s 

Handbook and Terms and Conditions 

of Employment provides employees 

with general guidelines about our 

policies, procedures and practices, 

terms and conditions, as well as the 

competitive compensation and benefits 

package available to them. 

 

Enhancing skills of our employees 

In a dynamic business environment, 

Heeton 

recognises 

the 

need 

to 

continually update our employees with 

the skills necessary for growth.  In 

response, Heeton adopts an active 

approach to learning. We support 

personal and professional development 

of our employees through training 

programs to empower them to reach 

their full potential.  

We provide a range of learning and 

development programmes to ensure 

that our employees keep up with new 

technologies and opportunities in real 

estate sector, as illustrated in the table 

below.

We also encourage our employees to 

take up external courses for their 

professional 

development. 

Our 

employees can apply for financial 

sponsorship for eligible courses and be 

granted up to 7 days of study leave per 

year.  

 

Our Human Resources Department 

also tracks and monitors the training 

records of employee training. One-on-

one training reviews are conducted with 

employees to analyse gaps with the 

objectives of the training programme. 

This helps us to identify new focus 

areas of training programs. In FY2017, 

we have achieved an average of 10 

hours of training per employee. The 

chart below shows the breakdown of 

average training hours per gender and 

per employee category.  

 

 

 

We 

conduct 

annual 

performance 

reviews to communicate employees’ 

performance and career goals to 

support the professional growth of our 

employees. 

In 

2017, 

100% 

of 

permanent employees have received 

feedback on their performance and 

suggestions on improvement from their 

supervisors.  

 

We will continue to fine-tune our 

training programmes to be better 

aligned with the learning needs of our 

employees 

by 

conducting 

a 

gap 

analysis for their skillset.  In FY2018, 

we target to maintain the current 

training hours per employee

Our Safety Practices 

Heeton recognises the responsibility to 

provide a safe and healthy working 

environment 

for 

our 

employees, 

customers and all other building users. 

As an employer, we continuously 

monitor and manage the health and 

safety 

in 

the 

workplace 

through 

mitigation of safety hazards. As a 

landlord, we have a responsibility to 

ensure that our tenants and users of our 

properties are safe from injury when 

they are in our properties.  

We assess the environmental safety 

practices to identify potential hazards 

on a regular basis. The risk assessment 

is reviewed and updated regularly to 

follow preventive and corrective action 

plan for potential incidences. We 

provide 

an 

open 

channel 

of 

communication across all levels to 

gather feedback on issues relating to 

health and safety. In addition, we aim to 

inculcate a culture of ownership for 

health and safety among employees 

and tenants through regular safety 

education and training. 

Heeton has established standard safety 

procedures and contingency plans. As 

part of these procedures, our property 

managers have established Fire Safety 

Practices and conduct regular fire 

safety audits and drills.  Equipment is 

inspected and upgraded whenever 

necessary to ensure that they are in 

sound working condition. The property 

managers also ensure timely renewal of 

operating permits and licenses for fire 

safety installations, lifts and escalators 

and areas of high safety risks.  

Moreover, the importance of safety is 

emphasised during engagements with 

third party service providers. In our 

development 

projects, 

health 

and 

safety weekly meetings are conducted 

by the main contractor along with 

Heeton’s project manager to discuss on 

issues concerning health and safety 

issues. We also conduct regular site 

visits to ensure that our main contractor 

is complying with all health and safety 

requirements. Corrective actions are 

enforced for any safety concerns in the 

site.  

In FY2017, there were no workplace 

fatalities 

reported 

for 

Heeton's 

employees.  

Going 

forward, 

Heeton 

will 

stay 

committed to promoting occupational 

and customer health and safety. In 

FY2018, we aim to maintain zero work-

related fatalities and maintain zero 

fatalities for all other building users and 

zero 

cases 

of 

non-compliance 

concerning customer health and safety.  

Our Environment  

The real estate sector in Singapore and 

the world is progressively moving 

towards sustainable buildings, which 

emphasise 

the 

efficient 

use 

of 

resources, including energy, water and 

materials. 

Heeton 

seeks 

to 

stay 

relevant in the changing business 

landscape 

and 

is 

committed 

to 

improving environmental performance 

in our investment properties.  

According to the Building Energy 

Efficiency R&amp;D Roadmap initiated by 

National Climate Change Secretariat 

(NCCS) 

and 

National 

Research 

Foundation 

(NRF), 

buildings 

are 

responsible 

for 

around 

half 

of 

Singapore’s electricity consumption. 

Heeton recognizes the importance of 

sustainability, the need for energy 

savings, 

energy 

efficiency, 

and 

adoption of 

rooftop 

solar 

energy 

initiatives in the buildings. 


11 

 

We promote environmental awareness 

among our employees and tenants by 

sending out e-mails on best practices to 

improve the environment around us. 

Heeton adopts green practices to 

improve 

resource 

efficiency. 

To 

conserve energy used in lighting, we 

have installed LEDs and motion-sensor 

light switches in our properties. We 

understand our responsibility on our 

resource 

savings, 

and 

therefore, 

engineering 

team 

updates 

the 

management about energy and water 

consumption through monthly property 

reports. This regular tracking of our 

resource consumption helps to detect 

any irregularities in water and electricity 

usage in our investment properties. 

In FY2017, our investment properties 

consumed 

8,468 

megawatt 

hours 

(“MWh”) of electricity. Our overall 

building energy intensity was 252 

kilowatt hours per square meter of floor 

area 

(kWh/m2). 

Indirect 

GHG 

emissions2 and intensity attributable to 

electricity 

consumption 

in 

our 

investment properties in FY2017 were 

approximately 3,594 tCO2e and 0.11 

tCO2e/m2, 

respectively. 

The 

total 

building water consumption recorded 

was 87,543 m3 and the water intensity 

was 2.60 m3 per m2 floor area in 

FY2017. We aim to maintain current 

energy and water intensity in FY2018. 

 

 

 

2 GHG emissions is derived based on the latest available Singapore’s Grid   

Emission Factors published by the Energy Market Authority.

How We Wrote This Report 

This is our first annual Sustainability 

Report. This report adheres to the 

reporting requirements of Singapore 

Exchange (SGX) Listing Rules Practice 

Note 7.6 Sustainability Reporting Guide 

and references the GRI Standards 

2016. It covers the period from 1st 

January 2017 to 31st December 2017.  

This report is our endeavor to articulate 

our 

sustainability 

approach 

and 

transparently 

communicate 

our 

performance. 

Our 

report 

covers 

sustainability topics relevant to our 

business in line with GRI Principles of 

Materiality 

and 

Stakeholder 

Inclusiveness. Should you have any 

comments or feedback, please send 

them to contact@heeton.com.  

Reporting scope and boundaries         

In defining the report scope, we have 

considered the level of operational 

control we have over the various 

properties as well as the significance of 

any resulting economic, environmental 

and social impacts.  

In our inaugural Sustainability Report, 

we have decided to cover Heeton’s 

headquarters, Property Development 

and Property Investment operations in 

Singapore only. As all our development 

work is outsourced to the contractors, 

we have covered environmental data 

for our Investment properties only.  

Our Property Development projects 

include:  

 

121 Collection on Whitley  

 

Westwood Residence  

 

Trio  

 

Onze @ Tanjong Pagar  

 

High Park Residence  

 

3 Economic Performance was identified as the 10th material factor. Please refer 

to our Annual Report 2017 for details on Economic Performance 

(http://www.heeton.com/wp-content/uploads/HeetonAnnualReport2017.pdf).  

 

Our Investment Properties include:  

 

Sun Plaza 

 

Tampines Mart  

 

The Woodgrove 

 

62 Sembawang Road 

All data is reported in good faith and 

to the best of our knowledge. 

Identifying material ESG factors  

In line with the GRI Standards, we 

undertook a materiality assessment 

exercise, facilitated by an independent 

consultant. We conducted a secondary 

research from the sources below and 

interviewed internal stakeholders to 

arrive at shortlisted material factors 

relevant to the business.  

• Global 

and 

local 

emerging 

sustainability trends;  

• Main topics and future challenges 

for the real estate sector, as 

identified by peers; 

• Sustainability reporting frameworks 

and 

relevant 

sector-specific 

guidance; and 

• Insights gained from day-to-day 

interactions 

with 

external 

stakeholders 

The pool of selected ESG factors were 

put to vote by the SC, based on their 

assessment of the extent of impact of 

these issues on Heeton’s business and 

level 

of 

concern 

of 

external 

stakeholders. The aggregated inputs 

from SC were combined to arrive at 9 

material ESG factors3 for Heeton, as 

illustrated in the table below.
