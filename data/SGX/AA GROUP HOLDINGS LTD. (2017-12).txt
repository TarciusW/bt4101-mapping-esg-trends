BOARD'S STATEMENT  

 

 

 

The Board of Directors (the “Board” or “Directors”) of AA Group Holdings Ltd (the 

“Company or “Group”) is pleased to publish our inaugural Sustainability Report 2017 

("Report").  

 

Sustainability is becoming a key component for companies to promote transparency on 

listed companies’ environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices. The Board 

believes that sustainability is integral to the Group’s strategy and operation and are making 

an effort to improve our business operations in a manner that considers the environmental 

and social impact while achieving sustainable profit growth.  

 

During the reporting year of 2017, the Company had acquired businesses whose main 

business activities are those of leasing of property and provision of property related 

services, manufacturing and supply of construction-related materials. The Company had, 

in the same year divested its previous core business - manufacturing and supply of high 

precision cold forged loudspeaker parts.  

 

In the pursuit of growth, we remain committed to the conserving of the environment and 

the development of our people. This Report plays an imperative role in helping us create 

transparency, accountability and progress towards sustainable growth.  

 

As we venture into new markets and sectors, we remain vigilant in the conduct of our 

businesses and continue to actively engage our stakeholders to meet their concerns and 

needs. The success of our sustainability journey requires continual efforts and we are 

confident that together with our stakeholders, we are able to formulate strategies to build 

a sustainable business. 

 

We would like to take this opportunity to extend our gratitude to the directors, stakeholders 

and business partners for their unwavering support and dedication this past year. We look 

forward to scale greater heights and to the journey that lies ahead of us. 

 

For and on behalf of  

the Board of Directors of  

AA Group Holdings Ltd

ABOUT THE REPORT 

 



This Report is prepared in line with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core 

reporting framework. Due to the GRI Standards’ universal application, it was selected as a 

guideline for the Report to allow comparability of our performance over the years.  

 

Unless specified otherwise, this Report covers our ESG performance and initiatives for our 

Group's operations in Singapore for the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. 

We have excluded our business operations in Malaysia as it does not have a significant 

representation on the Group's value chains in the reporting year of 2017. Please refer to 

page 89 of our Annual Report 2017 for details of our Discontinued Operations. 

 

As this is our first year of reporting, we have not sought external assurance for the 

information disclosed in this Report. We may consider to have our report verified by an 

independent third party in the near future. 

 

As part of our environmental conservation efforts, this Report is only available online on 

SGX. We want to share our sustainability journey and we welcome stakeholders to submit 

their feedback to us at our office address as stated on the last page of this report.

Material Topics 

We have conducted a materiality assessment that allowed us to identify the material topics 

that are significant to our businesses and to both internal and external stakeholders. The 

materiality assessment was guided by an external sustainability consultant and includes 

inputs from our management, key representatives from various business units as well as 

internal and external stakeholders.  

 

Reporting Framework 

An extensive list of material topics was evaluated and then ranked according to their 

importance from both internal and external stakeholder’s perspectives.  

The materiality assessment took into account the GRI guidelines and the material topics 

were consolidated and prioritised using a materiality matrix shown below.

GOVERNANCE 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We believe that upholding a high standard in governance and ethical conduct is 

fundamental to the Group's growth and vital to the sustainability of the Group. We conduct 

our business in an ethical and honest manner and approach issues of corruption and 

bribery in a manner that is consistent with the values of the Group.  

 

Corporate Governance 

The Board recognises the significance of good corporate governance, accountability and 

transparency and complies with the Singapore's Code of Corporate Governance as 

required under the Singapore Exchange Listing Rules. We have a robust Board of 

Directors, Audit and Risk Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration 

Committee which segregates various duties and functions to ensure the Group remains 

compliant to regulations.  

 

Please refer to page 13 to 48 of our Annual Report 2017 for more details of our Corporate 

Governance practices.  

In addition, a Sustainability Committee consisting of representatives from various business 

units have been established. Under the guidance of the Board, the Sustainability 

Committee will assist to increase transparency and accountability towards our Group's 

sustainable business practices in the coming years.

Risk Management  

The Audit and Risk Committee (“ARC”) is responsible for the governance of risks and the 

overall internal control framework by ensuring that the Group maintains a robust system of 

risk management and internal controls. The ARC works closely with the senior 

management and reports to the Board. 

On a regular basis, key representatives from various business units report to the senior 

management and the senior management reviews the Group's business and operational 

activities to identify and mitigate significant business risks. The senior management reports 

to the ARC on any significant matters arising from the business.   

On a bi-annual basis, the ARC convenes a meeting with the Group's internal and external 

auditors, to discuss the key areas affecting the business and re-evaluate the relevancy of 

the current internal control policies and procedures. If there are any weak areas of internal 

controls, appropriate measure would be conveyed to the senior management and senior 

management is to take appropriate measures to rectify the situation and put in place an 

updated policies and procedures. The ARC will follow up on the actions taken by the senior 

management and any recommendations given by both the internal and external auditors. 

By identifying and mitigating these risks, the Group will be able to take a balanced 

approach to manage risks and make more informed decisions to better protect and 

safeguard the interests of our stakeholders. 

For the year under review, the Board believes that the Group's framework for managing 

risks remains appropriate.  

Legal Compliance 

The Board meets on a regular basis to ensure that the Group meets all regulatory 

requirements. Due to our senior management's active monitoring, we have not had any 

records of non-compliance cases. 

 

As we have been actively engaging our continuing sponsor and complying to all reporting 

requirements under the Singapore Exchange as well as the rules and regulations in 

Singapore, there were no non-compliance cases recorded during the reporting year of 

2017. 

 

For the year under review, the Board believes that the Group's compliance controls remain 

appropriate and we strive to maintain zero incident of non-compliance record in the 

subsequent years.

Employment Practices 

Our workforce consists of full-time employees under our payroll, and we ensure that each 

employee is treated fairly to promote welfare and talent retention. We are fully compliant 

with the Singapore Government’s Employment Practices listed under the Ministry of 

Manpower to ensure we remain competitive against similar industry players.  

 

The Human Resource Policies and Procedures (“HRPP”) formulated by the Human 

Resource team have been applied universally across all the business units to ensure 

consistency of internal practices among all business units. The HRPP documents the 

employee's benefits and governs our non-discriminatory hiring policies and merit-based 

promotion policies .  

 

Similarly, employees or contractors have the discretion to air their grievances on unfair 

labour practices. The procedure of grievance communication within the Group involves 

reporting to the Supervisor, Department Head, Senior Management and subsequently to 

the Ministry of Manpower.  

 

The Group has a whistle-blowing policy in place since 2008 and has been constantly 

updated to stay relevant. The policies and procedures for raising any concerns is 

communicated to all employees of the Group during orientation for the new employee. 

Please refer to page 42 of the Annual Report 2017 for more details. 

 

 Workforce diversity and fair employment  

The Group recognises the value of diversity and all qualified candidates will be considered 

without discrimination of gender, nationality, age and religion in our recruitment process. 

Before hiring each qualified candidate, we conduct verification on the candidate's 

background. Whilst we expect our employees to constantly challenge and improve 

themselves, we also require our employees to treat each other with respect and honesty. 

 

We have a total number of 51 employees in Singapore and 5 directors on the Board. The 

chart below shows the breakdown of employees at each level as well as the directors on 

the Board.

 Valuing our employees 

The Group regards its employment practices as one of its top priority because it creates 

job satisfaction, which in turn lowers turnover rates and increases productivity. Employees 

are entitled to a variety of benefits, such as medical leave and paid annual leave. In 

addition, the Group offers competitive pay packages that are benchmarked to the market 

and rewards each employee based on their competency and performance.  

 

As part of our commitment towards providing transparent and merit-based compensation 

package, we disclose the remunerations of our directors and our key management 

personnel on page 34 of our Annual Report 2017.  

 

At the same time, we promote an open communication environment where employees can 

directly raise concerns with their supervisors through different platforms and channels, 

thereby creating an environment where our employees feel valued and respected. 

 

We acknowledge that there are more male employees as compared to female employees 

due to the nature of the industry and the businesses we are in. However, we currently have 

a female director on our Board and this shows the steps taken towards creating a greater 

gender balance within the Group. Moving ahead, we endeavour to create more 

opportunities to attract more female applicants to the company and the Group.

Occupational Health and Safety 

The health and safety of our employees is the most highly ranked concerns of the senior 

management. The senior management recognises the responsibility to provide a safe and 

healthy working environment for our employees and ensures that all business units remain 

compliant to workplace health and safety requirements. At the same time, all employees 

are reminded regularly to follow safety requirements.  

 

When there is an accident, there is a procedure of reporting and follow-up. All cases are 

reported to the supervisors and plant manager. Investigations will be carried out to ensure 

corrective actions have been implemented. 

 

We have procedures in place for all operations on site and we aim to maintain "Zero 

Accident" record at all sites with these initiatives: 

 

1. Appoint Safety Officer to educate and identify safety gaps and work towards closing 

all safety gaps. 

2. Develop standard operation procedure (SOP) manual and display the SOP 

explicitly at all sites with safety rules embedded in all the work processes to ensure 

that safety rules are strictly and consistently observed. 

3. Organize regular in-house safety training and have safety instruction diagrams 

available visibly near or on starting equipment. 

4. Provide external safety training to supervisors to upgrade their skills and to keep 

abreast of latest safety rules and procedures. 

 

Our operations in Singapore have obtained BizSAFE Level 3 certification for workplace 

health and safety. There were no cases of injuries, lost-time injuries and fatality recorded 

during the reporting year of 2017. We endeavour to maintain this record through 

continuous efforts of reviewing and managing risks at the workplace.

We have always conducted our business in a responsible manner towards the environment 

while adding value to our stakeholders. We believe that environmentally-friendly practices 

complement business efficiency. Employees are encouraged to reduce, reuse, recycle and 

advocate corporate social responsibility towards the environment. The use of recycled 

paper in office, oil trap controls and the proper disposal of scheduled wastes are 

encouraged to minimise pollution to the environment. 

 

We are committed to conduct our operations in accordance with the applicable 

environmental laws and regulations. The management assesses regulatory risks and takes 

preventive measures to ensure regulatory compliance. 

 

Energy Consumption 

We are committed to take measures to minimise our overall energy consumption and 

improve energy efficiency to reduce the environmental impact of our operations.  

Our utilities consumption for the period under review is presented below. We remind all 

employees regularly to switch off all lights, aircon and equipment when they leave the office 

to minimize energy consumption.

Effluents and Waste 

Our operational processes result in various forms of effluents and waste. We enforce 

stringent controls on the management of waste generated from our operations. All waste 

generated are collected by a licensed waste collector. At the same time, we strive to go 

beyond compliance by minimizing our waste and treating the waste responsibly before safe 

disposal. 

In the reporting year of 2017, there were no incidence of non-compliance with laws and 

regulations resulting in significant fines and we strive to maintain this record in the 

subsequent years. 

 

Supply Chain 

Supply chain is an integral aspect of our business. Raw materials are purchased from local 

suppliers and these products are transported to our plant to produce concrete and precast 

or sold through brokers, wholesalers, contractors and retailers. 

 

In line with our commitment to safeguard the environment, it is important for us to procure 

materials from suppliers with environmentally-friendly practices and from suppliers who 

remain compliant to rules and regulations such as fair labour practices and product 

governance.  

 

Product and Service Quality 

We have a stringent quality assurance system in place. All our products are manufactured 

according to industry standards and regular compliance review is conducted to ensure all 

our products receive proper certification of compliance. In the reporting year of 2017, we 

did not receive any formal complaints about our product or service quality, and we 

endeavour to maintain this clean record in the subsequent years.
