BOARD MESSAGE ON SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

The Group is pleased to present the 4th Sustainability Report for Hwa Hong Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries 

(“Hwa Hong”, “HHC”, or the “Group”). The Group continues to embark on its sustainability reporting journey for 

greater sustainable value creation in the areas of Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”). This effort has led 

the Group to work on ways to improve its value chain, combining its own actions with those of the service providers 

and joint venture partners, to create positive impacts.

In compliance with Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Rules 711A and 71B, the Board 

of Directors (the “Board”) has placed great importance on adopting a strategic approach in managing and overseeing 

the ESG matters that are significant to Hwa Hong as identified by the Board. The Board has also reviewed the 

sustainability performance of the organisation and will continue to provide guidance to the Management in defining 

future priorities.

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting global economic slowdown this year, Hwa Hong remains 

committed towards minimising the impacts of COVID-19 on our business and will continue to prioritise the  

well-being of all our stakeholders. Our response to COVID-19 is detailed in page 21 of this Report.

Together with the Management, the Board strives to promote greater resilience and sustainability in its business 

operations whilst engaging with all stakeholders of Hwa Hong.

ABOUT THIS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

REPORTING SCOPE AND STANDARDS

The Group’s 4th Sustainability Report is aimed at addressing non-financial matters in the aspects of ESG which are 

significant to the Group’s property investment operations in Singapore and UK1 (Figure 2). Unless otherwise stated, 

this Sustainability Report covers the period from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 (“FY2020”).

This Sustainability Report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of SGX-ST Listing Manual Rule 

711(B) and with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards 2016. The GRI Standards is a globally-

recognised framework and has been adopted for its universal application for reporting on ESG performance that 

allows for meaningful use of information and comparability in the market. In the preparation of the report, we have 

applied GRI’s reporting principles (Figure 3) for defining the content and quality of Hwa Hong’s Sustainability Report.

SUSTAINABILITY AT HWA HONG

RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUSTAINABILITY

At Hwa Hong, sustainability matters are governed by the Board which is supported by the Audit and Risk Committee 

(“ARC”) (Figure 4). This committee is responsible for integrating sustainability principles and policies, which comprise 

of relevant policies and standard operating procedures (“SOPs”) throughout the Group. Compliance with these 

policies and SOPs is effected through periodic reviews by the Board.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

The Management, together with the Board conducted a formal materiality assessment exercise in late 2016. An 

extensive list of ESG matters were evaluated and then ranked according to their importance from both internal and 

external stakeholders’ perspectives. 

A materiality review process was conducted in FY2020 and it was concluded that the same five material sustainability 

matters reported in the last year remains reflective of the current business condition and are aligned with the 

Group’s sustainability strategy (Figure 5). 

The material sustainability matters as detailed in Figure 62 will thus form the focus of this report and be reviewed on 

a yearly basis to ensure that they continue to be relevant and reflective of key business impacts and stakeholders’ 

needs. Future reviews will ensure a proactive response to emerging sustainability matters.

The Group did not identify any environmental matters such as energy and water consumption as material sustainability matters for its 

properties in Singapore and the UK as the usage of water and electricity are not within the Group’s control. The property managements in 

the Singapore properties are mainly carried out either by the Management Corporation Strata Title (“MCST”) or by the anchor tenant in its 

Paya Lebar property. In the UK, the commercial properties are leased on a full repair, insurance basis (“FRI”) whereby repairs and insurance 

are largely borne by the tenants and for the residential properties, repairs and maintenance costs are shared by all leaseholders.

HIGH STANDARDS OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

The Group recognises that good corporate governance and conducting of the business in a responsible and ethical 

manner is vital to the sustainability of the Group.

At Hwa Hong, the Board and the Company Secretary regularly reviews corporate governance practices, to ensure 

conformance with Singapore’s Code of Corporate Governance (the “Code”) 2018 and meet recommended best 

practices. Robustness of the Management’s governance of the Group is also monitored to ensure that they are 

attuned to the fast-moving economic landscape and regulatory requirements. 

As a testament to the Group’s commitment towards excellence in Corporate Governance, the Group has attained 

an overall improved score of 74 points this year in the Singapore Governance and Transparency Index (“SGTI”),  

which assesses companies on their corporate governance disclosure and practices, as well as, the timeliness, 

accessibility and transparency of their financial results’ announcement. This has moved the Group’s position from 

179th from the prior year to 174th in 2020. With this progressive achievement, the Group is encouraged to maintain, 

if not better its SGTI score going forward. 

RISK MANAGEMENT

The Group has established a formalised risk management process where risks, control measures, risk tolerance 

level or limits and follow-up actions are identified and monitored by the Management and reported to the Board 

for review and evaluation. During the risk management process, the Board determines acceptable levels of risk 

tolerance and policies to ensure that all identifiable material risks should be analysed, understood, managed and 

monitored. The Group believes that effective risk management is the responsibility of all directors and managers, 

with the Board providing general oversight. 

Every year, the Management carries out a review of the Group’s risk registers to update and identify new risks that 

may adversely affect the Group’s operations. A risk management report highlighting high risk areas or new risks and 

measures to mitigate such identified risks is submitted annually to the ARC for review and discussion. 

FUNDAMENTAL

HWA HONG CORPORATION LIMITED

FUNDAMENTAL

For the year under review, the Management believes that the current framework for managing risks remains 

appropriate. Although risks cannot be completely eliminated, an effective risk management framework will reduce 

the uncertainties in achieving the Group’s business objectives and allow the Group to take advantage of opportunities 

that may arise. Please refer to the Corporate Governance Report and Risk Management and Control Environment 

sections of the Annual Report.

ANTI-CORRUPTION, ANTI-BRIBERY 

The Group recognises the importance of good governance, anti-corruption and anti-bribery and adopts an integrated 

Fraud Risk Management Framework, designed to identify and minimise fraud occurrences within the Group.  

The Group adheres to the Code of Corporate Governance 2018 and listing rules and regulations set out by SGX and 

MAS Securities and Futures Act, as well as all other applicable laws and regulations. 

In addition, the Group expects its business partners, such as joint ventures and suppliers, to approach issues of 

corruption and bribery in a manner that is consistent with the Group’s principles. The Group will use its influence 

to ensure that business partners meet high integrity standards. The Group will also ensure that the procurement 

procedures for appointing suppliers are open, fair and transparent. The selection of suppliers will be based on 

evaluation of merits, and not on personal recommendations. 

Most of the Group’s investments are in developed markets such as Singapore and UK where there is very strong rule 

of law including anti-corruption laws. Where we have investments in emerging markets, the Group is careful that 

the investments are made with thorough due diligence. 

In support of an open and transparent communication culture, the Group has a whistle-blowing policy in place to 

provide an avenue for employees and external parties to raise concerns and offer reassurance that they will be 

protected from reprisals or victimisation for whistle blowing in good faith. The whistle-blowing policy is available on 

Hwa Hong’s website and details clear procedures for reporting. For FY2020 and FY2019, there were no confirmed 

cases of corruption.

FUNDAMENTAL

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

Any form of non-compliance could potentially damage the Group’s reputation and affect the confidence levels of 

the shareholders. It may also result in penalties such as fines, public warnings or reprimands from the regulators. 

The Group is also of the view that compliance with the applicable law and regulations is critical, so as to uphold 

Singapore’s reputation as a fair and reliable marketplace to conduct businesses.

The Group has established policies and SOPs to ensure that applicable regulations and legislation are complied with, 

which includes periodic self-testing, completing of routine compliance checklists and tracking of any regulatory 

breaches. In assessing the effectiveness of the management of regulatory compliance, the Group undergoes internal 

audits once every few years, conducted by an external accredited party. The auditor evaluates and provides an 

independent assessment on the robustness of the Group’s internal controls, risk management and corporate 

governance processes. All of which, provides an additional layer of review to ensure relevant regulatory requirements 

are met.

The last internal audit on regulatory management was carried out in FY2019. With recent enhancements to the 

Code’s disclosures and practices, the internal auditors carried out a gap analysis in FY2019 to assess for areas of 

potential non-compliance so that the Company can address them in a timely manner.

For FY2020 and FY2019, there were no known material incidents of non-compliance with applicable laws  

and regulations.

SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS GROWTH

SUSTAINING LONG-TERM FINANCIAL GROWTH AND PERFORMANCE 

Listed on the SGX-ST, Hwa Hong reports its financial performance on a half-yearly basis in FY2020. At the time of 

the release of this report, the most recent financial results released are for the financial year ended 31 December 

2020. Total revenue for the year was $10,310,652 and net profit was $4,161,245. As at 31 December 2020, 

Hwa Hong’s total investment properties achieved a valuation of $254,285,247 compared to its’ carrying value of 

$146,934,514.

Through a robust capital and asset management strategy, the Group focuses on investment opportunities that 

maximise shareholders’ value over the medium to long-term (Figure 8).

 

STRATEGIC

Hwa Hong recognises that encompassing a good governance structure, access to capital and due consideration 

for the broader economic and business environments in both Singapore and UK are vital for the execution of this 

strategy. 

To meet the commitment of maximising the value of its shareholders, Hwa Hong has developed and paced itself to 

achieve the following strategic objectives:

1.  

Acquire properties with long term value given their location and type of use

2.  

Unlock value from properties or develop sites over time to create value

3.  

Optimise income from assets

4.  

Recycle capital

5.  

Maintain strong, and efficient balance sheet (including ensuring sustainable loans-to-values (“LTVs”) and 

interest cover)

6.

STRATEGIC

In addition, the management further strives to strike a balance between the distribution of a consistent dividend to 

its shareholders and its pursuit of potential investment opportunities with the aim to maximise overall shareholders’ 

value. The dividend payout for a given year is determined by the Board of Directors, after taking into account, inter 

alia, the Group’s balance sheet position, operating results, capital requirements and cash balances. Over the years, 

Hwa Hong remained fairly consistent dividend in its pay-outs to shareholders.

SUCCESSION PLANNING

A fundamental responsibility of the Board is to ensure the continuity of executive leadership, as well as, to assess 

if the potential candidate possesses sufficient depth and talent to execute the Group’s long-term strategy whilst 

addressing both current and long-term needs of the Group.

The Group’s corporate governance and Nominating Committee’s terms of reference details the Board’s responsibilities 

in ensuring succession planning to meet current and future challenges and opportunities. These include ensuring 

effective processes are implemented, such as the following:

•  

Establishment of a process to identify and assess potential internal candidates; 

•  

Conduct periodic review and assessment of readiness;

•  

Implement contingency plans for temporary absences of the Chairman and Group Managing Director due to 

disability or unexpected event; and

•  

Ensure long-term continuity and planning for succession to the Group Managing Director’s position

The Board will assess such processes with the relevant committees on an annual basis. 

STRONG PARTNERSHIPS

From a geographical perspective, the Group continues to focus its property investments in its two key markets that 

are, Singapore and the UK. Given the Group’s small size and limited capital availability, the Group operates in the 

UK primarily through partnerships. As such, forging and maintaining strong partnerships for continued growth and 

sustainability is a key pillar of our sustainability strategy. 

The Group’s presence in UK has been longstanding and it continues to view London, and to a lesser extent, the UK, 

as a key overseas market for the Group. The Group believes the depth and liquidity of the London property market, 

in addition to, the transparency and the rule of law in the UK make the market attractive for foreign investors. 

Beginning in 2013, the Group has broadened its partnerships and resources in UK which has helped identify 

promising investment opportunities over time. Furthermore, this has managed to allow us to seize key investment 

opportunities to invest in properties for recurring income and potential long-term value creation.

In evaluating suitability for partnerships, the Group assesses largely on these criteria:

1.  

Potential partner’s profile and track record;

2.  

Potential partner’s previous partnership experience or reputation in the industry for new partnership;

 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

13




STRATEGIC

Hwa Hong further considers several key process issues which are deemed vital in achieving optimal partnership 

outcomes. These process issues include:

1.  

Creating a shared vision on the investments;

2.  

Agreeing on terms upfront with robust and thorough legal agreements;

3.  

Regular monitoring of the investment;

4.  

Ensuring that dispute resolution is agreed upfront

With the above approach, the Group has managed to foster and maintain amicable and professional relationships 

with its partners, in which Hwa Hong believes will create opportunities for future investments.

INFLUENCING HWA HONG’S SUPPLY CHAIN 

Sustainability impacts occur at every aspect of the business and extends beyond the Group’s operations. Hwa 

Hong is committed to influence its value chain in sustainability matters. The Group’s main suppliers are property 

and project management service providers and professional service providers. In areas where the Group is in joint 

operations with joint-venture partners, the Group has varying degrees of control and influence over its property and 

project management service providers. 

Hence, where relevant and practicable, the Group actively engages the property and project manager and related 

service providers for collaboration to create a positive sustainability impact. To that end, Hwa Hong works closely 

with the property operators to undertake appropriate and adequate risk management procedures during the 

sourcing and procurement process of materials and services. For example, where relevant, only service providers 

verified to have the required license are allowed to carry out maintenance work and fitting-out works in the 

Group’s properties.

STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS

Hwa Hong and its stakeholders in building a business that is sustainable and primed for growth, this has driven

ASPIRATIONAL

FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES

At Hwa Hong, the recruitment and career progressions follow a meritocratic approach. The Group believes in 

the provision of fair and equitable opportunities for our team members to grow professionally, and stands firm 

against any form of discrimination within the Group. Human resource and employment policies which aligns 

with the Fair Consideration Framework of the Ministry of Manpower and the five key principles defined by the 

Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (“TGFEP”) are in place to guide the Group as well as protect 

the team members.

These five key principles by TGFEP are:

Recruit and select team members on the basis of merit (such as skills, experience or ability to perform the job), 

regardless of age, race, gender, religion, marital status and family responsibilities, or disability.

Treat team members fairly and respectfully and implement progressive human resource management systems.

Provide employees with equal opportunities to be considered for training and development based on their 

strengths and needs, to help them achieve their full potential. 

Reward employees fairly based on their ability, performance, contribution and experience.

Abide by labour laws and adopt the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices.

At Hwa Hong, the recruitment and career progressions follow a meritocratic approach. The Group remains highly 

committed in treating all team members fairly and equally. For example, the Group provides opportunities for senior 

citizens who have in turn, demonstrated good knowledge and loyalty to the Group.

As Hwa Hong has a lean workforce, the Group recognises that talent attraction and retention is an important aspect. 

Team members are identified as the Group’s most valuable assets and are continuously engaged. The Group views 

the importance of training, developing, growing and retaining its human capital through implementation of effective 

human resource policies and practices. The team members are encouraged to upskill themselves by getting trained 

for career growth and personal development.

ASPIRATIONAL

In addition, the Group offers competitive pay packages that are benchmarked to the market and reward team 

members based on merit. The Group’s remuneration package generally comprises two components. One component 

is fixed in the form of a base salary. The other is a variable component comprising Annual Wage Supplement (“AWS”) 

and performance bonus. The variable component is largely dependent on the Group’s financial performance as well 

as the individual’s performance for the year.

Furthermore, Hwa Hong regards its team members’ well-being as its top priority. Positive well-being is believed to 

lower turnover rates and increase productivity. The Group focuses on providing a safe and conducive workplace for 

its team members. Various healthcare benefits, such as health insurance and health screenings are further provided 

to full-time team members. The Group strives to build a working environment that meets the needs of its team 

members wherever possible. Provision of additional leave days and flexible working arrangements are granted 

additionally, to allow team members to focus on their personal commitments as necessary. 

The Group believes in integrity and professionalism in the conduct of Hwa Hong’s business activities and expects 

the team members to embrace, practice and adopt these values as communicated. The Group’s code of conduct is 

made available to all team members as embedded within the employment policy.

COVID-19 has brought about unprecedented depths of economic disruption worldwide, and Hwa Hong’s business 

has been affected by this global health crisis. Due to slowdowns across the construction industry in Singapore,  

our development project at 253 Jalan Besar has experienced delays, and the decrease in daily footfall within central 

London due to lockdown measures has also impacted our commercial properties, though our residential portfolio 

continues to perform satisfactorily. The Group foresees long term value in our investment properties in Singapore 

and the United Kingdom, and we will continue to build resilience and re-invest strategically to capture long term 

value and seek new opportunities. Please see our Annual Report 2020 for more information on our business review 

and prospects.

As the Group took steps to mitigate the wide-ranging impacts of the pandemic on our operations, we continue 

to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of our stakeholders. In Singapore, when COVID-19 restrictions kicked 

in during the early months of 2020, we took direction from the Ministry of Manpower’s (“MOM’s”) advisories to 

implement measures that reduce the spread of COVID-19 at the workplace, and continue to support the virtual 

communication with customers, suppliers and staff. There were no non-compliance incidents or breaches of  

safe-distancing and the relevant COVID-19 workplace safety measures in FY2020. 

The key highlights of our response towards COVID-19 for our various stakeholders are as described below:

Stakeholder

Hwa Hong’s response

Tenants

Hwa Hong is committed to helping tenants tide through the circumstances brought 

about due to COVID-19. 

COVID-19 resulted in a tenant in one of our UK properties going into administration 

during FY2020. Lease terms have been restructured at 20 Midtown property and the 

property continues to be more than 95% occupancy let albeit at lower rents. All other 

properties remain at 100% occupancy rate.

Investors  

(i.e. equity 

shareholders)

The Company continues to ensure that shareholders and investors are kept abreast of 

significant COVID-19 impacts and are provided timely updates. 

In Singapore, Hwa Hong convened and held a “live” webcast Annual General Meeting on 

22 May 2020 during the Circuit Breaker period for FY2019 and another “live” webcast 

on 23 April 2021 during Phase 3 of Singapore’s gradual reopening of the economy 

for FY2020. The Group seeks to strengthen shareholder confidence and corporate 

accountability in keeping abreast with the updated guidelines and advisories from the 

regulatory bodies.

Board of Directors and 

the Management

The Group has reduced face-to-face meetings and arranged for virtual communication 

to the furthest extent possible.

During the Circuit Breaker period in Singapore, all meetings were facilitated through 

virtual communication. After the lockdown period was over, hybrid meetings were 

arranged, with physical attendance contained within the limit allowed alongside 

virtual communication.

Stakeholder

Hwa Hong’s response

Team members

Employee safety is a priority for Hwa Hong and we continue to safeguard their  

well-being, communicating of new internal policies and safe workplace guidelines by 

MOM via regular emails from the Management. We continue to encourage flexible 

working hours and encouraged employees to adopt work from home arrangements to 

the furthest extent possible. 

In the office, the Group has also taken the following measures to protect our employees, 

but not limited to:

• Institution of safe distancing measures 

• Provision of thermometers, hand sanitisers and face masks at our office premises

• Increasing frequency of cleaning and sanitization of common office areas 

• Implementation of mandatory use of Safe Entry system for all employees entering 

office for contact tracing purposes and twice-daily temperature checks 

• Restricting face-to-face meetings or employee gatherings

• Enforcing masks to be worn at all times during working hours

Suppliers  

(i.e Property 

Management and 

professional service 

providers)

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the Group’s development plan for 253 Jalan 

Besar. The construction of this property was delayed due to foreign worker dormitory 

lockdowns, closed borders and manpower shortage. Hwa Hong expects that the 

property will receive its temporary occupation limit in FY2021 barring any unforeseen 

circumstances.

Government/

Regulators

In response to the pandemic, the local government has introduced various support 

schemes to alleviate the impact of Covid-19 on Hwa Hong such as Property tax rebate, 

Jobs Support Scheme (“JSS”) and Job Growth Incentive (“JGI”).

Hwa Hong has also complied to all government regulations for the regions in which 

we operate.

Moving forward, the Group is focused on building strength and staying resilient amidst the new challenges that have 

arose from the pandemic. Hwa Hong is confident that we will emerge stronger from COVID-19 as we continue to 

capture new growth opportunities and focus on growing our business sustainably.
