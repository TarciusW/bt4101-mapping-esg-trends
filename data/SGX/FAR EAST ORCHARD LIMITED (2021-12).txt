Board Statement

Dear Stakeholders,

2021 was a year of adjustments and 

adaptations, 

as 

businesses 

and 

countries grappled with the ongoing 

challenges posed by COVID-19. At 

Far East Orchard, as the Group rides 

out the pandemic, its paramount 

concerns were the mental well-being 

and physical health and safety of its 

employees, guests, and stakeholders, 

in addition to the sustainability of its 

business. During the year, we had 

taken calculated steps to navigate 

through headwinds and to better equip 

ourselves for a post-COVID world.

Sustainability is one of the key focus 

on the Board’s agenda. We believe it 

is essential to embed sustainability 

into the core of its business as 

the Group commit ourselves to 

creating a sustainable future for the 

generations to come. With that, the 

Board is pleased to introduce Far 

East Orchard’s new sustainability 

vision: “We strive to create sustained 

economic value for our stakeholders 

and 

commit 

to 

be 

responsible 

towards the environment and society 

while upholding a high standard of 

corporate governance. Together, we 

work towards creating a sustainable 

future through our real estate and 

lodging platform.” Going forward, 

this vision will serve as a bedrock for 

the Group.

Apart from the five SDGs identified 

last year, the Group made progress 

in advancing its sustainability efforts 

and disclosures. In 2021, the Group 

refreshed its ESG topics by measuring 

and disclosing its carbon footprint 

within the Group’s portfolio, as this 

helps us to understand its environmental and social 

impact. The Group intends to provide relevant information 

on climate-related disclosures in the near term. The Group 

is also pleased to share its first SLL framework that guides 

organisational efforts to embed sustainability in financial 

strategies. In December 2021, the Group secured its first 

SLL, a four-year £50 million credit facility to be used for 

general working capital purposes and acquisitions of PBSA 

properties in the UK. This is an important milestone in Far 

East Orchard’s sustainability journey to create long-term 

value for stakeholders.

The Group's sustainability efforts in 2021 demonstrated 

the Board’s commitment to entrenching ESG into its 

business operations. The Board is responsible for setting 

sustainability direction for the Group, providing oversight 

and management of ESG risks and opportunities. Working 

closely with the ARC and the MRSC, comprising Far East 

Orchard's management, the Board guides the setting 

and monitoring of material ESG factors that impact 

stakeholders and our operations.

As the global sustainability landscape continues to evolve, the 

Group anticipates that organisations like ours will be playing  a 

greater role in meeting the needs of stakeholders and tackling 

environmental challenges. As the Group progresses on this 

sustainability journey, we thank you for supporting us while the 

Group strives to deliver a positive impact for all stakeholders.

Refresh of Sustainability Strategy

The global sustainability landscape is evolving amid increasing 

challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change. 

2021 saw an increased urgency globally for countries and corporations 

to make significant efforts to reduce emissions and increase support 

for global sustainable development agendas. Furthermore, the 

pandemic also placed a spotlight on the importance for businesses 

to stay relevant in an ever-evolving environment by ensuring business 

resiliency and agility, to continue delivering value and sustainable 

returns to all stakeholders.

In 2021, the Group updated its sustainability strategy to better reflect its 

commitment to global sustainability efforts. The Group aims to make 

meaningful contributions toward selected SDG targets. More details on 

the Group’s approach and commitment can be found in the report.

Continuous Support for National 

COVID-19 Safety Measures

In response to shifts in business operations 

due to COVID-19, the Group has taken 

significant measures to keep employees, 

guests, and stakeholders safe on its 

premises. The Group has adhered to 

all national guidelines and regulatory 

requirements relating to workplace safety 

in all the markets it operates in and where 

suitable, implemented additional safety 

measures across all properties.

Please refer to page 26-27 for a more 

detailed explanation of COVID-19 measures 

undertaken by the Group.

Materiality Assessment

Annually, the Group reviews material topics in 

consultation with internal and external stakeholders to 

ensure the relevance of these ESG topics.

In 2021, Far East Orchard worked with an external 

partner to review material ESG topics, following the 

guidance of the GRI Standards and referencing 

industry best practices. The Group took a proactive 

materiality lens to evaluate material ESG topics, 

considering ESG issues that may impact operations 

in the immediate future and the long term, as well 

as the environmental and social impact on the wider 

society. To determine the importance of these topics 

to the Group’s business, we consulted with external 

stakeholders during roadshows held throughout the 

year. These material ESG topics were also discussed

Minimising Environmental Impact

As a leading real estate company with a lodging platform, 

the Group recognises that it has a significant role 

to protect environmental resources and advance 

sustainability efforts in the hospitality and PBSA sectors. 

This will be acheived by adopting a best practice 

approach to reduce the environmental footprint of its 

properties and promote sustainable practices across 

the value chain.

As first step, the Group is reviewing its current 

environmental initiatives and policies across its 

hospitality, PBSA and property development and 

property investment business segments. This allows 

the Group to consolidate current efforts and develop 

new initiatives to meet its commitment to reducing 

environmental footprint over the next few years.

In 2021, Far East Orchard worked with an external 

partner to develop a GHG emissions inventory to track

Owned and managed properties are categorised separately as Far East Orchard has a varying degree of control over these assets. 

The degree of control would determine the extent of environmental initiatives the Group can implement to reduce emissions.

 

For owned properties, the Group has operational control over fuel and electricity purchase decisions and significant control over the 

decision-making process of practices and policies that can influence consumption (including capital expenditures).

 

For managed properties, the Group has some operational control over the daily practices that influence the consumption of fuel 

and electricity (e.g. the type of refrigerant, turning on/off lights) but does not have significant control over purchasing decisions and 

capital expenditures (e.g. purchase of equipment, cost chargeable by the fuel provider and electricity provider, choice of lighting).

3 

Far East Orchard uses the operational approach in the calculation of GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2) in accordance with the GHG 

Protocol Standards. The emission factors used are derived from the UK Defra environmental reporting guidelines, aligned to the 

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change approach.

4 

Far East Orchard owned and managed properties are described on the ‘About this Report’ page. This includes properties in Singapore, 

Malaysia, Japan and the UK. Far East Orchard's emission scope is reviewed on a yearly basis.

5 

Scope 1 carbon emissions consist of direct emissions from diesel used in backup generators, gas used in kitchens or kitchenettes and 

fugitive emissions from refrigerants.

6 

Scope 1 carbon emissions data for managed properties were not included in the current carbon emission data as fuel-related 

activities were managed by external partners. Far East Orchard is in the process of consolidating Scope 1 carbon emissions data for 

managed properties and will report the data in due course.

7 

Scope 2 gas includes indirect emissions from electricity usage in hotels and PBSAs. The Group uses the location-based approach to 

calculate emissions from electricity consumption.

the Group's environmental footprint and set an initial 

absolute emission reduction target of 1% annually 

from FY2022 onwards. These efforts will provide a 

baseline for the Group to refresh its  carbon reduction 

targets in the coming years. Its performance will be 

monitored closely by the Board and management.

Going forward, the Group will progressively roll out 

environmental initiatives and will adopt wider emission 

reduction targets with guidance from the Board.

Carbon Management

The Group tracks carbon emissions across all owned 

and managed properties within the hospitality and 

PBSA portfolios2. It has excluded some properties 

that are not fully owned or are not managed by the 

Group, as it has little operational control over the 

daily practices, purchasing decisions and capital 

expenditures for these properties.

with internal stakeholders, taking into consideration 

the impact on business operations. The refreshed 

material ESG topics were then endorsed by the Far 

East Orchard’s Board and management.

Through the assessment, the Group refreshed its ESG 

topics to reflect a greater emphasis on carbon and 

water management as well as diversity issues. This 

is aligned with the current global environmental and 

social context, such as the Singapore Green Plan 2030 

and COP26 which shone light on the importance of 

climate action to create a sustainable future as well as 

regulatory requirements which placed higher emphasis 

on the need for greater diversity within an organisation.

Disclosures on the 10 material topics will be elaborated 

in the next sections of the report.

Minimising Environmental Impact

Most of its emissions come from electricity consumption 

from hotel operations. The Group's absolute emissions 

rose year-on-year in 2020 and 2021 due to the addition 

of five new hotels to its managed properties portfolio in 

the last quarter of 2019.

Additionally, the rise in emissions can be attributed to 

changes in the Group’s PBSA portfolio and operations, 

Although total electricity consumption increased 

by 7% in 2021 compared to 2020, its energy intensity 

remained the same, which is the result of more 

energy-efficient measures in place at the five new 

hotels. The Group will continue to implement new 

initiatives, including working with third-party owners 

to reduce emissions in its current properties.

which includes the acquisition of King Square Studios in 

2020 as well as changes to the leasing profile for the 

Bristol properties. Strong market demand resulted in an 

increase in leasing weeks for the Group’s PBSA. COVID-19 

lockdown regulations also contributed to the increase 

in absolute emissions at the Group’s PBSA properties, as 

a higher proportion of students spent more time in the 

PBSA properties.



Minimising Environmental Impact

For the Group’s managed properties portfolio, it has set out 

two key strategies to reduce environmental impact, namely:



Properties

Minimising Environmental Impact

The Group is dedicated to ensuring 

that its properties under the hospitality 

and PBSA segment are developed and 

maintained in a manner that is as 

environmentally conscious as possible. 

In the last few years, it prioritised 

working with partners to implement 

environmental initiatives such as solar 

power systems.

In reducing the environmental impact of 

operations, three of the Group’s Singapore 

managed properties were Green Mark 

certified by BCA in 2021 and the Group 

targets to achieve Green Mark for an 

additional seven managed properties in 

2022 (Figure 3). The Group endeavours 

to improve energy efficiency and reduce 

emissions across all properties.

All of the Group's PBSA properties have an Energy 

Performance Certificate Rating of 'C' or better. Going 

forward, the Group and its PBSA operator, Abodus, 

have established a Sustainable Construction and 

Refurbishment Strategy to ensure new PBSA building 

developments in the UK and refurbishments of 

existing PBSA properties would include sustainable 

construction principles. The Group believes this would 

reduce its carbon footprint in the long term.

In 2019 and 2020, the Group expanded its property portfolio. In FY2021, the Group decided to relook and expand its water data 

collection to include the new properties and close any data gap. The water data scope in 2021 was not available for previous years, 

as such, we will only be providing water performance data from 2021 onwards.

• 

Tapping on Singapore’s Public Utilities Board’s 

Water Efficiency Fund to assess our water efficiency 

and identify opportunities for improvement in 

water efficiency

• 

Employee training and raising awareness of all 

employees on water consumption and conservation

The Group will continue to make improvements and 

implement new water-saving initiatives across its 

properties to optimise water usage.

Minimising Environmental Impact

Waste (non-material)

The Group continuously seeks to innovate and adopt 

new initiatives to minimise waste generated at its 

properties. For example, at the newer hotels, plastic 

bottled water is no longer supplied, instead, water for 

guest consumption is now provided in reusable glass 

bottles. It also actively engages in partnerships with 

local start-ups and organisations such as UglyFood in 

Singapore by purchasing “less presentable” but perfectly 

edible food to educate guests on food wastage.

In addition to minimising the amount of waste generated, 

the Group also aims to maximise the recycling rate 

at all its hospitality and PBSA properties. For the PBSA 

properties, recycling bins are provided for the recycling 

of paper, glass, and food waste. The Group works with 

its PBSA operator, Abodus, to explore alternative waste 

collection options and partners with waste management 

contractors to increase the recycling rate.

Environmental compliance (non-material)

The Group takes a firm approach to compliance 

with regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in 

which it operates in. It recognises the importance of 

conducting an environmental impact assessment 

to evaluate the potential impact of the business 

operation of the enviroment and to ensure compliance 

with all environmental regulations. It intends to 

implement an environmental management policy in 

the future, especially in higher-risk areas where its 

business is operating in.

The Group conducts periodic reviews of its business 

practices to ensure that any non-compliant matters 

are promptly addressed. The whistle-blowing policy 

established also helps in identifying and rectifying 

any potential issues. In FY2021, the Group did not incur 

any significant fines or non-monetary penalties for 

non-compliance with environmental regulations.

Supporting People

The Group strives to create value for guests, 

students, employees, and other partners, in line 

with its sustainability strategy. It has in place 

extensive policies and procedures to ensure that 

employees can provide a safe environment for 

guests and students at the properties. It also 

focuses on providing an inclusive and supportive 

work environment for employees to reach their 

fullest 

potential 

in 

their 

career 

aspirations.

At the Group’s hospitality properties, comprehensive measures are undertaken to ensure the safety and 

well-being of all hotel guests. These measures include:

Occupational Health and Safety

The Group has a Group-wide WSH policy that governs 

key initiatives (Figure 5) as well as procedures for 

dealing with workplace hazards. This policy is set 

and reviewed by the WSH Committee and is strictly 

enforced by the WSH personnel at each property. The 

WSH Committee reports to the MRSC.

The Group's WSH policy aims to provide employees 

with a safe and healthy working environment. All 

new employees undergo mandatory training on WSH 

policy during their induction period. Employees also 

make an annual declaration with a WSH commitment 

whereby they commit to a Safety Pledge to help 

create a safer workplace and to comply with the 

WSH policy as outlined in the Employee Handbook.



Key Initiatives Under WSH Policy

• Establish and update of the WSH risk register

• Review WSH policy and objectives at least once a year

• Adopt safe working practices that are in accordance with national and international 

safety regulations

• Conduct quarterly WSH risk assessments by the WSH Committee to proactively 

identify hazardous activities and workspaces, and put mitigation measures in place. 

Employees will be alerted to any newly identified hazardous activities and relevant 

mitigation measures will be implemented in the workplace. Newly identified hazardous 

activities will be updated in the workplace safety risk register

• Annual review of the Group’s risk register with new incidents to be updated and shared 

across all properties by the individual risk assessment committee and MRSC

WSH Committee’s 

responsibilities

• Daily morning briefing on WSH for hospitality employees

• Fortnightly circulation of reminders about WSH to all employees to increase awareness 

and inculcate safe work habits

• Conduct emergency drills for potentially hazardous situations, including but not 

limited to power failures, medical emergencies, fires, and lift entrapments, at least 

twice a year

Enforcement at each 

property

• Maintain a recognised WSH management system

• Appointment of a WSH representative with at least a bizSAFE Level 2 certificate, to be 

responsible for handling WSH matters and implementation of WSH policies at each 

property. This includes the review of work activities, determining the likelihood of risks 

arising from these work activities, reviewing WSH trends and updating the WSH risk 

register

• Formation of Emergency Response Teams who are equipped with safety equipment 

to perform emergency responses

• Engage certified Fire Safety Managers to evaluate the fire safety measures deployed 

within the in-scope hospitality properties

• Annual reviews of operational risks through the Asbestos Management Plan or the 

Legionella Risk Assessment to ensure that building-related environmental compliance 

is adequately addressed

In FY2021, the Group maintained its 

track record of zero workplace fatalities 

and occupational disease cases at 

the hospitality properties for the fourth 

consecutive year. During the same 

period, a total of 42 work-related injuries, 

including one case of high consequence 

work-related injury, were recorded.

The Group’s AFR increased from 4.7 in 

FY2020 to 20.4 in FY2021 and the ASR 

increased from 72.1 in FY2020 to 259.5 in 

FY2021. Due to the lockdown in FY2020, 

there was a reduction in operations 

and therefore a lower number of 

workplace injuries. As operations began 

to ramp-up in FY2021, correspondingly 

the number of workplace injuries also 

increased. Therefore, its FY2021 target 

of reducing the number of workplace 

injuries by 25% was not met. The Group 

is taking concerted efforts across all 

properties to reduce workplace injuries 

and ensure the safety of its employees.

evaluates any incidents at its hospitality properties. 

Recurrences of incidents are prevented and minimised 

through the conduct of a root cause analysis, and the 

sharing of lessons learnt from these incidents with all 

employees to increase their awareness about WSH. The 

Group will continue to work closely with all employees to 

ensure compliance with all health and safety measures 

implemented.





2022 Target

Key Initiatives to Support Targets

• Conduct regular safety training

• Collaborate with local authorities to organise emergency drills for potentially

Singapore

The COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe in 

2020, caused major disruptions to businesses and 

industries all over the world. To ensure minimal impact 

on the Group’s operations, Business Continuity Plans 

were enforced in addition to safe workplace measures.

In 2021, new and enhanced safety measures were 

introduced under the ‘Far More Assured’ initiative scheme 

at the Group’s managed hotels and serviced residences 

to ensure the safety and well-being of guests and 

employees at our properties. Examples include increased 

frequency of deep cleaning of public areas and high 

touchpoint surfaces as well as ensuring each room is fully 

disinfected at the end of each guest’s stay. Additionally, 

all the Group’s managed hotels are certified with the 

SG Clean quality mark issued by Singapore’s National 

Environmental Agency, which reflects the Group’s 

commitment to adopting measures to provide a clean 

and safe environment for all guests and employees.

In addition, the Group also introduced the ‘Zero-

touch’ initiative to reduce the spread of COVID-19. 



Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic

This includes hotels offering virtual precinct tours, 

having self check-in kiosks, offering guests the 

option of contactless payments and using QR codes 

to host information. It is working towards rolling 

out a Contactless Web-Based Technology across 

all hospitality properties between 2022 to 2023 to 

provide a contactless experience for all guests from 

pre-registration to check out.

Far East Orchard also complies with all applicable 

regulatory requirements to ensure employees can 

continue to work in a safe working environment. 

Where possible, internal and external meetings 

were conducted virtually to minimise the number of 

employees at the workplace. For all physical meetings 

conducted, the number of attendees is limited, and 

safe distancing is always observed.

Abodus, received the COVID-19 assurance statement 

from the British Safety Council in November 2020, which 

reflects the Group’s commitment to maintaining the 

highest level of health and safety. Each PBSA property 

has dedicated site teams, sanitation stations and 

heightened cleaning schedules.

Abodus offers a range of self-help resources, including 

a COVID-19 handbook, to support students and guide 

them on how to maintain their health and safety. 

The resources create awareness for students on the 

different health and safety protocols as well as what 

to do in the event they feel ill.

Training and Education

The Group recognises that employees are the 

foundation of the success of its operations. As such, 

it invests in training development programmes, 

cultivating the abilities of employees to ensure they 

have the necessary skill sets to navigate challenges  

and remain relevant in the changing business 

landscape. This enables the Group to retain a 

competitive edge and enhance its brand profile.

The HR team enhances the capabilities of employees 

by fostering inter-department learning, providing 

opportunities 

to 

be 

mentored, 

and 

networking 

opportunities, as well as providing professional and 

leadership development opportunities. In FY2021, 

management and various employees undertook 

sustainability training, which included modules on 

sustainability frameworks, strategies and carbon 

emission standards.

Creating a learning culture where employees feel valued 

and take pride in carrying out their work, will contribute 

to the success of the organisation and enhance overall 

business performance. Figure 9 highlights the Group’s

Going forward, the Group will continue to work towards implementing new training programmes to equip 

employees with the necessary knowledge and skills. This will be accompanied by a training and development 

target of 80 hours per annum for 2022.

With an average of 85.7 hours 

of training recorded for each 

employee in 2021, the Group 

exceeded 

its 

2021 

target 

of 

achieving an average of 80 

hours of training per employee. 

However, the recorded training 

hours in 2021 was lower compared 

to 2020 because of the restrictions 

from the COVID-19 pandemic on 

conducting in-person training.





2022 Target

Key Initiatives to Support Targets

• Conduct training for employees via varied modes of learning

• Roll out compulsory e-learning courses and additional courses including:

o PDPA

o Mental Wellness

o Cybersecurity

Maintain a minimum of

80 HOURS



of training per 

employee per annum

At Far East Orchard, emphasis is not only placed on 

employees’ professional development, but also on 

personal development. The Group believes that the 

individual development of employees is important in 

the creation of a value-driven organisation.

To 

evaluate 

employees’ 

achievements 

and 

development against goals set at the beginning 

of the financial year, it has in place a continuous 

performance management process that enables 

employees to review and monitor their personal 

development and growth throughout the year.

The Group supports continuous performance reviews 

and 

conversations. 

Employees 

and 

supervisors 



Performance Management and Talent Development

engage in meaningful conversations to review work 

performance progress, development, and feedback 

in each quarter. The year-end performance appraisal 

facilitates managers and employees to review their 

achievements and contributions to the Group for the 

year. This whole process is accelerated by the Group’s 

dedicated eAppraisal system, which provides visibility 

and structure to monitor and review all documented 

goals, achievements, and feedback.

In FY2021, 100% of its employees received a regular 

performance and career development review. For 

FY2022, the Group aims to maintain its performance 

and ensure 100% of all employees receive guidance 

and support to reach their aspirations.

In 2021, each employee received an 

average of 85.7 hours of training.

Diversity and Equal Opportunity

Far East Orchard, takes a holistic view of diversity and 

believes that diversity is a wide-ranging concept 

that covers aspects such as industry knowledge, 

professional experience, educational qualifications, 

interpersonal and problem-solving skills, gender, 

age, 

ethnicity, 

nationality, 

independence, 

and 

length of service, amongst others. The Group values 

diversity and believe in the importance of driving 

innovation and inspiring creativity in the workplace, 

to ensure continued business growth in a competitive  

global marketplace.

Having diversity on the Board is vital as it boosts 

decision-making capabilities. In 2018, Far East Orchard 

established a Board Diversity Policy, setting out two 

specific targets addressing gender and age. The age 

target is to have directors of different age ranges so 

that the Board will not comprise of directors only in a 

particular age band. The gender target is for women 

to comprise at least 20% of the Board. Both targets 

were met and maintained throughout FY2021 and to 

date. The Board comprises Directors of various ages 

ranging from 40s to 70s. In terms of gender diversity, 

3 of the 7 Directors or 42.8% of the Board (in FY2021), 

and 4 of the 9 Directors or 44.4% (as of the date of 

this report) are women. More details are set out in 

the Corporate Governance section of its FY2021  

Annual Report.

The Group had 137 new hires and 276 

turnovers in FY2021, which translates to 

a new hire and turnover rate of 14.6% 

and 29.5% respectively. It recognises the 

importance of employee retention and 

seek to implement new initiatives as well 

as strictly follow the TAFEP guidelines on 

fair employment practices to create a 

work environment where each employee 

feels 

valued 

and 

respected. 

The 

breakdown of new hires and turnover by 

gender and age group are as shown:

Recruitment of new employees and access to career opportunities are purely based on merit, and not one’s 

gender, nationality, or age group.

As of 31 December 2021, the Group employed a total of 937 employees14, of which 405 or 43.2% are male and 532

the oversight and monitoring of the whistle-blowing 

arrangements, while the Group’s internal auditors 

(an independent professional firm) assist the ARC 

with the enforcement of the whistle-blowing policy. In 

accordance with the Group’s whistle-blowing policy,

Key Initiatives to be Continued/Implemented

• Training to educate employees on data privacy regulations and their role in 

compliance

• Regular review of business processes to facilitate compliance with data privacy 

regulations

No substantiated

Customer Privacy

With the increased digitalisation of services, data 

security is becoming a key issue. The Group has put in 

place policies and processes to safeguard the privacy 

of customers' personal information and commits to 

comply with all applicable data protection laws.

For example, personal information collected from 

guests who stay at hospitality properties managed 

by the Group will strictly be used and disclosed for 

registration and stay purposes only. The Group does 

not divulge or sell customers’ personal information to 

third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.

Upholding customer privacy is of utmost importance to 

the Group, and key initiatives have been implemented 

throughout the organisation to manage customers’ 

personal information:

• Appointment of DPOs for each business unit who 

maintains and monitors each business unit’s 

compliance with the relevant data protection 

legislation

• Regular 

monitoring 

of 

business 

processes 

and security procedures to assess and ensure 

compliance with relevant data protection laws

• Periodic reviews and updates to manuals and 

policies to ensure relevancy, including the 

Information Security and Management Policy, 

Privacy Policy, and a manual for employees to 

inculcate awareness of, and facilitate compliance 

with, applicable data protection laws

• Maintaining a data inventory map to facilitate 

effective record management

• Taking measures to comply with the advisory 

guidelines relating to the National Registration 

Identity Card and other national identification 

numbers issued by Singapore’s PDPC

• Taking measures to comply with other relevant 

regional and/or national guidelines, including 

the European Union's General Data Protection 

Regulation and the UK's Data Protection Act 2018

Employees are provided with a manual to familiarise 

themselves with the data protection policies. The 

manual is updated based on proposed changes to 

the PDPA of Singapore to ensure its relevance, with 

the latest review and update being done in the last 

quarter of FY2021. Annually, employees are required to 

go through an e-learning course on data protection.

The Group’s Privacy Policy can be found at 

www.fareastorchard.com.sg/privacy-policy.html 

and the DPOs can be contacted by email at  

dpo@fareastorchard.com.sg.

In FY2021, there were no substantiated complaints 

concerning breaches of customer privacy and loss of 

customer data that resulted in fines by the PDPC.



2022 Target

Conduct an annual review, where at least THREE



 random suppliers are selected to 

report on their sustainability efforts and progress as compared to the previous year

Responsible Procurement

The Group relies on suppliers and partners to 

support 

its 

hospitality 

and 

PBSA 

operations, 

therefore having a sustainable supply chain can 

increase 

its 

productivity 

and 

efficiency 

while 

managing operational risks. As such, the Group is 

committed to upholding responsible practices by 

prioritising working with socially and environmentally 

responsible business partners at its operations. In 

assessing new partnerships with external parties, its 

takes into consideration their geographical location 

and the environmental impact of the relevant 

logistics. In FY2021, more than 70% of its suppliers and 

distributors supplying to its hospitality operations 

are locally based, which reduced the environmental 

impact arising from logistics, and allowed it to 

support local businesses.

To ensure sustainability is embedded across the 

supply chain, the Group aims to educate stakeholders 

and suppliers about its sustainability beliefs and 

encourage them to adopt sustainable practices. For 

example, contractors are encouraged to source raw 

materials from sustainable sources and incorporate 

an eco-conscious construction process in its 

development projects.

The Group has incorporated environmental and 

social considerations into its procurement policies 

to minimise potential disruption to its operations. 

The hospitality procurement policy outlines ESG 

criteria that suppliers must adhere to. As part of 

the assessment list when considering suppliers, it 

ensures that all suppliers comply with applicable 

laws and regulations. The Group also prioritises 

suppliers who have certification in safe working 

environment, responsible labour practices as well as 

sustainable forestry and animal welfare.

In 2021, 100% of the Group's suppliers fully complied 

with its procurement policy.

Economic Performance

In FY2021, the Group recorded revenue of S$106.8 

million, 

a 

4.8% 

decline 

year-on-year, 

mainly 

attributable to the Group’s hospitality business being 

impacted by the protracted COVID-19 pandemic as 

well as the ongoing lockdowns and border closures 

which impeded international travel and tourism. 

The decline was partially mitigated by the demand 

for accommodation facilities for isolation purposes 

and from companies for accommodation for their 

foreign workers in Singapore. Net profit increased to 

S$16.8 million in FY2021, reversing the net loss of S$8.9 

million in FY2020, primarily due to fair value gains on 

investment properties.
