BOARD STATEMENT

MindChamps Preschool Limited (“MindChamps”) is pleased to present our Sustainability Report (this “Report”) for 

the financial year ended 31 December 2020 (“FY2020”). 

At MindChamps, we strongly believe in the potential of education to drive positive social change. This belief 

gives us the impetus to move forward dynamically, as we strive for excellence in leadership and expertise. The 

vision of our organisation to revolutionise education is becoming a global reality. In Singapore, MindChamps 

has established its position as the Number One provider of premium preschool centres1, and we continue to 

transform and grow each day.  

As the Board of Directors (the “Board”), we recognise the importance of sustainability and seek to contribute to 

our environment and society through our business activities as a responsible corporate citizen. 

We are supported by the Sustainability Task Force (“STF”), which is comprised of C-suite and senior management, 

to ensure that MindChamps’ sustainability initiatives are aligned with the long-term business strategy of taking the 

MindChamps education movement from Singapore to the world. Through the STF, we oversee the management 

and monitoring of the Environamental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors. 

In FY2020, a newly discovered coronavirus emerged and resulted in the formidable COVID-19 outbreak which 

evolved into a global pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we stay committed to prioritise the safety of our 

employees and students. We have implemented the safety protocols and educated our employees on the necessary 

measures to ensure that they are well-prepared in keeping themselves and our students safe.

This Report outlines MindChamps’ position on integrating sustainability into our strategies and operations and 

provides an overview of our policies and practices and sustainability initiatives and performance during FY2020.

SUSTAINABILITY AT MINDCHAMPS

MindChamps believes that, as a leader in Singapore’s education sector, we should inculcate the right values 

in our students (our “Champs”) and empower them through our curriculum and teaching pedagogy. This 

is a critical consideration for MindChamps as we continue to strengthen our business through responsible 

conduct of all our operations.

We address our material factors across three sustainability pillars, namely Environment, Social and Governance. 

Due to the nature of our business, our approach is focussed on people – who are fundamental to the long-term 

success of MindChamps. 

In FY2020, MindChamps accomplished several key milestones and set targets for the coming year to drive 

continuous improvement in the relevant areas.

ENVIRONMENT

Working Towards A 

Sustainable Future



SUSTAINABILITY CURRICULUM 

Anchored by MindChamps’ philosophy of filling the gaps in education systems worldwide, the objective 

of MindChamps’ education model is to prepare the children of today with the skills, flexibility and mindset 

to thrive in a rapidly-changing and information-saturated future, and nurturing every child to be the best 

they can be.

Sustainability is a key global issue in today’s context. Recognising this, MindChamps imparts this 

responsibility in our Champs. MindChamps educates our Champs to interact responsibly with the 

environment through our curriculum, which includes lesson design, class activities, excursions and year-

end concerts, as well as art exhibitions. MindChamps believes that nurturing and instilling a sense of 

responsibility should begin from our Champs’ early childhood.

MINDCHAMPS’ APPROACH

OBJECTIVE

MindChamps is committed to nurturing our  

Champs through a holistic curriculum in a  

vibrant environment.

MindChamps’ curriculum nurtures our Champs  

in all aspects of development, preparing them for  

the future from their early learning years.



Our Champs learn to care  

for the environment.

The MindChamps “Enquiry Approach to Teaching 

and Learning” has a strong focus on environmental 

awareness and sustainability. Three out of the four 

Enquiry themes for each level in MindChamps 

PreSchool are focussed on “Animals”, “Growing Things” 

and “Our World”. Through these Enquiry themes, our 

Champs explore and discover the world around them 

and learn about the importance of protecting the 

earth through environmentally-friendly practices, 

such as recycling, responsible consumption and 

practical energy-saving methods. Champs also learn 

about empowerment – the role each individual plays 

in protecting the environment. 

During a class activity, our Champs in Australia learned 

the craft of making their own recycled papers. This 

activity taught our Champs one of the many simple 

methods that they can use to help to save and protect 

the environment in their own way. They apply what 

they learn in school and bring the knowledge home to 

share with their family and friends. Moreover, many of 

our MindChamps Learning Zone resources are made 

from sustainable materials and also provide inspiration 

to Champs to use the resources to engage in activities 

to do with conservation and environmental awareness. 





Our Champs learn to care  

for the environment.

The learning about sustainability and environmental 

protection culminates in year-end concerts for all 

our MindChamps PreSchool centres. Our Champs’ 

performances are based on a common theme – saving 

the Earth and promoting the ideals of environmental 

protection. Despite it being a COVID-19 year with 

several precautionary measures in place, our centres 

put up centre based showcases that demonstrated 

their deep understanding of Our World and how we 

all have a role to play in protecting our environment.  

During the centre based K2 graduation ceremonies, 

many centres put up small concert items that 

demonstrated 

the 

Champs’ 

understanding 

of 

environmental protection through song and skit. This 

was aligned to that Term’s theme of Our World.

Also during the year end Art Exhibition, most of the 

exhibits were made from recycled materials and the 

works based on the theme of Our World.





Our Champs’ set up beautiful art galleries 

using the theme of Our World.

SUSTAINABILITY 

PRACTICES

MindChamps believes in leading by example to nurture 

and encourage behavioural changes that positively 

impact the environment. MindChamps teachers and 

employees practice the 3Rs – Reduce, Reuse and 

Recycle – in their daily activities at MindChamps 

PreSchool. 

Our teachers encourage our Champs to collect 

used materials such as bottles, aluminium cans and 

newspapers to decorate the classrooms as well as for 

their arts and crafts projects. This initiative exposes 

our Champs to sustainable practices, sparks their 

learning interest and inculcates recycling habits in 

them from their early learning years.

Our Champs created some pots with 

used plastic bottles.



Our Champs in Australia also practise the recycling 

of food waste. Before they wash their plates after 

each meal, they empty any food waste into a 

bucket. The food waste is then taken to a worm 

farm and recycled as food for the worms.

There are also conscious efforts by employees to 

reduce paper, water and electricity consumption in 

our corporate offices. Employees are encouraged 

and reminded to avoid printing documents where 

possible, and to switch off lights when they leave 

their offices

Note 1: This survey question was not covered in the Parents’ Survey for our Australian centres.

INTERACTION WITH STAKEHOLDERS

MindChamps recognises the importance of interacting with our stakeholders to build their understanding 

of MindChamps’ business. MindChamps regularly interacts and connects with our stakeholders through 

various engagement methods. These engagements aim to build and strengthen the trust in MindChamps’ 

brand and create long-term value for both MindChamps and our stakeholders.

This section describes MindChamps’ interactions with four key stakeholder groups; (1) customers, (2) media, 

(3) shareholders and analysts, and (4) employees, as they each have a major influence on MindChamps’ 

success, and are in turn, impacted by MindChamps.  

Customers

Understanding our customers is key to ensuring that MindChamps, and our Champs and their parents 

(“MindChamps parents”) develop a long-standing relationship. 

To deepen our understanding of MindChamps parents, we conduct surveys twice a year called the 

MindChamps PreSchool Parents’ Survey (“Parents’ Survey”) in Singapore and Australia. The Parents’ Survey 

aims to capture and understand the satisfaction level of MindChamps parents. The results drive continuous 

improvement in engaging with our customers. 

Based on the latest results of the Parents’ Survey, MindChamps achieved the following results:

To facilitate continuous interaction with our customers, we conduct Parent-Teacher Conferences (“PTCs”) 

and also implemented regular communications via the MindChamps Application (“MindChamps App”) 

and similar applications.

MINDCHAMPS’ APPROACH

OBJECTIVE

MindChamps’ growth and success are firmly  

anchored on education quality and sound people  

and stakeholder management. 

A dynamic business that responds proactively to the 

expectations of its stakeholders helps MindChamps  

to stay ahead in the preschool landscape.

PTCs are held at the end of every semester. The PTCs not only provide a platform for our teachers to 

update MindChamps parents on their Champs’ learning journeys, but also allow MindChamps parents 

to provide feedback on MindChamps’ curriculum and practices. This iterative, 360-degree platform 

facilitates effective and meaningful dialogue. 

The MindChamps App is a mobile application that was specially designed for MindChamps parents 

to participate in and celebrate their Champs’ growth and progress. Our teachers provide updates 

on our Champs’ educational development through the ‘My Learning Curriculum’ function on the 

MindChamps App. Furthermore, the MindChamps App enables MindChamps to continually strengthen 

the parent-centre partnership to nurture the best potential in all our Champs. It enables our teachers 

and MindChamps parents to foster two-way communication and easily exchange information about 

their Champs. Our teachers also recognise the importance of personal interaction and carry out good 

practices, such as greeting and meeting MindChamps parents every day when they come to the centres 

and sharing verbal updates regarding their Champs.

Media

The media plays an important role in communicating accurate information on MindChamps in their 

publications to a wider audience. The media also helps to widen exposure opportunities for MindChamps’ 

brands and products. 

In Singapore and Australia, MindChamps’ Corporate Communications team is responsible for overseeing both 

public relations and media relations for MindChamps, carries out media monitoring and engagement and issues 

media releases. The team works closely with the media to profile MindChamps’ Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), 

Executives and the World Research, Advisory and Education Team. The Corporate Communications team also 

works with the media to share the latest developments through print, broadcast and digital media outlets. 

MindChamps shares corporate announcements and news from our centres on social media platforms such as 

Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube and blogs.

Shareholders and Analysts

MindChamps is committed to providing shareholders with adequate, timely and sufficient information 

pertaining to changes in MindChamps’ business, guided by the SGX-ST Listing Manual, the Code of Corporate 

Governance and its Investor Relations Policy.

Announcements are disseminated to shareholders via SGXNet and uploaded on MindChamps’ corporate 

website. Shareholders may also subscribe to our email alerts for instant notification of such announcements. 

Shareholders may contact MindChamps’ Investor Relations team or our Lead Independent Director, through 

the channels set out on MindChamps’ corporate website.

MindChamps strongly encourages shareholders to 

participate in its general meetings. During MindChamps’ 

Annual General Meetings (“AGM”) for FY2020 which was 

conducted live electronically due to COVID-19 (Temporary 

Measures) (Alternative Arrangements for Meetings 

for Companies, Variable Capital Companies, Business 

Trusts, Unit Trusts and Debenture Holders) Order 2020, 

shareholders were provided with updates on business 

developments, insights into product enhancement 

initiatives, and an introduction to MindChamps’ pedagogy. 

The responses to the substantial and relevant questions 

received from shareholders were provided and uploaded 

onto the SGX’s website and Company’s website. The 

minutes of the AGM for FY2020 are published on the SGX’s 

website and Company’s website within one month from 

the AGM.

THE MINDCHAMPS AGM

The AGM is held annually 

 to engage with  

MindChamps’ shareholders. 

Shareholders are strongly 

encouraged to participate in the 

AGM to understand more about 

MindChamps’ business activities 

and financial performance. 

13


MindChamps regularly invites analysts to meetings after our half year and full year financial results announcements. 

At these meetings, our CEO and Chief Financial Officer share on MindChamps’ business performance from the 

results, which enables analysts to have a deeper understanding about MindChamps’ operating models and 

financial performance. This helps to create more public awareness about MindChamps’ business and presence, 

through the publications published by the analysts. Materials presented at these meetings are also made available 

on SGXNet and MindChamps’ corporate website.

Employees

Being a people-oriented business, our employees are critical to the success and growth of MindChamps’ business.  

Our initiatives relating to our employees are highlighted in the “Talent Attraction and Retention” section below.

TALENT ATTRACTION AND RETENTION

Attracting people who are passionate and share the MindChamps’ vision and values are crucial to maintain 

a healthy talent pipeline. Retaining employees who have been trained in the MindChamps curriculum and 

culture is of great importance to MindChamps’ sustainable growth. Hence, it is MindChamps’ aim to attract 

and retain these talents that would sustain the growth of the MindChamps business.

Attraction

To attract candidates who are in tune with our corporate culture and values, our recruitment strategy is 

to share with potential candidates the MindChamps story and business as well as our corporate culture 

and values at the pre-hiring stage. This is to get candidates excited about our corporate culture and 

values even before they are selected for interviews and to give candidates a better understanding of 

what MindChamps stand for, what we do, our passion and our unique culture and values. Candidates that 

are excited about our company and our unique culture and values would be keen to proceed on to the 

interview stage. Our aim is to increase the quality of recruitment by hiring candidates who have a better 

understanding of our company. 

Retention

MindChamps strives to create a welcoming and engaging culture as part of our talent retention strategy. In 

FY2020, amidst the pandemic and restrictions on physical gatherings, we have adopted online platforms to 

engage staff regularly via quarterly staff “Pow Wow” meetings. Team activities and meetings were regularly 

conducted online to keep employees engaged.

EMPLOYEE WELL-BEING DURING  

THE PANDEMIC

We appointed safe management champions to ensure safe management practices  

are adhered to and employees have a safe and hygienic environment to work in. 

We also supplied employee care packs with hand sanitisers and lozenges.

Remote working and flexible-working arrangements are in place during and after the  

circuit breaker phase to meet the goals of a safe workplace.

14




Sustainable Practices

To achieve paper reduction, MindChamps HR has embarked on an exercise to convert all employee personnel 

files to digital versions. 

A new Human Resource Information System was also implemented that enables employees to update 

personal information online, thereby reducing the usage of physical forms. 

Engagement and Culture

Through our enhanced annual performance appraisal system, MindChamps ensures that work performance 

requirements are met and our employees are given regular feedback on their performance and growth 

opportunities. MindChamps provides four days of Learning and Development leave annually for employees 

to attend courses that are relevant to their work. We also embrace continuous learning, upskilling and 

reskilling our employees through in-house teachers’ and leadership training, training programmes by the 

Early Childhood Development Agency as well as government supported Workforce Skills Qualifications 

(WSQ) programmes.

As a result of our talent engagement and workplace culture programmes, MindChamps received the HR Excellence 

Awards Singapore 2020 for Excellence in Workplace Culture (Silver) and the HR Asia Best Companies to Work for 

in Asia 2020 (Singapore Edition) awards. 

MindChamps has been recognised by 

HR Asia as one of the Best Companies to 

Work for in Asia. This award is given to 

world class corporations with high levels 

of employee engagement and excellent 

workplace cultures.

QUALITY OF EDUCATION SYSTEM4

MindChamps’ 3-Mind education model prepares the children of today with the skills, flexibility and mindset 

to thrive in a rapidly-changing and information-saturated future. The model strives to nurture every child 

to be the best that they can be, by focussing on the skills and strategies of learning. The model emphasises 

the teaching of the ‘how’ rather than the ‘what’ to learn. The 3-Mind approach was conceived alongside 

international experts, to nurture the 3-Minds (Champion, Learning and Creative Mind), MindChamps draws 

from the research of world-renowned neuroscientist, Professor Emeritus Allan Snyder FRS as well as the work 

of other experts from the domains of Education, Psychology, Neuroscience and Theatre.

THE 3-MIND EDUCATION MODEL 

MindChamps delivers, through “S.M.I.L.E.S”, a methodology of engagement, security, nurturing and 

exploration. This prepares the brain for optimal growth and anticipates the future development of the 3 

Minds. The acronym S.M.I.L.E.S. stands for: Sensory, Motor (Music and Movement), Intellectual, Linguistic, 

Emotional and Social. The S.M.I.L.E.S. methodology acknowledges that brains, in their formative stages, need 

all aspects of mind-stimulation simultaneously, and that all types of activities have the potential to engage 

all of the S.M.I.L.E.S. elements.

4 Quality of Education System includes education innovation and technology.

16






MindChamps teachers develop weekly Enquiry Teaching and Learning lesson cycles that best exemplify 

our philosophy of the 3 Minds and S.M.I.L.E.S. The Enquiry approach begins with active provocation by the 

teachers to stimulate our Champs’ interests and curiosity that sets them on active learning journeys. The 

various provocation methods applied range from books, images, games, to living things such as plants to 

appeal to the different learning styles of our Champs. This is aligned with the S.M.I.L.E.S methodology.  

The Champion Mind

The Champion Mind is actively nurtured through the 10 values of a MindChampion, and our teachers 

elaborate on these values through purposeful and incidental teachable moments. Through Enquiry, our 

Champs learn about discovering their own voice, personal creativity and self-expression – all these elements 

are reflective of the Champion Mind.  

The Learning Mind

Through provocation and discovery, the Learning 

Mind is tapped and nurtured. Our Champs embark 

on learning through Crafted Play that uses all forms 

of manipulatives, games and other creative learning 

resources. Crafted Play allows our Champs to have 

a ‘hands-on’ approach to learning and discovery. 

Furthermore, MindChamps teachers observe and 

document the interests of our Champs and design 

lessons which allow our Champs to further pursue 

their interests.

17


The Creative Mind

The Creative Mind is developed through various 

platforms. A key platform is the documenting of our 

Champs’  learning in the Enquiry Approach to Teaching 

and Learning. The Creative Mind is about nurturing 

self-expression, unique viewpoints and the mindset 

of listening and accepting the viewpoints of others. 

MindChamps teachers adopt various lesson strategies 

to encourage our Champs to demonstrate their 

learning through unique pieces of work as opposed 

to cookie-cutter works. Champs are encouraged to 

reflect on their works and articulate these reflections 

– to encourage their own voice.

 

PreSchool Environment

At MindChamps PreSchool centres, each class is 

managed by one English language teacher and one 

Chinese language teacher, who jointly educate our 

Champs through the daily curriculum. This provides 

our Champs with the learning opportunity to be 

effectively bilingual and nurture their interest in 

both languages from young. 

To further facilitate a conducive learning environment 

and have a greater alignment to the 3-Mind Education 

Model, all MindChamps PreSchool classrooms 

are designed with six Learning Zones: Dramatic, 

Construction, Art and Craft, Reading, Writing and 

Numeracy. These Learning Zones are designed with 

the objective of promoting imagination and learning. 

MindChamps HQ provides a yearly Enquiry Theme 

Guide to all MindChamps PreSchool centres. A set of 

16 Curriculum Folders, which provide comprehensive 

details of MindChamps’ curriculum and pedagogy 

as well as how the classroom space should be set 

up, is also communicated to and rolled out at all 

MindChamps PreSchool centres. These folders include 

lesson planning templates for integrated activities to 

drive the Enquiry Approach to Teaching and Learning.

MindChamps’ curriculum is the result of over 

a decade of research and development in the 

domains of Education, Psychology, Neuroscience 

and Theatre. Our curriculum nurtures all aspects 

of our Champs and includes world proprietary 

academic and enrichment programmes.

QUALITY OF TEACHERS 

MINDCHAMPS’ CURRICULUM

To deliver MindChamps’ curriculum, it is crucial that our teachers develop the right mindsets, values and skills 

and are equipped with the right tools.

MindChamps teachers are required to attend training to enhance their skills in areas such as coaching, tools for 

engagement, positive guidance as well as MindChamps’ curriculum within three months of onboarding. 

Our teachers are accredited by MindChamps HQ as part of training and must demonstrate learned skills and 

knowledge through practical exercises. 

MindChamps’ teacher training includes:

• Three overarching areas

- MindChamps Way Culture and Pedagogy

- Specialisation (Core)

- Enrichment

• Teacher Development and Training (“TDT”) Days

• Ad-hoc training by MindChamps HQ

Annually, all our teachers are also required to undergo two full days of TDT organised by MindChamps HQ 

and one full day of TDT organised by the centres. The TDTs provide a platform to share the best pedagogical 

practices and to reflect on MindChamps’ culture and values, and include training from our CEO and World

Due to COVID-19, our March 2020 TDT was converted to a centre based internal training and staff 

bonding day. This was also to allow for centres to respond adequately to the increasing COVID-19 

precautionary measures being put in place.

During the MindChamps TDT day in September 2020, we leverage on technology and connect our global 

community of MindChamps educators from Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines and Myanmar. We came 

together on the Zoom platform to celebrate the unique CRAFT of teaching, the MindChamps way. Our Founder 

CEO, David Chiem set the tone for the session, focusing on the craft of the teacher and Champion Mindset that 

comes with teaching. We then had 3 very special members from our World Research, Advisory and Education 

Team – Dr Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, Louise Mulligan-Andrews and Steven Andrews address our teachers. Dr Kathy 

Hirsh-Pasek shared her research on literacy and brain development while Louise Mulligan-Andrews and Steven 

Andrews drew on their experience in education to speak on the power of creating a curious classroom for our 

Champs. 

Apart from that the above, all MindChamps PreSchool principals and Centre Directors attend monthly meeting 

to keep up-to-date with the latest curriculum, policies and training requirements. Once again leveraging 

technology, we also held multiple online training sessions to raise the craft of teaching within our global 

community. Some of the pedagogical tools we covered included – the art of puppetry, digital story telling and 

teacher dress-up for an engaging environment. 

Based on our latest Parents’ Survey, 98% and 97% of MindChamps parents in Singapore and Australia rated 

our teachers and educators as ‘Excellent’ or ‘Good’. These high ratings are an affirmation of the quality of 

MindChamps teachers.

HEALTH AND SAFETY

5

MindChamps is responsible for the safety and well-being of thousands of young children and is also mindful 

of the need to create a safe workplace for our employees. 

MindChamps undertakes robust measures to ensure the safety of our Champs and employees. In addition 

to complying with the local laws and regulations, various policies have been established by MindChamps to 

address both Occupational Health and Safety and Preschool Health and Safety. 

At MindChamps, the work health and safety of all our stakeholders are of utmost importance. 

MindChamps is committed to conducting its business in a manner that promotes the work health 

and safety of its employees, contractors, visitors and clients. In the event of a work-related injury, 

MindChamps is also committed to ensuring that all injured workers have the opportunity to recover 

and return to work in a safe and timely manner.

MindChamps HQ has established a health and safety committee in compliance with the relevant laws 

and regulations, and maintains a WSH Policy as guidance in creating a safe environment for our Champs 

and employees. An SOP on Incident Management and Reporting has been established to ensure 

prompt reporting and investigation of incidents concerning safety. Regular checks are conducted at 

MindChamps HQ and PreSchool centres to identify any areas of potential safety risk. Operational risks 

are also reviewed in an effort to reduce and eliminate risks, where possible. Maintenance is scheduled 

regularly for properties such as elevators, escalators and stairwells, and hazards identified (if any) 

which cannot be eliminated are well signposted. Briefings are also conducted for all centre leaders in 

Singapore about workplace health and safety in accordance with the Work Injury Compensation Act.

MindChamps launched a Return to Work programme to promote the importance of safety and well-being of 

all our employees in Australia, through the development of a health and well-being strategy. The objective 

of the programme is to outline MindChamps’ commitment and approach to the management of the return 

to work of employees who have suffered workplace injury. 

All MindChamps teachers attend child first aid courses and are certified first aiders. They are trained to observe 

and identify medical conditions in our Champs and to take the necessary actions such as providing first aid and 

contacting the relevant emergency response teams. It is critical to ensure that our Champs receive the appropriate 

attention during an emergency. In addition, each centre has a safety team comprising teachers and admin staff 

who are assigned to ensure that health and safety measures are upheld at the centre, which include periodic 

checks on the expiry dates and the stock up of first aid kits and fire extinguishers. Each centre also has a fire 

warden to lead fire-drill exercises and safe evacuations in the event of an actual fire outbreak. 

Health and safety trainings are provided to both our Champs and employees to educate them on the 

potential health risks and safety hazards at MindChamps HQ and PreSchool centres, and the proper 

precautions to take. Additionally, fire evacuation drills are conducted for our Champs and employees 

at least once every six months to increase their awareness and preparedness in case of an emergency. 

Addressing the threat from COVID-19

Our employees are our valued assets and are key resources to the long-term viability of our business. 

We greatly value the diversity in our workforce and ensure that our employees’ well-being is well taken 

care of. 

In response to the threat from COVID-19, MindChamps stays committed to prioritise the safety of our 

employees and also our Champs. MindChamps has implemented various precautionary measures with 

reference to the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and other relevant authorities to address 

the safety and well-being of our employees and Champs.

Furthermore, MindChamps PreSchools are regularly 

audited for health and safety to ensure compliance 

with licensing requirements. To ensure the safety 

of our Champs, audits are conducted through the 

MindChamps ChampionGold Standard framework. 

The MindChamps safety manager conducts bi-

annual spot checks, carries out timely investigation 

and implements preventive and corrective actions 

when incidents are reported. Preschool equipment 

such as toys and playgrounds are cleaned daily and 

maintained and upgraded annually. Our centres 

also ensure that our Champs of different age groups 

are provided with age-appropriate toys. 

MindChamps takes pride in providing a safe learning 

environment for our Champs. For example, one of 

the key safety features that MindChamps upholds 

strictly is the installation of door guards in all our 

centres. This minimises the risk of doors accidently 

closing on our Champs’ fingers. 

WALKING FEET  

CAMPAIGN 

Our Champs are reminded to use 

their ‘walking feet’ when moving 

about in MindChamps PreSchool 

centres and not to run within the 

premises. MindChamps instils safe 

behaviours in our Champs and 

encourages them to be responsible 

for their own safety as well as the 

safety of their peers and teachers  

through positive guidance  

and fun activities. 

23




We established the safety measures and emergency 

response protocols that communicated among our 

employees to ensure our operations are conducted  

in a safe manner and keeping our employees and  

Champs safe. The safety measures included the 

following:

• Temperature of all our employees at workplace  

   were taken twice each day and they are advised to  

  consult the doctors and stay at home if they are 

   feeling unwell.

•  Implemented SafeEntry digital check-in system in  

  the workplace and classrooms to collect entry  

  data of employees, Champs and visitors for 

    contact tracing purposes. 

• All 

visitors 

are 

required 

to 

record 

their 

  temperature and contact details before entering 

   our premises, to ease the contact tracing process. 

• Ensure one-meter safe distancing among our 

  employees and Champs in the workplace and 

    classrooms. 

• Encourage virtual meetings and minimise the 

   physical meetings at workplacce. 

•  Promote staggered working hours and break time. 

• Timely 

update 

on 

general 

information 

on 

    prevention spread of COVID-19 virus. 

• Face masks and hand sanitisers were made  

    available for all employees and Champs, they were  

  reminded to wear face masks at all times and to 

   apply hand sanitisers regularly. 

• Disinfection of common touchpoints within our 

   premises daily 

At our preschool centres, good hygiene measures 

continue to be practised. Our teachers and Champs 

take temperature thrice a day. The centres are 

cleaned daily and more frequently throughout the 

day. Unless necessary, all visitors are not allowed to 

enter the preschool centres. Visitors are required to 

record their temperature, provide contact details 

and complete a declaration form before entering 

the preschool centres. MindChamps also ensures 

that it complies with the local regulations.







Our Champs sanitise and wash 

their hands thoroughly.

Our Champs learnt about 

COVID-19 and how they can play a 

part in practising good hygiene.

Safe distancing measures  

were practised prior to the  

Circuit Breaker period.

LOCAL COMMUNITIES

MindChamps is committed to investing in local 

communities to drive positive change and to support 

communities in need. FY2020 proved to be a challenging 

year with COVID-19 restrictions curtailing various 

community involvement and charity plans of our various 

centres. However, at MindChamps, we embrace Setbacks 

as Setups and many of our centres found innovative 

ways to give back to the community while inculcating 

values of compassion, kindness and generosity in all 

our Champs.

Another example of turning Setbacks into Setups was 

how our centres in Australia and Singapore remained 

committed to using the COVID-19 pandemic as a teaching 

resource to nurture compassion and community spirit in 

our Champs. Educators and teachers seized the moment 

to craft enquiry based teaching where Champs explored 

the work of frontline and essential workers during this 

challenging time. Champs wrote notes of gratitude and 

encouragement and sent them over to the frontline 

and essential workers in their community. For example, 

we see Champs here sending notes of appreciation to 

frontline workers at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Tan Tock 

Seng Hospital, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Q&amp;M 

Medical Centre.

26


For FY2020, our centres continued to demonstrate examples of 

strong outreach to the local communities. In January 2020, the 

Champs and staff at MindChamps PreSchool @ The Brooks II carried 

out a visit to aged home at the Sree Narayana Mission in Singapore. 

During the visit, they engaged and entertained the aged and learnt 

more about the services in this Mission.

In Australia, our centres were also engaged in community work in 

early 2020 during the period of serious bushfire outbreaks. During 

this time, Champs learnt about how bushfires affected communities 

around them and carried out various outreach activities.  

Overall, the community spirit, outreach and teaching of 

MindChamps attributes remained at the forefront of our 

programming despite the COVID-19 measures. Champs learnt 

about the pandemic, the contributions of the frontline workers and 

even developed a stronger appreciation of their families (especially 

during the time of home based learning).

Globally, as families grappled with home learning as part of 

COVID-19 precautionary measures, MindChamps responded 

with a wealth of online resources to support families. We 

extended our Home Based Learning resources as well as our 

Champion Mindset Parenting Strategies to families in Singapore 

and Australia at no cost.

In Australia, MindChamps continued to be of service to the 

community by extending over 500 hours of free childcare to 

children who had been turned away by their childcare services due 

to reduction in staffing.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

Good corporate governance is essential to operate in the regulated preschool sector as it safeguards 

MindChamps from risk and reputational damage. It is also key to building customer confidence, loyalty 

and trust. 

In view of the various regulations that govern preschools, MindChamps institutes policies to guide its 

operations. MindChamps also regularly reviews these policies to ensure that they are kept up to date. 

In addition to having policies as overarching governance, MindChamps PreSchool centre leaders conduct 

self-assessment in compliance with the Early Childhood Development Agency’s (“ECDA”) licensing 

requirements. A compliance audit is carried out by MindChamps HQ one month prior to the ECDA licensing 

officer’s renewal assessment visit. Meetings are regularly held with business leaders to communicate and 

align ECDA’s licensing requirements and Code of Practice with centre operations and practices.

For Australia, all MindChamps Early Learning Centres use the MindChamps policies and protocols as well as 

the ChampionGold Standards to meet the standards spelt out the National Quality Framework. Our centres 

are regulated, assessed and rated under this framework. Our centres also conduct self-assessment and 

make the necessary improvements which are reflected in the Quality Improvement Plan of each centre, on 

an annual basis. 

MindChamps also takes a serious stance on ensuring that our franchisees comply with regulations and 

uphold our values, so that our brand and curriculum are not compromised. MindChamps has in place a 

robust compliance audit framework for our franchisees. An annual compliance audit is carried out on every 

franchisee by an independent service provider. Through the audit process, issues are identified and follow 

up actions are reported to MindChamps HQ and the franchisee. Our teams work closely with franchisees 

to resolve any issues identified and constantly improve on operations. Due to the framework in place and 

annual checks on our franchisees, no significant issues were reported in FY2020.

 

MindChamps endeavours to continue to operate to the highest standards in compliance with the relevant 

laws and regulations.
