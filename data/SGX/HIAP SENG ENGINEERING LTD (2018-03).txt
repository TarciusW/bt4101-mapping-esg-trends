Hiap Seng Engineering Limited Sustainability Report 2018 





We are pleased to issue our first dedicated Sustainability Report.  

The Group recognizes that embracing sustainable practices is a business priority that is 

important for the long-term development and success of our business. As such, assessing 

and improving our impact and operational sustainability has been integrated as part of the 

Group’s strategic formulation.  

Central to progressing in our sustainability journey is the determination of the material 

topics through which the Group will measure and report its sustainability performance. 

Together with Management, the Board have identified eight material topics to be included 

in this year’s Sustainability Report.  

Energy, water and waste management were chosen as the fundamental environmental 

factors for the Group. Social and governance factors central to our operations and products 

were determined to be our investment in human capital and occupational health and 

safety, as well as oversight of product quality, ethical conduct and regulatory compliance. 

The Board has been integral in determining these topics and will play a key role in the 

oversight of their future management.

To illustrate the degree of our impacts and the importance to stakeholders, the material 

aspects have been plotted on a materiality matrix. The figure below highlights our list of 

identified material topics. 

 

 

 

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE 

Management of sustainability issues flows right through the organisation and engages all 

employees in some way. Our business departments collectively contribute to ensure the 

implementation of our sustainability policies, report and steward performance as set by 

the Sustainability Council. The Council then reports directly to the CEO, and subsequently 

to the Company’s Board of Directors on matters pertaining to sustainability, acting in 

accordance with the Board of Directors’ strategic priorities. 

The sustainability council will provide resources required by the ESG panels to achieve set 

targets, and facilitate two-way communication by conducting regular meetings that allows

ESG panels. In this manner, we aim to ensure practicing of initiatives that are highly 

relevant to our material topics. 

 

 

 

One way we address and mitigate our sustainability risks is through our Integrated 

Management System (IMS), which we developed and put in place to fulfill our ISO 

9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and OHSAS 18001:2007 requirements. The IMS helps us 

ensure compliance across the three ESG pillars and is part of our sustainability strategy.

Hiap Seng Engineering Limited Sustainability Report 2018 







 

We are committed to reducing our environmental footprint by minimising our energy 

and water consumption and managing waste from our operations in a responsible 

manner. We see this as an opportunity to stay ahead of the curve in a resource 

constrained economy faced with the challenge of climate change. 

 

ENERGY CONSUMPTION 

Why material 

Our industry is energy intensive with our production sites, offices and warehouses being 

the key sources of energy consumption. Some of the processes that we use in our 

operations, such as welding, can use a lot of energy. Lowering our consumption can help 

reduce our operational costs and align our efforts towards global and national efforts to 

curb emissions and climate change. 

Management approach 

We are an ISO 14001:2015 certified organisation and our adherence to this standard 

highlights our precautionary approach to environmental risks. Our energy management 

efforts are guided by our environmental policy, which requires us to control environmental 

risks, develop environmental programs, promote best practices and develop awareness in 

managers, supervisors and workers.  

 

In FY 2018, we carried out a few initiatives to reduce our energy consumption. Our office 

communication programme was used to build awareness on energy savings across our 

employees. We continually replace obsolete equipment and base the procurement of new 

equipment keeping in mind their energy efficiency considerations; for example welding 

power sources and LED lighting. In FY 2018, we undertook the following replacements: 

• 

Replacement of electrical equipment with energy efficient equipment 

1. Replacement of end-of-life lightings 

• 

Replacements done with higher efficacy lighting than incandescent lights 

(e.g. T8 fluorescent tubes in offices, HID bulbs and LED light in workshops) 

• 

Evaluating suitability of usage of higher efficiency lighting solutions for 

replacement in workshop and offices underway, while keeping abreast on 

updated lighting technology 

2. Replacement of end-of-life air-conditioning units with energy efficient options 

• 

minimum of 2 ticks (if covered under MELS) 

• 

advanced VRV system (not covered under MELS) 

 

Performance 

While we have taken a number of steps to reduce our energy consumption, we can often 

be constrained by the projects we undertake during the year and the total consumption 

can be work-load reliant. Our performance for FY 2018 is highlighted in the chart below, 

showing our electricity1 and diesel2 consumption. 

 

 

 

1 The data is compiled based on utility bills and the conversion factor used: 1 kWh = 0.0036 GJ

Targets 

We aim to reduce 5% of office electricity consumption by FY 2019.  

 

WATER CONSUMPTION 

Why material 

Water security is a rising global concern and of particular relevance to Singapore. Acute 

water shortages, which are already visible across large parts of Asia and globally, have 

started disrupting industrial operations. At Hiap Seng, we rely on water usage primarily 

for the hydro and load testing processes in projects, and for office use. We are conscious 

of the risks relating to water, and recognise the economic, social and environmental 

benefits from a strategic approach to water management.  

 

Management approach 

We strive to use alternate water sources, such as seawater, for testing processes whenever 

feasible to minimize consumption of utility water. 

Furthermore, our environmental policy encourages the use of water savings equipment 

and processes across Hiap Seng’s operations. Employees are sensitised on issues relating 

to water scarcity and advised to actively reduce water consumption.

WASTE MANAGEMENT 

Why material 

Raw materials that go into our products, such as metal, are getting scarcer and more 

expensive. We recognise that in order to remain competitive, we will need to embrace 

concepts of a circular economy by increasing our efforts to reduce, recycle and reuse and 

thereby minimising our dependence on virgin materials. 

Management approach 

Our environmental policy guides our waste reduction and management processes including 

training to employees. In order to reduce waste, we have been working towards optimising 

our procurement process and avoiding purchase of any excess raw materials.  

Given that some of our waste is hazardous, we take disposal very seriously by ensuring 

that the waste is fit for release before disposal. 

Performance 

 

Targets 

For FY 2019, we are aiming to develop an environmental educational program concerning 

proper e-waste management on and to continue ensuring zero release of contaminating 

fluids or toxic waste.

HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

Why material 

Attracting and retaining the right talent is becoming challenging in our industry. High 

turnover rates can affect the bottom line through higher training costs. Furthermore, given 

that foreign workers represent a significant portion of our workforce, we need to ensure 

that they are managed and treated fairly, equally and in compliance with local regulations.   

 

Management approach 

We address this material area through a few key considerations: (i) fair labour practices; 

(ii) talent attraction; (iii) training and development and; (iv) benefits and well-being.  

 

Fair labour practice 

Our human capital practices in Singapore are aligned with the ‘Tripartite Alliance for Fair 

and Progressive Employment Practices’ that promote fair and equitable employment 

practices. 

 

We recruit foreign workers through reputable agencies based on project requirement and 

closely ensure compliance to legal regulations (e.g. Employment of Foreign Manpower 

Act). The well-being of our foreign workers is important to us. For the workers we ensure 

they are housed in adequate dormitory facilities, provide them 3 meals a day, and arrange 

for additional amenities such as air-conditioned transport. 

 

Talent attraction 

We want to employ future leaders and attracting the right talent is key to our long-term 

success. Currently we rely on public recruitment channels and through referrals. We 

continue to explore internship programmes with reputable universities with the aim to 

offer positions to outstanding performers. 

 

 

 

 

3 Currently, Hiap Seng is not part of, nor have any relationship with any unions. Hiap Seng does not take part 

in collective bargaining agreements. 


 

 

15 

Hiap Seng Engineering Limited Sustainability Report 2018 

Training and development 

Our workers go through all mandatory trainings and 

at times specialised trainings required by our 

customers. 

Foreign 

workers 

attend 

skills 

enhancement trainings. 

 

We encourage and offer grants to our managers and 

supervisors to enroll for optional training programs 

to update skills and knowledge in areas of their 

work. To enhance cross-skill learning, we also offer 

opportunities for staff to enroll in programs that are 

not directly in their line of work. For example, in FY 

2018, our employees attended finance for non-

finance professionals.  

 

Well-being and benefits 

Incentives and benefits are another medium to drive employee satisfaction and boost their 

morale. We reimburse payments on medical, dental, corporate travel, hospital and surgical 

insurances. In addition, we support our employees during periods of joy and grief through 

our marriage and compassionate leave arrangements. We like to celebrate the success of 

the organisation with our employees. Project completion celebrations, company 

anniversary lunches, annual dinner and dances and festival celebrations are some of the 

ways we express our gratitude towards our people.

Bank to talk about the topic of 

trade finance. The talk was not 

just restricted to finance and 

accounts but involved employees 

across various departments such 

as business development and 

procurement. The talk was well 

received by all attendees.

Targets 

Going forward in FY 2019, we plan to implement at least one initiative that can improve 

the workplace environment by making it an easier, safer or smarter workplace for our 

employees.  

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

Why material 

The engineering and construction industry is vulnerable to the risk of occupational health 

and safety. Our employees work in conditions that pose accident risks and we see their 

protection as our prime duty. 

 

Management approach 

We are OHSAS 18001:2007 certified and accredited with bizSAFE Star and bizSAFE Partner 

status by the Workplace Safety and Health Council Singapore (WHSC), a testament to our 

commitment to implement the highest standards of workplace safety.  

 

A portion of our manual labour is carried out by contractor’s workers. We are careful about 

our selection of contractors and are responsible for the safety and protection of the 

contractors’ workers on our sites. 

Occupational health and safety is a key focus area of focus for us and one we monitor 

closely through our Integrated Management System (IMS). Our Health and Safety and 

Drug and Alcohol policies guide our employees in maintaining a safe work environment. 

All employees must go through training on these policies and supporting documentation, 

which detail out 32 procedures such as protective equipment, working at heights, night 

work safety and electrical safety among others. 

Our risk management starts from the risk assessment stage. Our activities, products and 

services are assessed for their relevant hazards that may pose risk to employees, visitors 

and contractors. In view of the past incidents and the current control methods these 

hazards are evaluated in terms of their severity and likelihood of happening, determining 

the risk level. Identified activities and hazards are recorded in a risk assessment form. 

Operations and activities that are associated with the identified risk are considered in 

setting the risk control action plan including the objectives and targets. Any changes in 

the activities and facilities are evaluated and control measures are updated accordingly. 

An annual review of the risk assessment form is performed. 

 

 

6 A larger proportion of senior management and managers are male employees that have been with the company 

for a long period, and therefore compensated in accordance to their contribution and experience. The company 

continues to practice gender equality, and offer equal growth opportunities to female employees. 

7 The skew toward female staff remuneration in this category highlights the fact that many of administration staff 

are female employees who have been with us a very long time and are therefore compensated and valued for 

their growth and their commitment to our company.  


 

 

18 

Hiap Seng Engineering Limited Sustainability Report 2018 

We strongly inculcate safety behaviors at grassroots level. For example, safety 

coordinators conduct daily toolbox talks to share any incident and discuss any high risk 

activities that may be coming up. We also have an emergency response procedure for fires 

and chemical hazards. Fire drills are conducted twice a year internally. 

Performance 

Despite our efforts, over the year our employees and worker/contractors incurred 11 

recordable injuries including minor cuts, fractures and foreign objects in eye. Our 

recordable injury rate was 0.688. We had zero high consequence injuries or fatalities. 

 

Targets 

In FY 2019, we strive to reduce our near miss and first aid cases by 20%. 

 

 

8 Our injury rate is calculated based on 200,000 hours. Currently we do not segregate injuries by male and 

female or by employees and workers/contractors. We will strive to do this in future.

Hiap Seng Engineering Limited Sustainability Report 2018 





 

In today’s challenging times, it is crucial for organisations to manage issues 

pertaining to governance. Delivering superior quality while maintaining high 

standards of regulatory compliance and oversight over the supply chain is key to be 

a distinguished player in the market   

 

PRODUCT QUALITY AND SAFETY 

Why material 

Product quality and safety issues are particularly important in engineering and construction 

related projects for the sectors where we operate. We serve large multi-national clients 

and have spent years building the relationships that make us a vendor of choice. Exceeding 

on quality has been fundamental in bringing us to where we are. Any lapses can result in 

significant damage to our reputation and customer base. 

 

Management approach 

We strive to maintain high product and service quality and are guided by the ISO 

9001:2015 quality management system.  

 

Our quality policy, which forms part of our IMS helps establish the processes to implement 

this system effectively. The policy provides guidance on the various attributes that 

contribute to quality including design, procurement, fabrication, inspection, testing and 

feedback.  This policy is defined and reviewed by top management to ensure that it reflects 

the nature and scale of products and services quality. The policy is communicated to all 

employees through IMS briefings, formal and informal meetings and training, including 

on-the-job training for new staff. It is the responsibility of all employees, subcontractors 

and suppliers to support the implementation of the policy. 

 

Performance 

We are proud to say that there were no cases of non-compliance 

concerning the health and safety impacts of our products and services 

in FY 2018.  

Targets 

Our target is to continue to incorporate quality and safety 

considerations in our projects in FY 2019, and maintain compliance. 

RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN 

Why material 

We have an extensive supply chain ranging from contractors, material and services 

providers, equipment and transport vendors. 

 

We recognise that engaging responsible suppliers can help in reducing our sustainability 

impacts and compliance risks. Our customers request greater transparency down their 

value chain and we can facilitate that through responsible procurement. Furthermore, 

procurement through local suppliers helps us grow the domestic economy and reduce our 

environment footprint. 

 

 

 






 

 

20 

Hiap Seng Engineering Limited Sustainability Report 2018 

Management approach 

All our suppliers are evaluated based on a set of criteria and their ability to meet our 

organisational requirements. In order to ensure rigour in supplier selection, our previously 

approved suppliers need to go through a re-evaluation cycle on frequent basis. On matters 

of health and safety, we only engage Bizsafe certified suppliers.  

 

Performance 

In FY 2018, 79% of procurement expenditure was from local suppliers.  

Targets 

We aim to continue only dealing with suppliers that have achieved a high rating based on 

our internal performance evaluations. We also aim to maintain a majority of procurement 

expenditure from local suppliers. 

 

In the future, we aim to expand our supplier assessment and implement additional 

considerations (e.g. environmental, social, productivity). 

 

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE 

Why material 

As a listed entity, we are subject to a number of regulatory compliance requirements 

pertaining to occupational health and safety, labour, environmental compliance, finance 

and markets. The various regulatory bodies that oversee our operations include the 

Ministry of Manpower, National Environment Agency and SGX among others. Adherence 

to these requirements defines our social, environmental and economic license to operate.  

 

Management approach 

Our IMS highlights all regulatory risks and lays out the roles, objectives and processes to 

ensure compliance. Our employees are given access to and training on the legal and other 

requirements to which we subscribe. Any changes to the requirements are highlighted and 

communicated on a regular basis.  

 

Performance 

Despite our efforts, there were two cases of non-compliance in the social and 

environmental areas that resulted in penalties. We received small fines from the National 

Environment Agency for mosquito breeding and from the Singapore Civil Defense Force 

(SCDF) for obstruction to fire door at our headquarters.  

 

In response, we are working closely with our pest control operator to increase vigilance 

on mosquito control efforts. We have also instated a fire safety manager to enhance our 

compliance to building fire safety regulations. 

 

Targets 

We have taken these lapses very seriously and will continue to verify and validate that 

controls remain effective to avoid similar incidents in FY 2019.
