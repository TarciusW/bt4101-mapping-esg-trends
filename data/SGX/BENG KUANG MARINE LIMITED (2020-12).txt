Dear Stakeholders, 

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) is pleased to present the annual Sustainability Report (the 

“Report”) of Beng Kuang Marine Limited (together with its subsidiaries, collectively the “Group”, “We”, 

“Our” or “Beng Kuang Group”). This Report is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting 

Initiative (“GRI”) guidelines on Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) topics, in relation to the 

Financial Year ended 31 December 2020 (“FY2020”). 

The Board has provided guidance and support to ensure that sustainable practices are embedded in 

our business operations while aligned with our Group’s business strategies. 

Our Group strongly believes that sustainability is a crucial factor to remain competitive in today’s 

market. Being socially responsible, we are determined to reduce our carbon footprint and preserve 

scarce natural resources through our sustainability efforts such as adopting energy and water saving 

techniques and instilling sustainability awareness in all our employees. Beng Kuang Group also 

emphasises on occupational  safety of our employees and aims to achieve zero case of work-related 

serious injuries or death during our daily operations.  

Amid the global COVID -19 pandemic, , our Group strictly follows the instructions given by our 

government and professional bodies to safeguard the well-being of all our employees. Safety 

measures such as enforcing social distancing, mask wearing and implementing Safe Entry were taken 

whilst continuing normal business operations. Global markets have been hit hard by COVID-19 since 

2020 and the market may take a while to recover from the adverse impact caused. We are expecting 

a significant decrease in our revenue in the short term due to both the pandemic and depressed 

marine, offshore oil and gas markets. However, we are confident that we will recover over time. 

 

Overall, the Group would like to take this opportunity to thank our stakeholders who have been 

supporting us through our journey to sustainable development.

Supply Chain Management 

 

Raw material suppliers, equipment manufacturers, water distributors and suppliers of marine and 

industrial hardware remain as the main suppliers of our Group. Regular and necessary screenings and 

assessments have been performed on our suppliers based on our procurement guidelines and policies. 

Factors such as industry track record and quality of goods and services delivered, were reviewed to 

ensure the compliance with local, health and safety rules and regulations.  

In 2020, our supply chains were significantly disrupted by COVID-19. Our suppliers were unable to 

meet the expected delivery dates, and we could not at times deliver our goods and services to 

customers in a timely manner. Nonetheless, with effective preventive measures against COVID-19 and 

vaccination programs rolling out in various nations such as Singapore and Indonesia, our supply chains 

are gradually recovering from the disruptions.

However, our engagements with stakeholders were affected due to the ongoing pandemic situation. 

Following are some of the examples: 

❖ Drastic reduction in physical meetings with our customers, shareholders and investors. 

❖ Foreign workers were confined to dormitory for about 6 months whilst Work-From-Home was 

enforced to the rest of our employees during the Circuit Breaker period. 

❖ Some disruptions to delivery of supplies due to Circuit Breaker measures enforced by the local 

government. 

Nonetheless, our Group will continue our efforts in incorporating all the appropriate and relevant 

feedbacks and suggestions from our valued stakeholders into our strategies and business operations.

Materiality Assessment 

 

We have identified an additional material topic for FY2020, Employment, through active engagement 

with our stakeholders and in view of the COVID-19. 

 

Meanwhile, the five previously identified topics i.e. anti-corruption, energy, water, effluent and waste 

as well as occupational health and safety remain relevant and material to our business operations.  

All the material topics are identified based on the significance of the topics against their influence on 

stakeholder’s assessment and decisions.

Corporate Governance 

 

Anti-corruption 

 

A high standard of corporate governance to ensure accountability and transparency in our business 

operations can be observed in the Group. Policies and procedures for Whistleblowing and Interested 

Person Transactions have been established and updated regularly to safeguard the Group from any 

potential frauds and to protect the interests of our stakeholders. We are pleased to announce that 

there were no reported corruption cases for another year. 

Our Group is determined to uphold our zero-tolerance stance for any form of corruption and any 

significant wrongdoing in business affairs. We encourage all our employees to report any breaches or 

raise any concerns directly to the Audit Committee Chairman. All reports will be handled in a 

confidential manner in order to protect the whistle blowers, independent investigations will be carried 

out and appropriate follow-up actions will be taken. However, for any false reporting, disciplinary 

actions will be taken. 

Meanwhile, interested person transactions are closely monitored by our Board in compliance with 

Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual of SGX-ST Mainboard Rules. In order to ensure interested person 

transactions were carried out at arm’s length basis and are not prejudicial to the interests of the 

Company and its minority shareholders, all interested person transactions were documented and 

submitted to the Audit Committee for review on a quarterly basis.  

For further details on Corporate Governance, kindly refer to pages 14 to 33 of our Annual Report.

Environment 

 

Our Group is dedicated to protecting the environment through the integration of environmental 

considerations into our business operations. Besides complying with local laws and regulations 

regarding the environment and adopting external initiatives such as “ Reduce, Reuse, Recycle” 

initiated by the National Environment Agency , we will continuously explore any new technologies 

available to help reduce our energy and water consumption as well as waste generated during our 

business operations. We also work with our customers, suppliers and employees in adopting more 

environmental responsible ways such as by starting to promote e-invoice and reduce packaging 

whenever possible.  

Energy 

 

Our diesel consumption decreased from 962,382 MJ in 2019 to 905,300 MJ in 2020. Meanwhile, our 

electricity consumption also decreased from 1,196,220 MJ in 2019 to 1,105,897 MJ in 2020. The 

decrease of 57,082 MJ or 6% for diesel consumption and 90,323 MJ or 8% for electricity consumption 

was contributed by the ongoing COVID-19 which resulted in significant disruptions in production and 

delivery of goods and services especially when some of our foreign workers were confined to their 

dormitories for 6 months.  

Our Group believes that through energy conservation, we will achieve both reduction in carbon 

footprint and improvement in our financial performance. Therefore, our Group will continue our 

journey in exploring new solutions for energy conservation while cultivating the habits of energy 

conservation in all our employees.

Water 

 

As a result of the 

pandemic, our water 

consumption 

also 

decreased 

from 

2,101 m3 in 2019 to 

1,813 m3 in 2020. 

The decrease was 

about 288 m3 or 14% 

in total as compared 

to the prior year. 

Water 

scarcity 

is 

always a concern to 

a country like Singapore. Sources of our potable water consumption include water from local 

catchment, imported water from Malaysia, treated water from sewage and desalinated water from 

sea. Being a socially responsible corporation, it is our duty to help our society and nation in water 

conservation through cultivating water saving habits in our employees while exploring new 

technologies in reduction of our water consumption further. 

Effluents and Waste 

 

Copper 

Slag 

is 

the 

main 

hazardous waste which will be 

generated during our business 

operations. A decrease of 77.5 

tons or 25% in copper slag 

generation can be observed in 

2020. This was mainly due to 

the significant disruption in our 

business operations during the 

COVID-19. 

Our 

Group 

has 

engaged 

National Environment Agency approved waste collectors for the collection and treatment of the 

copper slag generated from our business operations. Besides pricing, other factors such as reputation 

and social responsibility were also taken into our considerations when selecting a suitable waste 

collector, to ensure that the hazardous waste were collected and treated safely and correctly to 

prevent any damage to our society and environment.

Employment 

 

Due to the ongoing COVID-19, our employment was significantly affected and our financial 

performance for FY2020 was severely impacted as the result. Therefore, we have identified this as a 

material topic and included this in this report. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Due to the nature of our business and industry, majority of our workforce are male. However, our 

recruitment selection process mainly considers the aspects of talent, suitability, and work attitude 

rather than other aspects such as gender. All our employees were given mandatory benefits such as 

maternity and paternal leave. Additionally, employees at Assistant Manager level and above were 

covered under the Company’s General Hospitalisation and Surgical and Personal Accident Insurance. 

 

The table below shows the change in employees’ statistics for Financial Year 2019 and 2020.

From the graphs and table above, a decrease in our workforce can be observed in FY 2020.  The main 

reason to this decrease was the COVID-19. As the result of the pandemic, our foreign workers living in 

dormitories were confined for about 6 months while some of our employees were unable to return to 

Singapore due to border closure. We have also obtained grants from the Singapore government in the 

form of the Jobs Support Scheme. Nevertheless, as we believe that the pandemic is coming to an end, 

we are confident that our workforce will gradually recover with the resumption of our business 

operations.

Occupational Health and Safety (“OHS”) 

 

Policies and procedures for OHS were established 

and put in place to minimise the possibility of 

health and safety issues at our workplaces and 

offices. OHS targets were set at the beginning of 

each financial year. For FY2020, our group has met 

the Minor Injuries AFR and ASR targets with an AFR 

score of 1.19 and an ASR score of 3.57.  

However, we failed to achieve our targets for Major 

Injury AFR and ASR as our Group has ended 2020 

with AFR of 10.67 and ASR of 270.96 for Major 

Injury. This was due to 2 major accidents in January 

2020 which resulted in 2 workers having fractures. 

A total 132 of man-days were lost due to these 

accidents. Subsequent to the accidents, we have 

performed a root cause investigation and 

improvements to our safety program have been implemented. 

Our Group emphasises health and safety of our employees as one of our top priorities in business 

operations. We are determined to provide a safe and conducive working environment to our 

employees.  

As a showcase of our determination, we have been OHSAS 18001:2007 certified for our OHS 

Management System, which covers all our employees, business activities and workplaces. We are also 

Bizsafe Level 4 certified by the Workplace Safety and Health Council Singapore (WHSC), and in 

compliance with the Workplace Safety and Health (Risk Assessment) Regulation. Our Group also 

established a Safe Management Measure Plan in line with Ministry of Manpower and Economic 

Development Board recommendations to ensure the health and safety of all our employees during 

the Covid-19 pandemic. 

Annual health and safety hazards risk assessments were performed by our certified Safety Officer. 

Employees were also encouraged to report work-related hazards and hazardous situations and were 

allowed to remove themselves from hazardous work situations that they believe could cause injury or 

ill health without reprisals.  

OSH trainings and briefings regarding the below mentioned areas were also provided to our 

employees during FY2020: 

• 

Forklift operations 

• 

Working at heights 

• 

Hot works 

 

 



OHS Targets 

✓ Reduce the Major Injury Accident 

Frequency Rate (“AFR”) and Accident 

Severity Rate (“ASR”) to below 1.2 and 

100 per million-man hours worked 

✓ Reduce the Minor Injury AFR and ASR to 

below 6.5 and 50 per million-man hours 

worked. 

✓ Achieve Zero occupational diseases 

✓ Achieve Zero Noise Induced Deafness 

Case 

✓ Ensure 100% of at-risk staff to attend the 

Audiometric Examination 

 


 

 

Page 14 

 



For the upcoming 2021, we will maintain our OHS targets and continue to focus on health and safety 

awareness training to help our employees better understand their safety responsibilities. We will 

also reinforce the vital importance of safe work practices through safety trainings provided by the 

Group.
