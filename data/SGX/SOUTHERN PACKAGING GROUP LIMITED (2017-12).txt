During the year, we uphold the concept of customer first. Through operational 

resource integration and innovation, we are able to meet the needs of our 

customers and achieve our sales target. The Group’s sales revenue increased 

by 11% (RMB 72 million), from RMB 651 million in FY2016 to RMB 723 million 

in FY2017. Rigid packaging is our main growth point. As the new production 

base in East China has put into use, the Group has increased its production 

capacity and operational efficiency. The sales revenue of rigid packaging 

reached a record high of RMB 428 million in FY2017 (16% increase) compared 

to RMB 370 million in FY2016. The sales revenue of flexible packaging 

increased by 5% (RMB14 million), from RMB 281 million in FY2016 to RMB 295

Gross profit by business segments

Rigid Packaging 硬性包装

Flexible Packaging 软性包装



During the year, the Group’s gross profit 

decreased by 6.7% to RMB 162.7 million. 

The gross profit of rigid packaging 

increased by 6.4% to RMB 104.6 million. 

The gross profit of flexible packaging 

decreased by 23.6% to RMB 58.1 million. 

The gross profit decreased mainly due to the increase in purchase price of raw 

materials and labour costs. 

In FY 2018, our objective is to enhance our brand name and product quality, 

and optimise our cost-structure. We also strive to maximise the scale and 

efficiency of our production.

Energy  

We plan to upgrade our production 

facilities and equipment with the intention 

to enhance energy efficiency. At the same 

time, we also ensure that our production 

facility complies with the government 

environmental standard. With the rapid 

increase in global warming, we strive to be 

environmentally friendly in developing our business responsibly and efficiently 

through conserving resources, and investing in the latest technology to drive 

sustainable development.  

As part of the Group’s initiatives on energy efficiency, we promote the use of 

energy-efficient equipment and devices. Our office building is equipped with 

energy efficient LED lighting to reduce our electrical consumption. In addition, 

we encourage our employees to switch off the office lights during lunch hour 

and to ensure all electrical facilities are switched off after work and when not 

in use. 

Water Management  

Erratic rainfall patterns from climate change impacts the availability of water 

supply. We actively monitor the water consumption in our production and the 

Group strive to reduce the water consumption over the years. We will also 

look for water reuse and alternate water sources whilst ensure the quality of 

water is suited to the purpose of our production.

capacity. From the assessment of the resources consumed in the past year, we 

are looking at several ways that we can improve in terms of conservation of 

resources and we are optimistic that we can reduce our carbon footprint in the 

years to follow. We will keep track of the amount of electricity, water and 

natural gas that we have consumed, as a result of our conservation efforts and 

to present the effectiveness of our initiatives in future reports.  




SUSTAINABILITY TOPIC 

Training and Education

Our Group believes that providing 

comprehensive trainings to the 

employees would upgrade the 

employee skills and also facilitate 

continued 

employability. 

By 

ensuring that our employees are adequately trained, we have provided total 

overall 4.8 hours of training in average for our employees in FY2017. Programs 

such as orientation for newly hired employee, management skills, production 

management and safety management were conducted during FY2017. Besides 

that, our Group implements annual employee performance review for all 

employees to assess results of trainings conducted. Please refer to the table 

below for the number of hours of training attended by the employees in 

FY2017.
