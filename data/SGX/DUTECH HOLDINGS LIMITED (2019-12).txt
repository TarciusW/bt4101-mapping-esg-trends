02

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

On behalf of the board of directors of Dutech

Holdings Limited (“Dutech” or the “Group”), I am

pleased to present our third annual CSR report for

the 2019 financial year from 1st January 2019 to

31st December 2019.

Last year was a challenging year for Dutech on the back

of the current economic headwinds, further threatening

a weakened economy. We took some big strides in

investing in our people, our plants and the community

we work in to achieve our vision of being a supplier for

SmartCity, which would be a more intelligent world in

the near future.

As a manufacturer, we are aware that our operations

are consuming the social resources and have actual

and potential negative impacts on the environment and

community. But we are confident that we can make the

world a better place by providing more intelligent

solutions to improve everyone’s lives.

SUSTAINABLE INITIATIVES

Sustainability is always embedded in our long-term

business plan. We strive to have a positive impact on

the

environment

and

society

and

increasing

shareholder value.

We subscribe to the notion of Sustainability in all our

business

processes

and

systems

and

sustainability is fundamental to our long term business

development.

to

optimise

collection

channels and computing methods in disclosure, and

presented our sustainability strategies, initiatives and

performance

related

to

environmental,

social

and

governance to our stakeholders in more details within

the whole group. We will continue in our approach to

sustainability

with

four

material

pillars,

including

Environment, People, Economics and Community to

ensure the implementation of the sustainability strategy.

COMMITMENT &amp; ASSURANCE

When preparing the report, the Board delegated the

authority

for

daily

management

of

economic

performance, people and environmental topics to the

Sustainability Working Group in Shanghai headquarters

to oversee the sustainability process within the Group

and to ensure the proper and consistent direction of the

all

the

information

from

different

functions.

They

BUSINESS PROFILE

HISTORY AND ORIGIN

Dutech was originally the first Heat Exchanger Manufacturer

in China, established in 1958 and supplied parts to Shanghai

Diesel Engine Corp. Over the years, our business extended

to

auto

parts,

precision

instruments

and

fire-proof

commercial safes. The Group was listed on the Main board

of

the

Singapore

Exchange

Securities

Trading

Limited

(‘SGX-ST’) on 2 August, 2007.

SAFE BUSINESS EXPANSION

The Group grew into a global leading manufacturer of high

security

UL-

and

CEN-certified

products

through

the

international acquisitions of Format Tresorbau Beteiligungs

GmbH in 2011 and Deutsche Mechatronics GmbH in 2014.

BUSINESS TRANSITION

The Group went on to acquire Krauth Technology GmbH in

2015 and Metric Group Limited in 2016. Almex GmbH was

established in 2016 and is involved in the design and

manufacture of intelligent terminals including Ticketing and

Vending Machines (“TVM”) and parking machines.

Through global acquisition, we transitioned from an original

equipment

manufacturer

into

an

original

design

manufacturer. We invested a large amount into building up

our research capability by investing in research manpower

and material resources, and grouped our own R&amp;D Team at

our Shanghai headquarters in 2017.

NEW MOVE

After 2015, in view of rising production costs and other

factors in global trade, we set up overseas factories in

Philippines

and

Vietnam,

which

are

MMT

and

MTC

respectively. MMT achieved RMB 67m revenue and MTC

achieved RMB 44m revenue in 2019.

E-commerce has been an important sales channel of the

Group. In 2019, the group acquired an online sales company

Eisenbach to further increase our online presence.

INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT 

In the year, the Group augmented our capabilities and

expertise in the development of innovative, high technology

solutions. Our Enterprise Technology Center in Nantong,

China, opened from 2015, has obtained a

total of 35

authorized

patents

and

total

of

21

achievement

transformation, all of which have achieved mass production.

Our subsidiary, Jiangsu Tri Star Technology Co., Ltd, was

accorded High and New Technology Enterprise (“HNTE”)

status in China. In total, we have two subsidiaries qualified

as HNTE companies, and were entitled to a preferential

corporate tax rate of 15% as compared to the 25% statutory

rate.

Outside of China region, we established a Software Center,

called Metric Tristarinc Limited, in Cork, Ireland, to further

enhance and achieve greater synergies for our R&amp;D function

across different markets.

Restriction of Hazardous Substances 

(ROHS) Requirement 

Since the new ROHS Directive 2011/65/EU was published in the Official

Journal of the European Union on July 1st , 2011, we responded rapidly.

To ensure this environmental issue is addressed, we enforce the following

measures:

We control production processes by managing chemical substances and

reducing hazardous substances in our products. We also inspect our

finished goods regularly. Inspections have showed that all our products

are qualified under the new RoHS.

We work closely with our suppliers to collect materials information to

ensure the quality of supply. To manage the environmental compliance,

the Group set this requirement as an environmental criteria in the process

of new supplier screening in 2019. We require all our suppliers to ensure

that their materials comply with the European Parliament Directive

2011/65/EU, the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), and

clearly state this warranty clause when renewing supplier contracts.



MATERIAL ESG FACTORS -ENVIRONMENTAL

Environmental Compliance

&lt;307-1, 308-1&gt;

Dutech is always committed to manufacturing products that deliver a

green impact and are compliant with all the environmental requirements.

We have put in place specific guidelines for every step in the

production process to ensure adherence to the requirements of the

ISO14001 environmental management system certification &amp; EN

ISO9001 quality management system certification.

We have designated a full-time environmental specialist to be

responsible

for

the

environmental

management

of

the

daily

operations of all plants in China. He makes monthly report directly

to Managing Director in charge of Asia operation,

Periodic testing and audits are conducted by the environmental

specialist, senior management and external audit to identify any

deficiency in our environmental management system. A total of 95

testing and audits were conducted periodically and aperiodically in

2019.

From the reviews of our environmental specialist, we continually

make improvements to our environmental management system.

We had full compliance with environmental laws and/or regulations

in 2019.

MATERIAL ESG FACTORS - ENVIRONMENTAL

Supplier Environment Assessment

&lt;308-1&amp;2&gt;

Before 2019, Dutech's procurement practices tend to focus on international

sourcing, which may lead to negative environmental impacts: on-going

rising costs of business, higher fuel consumption and exhaust emissions in

the process of delivery.

Dutech improved its procurement practices through developing new local

suppliers

with

Supplier

Environment

Assessment.

We

took

the

environmental impacts, together with the legal, quality and price impacts

into consideration when assessing new local suppliers.

7% of overseas suppliers identified as having significant (both actual and

potential) negative impacts were requested to make improvements going

forward. 14% of overseas suppliers identified as having significant (both

actual and potential) negative impacts were removed from our approved

vendor list. The Group makes more direct purchases from local companies,

including the Chinese subsidiaries or associated companies of our foreign

suppliers to reduce our carbon footprint.

the Group in 2019.

Being supplier for SmartCity




Environmental Footprint

We consume a large amount of water, electricity and fuel in various forms during daily production, which

will have some adverse impacts on environment. Understanding the importance of reducing the negative

environmental impact of our operations, Dutech strives to make more sustainable choices at every step,

from energy sources to materials management and recycling

Energy Consumption &lt;302-1&amp;4&gt;

We consume fuel when running the machines and using inter-plant transportation. To manage the fuel

consumption, we regularly update machines parts or tooling and continuously optimise the horizontal

transport in factories. In 2019, we procured a batch of electric flat trolleys for inter-plant transportation.

This scheme saved 10-20% of labour cost, 30% diesel fuel consumption and 30% maintenance and

inspection fee.

Electricity Consumption in KG standard coal per 10,000 RMB Output dropped from 54.0KG in 2015 to

30.2KG in 2019, largely due to the replacement of air compressors, which resulted in greater efficiency. It

continued to reduce energy consumption by 15.5% in 2019.

Water Consumption &lt;303-5&gt;

Water Consumption in KG per 10,000 RMB Output decreased to 1,037.8KG in 2019, with a decrease of

5.9% versus that in 2018. The decrease is due to the water efficiency design of a new production line.

Materials Management &lt;301-1&gt;

At Dutech, we aim to maximise the use of our raw materials (in particular, steel plates) and reduce any

material wastage by investing in new equipment and upgrading our technology. Dutech is pleased to

maintain a raw material utilisation ratio of more than 90% from 2017 to 2019, achieving our set target.

Environmental Footprint

As a manufacturer, we inevitably create noise, produce waste water, and emit

polluted air with dust in the production process. In product development and

commercial activities, we take environmental protection requirements into full

consideration.

We strictly observe environmental regulations globally, and aim to create

optimal social, economic, and environmental conditions through innovative

solutions. We continuously seek to provide quality products that minimally

influence the environment, while reducing our environmental footprint in the

production.

Sewage Treatment

&lt;306-1&amp;2&gt;

The new sewage treatment station started running at the end of 2018 and

worked well in its first year of operations. It has 17 processes, successfully

diluting the contaminants, like COD, SS and NH3-N, in sewage.

As a result of this new system, we are allowed by the local environment

authority to treat and discharge sewage automatically, instead of outsourcing.

The discharge ceiling of sewage was significantly raised from this year. 100% of

the sewage discharged met the effluent standards set by the local authority.

Between 2018 and 2019, the quantity of sewage that met the effluent standard

has risen to 23,668 tons, with an increase of 12.4% compared to the quantity

discharged in 2018.

Training and Education

&lt; 404-1&amp;2&amp;3 &gt;

At Dutech, we value our people and invest in them for the long-term. We

have put in place an integrated approach to developing talent with equal

opportunities for all. Our HR teams appraise all employees' performance

semiannually.

On top of these performance reviews, they draw up

separate training plans for our workers, administrative staff and young

professionals every year.

Additionally, we focused on mobilising our talent pool through multiple

interactions with subsidiaries all over the world. We are planning regular

study and business visits for our people, sending them to our different

subsidiaries to deepen the understanding of our group and exchange

professional ideas and experience.

Training Focus for 2019:

I.

Online training courses: 56 courses, 1,286 lessons.

Market Presence

&lt;202-2&gt;

Our subsidiaries operate in different cities all over the world. Our hiring

policy is to hire from the local community, specifically for our workers

and majority of middle management. It helps to bring great job

opportunities to the local community and contributes to the local tax

and social security.

We have five plants in Nantong, Jiangsu Province, China. In 2019, we

employed approximately 1,317 workers and 87 administrative staff and

middle management. All of them were hired locally.

For senior management, 98% of them are hired from the local

community.

Procument Practice

&lt;204-1&gt;

To

regulate

the

procurement

behaviour

and

implement

the

procurement process, we updated the procurement control procedures

by classifying materials, increasing local procurement and raising new

suppliers' access threshold.

Localisation of procurement was the focus for 2019. Dutech has changed its

china regional procurement strategy, shifting from global sourcing to local

sourcing. We spent RMB 265million (accounting for approximately 57% of

annual purchases) procuring from the Yangtze River Delta region where

most of our manufacturing bases are located.

Localisation helped Dutech saved RMB 3.4 million in material purchase in

2019. By supporting local suppliers, Dutech can also indirectly attract

additional investment to the local economy. Local sourcing is a strategy to

help ensure supply, support a stable local economy, and maintain community

relations.

Community Engagement

&lt;413-1&gt;

Being a stakeholder in the community we operate in, we are cognizant of the

need to maintain good relations with the local community. We are well

connected with the local tax authorities, local universities, research institutes

and non-profit organisations, such as Red Cross and Disabled Association.
