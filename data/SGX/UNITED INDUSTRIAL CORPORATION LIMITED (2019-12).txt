ABOUT THIS 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT



This is the 3rd sustainability report published by United 

Industrial Corporation Limited (“UIC” or the “Company”, 

and together with its group of companies, the “Group”). 

This report provides data and information on our efforts 

toward managing our material Environmental, Social 

and Governance (“ESG”) issues. 

The UIC Sustainability Report 2019 (“SR2019”) covers 

ESG performance data from our core business 

operations in Singapore including commercial offices, 

retail properties, development projects, information 

technology business and head office in Singapore 

from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. This report 

excludes overseas investments in China and the 

United Kingdom, as well as our hospitality business and 

development projects where we do not have direct 

operational control.

REPORTING STANDARDS AND PRINCIPLES

The SR2019 has been prepared in accordance with 

the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core 

Option, and with reference to GRI’s Construction and 

Real Estate Sector Disclosures. The report complies with 

the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited 

(“SGX-ST”) Listing Rules (711A and 711B), Sustainability 

Reporting Guide. 

GRI’s reporting principles were applied for defining 

SR2019’s report content and quality. The report content 

was determined using the GRI principles of stakeholder 

inclusiveness, materiality, sustainability context and 

completeness. GRI principles of accuracy, balance, 

clarity, comparability, reliability and timeliness were 

duly considered to ensure the quality of information 

in the report.

For the first time in this report, our material ESG topics 

were mapped against the UN Sustainable Development 

Goals (“SDGs”) to indicate how our sustainability efforts 

contribute to sustainable development. The Company is 

committed to continued integration of the SDGs into our 

reporting process for future sustainability reports. Our 

greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions were measured by 

referring to the GHG Protocol.

CEO’S 

STATEMENT



In 2019, we reviewed our sustainability topics to focus our 

efforts on mitigating UIC’s most material ESG risks. In our 

materiality review, we also considered the UN SDGs to 

identify the most relevant targets for UIC . Starting with this 

report, we have integrated the SDGs into our sustainability 

reporting process which will help us measure and 

manage our contribution to sustainable development. 

Our sustainability priorities are economic performance, 

operating energy efficiency, workplace health and 

safety, employee training and regulatory compliance,in 

the operation and management of our commercial 

buildings, retail malls and subsidiary information 

technology business. 

We support Singapore’s Climate Action Plan which 

includes a goal to achieve Building and Construction 

Authority (“BCA”) Green Mark for 80% of all buildings 

in Singapore. As part of our commitment to combat 

climate change, we target to achieve BCA Green Mark 

certification by 2030 for all our commercial buildings 

and retail malls which account for most of our energy 

consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. 

In addition, we are also committed to improving our 

buildings’ energy efficiency to cut GHG emissions. 

Our ability to attract and retain talent is vital for the 

success of our business. We are committed to building 

a highly engaged, motivated and productive workforce. 

We regularly invest in our people’s professional 

and personal development by providing training 

opportunities. 

We remain committed to supporting the local community 

through various corporate social responsibility initiatives 

involving charitable causes and social enterprises with 

employee engagement. 

Finally, building and maintaining sustainable and high-

quality spaces for our customers and tenants remain 

key drivers of UIC’s economic growth. 

On behalf of the Board of Directors of UIC, I invite you to 

read this report to learn more about our sustainability 

practices and efforts towards building a sustainable 

business environment for Singapore.

MATERIALITY



It is fundamental to our sustainability strategy that material 

sustainability issues which are identified, prioritized and 

reported here are those of concern to stakeholders 

and which reflect the Company’s significant economic, 

environmental and social impacts.

Our material sustainability topics were first mapped in 

2017 in a materiality assessment workshop attended 

by the senior management team and representatives 

of various business functions. In 2019, the Company 

reviewed and refreshed these issues in a materiality 

assessment workshop conducted by an external expert. 

We considered megatrends in sustainability, emerging 

issues affecting our industry and reporting by peers in 

our evaluation of material topics. A materiality survey 

was done to gather internal stakeholders’ views to 

prioritise the material ESG issues for sustainability 

reporting. This exercise helped us produce a materiality 

matrix that reflects our priority issues.

STAKEHOLDER 

ENGAGEMENT



Building a relationship with our stakeholders based on 

trust is a crucial driver for the success in our business. 

At UIC, stakeholder engagement is an integral part 

of our sustainability strategy. Through constructive 

engagement, the Company seeks to understand and 

respond to our stakeholders’ views, concerns and 

expectations.

For the purpose of reporting, primary stakeholders 

were first identified through a materiality assessment 

workshop in 2017. Our primary stakeholders are entities 

or individuals who may be significantly affected by our 

business activities; or whose actions can potentially 

affect our operations. UIC’s primary stakeholders include 

our business partners, customers, tenants, employees, 

regulators, investors and local communities.

The Company interacts with our stakeholders through 

various channels, both formal and informal. No 

particular stakeholder group was specifically engaged 

for the preparation of this report. However, insights 

gained from our interactions with stakeholders were 

prudently taken into consideration.

Presented below is an overview of how we engage with 

our stakeholders:

GOVERNANCE



In 2019, the Code of Corporate Governance 2018 (“2018 

Code”) and accompanying Practice Guidance was 

issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”). 

The 2018 Code supersedes the Code of Corporate 

Governance 2012. UIC’s Annual Report 2019 is available 

on its corporate website with detailed information about 

UIC’s corporate governance structure and policies.

The Board has oversight of the sustainability issues 

through the Audit Committee (“AC”) and the Risk 

Management Committee (“RMC”). The AC, through 

the RMC, identifies and prioritises material ESG factors 

and monitors performance. The Sustainability Steering 

Committee (“SSC”) is headed by the President/

CEO and supported by the operational Sustainability 

Working Committee (“SWC”). The SSC is responsible for 

implementing sustainability plans and strategies and 

reports to the RMC. Representatives from various business 

units and relevant functions are dedicated to collecting 

and validating data for sustainability reporting.

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Managing social and environmental risks is part of our 

overall risk management framework. We support the 

precautionary principle by implementing proactive 

measures to avoid and mitigate the negative impacts 

of our operations.

Under our Occupational Health and Safety (“OHS”) 

management system, we maintain a risk register that 

outlines the potential OHS risks present in the organisation. 

We believe that building a risk-aware culture is essential 

to reducing incidents at the workplace.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

The Group is committed to conducting its business 

lawfully 

and 

in 

compliance 

with 

applicable 

regulations. The Legal, Human Resource and Corporate 

Communications teams, through the various heads 

of departments, are responsible for ensuring that 

our employees are kept informed of relevant laws 

and regulations as well as internal policies to avoid 

breaches. All employees are also reminded of the 

Group’s “Code of Conduct”, “Whistle-blowing Policy”, 

“Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy”, “Conflict of 

Interest and Insider Trading” policies through periodic 

internal communications.

In 2019, there were no incidences of regulatory non-

compliance with socio-economic or environmental 

regulations. 

ANTI-BRIBERY AND ANTI-CORRUPTION

The Company takes a zero-tolerance position against 

fraud and corruption. Our Anti-Bribery and anti-

Corruption (“ABC”) policy is aimed at maintaining zero-

tolerance toward dishonest and fraudulent behaviours 

at all levels. The policy is included in the Company’s 

“Code of Conduct” to emphasise the importance of 

adherence to the highest standards of trustworthy and 

ethical behaviour expected of our employees in all 

interactions. 

All new employees duly briefed on our ABC policy are 

required to declare any conflict of interest upon joining 

the company. The ABC policy is also communicated to 

our suppliers, contractors, and business partners.

Fraud and corruption risks are under the purview of the 

Company’s RMC. Internal controls have been established 

at an operational level to reduce opportunities for fraud 

and corruption. 

 

In 2019, there were no incidents of corruption at UIC.

GOVERNANCE



ANTI-COMPETITION

At UIC, we place a strong emphasis on fair competition. 

We comply with Singapore’s Competition Act. There 

were no cases of legal actions for anti-competitive 

behaviour, anti-trust, and monopoly practices against 

UIC in the reported period.

WHISTLE-BLOWING POLICY

We have implemented a “Whistle-blowing Policy” to 

provide employees and external parties a confidential, 

neutral and independent channel to report or feedback 

their concerns in matters related to the Group. The “Whistle-

blowing Policy” is listed on the Company’s corporate 

website at www.uic.com.sg/whistle-blowing-policy. 

All new employee orientation briefings cover the whistle-

blowing procedures. All whistle-blowing cases received 

through designated channels will be reported to the AC. 

 

ETHICAL MARKETING

Across the Group, we follow the principles of ethical 

marketing of our products and services for the sales of 

residential projects and commercial leasing activities. We 

provide product-related information with transparency 

to help customers make informed decisions. We adhere 

to the Singapore Code of Advertising Practice and 

relevant applicable rules and regulations. 

In 2019, there were no incidents of non-compliance 

concerning our marketing practices.

PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION

The Company is committed to ensuring customer 

privacy and personal data protection. We comply with 

Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”) 

and guidelines issued by the Personal Data Protection 

Commission (“PDPC”) to manage and protect personal 

information relating to our customers, shareholders, 

prospects, employees and business partners. Our 

Personal Data Protection Policy requires our employees 

to ensure personal data is only collected, used, stored 

and disposed off in accordance with the PDPA and the 

relevant data privacy laws and guidelines. 

In 2019, the Company received four complaints from 

the PDPC, two of which submitted by visitors to one of 

our commercial buildings concerned the handling 

of personal data by outsourced security personnel, 

following the PDPC’s implementation of the new advisory 

guidelines in respect of NRIC and other national 

identification numbers on 1 September 2019. The 

Company explained to PDPC the lapses and remedial 

actions taken by its outsourced security and no further 

queries were received from PDPC. The remaining two 

cases involving handling of personal data by our staff 

have been officially closed following the Company’s 

confirmation that all necessary measures have been 

taken to ensure compliance with PDPA and PDPC 

guidelines.

Consequently, the Company had stepped up its efforts 

to comply with the PDPA and PDPC guidelines through 

various initiatives by December 2019, including:

a) Comprehensive PDPA training of the Group’s 

Data Protecton Officers (DPOs) and related data 

protection representatives of relevant business units;

b) Raising awareness of nine PDPA principles and 

guidelines among Company’s employees through 

internal campaigns;

c) Reviewing and establishment of internal workflows 

and procedures concerning the collection, usage, 

storage and disposal of personal data, to comply 

with the PDPA and PDPC guidelines.

The 

Company’s 

“Personal 

Data 

Protection 

Policy” is available on our corporate website at  

www.uic.com.sg/disclaimer-privacy-policy.

ENVIRONMENT



Our policy is to minimise the impact of our business 

operations on the environment. We are committed to 

supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy as 

envisioned by the Paris Agreement and the UN SDGs. 

Besides regulatory compliance, our efforts focus on 

proactively measuring, monitoring and mitigating 

significant ecological impacts. Our material environmental 

topics include energy consumption, CO2 emissions and 

water use. The environmental performance data relating 

to our corporate office, retail and commercial buildings, 

development projects and information technology 

business are presented in this chapter.

The Company adheres to national environmental 

standards applicable to our businesses. We also strive 

to adopt international environmental management 

system standards such as the ISO 14001. In 2019, 

West Mall was awarded ISO14001:2015 (Property and 

Facility Management for Shopping Mall) for its efforts 

in meeting the ISO standards for the Environmental 

Management System.

CLIMATE CHANGE

In line with the Paris Agreement on climate change, UIC 

is committed to supporting both national and global 

efforts aimed at limiting the rise in global temperature 

to well below 2 degrees Celsius, while striving to limit the 

increase to 1.5 degrees. 

In 2018, UIC made the ‘Singapore Climate Action 

Pledge’ to support the Year of Climate Action declared 

by the Singapore’s Ministry of the Environment and 

Water Resources. As part of our climate action pledge, 

we have commenced on the replacement of LED 

luminaires for our corporate offices in 2019 and will strive 

for all our investment properties to be BCA Green Mark 

certified by 2030. 

Our subsidiary, Alprop Pte Ltd., which owns and manages 

West Mall had partially attained its 2018 climate action 

goals with 3% reduction in terms of CO2 emission and 

energy consumptions in 2019, against the initial 5% 

reduction target set. Water use however, increased in 

2019 as compared to 2018 due to increased water 

used for cooling the mall’s centralised air-conditioning 

system as a result of higher ambient temperatures 

during several months of the year.

At the operational level, driving energy efficiency during 

construction and in building management remains our 

core priority to limit CO2 emissions linked to our business.

GHG EMISSIONS

Our approach is to minimise emissions intensity through 

energy efficiency measures in project development 

and building management. We track and report CO2 

emissions resulting from the use of electricity across 

our corporate office, buildings (retail and commercial), 

development projects and information technology 

business, and diesel consumed at our development 

project sites. 

In 2019, the total GHG emissions for both commercial 

and retail buildings was 29,383 tonnes of CO2 with a 

GHG emissions intensity of 64.9kg of CO2/m2.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY

The buildings and construction sector accounted for 

36% of energy use and 39% of energy and process-

related CO2 emissions in 2018, according to the 2019 

Global Status Report for Buildings and Construction. A 

major source of energy use and emissions by buildings 

is electricity.

In Singapore, natural gas, a relatively cleaner source 

compared with coal, is the primary fuel for generating 

electricity by power generation companies. Our 

approach is to pursue energy efficiency measures 

such as using passive and low-energy designs to 

minimise energy intensity from the commercial and 

retail properties we manage. For example, our BCA 

Green Mark certified buildings in Singapore promote 

sustainable designs and operational practices that 

contribute to better energy efficiency.

In 2019, we commenced the switch to sustainable 

energy-saving lightings in few of our commercial 

buildings. 

Cooling 

towers 

and 

air-conditioning 

systems were also upgraded progressively in these 

buildings to promote efficient electricity consumptions.  

The total energy (electricity) consumed in both retail 

and commercial buildings was 70,161MWh, with a 

building energy intensity of 155KWh/m2.

Despite energy conservation efforts, energy use in 

2019 witnessed slight increase in most buildings under 

the Group. Besides the reduced efficiency caused 

by a faulty chiller at Marina Square Shopping Mall 

which was subsequently rectified towards the end of 

the year, a few of our office buildings also recorded 

higher electricity consumptions due to extended air-

conditioning hours beyond normal office hours, at the 

requests of buildings’ tenants.

Referencing past years’ data, the Group is able to 

mark the electricity consumption trend of commercial 

buildings. Our target is to reduce electricity intensity of 

our commercial buildings by 8% by 2025, using 2015 as 

the base year. 

From 2020 onwards, we plan to commence the 

monitoring and analysis of electricity usage trends of 

all our commercial buildings, so as to formulate further 

energy saving initiatives. We target to maintain the 

electricity intensity at 149 KWh/m2 in 2020.

WATER

Water stress is one of the emerging sustainability issues 

worldwide. Singapore, in particular, is vulnerable to water 

stress due to the lack of natural freshwater resources. 

Therefore, the prudent use of water and wastewater 

recycling are essential aspects of our environmental 

strategy. Our approach is to reduce water use intensity 

in our buildings and construction.

Our Green Mark certified buildings are equipped 

with an array of water-efficient features and fittings. 

Since 2018, we have implemented various water-

saving initiatives at our buildings to help reduce water 

consumptions. Installations of water efficient taps and 

upgrading of the washroom amentities such as auto 

sensors and flush valves were examples of on-going 

sustainability initiatives

In 2019, the total water consumption in both retail and 

commercial buildings was 533,000 m3, with a building 

water intensity of 1.18m3/m2. The overall water use at our 

retail malls and commercial buildings were marginally 

higher than previous year. Generally, 2019 proved to be 

one of the hottest years on record in Singapore, with the 

annual mean temperature hitting 28.4 °C. This has led to 

increased water use for cooling down chiller units of the 

buildings’ air-conditioning systems for most office buildings. 

Consequently, we aim to commence a water conservation 

awareness programme for our commercial buildings’ 

tenants in 2020. Our target is to achieve a water intensity of 

1.14 m3/m2 for all our commercial buildings by 2025. From 

2020 onwards, our target is to ensure that water intensity 

does not exceed the 2019 level while developing further 

initiatives to meet our 2025 target.

WASTE MANAGEMENT

Waste is generated in our commercial buildings and 

retail malls primarily by tenants and visitors. Almost 

all of the waste generated from our premises is non-

hazardous. All the waste generated is disposed of by 

licensed waste management companies. 

Building Waste

In managing our buildings, we ensure that the waste 

generated by our tenants and visitors to our retail premises 

is responsibly managed and disposed of. Waste is collected 

and stored in designated bins and disposed of through 

licensed waste recycling and management companies.

While we currently do not report waste management data, 

we endeavor to establish an efficient and environment-

friendly waste management and reporting system. With 

more accurate reporting, we strive to engage our retail 

and office tenants in active waste reduction and recycling.

Note: Energy refers to purchased electricity consumption. 

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS

Our subsidiary UIC Technologies Pte Ltd (“UICT”) offers 

solutions in systems integrations, general information 

technology services, payroll software and human 

resource outsourcing services. UICT is an accredited 

Microsoft Cloud Platform (Azure) Gold partner, Microsoft 

Cloud Productivity (Office 365) Gold partner, HP Enterprise 

Platinum partner and DELL Platinum partner.

UICT closely monitors energy consumption and the 

CO2 emissions associated with the use of electricity 

to identify opportunities for reducing its environmental 

footprint. 

UICT’s energy use is mainly attributed to electricity 

required for office lightings, air-conditioning system, as 

well as the operations of computers, servers, copiers 

and relevant office equipment. It was encouraging to 

note that UICT experienced a 20.7% reduction in its 

electricity consumption in 2019 due to the switch of 

40% of its existing office lightings to more sustainable 

energy-saving LED lights. The remaining lightings will be 

progressively changed in phases from 2020 onwards.

The 18.3% increase in water consumption at UICT could 

be attributed to the intensified usage of the newly-

installated water dispenser, and a major office deep-

cleaning exercise. The new water dispenser lowered 

the Company’s reliance on bottled water purchase for 

in-house training classes conducted for clients, and 

promoted better general health for UICT staff.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Compliance with the applicable environmental health 

and safety regulations throughout our operations is 

crucial for our reputation and uninterrupted business 

operation. In development projects, we require our 

contractors to comply with the relevant rules and 

regulations relating to environmental issues such as 

noise, vector control and wastewater discharge.

In 2019, there were no reportable incidents of significant 

non-compliance with environmental laws.

HEALTH 

AND SAFETY



We believe the health and safety of our employees, 

tenants, contractors, customers, guests and visitors to 

our buildings and workers at our development sites 

are our top priorities. We are committed to promoting 

a culture of workplace safety and health across our 

business operations. 

Taking preventive measures to safeguard against 

accidents are essential to our health and safety practices. 

UIC’s senior management regularly reviews the health 

and safety performance across our businesses. Besides 

periodic reviews and evaluations of our operations and 

systems, we also conduct annual audits on our properties 

to ensure compliance with legal requirements.

In Singapore, we follow bizSAFE, a five-step national 

programme to help companies build up capabilities 

in addressing workplace safety, health and security. In 

2019, we renewed our bizSAFE Level 3 certification for 

Marina Square Shopping Mall. For UIC Building, our 

facility management services provider has attained 

bizSAFE Level Star, the highest level achievable for 

certification by bizSAFE.

We have implemented a comprehensive OHS policy to 

prevent accidents and minimise health and safety risks 

at project sites as well as for the buildings we manage.

BUILDINGS

Emergency Response Teams are set up in the buildings 

we manage to prepare employees for emergencies. 

We have implemented the necessary measures to ensure 

the fire safety of the properties under our management. 

The buildings are fitted out with advanced fire control 

equipment. We organise periodic fire drills to raise the 

fire safety awareness of our buildings’ occupants and to 

evaluate the readiness of our fire fighting teams in the 

event of an emergency. We have established standard 

operating procedures and training for our building 

management employees and occupants to ensure an 

orderly response to fire emergencies.

Preventive maintenance and inspection of all lifts and 

escalators in our buildings are conducted regularly to 

keep them reliable and safe for use.

We also ensure the highest levels of cleanliness and 

hygiene in the common areas of the buildings under our 

management. The health and safety of the tenants and 

visitors to the buildings we manage are our top priorities.

UIC regularly tracks the safety performance of its buildings 

and review its OHS policy and practices. In 2019, there were 

no fatal or non-fatal injuries, and there were no reported 

incidents of occupational diseases. The number of lost 

days was ten during the year, which was a continuation 

from a reported injury in 2018. Currently, we do not report 

AFR and ASR for buildings as we do not track man-hours 

worked for our employees and contractors.

Please refer to Sustainability Performance Data on page 

31 for more details.

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS

As developers, we understand that project sites are 

prone to accidents and present workplace safety and 

health hazards. Our approach is to adhere strictly to 

statutory regulations and our OHS policy and practices, 

in order to maintain healthy, safe and zero-accident 

workplaces for our projects under constructions. 

We require all main contractors to hold the OHSAS 

18001 or an equivalent certification to ensure a robust 

occupational health and safety management system. 

Our contractors are engaged through weekly meetings 

where safety reports, safety challenges and preventive 

actions were reviewed and discussed. We strongly 

encourage our contractors to report on all near-

misses incidents so that preventive measures can be 

taken proactively to promote a strong health &amp; safety 

culture. By regulatory requirement, external safety audits 

are conducted twice yearly. The auditor’s reports are 

reviewed by our consultants and are submitted to the 

Ministry of Manpower for their necessary action, if any.

To promote safe practices at our development projects, 

we engaged our contractors and sub-contractors by 

reviewing and simplifying the work processes with the 

objective of reducing or eliminating all safety issues on site.

We had only one active development project in 2019. 

There were no fatal injuries during the year. The target 

set for 2019 was zero recordable incidents at both 

workplace and project sites. However, only the target for 

workplace has been achieved, as there was one non-

fatal injury at the project sites that resulted in 42 lost 

man days. The total number of man-hours worked at the 

project sites in 2019 was 387,540.

the personal growth of our employees, we sponsor 

curriculums that build leadership and management 

skills besides the usual technical and functional training.

We aim to maximize the value of learning and 

development investments through conducting training 

needs analysis, effective engagement with training 

providers, establishing a structured process to evaluate 

training effectiveness, capitalizing on training subsidies 

and grants provided by the government, leveraging on 

online resources and educational platforms to deliver 

learning solutions designed to optimize business and 

customer outcomes.

PEOPLE



In 2019, the Company implemented the SAP system for 

better enterprise resource planning, as well as E-Leave 

and E-Payslip systems where employees were extensively 

trained for proficiency in these systems. As a result, there 

was a synthetic spike in the increase of total training hours.

Our commitment and investment in learning and 

development serve as the foundation for our employees’ 

career development. In alignment with our corporate 

business strategy, the Company is also committed to 

fostering a learning culture within the organization. Our

HIRING AND TURNOVER

In 2019, voluntary turnover rate for the property business 

was 11.1%, as compared to the 13.8% in 2018, which was 

well below national industry average for real estate services.

As a Group, UIC hired 45 new employees in 2019, of 

which 42% were women. Employee turnover for the year 

was recorded as 16.5%, inclusive of both voluntary and 

involuntary turnover.

PEOPLE



Through our employee engagement programs, learning 

and development opportunities, and cohesive work 

environment, we target to achieve a 12% or lower average 

annual voluntary turnover rate for property business.

PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT

Our performance management system serves as 

an essential tool for the Company in building a high 

performance corporate culture, where respective 

managers are held accountable for their ultimate 

performance achieved through clear goal-setting, 

coaching and feedback. 

Employees are expected to deliver strong and sustained 

performance, measured by the achievement of their 

goals and the demonstration of desired behaviours to 

achieve these goals. All full-time employees participate 

in 

annual 

performance 

appraisals 

conducted 

objectively and transparently. The Company provides 

rewards and compensation in commensuration with 

employees’ performance.

SOCIAL SECURITY

All 

our 

Singaporean 

and 

Permanent 

Resident 

employees are covered by the Central Provident 

Fund (CPF), which is a comprehensive social security 

savings plan managed by the CPF Board under the 

Ministry of Manpower. The CPF, a comprehensive social 

security plan, helps employees to fund their retirement, 

healthcare, home ownership, family protection and 

asset enhancement.

RE-EMPLOYMENT

The UIC Group supports the rehiring of retiring 

employees beyond the statutory retirement age of 62 

years. We offer re-employment contracts on an annual 

renewal basis to eligible employees who continue to 

utilize their skills and expertise, enabling them to stay 

productive in the workforce. In 2019, we re-employed 16 

retiring employees. 

HUMAN RIGHTS

Non-discrimination

Our approach is to promote a diverse and inclusive 

workplace culture based on merit and performance. 

UIC, a signatory to the Tripartite Alliance for Fair 

Employment Practices (TAFEP) pledge, is committed to 

applying fair, responsible and progressive employment 

practices in all our interactions with employees internally 

and dealings with external stakeholders.

In 2019, there were no incidents of discrimination.

Freedom of Association

We respect our employees’ right to join a lawful 

labour union. As of 31 December 2019, 22% of our 

employees were represented by Singapore Industrial 

and Services Employees’ Union (SISEU) and Union of 

Security Employees (USE) and they were covered by the 

respective Collective Bargaining Agreements.

COMMUNITY



As the Group strives towards good corporate citizenship, 2019 saw our participation in several 

community initiatives throughout the year, for the benefit of the underprivileged and marginalized people in 

society. In partnership with various local organisations, we supported social programmes through volunteering, 

fundraising and donations.

Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program lined up several events in 2019, engaging employees’ 

involvement and participation in volunteering their services. We registered a total of 118 volunteer hours during 

the year from two main activities.





In August, 12 employees of UIC lent their 

hands to help with meal preparations 

at the Willing Hearts, a non-affliated 

charity 

which 

prepares, 

cooks 

and 

distributes approximately 6,500 meals to 

the less-privileged beneficiaries island-

wide. It was tiring yet fun and fulfilling 

for the group of volunteers made up of 

executives, non-executives, as well as 

senior management staff.

COMMUNITY



The “Blossom Day Out @ The Gardens” 

excursion to Gardens By the Bay in 

September was arranged for 14 UIC 

volunteers and 25 seniors from Blossom 

Seeds Senior Activity Centre, to foster 

active 

association 

with 

the 

senior 

community, as well as to promote active 

aging and harmonious living. This special 

hot September day ended with laughters, 

new friendships and greater bonding 

among colleagues.

PERFORMANCE DATA



Restatements:

^ 

Electricity, energy and GHG emissions data for Corporate Office for 2018 were restated to show comparable year-to-year consumption data. The 

data was extrapolated based on 74.9MWh electricity consumed in the period of 20 Jul – 31 Dec 2018.

* 

Electricity, energy, GHG emissions and water data (absolute and intensity) for commercial buildings for 2017 and 2018 were restated to exclude 

Novena Square ( a 20:80 joint venture between UIC and UOL ). The GHG emissions data for 2017 was also restated using the 2016 electricity grid 

emission factor from the Energy Market Authority (EMA).

# 

No. of man days lost in 2018 was restated to exclude Public Holidays.

Notes:

1. 

Buildings (Retail) refer to Marina Square Mall (excluding Marina Square Hotels) and West Mall.

2. 

Buildings (Commercial) refer to Clifford Centre, Singapore Land Tower, SGX Centre, The Gateway, Stamford Court, Abacus Plaza, Tampines Plaza 

and UIC Building (since 2018). 

3. 

There was one (6) development projects in 2017, seven (7) in 2018, and one (6) in 2019. The development project in 2019 refers to The Tre Ver, a 

50:50 joint venture with UOL. 

4. 

Energy refers to purchased electricity consumption. For development projects, energy data also includes fuel (diesel) consumption. 

5. 

Our corporate office sits within Clifford Centre (Level 22 and 24) and forms a subset of the building energy and GHG emissions reported. 

6. 

GHG emissions calculations are based on the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. GHG emissions for purchased electricity refer to carbon dioxide 

gas (CO2). Singapore electricity grid emission factor from 2016 to 2018 was used to derive CO2 emissions; GHG emissions for diesel refer to CO2, 

CH4 and N2O. Greenhouse Gas Protocol Emission Factors from Cross Sector Tools, March 2017 were used to derive CO2e emissions.

7. 

Water used at all our properties is from municipal sources.

8. 

Water data for Corporate Office is unavailable, as water is not separately metered. 

9. 

Environmental data for all Buildings includes general water consumption of common toilets and pantries, as well as central air-conditioning 

systems, except for individual tenant’s office equipment electricity usage. Environment data for SGX Centre represents UIC Group’s 48.6% 

ownership share of the property.

10. Intensity calculations for all Buildings use Gross Floor Area (GFA) as the denominator. We adopt BCA’s definition for Gross Floor Area (GFA). All 

covered floor areas of a building, except otherwise exempted, and uncovered areas for commercial uses, are deemed the gross floor area of 

the building. Generally, car parks are excluded from GFA computation.

11. For development projects, 100% of the environmental data was reported. Intensity calculations use value of work completed as the denominator.

12. Calculation formula: AFR = (No. of Injuries / Total Man Hours) x 1,000,000, ASR = (Lost of Man Day / Total Man Hours) x 1,000,000

13. AFR and ASR reported for development projects include main contractors’ and subcontractors’ hours. UIC does not track total man-hours 

worked for our employees and contractors based at our buildings, and are therefore currently unable to disclose the AFR and ASR.

14. Average training hours per employee = Total training hours for the year / Number of employees as at 31 Dec.

15. For employee data in 2018, temporary and fixed-term employees were reported under one category.

ASSURANCE REPORT



To the Directors of UIC Ltd

CONCLUSION

We were engaged by the Board of Directors of United 

Industrial Corporation Limited (“UIC”, or the “Company”, 

and together with its group of companies, the “Group”) 

to provide limited assurance on the accompanying 

UIC Sustainability Report 2019 for the year ended 31 

December 2019 (the “Report”), and the selected Global 

Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards 

disclosures (Selected GRI Disclosures) as identified below.

Based on the evidence we obtained from the procedures 

performed as described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities 

section of our report, nothing has come to our attention 

that causes us to believe that:

(a) the Report has not described the sustainability 

practices on a comply-or-explain basis with 

reference to the following components as listed 

under Rule 711B of the Singapore Exchange’s 

(SGX) Listing Manual;

 

– Material environmental, social and governance 

factors;

 

– Policies, practices and performance;

 

– Targets;

 

– Sustainability reporting framework; and

 

– Board statement; and

(b) the Selected GRI Disclosures as identified in the 

table below, are not calculated, in all material 

respects, in accordance with the relevant topic-

specific disclosures requirements in the GRI 

Standards.

ASSURANCE REPORT



BASIS FOR CONCLUSION

We conducted our limited assurance engagement in 

accordance with Singapore Standard on Assurance 

Engagement 3000 Assurance Engagements other than 

Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information 

(SSAE 3000). Our responsibilities are further described in 

the Auditors’ Responsibilities section of our report.

We have complied with the independence and other 

ethical requirements of the Accounting and Corporate 

Regulatory Authority (ACRA) Code of Professional 

Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and 

Accounting Entities (ACRA Code), which is founded 

on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, 

professional competence and due care, confidentiality 

and professional behaviour.

Our firm applies Singapore Standard on Quality Control 

1 and, accordingly, maintains a comprehensive system 

of quality control including documented policies 

and procedures regarding compliance with ethical 

requirements, professional standards and applicable 

legal and regulatory requirements.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT

Management is responsible for: 

– preparing and presenting the Report in accordance 

with the GRI Standards and Rule 711B of the SGX 

Listing Manual, and the information and assertions 

contained within it; 

– determining UIC’s objectives in respect of sustainable 

development performance and reporting, including 

the identification of stakeholders and material issues; 

– establishing and maintaining appropriate internal 

control systems that enable the preparation and 

presentation of the Report and the selected GRI 

disclosures that are free from material misstatement, 

whether due to fraud or error; 

– preventing and detecting fraud and for identifying 

and ensuring that the Company complies with laws 

and regulations applicable to its activities; and

– ensuring that staff involved with the preparation 

and presentation of the Report are properly trained, 

information systems are properly updated and that 

any changes in reporting encompass all significant 

reporting units.

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the 

Company’s sustainability reporting process.

AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES

Our responsibility is to carry out a limited assurance 

engagement in accordance with SSAE 3000 and to 

express a conclusion based on the work performed. 

SSAE 3000 requires that we plan and perform the 

engagement to obtain limited assurance about 

whether the Report is free from material misstatement. 

The extent of our work performed depends on our 

professional judgement and our assessment of the 

engagement risk. 

A limited assurance engagement consists of making 

inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the 

preparation of information presented in the Report, 

and applying analytical and other evidence gathering 

procedures, as appropriate. These procedures included:

– Inquiries of management to gain an understanding 

of UIC’s processes for determining the material issues 

for UIC’s key stakeholder groups;

– Interviews with senior management and relevant 

staff at group level and selected business unit level 

concerning sustainability strategy and policies for 

material issues, and the implementation of these 

across the business;

– Interviews with relevant staff at the corporate and 

business unit level responsible for providing the 

information in the Report;

– Visits to offices and data centres operating in 

Singapore selected on the basis of a risk analysis 

including the consideration of both quantitative 

and qualitative criteria;

– Inquiries of the design and implementation of the 

systems and methods used to collect and report on 

the GRI Disclosures, including the aggregation of the 

reported information;

– Comparison of the GRI Disclosures presented in the 

Report to corresponding information in the relevant 

underlying sources to determine whether all the 

relevant information contained in such underlying 

sources has been appropriately included in the GRI 

Disclosures; and

– Reading of the information presented in the Report 

to determine whether it is in line with our overall 

knowledge of, and experience with, the sustainability 

performance of the Company.

The procedures performed in a limited assurance 

engagement vary in nature and timing from, and 

are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance 

engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance 

obtained in a limited assurance engagement is 

substantially lower than the assurance that would 

have been obtained had a reasonable assurance 

engagement been performed.

Due to the inherent limitations of any internal control 

structure it is possible that errors or irregularities in the 

information presented in the Report may occur and 

not be detected. Our engagement is not designed to 

detect all weaknesses in the internal controls over the 

preparation and presentation of the Report, as the 

engagement has not been performed continuously 

throughout the period and the procedures performed 

were undertaken on a test basis.

RESTRICTION ON USE

This report has been prepared for the Directors of UIC Ltd 

for the purpose of providing an assurance conclusion 

on the Report and Selected GRI Disclosures and may 

not be suitable for another purpose. We disclaim any 

assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this 

report, to any person other than the Directors of UIC 

Ltd, or for any other purpose than that for which it was 

prepared.
