densely populated areas with good connectivity 

to public transport. The malls are positioned as 

one-stop family-oriented destinations that offer 

essential services and house a wide range of lifestyle 

offerings that cater to varied consumer preferences 

in shopping, dining and entertainment. CLCT’s 

portfolio includes a diverse mix of leading brands

and railways to serve the growing domestic logistic 

needs of China’s Eastern, Central and Southwest 

regions. Fitted with high-tech and modern features 

to meet a wide range of e-commerce and logistics 

requirements, the properties are anchored by

Corporate Profile 

CapitaLand China Trust 

02






CapitaLand China Trust (CLCT) is Singapore’s largest China-focused real estate investment trust (REIT). This is 

CLCT’s maiden Integrated Sustainability Report (ISR), and it aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the 

organisation’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance.

INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES

This report is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards “Core” option, 

and the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited’s (SGX-ST) Listing Manual Rules 711A and 711B. The 

GRI Standards have been selected as it is an internationally recognised sustainability reporting framework 

that covers a wide range of disclosures that is relevant to CLCT. This Report incorporated elements of the 

Integrated Reporting (IR) Framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council and references the 

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN). CLCT has embarked on reviewing and 

executing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in this 

Report.

REPORTING SCOPE AND PERIOD

CLCT is managed by CapitaLand China Trust Management Limited (the Manager), a wholly-owned subsidiary 

of Singapore-listed CapitaLand Investment Limited (CLI), one of Asia’s largest diversified real estate groups. 

The Manager and property management teams that are responsible for the REIT as well as the property 

and portfolio operations of CLCT, are identified as employees of the REIT. The independent members of the 

Board (which is part of the Manager) are not employees of the REIT.

This Report covers 22 properties within CLCT’s portfolio for the financial period from 1 January 2021 to 31 

December 2021 (FY 2021) - 13 retail properties (including two divested in FY 2021), five business parks and 

four logistics parks properties, unless otherwise stated.

Taking guidance from the operational control as defined by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Corporate 

Standard, the environmental performance of 15 properties which are under operational control have been 

covered in this Report. These properties are CapitaMall Xizhimen, Rock Square, CapitaMall Wangjing, 

CapitaMall Grand Canyon, CapitaMall Xuefu, CapitaMall Xinnan, CapitaMall Nuohemule, CapitaMall 

Yuhuating, CapitaMall Aidemengdun, CapitaMall Qibao, Ascendas Xinsu Portfolio, Ascendas Innovation 

Towers, Ascendas Innovation Hub, Singapore-Hangzhou Science &amp; Technology Park Phase I and Singapore-

Hangzhou Science &amp; Technology Park Phase II. As the Manager and property management teams do not have 

operational control of CapitaMall Shuangjing, Shanghai Fengxian Logistics Park, Kunshan Bacheng Logistics 

Park, Wuhan Yangluo Logistics Park and Chengdu Shuangliu Logistics Park, these properties will be excluded 

from the calculation of CLCT’s environmental performance. CLCT’s FY 2021 environmental performance also 

excludes both CapitaMall Minzhongleyuan and CapitaMall Saihan as these properties were divested in FY 

2021 and not operational during the year.

This Report is to be read in conjunction with CLCT’s Annual Report 2021.

Board Statement

At CapitaLand China Trust, sustainability is at 

the core of everything we do. We are committed 

to growing in a responsible manner, delivering 

long term economic value, and contributing to 

the environmental and social well-being of our 

communities. The material environmental, social and 

governance (ESG) factors have been identified and 

encapsulated in the CapitaLand 2030 Sustainability 

Master Plan, which was launched in 2020, and will 

be reviewed by the Board of the Manager of CLCT 

together with management every two years.

The CapitaLand 2030 Sustainability Master Plan 

steers our efforts on a common course to maximise 

impact through building a resilient and resource 

efficient real estate portfolio, enabling thriving 

and future-adaptive communities, and accelerating 

sustainability 

innovation 

and 

collaboration. 

Ambitious ESG targets have been set which include 

carbon emissions reduction targets validated by the 

Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

The Board of the Manager of CLCT is responsible for 

overseeing the Company’s sustainability efforts, and 

takes ESG factors into consideration in determining 

its strategic direction and priorities. The Board also 

approves the executive compensation framework 

based on the principle of linking pay to performance. 

The Manager’s business plans are translated to both 

quantitative and qualitative performance targets, 

including sustainable corporate practices and are 

cascaded throughout the organisation.

We are pleased to present CLCT’s first stand-alone 

Integrated Sustainability Report (ISR) for FY 2021. 

This Report is an affirmation of our commitment 

to sustainability and reinforces the view that 

sustainability is intrinsically linked to how we deliver 

value to our stakeholders. With this standalone 

report, we seek to highlight in greater detail our 

sustainability approach, measures implemented 

during the year, performance of our material topics, 

and our ESG targets.

 

RECOGNISING THE IMPORTANCE OF 

SUSTAINABILITY

Our sustainability efforts are guided by CapitaLand, 

one of the leading real estate companies driven 

by sustainability. Together with the CapitaLand 

Sustainability Council, we identified and managed the 

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) related 

issues and considered the key risks and opportunities 

when formulating the sustainability strategies for 

CLCT. This includes assessing climate-related risks 

and opportunities as part of overall environmental 

risk management to improve business resilience. 

This approach has been disclosed in this Report in 

accordance with the TCFD recommendations. 

We are also proud to announce the formation of 

CLCT’s 

Sustainability 

Management 

Committee, 

spearheaded by the CEO and supported by the senior 

management heads, which aims to further integrate 

sustainability into all aspects of our business strategy.

Board Message

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

Since the onset of COVID-19, we have stepped up 

engagement with all stakeholders, ensuring strict 

compliance with advisories, laws and regulations 

to safeguard the health and safety of all. This 

includes increasing the frequency of disinfection and 

sanitation measures across all CLCT’s properties and 

distributing masks to our tenants and customers. 

Recognising the impacts of COVID-19 on jobs and 

livelihoods, Ascendas Xinsu Portfolio collaborated 

with professional recruitment platforms to conduct 

annual offline recruitment drives in the park 

focusing on the modern service industries, including 

but not limited to information technology, software 

development, 

environmental 

protection 

and 

energy conservation. The event was recognised and 

supported by the Secretary of the Party Working 

Committee of the Dushu Lake Science and Education 

Innovation Zone, which is one of the key education 

hubs in Suzhou.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY MILESTONES AND 

ACCOLADES

In September 2021, CLCT obtained its maiden 

sustainability-linked loan of S$150 million and is the 

leading REIT in Singapore to pioneer a sustainability-

linked loan for a China portfolio.

We are honoured to be conferred a GRESB 3 Star 

Rating and a score of 77 for our first participation in 

the GRESB Real Estate Assessment 2021, a global ESG 

performance benchmark for real estate. In addition, 

we obtained an “A” for GRESB Public Disclosure 

Assessment 2021 with a score of 94, ranking 1st 

amongst seven Singapore Retail Constituents. 

These 

accolades 

acknowledged 

our 

diligent 

efforts to continuously improve our sustainability 

performance. We would also like to thank all our 

stakeholders for their support as we strive to reach 

greater heights in CLCT’s sustainability journey.

Sustainability Commitment

In 2020, CapitaLand unveiled its 2030 Sustainability 

Master Plan (SMP) to elevate its commitment towards 

global sustainability in the built environment. The 

Master Plan focuses on three key pillars to drive 

CapitaLand’s sustainability efforts in the ESG pillars, 

enabling CapitaLand to create a larger positive 

impact for the environment and society:

• Build portfolio resilience and resource efficiency, 

• Enable thriving and future-adaptive communities, 

as well as 

• Accelerate 

sustainability 

innovation 

and 

collaboration

As a CLI-sponsored REIT, CLCT aligns its sustainability 

objectives and strategies with CapitaLand. It is 

committed to improving the economic and social 

well-being of its stakeholders through management 

of human capital, asset, portfolio operations and 

project development. CLCT will steer towards the 

pathways set by CapitaLand and keep adapting its 

strategies as technologies evolve and new scientific 

data become available. The Manager works closely 

with the Asset &amp; Property Managers in carrying out 

these strategies and relevant activities across its 

portfolio where possible.

CapitaLand has identified five pathways to achieve 

its sustainability objectives and will adapt its 

strategies as technologies evolve and new scientific 

data become available: 

Integrate sustainability in CapitaLand’s real estate life cycle 

From the earliest stage of its investment process to the design, procurement, 

construction, operations and redevelopment or divestment of assets, 

sustainability targets will be embedded in policies, processes, best practices, 

and key performance indicators of its business operations.

Leverage sustainability trends and data analytics 

This allows CapitaLand to track critical performance and progress in water usage, 

waste management, energy consumption, carbon emission, and health and safety. 

These measurements along with social indicators are key to driving performance 

improvement across its operating properties and development projects.

Strengthen innovation and collaboration to drive sustainability 

CapitaLand will continue to source globally for new ideas and technologies to 

meet its sustainability ambitions and work with like-minded partners to create 

shared values and key performance indicators of its business operations.

Monitor and report progress to ensure transparency 

As CapitaLand tracks its sustainability progress, it will continue to validate its 

performance by external assurance and align its Global Sustainability Report 

to international standards.

Increase engagement and communication with key stakeholders 

It is key to build awareness among its employees, investors, customers and 

communities, and collectively effect transformational change to achieve 

CapitaLand’s 2030 targets.

Sustainability Commitment

PUSH BOUNDARIES OF CHANGE 

To push the boundaries of change, CapitaLand will 

transit to a low-carbon business that is aligned with 

climate science. In November 2020, it had its carbon 

emissions reduction targets approved by the Science 

Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for a ‘well-below 2°C’ 

scenario. The targets are in line with the goals of the 

Paris Agreement to keep global temperature rise 

well below 2°C in this century. CapitaLand is also 

developing a new metric, Return on Sustainability, 

in addition to the regular financial return to measure 

the CapitaLand’s ESG impact.

CapitaLand 

has 

also 

launched 

the 

inaugural 

CapitaLand Sustainability X Challenge (CSXC), the 

first sustainability focused innovation challenge by 

a Singapore headquartered real estate company 

that globally sources for emerging sustainability 

technologies and solutions in the built environment. 

The CSXC covers seven challenge statements and 

reflect the key themes and goals in CapitaLand’s 

2030 Sustainability Master Plan.

CapitaLand aims to be a leader in sustainable finance 

and secure S$6 billion of sustainable financing 

by 2030. Proceeds and interest rate savings from 

CapitaLand’s efforts in sustainable finance can also 

be used to drive more sustainability initiatives and 

innovations within the company.

MEASURED AGAINST GLOBAL BENCHMARKS 

CapitaLand was one of the first companies in 

Singapore to voluntarily publish an annual Global 

Sustainability Report and externally assure the entire 

report. Benchmarking against an international 

standard and framework that is externally validated 

helps the organisation to overcome the challenges 

in sustainability reporting that may arise from its 

portfolio of diverse asset types and geographical 

presence globally.

CapitaLand is also a signatory to the United 

Nations (UN) Global Compact and its Global 

Sustainability Report serves as its Communication 

on Progress, which will be made available at www.

unglobalcompact.org when published. 

For its efforts, CapitaLand is listed in the Global 100 

Most Sustainable Corporations Index, Dow Jones 

Sustainability World Index and Asia-Pacific Index, 

Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (Global 

Sector Leader, Diversified- Listed), FTSE4Good 

Index Series, MSCI Global Sustainability Indexes and 

The Sustainability Yearbook. CapitaLand Global 

Sustainability Report 2021 will be published by 31 

May 2022.

CapitaLand’s sustainability management comes under the purview of the CapitaLand Sustainability Council. 

The Sustainability Council comprises selected CLI Board’s independent directors and members of the 

CapitaLand Executive Committee. It is supported by the Group Sustainability Office and various work teams 

to drive continued progress and improvement in the areas of ESG. It was chaired by one of CLI Board’s 

independent directors and member of its Executive Resource and Compensation Committee and Risk 

Committee. The work teams comprise representatives from CapitaLand business units (BU) and corporate 

functions. Each BU has its own Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Committee to drive initiatives in 

countries where the CapitaLand operates with support from various departments.

CLCT’S SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE

Within the Manager, a Sustainability Management Committee (SMC) was established to allow greater focus 

on sustainability and climate-related matters for CLCT’s assets. The SMC is chaired by CLCT’s CEO and comprises 

senior management team members to oversee CLCT’s sustainability objectives and strategies directly. The 

SMC is also responsible for providing timely and regular updates on the REIT’s sustainability matters to CLCT’s 

Board of Directors.

The SMC is supported by CLCT’s Sustainability Working Committee (SWC), which comprises key members 

from various business functions, to implement sustainability-related activities and initiatives across CLCT’s 

operations per CapitaLand’s sustainability framework and policies.

Materiality 

As CLCT is a CLI-sponsored REIT, CapitaLand’s 

ESG material issues have been deemed material 

and applicable to CLCT’s business and operations. 

CapitaLand has a regular review, assessment and 

feedback process in relation to ESG topics. Key to this 

is an annual CapitaLand-wide Risk and Control Self-

Assessment exercise which entails the identification, 

assessment and documentation of material risks 

and corresponding internal controls. These material 

risks include fraud and corruption, environmental 

(e.g. climate change), health and safety, and human 

capital risks which are ESG-relevant.

Guided by the 2030 Sustainability Master Plan, 

CapitaLand elevated its commitment to global 

sustainability in the built environment, identifying 

and reviewing material issues that are most relevant 

and significant to CapitaLand and its stakeholders. 

With 

the 

restructuring 

of 

CapitaLand 

into 

CapitaLand Investment Limited (CLI) and CapitaLand 

Development Pte. Ltd. (CLD), these ESG material issues 

are prioritised based on the likelihood and potential 

impact of issues affecting business continuity of CLI. 

The Board of the Manager of CLCT is responsible for 

reviewing these material ESG factors and takes them 

into consideration when determining CLCT’s strategic 

direction and priorities. The Board also oversees the 

management and monitoring of the material ESG 

factors. For external stakeholders, priority is given to 

issues important to the society and applicable to CLI. 

For more information on stakeholder engagement, 

please refer to the Social and Relationship Capital 

chapter on page 33 to 36 of this ISR.

Strategy and Key Objectives 

CLCT’S INVESTMENT STRATEGY

 

CLCT is committed to delivering long-term sustainable 

distributions to Unitholders. Our forward-looking 

portfolio reconstitution strategy is closely aligned 

with China’s dual circulation strategy, which focuses 

on growing exports and domestic consumption. 

As Singapore’s largest China-focused REIT with a 

diversified portfolio of retail, business park and 

logistics assets across 12 prominent top tier cities, 

CLCT is well poised to capture China’s economic 

growth.

Our investment strategy is designed to Create, 

Unlock and Extract Value across our portfolio. Driven 

by disciplined portfolio reconstitution, proactive 

asset management, innovative asset enhancement, 

and underpinned by prudent capital and risk 

management, we continue our strong track record 

of enhancing value for our Unitholders.

Strategic advantages and growth potential is further 

realised by leveraging on our Sponsor’s extensive 

pipeline 

of 

high-quality 

assets. 

Operational 

excellence 

is 

reinforced 

through 

CapitaLand’s 

integrated real estate platform, strong local network 

and professional property management capabilities.

VALUE CREATION AND ALIGNMENT TO UNITED 

NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS 

(UN SDGS)

The Guiding Principles of the International Integrated 

Reporting Council (IIRC) Framework were referenced 

in this report and the material ESG issues are grouped 

into six Capitals – Environmental, Manufactured, 

Human, Social &amp; Relationship, Organisational and 

Financial. These Capitals are mapped against eight 

UN SDGs that are most aligned with the CapitaLand 

Sustainability Master Plan 2030 targets, and where 

CLCT can achieve the greatest positive impact.

Sustainability During COVID-19

NAVIGATING COVID-19 WITH STAKEHOLDERS

CLCT rolled out numerous measures to control the 

outbreak and ensure business continuity across all 

properties. Mask-wearing, green health QR code 

scanning for contact tracing and temperature 

screening were made compulsory for visitors and 

employees. CLCT’s properties undergo thorough 

cleaning, with additional frequency imposed on key 

areas such as elevators and toilets. Air conditioning 

and ventilation systems are disinfected and cleaned 

weekly. 

If tenants and/or visitors are found to test positive 

for COVID-19, the individuals will be isolated and 

the affected areas will be closed for disinfection. 

Apart from regular cleaning, CapitaMall Nuohemule 

utilised robots provided by the Hohhot Bureau of 

Commerce to disinfect and maintain clean air quality. 

CLCT has designated COVID-19 Emergency Testing 

Points and held vaccination drives for employees 

across its properties to support governmental 

measures.

Other COVID-19 initiatives implemented in the year 

include:

• COVID-19 emergency drills that ensure employees 

are able to limit the spread of COVID-19 and 

conduct regular inventory checks on personal 

protective equipment such as masks 

• Distribution 

of 

vaccination 

pamphlets 

and 

updating the community of tenants’ vaccination 

status 

• Distribution of masks and care packages to 

tenants and visitors 

• Daily disinfection of public areas at regular 

intervals, with increased frequency for high 

contact areas such as elevator buttons, door 

handles, elevator cars, toilets, and fire passages

• Training on COVID-19 control and preventive 

measures for employees and suppliers

Environmental

ENVIRONMENTAL AND MANUFACTURED 

CAPITAL

Our Approach to Environmental Management

CLCT is aligned with CapitaLand’s commitment to 

minimise its environmental impact and contribute 

towards desired positive outcomes for the benefit of 

stakeholders. 

CLCT 

strives 

to 

implement 

and 

integrate 

environmentally friendly features in its properties 

and improve overall energy efficiency. The asset 

enhancement initiatives (AEI) undertaken also 

consider environmental sustainability. Monitoring 

environmental impact is an important part of 

CLCT’s business operations, as the efficient use 

and management of environmental resources such 

as energy, water and waste contributes to higher 

efficiency and sustainability of CLCT’s portfolio. 

Managing Environmental Footprint 

CapitaLand’s Environmental Management System 

(EMS) is a key tool in managing CLCT’s environmental 

footprint across its portfolio. The EMS is integrated 

with CapitaLand’s Occupational, Health and Safety 

Management System (OHSMS) to form CapitaLand’s 

Environmental, Health and Safety Management 

System (EHSMS) that complies with ISO 14001 and 

ISO 45001 standards. The ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 

standards are recognised internationally for the 

environmental management of businesses and 

occupational health and safety management of 

businesses respectively. 

Risk Management of Environmental Aspects and 

Impact 

The EHSMS provides a systematic process to manage 

CLCT’s environmental impact and continuously 

improve 

its 

environmental 

performance, 

by 

identifying and managing potential risks that may 

result in a negative impact on the environment. 

The significance of each environmental aspect and 

impact is assessed using a risk assessment technique 

based on factors compromising the likelihood of 

occurrence, severity of impact and control measure 

to be implemented. 

CLCT strives to minimise impacts such as resource 

depletion, carbon emissions and waste generation. 

This is achieved by setting green building rating 

and 

environmental 

performance 

targets 

and 

implementing various measures to achieve them. 

The targets are linked to the remuneration for staff 

including top management.

Training and Awareness

To 

facilitate 

effective 

implementation 

of 

CapitaLand’s 

EHSMS, 

training 

and 

awareness 

programmes are conducted for all CLCT’s staff. In 

FY 2021, CLCT achieved a participation rate of 91% 

from the property management teams in China, 

who attended EHS-related training sessions. It is 

mandatory for new employees from the property 

management teams to be introduced to CapitaLand’s 

EHS policy and EHSMS.

Internal and External Audits 

As a CLI-sponsored REIT, CLCT taps on the internal 

audit system by CapitaLand to ensure that the 

implementation of its EMS is effective and aligned 

to the ISO 45001 standards. CapitaLand also ensures 

that external audits are conducted annually by 

an accredited third-party certification body. An 

annual audit of the EMS provides assurance to 

CLCT’s stakeholders on CLCT’s commitment to best 

practices.

Sustainable Building Guidelines

CLCT adheres to CapitaLand’s Sustainable Building 

Guidelines (SBG) guides for all its refurbishment 

works. The SBG is an in-house guide developed since 

2007 to ensure that environmental considerations are 

factored in at all stages of a project, from feasibility, 

design, procurement, construction, operation to 

redevelopment. The SBG is regularly reviewed to 

ensure continuous improvement, with four main 

objectives:

CAPITALAND’S ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH 

AND SAFETY (EHS) POLICY

As a CLI-sponsored REIT, CLCT 

is committed to protecting the 

environment 

and 

upholding 

the occupational health and 

safety (OHS) of everyone in the 

workplace, and will:

• Carry out exemplary EHS practices to minimise 

pollution and health and safety risks 

• Seek continual improvement on its EHS 

performance 

• Comply with pertinent legislations and other 

requirements 

• Implement 

the 

CapitaLand 

Sustainable 

Building Guidelines and Occupational Health 

and Safety programmes

This policy is readily available to all employees, 

tenants, suppliers, service providers and partners.

water usage, carbon emissions and waste generation 

via CapitaLand’s online Environmental Tracking 

System (ETS). Additionally, energy and paper 

consumption at CapitaLand’s corporate offices in 

Singapore and China are monitored with the ETS. 

The ETS is also used to survey the various initiatives 

implemented 

at 

CLCT’s 

properties, 

including 

efficiency measures, biodiversity and habitat risks, 

water management and flood risk.

The property management teams of CLCT assets 

submit monthly data and upload supporting 

documentation in the ETS. The consolidated data is 

analysed against reduction targets. This facilitates 

a better understanding of consumption patterns 

and identification of areas for eco-efficiency 

improvements.

 

Energy Consumption and Intensity

CLCT’s 

total 

energy 

consumption 

comprises 

direct energy consumption (fuel consumption for 

maintenance of diesel generator) and indirect energy 

consumption (purchase of electricity and heating). 

In FY 2021, CLCT’s total energy consumption 

increased by 21.3% Year-on-Year (YoY) to 85.2 GWh, 

with indirect energy consumption accounting for 

approximately 87.3% of the figure. This increase is 

attributed to the addition of five business parks to 

CLCT’s portfolio in 2021. 

CLCT recorded an energy consumption intensity 

of 5.5 kWh/m2/month in 2021, which translates to 

54.2% reduction in energy consumption intensity 

compared to the 2008 baseline.

CLCT is in the progress of exploring opportunities to 

generating electricity from renewable sources at its 

properties.

Carbon Emissions and Intensity

Similarly, due to the acquisition of five business park 

properties, CLCT’s total scope 1 and scope 2 carbon 

emissions1 in 2021 increased by 22.6% YoY to 40,697.7 

tonne CO2e. CLCT recorded a carbon emissions 

intensity of 2.5 kgCO2e/m2/month in 2021, which 

translates to a 61.4% reduction in carbon emissions 

intensity compared to the 2008 baseline. 

1. Minimise 

Carbon 

Footprint 

and 

Energy 

Consumption

2. Enhance Water Management

3. Minimise Waste Generation 

4. Promote Biodiversity 

A key component of the SBG is the mandatory 

Environment, Health and Safety Impact Assessment 

(EHS IA). The EHSIA is carried out prior to acquisitions, 

with significant findings and their cost implications, 

if any, incorporated in the investment paper 

submitted to the Board of Directors for approval. 

The 

Environmental 

Impact 

Assessment 

(EIA) 

focuses on identifying any environmental threats 

or opportunities related to the project site and 

its surroundings, covering matters such as floods, 

biodiversity, air quality, noise, connectivity, heritage 

and resources. 

With the implementation of this process, CLCT 

identifies risks and opportunities relating to 

Environment, 

Health 

and 

Safety 

and 

adopts 

mitigation measures at an early stage. CapitaLand 

is at the nascent stage of developing a new metric, 

Return on Sustainability (ROS) to quantify the risks 

and value-creation opportunities for each project.

Green Certification Targets

CLCT has commenced working plans to achieve green 

certifications for its portfolio by 2030. This is in line 

with CapitaLand’s target to green all its existing 

properties by 2030, with each property achieving a 

minimum certification level by a green rating system 

administered by a national government ministry/

agency or the World Green Building Council.

Green Lease

CapitaLand also aims to roll out its green lease 

programme (currently implemented at its Singapore 

properties) across its properties globally, including 

CLCT-managed assets, and work with its tenants to 

improve their sustainability performance.

glass roof of CapitaMall Nuohemule. 

These panels serve as a sunshade 

to reduce solar heat and radiation. 

Time sensors were also installed 

on the air conditioning systems, 

keeping operations to 10 hours daily instead of 

24/7, resulting in a 5% energy reduction since its 

installation. 

Similarly, CLCT installed sunscreens on the glass roof 

of CapitaMall Qibao from June to September 2021 

and observed an average temperature decrease of 

0.5˚C in summer.

Environmental

Water Consumption and Intensity

CLCT is committed to reducing total water 

consumption and overall water intensity across its 

portfolio. For CLCT properties, water is withdrawn 

from local municipal sources, and used in building 

systems such as irrigation and air-conditioning. 

Proper water management ensures minimal wastage 

and promotes responsible use of this precious 

resource; as part of CapitaLand’s Sustainability 

Master Plan 2030, these initiatives have been rolled 

out in CLCT’s retail malls and business parks: 

• Lowered flush volumes and water-efficient 

faucets 

• Replaced corroded fixtures 

• Installed automatic irrigation systems 

• Installed video surveillance and remote meters 

on water supply and air conditioning systems to 

monitor water consumption in real-time

Across all properties, the property management 

teams conduct regular checks across water features 

and monitor water usage closely such that any 

fluctuations or anomalies can be identified and 

acted upon promptly.

To increase awareness of water-saving initiatives, 

CLCT conducted quarterly operational meetings with 

tenants and employees in the year to reinforce the 

importance of water conservation and share water 

reduction measures. 

In FY 2021, CLCT’s total water consumption in 2021 

increased by 68.5% YoY to 0.9 million m3. This is due 

to the acquisition of the business parks and increase 

in water usage for cleaning and disinfection purposes 

amid the COVID-19 pandemic, to ensure the health 

and safety of staff and visitors to CLCT’s properties. 

In terms of intensity, CLCT recorded a water intensity 

of 0.057 m3/m2/month in 2021, which translates to 

38.5% reduction in water consumption intensity 

compared to the 2008 baseline.

Operational Waste 

CLCT aims to play its part by managing waste at its 

properties responsibly. As waste generated at its 

operational properties is mostly from its tenants, 

shoppers and the general public, CLCT engages its 

stakeholders through various means to reduce and 

recycle waste. Recycling and disposal bins for each 

type of waste (construction, food, hazardous and all 

other waste) are available at its properties.

In addition, main contractors are responsible for 

implementing 

proper 

procedures 

to 

minimise 

and dispose of construction waste. The waste 

collected and recycled are tracked by the property 

management teams of each property.

In FY 2021, a total of 8,400.3 tonnes of non-

hazardous waste was collected within CLCT, of which 

12.5% (equivalent to 1,046.9 tonnes) were recyclable 

waste comprising paper, plastic, metals and other 

materials. CLCT will continue to implement measures 

to reduce waste generation and increase recycling 

rate across its portfolio.

CLCT actively promotes the use of environmentally 

friendly practices such as returning used photocopier 

toner cartridges and using FSC certified paper (i.e., 

from sustainably managed forests, recycled and 

controlled sources) in its corporate office. As part 

of the drive to encourage sustainability practices, 

CLCT’s ISR is not printed and it is made available on 

its website.

Biodiversity

CLCT’s properties are all located within urban areas. 

As CLCT does not have any sites located within 

protected areas, no material biodiversity risks have 

been identified.

As a CLI-sponsored REIT, CLCT leverages on 

CapitaLand’s 

commitment 

to 

preserve 

the 

environmental integrity of its sites as well as the 

wider area wherever possible. This is achieved by 

addressing any distinctive ecological features, taking 

into consideration nature reserves, protecting plant 

and animal species and removing invasive plant 

species on or near the site. External experts are 

engaged to provide advice where appropriate.

Environmental

CLCT also collaborated with schools to cultivate 

environmental 

awareness 

in 

youth. 

Through 

performances and games, students learned about 

how their actions would affect the environment 

and the ways to minimise harmful impacts. 

Activities such as tree planting, community clean-

ups and environment-focused exhibitions were also 

organised for properties’ employees, tenants, and 

visitors.

In 2021, CLCT collaborated with the Beijing 

Aquarium to hold a “Save the Ocean” exhibition at 

CapitaMall Xizhimen. To promote the exhibition, 

an art competition was organised on 1 June 2021 

(Children’s Day). The event saw participation from 

over 30 children, with winners receiving entrance 

tickets to the exhibition and aquarium. Separately, 

30 families were invited for a painting activity within 

the exhibition to create awareness about protecting 

the marine environment and its creatures. Jellyfish 

and fish décor were hung from the second and third 

floors of the mall to promote appreciation for the 

different marine creatures.

culture for its stakeholders. For example, Industrial 

Park Safety Department conducted a safety training 

for CLCT’s resident contractors and long-term 

suppliers, covering electrical safety, fire safety, 

maintenance inspection, and property laws and 

regulations. A total of 40 contractors and 12 long-

term suppliers participated in this safety training in 

FY 2021.

Contractors are required to comply with strict 

safety regulations. It is mandatory to conduct safety 

briefings prior to any work commencement and all 

personnel involved must be equipped with proper 

personal protection equipment including safety 

boots, helmet and gloves. CLCT strictly enforces 

these regulations with regular inspections to ensure 

the health and safety of its stakeholders.

All employees of Ascendas Xinsu Portfolio undergo 

health and safety training annually, to ensure 

employees are equipped with the necessary skills 

to protect themselves. The theme for 2021 was 

defensive driving and civil defence safety training. 

Conducted in April, the defensive driving course was 

aimed at enhancing the driver’s skills through the 

introduction of techniques to minimise danger that 

might arise from other vehicles or road users. The 

civil defence safety training conducted in September 

was aimed at increasing employees’ knowledge 

on the steps to take during an emergency, such as 

an earthquake, and also to educate employees on 

general civil defence knowledge. In total, more than 

80% of employees attended the trainings. 

CLCT monitors the OHS performance of staff, 

including contract and part-time workers, who are 

involved in the daily operations and management of 

its properties. 

In 2021, there were two work-related injuries1 

involving CLCT’s staff, mostly from the operations 

team, which translates into an injury rate of 1.8 

(number of work-related injuries per million hours 

worked). In FY 2021, there were zero work-related 

fatalities, high consequence injuries and occupational 

diseases recorded. Thorough investigations were 

conducted where possible, and all necessary follow-

up actions have been taken. As part of its OHS 

Management System, CLCT will continue to monitor 

its OHS performance, reinforcing safety standards 

and fine-tuning its SOPs for further improvements.

 

HUMAN CAPITAL

Risk Management of OHS Hazards

CLCT values the occupational health and safety of 

our employees and stakeholders. Effective OHS 

management is part of risk management and has 

the potential to enhance staff productivity, morale 

and overall well-being. CLCT adopts CapitaLand’s 

Occupational Health and Safety Management 

System (OHSMS), which is accredited to the 

international ISO 45001 Standards. A key component 

of the OHSMS is to identify OHS hazards and assess 

their risks. CLCT strives to minimise and eliminate 

potential risks through the implementation of 

Hazards Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA). 

OHS hazards were identified to integrate mitigation 

measures to the functions of CLCT’s operations. 

Top Management Commitment and Staff 

Involvement 

CapitaLand champions OHS with commitment 

from the top management and staff participation 

through an integrated EHS Management System 

and stakeholder engagement activity. CLCT’s CEO 

is accountable for the OHS performance of CLCT. 

All staff are encouraged to take ownership of OHS 

issues and be proactive in reporting all OHS-related 

incidents, including non-compliances and non-

conformities.

CLCT incorporates OHS KPIs which are linked to 

the remuneration of CLCT’s staff, including top 

management.

Internal and External Audits

As a CLI-sponsored REIT, CLCT taps on the internal

Training and Awareness

To facilitate the effective implementation of its 

OHS Management System, training and awareness 

programmes are organised for CLCT’s staff, with 

topics that include safety and emergency response, 

fire-fighting and defensive driving.

Training sessions were also conducted for CLCT’s

Supply Chain Management 

CLCT works closely with its contractors and 

suppliers, who are committed to comply with high 

quality environmental, health and safety standards. 

Contractors are only appointed if it meets the Group’s 

stringent selection criteria. The Manager adopts the 

CapitaLand Procurement Policy, and the CapitaLand 

Supply Chain Code of Conduct to ensure responsible 

operations in the areas of anti-corruption, human 

rights, health and safety, as well as environmental 

management. A structured procurement process is 

implemented with contracts awarded after rigorous 

tender selection involving a balanced evaluation of 

financial and non-financial criteria including safety 

requirements.

All vendors are provided with a copy of CapitaLand’s 

EHS Policy and are required to ensure that their staff 

are sufficiently trained or briefed on environmental, 

health and safety measures. Vendors are required 

to submit a copy of their risk assessment and are 

required to comply with the local government and 

other legal requirements. Contractor house rules 

stipulate requirements that cover the deployment 

of personal protective equipment, reporting of 

accidents and the proper disposal of debris and toxic 

waste.

CLCT abides to CapitaLand’s Supply Chain Code of 

Conduct and aims to encourage suppliers to operate 

responsibly in the areas of anti-corruption, human 

rights, health and environmental management. 

To ensure compliance with CLCT’s EHS requirements, 

all tenants and suppliers are required to endorse the 

Occupational Health Notice. The Notice highlights 

potential hazards and shares control measures that 

can be implemented. Suppliers must also endorse 

the Safety Management Agreement, which outlines 

the organisation’s emergency response, safety and 

fire protection requirements.

CLCT conducted monthly evaluations, in the form 

of interviews, for key service providers such as 

security, cleaning, landscape maintenance, elevator 

maintenance and fire protection agencies to ensure 

consistent service quality. Factors such as safety 

control measures and equipment usage status were 

monitored and graded against a scoring system 

agreed in the contract.

Tenants are required to comply with fire rating 

requirements, and all decorative items must meet 

a minimal fire protection grade. CLCT conducts 

inspections during the installation process and will 

halt any works until any non-compliance is rectified.

Human Rights 

As a CLI-sponsored REIT, CLCT adopts CapitaLand’s 

integrated human capital strategy to recruit, develop 

and motivate staff. Key performance indicators 

(KPI), both for the business as well as for people 

development, are in place to ensure that staff’s 

performance goals are aligned with the Group’s 

business objectives. Staff are provided with the 

appropriate development opportunities to perform 

well in their jobs.

CapitaLand has a Social Charter which sets out 

commitments to support the preservation of human 

dignity and self-respect of every individual, covering 

topics on human rights, child labour, forced labour, 

human trafficking, code of conduct, diversity and 

inclusion, and healthy work-life balance. As a CLI-

sponsored REIT, this policy is also applicable for 

all CLCT’s staff. The policy guides CLCT towards 

ensuring a supportive and respectful environment 

for individuals across all aspects of CLCT’s business 

and operations.

Anti-Child Labour and Anti-Forced Labour

CapitaLand is a signatory of the United Nations 

Global Compact (UNGC) and is committed to the 

10 principles in the areas of human rights, labour, 

environment and anti-corruption. These 10 Principles 

of the UNGC are derived from the Universal 

Declaration of Human Rights, the International 

Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental 

Principles and Rights at Work, the Rio Declaration 

on Environment and Development, and the United 

Nations Convention against Corruption.

In 2021, CLCT had no reported incident relating to 

discrimination, child labour or forced labour, and no 

staff was below the age of 16.

Gender Diversity and Pay Parity 

CLCT’s workforce in Singapore and China comprises 

of 57.6% male employees and 42.4% female 

employees, with close to 50% of female managerial 

staff represented at the middle and senior 

management levels.

CLCT rewards male and female employees fairly based 

on merit, ability, and experience for comparable 

roles across the organisation’s hierarchy. CLCT

entitled to the same benefits on a pro-rata basis. Its 

robust performance management system ensures 

that all staff receive regular performance and career 

development reviews.

All CLCT’s staff are entitled to parental leave. In FY 

2021, 12 eligible female staff went on maternity 

leave and five1 returned to work in the same period. 

CLCT also provides paid paternity leave to all male 

staff, where practicable with no male staff taking 

paternity leave in 2021. In FY 2021, 11 out of 12 

female staff who took maternity leave continued 

to work in CLCT 12 months after they returned from 

maternity leave.

Fair Remuneration 

All CLCT staff have signed employment contracts with 

the key employment terms and conditions clearly 

stipulated. This allows our staff to understand both 

their rights and obligations, as well as those of the 

REIT, thus minimising potential employment disputes. 

Key employment terms specified in the employment 

contract include the job title and description, 

duration of employment, working hours, salary and 

allowances, (statutory) contributions/deductions, 

leave entitlements, probation and notice periods, 

and key insurance and medical benefits etc.

To ensure that CLCT remains competitive and 

continues to attract and retain the best talent, 

CLCT taps on external independent remuneration 

consultants engaged by CapitaLand to benchmark 

the REIT’s compensation packages against the 

relevant talent markets. Salaries are reviewed 

against the benchmarks and the specific job 

scope and responsibilities of each staff is taken 

into consideration. All regular full-time staff will 

undergo an annual performance review where an 

open discussion on the staff’s performance, areas 

for improvement, developmental needs and career 

plans are covered.

independent remuneration consultants.

Diversity and Inclusion 

As an international company, CapitaLand embraces 

diversity and inclusivity regardless of age, religion, 

gender, race, nationality and family status. CLCT 

believes that our staff can make significant 

contributions based on their talent, expertise and 

experience. As a CLI-sponsored REIT, CLCT also adopts 

a localisation strategy for its overseas operations, 

where reasonable and practicable. This ensures that 

the teams on the ground have a good grasp of the 

local socio-political and cultural sensitivities to help 

deliver on the REIT’s business outcomes. 

Job Creation and Employment

CLCT is committed to talent mobility, where staff are 

given opportunities to rotate across different job 

functions, subject to skills/competency requirements 

and business needs. CLCT also adopts CapitaLand’s 

re-employment policy of extending employment to 

staff who have reached the mandatory retirement 

age but are still able and willing to continue 

contributing to CapitaLand. 

Respect for Freedom of Association 

CapitaLand respects its staff’s right to freedom of 

association and to be members of trade unions. In 

Singapore, CapitaLand is guided by the Industrial 

Relations Act that allows the representation of 

staff by trade unions for collective bargaining, thus 

providing them with an avenue to seek redress for any 

industrial disputes. CapitaLand and the unions enjoy 

a cordial working relationship, promoting positive 

working conditions and improving productivity for 

the mutual benefit of CLCT and its employees.

Positive Work Environment

CLCT recognises that a positive work environment 

is essential to attract, motivate and retain talent. 

It leverages on CapitaLand’s overall well-being 

programme that promotes personal development, 

health and work-life harmony. Initiatives of the 

programme includes a range of medical and benefits 

plans, flexible work arrangements, staff engagement 

initiatives and subsidised rates for staff staying at

Staff Engagement

CLCT attaches great importance to employee 

communication. CLCT actively engages its staff 

through 

various 

avenues, 

including 

regular 

communication sessions held by senior management 

for effective flow of information and alignment of 

business goals and objectives across all levels of the 

workforce. Quarterly staff communication sessions 

by CapitaLand’s CEO allow the Group’s senior 

management team to communicate and interact 

with staff. These sessions are broadcast live to 

CapitaLand offices globally.

Following the successful restructuring of CapitaLand 

into CapitaLand Investment Limited (CLI) and 

CapitaLand Development Pte. Ltd. (CLD), CLCT’s 

employees were invited to participate in a Pulse 

Survey conducted by CapitaLand in November 

and December 2021 to gather their feedback 

and to understand the ground sentiments on the 

restructuring.

SUPPORTING EMPLOYEE WELL-BEING: LAUNCHING OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE GUIDE

CapitaLand introduced its very own Mental Health Care Guide, which aims to equip 

employees with information on the different aspects of mental health. Employees can 

check out upcoming events, learn how to improve mental wellness, and even play a game 

to discover their mental age. The site also lists an internal network of Mental Wellness 

Ambassadors (MWAs) and contact details of external agencies employees can approach 

for support. 

To commemorate World Mental Health Day 2021 (10 October 2021), employees including CLCT’s staff are 

encouraged to spend 5 minutes (‘TAKE 5’) learning more about mental health or practising small acts of 

self-care. Employees could access the various talks lined up by community providers and learn how to 

prioritise their routine and activities to improve their mental health.

Talent Management 

CLCT seeks innovative, dynamic and talented staff 

to take the REIT into its next phase of growth, 

adopting a multi-pronged approach to manpower 

planning, i.e., developing internal talent and hiring 

young talent, mid-career professionals and industry 

veterans. CLCT continuously builds its management 

bench strength through the identification of high 

potential talent as part of its regular leadership 

development and succession planning process.

In 2021, 105 staff were hired, consisting of 50.5% 

male and 49.5% female employees. 37.1% of the new 

hires were below 30 years old, 61.9% were between 

30 to 50 years old and 1.0% were above 50 years 

old. All staff receive regular performance and career 

development reviews, and CLCT closely monitors 

its staff’s progress to guide them in performance 

improvement.

CLCT rides on CapitaLand’s initiatives to ensure that 

all staff understand CapitaLand’s core values and 

principles that shape the way we work and function. 

To facilitate employees’ development, a variety 

and comprehensive training and development 

programmes at multiple levels are organised for 

CLCT’s staff; these include joint training programmes 

with training providers such as NTUC Learning Hub. 

In FY 2021, 100% of Singapore’s and 99% of China’s 

staff attended at least one learning event, and the 

average training hours completed by each employee 

was 103.4 hours. Moving forward, CLCT will work 

towards ensuring more staff achieve the target. 

To encourage employee development, all CLCT’s 

employees receive regular performance and career 

development reviews. To make it convenient for 

employees to obtain learning resources, CapitaLand 

also launched its own online learning platform. With 

the launch of CapitaLand i-learning portal, CLCT’s 

employees can access different types of courses and 

can freely arrange their time to learn and improve 

their business capabilities.

CLCT’s investor relations (IR) policy, which is available 

on its website at www.clct.com.sg, provides the 

framework to execute its communications activities 

effectively.

Its key objectives are firstly, to ensure stakeholders 

are equipped with accurate and timely information 

to make sound judgements about the REIT; 

and secondly, to cultivate trust and confidence 

through regular and clear communication with its 

stakeholders. CLCT strives to disclose information 

that pertains not only to its financials and operations 

but also to its environmental, social and governance 

(ESG) matters, which has increasingly become a 

deciding factor for many investment mandates. This 

engagement is managed via multiple touchpoints, 

including one-on-one meetings, website, investor 

roadshows and participation in industry conferences 

and forums.

All material information is announced in a timely 

manner on SGXNet and on CLCT’s corporate website, 

including 

financial 

results, 

business 

updates, 

annual reports as well as presentation decks used 

at conferences and roadshows. Investors may also 

sign up for email alerts to receive timely updates on 

CLCT’s latest announcements and press releases. A 

dedicated “Ask Us” email address (ask-us@clct.com.

and the general public. CLCT organised various 

events, and participates in conferences throughout 

the year, providing opportunities for the investment 

community and the media to interact with the senior 

management team and learn more about the REIT’s 

operations.

Tenant Satisfaction Survey

CLCT strives to create meaningful relationships with 

its customers. To maintain the relevance of its malls, 

the REIT conducted a tenant satisfaction survey 

at 10 of its retail malls in FY 2021, with an overall 

participation rate of 100.0%. CLCT garnered feedback 

on a range of matters from cleanliness, security, 

mall ambience to the adequacy of car park lots. On 

an average, 97.1% of the respondents expressed 

satisfaction with CLCT’s services, an improvement 

from 94.0% attained in the previous year. The 

survey is useful in providing specific and actionable 

feedback, which allows us to better address our 

tenants’ needs and concerns. The feedback obtained 

is reviewed and relevant follow up actions are taken 

to improve the experience and service levels to its 

tenants and shoppers.

Supply Chain

CLCT works with contractors and suppliers that 

are committed to high quality EHS standards. For 

building operations, CLCT adopts CapitaLand’s 

contractor management guidelines which require 

all contractors to comply with local government and 

other legal requirements. Preference is given to ISO 

14001 and ISO 45001 certified companies. In line with 

CapitaLand’s global commitment to human rights, 

it is mandatory for main contractors appointed by 

CLCT to ensure that there is no child labour and/or 

forced labour engaged.

CLCT is guided by CapitaLand Supply Chain Code of 

Conduct that aims to influence its supply chain to 

operate responsibly in the areas of anti-corruption, 

human rights, health and safety, as well as 

environmental management. For more information, 

please refer to the Supply Chain Management 

segment in the Human Capital chapter.

Community Government Agencies and Regulators 

CLCT is committed to adhere to regulatory compliance. 

Procedures adopted at CLI are in place to ensure that 

CLCT’s activities and operations correspondingly 

comply with existing regulatory requirements. This 

is done through regular monitoring and evaluation 

and audit of the CapitaLand EHSMS. For more details, 

please refer to the Environmental Capital chapter.

 

Community/ NGOs 

CLCT organises activities that are aligned with its 

focus on community investment, raising awareness 

and stakeholder engagement in the areas of 

philanthropy, environment, health and safety. In 

China, members of the public and tenants can sign 

up for these events at CLCT’s retail malls and business 

parks. The social capital generated in these focus 

areas support CLCT’s business growth.

Risk-Aware Culture

ORGANISATIONAL CAPITAL 

The Board of Directors (Board) has adopted the Board 

Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that establishes 

the requirements for every Director in CLCT to adhere 

and comply with the highest standards of ethical 

conduct. This sets the appropriate tone from the top 

in respect of the desired organisational culture and 

ensures proper accountability within CLCT. In line 

with this, the Board has a standing policy requiring 

each Director to not allow himself/herself to get into 

a situation where there is a conflict between his/her 

duty to the CLCT and his/her own interests.

Fraud, Bribery and Corruption (FBC) Risk 

Management Framework

As a CLI-sponsored REIT, CLCT adopts a zero-

tolerance stance against any FBC in the conduct of 

its business activities and expects all its employees to 

be committed to the highest standards of integrity 

in their work and business dealings.

The FBC Risk Management framework has been 

set in place to manage FBC risks in an integrated, 

systematic and consistent manner.

Together with various CapitaLand’s policies and 

procedures, the FBC Risk Management Policy is 

published on the intranet and accessible by all CLCT’s 

staff. The policies aim to help detect and prevent FBC 

by:

• offering a fair compensation package to staff, 

based on practices of pay-for-performance and 

promotion based on merit; and providing various 

healthcare subsidies and financial assistance 

schemes to alleviate the common financial 

pressures faced by its staff. 

• documenting policies and work procedures 

which incorporate internal controls to ensure 

that adequate checks and balances are in place. 

Periodic audits are also conducted to evaluate the 

efficacy of these internal controls. 

• building and maintaining the right organisational 

culture through its core values, educating its staff 

on business conduct and ethical values.

In addition, these various policies and guidelines call 

upon CLCT’s staff to observe ethical principles in the 

conduct of business activities which include:

• Abiding by CapitaLand’s Ethics and Code of 

Business Conduct Policies which deal with 

matters such as confidentiality, conduct and work 

discipline, corporate gifts and concessionary 

offers. Clear policies and guidelines on how to 

handle workplace harassment, grievances are 

also in place. Donations are not to be made to 

any political causes through CapitaLand and/or its 

philanthropic arm, CapitaLand Hope Foundation.

• Acting professionally and with integrity; 

• Practising fair competition; 

• Honouring contractual commitments made; 

• Not making inaccurate or misleading statements; 

• Making decisions or representations only when 

duly authorised; 

• Ensuring appropriateness of frequency and venue 

when conducting business activities; 

• Maintaining security and confidentiality of data 

and information; and 

• Not manipulating business relationships for 

personal gains or interests.

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 

Risk management is an integral part of CLCT’s 

business – both operationally and strategically. 

Adopting CapitaLand’s Enterprise Risk Management 

(ERM) 

Framework 

enables 

CLCT 

to 

identify, 

manage, monitor and report material risks in an 

integrated, systematic and consistent manner. The 

Board is responsible for the governance of risks 

across CLCT, assisted by the Audit Committee, who 

provides dedicated oversight of risk management 

at the Board’s level. The Board approves CLCT’s risk 

appetite, which determines the nature and extent of 

material risks that the Manager is willing to take to 

achieve CLCT’s strategic and business objectives.

For more information regarding Risk Management, 

please refer to the CLCT Annual Report 2021 page 

70 to 76.

A whistle-blowing policy and other procedures 

are in place to provide the CapitaLand’s staff and 

external parties who have dealings with the Group, 

with a well-defined, accessible and trusted channel 

to report suspected FBC, dishonest practices or 

other improprieties in the workplace. Procedures 

are put in place to provide such employees and 

parties with well defined, accessible and trusted 

channels to report suspected fraud, corruption, 

dishonest practices or other improprieties in the 

workplace, and for the independent investigation 

of any reported incidents and appropriate follow 

up action. The whistle-blower is given the option to 

make such reports anonymously, and the Manager 

ensures that the identity of the whistle-blower is 

kept confidential regardless. The objective of this 

policy is to encourage the reporting of such matters 

so that employees or external parties making any 

reports in good faith will be able to do so with the 

confidence that they will be treated fairly and, to the 

extent possible, be protected from reprisal.

Substantiated cases are reported quarterly to the 

CapitaLand Audit Committee and shared with 

the risk champions regularly. Actions taken can 

include the termination of staff’s contract, and/or 

reporting to the appropriate external authorities. 

In FY 2021, there were no substantiated cases of 

FBC, and cases involving anti-competition or money 

laundering behaviour within CLCT. More details on 

CLCT’s practices can be found on page 36 to 69 of 

the Corporate Governance Report in CLCT’s Annual 

Report 2021. 

Training 

Training and development are crucial to ensure 

all employees understand the CapitaLand’s core 

values and principles that share the way the Group 

works and functions. There are dedicated training 

courses in Singapore and China such as “CapitaDNA: 

Strengthening Core Values”, where specific examples 

and applications of the Company’s core values in the 

workplace are shared.

TCFD RECOMMENDATIONS 

CLCT’s climate-related disclosures in line with the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)

CLI had started to align its climate related disclosures with TCFD recommendations in the four key areas of 

governance, strategy, risk management and metric and targets since 2017 and further declared its support 

for TCFD and its recommendations in 2019. 

CLI and its REITs, including CLCT, will be enhancing their TCFD reporting and will continue enhancing their 

implementation of TCFD recommendations.

Governance

The Board of the Manager of CLCT (the Board) considers sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation, 

determines the material ESG factors and oversees the management and monitoring of the material ESG factors. 

The Board sets the REIT’s risk appetite, which determines the nature and extent of material risks that CLCT 

is willing to take to achieve their strategic and business objective. As part of the material risk issues being 

highlighted, climate change has been identified as critical. The Board regularly reviews climate change risks as 

part of the CLI Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework.

The Board is actively involved in discussions on environment-related initiatives, which include climate-related 

initiatives. Taking the lead from CLI, the Board is updated on relevant performance metrics, e.g. carbon emissions 

performance and progress on the reduction targets and green certification. They are also kept aware of any 

environmental incidents, which may include climate-related damages or disruptions.

At the REIT level, CLCT works closely with CapitaLand China’s EHS Committee. This EHS committee drives initiatives 

related to climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as the broader environmental issues. CLCT is looking 

to set up a specialised sustainability committee, led/chaired by its CEO. In alignment with CLI, the CLCT CEO is 

responsible for CLCT’s climate change-related targets. A key objective of CLCT’s senior management is to transit 

to a low-carbon business that is aligned with climate science and build a resilient and resource efficient portfolio. 

Members of CLCT’s senior management and relevant stakeholders will undergo annual training to further build 

capacity with respect to climate-related risk and opportunity management. The frequency and content of these 

capacity building trainings will be regularly reviewed to incorporate emerging issues relating to environmental 

risk management

In line with the Group governance, in 2021, CLI Group-wide sustainability management comes under the purview 

of CapitaLand Sustainability Council (SC) which comprises two Independent Board members and four executive 

committee members that report to the CLI Board. CapitaLand’s Management Council consisting of the Group 

Chief Executive Officer (CEO), all Presidents and/or CEOs of business units and key management officers of the 

Corporate Office provide strategic management of ESG implementation across the Group. It is supported by the 

Group Sustainability Office and various work teams to drive continued progress and improvement in the areas of 

ESG. It was chaired by one of CapitaLand Investment Board’s independent directors and member of its Executive 

Resource and Compensation Committee and Risk Committee. The work teams comprise representatives from CLI 

business units and corporate functions. This governance is cascaded from the Group level to CLCT level through 

the operations of CLCT’s EHS Committee.

Strategy

As a CLI-sponsored REIT, CLI’s identified ESG issues have been deemed to be material and applicable to CLCT’s 

business and operations. The selection of these issues will be guided by CLI’s regular review, assessment and 

feedback process in relation to ESG topics moving forward.

Climate change and emissions reduction is one of the key ESG material issues identified as relevant and critical 

for CLI and CLCT. Climate change risk has been identified as a key risk as part of its ERM Framework and includes 

both physical and transitional risks. Physical risks include consideration of rising sea levels, violent storms, long 

intense heat waves, flash floods and freshwater depletion. Transitional risks include potentially more stringent 

regulations and increased expectations from customers and stakeholders. 

In line with the Group, the REIT’s strategy to identify and address climate-related risks and opportunities spans 

all areas of its real estate life cycle, from the earliest stage of the investment process, to design, procurement, 

construction, operations and redevelopment or divestment.

• All new investments into operational assets and development projects undergo the EHS Impact Assessment 

during due diligence to identify any environmental (including climate change) risks and opportunities related 

to the asset/project site and its surroundings. The assessment covers performance metrics such as energy 

efficiency, as well as transitional and physical risk and opportunity considerations. Significant findings from 

the assessment would be incorporated in the investment paper submitted to CLCT’s Board for approval.

• Through the implementation of the Group’s Sustainable Building Guidelines (SBG), it aims to identify and 

address the risks and opportunities of climate change right from the design stage. The local context of each 

project will be studied in detail, and appropriate measures will be taken into consideration with regards to 

adaptation of climate change. SBG also sets guidelines for buildings to be more energy efficient, e.g. setting 

green rating targets, specifying minimum equipment efficiency, and requiring the use of onsite renewable 

energy whenever possible.

• At the operational asset level, the Group’s Environment, Health and Safety Management System (EHSMS), 

which is audited by a third-party accredited certification body to ISO 14001 standard, serves to monitor 

transition risks relating to climate regulations via EHS legal registers updates and regular stakeholder 

engagement. Operational issues pertaining to climate change, energy and water are also identified and 

managed through the EHSMS to strengthen the climate resilience of its portfolio.

• The Group’s 2030 Sustainability Master Plan further outlines the targets and pathways for transition to a low-

carbon business that is aligned with climate science. Energy use and carbon reduction targets, as well as green 

certification targets are set for its operational assets. Initiatives are put in place to improve the environmental 

performance, resilience and durability of its assets through system upgrades, system optimization, effective 

maintenance and changes to user behaviour. The continued achievement of high green building ratings as 

well as energy and water efficiency measures put in place to achieve the reduction targets would help to 

mitigate the impact of changing weather conditions.

As part of the 2030 Sustainability Master Plan formulation, the REIT generally considers medium term time 

frames to be until 2030, and long term beyond 2030 in relation to the identification of climate-related risks and 

opportunities

CLI piloted various physical risk platforms with sample global assets (including some CLCT assets), to prepare for 

its group-wide scenario analysis study. CLI and its REITs aim to conduct its climate scenario analysis in 2022 for 

its global portfolio, including CLCT’s assets. This analysis would consider scenarios based on the latest global 

and scientific developments, and likely cover a spectrum of scenarios from 1.5˚C to 4˚C scenarios for current to 

long-term time frames, to draw conclusions on the financially material physical and transition risks and validate 

its current strategy. It will then review its mitigation and adaptation plans, identify opportunities, in alignment 

with CapitaLand’s 2030 Sustainability Master Plan, which is designed to build resilience throughout its operations 

and future-proof the Group’s real estate portfolio to guard against climate change risks and to avoid premature 

obsolescence and adopt available opportunities.

Risk Management

CLCT conducts an annual Trust-wide Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) exercise that requires business units 

and corporate functions to identify, assess and document material risk which includes ESG relevant risks, along 

with their key controls and mitigating measures. Material risks and their associated controls are consolidated 

and reviewed at the REIT level before they are presented to the REIT’s Audit and Risk Committee and the REIT’s 

Board. This exercise is based on CLI’s annual Group-wide RCSA exercise, review of the Risk Appetite Statement 

and Key Risk Indicator on Climate Change and Environmental Risk. Such climate-related risks and opportunities 

are identified and mitigated through CLI’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, and its externally 

certified ISO 14001 Environmental Management System (EMS).

CLCT’s risk management process to address its key risks and uncertainties, including climate change, is discussed 

further in its Annual Report, Risk Management on page 70.

Upon completion of the scenario assessment study, targeted in 2022, the CLI Group and the REIT will review and 

update, if appropriate, the processes associated with risk management in order to account for environmental 

and climate-related risks.

Climate-related risks and opportunities are identified and mitigated through CLI’s ERM Framework. The REIT 

prioritises material ESG issues based on the likelihood and potential impact of the issues affecting business 

continuity and development. Notably, CLCT is cognizant of the risk posed by existing and emerging regulatory 

requirements with relation to climate change as it is outlined in CLI’s ERM Framework as a transitional climate 

change risk. Some of these risks include:

• Regulatory or compliance risk, prompted by certain regulations in the countries of operation. These include 

but are not limited to the Environmental Risk Management Guidelines introduced by the Monetary Authority 

of Singapore (MAS) in 2020 requiring financial institutions and asset managers to place greater emphasis 

on both physical and transitional environmental risks and the Singapore Stock Exchange mandate from 

December 2021 that all issuers must provide climate reporting that is aligned to the recommendations of the 

Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures on a ‘comply or explain’ basis in their sustainability reports 

from the financial year (FY) commencing 2022. Climate reporting will be mandatory for the materials and 

buildings industry from FY 2024.

• Market risks, including shifts in carbon and electricity prices, or customer expectations, prompted by the 

conclusions of COP26 in November 2021, where it was recognised that urgent action is needed to combat 

global warming, and this can only be done through global action from governments and businesses. Other 

developments, such as China’s aim to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 while increasing the share of non-

fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to approximately 25%, are also monitored by CLCT as they affect 

the day-to-day operations and practices of the REIT.

Physical risks are observed through the regular monitoring of climate-related physical risks occurring as extreme 

weather events, for example cases of floods, and changing climate patterns are regularly monitored across 

the portfolio. In 2020, CLI had conducted a global portfolio baseline study to better understand its portfolio’s 

physical climate risk in relation to floods. This included insights into whether the properties were located in low 

lying plains, encountered flooding in previous years, had equipment located in the basement, etc. Globally, most 

of CLI’s properties already have flood control features/measures in place, such as flood barriers, sensors, water 

level pumps and flood emergency response plans. 

Through CLI’s ERM Framework and the implementation of the EHS IA for all new investments, it identifies and 

prioritise certain physical risks, e.g. floods are highlighted in the due diligence reports and plans to integrate 

climate change resilience and adaptation considerations into the design, development and management of its 

properties are identified. To further strengthen climate resilience to flood risk, CLI will regularly engage its 

business units to ensure flood emergency response plans are implemented across its portfolio.

Metrics and Targets

At the Group level, CLI has tracked and reduced the carbon emissions of its managed and owned operational 

properties, including those of CLCT, via its cloud-based Environmental Tracking System. All related metrics have 

been regularly disclosed in its annual Global Sustainability Report. Since 2010, CapitaLand has been disclosing 

scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions of its global portfolio and the data has been externally assured. 

Furthermore, in 2020, the Group had their carbon emissions reduction targets approved by the Science Based 

Targets initiative (SBTi) for a Well-below 2˚C scenario. This target is in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement 

to keep global temperature rise well below 2˚C in this century. In 2022, the Group would be evaluating the 

targets and the progress towards them and explore options for any long-term targets of decarbonisation. Please 

refer to the CLI Investment Global Sustainability Report 2021 which will be published by May 2022.

At the REIT level, in FY 2021, Direct Scope 1 carbon emissions amounted to 1,997 tonnes CO2e. Indirect Scope 

2 carbon emissions amounted to 38,700 tonnes CO2e for FY 2021. Overall carbon intensity (tCO2e/m2) for Direct 

Scope 1 and Indirect Scope 2 carbon emissions was reduced by 61.4% from the 2008 baseline. To calculate its 

carbon emissions, CLCT takes guidance from the operational control approach as defined by the GHG Protocol 

Corporate Standard, in line with the Group. 

Aligned with the Group, CLCT has set sustainability and climate related performance metrics and targets that 

are linked to the remuneration policies for members of senior management, such as the Balance Scorecard (BSC) 

framework for FY 2021 which had included both quantitative and qualitative targets relating to climate change. 

CLI also implemented a shadow internal carbon price in 2021 to quantify climate-related risk and opportunities 

for its new investments. It is also developing a new metric, Return on Sustainability, in addition to the regular 

financial return to measure the Group’s ESG impact. CLI will continue to explore new metrics to measure climate-

related risks and opportunities.
