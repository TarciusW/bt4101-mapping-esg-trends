Sustainability Governance 

We believe that strong leadership and an effective governance framework are essential to the 

successful integration of sustainability into our business operations. At ASA, a robust governance 

structure and various procedures are in place to manage environmental, social and governance (ESG) 

issues that are important to us and our stakeholders. 

 

Sustainability Steering Committee (SSC) 

The Sustainability Steering Committee (SSC) consists of senior members of the Administration, 

Finance, Human Resources, Information Technology and Engineering and Operations divisions at ASA. 

The SSC offers advice and assistance to the Board in ensuring that sustainability policies and 

procedures are aligned with ASA’s business strategy. A Sustainability Task Force (STF), represented by 

employees from Microfits Pte Ltd, has been established to support the SSC in implementing 

sustainability initiatives and programmes across ASA. 

 

Monitoring and Benchmarking 

Our sustainability performance is monitored and assessed against our peer companies in order to 

improve our own performance and to identify improvement areas. We carry out a review of our 

approach to sustainability once performance gaps have been identified, therefore allowing us to take 

targeted actions to address the gaps.  


                                                                                                                          Sustainability Report FY2017

Assessing Materiality 

Our stakeholders play a significant role in our success and we value their contributions to ASA. We 

meet and communicate with our stakeholders regularly to give them an update on our sustainability 

progress and to find out and respond to the material issues that concern them. The following table 

presents our approach to stakeholder engagement, which includes information on our key 

stakeholders and ways we engage with them:  

 

 

When assessing materiality, we considered the issues of concern to our various stakeholders as well 

as determining their importance to the operations of the business. We engaged an independent 

consultant to assist us in carrying out a materiality assessment in FY2017. The assessment involved 

members of the senior management team from ASA and took into account research conducted on 

global and local trends in our industry, material topics identified by our peers and industry best 

practices.   

 

We are committed to managing, measuring and reporting on issues that are material to us and our 

stakeholders. In FY2017, we focused on the following material issues:

Economic Performance 

 

Our economic performance affects our ability to deliver value to all stakeholders, including our 

shareholders. We strive to produce strong performance in order to create sustained value for our 

shareholders.  

 

Our financial performance for FY2017 can be found in the Financial Highlights section (page 9) and 

Appendix 2 - Audited Financial Statements (pages 7 to 52) of the Annual Report.

Environment 

Energy and Emissions  

 

 

Energy consumption accounts for a substantial amount of operating costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) 

emissions in the equipment manufacturing industry. The ongoing challenge of managing the impacts 

of rising energy costs and climate risks poses a threat to the industry. Reducing energy consumption 

and GHG emissions is, therefore, key to improving efficiency and supporting the transition to a low 

carbon and sustainable future. 

 

As an equipment manufacturer, ASA recognises its responsibility to reduce the environmental impacts 

of its business operations. We are committed to minimising our environmental footprint through 

sustainable practices and initiatives that aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while 

improving our energy efficiency and lowering costs.  

 

Cleanroom heating, ventilation, and air conditioning account for a significant amount of the total 

energy used at ASA. Therefore, we strive to reduce our energy consumption through more efficient 

use of our resources to achieve cost savings while implementing robust systems for monitoring and 

targeting. We track and monitor our utility consumption patterns on a monthly basis in order to 

ensure that our operations are as energy efficient as possible.  

 

The following initiatives have been implemented to reduce energy consumption:  

• 

Install an auto-timer in the air-compressor room at the manufacturing site 

• 

Conduct regular maintenance checks on equipment, including air compressors to ensure 

optimal performance 

• 

Maintain the air-conditioning within our office at a temperature of 24oC 

• 

Encourage employees to turn off lights and air-conditioners when not in use 

 

The total electricity consumption at ASA in FY2017 was 242,011 kilowatt hours (kWh), a rise of 1.1% 

compared to 239,371 kWh in FY2016. The electricity intensity increased slightly from 61 kWh/m2 in 

FY2016 to 62 kWh/m2 in FY2017. The rise is due to higher sales of manufacturing equipment. 

However, the GHG emissions from electricity use remained the same at 1,011 tonnes carbon dioxide 

equivalent (tCO2e) between FY2016 and FY2017. Similarly, the GHG emissions intensity from 

electricity use in FY2017 was unchanged from the previous year at 0.03 tCO2e/m2. 

 

1 CO2 emissions released were calculated using conversion factors of 0.4192 kg CO2/kWh and 0.4237 kg 

CO2/kWh – Singapore’s Average Operating Margin (OM) Grid Emission Factors (GEFs) in 2017 and 2016, 

respectively.

Waste 

 

 

Waste is an unavoidable aspect of any manufacturing process. We consider waste management a key 

issue mainly because our stakeholders and the communities have a great interest on how we manage 

waste generated from our business operations. Improper waste disposal can cause pollution, posing a 

threat to the environment and to human health. 

 

We advocate environmental responsibility by setting in place an ISO14001-certified environmental 

management system to manage hazardous and non-hazardous waste. We have implemented 

measures to monitor the life cycle of raw materials and ensure any waste generated is properly 

managed through incineration, landfill or other disposal methods that adhere to local rules and 

regulations, such as the Environmental Public Health (Toxic Industrial Waste) Regulations 1988 in 

Singapore. In FY2017, there were zero incidents of non-compliance with laws and regulations 

concerning waste management/disposal reported. 

 

A total of 168 tonnes of non-hazardous waste generated was incinerated at an off-site waste 

management facility during the same period.  

 

All general waste and toxic industrial waste are segregated and disposed of accordingly. We strive to 

recycle and possibly reuse most of the general waste generated. Burning of waste is strictly prohibited 

within our premises. We collect and store all waste oils in secure, clearly labelled drums, which are 

placed in designated areas to prevent any leaks or spills. We also engage licensed third party 

contractors to collect solid waste and waste oils for treatment and disposal.

Our People 

Talent Attraction and Retention  

 

At ASA, we recognise that our success depends on the quality, skills and expertise of our employees. 

The contributions of our employees play an important role in ensuring that we remain highly 

competitive in the equipment manufacturing industry. Thus, recruiting and retaining talent remains 

one of our top priorities.  

 

As of 31 December 2017, there were 33 employees at Microfits and most of them were based in 

Singapore. 45% of ASA’s employees were within the 30-to-50-year age group. There were no new 

hires and no turnover of employees at Microfits in FY2017.  

 

We have a system in place to collect, track and monitor our human resources (HR) data, including 

overtime, vacation balances and the number of training days.  

 

 

 

We offer competitive compensation and attractive employee benefits to attract and retain the best 

talent in order to grow the Group’s business. We have established a remuneration framework to align 

our pay practices with the marketplace. All our employees receive an annual performance review in 

which their performance is evaluated and personal development opportunities are identified.  

 

Our full-time employees enjoy benefits such as health care coverage, parental leave and retirement 

plans. Sufficient benefit coverage is also provided to our part-time employees. We conduct exit 

interviews to gain an understanding of the reasons why employees leave the Group. Feedback and 

comments are gathered from employees through the interviews.

Training and Education 

 

At ASA, we strive to provide our employees with opportunities to develop their potential through 

various learning and development programmes.  Employees are encouraged to participate in relevant 

workshops, seminars and courses to improve their skills and capabilities.  

 

All new employees are given on-the-job training under the supervision of experienced employees. We 

monitor the training needs and progress of our employees on a regular basis so that they can plan 

their professional development accordingly.   

 

Occupational Health and Safety 

 

At ASA, we consider health and safety as a priority and see this as integral to what we do. We believe 

it is our responsibility to provide a healthy and safe working environment to our employees and to 

ensure that health and safety risks are adequately addressed. 

 

A workplace health and safety committee has been established to facilitate employee participation in 

health and safety activities and to address health and safety issues throughout the Group. The 

committee, made up of management and employee representatives, meets regularly and makes 

recommendations to improve health, safety and working conditions at ASA. Also, processes are in 

place to measure and monitor our occupational health and safety performance.  

 

We adopt safe work practices, such as implementing standard operating procedures and carrying out 

emergency response training to ensure that the risk of accidents, injuries and exposure to health 

hazards for all of our employees and contractors is minimised. Our safety handbook outlines standard 

safety practices and requirements that our employees and contractors have to adhere to. Appropriate 

health and safety training is provided to our employees to ensure that they are able to identify and 

deal with common hazards in the workplace.  

 

Site inspections are conducted regularly to ensure that machines, equipment and work areas within 

our premises do not pose any risks to employee health and safety. Also, the conditions of the work 

environment and other relevant work practices are reviewed from time to time so that we are able to 

identify foreseeable hazards and to monitor the effectiveness of local risk control implemented. 

 

In addition, measures have been put in place to reduce noise and air pollution within and outside our 

manufacturing plants. For example, regular maintenance and inspections of the compressors are 

carried out and compressed air guns in our manufacturing plants are used in short intervals in order 

to cut noise and air pollution. We also place signs in areas where hearing protection is mandatory so 

that employees are not exposed to excessive noise. 

 

We require our employees and occupants in each building to familiarise themselves with the 

emergency evacuation plans and procedures. The plans and procedures are reviewed and revised, as 

necessary, after any incident. In addition, fire drills are conducted twice a year in order to familiarise 

our employees with the evacuation procedures during a fire. No workplace fatalities and major 

accidents among our employees were recorded during the reporting period.

Our Suppliers and Customers 

 

Supplier Assessment 

 

Our suppliers are an important part of our value chain. As a world-class equipment manufacturer, we 

source raw materials from a wide range of suppliers. We expect our suppliers to provide top-quality 

raw materials and products and operate in a sustainable manner that is consistent with our values 

and standards.  

 

We have a stringent selection process for our all suppliers. Procurement standards are established to 

select, monitor, audit and manage our suppliers in order to ensure quality materials are purchased 

and used in the production process. We maintain a list of approved suppliers from which we procure 

materials for our production of equipment and monitor their performance over time. In addition, we 

encourage our suppliers to achieve a 100% on time delivery rate. Suppliers that fail to meet our 

standards will be removed from the list. In FY2017, all our suppliers and vendors met our specification 

requirements and expectations for quality and delivery. We conduct due diligence on all of suppliers 

based on their ability to meet our requirements before engaging them. However, no new suppliers 

were engaged during the reporting period.  

 

Our suppliers are required to comply with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive, 

which includes a CE2-marking directive. We also expect our suppliers to meet the requirements of 

relevant laws and regulations.

Marketing and Labelling 

 

Clear and accurate labelling is essential to ensure safe and effective use of machines and equipment.  

It is our responsibility to ensure that machines and equipment manufactured by ASA are classified and 

labelled accurately, in compliance with all necessary labelling guidance. Failure to follow the labelling 

guidance can result in negative consequences such as product recalls and withdrawals.   

 

We have a mechanism in place to ensure labels on our machines and equipment contain the right 

information and instructions for correct and safe operation. We monitor the latest industry trends 

and developments regularly and offer our employees training on relevant guidelines relating to 

product marketing and labelling. In FY2017, there were no incidents of non-compliance with 

regulations concerning product information and labelling reported.

Regulatory Compliance 

Compliance with Laws and Regulations  

 

At ASA, we are committed to good corporate governance practices in order to gain stakeholders’ 

trust, provide accountability and maintain the necessary license to operate. We have procedures and 

risk management standards in place to ensure that we comply with relevant laws, including 

environmental laws and socioeconomic regulations. We also expect and require all our employees to 

observe the highest standards of integrity in the day-to-day conduct of our business. 

 

Environmental Compliance  

 

We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the places where we operate. In 

Singapore, we are required to comply with laws and regulations set by the National Environmental 

Agency (NEA), the Public Utilities Board (PUB) and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). A breach 

of any law or regulation will significantly inhibit our ability to operate. 

 

We have an environmental management system (EMS) in place to miminise our impacts and ensure 

that we comply with all relevant environmental legislation. In FY2017, there were no incidents of non-

compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

At ASA, we have zero tolerance for bribery and corruption. We require our employees to adhere to 

the Code of Conduct and policies on corruption within the Group. Information on the Code of 

Conduct, which includes ethical requirements and information on the whistle-blowing policy is 

provided to employees.  

 

ASA has a whistle-blowing policy, which enables employees to express any concerns they have about 

suspected fraud, corruption, dishonest practices or other similar matters. Any suspicious practices or 

inappropriate activities involving our employees are brought to the attention of the Head of Human 

Resources (“HR”) and/or any member of the Executive Committee. Employees who are found guilty of 

fraud, dishonesty or criminal conduct are will be held personally liable for their actions and 

disciplinary action will be taken towards these employees.  

 

In FY2017, there were zero incidents of non-compliance with anti-corruption laws and socioeconomic 

regulations.
