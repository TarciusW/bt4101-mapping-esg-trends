Organisation Profile  

 

As a property investment, development and management company, the Group has 

planted the seeds of investment in the following areas. The Group acquired 60% of Global 

Entertainment Media Pte. Ltd. (“GEM”) which holds a 50-year operating rights to the 

Wonder Stone Park (the “WSP”), a park exhibiting naturally occurring stone boulders and 

rocks of a wide variety of sizes, colour and patterns and which are specifically native 

to Fei county (a county of Linyi city) in The People’s Republic of China. The WSP is 

currently in the midst of being developed into a mixed-use development and a tourist 

attraction with a theme park featuring rides and attractions.  

As part of the acquisition of a 60% stake in GEM1, a hotel located strategically within 

the WSP was also acquired. On 18 February 2019, the Group announced that they 

had signed a license agreement with the Inzone Hotels &amp; Resorts Group for the hotel 

to operate under the “Inzone” brand (the “Brand”). Under this license agreement, 

Inzone Hotels &amp; Resorts Group has also been appointed to manage the hotel.  

Further to the Group’s attempt to seek out collaborations with professional business 

partners, a memorandum of understanding was signed with Sim Leisure Group (“SLG”) 

on 1 September 2018 where SLG will invest and operate a theme park at WSP that is 

designed based on their “ESCAPE” brand of theme park in Penang, Malaysia. The 

Group and SLG are currently in the final stages of formalising an operating lease 

agreement which will set out the terms of the cooperation.  

The Company also announced the incorporation of Fei County Yin Sheng Real Estate 

Co., Ltd (“Yin Sheng Real Estate”) to spearhead the property development and 

investment segment. As its maiden project, Yin Sheng Real Estate is holding 

discussions with potential collaboration partners to jointly undertake the development 

of the 2 plots of land, measuring 13,409 square meters and 27,681 square meters 

respectively, acquired in WSP. The development plans are in the final stages of being 

firmed up.  Zoned for commercial and mixed-use in the WSP, the Group is confident 

of the prospects of the development and will continuously review the property market 

to identify future opportunities. 

 

 

1On 27 September 2018, the Company announced that it had entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with 

Fortsmith Investments Limited (the “Vendor”) to acquire the remaining 40% stake in GEM (the “40% Acquisition”).  Under the 

conditions precedent of the SPA, the Company is required to, amongst other conditions precedent, to obtain the approval of the 

shareholders of the Company at an extraordinary general meeting to be convened.  On 28 March 2019, the Company announced 

that it had entered into Supplemental Agreement with the Vendor to extend the completion date of the 40% Acquisition to 30 

September 2019, or such later date as the Company and the Vendor may mutually agree in writing.

remains competitive, we believe that with our strategic business decisions and astute 

foresight, we will achieve sustainable returns for our stakeholders.

The Group takes a strong stand against corrupt practices and strategies, and this 

value has been communicated to all of our employees, major suppliers and business

Reporting Practice 

 

The Group’s first sustainability report has been produced in accordance with the 

Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards “Core” option covering our performance 

from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018. The GRI Standards represent the global best 

practices for reporting on economic, environmental and social topics. The Company 

has engaged an external consultant to advise in its preparation of this sustainability 

report. 

The report incorporates the primary components of report content as set out by the 

SGX’s “Comply or Explain” requirements on sustainability reporting under Listing Rule 

711B and Practice Note 7F of the Listing Manual Section B: Rules of the Catalist of 

the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited. 

GRI does not require external assurance and our Sustainability Task Force has 

assessed that external assurance is not required as the Group is laying the 

foundations for a sustainability reporting framework this year.

Leisure and hospitality 

The Group has identified cultural tourism as an area of growth in China. Under the 

auspices of the Shandong provincial government, tourism has been identified as a major 

sector for growth. “好客山东” (or “Hospitable Shandong”) is one of the highest 

accolade and branding that aptly describes Shandong province and it ranks highly among 

provinces in terms of tourist visitor-ship. Blessed with a richness of cultural heritage, the 

amalgamation of culture and tourism is a natural attraction to visitors within China and 

from overseas.  

The Group endeavours to preserve the culture of this area in our operations. Specifically, 

the WSP integrates an exhibition of unique stones found in the region, a garden tour, 

leisure and entertainment activities with folk culture. After acquiring the hotel property, we 

added the finishing touches to the construction of the hotel, and we are in the planning 

stage of developing the theme park. Further, the WSP will be developed into a mixed-use 

development and a tourist attraction with a theme park featuring rides and attractions.  

 

Environmental Sustainability 

GRI 301-2, 302-5, 304-2, 306-1, 308-1, 308-2 

Given the nature and locality of the operations of the hotel in WSP, we are aware that 

there will be certain environmental impact, such as energy and water wastage, waste 

generation and effluents discharge. As such, the Group is committed to preserving the 

surrounding biodiversity and minimising negative environmental impacts of our hotel and 

tourism operations. We conduct in-house environmental impact assessments on an 

annual basis to identify the anticipated effects of our operations on the environment to 

mitigate the environmental risks of our operations through optimised management and 

operations.  

We aim to implement sustainable practices and features at the hotel, such as purchasing 

environmentally-friendly products and recycling hotel supplies wherever possible to 

reduce waste generation. Our hotel uses solar energy to power its operations, thus 

reducing consumption of energy from non-renewable sources. It also has its own 

wastewater treatment facility to ensure that wastewater is processed in accordance to 

regulatory requirements before discharge. 

We select our hotel operator based on their track record and environmental performance 

to ensure that our hotel operations will be managed in a sustainable and eco-friendly 

manner. We also assess the environmental performance of our suppliers on an annual 

basis in an effort to establish a sustainable supply chain in our hotel management. We 

evaluate them based on their energy and water conservation measures, as well as their 

waste management and recycling practices. 


11 

IMPERIUM CROWN LIMITED 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 

 

The construction of our hotel was in strict compliance with local environmental laws 

and regulations, and in FY2018 and up to the date of this report, there has not been 

any reported incident of non-compliance with relevant environmental regulations 

among our contractors and subcontractors.  

 

Social Sustainability 

GRI 202-1, 203-2, 204-1, 413-1, 414-1, 414-2. 419-1 

With the WSP being an upcoming tourist attraction, we envision to contribute to the 

booming tourism industry in the Shandong province and attract more tourists, thereby 

boosting the economy in the local community. We endeavour to preserve and promote 

the site safety, uniqueness and recognition of the WSP as well as the surrounding tourist 

spots. 

Additionally, we believe that the ease of people moving around is important. With the 

WSP situated within a five-minute drive from the city centre, bus terminal and major 

expressways, connectivity in the community is going to be enhanced with our presence 

and the current infrastructure, via the highways connected to major cities and the soon-

to-be completed Fei county high speed rail station which are constructed as part of the 

development plans of the government.  

Furthermore, we are committed to economic and social development by hiring from 

the local community to improve social conditions and community development. We 

also procure from local suppliers wherever possible to support local businesses and 

the economy. We endeavour to achieve 50% of local hire and procurement vendors 

for future operations. 

Other than increasing jobs and business opportunities available for the local 

community, we conduct social impact assessments of our operations and include 

assessment factors such as local employment and equal opportunities to ensure that 

negative social impacts on the local community are minimised. We will strive to 

minimise food and resource wastage by making responsible, sustainable purchase 

decisions. 

 

We conduct supplier evaluation on an annual basis to ensure that our contractors and 

hotel operator operate in strict compliance with local social and economic laws and 

regulations. In FY2018 and up to the date of this report, there has not been any 

reported incident of non-compliance in FY2018.
