Board Statement 

 

The Board of directors of the Company (the "Board") is pleased to present the “Sustainability Report” 

which is our continued commitment to share our sustainability journey with all our stakeholders in a 

transparent manner. In this report, we have shared highlights on how we have progressed and our focus 

going forward. 

 

The battle against the COVID-19 pandemic is turning out to be the defining test for this generation. In 

early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic placed societies and industries across the globe under pressure 

from an unprecedented crisis. At Colex, we were prompt in implementing a series of measures as 

required by the government to protect the safety and health of our workforce, and our communities. 

We continue to monitor changes to the guidelines so as to keep ourselves up to date to ensure the 

continued safety of the various stakeholders. 

As a responsible organisation, it is our constant endeavour to lead the waste management and contract 

cleaning sector with credibility and a strong focus on corporate social responsibility. To do so, we place 

utmost emphasis on understanding and meeting stakeholder expectations. In our process to safeguard 

the interests of our stakeholders, we engage with them through various platforms and modes, on a 

regular basis. We believe in holistic commitment towards people, environment and business will carry 

us forward towards a responsible, resilient and reliable future. 

The Board strives to ensure that environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues are incorporated 

into company’s overall strategy and is responsible for the oversight of the management of sustainability 

performance. The Board is supported by a Sustainability Steering Committee made up of 

representatives from various divisions across Colex to develop and implement sustainability policies and 

initiatives. The committee also manages and monitor’s sustainability risks, opportunities and 

performance. The Board is also involved in reviewing material ESG topics, key performance indicators 

(“KPIs”) and targets for each ESG topic. 

 

This report is an effort to showcase our sustainability performance and share good practices. The Board 

is grateful towards all the stakeholders for contributing to our journey of transformation towards 

sustainability.

Managing business continuity in COVID-19 

As we navigate the different stages of the coronavirus pandemic and the consequent economic and 

social impacts across different geographies, our priority is always safeguarding and supporting our 

people-employees, as well as those in our communities. We will continue to review and adopt the health 

and safety precautions, as well as new working protocols implemented in line with advisories from 

government. Despite the uncertainty leading to business disruptions, we have showcased a strong 

commitment toward our stakeholders since the outbreak of the global pandemic.  

During the pandemic, effective board governance and oversight was emphasized by constantly 

monitoring and reviewing and managing the risks and opportunities to ensure that the Company 

remains resilient and sustainable.  

Business continuity during COVID-19 

COVID-19 outbreak has impacted our waste disposal operations, especially in the hotels, commercial 

malls and F&amp;B sectors as most of our customers suspended the disposal service contracts during the 

Circuit Breaker (CB) or asked for rebate due to reduced collections. Our cleaning operations business 

was impacted the most in the hospitality and retail sectors leading to suspension of contracts during CB 

and our cleaning operation in other sectors was also impacted because our customers asked for rebate 

due to reduced manpower deployed during CB. 

The pandemic presented an extraordinary challenge of shortage of supply of hand sanitizer and 

disinfectants due to shortage of alcohol worldwide along with reduction in manpower due to the closure 

of the Singapore/Malaysian border under the Movement Control Order (“MCO”). Restriction of 

movements from dormitory imposed operational challenges in terms of labour, logistics and resource 

flow. Nevertheless, accommodation and daily transport was provided for Malaysian workers who were 

stranded in Singapore due to the MCO.  

Keeping safety of stakeholders, a priority  

Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we adhered to government’s call to institute safe 

distancing measures and embraced work from home. We implemented mandatory health and safety 

protocols issued by the government agencies. The establishment has also deployed the use of Zoom to 

facilitate remote working and online collaboration. 

Timely updates on the evolving COVID-19 situation, enforcing safe distancing measures, restriction on 

human movement, usage of masks, increased cleaning and disinfecting, staggered working hours, using 

QR code for contact tracing and temperature screening was provided to all the employees. 

Employees were also supported through the difficult times. Foreign workers who were unable to go 

home were provided lodging and transport assistance. Moreover, to reduce the risk of transmission, 

office and client meetings were conducted via Zoom.  

The precautionary guidelines were also extended to the visitors and proper safety protocols were 

followed like recording their requisite details for contact tracing and mandatory mask and temperature 

screening policy. In addition, hand sanitizers and disinfectants were provided to our customers. 

With the government wage support measures, all our employees are kept in our employment with full 

payment throughout the CB period and beyond.

Stakeholder Engagement  

We establish and nurture relationships with our relevant stakeholders by instituting trust, transparency 

and an ethical work culture. These engagements provide us with opportunities to understand the views 

and expectations of our stakeholders. Feedback received from stakeholders is assessed and analysed to 

identify critical concerns which are discussed at relevant board committee meetings. The responsibility 

for identifying and addressing these concerns lies with the relevant departments.  

The table below illustrates how we engage with our different stakeholders:

Materiality  

Our materiality assessment identifies and prioritises the most significant sustainability topics, which aid 

in defining our sustainability goals and the alignment with our business aspirations. We had previously, 

in 2017, undertaken a structured process to prioritise the key topics material to our stakeholders and 

Company across the economic, environmental and social bottom lines. This process was in line with the 

GRI Standards Materiality and Stakeholder Engagement Principle. Through an internal stakeholder 

survey and a workshop involving Colex’s representatives, the material topics were prioritised using a 

materiality matrix and based on consideration of the following factors:  

 

• 

Global and local emerging sustainability trends; and 

• 

Material topics identified by industry peers.  

 

The material ESG factors determined formed the basis of our sustainability efforts and reporting. This 

year, we have reviewed and revalidated the list of material factors and have considered the interests 

and concerns of our key stakeholders, megatrends and the current state of our business model.  

 

The following table summarises Colex’s material factors identified:

Environmental 

The scope of environmental factors covers only our waste management operations under CEPL which 

account for most of the material issues in respect of waste and recycling, water and effluents and energy 

and emissions arising from our operations. We recognise the importance of reducing impact on the 

natural environment. 

Waste and Recycling 

FY2020’s Performance 

Amount of waste collected for recycling and/or composting: 921 tonnes (0.55% of total 

waste collected) 

Performance against FY2020’s Target 

Continued to bundle waste disposal and recycling services to further encourage recycling of 

waste, in line with our target for FY2020 

FY2021’s Target 

Continue to bundle waste recycling services to further encourage recycling of waste. 

 

As a waste management provider, Colex contributes towards protecting the environment by managing 

the waste generated in the areas we serve in an efficient and sustainable manner. 

In 2020, we take great pride in serving private condominiums in Singapore in their waste and recycling 

needs. We view this as an opportunity for us to fulfil a community service obligation and strive to ensure 

that our services are delivered to a high standard. At the beginning of each day, a driver job card with 

an assigned collection route is provided to each driver collecting waste. Waste pick-ups are tracked and 

monitored through a Global Positioning System (“GPS”) tracker installed on each collection truck. Each 

driver’s job card is signed off by a supervisor upon returning to the site of the facility. Furthermore, the 

bodies of our general waste and recycling trucks are painted yellow and blue respectively to ensure that 

the trucks are easily distinguishable. These control measures ensure that waste is collected and sent to 

the disposal sites or MRF appropriately.  

Colex encourages recycling by offering our clients the option of bundling recycling services with general 

waste contracts. We have strategically placed signages around the areas we serve to direct more 

residents towards our recycling bins. We also encourage recycling through our Cash-for-Trash initiative 

which incentivizes residents to recycle their unwanted items with Colex. 

All commercial, industrial and residential recyclable materials collected are taken to the MRF where the 

sorting of carton boxes, paper, plastics, metal and aluminium takes place. The sorted recyclables will 

subsequently be sold to various vendors to be used locally or exported. 

The amount of waste collected for recycling and composting (garden waste) decreased from 1,663 

tonnes in FY2019 to 921 tonnes in FY2020. Further, the percentage of waste collected for recycling and 

composting over the total waste collected decreased slightly from 0.59% in FY2019 to 0.55% in FY2020. 

The table below shows a breakdown of the amount of waste collected:


 

Table: Waste collected for recycling, composting and disposal 

At our MRF, the percentage of materials recovered is about 25% of the total materials collected for 

recycling, which remained relatively constant from FY2018. 

As for Colex’s daily waste management operations, one of the main wastes that we generate is engine oil 

from our workshops. As engine oil is a toxic waste which cannot be recovered, we have engaged waste 

disposal specialists for the safe handling and incineration of the waste. The total engine oil disposed during 

the reporting year was 1,800 litres as compared to 3,400 litres in FY2019. It was due to a reduction in a 

usable fleet size. 

Water and Effluents 

FY2020’s Performance 

Water intensity: 0.035 m3/tonne of waste collected 

Performance against FY2020’s Target 

Maintain water intensity at 0.015 m3/tonne of waste collected: Not achieved 

Water intensity increased by 128% from FY2019. 

FY2021’s Target 

Maintain water intensity at current levels 

 

 

According to PUB, Singapore’s total water demand is expected to double by 2060 with the non- domestic 

sector accounting for 70%2. Thus, we are committed to consume water responsibly to avoid unnecessary 

wastage and reduce water stress in the region. 

Washing trucks and cleaning the MRF accounts for significant water withdrawal and wastewater generated 

for Colex. We strive to improve water efficiency in our operations. To reduce our water withdrawal, training 

and information on water-saving measures are provided to truck drivers to raise awareness on water 

conservation. We also use rainwater stored in a tank in our daily operations. 

The chart below shows our annual water withdrawal and water intensity calculated using annual water 

withdrawal over the total amount of waste collected in tonnes during the year.

All water used on our premises and in our business operations was from the Public Utilities Board 

("PUB”). In FY2020, our water withdrawal was 5,854 m3, an increase of 36.4% from 4,293 m3 in FY2019. 

Our water intensity has increased by 133% from 0.015 m3/tonne in FY2019 to 0.035 m3/tonne in FY2020. 

We note that we did not achieve our FY2020 target, but this was as a result of workers having to stay in 

the depot as temporary living quarters during COVID-19 pandemic. There was an increase in water 

usage for the personal needs like bathing and washing.   

Meanwhile, we ensure that potential environmental and health risks are mitigated by taking adequate 

measures to manage the discharge of wastewater from the washing of trucks and the cleaning of the 

MRF. We engage a licensed contractor to collect wastewater generated on a daily basis which is finally 

sent to a third-party treatment plant. A wastewater treatment plant installed at Colex since December 

2018 helps in reducing the water withdrawal and intensity as the treated water is reused together with 

rainwater collected for truck washing purposes.

Energy consumption accounts for a substantial portion of operating costs and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) 

emissions. The equipment in our MRF run on electricity, while some machines, tools, as well as trucks 

and vans used in our operations consume diesel. We strive to reduce our energy consumption to lower 

our operating costs and cut down our carbon footprint. We have implemented robust monitoring and 

management systems to ensure energy efficiency. We note that we did not achieve our FY2020 target, 

as a result of workers having to stay in the depot as temporary living quarters during COVID-19 

pandemic. There was an increase in energy consumption and emissions for the depot. 

To reduce our energy consumption and GHG emissions, we use fuel-efficient vehicles in our operations 

and regularly upgrade existing vehicles. Training is provided to each truck driver on using the shortest 

routes possible and tracking each vehicle’s diesel consumption using a computerized system. Trucks and 

vans that have high diesel consumption are inspected and serviced if required and the diesel 

consumption of each vehicle is presented to the management on a monthly basis. In addition, we use 

automated trucks and electric lifters when collecting and sorting waste as a way of cutting down on 

GHG emissions and noise pollution in the areas we serve. All vehicles are inspected yearly to comply 

with the Land Transport Authority’s Carbon Emissions-Based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS). We also adhere to 

United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)’s R101 Fuel Consumption standards. To 

promote environmental awareness, a truck inspection manual is provided to each truck driver and 

posters on environmental issues are displayed within our premises. Beyond energy efficiency, we also 

make sure that our vehicles comply with the pollution emission standards.  

Currently, we own 26 Euro 5 vehicles, 29 Euro 4 vehicles and 10 Euro 3 vehicles. As such, all 65 of our 

vehicles use high-quality, low-sulphur diesel that is purchased directly from the refinery. 

At Colex’s office, we use energy-efficient appliances such as LED lights, motion sensors and an efficient 

air-conditioner. We disconnect the electricity supply to the MRF and encourage our employees to turn 

off lights when they are not in use. We track and carefully monitor the MRF’s electricity consumption 

and regularly report its usage to the management every month. This measure allows us to promptly 

identify any issues leading to abnormally high consumption. 

The chart below illustrates our total energy consumption which consists of diesel3 and electricity used 

within our waste management operations, and our total energy intensity which is calculated based on 

total energy consumption over total waste collected in tonnes during the year. 

 

 

 

 

3Diesel consumption is converted from litres to joules using the conversion factors derived from IPCC 2006, IEA 2005.

Our total energy consumption for FY2020 is 42,465 GJ, a decrease of 26.8% from 58,019 GJ of total 

energy used in FY2019. Nevertheless, our total energy intensity has increased by 24.0% from 0.204 

GJ/tonne in FY2019 to 0.253 GJ/tonne in FY2020. The decrease in non-hazardous waste collected in 

comparison to FY2019 was due to a drastic drop in waste generated by hotels and shopping malls due 

to COVID-19 restrictions.

We recognize that some of our employees may be exposed to health and safety risks in their regular 

scope of work and duties. We strive for an incident and injury-free workplace by implementing safety 

practices and continually look for ways to reduce health and safety risks wherever possible. It is our 

responsibility to ensure that the working conditions of our employees adhere to international standards. 

All our sites were certified under ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 standards. 

 

 

ISO 9001:2015 specifies the requirements for a quality management system to meet customer and 

applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, while  

ISO 14001:2015 specifies the requirements for an environmental management system to enhance 

environmental performance.  

 

Our operations are assessed for health and safety risks on a regular basis. Colex has been certified by 

an external auditor recognized by the Singapore Accreditation Council to attain the bizSAFE Level 3 

status. BizSAFE is a five-step programme to help companies build up capabilities in addressing workplace 

safety, health and security. Members of Colex’s top management team took part in a bizSAFE Workshop 

for Top Management conducted by a bizSAFE service provider. A Risk Management (“RM”) Champion 

was then appointed to participate in a bizSAFE course to develop a RM Implementation Plan. Upon

new employees to attend a safety induction course and has given each employee a safety handbook

for work. We have an emergency response team on standby, who are trained in firefighting and first 

aid, in compliance with the Singapore Civil Defence Force’s requirements for facilities with on-site diesel 

tanks. 

In addition, we adhere to the National Environment Agency (“NEA”)’s Safety Guide for General Waste 

Collectors. In our cleaning business, we provide training to all our cleaners on the proper handling of

Local Communities 

FY2020’s Performance 

Implemented several awareness-raising initiatives that have a positive impact on our 

communities, as illustrated below 

Performance against FY2020’s Targets 

Continue to raise public awareness of recycling through educational trips to our MRF: Not 

achieved  

FY2021’s Targets 

Continue to raise public awareness of recycling through other means, e.g. Ecomation apps 

 

Colex takes responsibility in promoting better waste management and encouraging the use of recycling 

amongst the local communities. Colex believes that such actions are essential to foster a clean and 

healthy community. Due to COVID-19 social distancing measures we cancelled the tours and education 

trips to our facilities from February 2020.  

While our business operations can have some negative impacts on local communities, such as noise 

pollution, traffic congestion and road safety hazards, we are working towards minimising such issues 

through the careful planning and monitoring of our waste collection schedule. Our waste collection 

schedule is based on the needs of our residents, ensuring quality services to the communities we serve. 

For example, the driver’s card is signed off by a supervisor daily to ensure that each driver adheres to 

the waste collection schedule. Moreover, we have stopped our waste collection activities at business 

centres during peak and lunch hours and have adjusted our waste collection schedules and routes 

according to routines of residents. Our cleaning services are adjusted based on clients’ schedules and 

needs and their demands and services are monitored on a regular basis. In the wake of COVID-19, 

frequency of cleaning and disinfection of high-touch points was stepped up to keep the environment 

safe for users. 

We have a strict no-missed collection policy and require our drivers to adhere to a 7 am – 7 pm collection 

schedule. All our trucks are fitted with speed limiters and our truck drivers are required to adhere to a 

speed limit of 60 km/h so as not to endanger the safety of our communities.

Compliance 

FY2020’s Performance 

Zero incidents of significant 9 non-compliance with all relevant socioeconomic and environmental 

laws and regulations 

Performance against FY2020’s Target 

Achieved our FY2020’s target of achieving zero incidents of significant non-compliance with all 

relevant socioeconomic and environmental laws and regulations 

FY2021’s Target 

Achieve zero incidents of significant non-compliance with all relevant socioeconomic and 

environmental laws and regulations. 

 

 

Colex strives to comply with various laws and regulations. We are committed to meeting the 

requirements of NEA’s environmental and public health regulations and MOM’s labour and safety 

regulations in order to minimise harm to human health and the environment. For FY2020, all rear 

loaders were to be fitted with 360-degree camera, in compliance with NEA’s Regulations. In FY2020, 

there were zero incidents of significant non-compliance with all relevant socioeconomic and 

environmental laws and regulations. 

We comply with training requirements and send all our drivers and attendants to attend Singapore 

Workforce Skills Qualifications (“WSQ”)’s and NEA’s Clean Mark training programmes. We also ensure 

that our cleaners take WSQ’s courses and are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to 

perform their jobs safely and effectively. We conduct regular checks on employees’ identification cards 

(“IDs”) and work permits to ensure that we are compliant with the MOM’s regulation regarding the 

employment of illegal and “phantom”10 workers. 

At Colex, we ensure compliance with various environmental laws and regulations enforced by NEA, 

other regulatory bodies and international standards (such as ISO 14000). All our operations meet the 

requirements of the ISO 14000 (environmental management) and ISO 9000 (quality management) 

standards. Our employees are also required to familiarise themselves with NEA’s Code of Practice for 

Licensed General Waste Collectors. We have implemented measures to minimise the environmental 

impact of all aspects of our business, which includes ensuring no leakages from trucks and proper 

containment of waste during waste collection. 

We also offer training to directors and relevant employees regularly whenever there are changes made 

to existing laws and policies. Information about these laws and policies is included in the Company 

handbook and is provided to all employees. 

 

 

9 Significant non-compliance is an incident resulting in a fine over SGD 10,000. 

10 Phantom workers do not genuinely work for a company, but their identifications are used for fraudulent 

purposes.
