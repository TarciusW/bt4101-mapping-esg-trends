Board Statement

The board of directors (“Board”) of Eindec is pleased to present the annual sustainability report for

the financial year ended 31 December (“FY”) 2019.

To stay relevant and competitive amidst economic uncertainties and unprecedented challenges

including the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group is committed to doing business in a

responsible manner. We believe that the restructuring programme, which we had embarked on a few

years ago, is a necessary step for the Group and our stakeholders, in particular, our employees, to

broaden our core strengths through reengineering our business processes and embracing

technology to innovate our clean environmental air solutions and products. The transformation from

an equipment manufacturer to a customised clean environmental air solutions provider is targeted to

improve our business sustainability.

As we continue to strengthen our core capabilities, the Board will continue to oversee the

management and monitoring of key factors in our sustainability practices, improving on our

disclosures as well as progressively including metrics and updating targets that are material to our

business.

This sustainability report is prepared with reference to the guidelines of Global Reporting Initiative

(“GRI”) and in compliance with Rules 711A and 711B of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading

Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist (the “Catalist Rules”) as well as the

SGX-ST’s Sustainability Reporting Guide. We have chosen the GRI framework as it is a well-known

and globally-recognised sustainability reporting standard.

This sustainability report highlights the key economic, environmental, social, and governance

(“EESG”) related initiatives carried out throughout the 12-month period, from 1 January 2019 to 31

December 2019, focusing on the Group’s manufacturing facility in Malaysia, and operations in

Singapore.

No external assurance was sought for this report. The EESG data and information provided have not

been verified by an independent third party. This sustainability report is done in good faith and to the

best of our knowledge.

In line with Eindec’s commitment to environmental conservation, this sustainability report will not be

printed. This report is available on Eindec’s corporate website www.eindec.com.sg and under the

Company’s corporate announcements on www.sgx.com.

We welcome feedback from our stakeholders with regards to our sustainability practices and

reporting, which could potentially assist us in improving our policies and systems. You may reach out

Sustainability Approach

Our sustainability approach is focused on generating stable and sustainable value for our

stakeholders by managing the EESG impact, as well as risks and opportunities present in our

businesses.

We take a strategic and comprehensive approach towards sustainability as we acknowledge the

importance of effective EESG strategy and management across the business operations. Any key

issues relating to the sustainability framework will be raised by the management team during board

meetings, where the Board will review and deliberate on the sustainability issues.



We strive to effectively manage social and environmental associated risks and opportunities together

with our teams within the Group and our stakeholders. We also strive to improve our sustainability

performance through regular review of our policy and operational processes to deliver positive

values for our stakeholders, particularly our end customers who place their trust in our air

environmental products and solutions to improve their living environment.

Materiality Assessment

The Board approves the Group’s general policies and strategies including those relating to

sustainability. The management team reports to the Board and is responsible for reviewing the

Group’s sustainability performance, material topics, stakeholder concerns, the setting of targets for

material topics, and establishing systems to collect, verify, and monitor information required for the

sustainability report.

The adoption of the matrix-based approach, which is based on the likelihood and impact of

occurrences to address the Group’s sustainability risk profile and priority issues, allows the Group to

continue to use this method to monitor its risk profile on a regular basis.

The assessment determines how material the economic, environmental, social, and governance risks

and opportunities could have a positive and/or negative impact on the Group’s business. We will

continue to conduct our materiality review on these material EESG factors and incorporate inputs

from our stakeholders.

Economic Performance

We strive to achieve sustainable growth through strengthening our market presence in

the ASEAN countries and China with our innovative and diversified range of clean air

environmental solutions and systems to offer quality environmental air for everyone.

The Group continued its restructuring effort to improve its diversified

range of environmental air solutions and systems that caters to residential,

commercial, and industrial buildings, as well as suitable for applications

beyond the real estate sector such as marine vessels. The restructuring

effort is a necessary step for the Group to revitalise and step up to the

intensifying competitive business environment.

The latest round of property cooling measures in Singapore that took

effect in July 2018, coupled with global uncertainties saw a slowdown in

residential and non-residential constructions in Singapore. As a result, the

Group secured fewer projects in FY2019. Nevertheless, the Group has a

current outstanding balance-of-work on hand of approximately S$6.45

million as at 27 February 2020.

The Group recorded a 7.7% year-on-year increase in revenue, from

S$10.44 million for FY2018 to S$11.25 million for FY2019. The increase

was mainly attributed to contributions from heating, ventilation, and air-

conditioning (“HVAC”) and cleanroom equipment (“CRE”) segments. In

FY2019, the HVAC segment contributed an increase of S$1.01 million or

22.7% in revenue to S$5.46 million, while the CRE segment contributed an

increase of S$0.25 million or 5.9% in revenue to S$4.45 million. The

increase was mainly due to the partial delivery of projects secured in

FY2018, in which the Group experienced delays in secured projects. The

increase in revenue for these two segments, however, was partially offset

by a significant decline in revenue from the air purification (“AP”)

segment, which decreased by S$0.51 million or 40.9% to S$0.73 million in

FY2019. The decline in revenue from the AP segment was attributed to

the continually challenging property market condition in China.

Please refer to the following sections in our annual report for 2019, which

can be downloaded from the SGXNet, for more details on our operations

and financial information:



Operations Review on pages 4 to 6



Financial Review on pages 7 to 9



Financial Statements on pages 54 to 116

Performance in FY2019



Missed the target set for 

FY2019 as the economic 

slowdown led to delays in 

secured projects.



Reduction in operating 

expenses by 10.3% from 

S$5.8 million in FY2018 to 

S$5.2 million in FY2019 

due to the absence of 

impairment of intangible 

assets in FY2019.



Invested in (i) research 

and development on 

industrial dampers to 

comply with the latest test 

standards as well as new 

product development for 

air purification systems, 

and (ii) more headcount to 

expand engineering and 

sales teams.



Continue to drive strategic 

collaboration with 

downstream peers to 

expand our market reach 

in the Asia Pacific region. 

Targets for FY2020



The Group has to cease its 

operations during the 

lockdowns of cities due to 

the COVID-19 pandemic, 

and the Group’s financial 

performance has been 

inevitably affected. 

Notwithstanding this, the 

Group will strive to 

improve its financial 

performance through 

tightened cost control 

measures and improved 

operational efficiency in its 

business activities of 

environmental air solutions 

and systems. 



Continue to explore 

opportunities within the 

Group’s existing range of 

products to drive growth.

At Eindec, we are committed to delivering value and quality clean air control

management solutions and systems in buildings and even vessels for our

customers to benefit the end-users with a quality air environment. We believe

our transformation from an equipment manufacturer to a customised clean

environmental air solutions provider, offering a full suite of services including

analysis of airflow management for buildings, design, and manufacturing of

customised

equipment,

installation,

monitoring

and

maintenance

of

environmental air systems, will continue to drive positive progress for our

core business segments.

We continue to drive towards our vision of becoming a leading clean

environmental air solutions provider under our proprietary “Eindec” and

“Kyodo” brands with our transformation. While the Group emphasises on

better cost management, it also strengthens our overall capabilities gradually

through

(i)

product

innovation

and

development

–

improving

clean

environmental air solutions and systems for our proprietary brands of

products across our three product segments, (ii) marketing and distribution

capabilities – understanding the evolving requirements of end-users and

increasing market reach for our proprietary brands of products, and (iii)

engineering and production capabilities – strengthening our abilities to meet

the increasing sophistication of equipment and systems.

Material Topic: Economic 

Anti-corruption

We are committed to conducting our business with integrity and transparency with no

compromise on corruption.

To effectively monitor anti-corruption practices, the Group adopted

several policies including the Conduct and Discipline Policy, the Conflict of

Interest Policy, and the Fraud and Whistle-Blowing Policy, as pre-emptive

measures to prevent, govern, and facilitate the reporting of any illegal or

unethical practices in the organisation.

For FY2019, there was no incident of non-compliance with the relevant

laws and regulations. There was also no non-compliance relating to

bribery, extortion, fraud, and money laundering.

Performance in FY2019



Achieved the targets set 

for FY2019.



Recorded no incident of 

non-compliance with the 

relevant laws and 

regulations that cover 

corruption, bribery, 

extortion, fraud, and 

money laundering.

Targets for FY2020



Continue to maintain no 

incident of non-

compliance with the 

relevant laws and 

regulations involving 

corruption, bribery, 

extortion, fraud, and 

money laundering.



The Group has zero-tolerance on fraudulent

and

corrupt

practices

that

may

disrupt

business operations and impede the growth

of the business.

Anti-competitive Behaviour

The Group has implemented a Fraud and Whistle-blowing Policy whereby a designated mailing

address and email address are provided for all employees to raise concerns about possible

improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters, which they become aware and to

ensure that:

1.

independent investigations are carried out in an appropriate and timely manner;

2.

appropriate action is taken to correct the weakness in internal controls and policies which

allowed the perpetration of fraud and/ or misconduct and to prevent a recurrence; and

3.

administrative, disciplinary, civil, and/or criminal actions that are initiated following the completion

of investigations are appropriate, balanced, and fair while providing reassurance that employees

will be protected from reprisals or victimisation for whistle-blowing in good faith and without

malice.

Please refer to the Corporate Governance Report section in the Company’s annual report for

FY2019, which can be downloaded from the SGXNet, for more details on the following policies and

practices of the Group:

impact our operations have on the environment. As a responsible corporate citizen, we will do our

part to reduce emissions, while ensuring that we continue to grow and prosper.

The Group operates a manufacturing facility in Malaysia to manufacture the range of clean air

environmental products and systems. The disposal of wastes, rejected finished goods, defective raw

materials, and machinery and equipment, were guided by the rules and regulations applicable to

Licensed Manufacturing Warehouse under the Malaysian Customs Act. We have engaged a third-

party service provider to manage all proper disposal of our scraps and wastages.

As part of our environmental conservation effort, we have implemented energy savings and recycling

within our offices. These include maintaining unnecessary wastage such as two-sided printing, using

recycled paper for printing, and switching off lights in office premises when not in use.

We are pleased to disclose that there was no violation of laws and regulations in the environmental

aspect for the year under review.

Rules of Catalist.

Enterprise Risk Management

The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk

management framework.

The Group had engaged third party professional to establish the Group’s Risk Control Assurance

Framework. Risk management policies have been established to identify and analyse the key risks

faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, develop a risk control matrix, and to

implement procedures to monitor and report risks and adherence to limits.

Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market

conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through training and management standards and

procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment whereby all

employees understand their roles and obligations.

The Audit Committee of the Company oversees how the management monitors compliance with the

the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Audit Committee is

assisted in its oversight role by the internal auditor. The internal auditor undertakes both regular and

ad-hoc reviews of the Group’s risk management controls and procedures and reports its findings to
