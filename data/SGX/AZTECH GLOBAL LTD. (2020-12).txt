Board Statement 

Listed on the Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited on 12 

March 2021, Aztech Global Ltd. ("Aztech", the "Company", and together with its subsidiaries,

2020 had been an extraordinary year for Aztech as we grappled with and learnt to 

respond to unprecedented challenges emanating from the COVID-19 pandemic. The 

Group, like the rest of the world, has had to adapt to the new normal. The Group was not 

immune to the health, social and economic impact brought about by the outbreak. Task 

force at our offices and facilities were set up to manage the situation and measures 

were implemented to prevent the spread of the COVID-19. We are glad that the Aztech 

Global team had responded swiftly and resiliently to the challenges set before us, 

mitigating the impact of the pandemic by conserving resources, while focusing to 

achieve impeccable execution of customer orders during the year. The Group has stood 

up to the test to deliver a strong set of results for FY2020.

Sustainability is a part of the Group’s wider strategy to create long-term value for all its 

stakeholders. As such, the key material economic, environmental, social and governance 

(“EESG”) factors for the Group have been identified and cautiously reviewed by the 

management annually. The data and information provided in this report have not been 

verified by an independent third party. The management has relied on internal data 

monitoring and verification to ensure accuracy of data and information. 

The Board has taken up the responsibility of overseeing the Group’s EESG initiatives and 

assessing the material EESG factors that are significant to the Group. This report plays an 

essential role in enhancing transparency, accountability and progress towards our 

sustainable growth. We invite our stakeholders to journey with us to achieve greater 

sustainability in our operations.

Identification

Prioritisation

Validation

Review

Our sustainability process begins with the identification of relevant factors. Relevant 

factors are then prioritised to identify material factors which are validated internally. 

The end result of this process is a list of material factors disclosed in the Sustainability 

Report. Process of which are as shown below:

We have conducted a materiality assessment with the help of an external consultant 

to identify and determine the material EESG factors. EESG factors were identified and 

prioritised through internal workshops, peer reviews and social impact assessments 

at site level. Thereafter, we intend to conduct a materiality review every year, 

incorporating inputs from stakeholders’ engagements.

To determine if an EESG factor is material, we assessed its potential impact on the 

economy, environment, society and the influence on the various internal and external 

stakeholders of Aztech. Applying the guidance from GRI, we have identified and 

maintained the following material EESG factors:

2020 Aztech Global Sustainability Report



Aztech firmly believes that focusing on financial sustainability is critical. This is built on 

the Company’s basic principle that long-term profitability and shareholder value is 

ensured by taking into account the interests of stakeholders, such as shareholders, 

employees, customers, suppliers and society as a whole. 

The Group had reported an 18.1% increase in net profit after tax to $55.7 million, while its 

revenue grew 12.9% to $484.3 million for FY2020. This was achieved despite disruption to 

its operating environment caused by COVID-19 pandemic during the first quarter of 

2020. Though the pandemic had posed challenges, the team has been focusing on our 

strong collaborative relationship with our customers and leveraging on opportunities 

that our robust product portfolio and core technological capabilities can offer to the 

growing IoT, Data-communication and LED lighting industries.

Agility and resourcefulness of the team, together with our flexible manufacturing 

capability, led to an improvement in revenue mix, productivity and efficiency that 

lifted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation expenses 

(EBITDA) by 18.7% to $76.3 million, and EBITDA margin added 80 basis points to 15.8% for 

FY2020. Profit before tax grew 21.4% to $66.5 million, while net profit after taxation 

increased by 18.1% to $55.7 million. Profit was partly negated by higher tax expenses 

arising from higher pre-tax profits for FY2020 and the full utilisation of group tax relief 

in the previous financial year. Net profit margin, however, added 50 bps to 11.5%, and 

earnings per share improved to 9.00 cents.

Aztech does not have a fixed dividend policy. The declaration and payment of future 

dividends may be recommended by the Directors at their discretion, after considering 

a number of factors deemed relevant by the Directors, including but not limited to the 

level of the Company’s cash and reserves, the Group’s actual and projected financial 

performance, the projected levels of capital expenditure, working capital 

requirements and investment plans, financial, regulatory or general economic 

conditions.

At Aztech, all employees have access to the same opportunities. We do not allow 

unfair discrimination based on gender, race, religion, sexual preference or age. Where 

the required skills are not available, the focus is on expatriate assignments, with the 

commitment to develop a local skills base. Expatriates are in general assigned for 

specific periods under certain conditions and return to their home countries on 

completion of the assignment. In our Group, management team is defined as heads of 

department in the location of operations.

In FY2020, 89% of the management team in all locations are hired from the respective 

local communities. We comply with legislation when recruiting locally and procedures 

for hiring include advertising, developing people from within the company, 

involvement in the community and educational institutions to source potential 

employees and learners.

Our Target (FY2021)

• Maintain the Group’s hiring of management personnel from

 the local communities at a minimum average of 80%.


11

Anti-corruption

Aztech does not tolerate any form of corruption. This has been made clear to all of our 

employees, suppliers and business partners. Amongst policies adopted include 

Conflict of Interest Policy as well as Fraud and Whistleblowing Policy. Reports of 

suspected fraud, corruption, dishonest practices or other similar matters can be 

lodged with the Chairman of the Audit Committee at whistleblower@aztech.com or 

sent by mail to 31 Ubi Road 1, #01-05, Singapore 408694. There were no incidents of 

corruption reported in FY2020. We aim to achieve zero incidents of corruption in the 

future as well. We will continue to monitor and prevent its occurrence as targeted.



Our Target (FY2021)

• Ensure all the employees sign Anti-corruption declaration.

Energy And Water

Aztech is fully aware of its responsibility for nurturing the environment and lessening 

negative environmental consequences at our worksites and the environment where 

we operate. We monitor our electricity, fuel and water consumption at our workplaces 

to ensure that we use our resources economically, meaningfully and responsibly. Our 

energy and water consumption is mainly for our office, manufacturing operations and 

motor vehicles. The efficient use of resources is essential for sustained economic 

growth, and we continue to deploy a systematic approach towards integrating 

practices for resource use efficiency into our operations. We are also increasingly 

committed to integrate environmental values into our value chain.

Below are our total energy and water consumption indicators in FY2020. The scope of 

this data includes our three main sites, namely Singapore, Malaysia and China.

Aztech remains dedicated in addressing the effects of climate change through the 

reduction of energy and water consumption, and environmental pollution in our 

operational activities. With the aim to improve energy efficiency in our operations, we 

have implemented several initiatives for our operation sites below:

Dongguan &amp; Malaysia

• 

Implemented central hot water

 

system by using the heat

 

generated by air-conditioner for

 

electricity saving

• 

Implemented time switch and

 

light for switching off the lights

 

automatically when it is not in

 

used

• 

Installed and replaced all T8

To improve our energy consumption efficiency, we seek to implement the various 

energy efficiency initiatives such as converting air conditioners at our dormitories in 

Dongguan with energy efficient inverter systems. In addition, our operation teams in 

China and Malaysia are studying the deployment of Solar System to reduce carbon 

emissions towards renewable energy sources.

Water consumption plays a critical role in Aztech’s business operations. Our primary 

water source is the municipal water supply, purified river water and rainwater. We 

monitor our water use at every site very carefully to avoid and mitigate harmful effects 

of excessive water consumption as well as water discharge. We comply with local 

government regulations for water discharge in all our locations of operations below:

On water and effluents discharge, most of our sites have set minimum standards for 

tracking and monitoring of the quantity and quality of discharge. These standards 

range from internal standards or onsite requirements to local regulations. We are 

pleased to inform that there were no reported incidents of significant non-compliance 

with discharge limits and regulations in FY2020.

Our continuous commitment to monitor our water consumption through several ways 

below:

Malaysia

• 

Educate employees about

 

water usage efficiency 

• 

Encourage awareness in saving

 

water through activities

• 

Perform routine inspections

 

on our plumbing system, water

 

pipes and valves to prevent

 

water leakages

• Improve energy and water consumption efficiency to

 conserve resources. 


15

Environmental 

Compliance

We focus on creating value through our offering of products and services that 

minimise impact on the environment themselves and reduce the environmental 

impact by putting in place proper processes for waste reduction and waste 

management.

In FY2020, Aztech has successfully maintained its ISO 14001 certification for 

Environmental Management Systems for Dongguan, China operation site. We are 

currently at the documentation stage of the ISO 14001 certification process for our 

operation site in Johor, Malaysia. Both operation sites house our manufacturing 

facilities where environmental compliance is core to our continuous operations. 

Hence, we are committed to managing and mitigating impact arising from our 

activities with the best practices through ISO 14001 certification. It provides a 

systematic framework for the integration of environmental management practices by 

supporting environmental protection, preventing pollution, minimising waste, 

reducing energy and material use.

We are pleased to share that there were no reported incidents of environmental 

non-compliance during FY2020. 



ISO14001 Certificate



Our Target (FY2021)

• Maintain ISO 14001 certification for our Dongguan facilities.

• Achieve progressive completion of documentation process

 leading to the achievement of ISO 14001 certification for our

 Johor plant in 2022.

• Maintain zero incident of non-compliance with laws 

 and regulations.

Occupational

Health And Safety

We are also committed to safeguarding our employees’ health and safety against any 

potential workplace hazards. The focus on health and safety is important to the Group. 

It is a fundamental right for our workers to be able to work in a safe environment.  As 

our employees’ wellness is attained, our productivity increases, and our best is 

provided to our customers. By implementing job safety guidelines, we are committed 

to provide a hazard-free workplace to ensure the wellbeing of both our employees 

and the environment.

We have established a strict set of workplace security and administration policies 

applicable to all employees of the Group. This policy ensures that no untoward 

incidents in the premises due to insufficient awareness of security and admin 

measures implemented. It covers a standard procedure to identify and report hazards 

relating to occupational health and safety (OHS) and ensure that appropriate actions 

are taken to manage the risks involved, such as office security, emergency 

procedures, etc. The employees are adequately trained on the policy and procedures 

as well as taking safety measures. 

Trainings are provided to our employees to educate them on potential health and 

safety risks they may face at the workplace so as to equip them with the knowledge to 

eliminate such risks. First aid and fire safety training are also provided to the relevant 

employees as part of their training development programme. Employees of higher risk 

exposure groups are issued protective equipment and regular physical examination 

scheduled to protect them against health or safety risks at work.

Routine maintenance on the fire extinguishers has been performed to ensure it works 

all the time. Besides, routine inspections are performed at the emergency exit access 

such as the fire doors to ensure they are unblocked to allow for quick and safe exit in 

case of an emergency.

Aztech has set up Health and Safety Committee to oversee the management of OHS. 

This Committee ensures that health and safety policies and management systems 

are properly implemented at each site. They are also involved in developing annual 

plans, setting performance indicators, and monitoring them to ensure the safety of the 

working environment. The committee also provides a forum for employees and 

management to work together to mitigate health and safety problems. An effective 

committee is important in helping to prevent injury and illness at workplace. The 

committee also encourage awareness of health and safety issues among workers, 

supervisors, and managers; and develop strategies to make the work environment 

safe and healthy.

In order to determine work-related hazards, Aztech has adopted Job Safety Analysis 

(JSA) process to evaluate the level of hazard for each of the job process. JSA is a 

systematic procedure that breaks each job/task into key training sequences, identifies 

safety elements of each job/task step and coaches the employee on how to avoid 

potential safety hazards.

2020 Aztech Global Sustainability Report

There are several channels that Aztech’s employees can utilise to report work-related 

hazards and hazardous situations. Employees can report directly to their direct 

supervisors verbally, or to top management through the company’s suggestion box, 

email, facsimile, letter, noticeboard etc. Regular operational meetings are also carried 

out to communicate and disseminate OHS management system information.

We believe that the provision of attractive benefits and care for our employees will 

motivate them to deliver quality service and work performance. A motivated 

workforce will further convey a positive and impactful message to our key 

stakeholders and promote a culture of trust and excellence within the Group. We 

provide essential benefits coverage such as medical and insurance coverage for our 

employees. Moreover, we organise several programs to improve our employee’s 

wellness such as fitness, provision of healthy snacks and food, wellness challenge etc. 

We protect our employees’ personal health-related information, and these are 

secured and kept in safety and only authorised person can access them. 

In FY2020, there were 7 minor work injury accidents at our Dongguan operation site. The 

rate of injury in FY2020 was 0.18 per 100 workers in the year. We investigated all 7 

work-related incidents by following company management procedures. Following 

each accident, the management evaluated the situation and sought to implement 

corrective actions to mitigate recurrence of such accidents. Health and Safety Officer 

will verify the implementation and effectiveness of such corrective action. 

We will continue to stress on workplace safety at all times through safety and 

environment campaigns, hazard and awareness training, and monthly inspections.

Aztech has provided its employees with regular trainings to ensure that they upgrade 

their skillsets, continue to keep pace with the growth and developments of the Group, 

and develop professionally. Trainings are conducted to educate our employees about 

the Group’s operation process at all our operation sites.

A training framework, LTD (Learn, Train and Develop) is initiated to promote learning 

and assist employees in taking on new and emerging roles. In this framework, LTD is 

targeted at 3 main areas of employees’ development offering a holistic development 

for all employees. We conduct annual reviews and regular assessments of our 

employees’ training and developmental needs to determine critical skills gaps at both 

department and individual level. Based on the assessed needs, lifelong learning and 

training journey with a career map are crafted.

In FY2020, we conducted trainings on topics such as Technical Skills Development 

Training, Confidentiality Training, Communication Skills Training, Induction Training, 

Safety and Health Training and department/function-specific training.

 

In Singapore office, we provide various trainings conducted by external experts to our 

employees such as SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace, WSQ Creative Leadership and 

Self Development Skills, Service Challenges L1 (SF): Respond to Service Challenges, 

Certificate in Design Experience and Interface, Apply Workplace Safety and Health In 

Construction Sites. 

For our Malaysia site, we continually make investments to provide the tools, resources 

and opportunities for impactful training and development for all employees. This 

includes conducting on-going tailored internal training programs and sponsoring 

employees to attend best-in-class external development programs that align to their 

career aspirations. During this pandemic, virtual trainings with other offices to gain 

technical knowledge of product transfer were also organised.

The average training hours per employee for FY2020 is 15 hours, with total training 

hours amounting to 16,362 hours. We will continue to deploy our resources and offer 

training courses to continuously enhance safety and ensure competency of all our 

employees.

Customer Audits

Aztech’s customers conducted inspections and audits to the Group’s manufacturing 

facilities to verify production quality and health and safety processes as well as other 

operating standards. Our customers will provide feedback on areas to improve on 

after each of the audit and inspection. These help us conform to their standards and 

at the same time, enhance our production qualities and capabilities. In FY2020, our top 

4 customers had carried out audits to our production facilities, and we are pleased to 

confirm that we have passed all the audits and have received the necessary audit 

reports. The following table shows the details of the audits and inspections carried by 

our top 4 customers in FY2020:



Privacy Policy  

Aligned with the Personal Data Protection Act 2021 (No. 26 of 2012), the Group 

respects the right to privacy of our customers and has put in place a privacy 

policy to protect personal data of customers and address how such 

information is to be treated appropriately.

 

In the course of our operations, we are required to collect and retain personal 

information of our customers. Personal information of our customers will be 

used in the provision of our service, and may also be used to improve our 

service and to notify individuals of opportunities which they may be 

interested in. No personal information is provided to third parties except 

where necessary to our business partners who assist us in the provision of our 

services to customers.

Aztech’s staff recruitment and annual appraisal are conducted based on 

performance, work attitude, cooperation with other staff and workers and efficiency 

and effectiveness of work. We do not discriminate employees according to their race, 

age, gender, religion, ethnicity, facial attractiveness, physical impairments, sexual 

preference, political viewpoints or nationality. We strive to achieve a fair proportion of 

diversity in terms of gender, age and nationality in our workforce. We aim to provide 

equal opportunities to all employees based on their individual skillset and 

competencies. 

There were no cases of discrimination reported in FY2020 and we will continue to be 

fair with our employees as well as uphold no discrimination practices in our company 

throughout the years.

The Group regards our employees as our greatest asset. It is because of them that we 

are able to achieve success and growth. It is important for us to maintain continuous 

employee development, provide competitive employee benefits and ensure fair and 

safe working conditions, so that we retain our staff and are positioned as an attractive 

organisation for new talent. Remuneration policies and packages are reviewed 

regularly to ensure that the compensation and benefits are in line with the market and 

that the employees are rewarded for their contributions, thus aligning the interests of 

the employees to those of the Group’s. Variable bonuses are granted to eligible 

employees based on the individual employee’s contribution to the Group, profitability 

of the Group, current economic/business situation, government’s wage guidelines, 

and internal and external salary equality.
