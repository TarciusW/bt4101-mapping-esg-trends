about thiS RepoRt (102-1)

Golden Agri-Resources Ltd (GAR or the Company) published  

its first sustainability report in 2011. Since then, we have 

progressively continued to improve how we report and 

engage with our stakeholders in an open and transparent 

manner.

Through our sustainability reporting, we hope to provide 

stakeholders with a better understanding of our approach 

to responsible palm oil and our progress in meeting our 

commitments.

SCope of thiS RepoRt (102-45, 102-46, 102-48, 102-49, 

102-50, 102-51)

This report covers our environmental, social, economic 

and governance performance across all our plantations, 

mills and some key aspects of palm oil sales operations 

of GAR in Indonesia, which is our main production base 

where we employ the majority of our work force and 

where we have the most impact.

 

Unless otherwise stated, the report does not include the 

Company’s other activities outside of Indonesia.

 

The content of this report focuses primarily on activities 

carried out within the financial year of January to 

December 2017. There have been no restatements of 

information and there are no significant changes in the 

scope of our reporting from the previous report covering 

the financial year 2016.  

RepoRting fRamewoRk (102-49, 102-54)

We have adopted the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 

Standards as our reporting framework. This report has 

been prepared to be in accordance with GRI Standards – 

Core option. This includes adhering to the GRI principles

Materiality:	focusing	on	issues	where	we	can	have	the	

greatest impact and that are most important to our 

business and stakeholders

•	

Completeness:	 including	 all	 information	 that	 is	 of	

significant economic, environmental, and social 

impact to enable stakeholders to assess the Company’s 

performance

In 2017, we updated our assessment of our material 

sustainability issues, please refer to page 26 of the report 

for more information on this.

aSSuRanCe (102-56)

We are committed to working towards the full assurance 

of the information presented in our sustainability report. 

In this report, as with our previous two reports, we have 

sought the calculation and independent verification 

of our GHG emissions for our subsidiary in Indonesia,  

PT SMART Tbk (SMART), by EY. 

In addition, we also commissioned two independent 

assessments from Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) 

to carry out a survey of workplace practices in some of 

our estates in Indonesia, and the Rainforest Alliance (RA) 

to assess the implementation of the GAR Social and 

Environmental Policy (GSEP).

In our downstream business, we continued to face a 

competitive market environment and declining CPO 

prices during the year affected our margins. We remain 

focused on improving operational efficiencies across the 

value chain while offering a larger portfolio of value-added 

products and services to global customers for better 

margins. We will continue to innovate and be responsive 

to changing market demands with our product offerings.

We enter the year 2018 in a robust financial position 

with	sound	liquidity	and	improved	credit	profile	for	the	

financial market. More efficient financing and refinancing 

costs will be our focus in the years ahead.

poSitive outlook foR palm oil

We believe that in the short term, CPO price could 

maintain its position as the increase in production will be 

absorbed by the robust growth in demand. We are also 

confident about the long-term prospects of palm oil. 

As world population and income per capita continue to 

rise, food production needs to double in order to secure 

adequate	 food	 supplies.	 With	 limited	 agricultural	 land,	

the target of producing more food with less area will 

play a vital part in sustainable agriculture. Palm oil is the 

best candidate to fulfil this demand, especially with the 

upcoming industry replanting that is expected to double 

current yields. Apart from food usage, oleochemicals and 

biodiesel will also continue to provide additional demand 

for palm oil as a feedstock.

ShaRing ReSponSible pRaCtiCeS, tRanSfoRming  

ouR Supply Chain

In 2017, we continued to make progress on our journey 

towards responsible palm oil production including taking 

steps towards increased transparency and traceability of 

our supply chain. At the same time, we are taking note of 

areas where we need to improve our performance and 

to this end we have commissioned external assessments 

and a new materiality assessment to help us understand 

where we can improve. 

SignifiCant mileStoneS

As a leading player in the palm oil industry, our 

commitment to responsible palm oil involves not just our 

company’s operations, it extends to our supply chain. To 

meet this commitment, we completed another significant 

milestone in 2017 by achieving 100 percent Traceability 

to the Plantation (TTP) for all GAR-owned mills. This is 

a continuation of the mapping of our suppliers which 

began with the achievement of 100 percent Traceability 

to the Mill in 2015. Our independent suppliers are also 

mapping their supply chains and we aim to have them 

report full TTP by end 2020. 

TTP means we can guarantee the provenance of our 

raw materials and is in line with the efforts of our major 

customers who are also working on full transparency of 

their palm supply chain. But for us, this achievement has 

even greater significance because it is a key part of our 

wider efforts to help our suppliers change for the better. 

Through deeper engagement, we reduce supply chain 

For GAR, 2017 was another year of strong performance, 

demonstrating our distinct and growing competitive edge 

from an integrated business model with a strategically 

balanced portfolio of upstream and downstream 

businesses. GAR’s remarkable performance stemmed 

from our upstream business as plantation output 

rebounded after the previous year’s decline following the 

El Niño phenomenon. At the same time, we were able 

to extract further value as we continue to streamline our 

downstream assets.

After being hit by the severe El Niño in 2015, weather 

conditions became favourable and production picked 

up	from	the	fourth	quarter	of	2016.	Our	fruit	production	

for the reporting period grew by eight percent with an 

average yield of 20.5 tonnes per hectare, which continues 

to be the best amongst our peers. Consistent focus on 

operational efficiencies contributed to the successful 

expansion of the plantations and palm oil mills segment 

EBITDA margin by six percent. 

GAR’s planted area reached over 500,000 hectares by 

the end of the year. Our upstream division also achieved 

its replanting target at almost 10,000 hectares. This 

accelerated replanting is aligned with our intensification 

strategy aimed at improving production yields from each 

hectare of our land. Our strategy involves replanting 

with new and higher yielding seeds, as well as rolling out 

infrastructure for mechanisation and precision agriculture. 

GAR’s Indonesian refineries performed well, achieving 

much higher utilisation rate and a production volume 

record due to our focus on higher value-added products. 

This is an excellent accomplishment against the 

overcapacity situation in the country.

risks while helping our industry become more responsible 

and resilient. 

In parallel with our mapping efforts, we have been carrying 

out targeted site visits; monitoring our suppliers as part 

of risk assessment and management; and assessing their 

needs to help them upgrade their capacity to implement 

responsible practices. Our SMART SEED workshops are now 

an annual event and themes are chosen based on feedback 

and assessment of suppliers’ most pressing needs. In 2017, 

we also held a workshop for our suppliers operating near 

the Leuser Ecosystem to heighten their awareness of the 

protected status of Leuser, and how to stop sourcing palm 

oil from growers which may be operating in protected areas. 

The progress made in this area aligns with UN Sustainable 

Development Goal (SDG) 12 – Responsible Consumption 

and Production – as we try to improve the livelihoods 

of our suppliers especially small farmers while ensuring 

sustainable production.

Last year, we also made a breakthrough in long-term 

yield improvement when we launched two new planting 

materials – Eka 1 and Eka 2. These non-GMO clonal seeds, 

which can potentially produce more than 10 tonnes 

of CPO per hectare per year, are set to revolutionise 

productivity and will be rolled out progressively in our 

plantations. Eka 1 and Eka 2 are the results of our long-

held belief in investing in technology and R&amp;D to advance 

sustainable productivity, while reducing the need to open 

more land for agriculture. This puts us on track to deliver 

UN SDG 2 which aims to increase agricultural productivity 

to relieve global hunger.

We continue to make progress on other fronts including 

our innovative community conservation partnerships. 

Participatory mapping with communities continues apace 

and more villages have signed conservation agreements 

to protect over 7,000 hectares of High Carbon Stock 

(HCS) forests.

We remain vigilant against fire and in the second year 

of our collaboration with villages in Jambi and West 

Kalimantan on long-term fire prevention, we are glad 

to report that the programme has helped to reduce 

hotspots and firespots. Long-term initiatives to change 

the mindset of local communities and convince them to 

abandon the use of fire for agricultural purposes remains 

a priority for us. 

We also achieved our target of releasing 100 orangutans 

through our multi-year partnership with Orangutan 

Foundation International (OFI) last year. We are now 

exploring new ways to continue this important initiative. 

These efforts in environmental management allow us to 

deliver the goals of UN SDG 15 which aims to preserve 

Life on Land. 

Our support for the Ten Principles of the United Nations 

Global Compact and the UN SDGs has been reaffirmed by 

the participation of GAR as a signatory to the UNGC. We 

have been committed to the UNGC Principles since 2006 

when GAR’s subsidiary, SMART became a signatory of the 

UNGC and we will continue to report on our company-

wide progress through this Sustainability Report. 

As a company that firmly believes in sustainability, we are 

honoured to be named in the Dow Jones Sustainability 

Indices (Asia-Pacific), the longest established sustainability 

index in the world. We debuted in the index in 2017 

following a rigorous assessment of our Environmental, 

Social and Governance policies and practices. We are also 

proud to be a member of the SGX Sustainability Index, 

including the Sustainability Leaders Index.

ContinuouS impRovement

It is with great sadness that we report that there were 

work-related accidents which resulted in six fatalities in 

2017 and our deepest sympathies are with their families. 

Addressing this issue has become an urgent priority for us 

and we are strengthening internal systems and procedures 

in	 order	 to	 achieve	 zero	 fatalities	 and	 accidents	 in	 the	

future. 

In the similar spirit of continuous improvement, we 

asked several external parties including the Rainforest 

Alliance to assess our implementation of the GAR Social 

and Environmental Policy (GSEP). They have reported 

that in the main we are progressing and have the right 

procedures in place, but have also recommended some 

areas for improvement. We have devised action plans 

based on the findings.  

To check that we are aware of issues which impact 

our business and our stakeholders, we carried out an 

extensive materiality assessment in the second half of 

2017, reaching out to many of our stakeholders for 

feedback and input. The materiality assessment helps 

us respond to the changing business environment and 

expectations from our stakeholders. Through this, we 

have been able to map out our material issues which will 

guide our strategic planning and reporting. 

As we continue to work on our various sustainability 

initiatives, we believe that continued support from 

developed and progressive markets is crucial to sustain 

the efforts of the palm oil industry as it transitions towards 

more responsible practices. This is particularly critical for 

the millions of smallholders who depend on palm oil for 

their livelihoods and who need external markets which 

are supportive of responsibly produced palm oil.

boARD oF DiReCtoRS’ StAtement (102-14)

As the largest palm oil grower in Indonesia, GAR believes 

that socio-economic growth can go hand-in-hand with 

environmental protection and sustainable practices. 

Our sustainability strategy uses a methodical approach 

to understanding our most material issues across all 

areas of our business – this includes our impacts on the 

environment, the communities around us, our workers, our 

supply chain and the consumers who use our products. 

In 2015, we updated our policy governing sustainability 

and launched the GAR Social and Environmental 

Policy (GSEP). It covers the key economic, social and 

environmental issues facing the palm oil industry, 

and serves as the company’s main roadmap towards 

responsible palm oil production. 

Based on this policy, we have set performance improvement 

targets for our material sustainability issues. The monitoring, 

evaluation and reporting of our performance through 

our Annual and Sustainability Reports helps us track our 

progress and identify areas for improvement.

We work on achieving our goals through engagement, 

partnership and collaboration with key stakeholders 

including 

government, 

communities, 

Civil 

Society 

Organisations (CSOs) and our industry peers. Furthermore, 

we benchmark our performance against international 

and industry standards including the Roundtable on 

Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Principles and Criteria, 

the High Carbon Stock Approach (HCS) and the United 

Nations Global Compact (UNGC).

To ensure the appropriate level of oversight and 

guidance, we have established a Sustainability Committee 

comprising the senior leadership team across the 

upstream, downstream and corporate centres which 

meets regularly to oversee the development and 

implementation of GAR’s sustainability strategy. The 

Committee reports to the Chairman and CEO and 

the Board, and is a key part of GAR’s efforts to embed 

sustainability in its everyday operations.

Ultimately, we believe that our investment in responsible 

palm oil production is essential in helping our business 

thrive and create value for shareholders, our employees 

and the community.

About gAR

palm oil – an Sdg Commodity (102-15)

Palm oil is produced from the fruit of oil palms, which 

grow	 in	 fertile	 regions	 close	 to	 the	 equator.	 Oil	 is	

extracted from both the fruit and its kernel (the nut 

at its centre), producing crude palm oil, crude palm 

kernel oil and palm kernel expeller, which can be 

further refined and used in different products. 

Palm oil has the highest yield of any oil crop and 

makes more efficient use of land in its production 

than any other vegetable oils. In 2017, mature oil 

palms occupied less than seven percent of the total 

harvested area for vegetable oils. However, in the 

form of palm oil and palm kernel oil, they supplied 37 

percent of global vegetable oil production in 2017.

It is also extremely versatile, used as a cooking oil, 

in foods such as margarine and ice cream, and in 

thousands of non-food products from soaps to 

cosmetics, candles and pharmaceuticals. Palm oil 

is also a valuable biofuel, which can contribute to 

reducing carbon emissions. Palm oil’s low cost and 

versatility have resulted in rapidly growing worldwide 

demand. 

In Indonesia, palm oil production has helped to lift 

millions of rural farmers out of absolute poverty. It is 

estimated that a palm oil farmer can earn up to seven 

times more than a subsistence farmer. It provides 

direct and indirect employment for an estimated 16 

million people and generates USD23 billion worth of 

palm oil exports in 2017 for Indonesia. Palm oil estates 

also provide critical infrastructure and facilities for 

rural populations and gives them access to healthcare 

and education. Through this, palm oil is helping to 

deliver several UN SDGs including ending poverty, 

generating decent work and economic growth, 

providing	quality	education	and	health	and	wellbeing,	

and	reducing	inequalities.	

The chart below shows that palm oil not only 

produces the best yield of all commercial oil crops 

but also creates less impact in terms of fertiliser and 

pesticide usage.

GAR and SMART are not subsidiaries of Sinar Mas, as Sinar 

Mas does not refer to any operating business entity.

the SCale of ouR opeRation (102-4, 102-7)

GAR maintains its position as the leading oil palm 

plantation group in Indonesia with estates spanning the 

archipelago. 

We manage 172 oil palm estates with a total area of  

502,847	hectares.	As	at	end	2017,	the	planted	area	consists	

of estates owned by GAR (called ‘nucleus’) totaling 

399,995 hectares and estates owned by smallholders 

(called ‘plasma’) amounting to 102,852 hectares. 

The harvested FFB are processed in GAR-owned milling 

facilities, which are strategically located near the 

plantations,	 to	 produce	 CPO	 and	 PK.	 GAR	 has	 46	 mills	

with a combined installed annual capacity of 13.3 million 

tonnes of FFB. During the year, our mills produced 2.18 

million	tonnes	of	CPO	and	545	thousand	tonnes	of	PK.

the value Chain of ouR palm oil buSineSS 

(102-7)

Our palm oil business, which is mostly in Indonesia, is 

fully vertically integrated and involved in every aspect 

of palm oil production. We develop and produce oil 

palm seeds, plant and manage oil palm plantations, 

harvest and mill the fruit of the palms to create our palm 

products (CPO and PK). We then refine CPO and crush 

PK to produce higher value products such as cooking 

oil, margarine, shortening, biodiesel, oleochemicals and 

other palm oil derivative goods. We sell our products 

both in bulk to wholesalers and direct to consumers 

through some of Asia’s most popular food and cookery 

brands. In Indonesia, our products are marketed under 

our prominent brands, Filma and Kunci Mas.

We aim to offer an extensive range of products, and 

focus our R&amp;D on evolving our portfolio to meet 

customer demand. This includes consumer demand 

for	higher	quality	and	more	sustainable	palm	oil	goods.	

We also have destination processing in China and India, 

the two largest consumers of edible oils. In China, we 

produce refined vegetable oils by blending palm oil 

with soybean oil to accommodate market demand. In 

addition to that, our plants also produce value-added 

products such as margarine, shortening and butter 

oil substitute. In India, we own refinery plants and 

established brand in the eastern part of the country, 

supported by an extensive distribution system. 

Our palm oil business contributes to the performance 

of Plantations and Palm Oil Mills as well as Palm and 

Laurics segments (see page 133 of GAR Annual Report 

2017	 Note	 42	 “Operating	 Segment	 Information”	 for	

further details).

the value Chain of ouR oilSeedS and otheRS 

buSineSS (102-7)

In China, GAR owns integrated vegetable oil facilities 

comprising oilseed storage, crushing and refining 

facilities, and one of the country’s largest deep-sea 

ports. Through our deep-sea port operation in Ningbo, 

Zhejiang	Province,	we	import	and	store	oils	and	grains,	

including refined palm oil from our own operations in 

Indonesia and soybean. Our oilseed crushing facilities 

in Ningbo and Tianjin produce soybean meal to be sold 

within China, and crude soybean oil that is, in turn, 

processed by the refineries together with other edible 

oils including palm oil. 

In November 2017, we entered into a conditional 

agreement to divest our subsidiary, Sinarmas Natural 

Resources Foodstuff Technology (Tianjin) Co., Ltd, 

that owns and operates oilseeds crushing and refining 

facilities in Tianjin. The divestment was completed 

in April 2018. This initiative is part of our strategy of 

refocusing our business model for our China oilseed 

division.

GAR also operates a food business in China through 

Florentina 

International 

Holdings 

Limited, 

which 

manufactures and distributes a variety of economy 

and premium grade snack noodle and instant noodle 

products, and other snack products in the country.

This business contributes to the performance of 

Oilseeds and Other segments (see page 133 of GAR 

Annual	 Report	 2017	 Note	 42	 “Operating	 Segment	

Information”	for	further	details).

balanCing SuStainability with StRategiC 

gRowth oppoRtunitieS (102-10)

To sustain our long-term growth, we continue to study 

the potential for oil palm plantations in other countries. 

We	 are	 investing	 in	 Africa	 through	 The	 Verdant	 Fund	

LP,	 a	 private	 equity	 fund	 that	 owns	 Golden	 Veroleum	

(Liberia)	 Inc	 (GVL).	 The	 Liberian	 government	 has	

granted	GVL	a	concession	to	develop	land	for	oil	palm	

plantations. The GSEP applies to all GAR investments 

and	 as	 such	 GVL	 follows	 sustainable	 development	

practices	as	laid	out	in	the	policy.	GVL	is	also	a	member	

of the RSPO and adheres to its Principles and Criteria. 

As	at	end	of	2017,	GVL	cultivated	approximately	16,800	

hectares of oil palm plantations, with GAR providing 

technical	expertise	to	ensure	quality	and	sustainability.

ouR finanCial peRfoRmanCe in 2017 (102-7)

During 2017, GAR posted a revenue of over USD7.5 

billion, four percent higher than the previous year. EBITDA 

grew by 16 percent to USD665 million whilst underlying 

profit	increased	by	36	percent	to	reach	USD254	million.

This strong performance was on the back of the 

recovery in palm product output. With adjusted net 

debt	to	equity	ratio	of	0.42	times	and	total	consolidated	

assets of USD8.1 billion as at 31 December 2017, GAR’s 

financial position continues to strengthen. 

We are also confident about the long-term prospects 

of palm oil. As world population and income per capita 

continue to rise, food production needs to double in 

order	 to	 secure	 adequate	 food	 supplies.	 With	 limited	

agricultural land, the target of producing more food 

with less area will play a vital part in sustainable 

agriculture. Palm oil is the best candidate to fulfil 

this demand, especially with the upcoming industry 

replanting that is expected to double current yields. 

Apart from food usage, oleochemicals and biodiesel 

will also continue to provide additional demand for 

palm oil as a feedstock.

hoW We AppRoACh ReSponSible pAlm oil

how we appRoaCh ReSponSible palm oil 

(102-11, 102-12)

As an agribusiness, GAR understands the crucial 

importance of careful and responsible stewardship of 

natural resources. As a company that provides jobs for 

tens of thousands of people and which operates near 

and around thousands of villages, we are also keenly 

aware	of	the	necessity	of	being	a	good	corporate	citizen	

and neighbour. These tenets underpin our approach to 

achieving responsible palm oil production. 

Since we adopted the first Forest Conservation Policy 

in the palm oil industry in 2011, we have continued 

to make strides in moving towards responsible palm 

oil production and we seek to encourage the rest of 

the industry to adopt responsible practices through 

engagement and dialogue. 

Our roadmap for achieving this is the GAR Social and 

Environmental Policy or the GSEP. Launched in 2015, the 

policy consolidates all our sustainability related policies 

in one document. It contains our commitments for 

our most material sustainability issues and our overall 

approach to ensuring their responsible management. 

The GSEP embodies our belief that economic growth, 

social progress and environmental protection can go 

hand-in-hand. 

We also keep up with emerging concerns and trends 

globally and locally and strive to incorporate these in 

our approach to responsible production. One such 

example is our alignment of our ongoing initiatives with 

the UN SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). 

 

We are focussing on three SDGs which we believe align 

best with our strengths as a company. These are also 

areas where we see the most opportunities for further 

growth and development. These SDGs include UN SDG 

2	–	Zero	Hunger,	SDG	12	–	Responsible	Consumption	

and Production and SDG 15 – Life on Land. All these 

are supported by local and global partnerships – the 

goal of UN SDG 17. 

Even as we continue to implement our initiatives 

and projects which help us achieve successful forest 

conservation and environmental management, we are 

also proactively trying to transform our supply chain. 

Through our deepening engagement with our supply 

chain initiated by our traceability exercises, we are 

actively trying to influence and encourage our suppliers, 

and by extension the rest of the industry, to adopt 

responsible	practices	(see	section	on	“Marketplace	and	

Supply	Chain”).

management appRoaCh to ReSponSible  

palm oil (102-18, 102-19, 102-20, 102-21)

The Board and Senior Management are fully involved 

in and supports GAR’s sustainability efforts and 

commitments under the GSEP and have stated this 

in the Board of Directors’ Statement. A Sustainability 

Committee (SC) which is chaired by Ms. Jesslyne Widjaja, 

Corporate Strategy and Business Development Director, 

oversees all matters related to responsible palm oil. 

The SC comprises the senior leadership team from the 

upstream; downstream; and corporate business units; 

as well as the Head of the Sustainability and Strategic 

Stakeholder Engagement Department and other staff 

members from the department. It reports directly to  

Mr. Franky O. Widjaja, Chairman and CEO of GAR, and the 

Board, and meets regularly to oversee the development 

and implementation of the GSEP and the monitoring of 

performance across all our business operations. Aside 

from these meetings, urgent and developing issues are 

escalated to relevant SC members for their input and 

decisions.

 

Over the years we have continued to invest additional 

resources with the aim of embedding responsible 

practices in our day-to-day operations. The Sustainability 

and Strategic Stakeholder Engagement Department has 

over 300 staff working in Jakarta and in the field. 

As detailed in the organisation charts, we employ 

specialists to oversee and handle key areas such 

as	 conflict	 resolution,	 HCS/HCV	 management,	 fire	

prevention, community consent (FPIC), grievance 

management and health and safety. The department 

also works with colleagues in Human Resources on 

labour issues to ensure free and fair labour practices in 

line with the GSEP.

ReSponSible handling of ComplaintS and 

gRievanCeS (102-17) 

In 2015, GAR established a Grievance Procedure to ensure 

that as a company, we are responsive to any grievances 

raised by external parties which may involve our third-

party suppliers. It helps us to address a wide range of 

concerns, including those related to our most material 

issues, and covers our worldwide operations. 

During 2017, six grievances were raised with GAR and of 

these we have closed two cases. We also resolved and 

closed two earlier grievances. GAR is actively reviewing 

and working towards a resolution with stakeholders on 

all ongoing grievances. The full list and details of our 

grievances is updated regularly and can be viewed on  

the GAR Sustainability Dashboard.

surveys. These include a study by Business for Social 

Responsibility (BSR) on our labour practices. The 

Rainforest Alliance has also carried out a verification 

study on the implementation of the GSEP in 2017. We 

have also engaged EY to work with us on our Carbon 

Footprint Assessment Project, which will help us 

establish and verify baseline measurements of GHG 

emissions and formulate strategies for reduction. 

These are just some of the external assessments that 

are helping us monitor our progress and take the right 

steps to improve our responsible practices whether it 

be in conservation, human rights, labour practices or 

social and community engagement. Action plans based 

on these independent assessments of our performance 

have been formulated and are being implemented.

We maintain and regularly update our Sustainability 

Dashboard which is freely accessible by all stakeholders 

on our website without a separate login. We regularly 

report our progress on several key initiatives such as our 

Traceability to Plantation (TTP) exercise, our progress 

in resolving and handling grievances, fire incidents and 

wider sustainability efforts on the GAR website and 

Sustainability Dashboard as well as in reports such as the 

GAR Annual Report and the GAR Sustainability Report. 

SCientifiC appRoaCh to ReSponSible palm oil

Our approach to responsible palm oil production is 

underpinned by scientific research and development 

and the use of technological advances. Our flagship 

research facility SMARTRI conducts research to 

develop ground breaking improvements in yields and 

productivity sustainably – minimising impacts on the 

environment and the people who work and live on our 

plantations. With extreme weather phenomena such as 

El Niño becoming more severe, SMARTRI also conducts 

research into developing more resilient non-GMO seed 

stock and improving agronomic practices to cope with 

the impact of climate change.

We are also committed to safeguarding consumer health 

and our R&amp;D department is reformulating processed 

products to be completely transfat-free as well as 

carrying out measures to reduce co-contaminants in 

processed palm oil. 

paRtneRShipS foR ReSponSible palm oil 

All	 these	 endeavours	 require	 us	 to	 work	 closely	

and engage with multiple stakeholders. Partnership 

(UN SDG 17) is the cornerstone of our approach to 

achieving our goals. We do this in recognition of our 

limits as a private company and we seek to learn and 

gain valuable feedback from our stakeholders such as 

local communities, smallholder farmers, government, 

CSOs, suppliers, the RSPO, our industry peers and 

implementation partners. Our sustainability journey 

would not be possible without constant engagement, 

dialogue and consultation with our key stakeholders. 

 

In several instances, we have worked with CSO 

stakeholders 

like 

Greenpeace 

to 

develop 

new 

guidelines and standards such as the High Carbon Stock 

Approach (HCSA) to address deforestation concerns. 

This approach is increasingly being adopted not only in 

our industry but also in other sectors such as forestry.

The GSEP was developed with feedback and input from 

key stakeholders including CSOs such as Greenpeace, 

Rainforest Action Network (RAN), Forest Peoples 

Programme (FPP) and our implementation partner, 

The Forest Trust (TFT). We also continue to improve 

our Standard Operational Procedures for carrying 

out FPIC, handling grievances, conflict resolution and 

participatory mapping, often with input from external 

stakeholders such as CSOs.

the RainfoReSt allianCe aSSeSSment of ouR gSep implementation

In 2016, GAR approached the Rainforest Alliance to conduct an objective evaluation of the implementation of 

the GSEP which was launched in 2015, and built on previous sustainability policies. Three concessions in West 

Kalimantan were picked as evaluation sites – PT. Kartika Prima Cipta (KPC), PT. Paramitra Internusa Pratama (PIP) 

and PT. Persada Graha Mandiri (PGM). The concessions were chosen because they are the areas where GAR has 

trialled and delivered the most work related to its GSEP since the policy was implemented. 

The evaluation was conducted using established, independent auditing procedures, including evidence submissions 

by GAR and other stakeholders, field visits and stakeholder consultations with affected communities, individuals 

and organisations. 

key findings include:  

Across the 17 mills, 18 estates and 12 smallholders assessed, all faced challenges in fulfilling most of the principles 

set forth in the GSEP due to: 

•	

GAR	has	developed	a	series	of	Standard	Operating	Procedures	(SOPs)	and	concession	managers	are	consistently	

working to implement them 

•	

GAR	has	halted	forest	clearance;	is	working	with	affected	communities	both	inside	and	outside	the	concessions	

to	control	fires;	carried	out	High	Conservation	Value	(HCV)	and	High	Carbon	Stock	(HCS)	assessments;	and	

conserved	both	HCVs	and	HCS	in	the	three	concessions

•	

GAR	has	identified	social	conflicts	and	is	using	existing	SOPs	and	related	processes	for	achieving	resolution.	

Continuous improvement in FPIC implementation is critical

•	

GAR	has	created	a	functioning	supply	chain	traceability	approach

GAR operates in a continuously changing sustainability 

landscape. The principle of materiality is important as it 

helps us to identify and prioritise the sustainability topics 

and issues that shape our success as a business and that 

matter most to our stakeholders. 

Our 

assessment 

of 

material 

issues 

informs 

our 

sustainability strategy and management approach. It also 

informs our reporting on sustainability to ensure that 

we are being transparent and responsive to stakeholder 

interests and concerns. To see how we are managing our 

most material issues please refer to the Targets and UN 

SDGs table on page 2-7. 

In 2017, we conducted an in-depth materiality assessment 

across our entire value chain, including how stakeholder 

perspectives are changing and how macro trends and 

events are impacting our business. This exercise, described 

in detail below, built on our previous assessment in 2015. 

The result of the assessment is a prioritised list of 19 

sustainability issues presented in our materiality matrix. 

These are also described in detail with regards to the 

impact they have across our value chain in the table 

below. 

The identified material issues were reviewed and 

signed-off by the GAR Sustainability Committee, before 

being presented to our Board of Directors prior to the 

publication of this report.

ouR 2017 mateRiality aSSeSSment pRoCeSS

To ensure a best practice approach and objectivity, the 

assessment was supported by Corporate	Citizenship – a 

global business consultancy specialising in sustainability. 

The process was designed to meet the principle of 

materiality as set out in the GRI Standards. It included an 

in-depth analysis of business impacts across our entire 

value chain and gathering a balance of internal and 

external perspectives to prioritise the issues. The three-

stage process is detailed below:

1. issue identification 

 

We conducted a review of the existing material issues 

and desk based research into emerging sustainability 

trends, macro forces and competitor practices. We 

also	 looked	 at	 requirements	 from	 various	 global	

standards and frameworks including RSPO Principles 

and Criteria, the UN SDGs, sustainability ratings (such 

as	 the	 Dow	 Jones	 Sustainability	 Index,	 FTSE4Good,	

SPOTT	 and	 Sustainalytics),	 questionnaires	 from	

financiers and customers, and the Sustainability 

Accounting Standards Board’s (SASB) Materiality Map. 

We identified a long list of 177 sustainability issues. 

 

This long list was then consolidated, combining 

related issues and removing any issues deemed 

immaterial, through a working session with Corporate 

Citizenship.	The	outcome	was	a	shortlist	of	19	issues	

to take forward to our stakeholders for engagement 

and prioritisation. 

2. Stakeholder engagement and issue prioritisation

 

A balance of internal and external perspectives was 

gathered,	through	a	mix	of	qualitative	and	quantitative	

methods, including surveys and interviews.

 

Current or potential impact on the business (X-axis) 

was determined by surveying internal stakeholders 

from across different functions and at different 

levels. The survey received a total of 52 responses, 

ensuring a holistic view of sustainability at GAR was 

captured. Survey responses were supplemented with 

a series of management interviews across a range of 

business functions (including Sustainability, Corporate 

Communications, Finance, Commercial Products, 

Consumer Products, Supply Chain, R&amp;D, Investor 

Relations, 

Stakeholder 

Engagement) 

to 

gather 

additional	qualitative	and	contextual	information.	

 

Importance to stakeholders (Y-axis) was determined, 

by surveying external stakeholders, including business 

partners, certification bodies, CSOs, consumers, 

customers, governments/regulators, investors/lenders/ 

financial institutions, media, suppliers and palm 

associations. The survey was sent to over 300 

stakeholders and received 79 responses. In addition, 

eight in-depth interviews were conducted with 

a subset of these stakeholders (banks/lenders, 

customers, CSOs, specialist sustainability media) to 

gather	further	qualitative	information	and	context	on	

their views.

 

Following data collection and analysis, the prioritisation 

exercise resulted in two scores for each issue – one 

for current or potential impact on the business and 

one for importance to stakeholders. These were 

plotted on a draft matrix.

3. Validation and sign-off 

 

The draft matrix, along with a management report 

detailing the insights gathered through the process, 

was presented to senior management and the 

sustainability teams for validation and approval 

through two consultative workshops held at GAR’s 

offices in Singapore and Jakarta.

 

Following the internal validation, the final materiality 

matrix was presented to GAR’s Sustainability Committee 

for sign off presentation to the Board of Directors. 

4. outputs

 

The results of the materiality assessment confirmed 

that there is strong alignment between our most 

material issues and those which are addressed 

through the GSEP. It also highlighted some changes 

in the importance of issues since 2015, including the 

increased emphasis stakeholders are placing on social 

issues relating to workers across our value chain. The 

insights gathered, including any gaps in policy and 

procedure, has been conveyed to management teams 

along with recommendations for improvement. As 

such, this will inform the ongoing development of 

GAR’s overall sustainability strategy and management 

approach with regards to specific issues. 

 

The results of our materiality assessment have also 

informed the development of this report, to ensure 

that we are being responsive to stakeholder interests 

and concerns. We have focused the report on the 

most material issues identified and tried to ensure that 

there is full disclosure on these issues to meet external 

expectations.

Stakeholder engagement (102-13, 102-40, 102-42, 

102-43, 102-44)

We take a proactive approach to stakeholder engagement.  

Through a stakeholder mapping exercise, we have 

identified the stakeholder groups that are fundamental 

to the sustainability of our operations, and which have 

a significant interest in the impact of our material 

sustainability topics. We adopt a tailored approach to 

ensure regular engagement with each of these groups.

We operate in a dynamic industry and our understanding 

of our most important stakeholders continuously 

evolves to reflect this. We constantly review the way we 

communicate with our stakeholders.

In 2017, we reached out to hundreds of our stakeholders 

for feedback on our material issues.  Our stakeholders 

responded positively and candidly to the assessment, 

and we have used their input to update our material 

issues. Through the exercise, we also gathered and 

noted additional feedback on GAR (see “Our materiality 

assessment”).

ouR palm Supply Chain (102-9, 103-1, 204-1)

The bulk of our procurement comprises crude palm oil 

(CPO) and palm kernel (PK) for our downstream business 

in Indonesia. In 2017, these raw materials  were sourced 

from	 427	 third-party	 mills	 and	 441 GAR-owned mills 

in Indonesia. The feedstock for the mills or fresh fruit 

bunches (FFB) are in turn supplied by our own nucleus 

estates, third-party estates, thousands of individual 

farmers (plasma and independent), as well as brokers and 

agents who buy from farmers. Procurement of CPO and 

PK, and procurement of FFB, accounts for around 78 and 

nine percent respectively of our Indonesian subsidiaries’ 

procurement of products and services.

As the palm supply chain represents our key supply 

chain, risks which are normally associated with the palm 

oil industry apply to our main supply chain.

Aside from our palm supply chain, we procure a number 

of other products and services to run our business. Of our 

non-palm procurement, our most significant spend for 

our upstream operations is on fertilisers sourced from 35 

Indonesian companies, which accounted for 31 percent 

of procurement spend. Other procurement spend 

categories include materials, spare parts and services; 

fuel and tires; food; and tools and consumables. Over 60 

percent of these products and services are sourced from 

local vendors and suppliers mostly based in and around 

our plantations and plants with the rest from national 

suppliers.	 We	 support	 many	 small-sized	 businesses	

and suppliers with 80 percent of our total vendors are 

categorised	as	small-sized	businesses2.

ShaRing ReSponSible pRaCtiCeS and 

tRanSfoRming ouR palm Supply Chain 

(103-1, 103-2)

One of our main commitments under the GSEP is to bring 

our supply chain along on our journey towards responsible 

palm oil. We believe we can and need to help create a 

better industry overall as we continue improving our own 

implementation of responsible palm oil practices.

In 2017, we hit a significant milestone when we achieved 

100 percent Traceability to the Plantation (TTP) for all 

GAR-owned mills. This means 39 percent of our palm 

supply chain is now fully traceable. This achievement 

builds on our mapping and engagement efforts which 

began	 in	 2014	 when	 we	 extended	 our	 commitment	 to	

cover all our suppliers and achieved full Traceability to the 

Mill in 2015. 

helping ouR Supply Chain aChieve full 

tRaCeability (103-2)

Our experience in achieving TTP for our own mills will 

help us assist our third-party suppliers implement TTP 

processes of their own and report TTP by end 2020.

GAR is working with a network of partners to support 

third-party suppliers establish tracing and verification 

processes. One such partner is Geotraceability (GeoT), 

which uses its software solutions to assist suppliers, 

including	 small	 and	 medium	 sized	 mills,	 in	 compiling	

traceability information. GAR and GeoT have developed an 

inclusive approach to improve supply chain transparency, 

which allows all suppliers to join regardless of their 

current level of supplier knowledge.

We are also partnering with Koltiva which helps verify 

sustainably sourced commodities from independent 

smallholders with leading web and mobile applications. 

As of end 2017, Koltiva Field Agents have registered 16 

palm oil brokers and agents, mapped and verified over 

9,000 hectares of plantation owned or managed by 

over	4,000	farmers.	Through	this	process,	farmers	have	

also been provided with information to help improve 

their production, farming practices and livelihood, 

and support their access to international supply chain 

markets.

ttp layS the foundation foR Supply Chain 

tRanSfoRmation (103-2, 103-3, 308-1, 308-2, 414-1, 414-2)

TTP enables us to guarantee the origin of our raw 

materials to our customers. Understanding where our raw 

materials come from is just a first step. Beyond this, TTP 

helps us minimise supply chain risks because it allows us 

to deepen knowledge, awareness, trust and engagement 

with our suppliers, while helping them improve their 

responsible practices. 

 

Full TTP for GAR-owned mills means that (aside from 

our own nucleus estate and plasma smallholders) we 

mapped and can now reach out to more than 70 dealers/

brokers who buy from 11,000 smallholders managing 

over	 40,000	 hectares	 of	 plantations.	 As	 TTP	 progresses	

for our third-party supplier mills, we will be able to extend 

our engagement to more dealers and smallholders in the 

industry. 

Our engagement and supplier support process is time and 

labour-intensive and includes site visits, special training 

and workshops as well as specifically designed remedial 

action plans where needed. We have continued with 

our systematic programme of site visits to our suppliers 

in 2017. Since 2015, we have conducted 79 visits to 73 

supplier	mills;	in	2017	alone,	we	carried	out	48	visits	to	

41	suppliers	(with	some	mills	visited	more	than	once	for	

2 Defined as vendors with contracts under IDR1 billion

different compliance assessments). These visits help us 

gauge how well aligned they are with the responsible 

practices spelled out in the GSEP. 

 

Reports on site visits to the suppliers in the Belawan 

Refinery and Tarahan Refinery areas are published on our 

Sustainability Dashboard. 

 

The resulting analysis of our suppliers’ situations enables 

us to design appropriate support and intervention 

strategies. Key findings from these visits include the 

need to tackle the lack of understanding of responsible 

practices and the need to build capacity to adopt those 

practices.

Aside from scheduled visits, we also carry out ad hoc site 

visits as part of our grievance handling process when an 

issue is raised by an external stakeholder or discovered 

through our own issues monitoring. Our engagement is 

reported in our Grievance List and case studies, which 

highlight action plans for our suppliers are published 

on our website and Sustainability Dashboard. In 2017,  

six new grievances were raised and two resolved. We 

continue to work with all stakeholders to resolve open 

cases. 

A dedicated GAR Supplier Support Team is available to 

respond to queries from suppliers. The members of the 

team have different backgrounds and expertise in areas 

such environmental assurance, law and traceability and 

are a great resource for our suppliers as they seek to 

comply with the commitments laid out in the GSEP.

key findings:  

Across the 17 mills, 18 estates and 12 smallholders assessed, all faced challenges in fulfilling most of the principles 

set forth in the GSEP due to: 

•	

Lack	of	understanding	of	sustainability	as	a	strategic	asset.	Suppliers	had	yet	to	fully	embrace	sustainability	as	a	

key differentiator in the market place and link their organisation’s values to triple bottom line concerns: social, 

environmental and financial. 

•	

Absence	of	sustainability	systems	and	policies.	Whilst	suppliers	had	developed	some	procedures	related	to	

sustainability, they were often developed merely to pursue compliance with regulation or other acceptable 

norms. 

•	

Limited	structural	organisational	support.	Lack	of	internal	leadership	to	catalyse	and	integrate	sustainability	

within their organisation has prevented suppliers from adopting a clear vision and necessary focus to embrace 

sustainability.

To assist suppliers to comply with the GSEP, GAR in collaboration with suppliers, TFT and related stakeholders 

are collaborating in transformation programmes that support suppliers to adopt sustainability practices. They 

will also work together on monitoring and evaluations. GAR will lead broad and deep engagement initiatives to 

enable suppliers to systematise sustainability practices within their business management and operations. Broad 

engagement initiatives such as SMART SEED will target all suppliers in the supply shed, whilst deep engagement 

initiatives will target suppliers who have already been visited.

next steps: 

To assist suppliers to comply with the GSEP, GAR will be leading broad and deep engagement initiatives to 

enable suppliers to systematise sustainability practices within their business management and operations. Broad 

engagement such as SMART SEED will target all suppliers in the supply shed, whilst deep engagement initiatives 

will target suppliers who have already been visited. 

GAR will make available the following support mechanisms for suppliers:

•	

SMART	SEED	held	annually	to	provide	a	platform	for	suppliers	to	reflect	on	strategic	sustainability	issues	and	

participate in technical training sessions that will support suppliers to improve their social and environmental 

performance towards compliance with the GSEP. 

•	

Create	 Toolkits	 and	 Templates	 on	 SMART	 website	 that	 can	 be	 replicated	 and	 integrated	 into	 suppliers’	

own	business	processes	related	to	legal	compliance,	peat	management,	HCV,	HCS,	environmental	impact	

management, Occupational Health and Safety, Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) and traceability. 

•	

SMART	LEAF	(Learning,	Engagement	and	Action	Forum)	and	SMART	SPOT	(Sustainable	Palm	Oil	Training).	GAR	

to conduct training and technical workshop to promote and facilitate learning for suppliers on topics related 

to	legal	compliance,	ISPO,	peat	management,	environmental	impact	management,	HCV,	HCS,	social	impact,	

CSR, sexual abuse and harassment, grievance, conflict management, Occupational Health and Safety, FPIC and 

traceability. 

•	

Collaboration	 for	 Transformation	 (CFT)	 with	 targeted	 suppliers	 to	 support	 sustainability	 practices	 and	 find	

solutions together. 

•	

GAR	is	improving	supplier	risk	assessment	especially	in	determining	problems	or	issues	in	industrial	relations	

and occupational safety and health. GAR will start this process in areas which supply the most CPO and PK and 

progress to other areas. 

To monitor and evaluate the progress of suppliers’ transformation journey, suppliers will be assessed annually 

through follow-up visits and supplier self-assessments. This approach was launched prior to the publication of 

this report and GAR will be collecting feedback from its suppliers. GAR will also roll out thematic surveys geared 

towards issues in which suppliers are most challenged. Thematic surveys will assist GAR to better understand 

how its interventions are supporting suppliers to integrate sustainability into their business management and 

improve their practices in the field. Success stories of suppliers’ transformation journeys will also be published 

by GAR to further inspire and create synergies within its supply base and accelerate collaborations in finding 

practical solutions. GAR hopes and expects that together with their suppliers, they will be able to progress towards 

implementing responsible palm oil practices at scale.

Additionally, we organise annual SMART SEED (Social 

and Environmental Excellence Development) workshops 

for our suppliers. These workshops allow us to share 

best practices and facilitate exchanges with other key 

stakeholders such as government agencies and NGOs. 

The themes for the workshop are based on feedback 

and input from our suppliers and have included labour 

practices, 

traceability 

and 

achieving 

Indonesian 

Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) certification. The workshops 

generate much interest amongst our suppliers and attract 

many active participants. In 2017, the workshop was 

attended by 200 participants. 

We also run other training as needed and in 2017, we held 

a workshop for our suppliers operating near the Leuser 

Ecosystem to heighten their awareness of the protected 

status of Leuser, and how to stop sourcing palm oil from 

growers which may be operating in protected areas.

In 2017, we assessed 19 suppliers for environmental 

impacts and 39 suppliers for social impacts. These 

suppliers were chosen for assessment based on criteria 

such as reports of deforestation or reports of land or 

social disputes in the area, amongst other things.

 

All suppliers assessed carried significant actual or 

potential risks in their operations. We found that the 

environmental risks associated with our suppliers were 

mostly	around	the	clearance	of	HCV,	HCS	and	peat	areas.	

Social impacts were predominantly related to human 

rights, including child labour, as well as community and 

land tenure disputes. As a result, we have been working 

with all of them to develop improvement plans going 

forward. 

We believe that we can best trigger a change in our 

supply chain through sustained engagement with 

our suppliers. Suppliers who are participating in the 

assessment process are generally receptive to our 

proposals for improvement – this is evident from the 

fact that we have not had to disengage from any of the 

suppliers that we have assessed. 

Nevertheless, 

we 

have 

the 

option 

of 

halting 

procurement from suppliers who do not comply 

with the GSEP and other GAR policies. Since 2015, 

GAR has stopped purchasing from over 130 suppliers 

who did not comply with GSEP, traceability or other 

procurement	requirements	such	as	product	quality.	

foSteRing ReSponSible pRoduCtion amongSt 

SmallholdeRS

Smallholders are an essential part of our supply chain and 

crucial stakeholders in our sustainability journey as there 

are an estimated two million small farmers controlling 

over	44	percent	of	palm	oil	estates	in	Indonesia.

With the achievement of full TTP for GAR-owned mills, 

we have increased our ability to share responsible 

practices with the thousands of smallholders in our 

supply chain.

GAR has supported the plasma smallholder scheme 

since 1990 and there are currently over 69,000 plasma 

smallholders in our concessions. They supplied about 

22 percent of our total intake of FFB in 2017.

At GAR, we have a policy of supporting all (100 percent) 

of our plasma smallholders. While GAR does not own 

the plasma plantations, they are very closely integrated 

into our management system and we take the lead 

in promoting their success and productivity. In 2017, 

our	 smallholders	 achieved	 a	 CPO	 yield	 of	 around	 4.6	

tonnes per hectare, which is among the highest in the 

industry in Indonesia.

Through their partnership with us, we provide our 

plasma smallholders with high-yielding seeds and good 

quality	 fertilisers.	 We	 also	 ensure	 knowledge	 transfer	

and capacity building through regular training on Good 

Agricultural Practices (GAP). 



41

SuStAinAbility 

RepoRt 

2017


At the same time, we recognise the importance of 

supporting independent small farmers. These independent 

farmers with small plots generally achieve very low yields 

and	have	lower	incomes	as	they	do	not	use	good	quality	

seeds and lack knowledge of best agronomic practices. 

This also curtails their ability to fully adopt responsible 

palm practices. 

Inefficient production is a concern because of its 

negative impact on a farmer’s livelihood which can lead 

to increased pressure to clear more forests for agriculture 

in the hopes of boosting earnings. 

One of the ways in which we continue to tackle this is 

through our support of the Innovative Financing scheme 

for independent smallholders. The programme aims to 

encourage more independent smallholders to replant 

with	better	quality,	higher-yielding	seed	by	giving	them	

access to financing and helping them sustain their 

livelihoods during the four years it takes for the new 

seedlings to mature. 

Since	 the	 scheme	 began	 in	 2014,	 GAR	 has	 helped	

independent farmers in Riau and Jambi secure loans of 

approximately IDR167.5 billion from state-owned banks. 

As at end 2017, over 730 farmers are participating in the 

scheme. 

We also run other finance and support programmes for 

independent smallholders. Through the Smallholders 

Development Programme, GAR has provided technical 

assistance and long tenure interest-free credit to more 

than 3,800 independent farmers in East Kalimantan since 

2013 in an area covering over 7,700 hectares. They also 

have access to high-yielding seeds, fertiliser, herbicides 

and	 heavy	 equipment	 rental,	 all	 at	 below	 market	 rates.	

To date, we have disbursed more than IDR19 billion in 

interest-free loans.

GAR is also partnering with customers on several 

projects aimed at helping the transformation of the 

palm oil industry. In March 2017, GAR, Neste and SPKS 

(Smallholders Association) agreed to work together on a 

project to identify and map up to 3,000 smallholders in 

14	 villages	 in	 Siak,	 Riau,	 a	 province	 where	 independent	

smallholders manage up to 25 percent of total planted 

area. The project aims to help them achieve sustainable 

palm oil certification. It will also identify potential 

candidates for the Innovative Financing scheme. GAR and 

its partners will also work with smallholders to address 

vulnerabilities that emerge from their assessments.

To	 date,	 over	 740	 farmers	 have	 been	 mapped	 in	 six	

villages. While mapping continues in the rest of the 

villages, we and our partners will help the smallholders 

set up farmer cooperatives. 

In another partnership, GAR, Nestle and TFT are 

collaborating on a project which seeks to empower small 

farmers and improve their resilience. Using interviews 

and Participatory Mapping involving dealers, agents, 

independent smallholders, their families and their workers, 

the project seeks to understand the smallholders’ farming 

systems, household economics, challenges and needs. 

To date, three villages are being mapped and nearly 60 

farmers have been involved in Land Tenure studies and 

Participatory Mapping.

We are also collaborating with BASF on Innovative 

Financing where BASF will provide the four-year stipend 

for farmers enrolled in the scheme. This collaboration will 

support	two	cooperatives	and	target	nearly	400	hectares	

for replanting in Riau.

Our efforts to help our supply chain, including 

smallholders, 

adopt

poliCieS (102-17)

The GSEP applies to all our suppliers and we ensure 

that this is clearly communicated to all suppliers upon 

contracting with us. We have been sharing the GSEP 

through workshops and trainings for our palm supply 

chain, as our most critical suppliers. All palm suppliers 

can	 also	 reach	 out	 with	 questions	 on	 compliance	 to	

the GAR Supplier Support Team (supplier.support@ 

sinarmas-agri.com).

Our Supplier Code of Conduct was launched in 2015. 

As	a	key	requirement	of	the	Code,	suppliers	seeking	to	

become GAR suppliers have to acknowledge that they are 

aware of and understand the GSEP. A link to our Supplier 

Code of Conduct is included in all purchase orders. Our 

existing suppliers have also submitted Codes of Conduct 

to show they are aligned with our policies. 

We operate a transparent and accountable system where 

stakeholders can inform us of issues within our supply 

chain using our grievance process. This is documented on 

the GAR Sustainability Dashboard, allowing us to respond 

in a timely and transparent manner. (See GAR Grievance 

Procedure page 23).

an assessment of four supplier mills and one smallholder. 

We will publish more information on the assessment as

SuppoRting ComplianCe with lawS and 

RegulationS 

GAR provides guidance and advice on invoicing, proper 

documentation and tax compliance for our suppliers.

We	 conduct	 training	 on	 Indonesian	 tax	 requirements	

and encourage suppliers and contractors to register for 

tax	 when	 required.	 We	 assign	 employees	 to	 work	 with	

our local contractors and ensure that they prepare their 

invoices properly, avoiding the risk of non-compliance 

and ensuring that there are no delays in payment. 

We audit certain categories of suppliers, especially those 

supplying packaging and raw materials for our products, 

to ensure that they comply with food safety standards.

Any supplier that breaches Indonesian law, including 

those pertaining to health and safety, will have their 

contract terminated immediately. 

enSuRing faiR and ethiCal tReatment of 

SupplieRS 

We are committed to dealing fairly and ethically with 

all our suppliers. We choose our suppliers based on 

legitimate, business-related criteria, not on personal 

relationships or interests. This includes criteria such as 

quality	 of	 products	 and	 services,	 cost,	 reliability	 and	

experience,	among	others.	We	require	that	all	potential	

suppliers meet the same basic legal and commercial 

requirements,	complying	with	tax	regulations	and	the	law,	

and have a Certification of Competence for the type of 

business they are conducting.

Unless otherwise agreed, our payment terms are within 

30 days of receipt of a complete and proper invoice. 

When suppliers present invoices at our head office, 

we check for completeness and accuracy, so that the 

supplier can make the necessary corrections promptly 

and resubmit the documents. Our downstream business 

has	implemented	a	“One-Day	Service”	to	notify	suppliers	

within	24	hours	if	their	invoice	is	incomplete	or	inaccurate.

This demonstrates our commitment to pay our suppliers 

on time and their importance to our business. We 

understand that some of our small suppliers in rural areas 

face challenges in managing their cash flow. To help 

them, we grant cash advances and expedite payments on 

a case-by-case basis. 

Revenue by geographical location in 2017

ouR CuStomeRS (102-2, 102-6)

The bulk of our palm oil is distributed through our 

customers, 

which 

include 

traders, 

distributors, 

wholesalers, retailers as well as other businesses in the 

food and manufacturing industries that use our oil as 

a raw material in the production of secondary goods. 

Palm oil is an extremely versatile raw material used to 

make many daily products ranging from cooking oil to 

household cleaners – view the wide range of products 

on our website.

We sell our products across the world, deriving the bulk of 

our revenue from markets in Asia. 

Revenue based on geographical location of customers is 

as follows:

We deal directly with our industrial customers and we 

maintain regular communication with them, ensuring 

we	 tailor	 our	 products	 to	 their	 requirements.	 Our	

responsibilities to these customers include fair pricing 

and transparent processes, traceability, as well as efficient 

distribution. 

We aim to offer an extensive range of products that meet 

the varying needs of our different customers. In recent 

years this has involved extending our product range into 

high-value areas such as palm-based oleochemicals, 

which are used to manufacture soaps, detergents and 

other personal care products.

GAR is also proactively responding to the growing market 

demand for traceable and certified sustainable palm oil.

tRading with ouR CuStomeRS 

We use standardised contracts for pricing and trading our 

products, which are issued by trade associations such 

as The Federation of Oils, Seeds and Fats Associations 

Ltd (FOSFA) and The Palm Oil Refiners Association of 

Malaysia (PORAM). These contracts set the terms of 

trading, including how payment is made. When we trade 

palm oil on the wholesale market, we use the crude palm 

oil price as the basis of our negotiations with brokers 

or customers. We offer the option of spot or forward 

market prices. All buyers are assessed to ensure that they 

are	 financially	 solvent	 and	 we	 require	 letters	 of	 credit	 

to be supplied when GAR is to handle the shipping of 

palm oil.

deliveRing ouR pRoduCtS

We handle the distribution of palm oil and palm oil 

products through a joint venture with the global 

transportation business Stena Bulk AB. Golden-Agri Stena 

(GS) (formerly known as Golden Stena Weco) was formed 

in	2012,	and	is	the	only	JV	between	a	palm	oil	company	

and	a	shipper	in	the	sector,	making	it	unique	and	offering	

GAR logistical advantages in the market. 

In	 the	 past	 few	 years,	 we	 have	 increased	 the	 size	 of	

our fleet and developed our logistics infrastructure 

by investing in warehousing, jetty and port facilities in 

important strategic locations. 

The	 JV	 has	 25	 vessels	 in	 total	 with	 ten	 under	 direct	

ownership and seven on Time Charter. The majority of 

our own vessels are Ship Inspection Report Programme 

(SIRE) and CDI-Marine approved. These two approvals 

signify the vessels are in good condition, in compliance 

with shipping regulations and adhering to sustainable 

shipping practices. 

All time chartered vessels are vetted thoroughly and their 

technical managers audited by GS. All GS vessels are also 

issued guidelines and best practices on energy efficiency 

and	conservation.	The	JV	is	also	looking	into	expanding	

the inspection and vetting of all their shipments to 

secure safe transportation of palm oil cargoes in line with 

minimising its environmental footprint.

Our Indonesian operations were early adopters of 

certification of sustainably produced palm oil – SMART 

became a member of the RSPO in 2005 shortly after  

RSPO was founded. 

Industry certification is part of GAR’s ongoing commitment 

to adopt best practices and standards in responsible 

production while allowing us to meet growing demand 

for certified sustainable palm oil.

CeRtifiCation (103-2, 103-3)

To date, over 259,000 hectares of plantations including 

over 51,000 hectares of smallholder estates, 29 mills, 

nine kernel crushing plants, six refineries, seven bulking 

stations, and one oleochemicals plant have received 

RSPO certification. We have extended the time frame 

for completion of RSPO certification until 2020 for 

the remaining operations which include over 213,000 

hectares	 of	 plantations,	 and	 encompasses	 over	 49,000	

hectares of plasma estates and 16 mills. This extension 

reflects our conservative estimate for the time needed 

to	acquire	the	HGU	or	Right	to	Cultivate	and	the	liability	

data	as	required	recently	by	RSPO.	Our	RSPO	certification	

progress can be viewed on our website.

In	2014,	we	also	received	certification	for	having	met	the	

RSPO-RED	 Requirements	 for	 compliance	 with	 the	 EU	

Renewable	 Energy	 Directive	 Requirements	 (RSPO-RED	

scheme). The certification includes one mill and its supply 

base comprising nucleus and plasma plantations in Kijang, 

Riau.

The RSPO-RED scheme is a voluntary add-on to the 

RSPO standard and allows palm oil producers and 

processors under certain conditions to comply with 

requirements	 in	 the	 EU	 Directive	 2009/28/	 EC	 on	 the	

promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. 

This	 Directive	 specifies	 sustainability	 requirements	 for	

biofuels	 and	 bioliquids	 in	 the	 European	 Union.	 The	

milestone marks an extension of our commitment to 

RSPO certification. With the RSPO-RED certification, 

we now offer an alternative certified palm oil for biofuel 

production.

GAR continues to play an active role in the RSPO. In 

2017, Mr. Agus Purnomo, GAR’s Managing Director of 

Sustainability and Strategic Stakeholder Engagement was 

elected to the RSPO Board of Governors. He is also the 

Chair of Indonesian Growers Caucus (IGC) representing 

Indonesian Palm Oil Members within RSPO. GAR also

ensure a fair and transparent market for palm oil products 

in the country and we believe that this will create 

opportunities for GAR’s trusted brands.

In China, we sell palm oil-based and soybean-based 

products and offer a range of cooking oils, noodles and 

other food products. We look to optimise our oil refineries 

and soybean crushing facilities in the country on a 

continuous basis to meet evolving consumer demand.

 

In November 2017, we entered into a conditional 

agreement to divest our subsidiary, Sinarmas Natural 

Resources Foodstuff Technology (Tianjin) Co., Ltd. 

that owns and operates oilseeds crushing and refining 

facilities in Tianjin. The transaction was completed in April 

2018. This initiative is part of GAR’s strategy of refocusing 

its business model for its China’s oilseed division. 

We have also entered India, the second largest edible oil 

market after China, through the ownership of a destination 

processing facility. This asset enables us to participate 

in high-growth branded cooking oil and specialty fat 

industries in the country. 

We are expanding the reach of our branded consumer

ouR ConSumeRS (102-2, 102-6)

Aside from distributing palm oil to industrial customers, we 

also sell edible oil and food products directly to the end 

consumer in large markets like Indonesia, China and India.

Indonesia is the second largest market where we sell 

palm oil-based products that are widely used by both 

consumers and commercial customers. These include 

cooking oil brands like Filma and Kunci Mas and margarine 

and shortening products for the baking industry marketed 

under the Filma, Palmboom and Goodfry brands. 

Traditionally, most palm oil-based cooking oil has been 

sold as unbranded and unpacked cooking oil in Indonesia. 

However, the Government of Indonesia favours phasing 

out the purchasing of unbranded and unpacked cooking 

oil, placing greater importance on consumer brands, and 

ensuring strict hygiene levels, stable prices and more

each year, and none are considered health threatening.

We use digital and social media platforms such as

In terms of benefits, full-time workers receive free 

healthcare for themselves and their family, company 

housing, water, electricity and free education for their

provides its full-time workers with basic necessities such 

as rice. In 2017, GAR procured over 10,500 tonnes of food

Our part-time workers receive free medical services at our 

polyclinics and their children have access to education at 

our estate schools.

diveRSity and gendeR equality (103-1, 103-2, 406-1)

We	believe	in	promoting	gender	equality	in	the	workplace.	

However, the manual nature of agricultural work means 

that certain jobs continue to be more suited to male 

rather than female employees. Male workers perform 

heavier physical tasks such as harvesting FFB (which can 

weigh between 23- 27 kg) and carrying them to trucks for 

transport to the mills; women generally work on weeding 

and collecting loose fruits that have fallen on the ground. 

Traditional rural employment patterns also mean that 

many women prefer to take on part-time jobs, as it gives 

them the flexibility and time for other responsibilities such 

as tending to the household; childcare; family gardens; 

and other income-earning businesses.

We	 have	 zero	 tolerance	 for	 sexual	 harassment	 and	 we	

conduct extensive training for all estate and mill workers 

to ensure this is understood. Gender committees with 

representatives from labour unions and management 

have been set up to promote female participation and 

advancement in the workplace. These committees also 

handle sexual harassment complaints. When a case of 

harassment is reported either formally or informally, the 

relevant committee investigates the situation to determine 

whether further sanctions or law enforcement actions 

are needed. During the investigation, the committee also 

provides assistance and support to the victim. In 2017, no 

cases of harassment or abuse were reported.

one million hours of work, while the SR is the number of 

workdays lost in one million hours of work within the year. 

Such indicators help us track the effectiveness of measures 

taken to improve OHS in our operations and plantations. 

All units send in monthly reports which details number 

of employees, working days, absentee/non-effective 

days, overtime, number of accidents, and lost workdays. 

These are then analysed and the FR and SR are recorded. 

In 2017, we enlarged the scope of work-related

(103-3, 409-1, 412-1) 

In order to ensure that we are continuously improving, 

we engaged Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) to 

conduct an assessment of labour management systems 

and practices in PT Tapian Nadenggan, Central Kalimantan, 

Indonesia. The assessment which was published in 2017, 

aimed to highlight areas and provide recommendations 

on how GAR’s current management systems and tools 

could be strengthened or improved to help ensure 

good implementation of the GSEP, Code of Conduct 

and other relevant policies, as well as gradual fulfilment 

of international stakeholder expectations pertaining to 

labour-related issues in the palm oil industry. 

Overall the study found that GAR has a good set of 

policies at the Group level, as well as management 

systems and structures in place at the plantation level to 

help ensure workers’ welfare and wellbeing, and those 

of their families, are respected. There were some areas 

identified by BSR, where greater consistency between 

policy and implementation on the ground was highlighted 

for improvement. Further to this, the assessment covered 

several specific topics in detail, such as working conditions 

and terms of employment; non-discrimination; workers 

organisation; grievance mechanisms; protection of 

workforce; and living conditions.

palm oil benefitS loCal RuRal CommunitieS 

(103-1, 103-2, 413-1)

The palm oil industry has helped to advance socio-

economic development in tropical developing countries 

like Indonesia and Malaysia, and plays a key role in 

improving the lives of communities particularly those 

living in remote, rural areas. We aim to ensure that this 

development is inclusive and sustainable. 

As one of the largest palm oil companies in Indonesia, we 

have created thousands of jobs in rural and remote areas. 

We have also helped provide crucial public infrastructure 

such as roads, bridges, community halls and places 

of worship. This has helped advance the aims of SDGs 

amongst local communities in tackling poverty and 

reducing	 inequalities	 through	 the	 boosting	 incomes	 as	

well as their overall standards of living. 

We recognise that the establishment of plantations 

creates changes for local communities and indigenous 

people. As stated in the GSEP, we are committed to 

respecting human rights and fulfilling Free, Prior and 

Informed	 Consent	 (FPIC)	 requirements	 before	 any	

operations begin . GAR is also committed to improving its 

processes and procedures with regards to respecting the 

customary rights of local and indigenous communities. 

In addition to FPIC, 100 percent of our plantations have 

social community engagement and development plans. 

Collaboration and cooperation with the community is also 

key to the success of other aspects of responsible palm 

oil. We engage local communities in forest conservation, 

and take an inclusive and collaborative approach to 

addressing our sustainability challenges through our 

community conservation partnerships. This is detailed in 

the	section	on	“Environmental	Management”.	

While ensuring that the development of our industry is 

aligned with the interests of local communities, we also 

try to multiply the positive socio-economic impacts of 

our operations by promoting entrepreneur development 

and micro-enterprises in local communities. 

In 2017, we commissioned the Rainforest Alliance to carry 

out a verification of our GSEP implementation in three 

concessions in West Kalimantan where the widest range 

of GSEP implementation activities are being carried out. 

This includes a consideration of how we are implementing 

social and community engagement activities including 

FPIC.	 The	 results	 are	 detailed	 in	 the	 section	 “How	 We	

Approach	Responsible	Palm	Oil”.	

ReSpeCting human RightS and fRee, pRioR and 

infoRmed ConSent (fpiC) (103-2, 103-3, 411-1, 413-1)

FPIC is a central tenet of the GSEP and part of our 

commitment to upholding human and community rights. 

We implement FPIC in all our plantations. Respecting FPIC 

means we ensure that decision-making by indigenous 

peoples and local communities regarding the presence of 

our operations is done without pressure and intimidation 

(free), performed before an activity that has impact on the 

surrounding communities is carried out (prior), and with 

sufficient knowledge about the activity and its impact 

on the surrounding communities (informed), so they 

may express agreement or disagreement to such activity 

(consent).

For	 land	 acquisition,	 the	 implementation	 of	 this	 policy	

includes:

•	

Participatory	 Mapping	 and	 Land	 Tenure	 Study	 of	 all	

indigenous peoples and local community lands prior 

to negotiation

•	

Social	

Impact	

Assessments	

carried	

out	

using	

participatory methods, the results of which will be 

publicly available and actively shared with relevant 

stakeholders

•	

Engaged	and	open	negotiation	processes

•	

Documented	agreements	signed	by	and	shared	with	

all relevant parties

The approach aims to protect community rights to 

keep their forests and agricultural lands, and to ensure 

that food security is never compromised by land being 

converted for plantations. We support the Food and 

Agriculture	 Organisation’s	 Voluntary	 Guidelines	 on	 the	

Responsible Governance of Tenure which promotes 

secure	 tenure	 rights	 and	 equitable	 access	 to	 land,	

fisheries and forests as a means of eradicating hunger 

and poverty, supporting sustainable development and 

protecting the environment. 

Under our FPIC Standard Operational Procedures (SOP) 

we	 are	 required	 to	 follow	 a	 process	 of	 socialisation,	

when granted a location permit (Ijin Lokasi) for a new 

plantation. The socialisation process involves informing 

communities of the licenses, government and company 

policies regarding land compensation, development 

plans, land valuation approach, process of verifying land 

ownership	and	requirement	for	proof	of	ownership,	and	

procedures for land measurements and compensation.

After the socialisation, we seek to ensure that all 

communities have understood and acknowledged what 

the company has communicated, explained and offered 

during the process. When the necessary due diligence 

is completed, compensation will be made to those who 

have accepted the offer. Members of local government 

document and witness any land transfers that take place.

As part of our efforts to ensure that FPIC is implemented 

properly, we have continued with FPIC remediation in 

our concessions in West Kalimantan following feedback 

that	 initial	 FPIC	 requirements	 were	 not	 fully	 met.	 This	

process has been carried out with local CSO, LINKS, 

implementation partner TFT and Ekologika consultants 

involving fresh consultations with local communities and 

Participatory Mapping to ensure that the community’s 

land rights are fully respected. Amongst other things, this 

mapping verified that areas which had previously been 

identified as conservation HCS forests via satellite imagery, 

were mixed gardens being used by the community and 

planted with rubber and other cash crops. We have 

adjusted our conservation maps accordingly. 

In 2017, there were no incidents of FPIC violations or 

violations of the rights of indigenous peoples.

ReSponSible ConfliCt ReSolution

Our policies and practices are designed to minimise the 

likelihood of any conflicts arising from our operations. 

However, when these conflicts do arise, we are 

committed to working towards a responsible resolution.

We have worked with relevant stakeholders to put 

in place a balanced, accountable, mutually agreed 

and documented conflict resolution system that is 

accessible to smallholders, indigenous peoples, rural 

communities and other parties potentially affected by 

our operations.

Our conflict management system maps all conflicts 

related to our operations, and develops action plans to 

address them. It incorporates transparent monitoring 

and reporting, the option for local community and 

customary groups to access independent legal and 

technical advice, the ability for complainants to choose 

individuals or groups to support them or act as observers, 

as well as the option of a third party mediator. We 

categorically reject the use of violence in any dispute. 

In recent years, we have closed several long-running 

social conflicts following intense consultation with the 

local communities, local governments and with the help 

of external parties such as the RSPO and local CSOs. The 

case histories on the GAR website detail our efforts in 

finding collaborative and consultative ways to resolve 

disputes with local communities.

All children of the workers living on our estates receive 

free education from kindergarten to junior high school. 

We provide free school bus services so that children 

are able to get to school daily. In addition, we provide 

scholarships for students to attend schools near the 

plantations and run internship programmes for students 

at schools that specialise in agriculture.

We have also constructed over 30 Rumah Pintar or Smart 

Houses since 2011. These serve as community resource 

and training centres. Each Rumah Pintar has a library 

and	 play	 room	 and	 is	 equipped	 with	 computers.	 There	

is a particular focus on early childhood education and 

educational programmes for women at the Rumah Pintar. 

In 2017, we also provided over USD$1.5 million in 

scholarships for higher education at Indonesian and 

international universities and institutes. 

We help improve the wellbeing of local communities 

by providing access to healthcare in remote and rural 

areas. We currently mobilise 330 medical personnel 

at over 150 clinics which serves on average over 860 

patients daily. We also provided free medical and dental 

services to over 3,900 patients. With our special focus 

on mother and child health, we also focus on health 

education for over 3,300 beneficiaries as well as provide 

child vaccination and nutrition programmes for over 

1,900 beneficiaries. 

We also helped over 7,500 flood, fire and storm victims in 

2017 through distribution of food aid and basic necessities. 

pRomoting Small and miCRo enteRpRiSeS

Our operations and plantations play an important role as 

an economic driver and multiplier and have helped in the 

development of various businesses in remote areas of 

Indonesia. 

We actively help promote small and micro enterprises 

that help increase income for the community. One such 

programme is our goat breeding programme in eight 

villages around PT Ivo Mas Tunggal in Riau. 

The company has donated 160 goats to the villages to 

date. Local communities are able to earn extra income 

through the sale of milk and meat. As the villagers breed 

more goats, these will then be given to a Farmers Group 

in another village to grow and expand the scheme.

Continuing innovative Community 

ConSeRvation paRtneRShipS (103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 304-1)

Our most recent materiality assessment indicates that 

stakeholders continue to view forest conservation as 

well	as	fire	and	haze	as	material	issues.	At	GAR	we	have	

been focussing intensively on these areas for many years 

and we believe that with our combination of innovative 

community partnerships and collaboration, we are starting 

to see progress in practical and effective conservation. Our 

initiatives in forest protection, biodiversity conservation 

as well as our efforts to minimise land degradation 

contribute to the goals of UN SDG 15 – Life on Land.

Defining conservation areas on paper is only the first step; 

ensuring	they	are	properly	protected	on	the	ground	requires	

a workable model of collaboration and partnership with 

local communities and other key stakeholders such as local 

government. Without this, areas set aside for conservation 

remain	prone	to	encroachment	by	parties	who	frequently	

regard the area as unoccupied land. 

We have been working on conservation partnerships since 

2015, when we began collaborating with local communities 

to formally map their villages through Participatory 

Mapping. We help the villages map out critical areas such as 

customary boundaries and land necessary for food security. 

This map is then lodged with and formally recognised by 

the authorities, serving amongst other things to clarify 

land tenure rights and enabling villages to gain access to 

government development funds for the first time. 

The mapping lays the foundation for further dialogue 

on conservation through our Participatory Conservation 

Planning process. Our intensive consultative approach 

takes into account local community concerns, needs 

and	aspirations	including	food	security	requirements	and	

continued ability to earn a decent living and maintain 

stable	quality	of	life.	

We have rolled out mapping in over 80 villages across our 

concessions to date, and secured agreement with local 

communities in 13 villages to set aside over 7,700 hectares 

of High Carbon Stock (HCS) forests for conservation. This 

is in addition to the 72,000 hectares of conservation area 

in	our	concessions	(approximately	the	size	of	Singapore),	

consisting	of	HCS	forests	and	HCV.	

Following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding 

(MoU), we work with the villages and the local authorities 

to	 get	 the	 agreement	 recognised	 as	 part	 of	 Village	

Regulation, to ensure that the MoU has official standing 

and recognition. 

In tandem with these efforts, we have initiated development 

programmes for the local communities which participate 

in the conservation partnership. Integrated Ecological 

Farming projects have been launched in 11 villages in 

West Kalimantan and Central Kalimantan. These aim to 

help the local community achieve food self-sufficiency, 

earn extra income as well as raise awareness about 

alternative farming methods without the use of fire.

Each participating family can save up to IDR300,000 

per month through planting and harvesting their own 

vegetables. In addition, they receive about IDR500,000 per 

month from selling the surplus produce to surrounding 

villages. 

We have also used this model of community partnership 

in our efforts to rehabilitate 2,600 hectares of degraded 

peatland in the PT Agro Lestari Mandiri (AMNL) concession 

in West Kalimantan. This project was launched at the end 

of 2015. To date, we have progressed with replanting over 

100	hectares	of	buffer	zone	as	well	as	the	rewetting	of	the	

entire peat area. We are also working with the Tanjungpura 

University in Pontianak on a peat management study which 

focusses on peat mapping and hydrology of the area.

 

long-teRm fiRe pRevention (103-2, 103-3, 304-3)

We remain vigilant on fire prevention and in 2017 as in 

2016,	we	had	virtually	zero	fires	in	our	area	(less	than	0.01%	

of total area affected by fires)1, due to strict adherence to 

our	Zero	Burning	Policy.	We	continue	to	publish	weekly	

reports on fire in or around our areas on our Sustainability 

Dashboard. 

Meanwhile, we continued our long-term community 

collaboration on fire prevention with 17 local villages 

in 2017, through the Desa Makmur Peduli Api (DMPA) 

programme in Ketapang, Kalimantan and Jambi, Sumatra. 

The DMPA programme has generally helped to reduce

spread knowledge and awareness about the dangers of 

forest fires and the importance of forest conservation, 

in the hopes that this will eventually trigger communal 

behaviourial changes, particularly with regards to not 

using fire to clear land. 

In 2018, we extended the DMPA programme to five 

more villages in Indragiri, Riau and 10 villages in Central

preserving and protecting this biodiversity. This is 

achieved through our identification and protection of 

HCV	 areas	 backed	 up	 by	 our	 Zero	 Tolerance	 Policy	

towards hunting, injuring, possessing and killing of rare 

and endangered wildlife. 

We continuously educate our employees, local

Protection of orangutans is a special focus for GAR. Since 

2011, we have partnered with Orangutan Foundation 

International (OFI) to rehabilitate and release wild-born, 

formerly captive primates. Our partnership has resulted 

in the release of 100 orangutans into their natural habitat 

in Seruyan Forest in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. 

In addition, more than 1,000 staff have been trained in 

orangutan conservation. They are mainly involved in 

field operations in Kalimantan, with some overseeing 

our biodiversity and conservation efforts. GAR also 

maintains	1,400	hectares	of	HCV	area	in	Sungai	Rungau,	

Central Kalimantan as an orangutan sanctuary.

Through	our	HCV	assessment,	we	have	identified	the	rare

Our

is 

complemented by our belief that R&amp;D can deliver 

sustainable agricultural goals. One such goal is yield 

improvement which has multiple benefits. Through 

improving yields, we can help raise the incomes of 

smallholders and their standards of living. It can also help 

reduce the pressure to open up more land for agriculture. 

Following years of research SMARTRI and SMART 

Biotechnology Centre officially launched two new non-

GMO, extremely high-yielding planting materials in 2017. 

Eka 1 and Eka 2 are potentially capable of yielding more 

than 10 tonnes/hectare/year of CPO, making them the 

highest-yielding plant materials in the industry. Currently, 

the national average yield in Indonesia is 3.5 tonnes. These 

clonal seeds will be gradually rolled out throughout our 

plantations in replanting programmes starting in 2022.

ReduCing ghg emiSSionS (103-1, 103-2, 305-4)

Successful conservation of HCS forests is one of the ways 

in which we retain large stores of carbon and help avoid 

GHG emissions. 

In addition, we have also carried out a baseline study of 

our Scope 1 GHG emissions including measurements 

of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in our 

mills and plantations, and are in the midst of designing 

an emission reduction strategy. The main sources of 

enViRonmentAl mAnAgement

GHG emissions at the mill comes from Palm Oil Mill 

Effluent (POME), and the usage of diesel as fuel and for 

power production. GHG emissions from the plantation 

come from the usage of fertilisers, diesel and land use 

change. We have commissioned EY to review and verify 

how we calculate our carbon footprint, identify viable 

opportunities to reduce emissions and set short, medium 

and long-term reduction targets for the business.

We used the ISCC Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/

EC as the basis for calculating our GHG emissions. 

The data was compiled from 30 mills that have ISCC 

certification.

In addition, our Downstream R&amp;D has also made a 

considerable impact on reducing packaging and making 

the transport of our products more environmentally 

friendly. We have done this by reducing the material 

thickness or weight of the packaging material to 

maximise space when loading containers. This has led to 

lower costs, lower energy consumption and reduction of 

carbon emissions.

In 2017, we saved 256 tonnes of packaging which 

equals	a	further	13	percent	of	total	packaging	reduction	

compared to 2016.

We also take steps to minimise any risk of pollution

chemicals near and around riparian areas; restricting 

the	application	of	treated	liquid	waste	(POME)	which	is	

used as fertiliser to 50 metres from riparian areas; and 

planting vetiver grass to minimise soil erosion at riparian 

areas. Our efforts to successfully conserve forests also 

contributes towards maintaining and preserving fresh 

water resources in light of research that shows strong 

links between forest cover and the health and availability 

of water resources.

We have Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) which 

specify that the use of fertilisers should be tailored to the 

texture of the soil and its capacity for retaining nutrients; 

that fertilisers should not be applied during periods of 

heavy rain; and that there should always be an appropriate 

interval between applications. We also recycle palm 

fronds and other organic products to increase the fixing 

capacity of soils.

We follow an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach 

which combines cultural, mechanical, biological and 

chemical means to control pests while minimising 

economic, public health and environmental risks.

Natural solutions and biological controls are our 

preferred method for controlling pests across all our 

plantations, including beneficial plants that attract 

parasitoids to control pests, pathogens or bacteria, and 

natural predators. We supplement this approach using 

handpicking and mechanical traps. 

Examples of this include barn owls which are bred on 

our estates to control the rat population; leaf-eating 

caterpillars are controlled through diversity of flora and 

encouraging beneficial plants; and pheromones are used 

to control rhinoceros beetles. 

 

monitoRing and minimiSing the uSe of 

peStiCideS (103-2, 103-3)

We aim to minimise pesticide use throughout all growth 

phases of the oil palms. We only use chemical fungicides 

in our nurseries, and only deploy chemical insecticides 

and rodenticides to control outbreaks of infestation 

when biological controls have failed. In such cases, 

these products are used carefully and in compliance with 

national laws. Most of the products we use are chemical 

herbicides for weed control and management.

GAR manages the undergrowth in oil palm plantations 

to maintain a high level of weed diversity while keeping 

good access to the oil palms in order to ensure a high 

quality	harvesting.	Only	woody	plants	and	noxious	weeds	

are removed regularly at our plantations. 

We apply herbicides according to the following strict 

guidelines:

•	

Temporal	 selectivity:	 applying	 at	 specific	 times	 and	

reducing the number of applications to between one 

and three per year, depending on the type of herbicide 

•	

Spatial	 selectivity:	 spraying	 only	 the	 circle	 of	 the	 oil	

palms and harvesting path, or about 20 percent of the 

soil surface

•	

Species	 and	 active	 ingredient	 selectivity:	 active	

ingredients are selected depending on the types of 

weed to be controlled. SMARTRI is always testing new 

types of active ingredients as well as new conditions 

of application in order to choose the most efficient 

and least environmentally impacting product 

Since	 2016,	 GAR	 has	 stopped	 using	 paraquat.	 In	

addition, pesticides that are categorised as World Health 

Organization	 Class	 1A	 or	 1B,	 or	 that	 are	 listed	 by	 the	

Stockholm or Rotterdam Conventions are not used, 

except in specific situations identified in national best 

practice guidelines, such as during an extreme pest

SMARTRI’s research also explores areas such as climate 

change mitigation. 

R&amp;D conducted by SMARTRI contributed to the 

development of our high-yielding Dami Mas seeds 

which have also been developed to be disease-resistant. 

SMARTRI also worked on and developed two new super 

high-yielding clonal seeds – Eka 1 and Eka 2 – which 

have the potential to produce over 10 tonnes/ha/year 

of CPO. This will help the goal of UN SDG 2 which 

aspires to provide nutritious food for all and generate 

decent incomes, while supporting people-centred rural 

development and protecting the environment. 

In tandem with boosting agricultural productivity, 

SMARTRI also works on various R&amp;D projects designed 

to promote environmental sustainability, preserve 

biodiversity 

and 

combat 

climate 

change, 

thus 

supporting the goals of UN SDG 15. 

meaSuRing gReenhouSe gaS (ghg) emiSSionS 

(103-2) 

GHG emissions in palm oil agriculture comes mainly 

from land use change and methane emissions during the 

treatment of POME. Aside from this, nitrogen fertiliser 

applications can also contribute to emissions of nitrous 

oxide (N2O) especially if applied incorrectly. 

In line with our commitment to continuously reduce 

our GHG footprint, GAR, through SMARTRI, has started 

a research programme into this issue. The programme 

includes: 

1.	 Quantifying	N2O emissions

2. Determining the factors which can have a potential 

impact on the level of these emissions

3. Testing new products and field practices to reduce 

these emissions

SMARTRI has found that N2O emissions factors (EF) 

were significantly affected by the level of soil moisture. 

Regardless of the levels of urea applied, EF was lowest 

when the moisture of soil was low. The losses of N2O 

ranged from 0.37 to 3.72 kg N2O/ha. 

An initial experiment using urea fertiliser coated with 

urease and a nitrification inhibitor showed a good potential 

to mitigate N2O	losses	by	up	to	64	percent.	The	results	

were shared with the industry at the 2018 International 

Conference on Oil Palm and the Environment (ICOPE).

new CollaboRation between SmaRtRi and 

CambRidge univeRSity on the ReStoRation of 

RipaRian funCtionS

The Riparian Ecosystem Restoration in Tropical Agriculture 

(RERTA) project is a new long-term experiment testing 

strategies for riparian restoration in oil palm landscapes. 

The project is a collaboration between SMARTRI and the 

University of Cambridge and has been acknowledged by 

RSPO. 

This project will test four different restoration strategies 

in long-term field experiments in Indonesian oil palm 

plantations. Data will be collected on biodiversity, 

ecosystem processes, socio-economic factors and crop 

yield before, during and after riparian restoration. Results 

from the work will inform sustainable management 

options and directly test links between biodiversity, 

ecosystem functioning and productivity in a complex 

tropical ecosystem.

The project will establish replicated riparian restoration 

treatments across mature oil palm plantations, owned 

and managed by GAR in Riau Province.

Results will provide specific recommendations of the 

most appropriate options for restoring riparian margins in 

established oil palm, and an evidence base for management 

to improve sustainability in tropical agricultural landscapes. 

The project will enhance the understanding of links 

between the environment, biodiversity and ecosystem 

processes in complex tropical ecosystems. 

tRaining foR SmallholdeRS

Aside from R&amp;D activities, SMARTRI runs regular training 

programmes for smallholders. 

In 2017, more than 600 farmers in Riau and East Kalimantan 

took part in training programmes by SMARTRI, focusing 

mainly on integrated pest management and fertiliser 

management. Beneficial plants are given to the farmers 

at the end of the training session, to be planted in their 

field to contribute to the biological control of herbivories. 

In addition, SMARTRI staff also visit smallholder farms 

when	 requested	 to	 help	 solve	 pest	 outbreak	 issues	 or	

nutrient deficiency cases.

Schematic diagram of the experimental set-up. Each treatment will be replicated three times on rivers over 5m wide. 

The current replanting strategy in these estates is restoration treatment 2, so this will form the matrix in which other 

treatments are embedded

1) no restoration, replanting to  

river margin

2) no restoration, maintenance of 

50m mature palm buffer

3) enrichment planting in 50m 

buffer, clearance of mature  

oil palm to river margin

4) enrichment planting and 

maintenance of mature oil palm

We are focusing on minimising occurrence of 3-MCPD 

precursors. Our business is tackling the issue holistically, 

for example by minimising free fatty acids (FFA) in 

CPO. Throughout 2017, R&amp;D continued to optimise 

identification methods for 3-MCPD and GE, in order to 

release safe and healthy edible oil.



iCope 2018: “embRaCing SuStainable palm oil: SolutionS foR loCal pRoduCtion and global 

Change” 

The International Conference on Oil Palm and Environment (ICOPE) is a biennial conference focusing on the 

development of sustainable palm oil. ICOPE is a collaboration between Sinar Mas Agribusiness and Food, World 

Wildlife Fund (WWF) Indonesia, and CIRAD France. 

More	than	400	participants	from	more	than	30	countries	attended	the	2018	conference,	including	academics,	

scientists, government officials, financial bodies, palm oil sector businesses and non-governmental organisations 

with a combined purpose – to minimise the environmental impact of palm oil production whilst maximising its 

value to society. ICOPE is the only international conference dedicated to oil palm and the environment. 

The 2018 conference aimed to find solutions that contribute to global change while improving palm oil farmers’ 

livelihoods. 



R&amp;d to SafeguaRd ConSumeR health (416-1)

Aside from SMARTRI, we have also set up a Downstream 

R&amp;D	 centre	 to	 develop	 a	 variety	 of	 quality	 edible	 food	

products using palm oil. 

A major focus of the Downstream R&amp;D Centre is 

safeguarding the health of consumers using processed 

palm oil. This includes addressing consumer concerns 

about trans-fatty acids, which are generated through a 

process called hydrogenation. Our Downstream R&amp;D has 

been reformulating many of our processed products to 

eliminate all trans-fatty acids, without compromising on 

quality	for	the	consumer	or	technical	manufacturer.	This	

continued to be a priority throughout 2017 and into 2018. 

We are also actively working to reduce certain co-

contaminants found in processed palm oil. These co-

contaminants include 2-monochloropropane-1, 3-diol 

and 3-monochloropropane-1, 2-diol (3-MCPD) and 

Glycidol/Glycidyl esters (GE), which are formed during 

food production and preparation at high temperatures. 

During refining of palm oil, they can occur during the 

deodorisation step. This processing step aims to remove 

unwanted	taste	and	odour	to	meet	customer	quality	and	

safety specifications.

In 2016, the European Food Standards Authority (EFSA) 

issued	a	report	warning	about	the	health	consequences	

of co-contaminants such as 3-MCPD and from 2018, has 

revised acceptable 3-MCPD and GE levels.
