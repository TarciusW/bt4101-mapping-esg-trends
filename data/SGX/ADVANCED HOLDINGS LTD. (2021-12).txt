REPORTING PRACTICE

Reporting Principles &amp; Statement of Use

The Group’s FY2021 sustainability report (“Report”) has been produced with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative 

(“GRI”) Standards “Core” option. This Report covers our performance from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021. The 

GRI standards were selected as it is a globally recognised sustainability reporting standard that is recommended by the 

SGX-ST and represents the global best practices for reporting on economic, environmental and social topics. A detailed 

section reference with GRI Standards is documented in the GRI Content Index section of this Report. We have applied 

the GRI principles for deﬁning reporting content and ensuring quality of information: a) GRI principles for deﬁning report 

content: Stakeholder Inclusiveness, Sustainability Context, Materiality and Completeness; b) GRI principles for deﬁning 

report quality: Accuracy, Balance, Clarity, Comparability, Reliability and Timeliness. 

The Report incorporates the primary components of report content as set out by the SGX-ST requirements on 

sustainability reporting under Catalist Rule 711B. The Board has reviewed and approved the reported information, 

including the material topics.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“UN SDGs”) have also been incorporated into the Report, 

highlighting our contributions to sustainable development.

Reporting Scope

This Report covers the Group’s operations in Singapore, China, the USA and the UK. Subsidiaries covered in this Report 

consist of:

•   AHL, ACPL and CAE (Singapore)

•   ACS (China)

•   GWI (USA)

•   ATAC (UK)

The incorporation of AAPL and PT AAI do not have any material impact on the Group’s earnings and net assets for 

FY2021 and have not been included in this Report.

Restatements

No restatements of information given in previous reports.

Assurance

Internal controls and veriﬁcation mechanisms have been established by management to ensure the accuracy and 

reliability of narratives and data. We have also considered the recommendations of an external ESG consultant for the 

selection of material topics as well as compliance with the GRI Standards and SGX-ST Listing Rules. The Board has 

therefore assessed that external assurance is not required for the Report. The Group will continue to assess the need to 

further enhance the credibility of our sustainability report through internal review or external assurance.

the interests of all relevant stakeholders are considered when making business decisions.

Corporate Governance and Risk Management

Advanced adopts a precautionary approach in strategic decision making and daily operations by implementing a 

comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) framework. We have integrated the process for identifying, 

assessing and managing material ESG related risks into our organisation’s overall risk management framework.

All new employees are given an induction programme on the Group’s Code of Ethics and core values before they 

commence work. All reported instances of ethical breaches and non-compliance are investigated fairly and thoroughly. 

Please refer to the Statement of Corporate Governance section in the Annual Report for more information on corporate 

governance practices and risk management structure.

ESG Governance and Statement of the Board  

 

 

 

At Advanced, sustainability is prioritised at the Board level. We have established a Sustainability Task Force (“Task

FOCUS 1: GOVERNANCE AND ETHICS


The Board has considered sustainability issues during the formulation of the Group’s strategy, approved the material 

environmental, social and economic topics identiﬁed and factors identiﬁed are appropriately managed and monitored.

Ethics and Integrity

Anti-Corruption

GRI 205-1, 205-2, 205-3

The Group’s business core principles revolve around integrity, responsibility and accountability. An Employee Code of 

Conduct is in place to reiterate our ﬁrm position against corruption and bribery and provides a framework for all staff to 

adhere to in their dealings with customers, business partners and other colleagues. Our stance against corruption and 

bribery is also clearly communicated to all business partners before they commence dealings with us.

There were no incidents of corruption or public legal action brought against the Group during the reporting year. 

Whistleblowing 

The Group has also set in place whistle-blowing procedures pursuant to which staff of the Group may, in conﬁdence or 

anonymously, raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of ﬁnancial reporting or other matters to the Audit 

Committee. Investigations on matters raised are undertaken by members of the Audit Committee with the assistance of 

the Managing Director and/or senior management of the Group, where appropriate. The objective for such arrangement 

is to ensure independent investigation of matters raised and to allow appropriate actions, without detrimental or unfair 

treatment to the staff who made the report, to be taken. The procedures for submission of complaints have been 

explained to all employees of the Group. Following investigation and evaluation of a complaint, the Audit Committee will 

then decide on recommended disciplinary or remedial action, if any. The action so determined by the Audit Committee 

to be appropriate shall then be brought to the Board or to the appropriate members of senior management for 

authorisation or implementation, respectively.

Customer Privacy and Data Protection

Tax Compliance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

GRI 207-1, 207-2, 207-3, 207-4

The Group’s strategy and approach to tax is to fully comply with relevant tax laws and regulations in all jurisdictions we 

operate in, which indirectly support the local governments and authorities in their economic, environmental and social 

development and objectives. The Group has zero tolerance for any intentional breach of tax laws and regulations. 

The Group identiﬁes tax related risks as part of its ERM framework which is reported regularly to the Audit Committee. 

Implementation of tax compliance related policies and procedures are delegated to the respective business units and are 

monitored by the Group’s Chief Financial Ofﬁcer.

Relevant staff attend tax related trainings to keep updated on key changes. The Group also engages qualiﬁed 

professional tax advisors in all jurisdictions to ensure compliance at the transaction levels as well as fulﬁlling required tax 

ﬁlings. The Audit Committee may also from time to time engage the Group’s internal auditor to monitor compliance with 

the tax governance and control framework. Any instances of non-compliance are reported to the Audit Committee and 

resolved promptly. 

Governance and Ethics Targets



Financial Year ending 31 December 2022 ("FY2022") Targets

TRANSFORMING FOR A SUSTAINABLE TOMORROW.


Product Quality and Productivity  

GRI 203-2

We have standardised engineering designs and material model selection to improve product accuracy, as well as 

standardised operating procedures and speciﬁcations to improve product installation quality. We also established a 

Combustion Ion-Chromatography Analysis sampling system to reduce man-hours and increase operational productivity. 

Our manufacturing plant in China, ACS, replaced manual dimensioning of arrangement drawings with 3D modelling 

which effectively reduced man-hours, and installed an Ofﬁce Automation software which enabled the automation of 

various workﬂows and processes, thus improving overall operational efﬁciency.

With enhanced quality and productivity management measures, our products effectively increase the efﬁciency and 

productivity of our customers’ operations.

FOCUS 4:

PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT

Advanced recognises the need to preserve and protect the environment. We strive to be an environmentally responsible 

supplier of engineering equipment by implementing energy-efﬁcient manufacturing practices.  

Energy-Saving Products 

GRI 302-5

Advanced delivers products that provide solutions for some of the most pressing environmental issues. The research 

and development team develops engineering technologies to reduce the carbon emissions and energy consumption of 

our analysers. 

We are cognizant of the energy-related impacts in our supply chain and have taken active steps to monitor and reduce 

it. Our procurement and engineering departments procure energy-saving components for our ﬁnal products whenever 

possible. 

Sustainable Manufacturing

GRI 302-1, 302-3, 305-2, 305-4, 305-7, 306-2

The Group strives to operate sustainably by reducing its carbon footprint in its ofﬁce and manufacturing facilities. The 

only source of energy is electricity purchased for consumption. As such, the Group has implemented energy-saving 

initiatives, such as switching off all lights during non-operating hours and maintaining the air-conditioning temperature at 

24 degrees Celsius. 

We have implemented a go paperless initiative to reduce paper usage and wastage. Paper-based tasks such as 

invoices, ﬁlings and payments are processed electronically whenever possible. Drawings and documents are reviewed 

electronically with the help of an ofﬁce automation system. 

Our manufacturing plant in China, ACS, implemented additional measures to improve operational productivity and 

reduce resource wastage, such as improving production accuracy and incorporating a product recovery system to 

recycle used gases and liquids. In addition, photocell light sensors and audio control lights were installed to minimise 

energy wastage. ACS also replaced its original lights with light-emitting diode (“LED”) lights, as well as the air compressor 

and gas tank to increase energy efﬁciency. Similarly, our manufacturing plant in UK, ATAC, upgraded all ﬂuorescent 

lights to LED lights which reduced energy consumption. All heavy equipment are regularly serviced to improve energy 

efﬁciency and minimise energy wastage. 

We have reduced our energy consumption and Green House Gas (“GHG”) emissions compared to the ﬁnancial year 

ended 31 December 2020 (“FY2020”). The Group's energy consumption for FY2021 totalled 988,549 kWh, 8.5% lower 

than the Group's energy consumption of 1,080,278 kWh in FY2020. This was despite the increase in energy 

consumption at our Singapore entities as staff returned to ofﬁce to work in FY2021 following the easing of COVID-19 

workplace regulations by the Singapore Government. The Group's energy intensity in FY2021 averaged at 3.0 

kWh/man-hour, lower than the 3.3 kWh/man-hour energy intensity in FY2020.

TRANSFORMING FOR A SUSTAINABLE TOMORROW.


Gases such as Sulphur Dioxide are used as a test gas in the quality control stage of some equipment to measure their 

accuracy and reliability. In an effort to mitigate discharge of hazardous gas during manufacturing, an insigniﬁcant amount 

of the gas is used and exhausted in the testing process. The testing environment is also equipped with a fume hood to 

prevent any leftover toxic fumes from being discharged into the environment.  

We optimise the management of all efﬂuents discharge and waste disposal by implementing measures such as reducing 

and recycling waste at all manufacturing sites. In addition, since our inception, we have arranged to sell the scrap metal 

waste generated during manufacturing to resellers for recycling.  

Environmental Compliance 

GRI 307-1

Advanced strictly complies with local environmental regulations where we operate. 

Our U.K. manufacturing entity conforms to the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive for its electrical waste 

management, and it complies with the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations for chemicals 

management.

The USA manufacturing entity complies with environmental regulations under the California Environmental Protection 

Agency to restore, protect and enhance the environment, and to ensure public health, environmental quality and 

economic vitality.

There were no incidents of non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations in FY2021.

FOCUS 5:

HUMAN CAPITAL

Advanced believes in fair employment practices and providing all employees with equal opportunities. We have 

implemented policies to ensure that all operations are in compliance with local labour regulations and all employees are 

treated fairly.

Safety Measures against COVID-19

GRI 403-1

In FY2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to pose a health and safety risk to our employees and workers. During 

these unsettling times, we stay committed to prioritising their safety. 

To ensure the safety and welfare of our staff and workers across all entities, we keep abreast of the local COVID-19 

safety laws and regulations and implement any new measures as soon as possible to ensure that the working conditions 

of all staff and workers are in strict compliance with local COVID-19 laws and regulations. This helps us to minimise the 

risk of transmission among the workers and surrounding community. 

With the current COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented safe management measures (“SMM”) on the Group level 

to provide a safe working environment for all staff and workers. All staff and workers are briefed on the SMM and are 

required to ensure strict enforcement. Some of the SMM include the implementation of temperature screening and visitor 

management for all individuals who are entering the premises, safe distancing and staggered working hours to minimise 

contact between employees. We also increased the frequency of cleaning and disinfection of our premises, especially 

areas with high contact points. 

In FY2021, there were no incidents of COVID-19 transmission among employees. In addition, there were no reported 

incidents of non-compliance with local COVID-19 laws and regulations regarding the living conditions of our foreign 

workers.

Occupational Health and Safety 

GRI 403-5, 403-9

The Group believes that our employees are our greatest asset, and safeguarding their health and safety is essential in 

our operations. We comply strictly with workplace safety regulations at all manufacturing facilities. 

The Group provides adequate health and safety training for all employees at our manufacturing facilities to reduce the 

risk of mechanical hazards (injuries arising from moving parts of machines) and non-mechanical hazards (harmful 

emissions and chemical by-products). 

We necessitate all engineering and manufacturing personnel to be equipped with suitable safety gear, including 

protective clothing, helmets, goggles, tools and safety accessories when working in the factory. First Aid kits are 

available at all manufacturing sites in case of open injuries. AHL also conducts annual ﬁre drills to ensure that all 

employees are well-prepared in case of ﬁre hazards.  

There were no reported incidents of workplace safety incidents in FY2021.

Workforce Diversity 

GRI 202-2, 405-1, 405-2

The Group promotes gender and age diversity in our Board, key management and workforce to ensure continuity in the 

pipeline of skilled employees. We practice fair remuneration for all employees regardless of gender and age. 

FOCUS 5: HUMAN CAPTIAL

TRANSFORMING FOR A SUSTAINABLE TOMORROW.


As at end of FY2021, there were 166 employees across all entities. The following graph summarises the age and gender 

diversity in the Group’s workforce:

As at 31 December 2021, the top management had several women in key leadership roles. Our Board and employee 

diversity is a major force in driving change and innovation in the Group.

The graphs below show the gender distribution of our Board and key management on a group level (including 

subsidiaries) in FY2021:

The Group hires senior management from the local community, including Singapore, China, USA, UK and Thailand. This 

allows us to effectively harness their market knowledge and optimise the growth of our business in various countries. 

Employee Beneﬁts and Development 

GRI 401-1, 401-2, 404-1, 404-2, 404-3

Advanced makes an effort to promote employee wellbeing and ensure that all staff remain engaged and motivated. We 

provide employee beneﬁts as regulated by labour laws to promote employee wellbeing and productivity, including but 

not limited to healthcare, insurance and parental leave. 

To build on our success, we continue to focus on human capital development as it has a strategic role in our business 

growth and organisation strategy. Advanced prioritises engineering science and aims to become a leader in the ﬁeld 

through continuous innovation. To have a better standing ground in an industry that is constantly evolving, it is imperative 

for Advanced to retain and develop the right people with the right skills in our organisation. Aside from bonus schemes, 

the Group provides employees with opportunities for growth and development, such as conducting internal and external 

training courses, relocations or job reassignments to upgrade our employees and provide them with career progression.

FOCUS 5: HUMAN CAPTIAL


Annual performance reviews are conducted and used as an opportunity to identify additional training required for 

employees to achieve their targets set for the following years. In FY2020, we were unable to conduct performance 

reviews in most ofﬁces due to the implementation of COVID-19 lockdowns. In FY2021, 88% of our employees 

participated in performance reviews. 

The Group achieved an average of 5 training hours per employee per annum in FY2021 as compared to our target of 16 

training hours per employee. Training hours was lower than target is due to COVID-19 restrictions on in-person classes, 

which has reduced the number of external training sessions attended by employees. The Group's average turnover rate 

was 5% in FY2021 as compared to 27% in FY2020. 

Ethical Labour Practices

GRI 202-1, 406-1, 408-1, 409-1, 419-1

Advanced strictly complies with minimum wage laws at all of our operating facilities. We do not tolerate any form of 

discrimination, forced labour or child labour in our operations. 

There were no incidents of non-compliance with laws and regulations in the social and economic area in FY2021.

FOCUS 6:

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

Corporate Social Responsibility 

GRI 413-1

Advanced has incorporated social, environmental and cultural commitment in our business practices. We have cultivated 

a corporate culture of social-accountability, unity, and compassion.

Advanced is a proud sponsor of the National Arthritis Foundation, which is the main public organisation in Singapore 

devoted to helping Arthritis sufferers, educating patients and the public on Arthritis, and supporting Arthritis research. 

In FY2021, Advanced contributed to an initiative to alleviate poverty in China by donating to the “Joining Hands to 

Prosper the Village” program. We continue to be part of the Breadline donation program and provided valued assistance 

to two needy families in Singapore.

To promote environmental friendliness across the organisation, we provided reusable cutleries and lunchboxes for staff 

in our Singapore ofﬁces (ACPL and CAE). This helps to reduce the usage of disposable containers and utensils when 

purchasing food for takeaway, effectively reducing the generation of plastic waste.

We will continue to encourage our staff and subsidiaries to play their part as a responsible member of the local and 

international community.
