Kimly Limited (the “Company” or “Kimly”, and 

together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) 

started in 1990 as the modest operator of a single 

coffeeshop. Since then, we have grown into one 

of the largest traditional coffeeshop operators 

in Singapore, with an extensive network of 

outlets where customers from all walks of life 

can enjoy delicious and value for money meals in 

comfortable settings. 

Our steady growth over the past decades can be 

attributed to adopting a long-term perspective, 

understanding the needs of our customers, and 

constantly innovating products and services 

to meet those needs. We are committed to 

sustainable business practices to create value, 

care for our stakeholders and wider community, 

and do our part in protecting the environment. 

COVID-19 had been an unexpected tsunami 

that created operating challenges across the 

world in 2020. Borders closed with supply chain 

disruptions. Many businesses were hit badly, 

including food and beverage operators. Our 

business too was affected during the April to June 

Circuit Breaker period in Singapore when dine-in 

was prohibited to contain the spread of the virus. 

Fortunately, our people and operations were 

quick to respond to the crisis. Sustainability-centric 

practices – such as paying close attention to 

sourcing of raw materials, providing regular 

training for our staff, as well as ongoing vigilance 

in safety and hygiene practices – enabled us to 

continue our essential role of serving meals 

to thousands of residents at affordable prices 

and 

expanding 

reach 

through 

accelerated 

digitalisation of food delivery platform and 

recalibration of food staples and concepts under 

very challenging circumstances. 

Our sustainability philosophy of looking at 

economic, social and environmental factors has 

enhanced our organisational resilience during 

these unprecedented times. Not only have we 

managed our risks and kept the business on a 

steady keel, we are unlocking new opportunities 

such as catering to the growing demand in food 

delivery. It affirms our belief that anchoring 

sustainability at the heart of what we do is good 

for business and good for all our stakeholders.     

Board’s Statement

Sustainability Report 2020






The Group has 30 years of experience in operating and managing an extensive network of coffeeshops, 

industrial canteens and food courts. It also operates a network of food stalls, restaurants and 

confectionary shops comprising of Kimly Mixed Vegetable Rice, Kimly Teochew Porridge, Kimly Dim

Corporate Profile

Employee Diversity

We have a diverse workforce. As of 30 September 

2020, Kimly had a total of 2,136 employees 

inclusive of part-timers, a moderate increase of 

2.3% as compared to 2,088 employees a year ago. 

The gender ratio was 53.3% female to 46.7% male, 

similar to 51.4% female to 48.6% male in FY2019. 

55.4% of our workforce were above 50 years of 

age, compared to 50.5% in FY2019. We value our 

mature workers as they are experienced, reliable 

and able to mentor their younger peers. 64.6% 

of our workforce were local Singapore residents, 

with the rest coming from regional countries 

such as Malaysia, China, Vietnam and Indonesia. 

A breakdown of our workforce by age segments 

is shown below.

Kimly is an equal-opportunity employer and treats 

all staff fairly regardless of age, race or gender. 

We have a group-wide Non-Discrimination Policy, 

and any staff that feels unfairly treated against 

can approach our Human Resource Department 

for assistance. In FY2020, we did not receive any 

staff complaint on discriminatory practices in the 

workplace. 

We have a transparent system to recognise and 

reward all employees based on demonstrated 

performance, competence and experience. Staff 

remuneration is determined based on employees’ 

performance, roles and responsibilities, as well as 

the Group’s financial performance. We conduct 

annual appraisals for all employees using 

measurable factors and qualitative criteria such 

as team spirit, interpersonal skills and creativity.

Employee Benefits

Kimly provides a comprehensive and attractive 

suite of employee benefits based on statutory 

requirements and industry norms. This includes 

medical insurance, annual and parental leave, as 

well as monthly transport and meal allowances for 

eligible employees. Our employee benefits have 

helped us to attract and retain good people, and 

positioned Kimly as a caring employee with a family-

centric corporate culture. 301 staff were awarded 

the School Textbook subsidy of S$208 to defray 

their children’s education expenses in FY2020. 

The Company adopted the Kimly Performance 

Share Plan (“Kimly PSP”) on 15 February 2017. 

The objective is to share the Group’s success 

with more of our employees and strengthen the 

link between performance and compensation. 

During FY2019, we had granted share awards to 

our outlets’ Operations Managers. In FY2020, we 

expanded the Kimly PSP to key personnel in the 

Dim Sum Department. We would be extending the 

Kimly PSP to more employees over time, starting 

with the Seafood Department on 1 January 2021.

Training and Education

As a service-based business, the Group recognises 

that our employees are our most important 

assets. We do not target a fixed number of hours 

of training per employee. Instead, we provide our 

people with various training and development 

opportunities to sharpen their skills at work, 

upgrade their lifelong employability, and build 

pride and loyalty. 

In FY2020, we provided on-job training for our 

frontliners to use the combi ovens that were 

progressively deployed in more of our food stalls 

to increase productivity. We also trained the 

frontliners to use the Point of Sale (“POS”) terminals 

integrated to the new unified payments and 

Enterprise Resource Planning system (“ERP”). Our 

corporate office staff were sent for relevant training 

programmes – such as Data Analytics for Digital 

Marketing and Marketing Campaign Management 

– to improve their functional skills and awareness 

of the latest industry trends and tools. 

 

Impact of COVID-19 on Human 

Resource Issues

The introduction of Malaysia’s Movement Control 

Order (“MCO”) and border closure in March 2020 

meant that our staff who used to commute daily 

from Malaysia to Singapore could no longer do 

so. Malaysian staff at our outlets were provided 

lodging allowances and assistance to find 

accommodation in Singapore, while Malaysian staff 

at our corporate office were allocated equipment 

to work from home and business processes were 

adjusted to facilitate remote access. 

We did not retrench any staff arising from the 

impact of COVID-19 in FY2020 as our business in 

consumer staples proved to be resilient. We also 

did not see any anomalous increase in resignation 

rates. Our staff provided feedback that they 

viewed employment with Kimly as a steady rice 

bowl in very uncertain times. 

We enhanced our leave provisions and allowances 

to help our staff cope with COVID-19. Elderly and 

other staff who needed assistance, such as those in 

the high risk category, were granted additional paid 

leave, which totalled more than 62,000 man-hours.

Sustainability Philosophy in Foodservice

Our sustainability philosophy is anchored by the Economic, Social and Environment pillars. We adopt 

a sustainable food value chain perspective insofar as for every stage of the production and service 

processes, we carefully consider how we create economic value, impart broad-based benefits to 

the community and minimise the environmental impact. For instance, we reviewed food options to 

cater to smaller groups in FY2020, in view of the Singapore government’s guidelines on limiting social 

gatherings and the consequent shift towards take-out and online ordering of meals. We looked at this 

as a new business opportunity that met a clear social need. Furthermore, we assessed how best to 

produce the new menu items efficiently while minimising food waste.

Kimly’s Sustainability Story




005

Sustainability Report 2020



Economic Pillar

We aim to be financially sustainable over the long-

term so that we have resources and reserves to 

invest for the future and prepare for rainy days. 

We generate economic value-add and contribute 

to societal prosperity, creating stable and 

meaningful job opportunities in the communities 

where we operate. We play a year-round role in 

feeding families and workers, and hold our place 

in the food and beverage ecosystem in supporting 

our suppliers and vendors, thus enriching the 

diversity of offerings for our customers. 

Social Pillar

We see ourselves as a responsible corporate 

citizen that shares a symbiotic relationship with 

the local community. We serve nutritious, tasty 

and affordable meals throughout Singapore, 

we provide a safe and conducive environment 

for our employees and customers, we engage 

the grassroots organisations and residents to 

ensure that our hawker culture continues to 

thrive and meet their needs, and we do our part 

in charitable giving and supporting those in need. 

Through community giving and building our 

brand recognition, members of the public across 

the social spectrum will patronise our food and 

beverage outlets, recommend our food options 

to their families and friends, and some will even 

join us as loyal employees. 

Environmental Pillar 

As our business grows, we closely monitor 

the use of raw materials, water, electricity and 

natural gas. This not only makes good business 

sense in reducing our operating expenses, it 

is the environmentally responsible thing to 

do in reducing our ecological footprint and 

amount of waste generated. We constantly look 

at implementing new technologies in various 

aspects of our business that can improve 

efficiency and customer experience. We also look 

at new ways to reduce waste at various stages of 

the production and consumption value chain. In 

April 2020 during the Circuit Breaker period, we 

foresaw higher usage of plastic containers for 

takeaway orders and started a Bring-Your-Own 

Container campaign where Kimly Zi Char offered 

a 20-cent discount on each dish ordered. This 

initiative to reduce plastic waste was well-received 

with more than 17,000 discount redemptions.

Oversight and Structure

Kimly’s Board of Directors provides strategic oversight for our sustainability strategy. This includes 

overseeing the engagement of stakeholders and approving the identification of sustainability-related 

material issues. This allows the Board to have a good feel of ground sentiments and respond quickly to 

market conditions. The Board provides ongoing guidance to Management on effective implementation 

and monitoring of the relevant sustainability-related initiatives and indicators.

Sustainability Report 2020



Risk Management and Socio-economic 

Compliance

Risk management is a critical pillar of good 

corporate governance. Kimly’s Board of Directors 

is responsible for ongoing efforts to identify risks 

that have a material impact on our operations 

so that the Company can take necessary steps 

to mitigate and manage such risks. This includes 

addressing 

sustainability-related 

risks 

along 

environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) 

dimensions. Examples of such risks include 

compliance with waste disposal regulations and 

ensuring that we minimise the occurrence of 

safety incidents that could pose a threat to life 

and limb. 

The Group strictly complies with all applicable 

national and local laws and regulations, including 

those related to labour and employment, child 

labour, non-discrimination, occupational health 

and safety, and the environment. In addition, 

Kimly does not procure or use any prohibited 

chemicals or ingredients. In FY2020, there were no 

reported cases of Socio-economic non-compliance 

in the Group, maintaining our achievement of zero 

Socio-economic non-compliance since FY2018. 

We 

played 

our 

part 

in 

supporting 

the 

Government’s 

COVID-19 

regulations 

and 

advisories, such as reminding customers to don 

masks when they were not consuming food and 

beverages at our outlets, as well as disseminating 

information to the more than 100 self-operated 

stalls in our network of outlets.  

Anti-Corruption

Kimly’s corporate policy is to have zero tolerance 

for any form of corrupt behaviour or practices, 

in line with our operating principles of integrity, 

responsibility and accountability, as well as full 

compliance with all anti-corruption laws and 

regulations. 

Our Employee Code of Conduct provides clear 

guidelines for all staff to adhere to in their 

dealings with customers, business partners and 

other colleagues. Our stand against corruption 

and bribery is also clearly communicated to all 

our business partners and suppliers before and 

during their dealings with our Group. 

In FY2020, there were no reported cases of 

corruption. 

Reporting Scope

Kimly has chosen to adopt the Global Reporting 

Initiative (“GRI”) Reporting Standards as the GRI 

is globally recognised and the latest standards 

allow us to identify and report topics relevant to 

our industry and context. This report has been 

prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: 

Core option. It covers our operations in Singapore 

for the period 1 October 2019 to 30 September 

2020. 

The report covers all five primary components 

of report content as set out by the SGX’s 

requirements on sustainability reporting. These 

components are: 

• 

Material Topics.

• 

Policies, Practices and Performance.

• 

Board Statement. 

• 

Targets. 

• 

Framework. 

GRI does not mandate external assurance for 

sustainability reports prepared in accordance 

with their standards. Kimly had chosen not to seek 

external assurance for this year’s report, bearing 

in mind that FY2020 had been a challenging year 

and we needed all hands on deck to cope with the 

COVID-19 situation operationally. Nevertheless, 

we keep an open mind and will consider seeking 

external assurance of our sustainability report in 

the future.

Stakeholder Engagement

Stakeholder engagement and responding to their feedback and needs are part and parcel of Kimly’s way of doing business 

and ensuring long-term success. There are several groups of stakeholders with whom we engage regularly through formal 

and informal platforms. Their feedback and suggestions will help Kimly to adjust our business strategy and operate in a 

transparent and accountable manner. The following table summarises our key stakeholders, engagement platforms and 

their areas of concern.

Materiality Assessment

Sustainability Report 2020





Materiality Assessment

The Group takes the view that sustainable growth is 

contingent on meeting and exceeding the expectations of 

our key stakeholders. Our material sustainability factors 

are those with significant economic, environmental, social 

and governance impacts, and which would influence the 

assessment and decision making of the stakeholders.

We go through a rigorous process in identifying the material 

factors annually:

•  

We listened to our stakeholders and took into 

consideration their areas of concern.

•  

We used our Sustainable Food Value Chain as the 

broader canvas to identify specific economic, social 

and environmental issues.  

•  

We considered current developments and trends, 

such as the need to support the local community in 

response to the COVID-19 crisis. 

 

The Group’s Sustainability Task Force shortlisted the material 

factors and studied their impact. The final list of material 

factors was reviewed and approved by the Board, which 

then guided the Task Force in dealing with the challenges. 

The material factors for FY2020 were as follows: 

•  

Food Health and Safety

•  

Customer Satisfaction

•  

Pioneering Innovation

•  

Energy and Emissions Management*

•  

Water Management*

•  

Effluents and Waste Management*

•  

Supplier Social Management

•  

Supporting the Local Community

*  

In this report, we have grouped these 3 factors under “Minimising 

Environmental Impact”. This reflects our corporate approach in 

tracking and managing these related issues in an integrated manner.

Sustainability Performance




011

Sustainability Report 2020



As a reputable food service provider, maintaining 

high standards in food health and safety remains 

our topmost priority. The Group is extremely 

stringent in our food safety standards and 

practices, and we comply with all applicable 

food safety regulations. We strive to have a zero-

incident rate by prioritising cleanliness and food 

hygiene in our daily operations. Achieving and 

maintaining high quality and safety standards 

along our food value chain is essential in 

delivering quality cooked food that is nutritious 

and safe for consumption.

Supplier Selection

The Group is judicious in our selection of suppliers 

and food vendors. Because of the COVID-19 

situation in FY2020, we needed to ensure that 

our suppliers could reliably and safely deliver our 

raw produce and other materials on time and 

according to our requirements. Product quality 

and reliability of suppliers’ services such as 

timeliness of delivery are essential in our supplier 

selection to ensure the freshness, quality and 

safety of our ingredients. 

Another supplier assessment criterion is the total 

pricing which includes unit price, payment terms 

and rebates offered to ensure the economic 

sustainability of our food value chain.

Procurement Process

Our procurement process covers the following areas:

• 

Inventory control.

• 

Storage of goods.

• 

Vendors’ feedback.

• 

Receipt of goods.

• 

Products purchased from approved 

suppliers’ list.

• 

Month-end inventory report.

The Group procures only from approved suppliers 

that produce, package, store and deliver products 

in accordance with good manufacturing practices 

prevailing in their respective industries. To ensure 

freshness of our food, we prioritise local suppliers 

with at least a “B” Grade from the Singapore Food 

Agency (“SFA”). Suppliers are expected to provide 

goods and services that consistently meet our 

required specifications, especially for product 

quality and timeliness of product delivery.

In order to offer our customers healthier food 

choices, we had been procuring primarily from 

suppliers of healthier ingredients. Our main 

supplier for vegetable oil and rice participated in 

the Health Promotion Board (“HPB”)’s Healthier 

Ingredient Development Scheme (“HIDS”). The 

Group had made brown rice as an available option 

at our Mixed Vegetable Rice Stalls to better serve 

customers who preferred the nutritional option 

of 

wholegrain. 

Health-conscious 

customers 

could request for less oil at our Zi Char outlets 

as well as hot drinks with less or no sugar at our 

coffeeshops and food courts. 

During the Circuit Breaker period, we introduced 

the “Skinny Me” and “Healthy Me” lower-calorie 

Combo options that customers could order 

through the various online delivery platforms. 

 

Food Health and Safety




KIMLY LIMITED

Food Storage

The Group implemented comprehensive food 

storage policies to keep our food products fresh 

and wholesome. Our central kitchens adopted a 

minimum inventory policy, and most of the semi-

finished food products were prepared and sent to 

our food stalls daily via chilled delivery trucks to 

maximise freshness of the food products.

In addition, ingredients at our food stalls were 

kept in chillers and freezers and the temperatures 

monitored daily. Expiry dates on the food and 

ingredient packaging were checked before use. This 

ensured that the storage conditions were optimised 

to maintain the freshness of the ingredients.

Food Preparation

Kimly adopted very stringent food hygiene 

practices and guidelines during food preparation. 

Daily inspections were conducted on all food 

handlers to monitor their health and personal 

hygiene. The food manufacturing division, food 

delivery vehicles and food storage areas were 

inspected daily for cleanliness and orderliness. 

Food handlers who returned from medical leave 

were checked by the supervisor to ensure that all 

symptoms were cleared before they commenced 

work. All employees involved in food preparation 

had to comply with these practices. Employees 

involved in handling food were required to pass 

the accredited Basic Food Hygiene Course.

Outlet Management

Kimly would procedurally inform all food stall 

owners of the importance of health and safety 

compliance before leasing a stall to them. This 

ensured consistent food safety awareness and 

practices. Each food stall was monitored by 

Assistant Executive Chefs who ensured that the 

food products sent from our central kitchens 

were properly handled according to the Standard 

Operating Procedures (“SOPs”).

We have a quality and compliance assurance team 

(“QC Team”) comprising executive chefs of each 

food division and headed by the Head of Outlet 

Operations. The QC Team periodically conducted 

surprise visits at each outlet and food stall. 

Photographs of non-compliance with regulations 

were taken with supporting notes recorded by 

our administration team. Immediate rectification 

actions would have to be taken and these actions 

were monitored, recorded and verified by Head 

of Outlet Operations before closing the case. 

This ensured food vendors’ compliance with 

the SOPs in areas of food storage and supplier 

management.









Food Health and Safety




013

Sustainability Report 2020



In FY2020, out of the 220 food establishments – 

this included food shops, food stalls as well as 

Rive Gauche and Tonkichi outlets – that were 

inspected by the SFA, 48 stalls achieved the “A” 

grading under the SFA’s grading system for 

licensed food retail establishments while 172 

stalls achieved the “B” grading. None of our 

establishments received lower than a “B” grading. 

Following the increased scrutiny and stepped 

up checks on food establishments due to the 

COVID-19 situation, there were 30 SFA and 7 SDO 

("Social Distancing Officer") recorded offences 

resulting in fines, demerit points and warnings 

in FY2020, as compared to 35 recorded offences 

in FY2019. We had taken necessary actions and 

strengthened the enforcement of proper hygiene 

and safety checks and practices in our outlets to 

prevent recurrence of such incidents.

We supported the Government’s “SG Clean” 

movement by stepping up the frequency of cleaning 

routines in all the outlets. We put in place stringent 

directives for all staff to ensure safety, such as 

daily temperature taking and mandating that staff 

should return home to rest if they were unwell.  

Occupational Health and Safety

The Group has detailed operating procedures in place 

to ensure the safety and health of its employees. 

These guidelines are reviewed periodically to 

safeguard their relevance and effectiveness. 

We believe that our staff should take personal 

responsibility in protecting their own health 

and safety. The Group has a Stay Healthy Award 

programme whereby we offer dining vouchers 

valued at S$208 to each staff who has not 

taken any medical leave or claimed any medical 

expenses. We had seen a steady growth in the 

number of staff who earned the award. In FY2020, 

we distributed S$141,856 of these vouchers to 

682 staff, as compared to 599 staff and 565 staff in 

FY2019 and FY2018 respectively. We will continue 

with the Stay Healthy Award programme in the 

ensuing years. 

The Group provides guidelines to all employees on 

how to respond to various workplace incidents. In 

the event that an employee suffers an injury, he 

or she will receive immediate medical attention 

and the incident will be reported to the Executive 

Director. The head of the department will then 

raise a Corrective Preventive Action Report which 

details the nature of the incident and mitigating 

measures to reduce the risk of future recurrence.

To 

ensure 

that 

uniforms 

and 

protective 

equipment are in good condition, Kimly provides 

replacement attire and gear for our central 

kitchen staff every 6 months. Daily checks are 

conducted at the premises, and key areas such as 

ventilation, lighting, storage and kitchen spaces 

are inspected. 

In FY2020, we spent more than S$100,000 to stock 

up on Personal Protective Equipment (“PPE”), 

sanitizers and thermometers in all outlets. At 

our central kitchen, staff had to don on full PPE 

in the production areas and we had set aside a 

quarantine room for contingency purposes as 

part of the Group efforts to ensure the employees' 

health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The Group provides workmen’s compensation 

insurance to cover work-related injuries sustained 

by employees during their working hours. 

There is also medical insurance for our foreign 

employees to cover their non-work-related 

medical treatment outside working hours.

In line with the social pillar of our sustainability 

philosophy and adopting a sustainable food 

value chain perspective, the Group requires our 

suppliers to provide a safe and healthy working 

environment for their employees. Suppliers are 

encouraged to implement policies that promote 

the general health of employees and prevent 

work-related injuries and illnesses.

Safety is a top priority and we spare no effort to 

mitigate workplace and occupational safety risks. 

In FY2020, there were 11 reported workplace safety 

related incidents, as compared to 10 incidents in 

FY2019. Fortunately, the incidents did not result in 

serious injuries for our staff. We had thoroughly 

investigated each incident, reviewed and improved 

our safety procedures, and reminded our staff 

regularly to place safety first. 

Food Health and Safety




KIMLY LIMITED

At Kimly, customer satisfaction is one of our top 

priorities as it is the key driver to our growth 

and success. We are committed to providing our 

customers with a comfortable, safe and satisfying 

dining experience, and we continually seek to 

improve our service standards through their 

feedback.

Customer Feedback

In FY2020, we received customer feedback 

through 

various 

channels 

such 

as 

our 

Facebook 

page 

(https://www.facebook.com/

kimlycoffeeshop) and website. Our goal is to 

garner positive customer feedback on product 

quality, service and cleanliness at all outlets. We 

actively monitor the feedback and respond to 

serious complaints in a timely manner. We take 

onboard suggestions from customers in our 

service planning, such as healthier food options 

and new locations to open our outlets. 

Customer Safety

Kimly 

is 

committed 

to 

providing 

a 

safe 

environment for our customers when they dine 

at our outlets. We implemented measures to 

protect our customers against safety hazards, 

which included social distancing practices in 

accordance with the government guidelines to 

minimise community transmission of COVID-19. 

There were 5 customer-related safety incidents 

at our outlets in FY2020 as compared to zero 

incidents in FY2019. 4 of the 5 incidents involved 

customers who fell while the fifth incident involved 

a customer impacted by spalling fragments from 

the false ceiling. All 5 incidents were expeditiously 

handled by our insurance company. 

Slippery 

floor 

warning 

signs 

were 

placed 

prominently at areas where floors were more 

susceptible to water spillage and when floors 

were mopped. We took extra care in the selection 

of non-slip floor tiles in all our outlets. A dedicated 

team of general washers are scheduled to visit 

each of our outlets at least once a month to scrub 

the floors and remove excessive dirt and oil. 

Daily checks were conducted to ensure that there 

was no pest breeding or contamination in food 

storage, preparation and consumption areas. 

Customer Satisfaction

Sustainability Report 2020



In FY2020, the Group invested in new technology and equipment to improve efficiency of our 

operations and productivity of our manpower. We incorporated the use of combi ovens at our Mixed 

Vegetable Rice stalls to reduce time and labour costs without compromising the food quality and taste. 

Combi ovens are equipped with three functions, namely convection, steam and combination cooking, 

and they allow multiple food items to be cooked at the same time without the risk of flavour transfer 

and inconsistent cooking results. The use of combi ovens significantly increases the energy efficiency 

of food preparation processes at our outlets. We had a total of 5 combi ovens in FY2020 and would 

purchase more in FY2021 and beyond. 

We developed new menu options – such as “Meals for 2” and promotional sets during special occasions 

like National Day – to capture the growth in takeaway orders. 

 

Pioneering Innovation
















KIMLY LIMITED

016



Kimly regularly monitors the environmental impacts of our various operations and implements 

measures and policies to minimise energy and water consumption, as well as ensure proper 

management of effluents and waste.

Minimising Environmental Impact

Environmental Compliance

The 

Group 

strictly 

complies 

with 

local 

environmental laws and regulations where 

we operate. We require our new and existing 

suppliers to comply strictly with environmental 

laws and practices as well, such as those 

pertaining to waste disposal, air emissions and 

pollution. 

In FY2020, we adhered strictly to the Singapore 

Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”)’s requirements for 

the cleaning and maintenance of Kitchen Exhaust 

Ducts in our outlets. We engaged a qualified 

specialist to do thorough cleaning and keep proper 

records, so as to reduce fire risk and air pollution. 

There were no reported cases of environmental 

non-compliance in the Group and among our 

suppliers, maintaining our achievement of zero 

environmental non-compliance since FY2018.

Energy and Emissions Management

The Group endeavours to maximise our energy 

conservation efforts to reduce our carbon 

footprint 

and 

improve 

the 

environmental 

sustainability of our business. We aim to achieve 

significant results in energy conservation by 

maximising the use of equipment capacity 

whenever possible. 

In FY2020, we continued efforts to reduce energy 

consumption at all outlets, such as replacing 

fluorescent lamps with energy-efficient LED 

lights. We serviced existing equipment regularly 

to improve energy efficiency and maximise the 

effective lifespan. Older equipment would be 

progressively replaced with new and energy-

efficient equipment. 

A total of 20,737,000 kWh of energy was 

consumed on a group-wide level with energy 

intensity of 0.119 kWh per S$ of revenue for 

FY2020, compared with 21,900,000 kWh overall 

consumption and energy intensity of 0.127 kWh 

per S$ of revenue for FY2019. We would continue 

to look for ways to improve our energy efficiency 

in FY2021.  

Our energy consumption generated an estimated 

8,471,065 kg CO2 emissions1 with intensity of 

0.049 kg CO2 per S$ of revenue for FY2020. 

1  

The carbon emissions were computed using Singapore’s 

national Average Operating Margin Grid Emission Factor 

of 0.4085 kg CO2/kWh for 2019, as published by the 

Energy Market Authority (“EMA”).

Sustainability Report 2020



Water Conservation 

The Group endeavours to reduce water wastage 

in our business. This not only makes our 

operations more efficient, it is our contribution 

to Singapore’s national water conservation drive. 

In FY2020, more than 80 dishwashing machines 

had been installed in our outlets to wash glasses 

and cups more efficiently. These machines use a 

collection tank and filtration system to cleanse 

and reuse the water, thus lowering the water 

usage. 

Our total water consumption in FY2020 stood 

at 673,000 m3 on a group-wide basis with water 

usage intensity of 0.004 m3 per S$ of revenue, 

comparable to water consumption of 679,000 m3 

and usage intensity of 0.004 m3 per S$ of revenue 

in FY2019. We would continue to improve on our 

water usage practices in FY2021. 

Effluents and Waste Management

In FY2019, the Group incorporated eco-design 

in the development of new coffeeshops. In 

FY2020, we continued the policy of using recycled 

packaging materials in the design of our new 

coffeeshops to reduce the environmental impact 

of our operations. 

The Group segregated paper cartons and 

aluminium from the rest of the waste generated 

for recycling and explored new uses for these 

materials. Empty aluminium drink cans were 

recycled and empty bottles were reused to store 

various sauces.

Recyclable food grade delivery boxes were used 

to deliver semi-finished food products from the 

central kitchens to our food stalls throughout 

Singapore. These boxes could be used multiple 

times, thus reducing the total amount of 

packaging materials needed. 

We encouraged our food stalls to store used 

cooking oils in separate containers. These were 

collected by licensed collectors to recycle the oil 

into industrial soaps and detergents.

We implemented recycling programmes at the 

outlets and encouraged vendors and customers 

to use less plastic bags, containers and utensils. 

Following the move to reduce plastic straws 

usage, we rolled out new cup lid designs that 

eliminate the need for plastic straws.

We minimised wastage of food ingredients and 

raw materials by using a real-time e-ordering 

system throughout our network. This also 

ensured that ingredients would be fresh when 

delivered to the outlets.  












KIMLY LIMITED

018



To develop the social aspects of our sustainable food value chain, we requested our suppliers to 

implement fair employment practices and policies to protect their employees. Furthermore, our 

suppliers had to provide assurance that they comply with all employment-related and applicable laws 

and regulations. 

In FY2020, there were no reported negative social impacts along the supply chain. Because of the close 

relationships built up over the years between Kimly and our suppliers, our supply chain continued to 

function smoothly. When Malaysia imposed the border lockdown in March 2020, we worked closely 

with our suppliers to prioritise our materials and we made operational adjustments, such as scheduling 

deliveries in night. We built up our stocks and procured in bulk. Our practice of using a group of 

suppliers rather than depending on a single supplier helped as well. We continued our longstanding 

practice of paying our suppliers on time so as not to have any adverse impact on their cashflow. 

Supplier Social Management

Supporting The Local Community

Paying It Forward

During the peak of the COVID-19 situation, we 

supported the community by lowering our prices. 

We had a May Day promotion in which we gave 

a 30-cent drink discount with a minimum food 

purchase of S$3. We subsequently launched 

another 20-cent drink discount promotion in 

July 2020 with a minimum spend of S$3 on any 

takeaway order. Both promotions saw good 

uptake with more than S$138,500 in redemptions. 

We collaborated with DBS Bank Limited and 

FoodBank Singapore from May to July 2020 to 

support FoodBank Singapore’s “Feed The City” 

community engagement event to reduce food 

insecurity, a total of 3,099 packs of food were 

distributed to needy residents in the heartlands.

In addition to the collaboration with FoodBank 

Singapore, we supported various charitable and 

non-profit organisations and causes, such as the 

annual President’s Challenge, the Club-100 @ 

North West initiative by North West Community 

Development Council that provided food rations, 

food vouchers and cooked meal delivery for low 

income residents, as well as the annual “Charity 

Walk for Rice” event in the Yuhua Constituency. 

We continued our monthly contributions to 

the SBL Vision Family Service Centre based in 

Tampines that provides counselling, group work 

and other services to families and individuals 

who are facing challenges in life. Our charitable 

contributions amounted to a total of S$199,800 

for FY2020.  

Creating Employment and Job 

Opportunities

In FY2020, we expanded our operations in 

various localities, which allowed us to provide 

additional employment opportunities. Our policy 

is to actively hire locals to take up the various 

job positions that come with the opening of a 

coffeeshop. Of the 1,379 Singaporean Citizens 

and Permanent Residents that made up 64.6% 

of our total workforce in FY2020, 204 were part-

timers. Most of these locals were deployed in our 

various food outlets, including the part-timers 

who required flexible schedules for their personal 

and other commitments.  

Some of the self-operated food stall owners in our 

coffeeshops and food courts had encountered 

cashflow issues because of COVID-19. We assisted 

by offering rental concessions and referring them 

to various Government assistance schemes.
