Board Statement 

The Board is pleased to present our fourth Sustainability Report for Khong Guan Limited (“KGL”) and its 

subsidiaries, and associates, for the financial year ended 31 July 2021 (“FY2021”). 

This Report is set out on a "comply or explain” basis in accordance with Rule 711B and Practice Note 7.6 

of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Manual on Continuing Listing 

Obligations. This Report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI reporting guidelines, at "Core” 

option. Corresponding to GRI’s emphasis on materiality, the Report highlights the key environmental, 

social and governance (“ESG”) related initiatives carried out by the Company throughout a 12-month 

period, from 1 August 2020 to 31 July 2021. 

In defining our reporting contents, we have applied the GRI principles by considering the Group’s 

activities, impacts as well as expectations and interests of our stakeholders. We observe the following 

four principles: materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability index and completeness. For 

reporting quality, we observed the principles of balance, comparability, accuracy, timeliness, clarity and 

reliability. The ESG data and information provided have not been verified by an independent third party. 

The relevant data has been obtained from reports generated from internal accounting systems and we 

have relied on internal data monitoring and verification to ensure accuracy. 

 

As we continue to navigate the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic in FY2021, the Board has, in its 

review of the Group’s operations, believes that Occupational Health and Safety of our employees 

continues to be of key importance in ensuring the continued growth and sustainability of our operations.  

 

Additionally, the Board has also embraced the view that the Group should embark on a practical and 

measured approach in adopting the use of more sustainable energy sources in its operations, particularly 

that of its energy-intensive entities, in order for the Group to play its part in minimizing our carbon 

footprint, and contribute to the fight against climate change.  

 

The Board is committed to further incorporating sustainability into our business decisions, and assures 

our stakeholders of our commitment in conducting our business in a transparent and sustainable way. 

 

We welcome feedback from our stakeholders with regards to our sustainability efforts as this will enable 

us to improve our policies, systems and results. Please send your comments and suggestions to 

enquiries@kg.com.sg

Approach to Sustainability 

The Group carries out regular brain storming sessions with its senior staff and external stakeholders to 

determine the values each entity finds important today, and then visualize these values and maps them 

against existing sustainability targets and material ESG factors that we will establish on an ongoing basis. 

 

Our Material Assessment of ESG factors was determined by the following steps : 

 

1) 

Identification of the list of ESG factors that were relevant to the operations of the Group. 

2)  Prioritization of the ESG factors identified by representatives from the subsidiaries and 

associates.  

3) Validation of the material ESG factors identified by the subsidiaries and associates and 

presented to the Board for validation. 

4) Review of the material ESG factors approved by the Board will continue to be reassessed in the 

successive reporting period in order to ensure that these matters remain relevant and material 

to our operations. 

 

Occupational Health and Safety 

For FY 2021, we have deemed the material ESG factors identified in our previous reporting as still being 

relevant to the Group today.  Indeed, the Group has recognised Occupational Health and Safety as a key 

material ESG factor today in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

Energy 

With the longer term challenges posed by climate change, the Group has commenced the search for 

solutions for a sustainable way of powering our operations.  In conjunction, we will begin taking a 

measured approach in minimizing our carbon footprint by replacing some of the traditional energy 

requirements of operating our production facilities with sustainable energy sources.  These will be 

conducted in a more calculated approach as there are differing challenges for each operation and we will 

have to conduct careful review before deciding on each of the best approaches to consider.

Material Assessment 

 

Economic 

 

SHC maintains a network of distributors and manufacturers for starches, wheat flour and food products 

in Malaysia. 

 

In East Malaysia, we operate through TGF where our strength lies in our distribution network across all 

major towns in Sabah.  We supply and deliver a wide range of fast moving consumer products such as 

flour, cooking oil, dairy products and enable our customers to enjoy the ease of having a single supply 

source for the majority of their food products. Building on this strength, TGF continues to expand upon 

its range of products. 

 

UMF serves a wide clientele base, from small-medium enterprises to large-scale multinational 

manufacturers through an extensive distribution network that spans the Peninsular and East Malaysia, as 

well as Singapore and Thailand while its subsidiary FOM, and in turn FOM’s subsidiaries, CPM, and KGVO 

supplies quality oats, cereals, and vegetable oil products to consumers around the ASEAN region and other 

parts of the world.

Environmental 

 

Energy and Water 

Being a stakeholder in the environment in which we operate in, the Group will continue to monitor 

electricity and water usage to ensure they do not vary greatly from the previous year despite these costs 

are currently deemed not to be material to our business units. 

 

Solar Energy 

The Board has embraced the view that the Group should embark on a practical and measured approach 

in adopting the use of more sustainable energy sources in its operations in order to minimize our carbon 

footprint. This will be implemented only after further studies have been conducted on the extent and 

practicality of each of the Group’s business units and which operations are suited for such endeavors.  

 

A positive example of the cost benefits of having sustainable energy to power our operations was reflected 

in the energy savings enjoyed by Khong Guan Vegetable Oil Refinery Sdn. Berhad (“KGVO”), a wholly 

owned subsidiary of FOM.  KGVO is involved in the repacking and trading of vegetable oils.  While the 

operations of KGVO are not considered to be energy intensive, it has the necessary infrastructure for the 

Group to conduct a trial on the cost benefit of using solar energy, a renewable source of energy. 

 

The following are data collected by KGVO pre-and-post implementation of solar energy, illustrating the 

reduction of traditional energy source (from Tenaga Nasional) through the usage of solar energy. The roof-

mounted solar panels were commissioned at KGVO in February 2021.

Khong Guan Limited Sustainability Report 2021   -   15 

Child Labour &amp; Forced or Compulsory Labour 

We do not tolerate the use of child labour, nor exploitation of children, in any of our operations and 

facilities. Child labour, as defined by the International Labour Organisation (“ILO”) Convention is “work by 

children under the age of 12; work by children under the age of 15 that prevents school attendance; and 

work by children under of age of 18 that is hazardous to the physical or mental health of the child”. 

 

We do not employ children that fall into the definition as stipulated by ILO Convention. 

 

We do not conduct business with partners who do not share our views on zero tolerance for child labour.

Occupational Health and Safety 

COVID-19 Safety and Response Protocols  

 

The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health crisis, afflicting many countries and causing them to 

impose varying degree of social and movement restrictions such as the movement control orders imposed 

in Malaysia.  Such restrictions adversely impacted businesses and disrupt operations and the supply chain.  

We have therefore put in place Safety measures which are continuously updated at our subsidiaries and 

associates operating in Malaysia in order to safeguard the health and safety of our personnel, as well to 

minimize disruptions to our operations.  Some of these measures are: 

 

Workplace 

1. Provision of temperature screening devices. 

2. Provision of facemasks. 

3. Provision of hand sanitizers. 

4. MySejahtera must indicate LOW RISK or CASUAL CONTACT (without symptoms) before allow entry. 

5. Daily disinfection of common areas (production, door knobs and staircase handrails etc.). 

6. Demarcation – 1 meter physical distancing. 

7. Weekly submission SOP compliance report to MITI (Ministry of International Trade and Industry).  

  8. Updating of COVID-19-related information through announcements, posters, operation workers toolbox 

talks and safety bulletins. 

9. Encourage virtual meetings with third parties. 

10. COVID-19 Emergency Response Protocol.

Training and Education 

The Group has internal processes to ensure risks are minimized and that all potential hazards are identified 

and precautions are taken. 

 

The Group has formal management meetings at least every quarter together with the health and safety 

committee in order to update workplace safety protocols.  If there are new products or equipment to be 

launched or purchased, as the case may be, more management meetings will be held.  These activities are 

carried by staff appointed to the Group’s safety committee (“Safety Committee”). 

 

UMF and its subsidiaries and associates conduct safety training programmes annually. Key personnel were 

provided with a total of 95 hours of training in FY2021, covering Halal executive training; regulations on 

food labelling, nutrition labelling and claims; anti bribery and corruption; amendments on Industrial 

Relations Act and Employment Act; tax coaching workshop and efficient freight management. 

 

Access management 

Access to the Group’s facilities and offices is granted via an access card system with visitors requiring visit 

permits. The access control system will only provide cards to new employees after job confirmation with 

the Group. New employees prior to formal job confirmation will be registered as visitors. COVID-19 

Response Protocols have also been incorporated into the access management at our subsidiaries, and 

associates, in Malaysia.

Ill-health related to work 

The Group documents all workplace-related health-related incidents along with a medical report. The 

Safety Committee will study how to avoid a recurrence of an incident and if deemed necessary, updated 

safety guidelines will be drafted by the Safety Committee for further dissemination and training. 

 

Management strives to ensure that the health and safety of our employees is at the top of our priorities 

at every level of the Group. KGL and all its subsidiaries abide by government and industry health and safety 

regulations. We have adequate training for the workforce so that they may carry out their duties safely 

and confidently. 

 

Environmental matters are one of the issues KGL takes most seriously and the Group remains committed 

to minimizing our environmental impact in all areas of the Group’s operations while preserving and 

enhancing the quality of life for employees, customers and the communities in which we operate. 

 

Labour Practices and Grievance Mechanisms 

The Group has a clear labour grievance procedure. Any affected staff can raise concerns with their Head 

of Department which will be forwarded to higher management if required. 

 

All employees are subject to an annual performance review and are given constructive feedback for their 

future development. 

 

Governance 

Corporate Governance and Risk Management 

Please refer to our Risk Management Policies and Processes in accordance with the Singapore Exchange’s 

Code of Corporate Governance of our financial statements for the financial year ended 31 July 2021 for 

further details. 

 

Regulatory Compliance 

Throughout FY2021, there have been no major incident of non-compliance with the socioeconomic 

goals, laws and regulations we have identified as relevant to the Group, which are described in 

more detail throughout this report. 

 

Practices to manage regulatory compliance 

Laws and regulations relevant to our operations are mainly the Companies Act (Chapter 50) Listing 

Rules of the Singapore Exchange, Securities &amp; Futures Act (Cap. 289) and other relevant legislations that 

may be promulgated from time to time by the Singapore and Malaysia government. The Group believes 

in instilling its employees with a culture of compliance and a high standard of ethics in carrying out their 

duties. This would mitigate any non-compliance as we understand good governance would allow the 

Group to manage its risks and opportunities, and deliver sustainable returns or value for our stakeholders.

Employees 

All employees are briefed on the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, and the Whistleblowing policy 

during the orientation and induction programme. KGL and its subsidiaries receive regular updates from 

relevant authorities on changes to regulations, which are relevant to its operations. Staff members may 

also attend seminars to familiarise themselves with any such updates. 

 

Developed and implemented a Board Assurance Framework with an Enterprise 

Risk Management Framework 

The Group regularly review its operations to identify significant risks it faces, the potential 

impact and likelihood of such risks, and the effective action plans undertaken to mitigate those 

risks. 

 

Results of Monitoring Effectiveness 

Audit Committee (“AC”) and the Board reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls 

in relation to significant risks, including financial, operational, compliance-related controls, as 

well as the risk management system and found them to be adequate and effective as at 31 July 

2021. 

 

Perpetual Target 

The Group aims to maintain “zero” incidents of non-compliance with laws and regulations. 

 

Performance for FY2021 

We had maintained a near “100%” compliance, save for an incident reported at UMF, that occurred on 

4th June 2021, where 4 general workers had entered the premises of UMF failing to scan their MySejahtera 

app. There was a random check of the premises conducted by the Multi-Ministry task force on the day of 

incident. UMF was imposed a fine of RM5,000 for this incident. The workers involved as well as the 

security personnel who had allowed the lapses were disciplined and all staff were reminded to ensure 

such incidences would not repeat. HR department now conducts regular monitoring at the access point 

when staff come in for their shifts. There have been no further incidences since 4th June 2021.
