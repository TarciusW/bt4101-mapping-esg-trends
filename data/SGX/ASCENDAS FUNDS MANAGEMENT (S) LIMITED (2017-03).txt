We are pleased to publish Ascendas Reit’s fifth Sustainability Report. 

This year, we have taken some preliminary steps towards Integrated 

Reporting. In our Annual Report, we have presented our business 

model, highlighting how we draw on the six types of capitals 

and employ our three-pronged strategy to create value for our 

stakeholders. 

In line with this, we have organised our sustainability report based 

on the capitals, with a focus on value creation in the areas of 

Environment, Social and Governance (ESG). The Board recognises 

that adopting best practices in the areas of ESG will lead to more 

resilient and sustainable business operations and performance in 

the long term. 

Every year, we review our material issues, taking into account the 

business environment, our business objectives and stakeholder 

feedback. In our latest review, we further prioritised and grouped 

our material issues into six key issues that we believe are critical 

to achieving our strategic objectives: Corporate Governance, 

Security of Information, Health &amp; Safety Protection of Stakeholders, 

Employment Practices, End-to-End Premium Quality Solutions &amp; 

Customer Satisfaction, and Energy and Carbon Footprint. 

This year, we also surveyed our investment community to find out 

which areas they deem most important in their assessment of 

Ascendas Reit.  They have identified Corporate Governance, Security 

of Information, Employment Practices and End-to-End Premium 

Quality Solutions &amp; Customer Satisfaction, as material ESG issues 

in creating value over time. In our next report, we will provide more 

insights on them.

Maintaining high standards of corporate governance has always 

been a key focus of the Board. This is reflected in the robust 

corporate governance framework and our zero tolerance towards 

lapses in non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For 

greater transparency, we have expanded on our risk management 

framework on pages 107 to 111 of our annual report.

Our business strategy is linked closely to our sustainability 

targets. For example, we continuously strive to improve customer 

satisfaction, which we believe will have a sustainable and positive 

impact on the performance of Ascendas Reit. Two years ago, we 

embarked on a holistic service culture programme in Singapore, 

endorsed by senior management of Ascendas Funds Management 

(S) Limited (the Manager of Ascendas Reit) and the Ascendas-

Singbridge (ASB) Group. The programme, which has now been 

rolled out to all frontline employees of the Manager, the Property 

Manager and outsourced security and cleaning staff, is gradually 

being rolled out to backroom operation employees to ensure that 

our service culture values are internalised and embraced by the 

entire organisation. 

Under the direction of the Board, Ascendas Reit’s sustainability 

approach has been formulated to strike a balance between financial 

results, social engagement and environmental stewardship. We will 

continually identify, manage and address ESG factors material to the 

business as we believe that this will enable us to build a sustainable 

business model that will positively serve our large and diverse 

groups of stakeholders over the long term.

In line with our sustainability efforts, we have printed limited hard 

copies of the annual and sustainability reports. Electronic versions 

of the reports are available on Ascendas Reit’s website at www.

ascendas-reit.com.

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES  

DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD

ABOUT THIS REPORT

This is the fifth annual sustainability report published by Ascendas Reit in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 guidelines 

– core, and the GRI Construction and Real Estate Sector Supplement (CRESS). Initial steps have also been taken to incorporate elements 

from the International Integrated Reporting &lt;IR&gt; Framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council in illustrating Ascendas 

Reit’s business model, as summarised on pages 14 to 17 of the annual report. 

The report focuses on Ascendas Reit’s core activity as a business space and industrial REIT. The scope of this report covers its business 

operations and properties in Singapore, Australia and China1, recording the performance from 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017. Ascendas 

Reit has a strong focus on a broad range of industrial property investments including Business &amp; Science Parks, Integrated Development, 

Amenities &amp; Retail (IDAR) Properties, High-Specifications Industrial Properties, Light Industrial Properties and Flatted Factories and 

Logistics &amp; Distribution Centres. As at 31 March 2017, Ascendas Reit had 131 properties in Singapore and Australia (please refer to page 54 

and 55 of the annual report for a full list of Ascendas Reit’s properties). External assurance has not been sought for this reporting period.

In August 2016, ASB Group launched a new family of corporate logos 

to refresh its brand image post the completion of the merger in 

2015. The new Ascendas Reit logo, which incorporates the infinity 

symbol, provides a clearer connection to our Sponsor, the Ascendas-

Singbridge (ASB) Group, and other affiliated brands.

1 

Data included in the report for the China properties is up to the operating period before divestment, i.e. July 2016 and November 2016 for Ascendas Z-Link and A-REIT City @Jinqiao 

respectively. Its third China property, that was divested in June 2016, was unoccupied and therefore no data was recorded. 

To expand and diversify the portfolio in Australia, the Manager 

acquired one Business Park property, 197-201 Coward Street in 

Sydney (September 2016) and formed a local team of five to assist 

in the management of the Australian portfolio. One Science Park 

property, 12, 14 &amp; 16 Science Park Drive (February 2017) was 

acquired in Singapore, while four properties were divested, namely 

Four Acres Singapore in Singapore (April 2016), and A-REIT Jiashan 

Logistics Centre (June 2016),  Ascendas Z-link (July 2016), and 

A-REIT City @Jinqiao (November 2016) in China.

Several leadership changes were made during the year:

• Mr Lim Hock San, Independent Director, a member of the 

Nominating, Human Resources and Remuneration Committee, 

Investment Committee and the Operational Risk Management 

Committee

• Mr Lawden Tan, Head of Investment and Business Development 

• Mr Harry Yan, Head of Singapore Revenue Management. 

Please refer to pages 25, 28 and 29 in the Annual Report for their 

profiles.

MATERIALITY &amp; STAKEHOLDERS

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

The Manager’s focus has always been to deliver value to stakeholders 

through its business strategies, operational activities and allocation 

of capitals. Insights gathered from stakeholder engagements serve 

to reaffirm the manager's sustainability strategy, enable meaningful 

reporting and improve practices. 

Ascendas Reit’s materiality definition is guided by the GRI reporting 

framework. It states that the report should cover aspects which 

reflect the organisation’s significant ESG impacts, and those 

that substantively influence the assessments and decisions of 

stakeholders. An internal review of the materiality assessment 

was conducted in January 2017 to update Ascendas Reit’s material 

ESG issues. The list of 17 material topics identified in FY15/16 

were further prioritised and topics of similar nature were grouped 

together. A final list of the six most critical ESG matters were 

selected and approved by the Board. 

As an initial step towards integrated reporting, the Manager 

conducted an investor perception survey in February 2017 with 

twenty of its institutional investors and key analysts. The survey 

(conducted by an independent third party research house) required 

the investment community to evaluate and rank the importance of 

ESG issues when deciding whether to invest in Ascendas Reit. Unlike 

the traditional GRI materiality determination process, the &lt;IR&gt; 

Framework focuses on ESG matters that can influence investors' 

assessment on the organisation's ability to create value. Figure 1 

and Table 1 provides more details.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY16/17

HARNESSING ORGANISATIONAL CAPITAL

Organisational Capital refers to the robust corporate governance 

and risk management framework, systems and procedures that 

serve as foundation to all the investment, asset management and 

business decisions.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The Manager believes that the highest standards of corporate 

governance serve as a crucial foundation in delivering value to 

the stakeholders. These standards have been translated into a 

comprehensive and robust corporate governance framework that 

guides the evaluation of strategies, systems, procedures and actions, 

which in turn addresses business risks, boosts performance and 

raises investors’ confidence. 

The Corporate Governance Report, found from pages 98 to 123 of the 

Annual Report, further sets out the corporate governance practices 

for FY16/17 with reference to the principles of the Code of Corporate 

Governance 2012.

Regulatory Compliance

As a listed entity, the Manager has zero tolerance for governance-

related risks. Non-compliance to prevailing laws and regulations, 

such as the SGX listing rules, the Code on Collective Investment 

Schemes issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and 

tax rulings issued by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, 

entails penalties, fines and revocation of capital market services 

licences. Hence the Manager has put in place internal controls and 

procedures to embed compliance into its day-to-day operations, 

while proactively identifying and responding to applicable new rules 

and regulations.

Table 3: Ascendas Reit's Procurement System 



Pre-qualification

Tender

Execution

Review

• Suppliers who do not 

pass the pre-qualification 

screening will not be 

invited for tender.

• The screening criteria 

includes: ISO, bizSAFE 

certificates, financial 

capability and relevant 

track records, Ministry 

of Manpower (MOM) 

demerit points; the 

criteria for labour 

includes guidelines 

set by the Tripartite 

committee (where 

applicable), Clean-mark 

Silver (for cleaning 

providers) and Police 

Licensing &amp; Regulatory 

Department (PLRD) 

minimum B (for security 

providers).

• The second screening 

for potential suppliers is 

conducted at this stage. 

• An evaluation 

Committee, comprising 

representatives of 

specialists, operation 

personnel, procurement 

team and business 

process owners, 

evaluates the suppliers 

based on price and 

quality, using a points 

system.

• All suppliers are 

mandated to comply with 

laws and regulations, 

e.g. Employment Act, 

Workplace Safety and 

Health (WSH) Act and the 

Progressive Wage Model.

• All cleaning vendors have 

to implement incentive 

programmes to reward 

their workers for good 

performance.

• All on-site cleaners, 

technicians and 

security guards are 

required to attend the 

service culture training 

programme so as to 

improve service delivery, 

and develop positive 

working attitudes. 

• Supplier performance is closely 

monitored via the activities stated 

below; results are tracked in the 

enhanced Ascendas Information 

Management System (eAIMS), and 

reflected in the performance rating of 

the suppliers.

1. Site inspections: Include surprise 

night inspections, which serve to 

check on illegal workers staying in 

Ascendas Reit’s premises as well as 

any security guards working without 

licences.

2. Audits (based on OHSAS 18001 

Occupational Health and Safety 

System and SS506 Singapore 

Standard on Occupational Safety and 

Health Management)

• Workplace Safety Audit: Ensures 

conformance to the Property 

Manager’s Occupational Health 

and Safety management system.

• Technical Audit: Ensures works 

completed by suppliers are done 

according to work specifications 

and cost.

3. Monthly/Quarterly review meetings 

• Relevant for suppliers of major 

trades, e.g. cleaning, security and 

landscape.

• Discussion topics: Matters such 

as 

suppliers’ 

performance, 

incident reporting and payment.

• Breaches: warning letters and 

penalty given to suppliers, while 

rectifying the issues with them. 

Contract will be terminated if no 

improvements are made. 

In FY16/17, there were no reported cases of non-compliance with 

laws and regulations, and zero conclusive cases of corruption 

or anti-competitive behaviour (refer to Table 2). Ascendas Reit’s 

high corporate governance standard is widely recognised by the 

community and industry as seen from its sixth consecutive win of 

the Most Transparent Company Award by the Securities Investors 

Association (Singapore) and Silver in Best Investor Relations at the 

Singapore Corporate Awards.

Risk Management

The Manager maintains a structured Enterprise Risk Management 

(ERM) framework to effectively identify, evaluate and manage key 

risks, including key ESG risks such as cyber security threats, and 

property safety and security. The Board is updated on Ascendas 

Reit's overall risk profile and key risk areas on a quarterly basis, 

as well as the assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the 

internal control systems.

Responsible Supply Chain Management

Companies today face growing expectations from stakeholders to be 

responsible for managing ESG risks in their supply chains. Ascendas 

Reit mitigates the social risks along its supply chain with a four-

step procurement system. By subjecting all suppliers to a stringent 

system, Ascendas Reit encourages the continuous improvement of 

supplier performance. This supports value creation in the business 

and the business community. Please see Table 3 for more details.

As at 31 March 2017, Ascendas Reit has 376 active suppliers 

(including maintenance contractors, landscape, cleaning and 

security providers), out of which 61% are based in Singapore and 

38% are based in Australia.

or expansion of tenant leases.

24-hour call centre, which serves as a convenient and accessible point of 

contact for any matters.

Actions

As part of the service culture training 

programme, one-to-one coaching 

was provided for all frontline staff 

(Relationship Managers and Property 

Executives), covering aspects such as 

expected behaviours and individual areas 

of improvements.

Conduct audits on calls received by the call centre and perform monthly 

checks on the feedback and response given by Property Executives.

Results

129 out of 135 responses scored a 

minimum of 3 out of 5.

96 out of 99 responses scored a minimum of 3 out of 5. In particular, Light 

Industrial Properties and Flatted Factories saw a decrease in score due to 

the  change in the cleaning company in January 2017. The settling-in period 

saw a dip in the cleaning service standard but this has been rectified and the 

cleanliness at the washrooms are up to mark. Please refer to Figure 3 for the 

detailed breakdown of the survey.

and upholding high standards in health, safety and security. The 

Manager continues to set targets and embark on initiatives to uphold 

long term relationships with its stakeholders. Please refer to Table 9 

and 10 for FY16/17 targets and results.

HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTION OF STAKEHOLDERS

The protection of the health and safety of stakeholders in the 

Ascendas Reit’s properties is instrumental in building trusted 

relationships. In FY16/17, Ascendas Reit achieved its targets for 

safety and physical security breaches at its properties (please see 

Table 12).

The Property Manager along with the Workplace Safety and Health 

(WSH) Committee, Risk Management Committee (sub-committee of 

WSH) and Risk Assessment Leaders /Internal auditors, commit to 

create a strong safety culture. They have put in place a  Workplace 

Along with the ASB team, the Manager constantly evaluates the 

initiatives that were implemented and determine if they serve 

customers’ needs in the context of the ever-changing market. 

For this reason, the Manager is reviewing the effectiveness of the 

Customer eQTM Benchmarking External Customer Delight survey 

and thus it was not conducted in FY16/17. The Group has engaged a 

consultant to conduct a detailed customer study to identify drivers 

that strengthen customer loyalty and help to win new customers. 

The study is still on-going, and the results and outcomes will be 

further elaborated in the future reports.

Fair Employment Practices

The Manager abides by the 5 Principles of Fair Employment 

Practices under the Tripartite Alliance for Fair &amp; Progressive 

Employment Practices (TAFEP)7 in its interactions with employees 

and contractors. There were no validated cases of discrimination in 

FY16/17 (Table 15). 

As at 31 March 2017, the Manager reported a total staff strength of 

72 people (FY15/16: 74 people). The slight reduction in staff strength 

was attributable to the closure of the China office along with the 

Figure 4: Number of Accidents in Ascendas Reit’s Properties 

In FY16/17, there were nine accidents at Ascendas Reit's properties. 

This is an increase from three accidents in FY15/16, mainly 

attributable to an increase in workplace accidents by five cases 

concerning the contractors. The nature of the accidents varied from 

slip and fall, to being struck by objects and sustaining cuts. There 

were no increase in workplace accidents concerning employees 

during the reporting year. Please see Figure 4 for details.

To prevent similar reoccurrences, the Property Manager took 

immediate actions to issue warning letters to contractors. Re-

trainings were also conducted to remind contractors’ workers 

of safety work habits including wearing appropriate personal 

protective equipment at all times. Other actions include: Danger 

zones are painted to remind workers to be vigilant when working 

in these areas, more frequent inspections are conducted, and Risk 

Assessment and Safety Work Procedures are revised to mitigate 

such risks in the future.

Employee Well-being and Engagement

Highly-engaged employees are more likely to perform at consistently high levels and deliver higher customer satisfaction levels.

Figure 9 depicts the key drivers for employee engagement and the related programmes and platforms to build a highly engaged workforce 

that is driven to achieve organisational goals.

The experience, skills and expertise of the professionals in ASB

LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT

In the face of a competitive landscape, investing in learning is 

necessary to build a strong and talented workforce that is capable of 

delivering value to the stakeholders. The Manager is committed to 

develop its team’s competencies, creativity, experiences and career 

development through various opportunities such as trainings, 

programmes, overseas attachments, job rotations, sponsorships to 

advance their educational and professional qualifications, etc. 

The average training hours per employee has increased from 

19.2 hours in FY15/16 to 30.0 in FY16/17. This was a result of the 

Manager’s investments in training programmes such as the ASB 

Corporate Programme - POWER of One Learning Carnival and 

continuation of the Service Culture Training. Please refer to Figure

Natural Capital refers to the natural resources such as energy and

ENERGY AND EMISSIONS

In November 2016, the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement came into  

force. Singapore10, Australia10 and China10, countries in which 

Ascendas Reit operates in, have ratified this agreement, formalising 

commitments and setting plans in motion to reduce the respective 

emission intensity of their nations. In alignment with the international 

and national direction, the Manager and Property Manager have and 

will continue to place great emphasis on optimising energy usage 

and reducing cost. 

The Manager has set a target to reduce energy intensity by 3% on an 

accumulative basis over a period of 5 years in Singapore (Table 16). 

The Manager's key strategies include:

• Investing in BCA Green Mark11 certified buildings (i.e. BCA’s 

Green Mark  GoldPLUS Rating or equivalent for all new projects 

in Singapore, and a minimum of Green Mark Certification for all 

existing projects)

• Taking pro-active steps to work with tenants to share their 

environmental behaviour and operational practices, through 

the Green Tenant’s Guides which include criteria such as 

requirements on renovation works, repair of water fittings in the 

toilets, and use of energy-efficient light bulbs.

13 Indirect energy (i.e. energy drawn from grid electricity) accounts for most of Ascendas Reit’s energy consumption. As direct energy use (i.e. energy consumed directly from fuels) 

is negligible, this has not been presented in the report.

In FY16/17, the aggregate energy consumption and intensity (Figure 

13) of properties under the operational control of the Property 

Manager decreased by approximately 5.2% from 106.5 million kWh 

to 101.0 million kWh, and approximately 5.8% from 248.6 kWh/sq 

m to 234.2 kWh/sq m. The decrease is in line with the Manager’s 

energy saving efforts, namely: installing variable-frequency drives in 

some of its facilities such as air conditioners, monitoring the energy 

profile of buildings and recommending improvements (e.g. better 

chiller efficiency, changing to LED lights) for those with high energy 

consumption. As a result of the fall in energy consumption, carbon 

emission and emission intensity (Figure 14) have also charted a 

decrease of approximately 5.3% to 43,566 Kg CO2, and approximately 

6.0% to 101.0 Kg CO2/sq m respectively.

to high stressed country16.The Manager recognises the importance 

of conserving water in Ascendas Reit’s countries of operation, and 

has been working closely with the operations team to review its 

water performance and recommend initiatives to improve water 

efficiency. As a result, water consumption and intensity in Singapore 

have shown further decrease in FY16/17 as illustrated in Figure 17. 

In China17, consumption figures have not been pro-rated hence there 

was a significant decrease in consumption and intensity (Figure 18). 

Water consumption and intensity in Australia18 were reported as 

10,522 m3 and 2.3 m3/sq m. Comparative figures will be presented in
