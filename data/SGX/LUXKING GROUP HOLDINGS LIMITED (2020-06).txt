About

This reporT

This is the third sustainability report (the “report”) 

published by Luxking. As with the first two reports, 

this report discloses the Group’s policies, practices, 

targets and performance in terms of the material 

environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) 

topics that the Group has identified. Luxking 

publishes the report annually as mandated by SGX-

ST Listing Rules 711A (“LR 711A”) and as part of 

sustainability communication effort. The report has 

been uploaded to both Singapore Exchange Limited 

(“SGX”) website and Luxking’s corporate website 

(www.newasiatapes.com). 

Reporting Boundary

The report focuses on Luxking’s operations 

relating to the production of BOPP films, IS tapes 

and General Tapes (collectively referred to as 

the “Tapes”) for the financial year ended on 30 

June 2020 (the “reporting year” or “FY2020”). The 

reporting boundary covers the manufacturing facility 

in Zhongshan managed by Luxking.

While the report does not fully cover the Group’s 

operations, Luxking plans to gradually expand the 

scope of its disclosures in the coming reporting 

years.

Reporting Standard

The report is prepared in accordance with the 

“comply or explain” provision of the SGX-ST Listing 

Rules 711 on sustainability reporting, as well as 

the guidance set out in the Practice Note 7.6: 

Sustainability Reporting Guide (“PN 7.6”) issued by 

the SGX. The five reporting components prescribed 

by the SGX-ST Listing Rules 711B (“LR 711B”) 

underpin the key structure of this report. It also 

takes reference from the sustainability reporting 

framework provided by Global Reporting Initiative 

(“GRI”), the GRI Standards (version 2016 and 

2018). The disclosures in this report seek to achieve 

the GRI’s Reporting Principles for defining report 

quality: accuracy, balance, clarity, comparability, 

reliability, and timeliness.

To ensure quality and impartial reporting, Luxking 

commissioned an external consulting company to 

engage our stakeholders and compile the report. 

In line with the material topics confirmed during the 

stakeholder engagement process, selected topic-

specific disclosures are included for enhanced 

reporting. The GRI-SGX Content Index is available 

at the end of this report.

2020 has been a year of upheaval for communities 

and companies around the world, with the 

Covid-19 pandemic bringing about unprecedented 

and substantial disruptions in our daily lives 

and business operations. The Group has faced 

similar challenges in the face of the outbreak. 

In our Zhongshan facility, production had to be 

unprecedentedly stalled for an extended period of 

time.  

In spite of these challenging circumstances, the 

Group has recorded a 5.7% year-on-year net 

revenue increase to RMB 398,400,000 for FY2020. 

We have also adapted to the evolving Covid-19 

situation by instituting emergency response plans 

in accordance with national regulations and best 

practices. As markets gradually open up, the Group 

continues to be vigilant in ensuring that health and 

safety procedures are continuously and diligently 

practised. 

This year has emphasised how the performance of 

the Group is intrinsically linked to social concerns, 

such as the health and safety of our employees, 

local communities and other key stakeholders. It 

has also served as a reminder of the importance 

of sustained risk management and early planning, 

as well as rapid responses to arising crises. In the 

same vein, even as the Group pays close attention 

to the Covid-19 pandemic, we have not lost sight of 

the need to address the ongoing climate emergency.

The Group focuses on the following three areas of 

sustainability for FY2020:

Employee Health and Well-being

The health and well-being of our employees 

are paramount to the continued growth and 

long-term performance of the Group. We are 

committed to safeguarding the health and safety 

of our employees across our operations, and have 

introduced a range of additional disease prevention 

and control protocols in accordance with local 

regulations and best practices to provide a safe 

working environment for our employees.

Continuous Advancement

The Group believes in investing in our employees 

to help them achieve their fullest potential. To this 

end, we conduct regular performance and career 

development reviews across all employee groups. 

Mid-last year, we also conducted an employee 

satisfaction survey among 200 randomly selected 

employees. The survey yielded a result of 80% 

employee satisfaction and the Group’s management 

intends to use the survey results to further improve 

the Company’s talent development programmes.

Environmental Stewardship

As a manufacturer, the Group is deeply aware of the 

impact of our business on the planet and the local 

communities surrounding our operations. We are 

committed to reducing our ecological footprint by 

continuously improving the efficiency and utilisation 

rate of our processes. The Group’s Zhongshan 

facility is currently certified under ISO9001:2015 and 

ISO14001:2015 standards, and has made progress 

in managing our environmental footprint.

Even as we confront an uncertain global business 

environment, the Group thanks our management 

and employees for their commitment to bringing 

Luxking’s sustainability performance to greater 

heights, and our various stakeholders groups for 

their enduring support in our sustainability journey.

During the reporting year, the main means of communication with the abovementioned key stakeholders 

included: compiling and announcing written reports; hosting regular meetings, interviews; direct emails; 

maintaining an opinion and feedback box for factory workers, among others. All face-to-face meetings and 

related activities observed the Group’s Covid-19 health and safety protocols, or were conducted on digital 

platforms.

The Group maintains strong relationships with our key stakeholders by establishing multiple communication 

channels. Stakeholder engagement is essential in informing the Group’s identification of material ESG risks 

and opportunities, enabling us to develop appropriate plans to mitigate anticipated risks and seize arising 

opportunities.

Sustainability risks can have a significant impact on the Group’s long-term performance. To turn these risks 

into opportunities, the Group commits to carefully incorporating them into our strategic decision making. The 

material risks that the Group has identified and the corresponding actions we have taken to mitigate them 

have been summarised in the table below.

Risks

Opportunities

Economic Outlook

The unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic has 

adversely affected the global economy and the 

Group’s operations. Even as countries around 

the world gradually open up, the global economic 

outlook remains uncertain and volatile.

The pandemic has emphasised the link between 

continued economic growth and ESG performance. 

In view of this, we recognise the pressing need 

for the Group to incorporate sustainability 

considerations into our long-term value creation 

strategy. As the Group adapts our operations to 

respond to changing regulations and business 

circumstances, we look towards capturing arising 

opportunities that will enable us to better integrate 

ESG considerations into our current business 

model.

Occupational Health and Safety

In addition to the occupational health and safety 

risks associated with employment in the production 

line, highly-transmissible infectious diseases 

such as Covid-19 pose major health risks to our 

employees. 

The Group considers the management of 

occupational health and safety our moral 

responsibility. We maintain and regularly review a 

safety management system to identify and mitigate 

health and safety risks that may emerge from 

our production line, as well as conduct regular 

safety training and inspections. In response to 

the Covid-19 pandemic, the Group has also 

established emergency response plans and made 

new arrangements for employee health and safety 

training since February 2020.

Talent Retention

Retaining high-performing and talented employees 

within the workforce is crucial to the Group’s 

long-term performance, especially since the 

manufacturing industry is facing increasingly fierce 

competition to recruit and retain skilled workers. 

The loss of skilled employees may disrupt daily 

operation and lead to high costs of replacement. 

The Group has set up policies and procedures to 

ensure employee welfare is safeguarded at all 

times. Talent development is an integral part of 

our talent management strategy and we conduct 

regular performance and career development 

reviews across all employment levels. By 

providing personal and professional development 

opportunities to our employees, the Group stands 

to cultivate a more engaged and committed 

workforce.

Customer Data Management

Data breaches have become, especially with the 

rising rate of cyber attacks. As the Group handles 

customer data on a daily basis, there is an inherent 

risk of customer privacy breaches. This not only 

threatens to erode our customers’ trust in the 

Group, but may also result in customers suffering 

financial loss, amid other adverse impacts.

The Group pays close attention to the systems and 

measures required to keep customer and personal 

data confidential. We continue to implement a 

system of data classification across our operations, 

which informs the requisite security measures and 

degree of access. Authorised access to customer 

data is also only granted to our employees on 

a “need-to-know” basis. By adopting stringent 

information security measures, the Group can 

assure our customers that their personal data will 

be kept confidential to the best of our ability.

Environmental Impact

Due to the nature of the Group’s business, we 

bear the inherent risk of polluting the environment 

in which we operate. This may have an impact 

on surrounding communities, damage our brand 

image, and affect our relationship with our 

customers. Moreover, as climate change becomes 

more palpable globally, the Group faces transition 

risks as local regulations become more stringent in 

reducing production-related emissions.

The Group maintains our pledge to transition to 

clean production and remains compliant with all 

relevant regulatory standards. Chemicals that 

are known to be harmful to the environment 

are banned or strictly controlled to prescribed 

limits. Our operations and employees abide 

by a set of strict protocols, which involve three 

main departments (manufacturing department, 

department of quality control and department of 

environmental quality) in charge of treating, testing 

and monitoring our industrial effluents, to ensure all 

regulatory standards regarding industrial effluents 

are met.

Fair Employment

The Group has maintained a well-defined hiring policy as documented in the Company Recruitment Guide. 

All applicants are required to undergo the application process and Luxking conducts due diligence by 

interviewing candidates and verifying their supporting documents to determine the candidates who best 

fit the available positions. Our hiring policy stipulates that no discrimination is allowed and employment 

decisions should be strictly based on merit alone.

As at 30 June 2020, the BOPP films segment of the Group’s Zhongshan facility employed a total of 77 

employees while the Tapes segment employed a total of 217 employees, all of whom were full-time and 

permanent employees. The Group offers all our full-time employees a range of benefits, such as pension, 

medical insurance, unemployment insurance, work injury insurance and maternity insurance, in accordance 

with the requirements set out in the Labour Law of the PRC, the Social Insurance Law of the People’s 

Republic of China, Regulations on the National Social Security Fund (全国社会保障基金条例), Regulations 

on Unemployment Insurance (失业保险条例) and Interim Measures on Employee Childbirth Insurance (企业

职工生育保险试行办法). No employee was entitled to parental leave during this reporting year.

The number and rate of new hires and employee turnover during the reporting year are summarised in the

Compliance with Labour Standards

The Group strictly prohibits the use of child labour in our operations. To ensure that this is observed, the 

Group has adopted preventive measures against hiring underaged workers by checking their identification 

cards during the recruitment process. Applicants who cannot satisfy the age requirements or provide official 

identification cards are disqualified during the pre-screening segment of the hiring process.

All employees of the Group’s operations are hired on a voluntary and fair basis. The standard working hours 

of our employees are 8 hours per day. The Group has maintained a Requirement on Restricting Overtime 

Hours (对加班时间的限制性规定), under which any overtime arrangement requires prior mutual agreement 

between our employees and their supervisors, and employees will be compensated with leave or allowance.

To safeguard our employees, the Group conducts a range of safety training throughout the year. The Group 

maintains a Safety Production Training System in accordance with the Production Safety Law of the PRC, 

which requires all new hires to undergo at least 48 hours of safety training and pass a safety exam before 

they commence their duties.

During the reporting year, training activities provided to different groups of employees included:

away from their post for more than six months or has been involved in an incident can only resume their role 

after being re-trained and passing the safety examination.

During the reporting year, the Group also organised regular training for all employees during the reporting 

year. Before the introduction of any new equipment, employees are required to familiarise themselves with 

new safety protocols in order to operate the equipment without close supervision.

The Group views safeguarding the health and safety of our employees as a moral responsibility and upholds

The Group’s health and safety management system comprises a set of interrelated safety policies and 

processes which define managerial responsibilities. We have adopted a range of prevention and control 

methods to ensure safety is embedded in all aspects of our operations. The Group’s Occupational Safety 

and Training Protocol also clearly defines the roles and responsibilities at each level of the organisation with 

regard to cultivating a healthy and safe working environment. We regularly assess work-related safety risks, 

as well as conduct non-routine assessments when health or safety incidents arise in relevant industries. 

In addition, our employees are encouraged to raise their concerns and safety suggestions through 

recommendation boxes managed by the Human Resources Department. The Human Resources 

Department is responsible for sending these recommendations to relevant departments for follow-up action.

Safety training is also considered an integral part of the Group’s health and safety management system. 

During the reporting year, we conducted several safety training courses for our managers, in which the 

importance of safe production and mitigation of safety risks were communicated and emphasised. We 

also conduct regular safety training for all employees to educate them on safety protocols and fire drill 

procedures. On top of prevention measures, the Luxking management maintains emergency protocols and 

policies, such as those pertaining to work-related injuries, to ensure quick response and mitigative action.

In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Group also instituted emergency response plans in accordance 

with the Law on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Disease (中华人民共和国传染病防治法) and the 

Emergency Plan for Public Health Emergencies (突发公共卫生事件应急预案) of the PRC. These include 

introducing supplementary health and safety measures which all employees must strictly adhere to, such 

as measuring their temperature, wearing protective masks at all times, following hygiene protocols for 

hand-washing, maintaining safe distancing, banning large gatherings, regularly and thoroughly disinfecting 

equipment, among others. Rapid response mechanisms were also introduced to report, isolate and treat 

suspected or actual cases of Covid-19 in a timely manner to prevent the spread of the disease. 

The overall execution of these emergency response plans was overseen by a dedicated team led by 

Executive Chairman Leung Chee Kwong, with the team’s membership comprising managers of various 

departments. Other dedicated teams were set up to oversee various aspects of the emergency response 

plans, such as inspection, reporting, treatment disinfection and isolation, and were staffed by members of 

the Group’s management.

During the reporting year, the Group continued to maintain an excellent safety track record for the BOPP 

films segment, with zero injuries or fatalities. We strive to achieve the same track record for the rest of our 

factory operations in the coming years.

EnviRonMEntAl

sTewardship

The Group is keenly aware of the environmental impact of our daily operations and implemented various 

mitigation measures to control and reduce these effects.

In accordance with environmental regulations and laws, we have prohibited the use of hazardous materials 

in all of our products, such as asbestos, cobalt dichloride, diarsenic pentaoxide, etc. The Environmental and 

Chemical Substance Management Committee was established to oversee the management of environment-

related risks, and to set up environment and chemical related targets and goals. The Committee, led directly 

by our general manager, is also in charge of assessing suppliers’ environmental risks. The group also takes 

a precautionary approach in our operation by reviewing environmental risks regularly in the production and 

sales meetings.

During the reporting year, the Group also determined that the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification 

will be one criterion when procuring paper supplies.    

 

Water and Effluents

The Group recognises the importance of conserving water and strives to improve water efficiency in our 

operations. We track our monthly usage of water, regularly analyse the causes of water overuse in our 

operations, and set commensurate targets for reduction.

Our Zhongshan factory withdraws water from municipal water supplies for the production of our BOPP 

films and Tapes. Water is used for three main purposes: evaporative cooling; potable water for use by our 

employees; and general cleaning. 

All industrial water is treated in the Group’s on-site tertiary wastewater treatment plant in accordance 

with ISO14001: 2015. During the treatment process, wastewater passes through four treatment tanks: the 

treatment tank, anaerobic tank, storage tank and aerobic tank. The Group’s Quality Control Department 

is responsible for monitoring the quality of treated effluent to ensure compliance with the discharge limits 

of water pollutants. In addition, the Operation works with the local environmental protection authorities to 

monitor and test the treated effluent every year.

Potable water and water used for general cleaning is directly discharged into the municipal sewage system. 

To reduce the solids of our discharged water and minimise pollution, the wastewater outlet in our canteen 

has a filtration screen and an oil trap to remove food debris and grease. The filtered effluent is then 

discharged to the municipal sewage system.

During the reporting year, the Group did not withdraw or discharge water from areas with water stress. A 

summary of the total water withdrawn for both the BOPP films segment and the whole factory has been 

provided below. We have disclosed the total water withdrawn of the whole factory as we currently do not 

have dedicated meters for the Tapes production segment.

Moving forward, the Group intends to continuously improve our water efficiency, with a view of reducing the 

total water usage of the whole factory.

Customer Privacy

Customer data protection and customer privacy has always been a core part of our business strategy. The 

Group approach to protecting customer privacy includes:

•	

Classifying data across our operations into three main categories in accordance to the nature of the 

data. The categories inform the requisite level of security and degree of access.

•	

Employee access to customer data is only granted on a “need-to-know” basis.

•	

All employees are required to protect company’s trade secrets and proprietary information, including 

customer data.

•	

Maintaining a system for registering confidential information, storing such information at a location with 

restricted access, and governing the copying or borrowing of such information with stringent approval 

processes.

These protection measures have been documented in the Employee Handbook to educate our employees.

In the event of a suspected or actual data leak, our employees are required to report to the Human 

Resources Department or management immediately. Depending on the impact or economic loss to the 

Group, the Group reserves our rights to pursue disciplinary actions and request compensation from the 

employees involved.

During this reporting year, the Group did not receive any complaints regarding customer privacy breaches 

and had zero incidents of data breaches in terms of identified leakages, thefts or losses of customer data.
