1. Corporate Development Update 

 

CIHL (Tianjin) Water Development Limited (“Tianjin Water” or “Company”) is an integrated water supply 

company involved in the processing of raw water and reclaimed water, distribution of treated water for 

industrial and domestic no-drinking uses, and the provision of engineering services to clients in Tianjin, 

China. The Company owns its own processing plants and distribution networks. Tianjin Water was 

established in September 2004 and as of 31 December 2018, owns and operates the Beitang Water 

Plant and is in the process of developing a new plant, the Xinhe Water Plant.

The Beitang Water Plant is located near Beitang Reservoir, and takes in raw water from Beitang 

Reservoir as well Huanggang No. 1 Reservoir and Huanggang No. 2 Reservoir. Beitang Water Plant 

commenced operations in March 2006. The water treated by Beitang Water Plant complies with the 

standard of non-drinking water for urban residential and industrial uses (“城市污水再生利用、城市杂用

水水质标准”).  

 

The new Xinhe plant under development is located in the Industry Development Zone for Tianjin Binhai 

Hi-tech and New-tech, and is designed to treat the water from a third-party-owned treatment plant that 

discharges industrial water to the standard of Tianjin Municipal Standard Class One A, which is suitable 

for discharge into the natural environment. In future, the discharged water will be further treated to meet 

the standards for non-drinking water for urban residential and industrial uses, using UF+RO processing 

technology. The treated water is suitable for non-drinking household use, as well for watering plants 

and industrial uses. 

 

The Company’s network of pipelines covers the core area of Tianjin Binhai New District (天津滨海新区), 

which is located between Haifang Road in the East and Tangjin Expressway in the West. It covers 

Beitang Hi-tech Zone, Tanggu Ocean Hi-tech Zone, Dongxigu Area, Xiangluowan Business District, 

Lingang Economic Zone, Tianjin Port Bulk Cargo Logistic Centre, Central New Town North District, 

Tianjin Avenue area, South New Town. It will be further developed in accordance with the urban 

development plans of the service area, which is approximately 300 square kilometers in size. Since its 

establishment, the Company through its water treatment services has contributed greatly to the 

development of Tianjin Binhai New District (天津滨海新区).

Xinhe Water Plant Expansion 

 

At the end of December 2017, the Xinhe Water Plant had established a temporary facility to treat 

discharged water from a third party sewage treatment plant. This extra treatment is necessary to 

enable the discharged water to meet the newly implemented local standards before discharge. During 

2018, the Xinhe Water Plant was under construction when completed in 2019, it will expand into a fully 

operational facility to treat discharged water. 

 

Beitang Water Plant 

 

During 2018, the Beitang Water Plant has started to take water from the Huanggang No.2 Reservior as 

the Beitang Reservior had been reclassified by the government as water resources protection zone.  

 

2. Current Operations 

By the end 2018, Beitang Water Plant has reached annual production capacity of 100,000 cubic meters 

(m3) daily. The Xinhe Water Plant has achieved a trial operational capacity of 70,000 m3 daily. During 

the year, the network of pipelines increased by 44 kilometers, to reach a total network size of 376 

kilometers, serving 476 corporate customers. 

 

The total area of plants and greenery watered by the water from our network has increased by 1.66 

million square meters to reach 22.55 million square meters. Water used for watering plants and 

greenery was about 2.34 million m3, accounting for 16.38% of total water supplied by the Company. 

 

In 2018, the total number of residential customers serviced by the Company increased by 18,537 to 

about 920,000 homes. Residential consumption reached 1.23 million m3 of water, accounting for 8.66% 

of total water supplied, while commercial and office use was 406.3 thousand m3, and accounting for 

2.84% of total water supplied. 

 

In 2018, five more industrial customers came on board, bringing total industrial customers to 16. Water 

supplied to industrial users amounted to 10.30 million m3, accounting for 72.12%, an increase of 4.3%

3. Energy and Chemical Consumption 

The Company continually strives to increase efficiency in its consumption of energy and chemicals. 

 

In 2017, the Company upgraded the automation for plant operations, improved safety and efficiency 

measures for operations, and implemented the remote monitoring of the plant operation and the 

distribution network on a 24/7 basis through centralized video links. This has resulted in higher 

efficiency and reduced costs. 

 

The Company also improved the sanitation equipment to reduce chlorine use. This achievement has 

resulted in higher safety, lower maintenance requirements and better work conditions, thus ensuring 

smoother operations. 

 

The Company has established energy and chemical consumption levels as key performance targets for 

staff throughout the various processes of the operations. Monthly competitions are organized for work 

teams and extra incentive bonus is paid in accordance with the competition results at the end of year.

Target and Evaluation of Chemical Uses 

The uses of chemicals depend on the characteristics of raw materials to be processed, ie, raw water 

and discharged water, as well as the standard for the products of process. External factors which 

influence the uses of chemicals include seasonality, weather, source of raw water, quality of raw water 

as well as users’ requirements. 

 

The Company is in the process of setting targets for chemical consumption and the relevant evaluation 

mechanism. It is intended that industry technical consultants would be retained after Xinhe Water Plant 

is fully operational to conduct a review of the requirements.

Safety 

The Company has set up a safety operation system and put in place measures for enforcement. For 

pipeline network maintenance, the Company adopts regular patrols, together with a centralized video 

monitoring system. In the water plants, proper fences are set up around the water pools and life vessels 

placed inside the pools. There are warnings systems in the plants to highlight various risks. When 

entering work space, each work team must comprise at least two members walking together. Wearing 

of life jackets and reporting to central monitoring office in and out of work space are standard 

compulsory procedures. 

 

In the past three years, the Company has recorded no incidents which resulted death or injury to its 

workers. 

 

The Company has also established relevant model code for safe operations and protection measures. 

Stringent inspection rules have been set up for network monitoring and maintenance. For example, 

security surveillance camera system with alarms has been installed to cover all areas in our water 

plants. Our protection facilities include protection bars over precipitation pools advection pool, lifebuoys 

in designate places, water level alarm, alarm in chlorine room, and safety goggles. When working at 

precipitation pools, all staff are required to notify the central control room before entering the room and 

live monitoring is activated during the entire process from the central control room. Staff must work in 

pairs and wear safety jackets in that room. All new joiners must pass a swimming test and other safety 

tests. We have adopted a practicable emergency management plan. The Company emphasizes on 

strict compliance in model code for safety operations with adequate protection measure and regular 

maintenance and repair to our facilities to ensure safety. 

 

Our philosophy has always been “Safety Production” when it comes to production. We are active in 

adopting all relevant rules and guidelines from our supervisory bodies, especially the “Notice on 

Commencing Deep Safety Operation Inspection” set by the Water Authority and Safety Committee of 

Binhai New District. We have established a safety operation team and a network safety operation team 

respectively headed by our Vice General Manager and internal supervisory department. A rewards 

system has also been established.
