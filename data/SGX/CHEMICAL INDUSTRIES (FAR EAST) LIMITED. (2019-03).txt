To be able to supply basic and industrial 

chemicals to the region in a manner that is 

safe, sustainable and efficient. 

Since 1964, CIL has grown from supplying Chlorine to local waterworks to being the local 

supplier of choice for all the chemicals we produce. As the Singapore Exchange releases the 

“comply or explain“ sustainability framework, we are confident that the current systems will 

ensure our future sustainability.

About CIL

CIL continues to be the sole manufacturer of Chlorine, Sodium Hydroxide and 

other chlor-alkaline products in Singapore, as we have been since 1963. CIL was 

established as a pioneer industry to underpin the industrialization, and to-date 

remains the prime supplier of basic chemicals to the petro-chemical, pharmaceutical, 

electronics and water-treatment industries. In 1999, we erected a new chlor-alkali 

plant employing membrane technology on Singapore’s Jurong Island. 

Our HQ is located at No.3 Jalan Samulun Road, Singapore 629127. This location also 

acts as a back up storage and continuity site for the business. 





1

Chlorine is produced as the main product of our 

Chlor-alkali facilities. This is used mainly in basic 

chemical processes as well as in the semi-

conductor, industrial and Water treatment 

industries.

3

Hydrochloric Acid is one of two 

derivatives of Chlorine that is use for 

fertilizers, waste water treatment and other 

industrial processes.

We have, our main subsidiary, Chem  

Transport Pte Ltd to handle all logistics  

locally. 

Our main feedstock come from multiple 

sources with redundancies to ensure 

supply.

We have an in house lab to run tests on a 

daily basis to ensure quality and consistency.

We provide piping systems to big off takers 

on Jurong island for OSH &amp; environment 

reasons.

We use dedicated ISO tankers to bring our 

product to our customers.

Our principle of in house management 

ensure that our supply chain is unbroken.

2

Sodium Hydroxide commonly refered to as Caustic 

Soda is the main by product of Chlorine and is an 

openly sold commodity on the market. It is 

used by almost every plant on Jurong island 

in differing quantities but its use for PH 

balancing is almost universal.

4

Sodium Hypochlorite or more commonly 

refered to as Bleach. This product is 

used by many as a water treatment solution 

without the hazardous effects of Chlorine  

 

  gas.

E2 Long Term Contracts

We implement self regulating formulas 

with a Cost structure of our production 

factors plus a fixed margin for profitability. 

This functions on a monthly, quarterly and 

annual basis for adjustment depending on 

customers. This allows Chemical Industries 

and its customers to share in cost reductions 

and price hikes together. Most of the indices 

we refer to are publicly available. 

CIL has numerous contracts with other manufacturers and mulitnational corporations. 

Our conservative and long term appproach to bussiness tends to favour long term 

contracts with customers that go over 5 years. Of course pricing structures and cost 

structures tend to change over periods of time and we implement the following 

measures to mitigate the risk these contractual obligations bring with them.

Self regulating formulas

Such formulas promote transparency between customer and client. Verifi cation

of such information is generally done through the use of Public Indices 

available to both parties or provided by one for verifcation. In certain situations,

Customers have agreed to alter the structure of the formula with valid

basis  given. These adjustments and  are also available at pre determined

intervals in a contract.                                                 .

Transparency

While these formulas off er very competitive rates for product, they generally ensure 

a fi xed quantity of demands with a take or pay clause. This ensure a “base“ load for 

our production facilities. They also often include an exclusivity clause which ensures 

us being the sole supplier of the products we do supply.

E3 Employee Benefits

CIL has this year agreed to a collective 

agreement(CA) that will raise the transport 

allowance for staff as we see a higher base 

cost of transportation. The previous CA  had 

made a differentiation between employees 

who had addresses in Jurong and those 

outside of it. We have scrapped this for a 

single tier system with an across the board 

increase of transportation allowance.

CIL has always beleived that our staff and their committment is the backbone of our 

company. To reward our staff, CIL is proud to initiate a employee incentive plan that 

rewards workers both for their own KPIs and also based on the profits of the company 

each year. These two components are set before the financial year and both make up 

equal parts of an employees variable bonus

Transport allowances

•  We are currently experimenting with a KPI system that has been agreed to by heads 

of departments. These KPIs are department based and all members will then work 

towards common goals.

• The company performance element will be at management’s discretion on an 

annual basis and will ensure that Shareholders as well as employees share in the 

company’s success

•This system is not fi nalised and will be thoroughly tested.                                               .

Clear KPIs and goals

While these benefi ts do raise costs for our manpower, CIL has found that our 

remuneration is still below market standards averages in some areas. We will fi ne 

tune the incentives on an annual basis and set benchmarks according to the needs 

of the company. We currently believe the set KPIs will promote ownership of projects 

are benefi t the company’s assets as a whole.

S1 Occupational Safety and Health

•  CIL takes a very strong view to ensure workplace and saefty standards are 

complied with. We also have a zero tolerance policy on safety lapses. We wants 

our employees to work in a safe environment and be secure in the knowledge that 

we take their health and safety seriously.

S2 Customer Satisfaction Survey

•   The loyalty of customers in Singapore should not be taken for granted. The 

ease with which foreign competitors can enter the market with Singapore’s  

free trade status should not be under estimated. We thus hold ourselves to the 

high standards where customer feedback is concerned.

Our Feedback targets

•  Our targets for Feedback and complaints are as follows.

•  Number of complaints and feedback given must be less than 24 per year.

•  Complaints must be replied and resolved within 1 month of recieving them.

•  We aim for a number of compliments at least two times of the complaints  

recieved in the same period.

Env1 Energy Consumption

•  With the core process of chlorine manufacturing called Electrolysis, we use 

a lot of energy in production. This used to be much higher when Plastic 

producers were still situated in Singapore. With our dedication to lowering 

our Energy consumption, CIL is proud to use advanced technology that uses 

less electricity than most other producers of Chlorine. For competitve  reasons 

we are unable to share the information of our electricity  consumption or costs.

Preventive actions taken

•  Policy to replace fusible plugs every 5 yearly during the testing cycle 

•  A more structured training module with assessment was devised 

• Physical checks are now mandatory and signed off by supervisors 

•  To have physical samples/ photographs of rejected accessories 

•  QEWI have ben translated so all staff are able to understand them 

•  QEWI has been revised to include pictures and illustrations to further enhance 

checking procedures

• There was a chlorine leak from a cylinder on 4th September 2016. This leak was 

caused by a faulty fusible plug. The SCDF attended to the scene and the leak was 

contained. Two SCDF responders and five members of the public outside the work-

place were admitted for treatment and were discharged the same day.

Env2 Significant Spill

The Leak was identified to be due to dezincification of the fusible plug base material.
