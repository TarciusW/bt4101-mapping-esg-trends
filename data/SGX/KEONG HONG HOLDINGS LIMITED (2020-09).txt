CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE 

OFFICER’S MESSAGE

Dear Stakeholders,

We are pleased to present our Sustainability Report for FY2020, our third since the sustainability reporting initiative 

was introduced. The report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards 

(Core option), the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (SGX-ST) Listing Rules (711A and 711B) and SGX-ST 

guidelines on sustainability reporting.

COVID-19 PANDEMIC – PUTTING TO TEST OUR SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES

If there is one thing the past year has taught governments, businesses and individuals is the fact that maintaining the 

ecological balance is vital for our planet’s survival. While the actual cause of the corona virus has yet to be determined, 

environmentalists and scientists have pointed to the increasing incidence of pathogens crossing from animals to humans 

due to the disruption of ecosystems as human activity has often resulted in destruction of natural biodiversity. Whatever 

the case may be, the world is now paying the price of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our operations, as with almost every 

business globally, have been impacted by the pandemic, as highlighted in our Annual Report 2020. Fortunately for 

Keong Hong Holdings Limited (“Keong Hong” or “the Group”), we already had a robust system of safety measures and 

protocols in place for our operations, as workplace safety and health has always been a priority for us. While it was 

not an easy task, we managed to ramp these up to meet the stringent safe distancing and other workplace measures 

imposed by the Ministry of Health (“MOH”), Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”), the Building Construction Authority 

(“BCA”) and other authorities, especially the Covid-Safe Restart Criteria, which mandates a safe workforce, worksite, 

accommodation and transportation. A safe management measures committee has been set up, with Safe Management 

and Safe Distancing Officers appointed to ensure strict compliance with BCA and MOM regulations, including ensuring 

the availability of all necessary personal protection and medical equipment.

We have taken similar measures in our operations in Maldives, to protect the health and wellbeing of our airport staff 

and passengers at Kooddoo Airport as well as hotel guests and staff at our two hotel properties, Mercure Maldives 

Kooddoo Hotel and Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort in accordance with local Covid-19 laws and regulations. 

Additionally, our hotel and resort operator, Accor, has developed the Allsafe program, which is built around core pillars 

for the prevention of Covid-19, such as social distancing, disinfecting, personal hygiene and mandatory wearing of 

face masks in certain areas.

COMMITMENT TO CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE OUR SUSTAINABILITY PRACTICES AND 

TARGETS

Covid-19 prevention measures aside, we have maintained our efforts at ensuring ongoing sustainable practices. 

Technology continues to play a vital role in improving efficiencies, minimising waste and enhancing performance. We 

have upgraded our digital capabilities with the aim of ultimately digitalising most of our operations. We have also 

enhanced our Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (“DfMA”) technologies capacity with the completion of our 

factory extension and alterations which allows us to increase our Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction 

(“PPVC”) and Prefabricated Bathroom Unit (“PBU”) outputs.

We have met our sustainability targets for water and energy consumption, effluents and emissions production and use 

of recycled and green materials in our projects. Our efforts at embracing green practices have been recognised through 

the conferment of the BCA Green and Gracious Builder Award (Excellent) in 2020. We also continued to preserve the 

natural habitat and biodiversity of the environment, especially in our operations in the Maldives, where tremendous 

resources and effort have gone into our coral conservation programme.

CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE 

OFFICER’S MESSAGE

As a fair and inclusive employer and a responsible corporate citizen, our people and the community are also top-of-

mind in our sustainability endeavours. We continued to provide training, re-skilling and upskilling and health and 

wellness initiatives for our staff and workers. We remained committed to providing opportunities for local suppliers and 

businesses where possible, and to supporting community and charitable initiatives particularly in the area of education.

As with previous years, our sustainability efforts would not have been possible without the collaboration of our 

stakeholders, especially our business partners and suppliers. With our resilient mindset, unceasing efforts and purposeful 

goals, 2021 will surely be brighter and better.

KEONG HONG’S

SUSTAINABILITY STORY

Our Mission

To be a forward-looking company with a commitment to corporate social responsibility, built on a strong foundation 

of transparency, governance and ethics that creates value for our stakeholders.

Our Vision

To build a better world in an environmentally sustainable way and to improve the quality of the environment and the 

communities where we live and work.

Sustainability Philosophy

The Group has established a good reputation in the building and construction and hotel management industries in 

Singapore and Maldives. The Group has leveraged on expansion opportunities, achieved new revenue streams and 

unlocked new capabilities and possibilities while at the same time keeping in mind our sustainability targets. Keong 

Hong has also been lauded for adopting highly innovative solutions to our construction projects to reduce wastage, 

increase efficiency and productivity.

Since December 2019, the outbreak of Covid has posed unprecedented challenges to the world. We faced health and 

safety risks arising from the pandemic this year. However, the Group remains highly vigilant to the potential impact on 

employees and workers and has taken effective occupational health and safety measures to protect their welfare. We 

have also implemented robust safety measures, such as strict safety guidelines, safety distancing, Thermal Temperature 

checks and wearing of masks at local projects and the Kooddoo Airport, Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Hotel and Pullman 

Maldives Maamutaa Resort in Maldives to ensure the health and safety of our guests and employees.

In addition, the Group is committed to prevent pollution and injury in all its construction operations and to provide 

customers with reliable, prompt and quality service at competitive cost. We are committed to provide quality products 

and services to meet customer requirements through the timely delivery of projects complying with applicable legal and 

other requirements, quality workmanship, good safety standard and minimising impact to the environment.

Keong Hong is conscious of the impact that our projects have on the environment and shall continue monitoring and 

measuring these impacts. The Group will uphold our energy saving standards and invest in technologies to improve 

waste management and reduce emissions and effluents.

The Group will continue to ensure that our employees have a high standard of employee benefits and that there is 

both racial and gender diversity in our workforce to provide unique perspectives on issues that the Group faces. The 

Group will continue supporting charitable organisations to improve the welfare of the community.

Sustainability Targets

Keong Hong strives to set a high standard of sustainable business operations in both Singapore and Maldives by investing 

in more new technologies, constantly seeking improvements and continuing strict compliance to our standards in daily 

operations.

We endeavour to provide an adequate occupational health and safety environment and continue stringent due diligence 

checks on our suppliers.

culture, we continue to reaffirm our management’s commitment to an accident-free work culture. This ensures that 

every employee inherently believes in our WSH values and continues to implement and improve on WSH practices.

REPORTING

PRACTICE

Keong Hong’s sustainability report has been produced in accordance with the GRI Standards “Core” option covering 

our Group’s performance from 1 October 2019 to 30 September 2020.

The GRI Standards represent global best practices for reporting on economic, environmental and social topics. The report 

also incorporates the primary components of report content as set out by the SGX’s “Comply or Explain” requirements 

on sustainability reporting under Listing Rule 711B. The Group has assessed that external assurance is not required 

as the Group is laying the foundations for a sustainability reporting framework this year. This report supplements the 

Group’s FY2020 Annual Report and is available online at: https://www.keonghong.com.

Developing Technology

GRI 203-1, 203-2

Our construction projects have brought about indirect economic benefits to the local community. Our construction 

projects require the expertise of direct/indirect suppliers and specialists – concrete, reinforcement, tiles/stone and 

furniture which generates business opportunities within and among the supply chain.

We have upgraded our digital capability in Building Information Modelling (BIM), Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) 

and Virtual Reality (VR). We are proud to be one of the pioneers in adopting the Digit-alpha capability transformation 

Programme, a pilot project with VR as a core module sponsored by Info-communications Media Development Authority 

(IMDA). With the Digit-alpha Programme, we hope to streamline our operations and transform our business processes 

to improve our workforce productivity and achieve business growth.

We have also adopted Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA) technologies, including Prefabricated Prefinished 

Volumetric Construction (PPVC), Prefabricated Bathroom Unit (PBU) and Mechanical Electrical Plumbing (MEP) module 

which improve productivity at construction sites, as the manufacturing of these building components can be completed 

off-site in a safe and controlled environment. Notably, DFMA was used extensively in the National Skin Centre project, 

such as integrating horizontal MEP module at the passenger lift lobby, vertical MEP module at the air handling unit 

(AHU), as well as inter-connecting piping and combined services MEP in the risers.

Our new factory at 20 Chin Bee Drive that underwent major Additions and Alterations (A&amp;A) works is equipped with a 

45-ton double gantry crane with 14-meter clear lifting height and a 5-ton Jib Crane. It has enough capacity to produce 

PPVC for 10 dwelling units in 14 days or 130 PBUs in 10 days which works out to be 500 dwelling units of PPVC or 

4,680 PBUs in a year. The adoption of PPVC and PBU will help to significantly reduce our reliance on labour, speed up 

construction and minimize dust and noise pollution in our construction projects as more activities are done off-site.

In addition, high productivity software based on mobile and cloud technology have been used to enhance productivity 

on-site. For example, we used Novade Quality in the Seaside Residence project to manage the defect rectification process 

during quality inspections, handover and defect liability period for building projects. More of such high productivity 

software shall be utilised for our ongoing and future projects.

BIM 360 is another cloud-based software adopted by our company to connect project teams and data in real-time, 

flowing from design to construction. This technology supports informed decision-making and leads to more efficient 

and effective work processes.

Keong Hong will continue to innovate and implement new technologies in our operations to benefit our business, our 

industry and the community.

shifting. In addition, the funds are used for salary/wages, meals, transport, medical check-up, surviving working capital 

and site expenses during the Circuit Breaker and to mitigate the adverse impact of the lockdown on revenue generation.

Recycled Input Materials

GRI 301-2

The Group has undertaken methods to recycle input materials in our projects to reduce wastage and ensure sustainable 

operations.

At Keong Hong, we are committed to using eco-friendly and recycled materials in our construction projects wherever 

possible. We conscientiously use green concrete to replace Ordinary Portland Cement for the construction of permanent 

structures in our Amore and Seaside Residences projects, and 10% of the green concrete is used for superstructure 

works. Together with our use of green material, this translates into reduction in carbon footprint for the construction 

projects as the materials can be recycled. Notably, our Raffles Hospital extension project received a Green Mark Platinum 

rating, which is a testament to our corporate commitment to green practices.

In addition, to minimise wastage, we implement predominantly aluminium system formwork which includes self-climbing 

formwork, vertical safety screen, table form, metal wall and slab formwork for all construction projects on-site, as 

aluminium can be reused with minimal wastage. We also use recycled construction materials like recycled timber and 

plywood for safety barricade, recycled steel hollow section for fabrication and recycled earth control measure tank and 

filtration systems to control water discharge drainage for temporary works.

We used green materials extensively in the National Skin Centre, with the concrete used comprising 36% green concrete 

and 0.04% green cement. National Skin Centre has received a Green Mark Platinum rating.

Keong Hong is committed to the preservation of the environment by championing Green and Gracious practices to 

reduce energy and water consumption as well as carbon dioxide emissions. We have received the Green and Gracious 

Excellence Award from BCA in recognition of our efforts.

The Group endeavours to draw energy from renewable sources rather than non-renewable sources. This is to preserve 

the environment and meet compliance standards. The Group taps on solar energy to power noise meters and traffic 

warning signs. In addition, the Group uses green label appliances and energy efficient light fittings to reduce energy 

consumption and emissions.

The Group is committed to achieving our planned objectives and targets to ensure that we are operating sustainably. 

We strive to reduce energy consumption for all building and construction projects. See below for charts for energy

We engage Qualified Erosion Control Professional (QECP) to design our Earth Control Measures (ECM) filtration and 

sediment control system such that part of the effluents discharge is reused for wash bay. This is an efficient way to 

conserve water as washing large volume of vehicles could mean high water consumption. Rainwater that is stored in 

the sump of the tank is also reused for the washing of vehicles entering or leaving the site. This allows us to conserve 

water used for washing of vehicles at our construction sites. We endeavour to implement more water conservation 

measures to further reduce water consumption on-site.

Effluents and Waste Management

GRI 306-1, 306-2, 306-5

Keong Hong endeavours to manage waste sustainably by implementing technologies and complying with the code of 

practice.

We minimise construction waste by harnessing advanced technology, including BIM, VDC and VR. These technologies 

pre-empt costly abortive works by first identifying clashes in a virtual environment before the project is actually built. 

High standard of workmanship and quality of works are also achieved through implementation of DfMA technology like 

PPVC and PBU by shifting work to a sheltered and controlled environment. Wherever feasible, construction materials 

used for our projects are Green Label certified from the Singapore Environmental Council. The Group implements on-

site recycling policies to segregate different types of waste materials so they can be efficiently handled for disposal. 

Surface run-off water is treated before it is discharged to public drains.

Keong Hong is responsible in the disposal of its waste materials by using only approved methods to minimise any harm 

to the environment. Excess debris and general waste from construction are collected in designated bins for proper 

disposal by licensed disposal contractors. All left over scrap metal from reinforcement bar are segregated and disposed 

by licensed waste collectors. Timbers that are not reusable are periodically disposed of by a licensed contractor engaged 

by our appointed Environment Control Officer.

Noise and Vector Management

GRI 413-1

The Group strives to manage noise arising from construction activities by using a set of permissible noise limits and 

Noise Management Plans (NMP) compliant with National Environment Agency (NEA) Noise Regulation. To achieve 

minimization of noise, the Group has engaged a noise control vendor to perform real time noise monitoring to ensure 

that the noise generated does not exceed the NEA permissible noise levels. Noise barriers are erected around the site 

to reduce noise from the construction equipment. Generators used on site are required to be ‘silent’ generators, so 

that noise generated is reduced.

The Group implements vector control plans at our sites to combat the issue of pest and mosquito breeding. Daily on-

site housekeeping checks are conducted to control and pre-empt mosquito breeding. To further mitigate mosquito 

breeding, the Group engages pest control companies to manage our construction sites to clamp down on mosquito 

breeding. Allocation and implementation of proper disposal systems for construction debris and organic waste are in 

place to facilitate pest control.

Managing our Suppliers

GRI 308-1, 308-2, 414-1, 414-2

At Keong Hong, we take pride in our efforts to ensure that our suppliers and subcontractors are selected based on high 

quality and environmentally friendly practices. Before awarding contracts, we evaluate our suppliers and subcontractors 

based on their track record, workmanship, ISO certifications, safety performance as well as Green and Gracious practices. 

We select those with satisfactory scores, and for some who are relatively new and failed the supplier assessment, we 

will monitor their site performance to ensure accountability and quality assurance.

During contract term, we continue to assess suppliers based on their compliance with material specification/standards, 

response to replacement of defective material/emergency and their Green and Gracious practices. As for subcontractors, 

we assess their technical capability, safe performance and Green and Gracious practices. These continuous assessments 

show our commitment to maintain quality and sustainability of our operations.

In addition, we also assess subcontractors and external service providers who procure materials and services for 

our contracts and project activities. We execute purchase control to ensure that they meet the needs of our project 

requirements during procurement. We go the extra mile in supplier management to ensure quality, accountability and 

sustainability in our supply chain.

We exercise stringent control at site level via biometric system to ensure that only valid work permit holders can gain 

entry to the project site. Regular checks are conducted by our HR executive to ensure that only workers with current 

worksite resident address are allowed to stay on-site. We mandate that our contractors and sub-constructors comply 

with labour regulations in Singapore.

Environmental Compliance

GRI 307-1

The Group’s compliance polices and regulations take into consideration data collected on Energy, Water, and Waste 

Disposal. This data is analysed for the various projects for project cost optimisation and resources.

Keong Hong has committed to a set of guidelines to manage environmental pollution at all our project sites. We are 

committed to controlling the combined cost of water, electricity, diesel consumption and generator rental to less than 

0.8% of contract sum per project, as well as keeping waste disposal cost to less than 0.3% of contract sum per project.

There were zero incidents of non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations in FY2020.

To ensure proper management of sludge and effluents, the Group has constructed a sewer network grid over the 

island with a gravity flow system, as opposed to the conventional pump system used in previous projects which was 

less energy-efficient.

Division of waste type generated at our Kooddoo Airport, Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Hotel and Pullman Maldives 

Maamutaa Resort are completed at the waste management building which is equipped with incinerators, compactors 

and bottle crushers. We ensure that proper transportation and waste disposal methods are used in accordance to the 

type of waste.

Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Hotel and Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort

At Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Hotel, sewage is disposed via a computerised chemical digestive system whereby sewage 

is pumped via a 150,000 litre capacity sewage treatment plant to process it into sludge. On the other hand, sewage 

at Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort is disposed via Membrane Bioreactor system whereby sewage is pumped via a 

300,000 litre capacity sewage treatment plant to process it into sludge. Once the sludge is dried, it is sent to a nearby 

waste management centre and used for landfill. This system is established for both Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Hotel 

and Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort, and complies with local standards and accepted code of practices.

We take care in wastewater disposal to ensure that we do not harm the environment during operations. At our 

properties, rejected brine from our RO plants are instantly mixed with the water column to reduce its concentration 

to negligible amounts before being discharged into the lagoon, thus this discharge has no effect on the surrounding 

environment. Sewerage is also recycled into portable water to be stored for irrigation usage, and only excess sewerage 

is discharged into the sea.

In our effort to minimise plastic wastage, we own water bottling facilities at both Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Hotel 

and Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort which effectively cleans glass bottles and fills the bottles up with clean filtered 

potable water. These glass bottles of water have replaced plastic bottles in the rooms, thereby reducing plastic waste 

generated.

Both Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Hotel and Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort are equipped with its own organic 

waste composting machine that processes daily food waste ingredients into organic fertilisers. By applying only organic 

compost, it improves the overall soil structure.

We have also reached out to local residents and companies to recycle used cooking and generator oil. Our organisation 

is consistently looking for new options to help improve environmental sustainability.

In FY2020, the average daily waste generation at Kooddoo Airport was 150 kg, which remains at the same level 

compared to last year.

Managing Biodiversity

GRI 304-2, 304-3

Keong Hong endeavours to protect and preserve the environment during our operations, by putting initiatives in place 

to ensure we operate sustainably.

The Group has engaged specialists to preserve the vibrant biodiversity of the environment in Maldives. Before excavation 

and construction commence, our specialists will transplant corals from all project sites to safe areas. The Group has 

plans to set up a coral conservation programme at the resort which includes a coral garden and coral nursery to preserve 

the coral reef. We endeavour to maintain the good condition of the coral colonies in the vicinity of our operations. 

Planting of corals under the rooms will only commence after all construction activities are completed to prevent any 

unnecessary coral stress and bleaching.

Due to the high volume of marine recreation activities at Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort, the Group has undertaken 

several initiatives to manage environmental impacts for all operations in Maldives. To circumvent any damage to the 

coral reef through the use of boats and marine equipment, the Group has imposed rules on boat operators on the 

island such as anchoring, boat operation, boat sewage and garbage disposal. For tourists engaging in recreational 

activities, strict rules on activities such as fishing, marine wildlife viewing, snorkelling, diving and scuba, have been 

established and enforced.

In an effort to ensure that our environmental protection efforts are regulated and implemented properly, we went the 

extra mile to perform Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) on the Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort project, and we 

successfully attained EIA approval in 2015. The EIA addendum was submitted and approved prior to the commencement 

of coral gardening works and revision of Concept Masterplan for both Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Hotel and Pullman 

Maldives Maamutaa Resort. As such, proper precautionary measures have been implemented to guarantee environmental 

and biodiversity sustainability during operations.

In FY2020, we transplanted corals from our coral nursery to the Ocean Water Villa and Underwater villa to showcase 

our coral nursery to the guests from the comfort of their rooms. Marine life, including lionfish, octopus and boxfish 

were added for biodiversity.

Our Island Marine Biologist regularly assesses the condition and growth of the coral colonies under the Ocean Villa’s 

viewing panel and the coral garden, and coral predators are removed once spotted. The coral garden in front of the two 

Ocean Villas were observed to be under stress due to the rising temperature at the beginning of 2020. In the recent 

survey conducted in July 2020, the coral garden was found to be recovering beyond expectations and growing at an 

unprecedented pace, and the overall quantity of fishes has also increased. The recovery is mostly due to the monsoon 

rain and wind that lowered the water temperature by 1-2 degree Celsius.

In addition to coral nurseries, we built an organic farm at both properties to minimise negative impacts on the 

surrounding environment. Our organic farm at Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort, Phat Chameleon Garden, measures 

at an estimated area of 900 sqm and it is loaded with exotic and delicious variety of tropical fruits and vegetables. The 

farm offers many fruits trees like Persea Americana (Avocado), Manikara zapota (Chiku), Averrhoa carambola (Star Fruit) 

and Annona muricata (Soursop). Organic farming is an agricultural system that adopts ecologically based pest controls 

and biological fertilisers derived mainly from animal and plant wastes. It reduces negative environmental impacts caused 

by the use of chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilisers in conventional agriculture, and it has numerous ecological 

benefits.

GRI 308-1, 308-2, 408-1, 409-1, 414-1, 414-2

Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Hotel and Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort

When selecting suppliers, we entrust the recommendations from our internationally renowned hotel operator, AccorHotel 

(Accor), with their abundance of experience in the Maldives region. We evaluate and select suppliers that are approved 

and recommended by our hotel operator.

The suppliers have gone through stringent checks to ensure that they are in compliance with local regulations and 

sourcing of raw materials are done ethically and in an environmentally friendly manner. We also regularly review the 

supplies procured to ensure that sustainable products are used. For instance, at Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort, 

the procured bed sheets, duvet and pillow covers are eco-friendly textile products certified according to Oeko-Tex 

Standard 100 technology. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 is a globally uniform testing and certification system for textile 

products which covers multiple human-ecological attributes, and textile products may be certified according to Oeko-

Tex Standard 100 only if all components strictly meet the required ecological criteria without exception. This shows 

our commitment to ensure a sustainable supply chain.

We have plans to start screening suppliers ourselves instead of through our hotel operator for future jobs to ensure 

quality, accountability and social responsibility within our supply chain.

In addition, Accor ensures strict compliance with the local legal framework, as well as various fundamental documents 

including International Labour Organisation’s fundamental conventions and the ten principles of the United Nations 

Global Compact. As such, Accor exercises strict due diligence when assessing their suppliers and service providers to 

ensure they are not at risk for incidents of child labour or forced or compulsory labour. In the event of non-compliance 

with local labour laws, Accor would immediately sever all ties with the supplier or service provider in question.

We entrust Accor with the hotel supplier management as they have expertise in that area. Majority of our suppliers are 

approved and recommended by our hotel operator. The suppliers have gone through stringent checks to ensure there 

is no child or prisoner labour. We have plans to start screening suppliers ourselves for future jobs to ensure quality 

and accountability.

In FY2020, the Covid-19 outbreak resulted in a global pandemic which posed as a serious threat to our staff and 

workers. During these unsettling times, we stay committed to prioritising their safety and providing them with a safe 

working environment. We have set up a safe management measures (SMM) committee which includes Safe Management 

Officers (SMO) and Safe Distancing Officers (SDO) to ensure that we strictly comply with the Ministry of Manpower 

(MOM) regulations regarding Covid-19. The SMO and SDO will monitor the health conditions of all staff and workers 

on a daily basis and ensure that PPE and medical equipment (e.g. thermometers, disposable gloves, surgical masks and 

hand sanitisers) are adequately prepared.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH

AND SAFETY

With the current Covid-19 pandemic, we have conducted a comprehensive safety risk assessment and briefed all 

employees on the SMM to ensure strict enforcement. Targeting the risk areas, we have implemented SMM which meet 

the Covid-Safe Restart Criteria under BCA, namely to ensure a safe workforce, safe worksite and safe accommodation 

and transportation. Some of the SMM include safety distancing, biweekly testing of workers for Covid-19, segregation 

of workers of different projects to minimise transmission risks, segregation of dormitories into zones to enforce 

segregation of workforce on site, biometric scanning and temperature monitoring using temperature screening face 

recognition systems. In addition, the SMO and SDO will assist and supervise workers to ensure that all workers comply 

with safety distancing measures and any other preventive actions advised by the Authorities. We keep abreast with the 

latest health advisories issued BCA, Ministry of Health (MOH), MOM and other government agencies as the situation 

evolves and take precautions to protect our staff, workers and visitors. We have evacuation procedures in place to 

facilitate employees’ access to the nearest hospital and Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC) in case of suspect 

Covid-19 cases and emergencies.

As at 30 September 2020, we had 205 foreign workers under our care. In FY2020, there were 2 direct incidents of 

Covid-19 transmission among foreign workers. We took the immediate conservative approach of stepping up the 

quarantine for the rest of the workers who are either in close proximity or using the same common areas as the 2 

positive cases, at separate government facilities. This resulted in approximately 95 workers being quarantined and having 

1,330 man-days lost. However, our aggressive approach in stemming the Covid-19 transmission resulted in subsequent 

zero further cross infections among the rest of the workers and we were able to proceed on with our project works, 

after the 2-week quarantine hiatus. In addition, there was no reported incident of non-compliance with local Covid-19 

laws and regulations regarding the living and working conditions of our foreign workers.

Vision towards an Accident-free Work Culture

GRI 403-1, 403-4, 403-5, 403-9

We have a Health and Safety Committee with joint management-worker representation to facilitate a positive health 

and safety culture. It is the responsibility of our workers that they observe all safety precautions and comply with our 

Safety Rules and Regulations. We implement strict safety policies on-site by mandating trainings such as Safety Induction 

Training and Safe Work Practices Demonstration for all workers before they are allowed to commence work on-site to 

help us achieve our goal of an accident-free work culture.

We believe that positive safety culture starts from the top. We have implemented the Construction Safety Audit Scoring 

System (ConSASS) to audit the Safety and Health Management System at our Group and worksites. We have developed 

the CultureSAFE programme to help us build a positive Workplace Safety and Health culture, mind-set and attitude 

beyond infrastructure and level of competency.

We organise a bi-annual Safety Award day for all personnel to celebrate safety milestones and reward individuals who 

demonstrate exemplary workplace safety behaviour and contribute to project safety. We also recite the safety pledge 

and conduct safety quizzes during the ceremony to promote safety awareness and inculcate safety knowledge among 

workers. The ceremony serves to encourage all staff and workers to continue working towards achieving our workplace 

health and safety targets and prioritising safety.

Keong Hong actively participated in the sharing of safety experiences gained from projects with the construction 

community. We were invited by Ministry of Health Holding to share our experience of utilising innovation and technology 

to enhance site safety at their Healthcare Infrastructure Projects Division (HIPD) Annual Workplace Safety and Health 

Officers Dialogue 2019.

the entrance of the worksite. Together, we pledge to promote safety and strive for zero accident at our project sites.

Injuries and Incidents

GRI 403-2, 403-

In FY2020, our Workplace Fatal Injury Rate is 0 and Major Injury Rate is 0.35, both well below the industrial average1 

of 2.9 and 26.62 respectively. Our safety performance in FY2020 is in line with our aim of meeting the following 

Occupational Health and Safety Objectives:

• 

Maintain formal certification of our ISO 45001:2018 safety management system and BizSafe Star

• 

Zero fatality

• 

Zero Stop Work Order

• 

Zero MOM demerit points

• 

Strive for zero reportable accident

• 

Reduce Workplace Fatal Injury Rate to below Industrial Standard (2.9) per project per year

• 

Reduce Major Injury Rate to below Industrial Standard (26.6) per project per year

To lower the risk of incidents and diseases, high-risk areas namely water bodies and food waste that attract pests such 

as mosquitos, flies and rodents were identified. Thereafter, we implemented corresponding preventive measures, such 

as constructing surface and subsoil drainage to control mosquito breeding at water bodies, and engaging NEA-approved 

licensed contractors to dispose food wastes and preventing food from rotting at our worksites.

FY2020, the Group has donated over S$31,000 to various charitable organisations and beneficiaries which include the 

Singapore Contractors Association Ltd (SCAL) Covid-19 fund launched by SCAL to help the construction sector tide 

through Covid-19. The Fund aims to provide eligible companies with relief to ease their financial difficulties, particularly 

during this Circuit Breaker period where companies continue to incur operation costs, and expenses associated with 

taking care of their foreign employees placed under Stay-Home Notice (SHN).

We also made donations to other charitable and social causes such as Singapore Association for Mental Health and The 

Singapore Scout Association. The Group places emphasis on dedicating resources towards the development of local 

communities and future leaders by investing in educational institutes and bursaries.

The Group has also been channelling a significant part of our efforts and resources into developing the talent pool for 

our industry. In FY2020, the Group has donated over $1,156 to bursaries and educational institutes. We have awarded 

scholarships and bursaries to deserving recipients for their pursuit of tertiary education.

More recently, we have worked closely with United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to achieve global 

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to create sustainable localised solutions to the population. We have received 

several appreciation letters commending our efforts and commitment to the UNDP. Both resorts in Maldives have 

achieved platinum status in Planet 21, Accor’s sustainable green platform.
