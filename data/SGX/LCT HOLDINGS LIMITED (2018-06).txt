About LCT  

Formally known as Longcheer Holdings Limited, the Group’s history can be traced back to 2002. 

Pursuant to the Group’s announcement dated 10 October 2016, the Group officially changed its 

name from “Longcheer Holdings Limited” to “LCT Holdings Limited” (hereby known as “LCT”, “the 

Group”, “We” or “Our”) due to a change in business structure. LCT is incorporated in Bermuda with 

its principal place of business at the People’s Republic of China, with our principal activity focused on 

property investment and management business.   

 

LCT engages in property investment and property management services.  LCT was successfully listed 

on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Mainboard on 13 May 2005.

loss of RMB 6.2 million in the previous year.   

 

Our Vision and Mission Statement 

 

With the backdrop of China's grim economy and complexity of the international environment, the 

Shanghai composite index dropped nearly 29% in 2018. Leading to its ranking of the second lowest

Our Board and management will continue to be vigilant in overseeing the prudent and efficient 

management of our operations. We will also continue to seek opportunities to create long term 

shareholder value, which includes evaluating strategic opportunities that fit with our long-term 

vision. 

 

LCT has laid a good foundation after numerous restructuring and improvements made. With rapid 

transformation in businesses in China and globally, this is an opportune time, and we look forward to 

working with our fellow colleagues to seek opportunities arising from China’s economic 

transformation to ensure sound asset quality as well as strong and sustainable profitability. 

 

Our Most Valuable Asset – Our People

Governance at LCT 

 

The Group believes that governance establishes the tone for the organisation, ensuring 

accountability, transparency, ethical business conduct and maximisation of long term shareholder 

value. The Board and the management are wholly dedicated to uphold the highest standard of 

corporate governance, professional business conduct, integrity and commitment throughout the 

organisation.   

 

The Group adheres to the principles and guidelines of the Code of Corporate Governance 2012 (the 

“Code”) issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (the “MAS”), which forms the continuing 

obligations of the listing manual of SGX-ST. The Board also ensures that the Group observe other 

regulations, notices, circulars, and guidelines that may be released by the MAS and the SGX-ST from 

time to time and should there be deviations, explanations will be provided. 

 

The Board oversees the governance of risk and is fully aware of the need to put in place a sound 

system of risk management and internal controls to safeguard the shareholders’ interests and the 

Group’s assets. Internal monitoring and review processes have been established to assess the 

adequacy and the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control systems put in place, including 

financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls and risk management 

systems. The Audit Committee (“AC”) reviews each transaction with the Group’s interested persons, 

ensuring that each transaction is executed at arm’s length basis and hence, not prejudicial to the 

interests of the Group and shareholders, before making its recommendation to the Board for 

approval. There were no interested person transactions in the year under review. 

 

Another act of good corporate governance is the implementation of whistle-blowing policy which 

presents an avenue to our people and any other persons to raise in confidence, their concerns about 

possible improprieties, fraudulent activities and malpractices within the Group in a responsible 

manner, regarding financial reporting or other matters.  

 

Sustainability at LCT 

 

The Group’s strategy formulation incorporated sustainability topics. Our management team leads 

our sustainability efforts, and ensures that the Group’s business objectives are in line with our 

commitments to sustainable development. The management ensures that our operations and 

processes are managed in a way that minimises its impact on our environment.  

 

The management team is responsible for continual communication of our sustainability performance 

to the Board, who oversees the leadership role for the Group’s sustainability strategy.  LCT have 

taken efforts to actively engage our stakeholders, to understand their perspective on our sustainable 

practices, either in an informal or formal manner. Through the engagement, key ESG topics are 

identified and included within this report. LCT aspire to understand and meet the needs and 

expectation of our key stakeholders, and strive to build mutual beneficial relationships.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

LCT is dedicated to deliver long term economic value to our stakeholders, through sound financial 

stewardship and maintaining a suitable business portfolio. 

 

In the year under review, LCT is delighted to announce a 4% increase in revenue, despite the 

backdrop of a slow economic growth, interest rate pressure and a weakening stock market in China. 

The increase in revenue is attributable to the Xi’an investment property, which was leased to our 

business partners in the science and education industries, thereby achieving higher average rental 

rate upon lease renewals.   

 

As we move along in this wavering economy, which brings about pressure to the local rental market, 

the management is committed in exploring various leasing methods and new forms of operation, in 

order to sustain the development of our Group’s operations. 

 

The Board and the management will continue to exercise prudence and efficient management of 

LCT’s business operations. We seek to leverage on China’s economic transformation which brings 

about business opportunities that are in line with our long-term business vision, to embark on future 

projects and sustain our economic growth in the coming years.

ANTI-CORRUPTION 

 

At LCT, we have zero tolerance for corruption. The Code of Conduct encompasses the most 

imperative corporate principles and behavioural rules. It is further supplemented by guidelines for 

dealing with potential conflicts of interest. These guidelines are the drivers of our preventive 

measures against corruption. 

 

LCT has put in place a whistle blowing policy duly endorsed by the Audit Committee (“AC”) and 

approved by the Board. The policy allows employees of the Group, in good faith and in confidence, 

raise concerns about actual or possible corporate improprieties in matters of financial reporting or 

other matters. The AC members will be informed directly for any matters arising from the 

aforementioned. The AC members may, in consultation with the Managing Director and/or 

management, direct the complaint to the division or department best placed to address it, or lead 

the investigation to ensure prompt and appropriate investigation and resolution. This policy also 

serves as a reassurance to whistle blowers that they are shielded from reprisals for whistleblowing in 

good faith. The details of the whistle-blowing policy and procedure have been made available to all 

employees and published in our website.  

 

Aside to the whistle blowing policy, a conflict of interest policy has also been implemented. The 

conflict of interest policy allows directors, management and employees to identify situations that 

present potential conflicts of interest, as well as setting out procedures to appropriately manage 

conflicts in accordance with LCT’s business objectives of transparency and accountability. 

 

At LCT, we strictly instil our values to our employees and ensure that our stand on corruption is clear. 

In addition to the Code of Conduct, we also uphold the Code of Ethics which accentuates the 

professional business conduct and behaviour that all employees should possess. All employees are 

expected to abide by the code and perform work in a responsible and professional manner. Internal 

audits are also performed annually, thereby identifying any short comings in our controls that may 

lead to inter-alias fraud, and report adverse findings. During the year under review, no whistle 

blowing report regarding the abovementioned concerns was received by the AC.  

 

Moving forward, LCT strives to maintain the zero record in corruption cases, and we will continue to 

nurture an anti-corruption environment.

ENERGY 

 

The world has seen the impact brought about by climate change, businesses have to perform their 

operations in a sustainable manner to reduce the potential impact their operations have on earth.  

 

LCT acknowledges the importance of proper management and regulation of our energy consumption 

so as to reduce our carbon footprint on the environment. The Group adopted green practices to 

reduce our energy consumption, those activities includes inter-alias switching off the lights at our 

workshops and offices during lunch time, using LED lights, using energy efficient equipment and 

setting our computers to energy-saving mode.  

 

FY2018 

KWh 

Electricity Consumption 

3,550,000.00 

 

Moving forward, we aim to achieve more efficient energy consumption through implementation of 

measures to effectively control and monitor our energy consumption. 

 

 

 

 

 



LCT HOLDINGS LIMITED| SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018    12 

 


EMPLOYMENT 

Our employees are the drivers for our success, 

they are LCT’s most valuable asset. We value 

our employees and uphold ourselves to fair 

employment practices for our workforce. 

Through that, we attract and retain the 

talented candidate, create a motivated 

workforce and grow the competency of our 

workforce.  

Employment Policy 

 

The Group has put in place an employment 

policy and management principles which 

comprise primary areas such as employee 

recruitment and selection, remuneration and 

employee benefits, performance appraisals, 

career 

development 

and 

cessation 

of 

employment. An employee handbook which 

contains the established policy is provided to 

all employees, and will be regularly reviewed 

by the management. In view of the Group’s 

endeavour in aligning our business objectives 

with 

our 

employee’s 

objectives, 

we 

continuously 

seek 

feedback 

from 

our 

employees and ensure that their needs and 

expectations are taken into consideration for 

our business. LCT adopts a performance-

based approach, and each employee is 

awarded 

according 

to 

the 

annual 

performance appraisal performed, they are 

also 

provided 

with 

impartial 

career 

advancement opportunities.  

All our employees are full time employees and 

hired from our local community. The Group 

provides our employees with the local 

government benefits, including maternity 

leave and parental leave. During the reporting 

period, there was no maternity or paternity 

leave taken. As at 30 June 2018, there were a 

total of six employees under the Group. There 

were four out of six female employees while 

the remaining were male employees. The 

Group is in the opinion that we have a 

proportionate mix of gender in our Group. In 

FY2018, three out of six employees were in 

the senior management and managerial level 

and above, while the remainder were in the 

non-managerial level.  During the review 

period, two new employees joined the Group, 

while three employees resigned during the 

same period. The Group is constantly trying to 

retain our employees through attractive 

compensation 

packages 

and 

career 

development.
