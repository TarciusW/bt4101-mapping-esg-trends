CEO'S MESSAGE
Dear Stakeholders,
We are pleased to present ST Group Food Industries Holdings Limited ("ST Group" or the

which provides information on the sustainability of our business and practices during the financial
year ended 30 June ("FY") 2020.
ST Group's mission is to provide high standards of service and high quality food products to our
customers at all the restaurants and kiosks under our portfolio of food and beverage ("F&B")
brands in a sustainable manner. We strive to achieve this sustainability objective through three (3)
key areas: prioritising the health and safety of our customers; having a strong commitment to the
environment; and recognising that our people are our assets.
High standards are applied across our food supply chain. We apply stringent selection criteria to
our initial supplier selection and continued supplier evaluation to ensure that our ingredients are
fresh and procured through environmentally and socially sustainable means. Best practices are
adopted in managing our food storage and preparation, and the Group's food safety
management systems have been certified to comply with the requirements of international
standards.
In pursuit of the Group's environmental goals, we strive to incorporate sustainable practices in our
operations by reducing energy usage, reducing wastage and reducing materials usage in our daily
operations.
We take great pride in ensuring that we provide high quality service to all customers. We are
committed to investing in our employees, equipping them with knowledge and skills to enable them
to serve our valued customers better.
The Group constantly gathers feedback from customers, suppliers, vendors, employees
shareholders, and regulators. We value the opinions of our stakeholders as we formulate plans for
the future.
We are committed to seeking sustainable ways to operate our business and will continue placing
emphasis on good sustainability practices.

and hygiene.
The wellbeing of our employees is our core priority. We have continuous development programs
and training for our employees to enhance their skillsets, ensuring that they are equipped with the
knowledge and skills to serve our customers better.

FOCUS 1: OUR CUSTOMERS
Food Health and Safety
GRI 414-1, 414-2, 416-1, 416-2
F&B Retail and Central Kitchen
ST Group, as a renowned and trustworthy food service provider, is committed to ensuring high
standards of food quality and safety. Achieving and maintaining high quality and safety standards
along our entire food value chain is at the core of our business practices. As such, the Group is
meticulous in the way we prepare food and judicious in our selection of suppliers.
Supplier Selection
The Group procures from approved suppliers who produce, package, store and deliver products
in accordance with good manufacturing practices prevailing in their respective industries.
Approved suppliers are expected to provide goods and services that consistently meet our required
specifications, in particular product quality and timeliness of product delivery.
Product quality and reliability of suppliers' services play a significant role in the quality and taste of
our food products. Factors such as the timeliness of delivery are essential factors for consideration
in our supplier selection process to ensure the freshness, quality, and safety of our food products
Other supplier assessment criteria include unit price, payment terms, rebates offered, and other
qualitative costs to ensure the economic viability of our food value chain. We prioritise the health
of our customers by using certified cooking oils from our panel of approved suppliers.
Food Storage and Delivery
The Group implements comprehensive food storage policies to keep our food products fresh and
wholesome. Our restaurants and central kitchen adopt a minimum inventory policy, and most of
the semi-finished food products are prepared and sent to our restaurants on a regular basis via
chilled delivery trucks to maximise the freshness of food products.
In addition, our ingredients are kept in chilled storage spaces and freezers that are clean and
hygienic with temperatures monitored regularly. Expiry dates on all the food and ingredient
packaging are always checked before use. These procedures are performed to ensure that only
the freshest ingredients are used to prepare our final products.
Food Preparation
We adopt stringent food hygiene practices and guidelines in the food preparation process. Food
handlers are trained and reminded constantly on the importance of personal hygiene and
cleanliness of their working environment. For example, food handlers are required to wear hair
coverings and gloves when handling and preparing food. The food manufacturing division and
areas such as food delivery vehicles and food storage areas are also inspected daily for cleanliness
and safety. Food handlers returning from medical leave are checked by their respective supervisors
16
ST Group Food Industries Holdings Limited
Sustainability Report 2020

to ensure that they are healthy to recommence work. Compliance with regulations or voluntary
codes concerning health and safety impacts of our food products is of paramount importance te
our business operations. We have excelled on this front and achieved zero instances of non
compliance with regulations or voluntary codes which we will maintain as a target for FY2021.
Franchising
The high standards of food safety across the Group and our portfolio of brands is achieved through
a sustained effort to engage our sub-franchisees and sub-licensees. We encourage franchisees to
procure food products from approved suppliers that meet our stringent quality standards to ensure
excellent food quality. Frequent communication and annual audits are carried out to ensure that
our sub-franchisees and sub-licensees are aware of the importance of health and safety
compliance and to share best practices in food preparation and safety
Customer Safety
GRI 416-1
We are committed to providing a safe and pleasant environment for our customers to dine at our
outlets. We implement measures to protect the safety of our customers such as providing safety
notices or barriers when our restaurant areas are being cleaned and limiting customers' access to
food preparation area. Our dining areas are designed to maximise the available foot space and
ergonomics for our patrons, ensuring a pleasant dining experience while minimising the occurrence
of accidents.
The Group engages experts to install pest control devices at restaurants and food manufacturing
facilities. Daily checks are also conducted to ensure that there are no pests breeding in fooo
storage/ consumption/ preparation areas or contaminations that may encourage pest breeding

COVID-19 Safety Measures for Customers
In FY2020, a newly discovered coronavirus emerged and resulted in the COVID-19 outbreak
which evolved into a global pandemic. During these unsettling times, we remain committed to our
 stakeholders and made the utmost effort to adhere to local COVID-19 regulations and measures.
To minimize the risk of transmission within the community, we have implemented various safety
measures in our restaurants including, but not limited to:
enforce proper social distancing.
 keep records for contact tracing;
promote usage of face masks and hand sanitisers whenever required, unless a lawful
exception applies;
encourage usage of contactless payments; and
 switch to take-away and food delivery services only
The Group has taken the initiative to formulate COVID-1 9 safety measure guidelines which outline
a comprehensive COVID- 1 9 safety checklist for restaurants to adopt and to adhere to. The COVID-
19 safety measure guidelines are essential in allowing the Group to continue operating in a safe
and responsible manner, and to prepare the Group to react and respond in the event of an infection
During FY2020, there were no incidents of non-compliance with COVID-19 safety rules and
regulations in all jurisdictions that the Group operates in.
FOCUS 2: OUR ENVIRONMENT
Recycling
GRI 301-2
We aim to reduce the usage of natural resources in our operations and have made efforts to reduce
the use of materials in the packaging for takeaway and delivery services. While the percentage of
recycled materials used in the packaging could not be obtained for the reporting period, we
always aim to engage suppliers who are sustainability focused. Where possible, we ensure that
suppliers are IS0 14001 Environmental Management System certified to manage the
environmental impact during the production of the packaging materials.
The Group encourages all outlets to separate their waste, and to dispose and recycle materials in
an environmentally friendly manner. We are also experimenting using compostable packaging in
takeaway and delivery services and will continue to increase our efforts to utilise recycled products
to minimize the environmental impact of our operations.

F&B RetaiI
The Group endeavours to maximise our energy conservation efforts to reduce our carbon footprint
and develop the environmental sustainability of our business. We aim to achieve energy
conservation by installing energy efficient LED lighting and embedding natural ventilation into our
outlet design. The Group carries out regular maintenance on the equipment in our restaurants to
ensure fuel combustion efficiency and performance. We strive to continue our efforts in
environmental sustainability and reduce energy consumption in our outlets in FY2021.
 It has always been our Group's goal to include sustainability features into our restaurant planning
and design. One such outlet, PappaRich Highpoint has incorporated a slew of sustainable design
features to enhance our customers' dining experience.
PappaRich Highpoint Outlet
PappaRich
PappaRich Highpoint is a store that features sustainably designed concepts and features. The
shopfront is bi-fold, allowing customers to enjoy the benefits of natural lighting and natural
airflow ventilation. The store design also features no permanent fixtures in the shopfront to further
enhance airflow and allow natural light to illuminate additional areas in the store. It also features
an open kitchen concept to let customers observe the meticulous preparation process that goes
into making our food and beverage products.

Central Kitchen
The Group's central kitchen has always strived to reduce the amount of fuel and energy used in
food preparation. Some of the initiatives taken include installing energy efficient LED lighting and
solar panels to generate clean energy. The solar panels provide a renewable, clean source of
energy for the facilities and when possible, excess solar energy generated may also be sold back
to the grid.
The energy consumption and emission at our central kitchen is summarised in the table below.

to reduce emission intensity and lessen the environmental impact of our business.

ST Group Food Industries Holdings Limited
Sustainability Report 2020

Energy saving is aligned with our environmental focus as it reduces the greenhouse gases emitted
from the Group's operations, either directly or indirectly. Reduction in energy use also leads to cost
savings by reducing overheads and expenses during food production.
Water and Effluents
GRI 303-1, 303-2, 303-3, 303-4
Our water sources are mainly derived from municipal sources. An assessment is conducted
regularly on how our Group uses water and any negative impact is quickly identified and promptly
addressed. Employees are encouraged to reduce wastage of water and to take ownership of the
water usage in their area of work. We take measures to monitor and reduce the environmental
impact of our water and effluent discharge and ensure that all used water is discharged into proper
sewage channels in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations.
Waste Management
GRI 306-1, 306-2
F&B RetaiI
We take great effort to reduce the amount of waste generated in our operations. Our F&B
operations and Franchising have the potential to generate large amounts of waste given the high
usage of food delivery containers. We have stopped using single use plastic bags in our restaurants
and our customers are encouraged to use their own bags and utensils whenever possible
The Group has ongoing used cooking oil collection arrangements with one of its major suppliers
where used cooking oil is recycled into biodiesel and other products. This major supplier is an
official Safe Quality Food ("SQF") certified supplier and is also accredited with HACCP food safety
In the months of January 2021 to March 2021, we estimated that approximately 58,000 litres of
used cooking oil have been collected by our supplier to be managed in an environmentally friendly
and responsible manner.
To maximise the available area in our restaurants, there are currently no separate bins for
recyclable and non-recyclable waste. In view of this, our staff have been leading recycling efforts
by separating generated waste such as carton boxes, aluminium drink cans into recyclable and
non-recyclable waste.
We regularly evaluate our waste management standards and operating practices to ensure that
there is an efficient management system in place, and that it complies strictly with local
environmental laws and regulations.

Initiatives to reduce waste include storing used cooking oils in containers to be sold back to our
suppliers to be manufactured into other products. As a result of the used cooking oils collection
initiative, we are able to dispose used cooking oils in an environmentally friendly manner, and also
to reduce on landfill by not using tins to dispose used cooking oils. All these measures help to cut
down carbon emission significantly. We are constantly on the lookout for opportunities to reduce
and manage waste efficiently.
 Target for
Reduce wastage through technology adoption and effective measures
FY2021
The above target articulates the Group's aim to maximise the use of resources in our supply chain
including identifying potential avenues to create further value for used resources such as recycling
used cooking oil, and to reduce waste generation.
Environmental Compliance
GRI 307-1
The Group complies strictly with local environmental laws and regulations where we operate, and
there was no incident of environmental non-compliance during FY2020. The Group has an
Environmental Policy Statement that is circulated to all employees to ensure that they are aware of
the Group's directions on environmental sustainability policies. We will strive to maintain zero
major environmental non-compliance in FY2021.
Targets for
Achieve zero major environmental non-compliance in the Group
FY2021
Achieve zero major incidents of environmental non-compliance at franchisee

Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is aligned with our corporate objective to
minimize negative environmental impact.
Supplier Environmental Assessment
GRI 308-1, 308-2
In addition to assessment of suppliers' product quality, we also carry out environmental impact
assessment on all new and existing suppliers across our supply chain. We ensure that our suppliers
utilise oils from sustainably grown sources such as certified palm oil and that no endangered
species have been harmed while obtaining the ingredients

We perform supplier due diligence upon initial contract negotiation and continue to engage our
suppliers on environmental issues through collaboration and monitoring. Suppliers' environmental
compliance is assessed against predetermined criteria agreed between our Group and our
suppliers. Supplier assessment and performance is informed through subsequent contractual
reviews and compliance and grievance mechanisms.
In FY2020, no suppliers have been identified as having significant actual and potential negative
environmental impact.
