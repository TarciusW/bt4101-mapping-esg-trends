SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019






MESSAGE 

FROM CEO

Our sustainability strategy is deeply rooted in our 

company’s adaption to continuous transformation. 

Over the past few years, we have continued to 

build the foundations that will help us deliver our 

sustainability objectives. As we operate in today’s 

unpredictable environment, we recognize the 

increasing importance for responsible business 

practices, as societies around the world become 

more intertwined.

The spread of the Coronavirus in the first few months 

of 2020 have impacted the entire world and our lives in 

an unprecedented manner. Our focus is to protect the 

wellbeing of our colleagues, and ensuring the continuity 

of service for our clients. While we cannot fully anticipate 

the future resulting from seismic shifts to our way of life, 

this crisis will be a test of our resilience and agility to adapt 

and thrive in a post-pandemic world. 

We view sustainability as a journey of continuous learning, 

adapting and improving. 2019 saw us identifying new 

opportunities to better our sustainability approach, 

integrating it throughout the services that we provide. 

Together with our partners, we sought to reduce our 

environmental footprint through innovative sustainable 

practices across our operations. At the core of our strategic 

priorities, is the focus on broadening and deepening the 

sustainable employability of our people. Efforts to upskill 

and develop them to be relevant and effective in this fast-

changing economy is ongoing. 

The global pandemic has heightened the awareness of 

the importance of technology and digital solutions in the 

way we work and services we offer. These coupled with 

a well-trained and knowledgeable team will enable our 

sustainable and innovative steps forward. 

On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank every member of 

the Group for their tireless contribution and all stakeholders 

for their continued support and belief in us. The road ahead 

will be different, but I believe that we can rally together and 

emerge stronger and better.

practice and aims to bring shared values and constantly challenge the way 

we work in order to achieve our business objectives:

Our vision is to become sustainably

issues into our business model and 

implement sustainable and responsible 

practices to mitigate them.

OUR  

PEOPLE

We are a learning organisation and 

have committed to nurturing an 

ecosystem that is built on mutual 

respect and trust. Embedded in our 

core values, we believe in helping 

our people from all backgrounds 

to build a rewarding career and 

achieve their full potential. We 

recognize that our success lies in 

them and strive to empower them 

to be game changers. Offering 

them opportunities to develop and 

grow, we believe that this holistic 

development is an investment in 

sustainable employability and the 

key to our continuous success. 

We value diversity and leveraging 

on the expertise of our people to 

build a competitive workforce. This 

includes prioritising talent attraction 

and retention, creating a safe 

working environment and investing 

in training and development.

Our human resource Policies 

and Code of Conduct cover fair 

remuneration, benefits, health and 

safety, career development and 

training and are regularly reviewed 

by our management. The policies 

comply with the legal standards in 

the areas we operate in. 

TALENT STRATEGY 

We aim to build a sustainable 

leadership pipeline of talents that will 

be nurtured to be future leaders of the 

organization. As part of our leadership 

renewal plans, we participate in the 

Singapore-Industry Scholarship (SgIS) – 

a partnership between the Government 

and Kingsmen to develop a strong core 

of Singaporeans to anchor strategic 

sectors which are critical for Singapore’s 

development. In FY2019, we welcomed 

an additional scholar on board, bringing 

the total to eight. 

In FY2019, we further revamped and 

streamlined the annual performance 

appraisal framework to develop a 

more comprehensive performance 

measurement for employees. The 

exercise emphasized the following 

objectives: 

•

Target setting through individual and

measurable goals

•

Framework for career development

discussion

•

Enhance employee’s understanding

of the Organisation’s core values

•

360° feedback to identify

development needs

This initiative seeks to promote a high-

performance culture and strategically 

manage and develop a strong talent 

pool. 

We also promote internal mobility 

and specifically monitor competency 

requirements for strategically critical 

roles and maintain a look out for high-

potential internal candidates, providing 

them with development opportunities.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019


OUR  

PEOPLE

TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT – 

KINGSMEN ACADEMY

We promote and support employee 

development and organizational 

effectiveness by providing high-

quality training programmes that are 

aligned with the strategic needs of 

our organisation. By investing across 

creative, technical and leadership 

skills, we provide our people with 

opportunities for professional and 

personal development, keeping them 

engaged with the industry. All new 

Kingsmen employees undergo an 

onboarding programme, which exposes 

them to the culture of Kingsmen, a 

broad overview of the Company, and 

knowledge of their day-to-day job roles 

and responsibilities. 



The training curriculum is guided by 

our strategy on employee development 

and consists of various programmes 

that range from core functional 

competencies to leadership capabilities 

and life skills. These include on-the-

job training and coaching, and the 

mentorship programme which provides 

a unique opportunity for identified 

employees to engage and learn from 

senior management through casual 

engagement sessions. 



At Kingsmen, “Educating through 

Engagement” is a working and 

practicable maxim that places training 

right in the career path of our people. 

Training sessions are designed to 

enhance individual learning and build 

employee capability. The Kingsmen 

Academy continues to evolve its learning 

and development programmes offered 

to adapt to its strategic needs.   

In FY2019, we stepped up efforts to 

offer training programmes that shape an 

innovative culture that can easily adapt 

in a continuously transforming business 

landscape. Together with professionals, 

the top management identifies the 

most important strategic needs for 

the busines and translates these into 

relevant learning and development 

programmes.

KINGSMEN CREATIVES LTD 




LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT 

Through a structured leadership 

development framework, we develop 

skilled leadership competencies that 

create a strong foundation to become 

future leaders. Our annual regional 

conferences are aimed at accelerating 

the development of a strong regional 

talent pool across the Group. The 

conferences address change, culture, 

and thought leadership. These are 

opportunities for future leaders to 

sharpen their skills to be effective leaders 

in critical leadership positions. 

In FY2019, 82 delegates attended the 

Group Leadership Conference, and 

60 delegates went through the Group 

Managers Forum. This approach ensures 

that high-potential employees who 

are not yet in a leadership position are 

identified and nurtured. 

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT 

An engaged and inspired workforce 

is essential to retaining the brightest 

talent that is essential to the works 

that we bring alive. We use formal 

and informal engagement sessions 

to ensure that an inclusive work 

environment is cultivated. To promote 

a culture of open communication, 

constant interaction is maintained 

between managers and their teams to 

monitor the well-being of employees. 

In FY2019, we invited employees from 

different functions and teams to attend 

a dialogue session series with the top 

management team to communicate 

and connect in a more intimate setting. 

These sessions motivate attendees 

to share their views and address any 

concerns they may have. The feedback 

gathered during the sessions help the 

leadership team formulate and identify 

effective culture drivers.

Our Sports &amp; Recreation Committee 

also organizes various events to bring 

employees together outside of their 

daily work – from our annual Dinner and 

Dance to sports-related events, health 

talks and other special interest activities.  

WORKPLACE HEALTH &amp; SAFETY

We continue our commitment to 

ensuring the health &amp; safety of all our 

employees and conduct our business 

in accordance with all workplace health 

and safety laws, standards, and codes of 

practice. The committee ensures that we 

comply with all regulatory requirements, 

conduct safety onsite inspections, fire 

safety plans, and enforces safety-related 

trainings of all operational staff.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019




OUR  

COMMUNITY

At Kingsmen, we believe we have a 

responsibility to improve the lives of 

those in the communities we operate 

in and focus on initiatives that will 

contribute where it matters and have a 

positive impact. Beyond corporate work, 

our community strategy is focused on 

areas of education, design, and youth.  

Our focus on supporting youth 

empowerment is an extension of our 

motto of continuous learning that has 

become synonymous with Kingsmen. 

We therefore connect our employees 

with the marginalised youth through our 

support for the beneficiaries’ community 

engagement work. We also participate in 

other community initiatives on a selective 

basis, ensuring that it is aligned with our 

community engagement objective. 

In FY2019, we continue to partner 

with SHINE Children &amp; Youth Services 

(formerly known as “Students Care 

Service”) in giving back to the youth as 

a means of engaging our employees 

and contributing to the community. 

In partnering with SHINE, we strive to 

inspire youth to dream big. Partnering 

with social workers from SHINE, 

Kingsmen staff assist with the school-

based programme which consists of 

activities designed to help students 

develop social and life skills. 

Across Asia, we also proactively promote 

public interest by supporting community 

growth and development through 

regional office efforts. Each Kingsmen 

office organizes its own community 

engagement programmes including 

extending pro bono services. 









KINGSMEN BURSARY

Based on the dogma, “Charity starts 

from home”, we launched the ‘Kingsmen 

Bursary’ in 2008 which aims to alleviate 

the financial burden faced by some of 

our employees in providing for their 

children’s education.

OUR 

ENVIRONMENT 



Our sustainability approach ensures 

that we generate value for both 

our organization and our clients 

throughout the planning and 

execution phase of our projects. 

We understand that our business 

processes can have positive and 

negative environmental impacts 

and we do our part to minimise 

our environmental footprint while 

maximising the positive longer-

term impacts. 

SUSTAINABLE WORKING 

ENVIRONMENT 

We are a part of the global effort to sustain 

and better manage our resources and are 

constantly seeking ways to deliver more 

environmentally-friendly projects. 

Some of our conservation initiatives 

include adopting environmentally-

friendly practices into our processes, 

including all our offices and production 

plants to minimise the impact of our 

business operations on the environment. 

As part of our standard operating 

procedures, we also reduce energy and 

water consumption. 

Kingsmen works continually to reduce 

our energy consumption and cost is 

monitored regularly to identify how the 

greatest energy savings can be achieved. 

Within offices, timers and temperature 

controls are set for air conditioners to 

avoid unnecessary energy consumption 

and regular maintenance is arranged to 

ensure that power is used efficiently. In the 

production plants, equipment is regularly 

maintained and upgraded to enhance 

electricity efficiency. Project scheduling at 

production plants ensure that equipment 

is operating at optimal efficiency to reduce 

unnecessary energy consumption.  

To reduce our carbon footprint, the 

Group promotes remote meetings and 

collaboration technologies to conduct 

meetings, reducing business travel. 

Our Green Committee champions 

environmentalism within the Group 

and employees are actively involved 

in fulfilling our Green philosophy, by 

engaging in green practices within our 

day-to-day operations. 

SUSTAINABLE DESIGN &amp; WASTE 

MANAGEMENT

Our sustainable initiative is also extended 

to our rental service offerings that 

include more than 100 furniture types 

to reduce the material consumption 

at events. In addition, we also offer 

clients the option of recycling custom-

built booth components to reduce 

waste and provide turnkey services for 

storage to refurbishment after each 

show, extending the lifespan of the built 

materials. Increasingly, we are exploring 

the extensive use of new technologies 

and materials to reduce waste and help 

our clients create unique experiences 

that create more value. 

The Kingsmen Environmental Policy 

clearly specifies that our suppliers 

and partners are briefed on our waste 

management policy and on-site 

supervisors ensure compliance. 

Our designers and project personnel 

advocate green design during 

the planning process and there is 

collaborative effort to seek ways to 

make projects more eco-friendly with 

the introduction of new innovative 

products and materials to minimize 

the amount of waste we generate. We 

also consider environmental impacts 

in our recommendations to clients and 

during procurement. 

In support of the global movement 

for environment protection, our work 

for L’Oréal Travel Retail Asia Pacific’s 

booth at Tax Free World Association 

(TFWA) 2019 show showcased efforts 

of green exhibiting. Material and 

production details were re-examined 

to create sustainable design that could 

be repurposed. Opting for modular 

structures and recycled materials, we 

kept wastage to a minimum. Greener 

application was selected in water-based 

paint and using glues and stickers as we 

move away from conventional build 

requiring staple and nails. This was 

recognized in World Exhibitions Stand 

Awards 2020 when the project clinched 

Silver for Best Sustainable Stand. 

Our sustainable initiative is also boosted 

by our ongoing furniture rental schemes, 

allowing for reusability and adaptability. 

Please refer to our Green Policy for  

full details.

OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL 

INITIATIVES

Since FY2019, we have ceased mailing 

our physical copies for our annual report 

and will write to shareholders to explain 

that the same information is available 

on our website. Physical copies will be 

made available only upon request. 

We acknowledge that change is necessary 

but it is a long-term ongoing process, 

as these are practices well entrenched 

in the industries we operate in, but we 

will continue to work with our business 

partners to raise their awareness and look 

to reduce our carbon footprint through 

innovative ways. 

Sustainable supply chain management 

drives organisational excellence. We 

have policies and procedures in place for 

the procurement process and stringent 

checks on vendor qualification and 

evaluation to reduce risk. We continue 

to reduce our environmental impact 

and encourage stakeholders such as 

suppliers and subcontractors to meet 

the same expectations. We will ensure 

that all new vendors will be screened, 

evaluated and selected in accordance 

to their conduct and performance on 

environmental factors.
