We are pleased to present GEAR’s second sustainability report for the financial year ended 31 December 2018 

(“FY 2018”). It highlights our policies, practices and performances with regards to Environmental, Social and 

Governance (“ESG”) matters which are most material to our business and our stakeholders, with comparison to 

data from FY 2017 and FY 2016, where applicable. 

The disclosures in this report are mainly focused on the coal mining operations of our key subsidiary, PT Borneo 

Indobara (“BIB”). Within the group, BIB bears the largest impact on our sustainability performance due to its 

production volume. As our sustainability reporting matures over the next few years, we will be including other 

operations in our reporting scope should they become significant.

This report has been prepared with reference to the Global Reporting Initiatives (“GRI”) Standards and its GRI Mining 

and Metals sector supplement. We have chosen GRI Standards as our reporting framework due to its internationally-

recognised, robust guidance and universal application, which enables comparability of our performance. We have 

not yet sought external assurance on the disclosures made but will consider seeking independent verification for 

sustainability reporting as our reporting matures over time.

For any queries in relation to this report, please address them to Ms. Pauline Lee at paulinelee@gear.com.sg.

ABOUT THIS REPORT 

Sustainability Report 2018 l Golden Energy and Resources Limited

01


Dear stakeholders,

The Board of Directors (“The Board”) is pleased to present our FY 2018 sustainability report (“Sustainability 

Report") which summarises our performance and commitment towards material ESG matters. Indonesia remains 

as one of the world’s largest coal exporters. As a coal producer, world coal demand stays very relevant to our 

business. According to the International Energy Agency’s latest coal market report, Coal 2018, global coal demand 

is forecasted to remain stable over the next five years.

To keep pace with the coal demand and dynamics of the coal market, we have established a robust framework where 

Golden Energy and Resources Limited (“GEAR”) creates sustainable and consistent value for our stakeholders, 

including our shareholders. As we continue to grow and expand our business, sustainable growth and practices, 

together with transparent disclosure, have become increasingly important. In the long-term, we believe that our 

focus on sustainability will place us in a better position to enhance value for our shareholders, while looking after 

the needs of the broader stakeholder community.

Taking into account the ESG matters in our strategic formulation, the Board sets the tone at the top and works 

closely with the senior management to identify and oversee the management and monitoring of the material ESG 

matters. This Sustainability Report marks the continuation of our ongoing efforts towards sustainable development.

At GEAR, we place an emphasis on substantial efforts to integrate with local population where our mines are located. 

As part of our social responsibility, we engage in activities and programmes to provide economic, technical, social, 

infrastructure, educational and healthcare assistance to the local communities. We provide the local communities 

with new employment opportunities by recruiting and training local communities to work in our mines. We believe 

that these efforts are integral to the stability and development of GEAR.

Sustainability means more than just proactive business practices. It is also a long-term investment in growth drivers 

for an efficient workforce, an extensive network, and enduring expertise. Our performance in 2018 is our strongest 

on record in terms of production and revenue, and we are excited to build on the current momentum that we 

have generated. In FY 2018, we have set stringent safety targets of 0.20 and 11.0 for lost time injury frequency rate 

(“LTIFR”) and lost time injury severity rate (“LTISR”) respectively. We are pleased to convey that we have achieved 

our internal performance targets in FY 2018 and moving stronger towards the future. For areas where targets were 

not achieved, we will continue to strive towards improvement.

ENGAGING OUR STAKEHOLDERS 


It is crucial for GEAR’s future sustainability growth to establish which ESG matters are material to enable us to 

focus on key matters pertaining to our stakeholders’ interests. To achieve this, we conducted a formal materiality 

assessment in 2017 with key personnel from respective departments, including both internal and external 

stakeholders, with the guidance of independent sustainability consultants. The process, detailed in Figure 6 below, 

takes into account GRI’s Principles for Defining Report Content and focuses on the material matters determination 

process. The results are laid out in Figure 7.

Figure 6: Materiality Assessment Process

1. IDENTIFICATION

• From the interview results of GEAR's 

key 

internal 

stakeholders 

and 

a 

review of material matters reported 

by other companies in the industry, a 

comprehensive list of potential material 

matters formed the basis for determing 

comparative materiality.

4. STAKEHOLDER INCLUSIVENESS

• Review material sustainability matters 

in subsequent reporting periods for 

continuing relevance.

2. PRIORITISATION

• The importance of each sustainability 

matter was ranked by way of an 

anonymous voting exercise, from the 

perspective of:

 

a) External stakeholders

 

b) Internal stakeholders

3. VALIDATION

• The results were then presented 

to the Board, which has the overall 

responsibility 

in 

determining 

the 

material sustainability matters of GEAR. 

The Board validated and approved the 

material sustainability.

EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS

Emergency preparedness is at the cornerstone of GEAR’s efforts towards protecting our stakeholders. We strive to 

anticipate and be sufficiently ready to handle all possible types of emergency should they occur. Guided by our Emergency 

Readiness and Response Policy as detailed in Figure 9, we have measures in place to prevent and contain emergency 

situations to minimise damage to our assets, environment and stakeholders.





In FY 2018, we have improved in the way we conducted 

emergency simulations. Risk-based emergency scenarios 

were carefully chosen, which covers various high-risk work 

areas including pit operation, hauling road, port facility 

and project areas. In FY 2018, we conducted 15 emergency 

simulations involving 95 employees and 148 contractors, a 

36% increase in number of simulations and a 63% increase 

in participants from FY 2017. The increase in number of 

events and participants was intended to improve the 

overall competency in emergency response preparedness 

while anticipating the growth of coal mining operation in 

the company.

From the simulations, notable opportunities were identified 

for improvements, including the need for additional rescue 

tools for specific emergency scenarios, the need to speed 

up emergency response time, the need for additional oil 

spill equipment, and more training to improve the skills 

and teamwork of our Emergency Response Team (“ERT”) 

members.

Figure 9: Elements of GEMS’ Emergency Readiness and Response Policy

Types of emergency 

covered by the policy

preparedness

Evaluation and audit

• Accidents which result in 

fatality(ies)

• Fires and explosions

• Leakage of chemicals and 

biological substances

• Spill of hydrocarbons (over 

200 litres to ground or over 

100 litres to water bodies)

• Collapsed buildings, 

land slides and drowning 

incidents

• Blockade, mass 

demonstration and bomb 

threats

• Natural disasters  

(e.g. flood, windstorm)

• Emergency simulations 

are done for all types of 

possible emergencies 

as identified by the HSE 

Manager and as approved 

by the Mining Head at the 

start of each year

• The frequencies of 

emergency simulations are 

as follows:

• Full-scale (covering all 

concession areas): At 

least once a year

• Limited scale (covering 

selected areas): At least 

twice a year

• Administrative 

simulations: At least once 

every three months

• All employees and visitors 

are briefed on potential 

hazards at the mine, as well 

as steps to be taken during 

an emergency, including 

communications protocol 

and evacuation plans.

• ERT is required to attend 

emergency simulations.

• Evaluation is done at each 

emergency simulation to 

assess the readiness of 

the Company and the ERT 

in handling emergency 

situations.

• Audit is carried out to 

ensure that all procedures 

relating to emergency 

preparedness exercise have 

been done and evaluated 

for areas of improvement.

• The results of evaluation 

and audit are submitted for 

management's review.

To ensure smooth implementation of mitigation actions in the event of an emergency, our Mining Head established an ERT, 

consisting of representatives from our employees, workers and contractors’ employees. All members are equipped with a 

Deployment Card, which contains a guide on emergency procedures, administrative forms and emergency checklist. The 

Deployment card serves a dual purpose: to ensure that the ERT is coordinated and well prepared to handle emergencies, 

and to ensure that other employees can replace ERT members who are not present at the site during the emergency.

Moving forward, we aim to improve our overall capacity in emergency response through:

• 

Strengthening our ERT structure

• 

Improving the competencies of our ERT members

• 

Constructing our ERT First Aid Station and Emergency Response (“ER”) Command Centre

• 

Procuring additional rescue tools for vehicle extrication, water rescue, firefighting, confined space rescue and high 

angle rescue

• 

Conducting emergency simulations for handling situations including fatality prevention and oil spill related scenarios

in May 2018. Furthermore, the ERT organisation was revitalised by recruiting 10 voluntary ERT members from various 

departments and contractors.

• 

Trainings in emergency response skills were conducted by internal trainers twice a week, covering basic emergency 

response skills such as basic firefighting, basic first aid and basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Advanced trainings 

were also conducted by external expert trainers to cover more specific emergency rescue scenario such as vehicle 

accident rescue, water rescue, high angle rescue and mud accident rescue.

• 

Procurement of essential emergency rescue tools had been partially completed, consisting of basic vehicle extrication 

equipment, high angle rescue tools and self-contained breathing apparatus.

• 

Procurement of essential emergency rescue equipment, consisting of one four-wheel drive ambulance in accordance 

with mining standards and one unit motorised rubber boat for sea rescue.

• 

Technical design of new buildings for an emergency command centre and satellite first aid station had been 

completed.

• 

Risk-based emergency simulations have been conducted, covering emergency situations such as heavy-duty vehicle 

accident rescue, fire rescue, water rescue, falling from height, mine slope failure, mud rescue, and oil spill response.

HEALTH AND SAFETY 

PROTECTION OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS


OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH &amp; SAFETY

Occupational Health &amp; Safety (“OHS”) is deeply 

ingrained in our corporate ethos, which is 

centred on human capital. Mining operations 

invariably pose health and safety risks to our 

employees and workers, but we leverage on the 

highest safety standards to drive operational 

excellence and achieve sustainable growth. Our 

OHS management is administered by our Health, 

Safety and Environment (“HSE”) Department, 

whose structure is shown in Figure 12. We have 

implemented policies and extensive measures 

to limit these risks from developing into actual 

hazards, as shown in Figure 13, which are reviewed 

periodically to ensure continued relevance and 

compliance with the most updated regulatory 

requirements. Our OHS management includes 

the management of our safety systems to the 

following standards:

• 

Mining Safety Management System by 

ESDM of Indonesia; and

• 

ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and 

Safety Management System

Various safety trainings were conducted in FY 

2018, mainly centred around the Energi Dan 

Sumber Daya Mineral Republik Indonesia 1827 

K/30/MEM/2018 

concerning 

Good 

Mining 

Engineering Code of Conduct Guidelines issued 

by the ESDM.

In aggregate, 120 employees and contractors had 

passed the ESDM examination in FY 2018.



In December 2018, BIB attained the ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety Management System certification. 

The Management expects that the implementation of ISO 45001 will improve employee safety, reduce workplace risks, 

and create a safer working environment, which in turn will reduce occupational injuries and diseases at BIB. We have 

undertaken increased emphasis on training employees and contractors to operate plants and equipment, including heavy 

equipment and vehicles, thereby increasing the competency of these employees and contractors in taking care of our 

machineries at BIB.

HEALTH AND SAFETY 

PROTECTION OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS


We strive to cultivate an OHS culture where our employees and workers have a sense of ownership, working together to 

create a safe environment for one another. On that front, we conduct compulsory safety trainings and daily safety toolbox 

meetings for all employees and workers at the mining site. In FY 2018, 121 employees took part in safety training sessions 

during the National OHS month. To commemorate National OHS month, various occupational health and safety events 

were conducted during the period of 12 January to 12 February 2018.

Part of the participation from our employees and workers to identify and mitigate OHS exposures is incident reporting. 

All our employees and workers are strongly encouraged to report safety incidents, including near-misses, using a standard 

incident reporting form. The Root Cause Analysis (“RCA”) method is used to investigate the root cause of each incident 

and to implement corrective actions to prevent reoccurrence. To maintain the quality of inveion, at least one member of 

the investigation team has gone through RCA training. After each investigation, the HSE Department categorises the 

incidents based on the type (health, safety or environment) and degree of severity (light, heavy or fatal). All reported 

incidents are subsequently recorded at our centralised HSE portal for data analytics and audit trail.

As part of our approach towards monitoring and managing our safety performance, we set an internal target (“threshold”) 

for our safety statistics. The threshold for work-related fatality is set at zero at all times, and we have consistently achieved 

this for three consecutive years, FY 2016, FY 2017 and FY 2018. Furthermore, we have set stringent thresholds for LTIFR2 and 

LTISR3 based on the best practices in the industry, as reflected in the audit scoring scheme from the ESDM.

Based on the regulation, the criteria of the safety management audit shall include: policy, plans; organisation and personnel; implementation; 

evaluation and follow-up actions; documentation; and management review.

There was a decrease in LTIFR and LTISR due to an increase in safety awareness among employees and workers, which 

includes spreading the awareness of our safety policies through employee and worker engagements, as well as trainings 

that our employees must undergo.

To maintain the rigour and effectiveness of our safety management systems, we conduct annual internal audit for our mining 

sites in accordance with ESDM 1827K 2018, where we achieved a score of 94.7% for BIB and 87% for BIB’s contractors. 

Based on various criteria4, the highest score was 97% and the lowest score was 68%. In FY 2018, we organised 43 safety 

investigation trainings for our frontline supervisors as we continually strive to improve our performance for future years.

There were no work-related injuries in the Singapore office for three consecutive years, from FY 2016 to FY 2018.

Safety Trainings during the National OHS Month

Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Determining Control (“HIRADC”) Training

The HIRADC Training was conducted to develop team leaders in identifying hazards in their daily working 

activities. During the training, the participants were tasked to perform risk analysis and determine risk controls 

to prevent unwanted incidents. Through the completion of this training, our team leaders are now qualified to 

perform risk analysis independently on their operational activities, thereby minimising the likelihood and severity 

of potential incidents.

Safety Leadership Training

This training was conducted to raise awareness on safety and accountability of selected operational supervisors. 

It is made known to them their responsibilities, such as leading safety briefings and meetings, conducting 

safety inspections, and engaging in safety observations of employees while performing their tasks. Through this 

training, supervisors are encouraged to be role models in nurturing a healthy and safe working culture amongst 

all employees.

AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT

It is imperative that we implement air quality management programmes to minimise the release of nitrogen oxides (NOx), 

sulphur oxides (SOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and total suspended particulate (TSP) to the environment which may be 

released from our operations. On that front, we set our targets for air quality maintenance in accordance with the upper 

limits set by the Indonesian Government, and engage an accredited external laboratory to monitor the quality of ambient 

air in our sites on a quarterly basis. Figures 16 to 19 summarise the test results. We have met the air emission limits in BIB 

concession areas in 2018.

Additionally, we implemented a Standard Operating Procedure “Collection and processing of Genset Emission Test Data” 

as a guidance on measuring emission on generators to comply with threshold limit set by the Ministry of Environmental 

Regulation No 21 – 2008.

In FY 2018, we have met the local government regulations of ambient air for NO2, SO2 and CO. It was noted that in Q2, 

Q3 and Q4, the ambient air emission for TSP had crossed the limit set by the local government. In response to this, our 

mitigation plans for the following year include:

• 

Additional water trucks are to be deployed to manage the dust at Kusan mining area during the dry season, as 

the applied dust suppression spray operated during Q2 and Q4 was insufficient to curb the significant particulates 

caused by crushing activities.

• 

Re-engineering of all machineries at the Girimulya mining workshop has been performed to reduce emissions 

caused by strong winds during dry season, as there was unforeseen breakdowns of water spray trucks.

• 

Additional dust suppression equipment is installed at all facilities at Bunati port to mitigate the TSP due to 

surrounding active ports.

As part of our operations, we regularly monitor our energy 

consumption and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions 

into the atmosphere.  In addition, we recognise our role in 

complying to the local regulatory limits and also consuming 

energy efficiently.  Both Singapore and Indonesia have 

pledged5 to reduce GHG emissions as per the Paris Accord. 

In December 2018, BIB attained the ISO 14001:2015 

Environmental Management System, an assurance to 

our management and employees, as well as external 

stakeholders that environmental impact is being measured 

and improved.

In Indonesia where our main operational activities are 

carried out, the government encourages the use of 

B15-graded biodiesel by all mining companies in its effort 

to achieve its GHG emission reduction target.



5 Singapore committed to reduce its GHG emissions intensity by 36% from 2005 levels by 2030, while Indonesia committed to reduce its GHG emissions by 

29% from business-as-usual scenario by 2030.

25

Sustainability Report 2018 l Golden Energy and Resources Limited

NURTURING THE ENVIRONMENT 


We are gradually adopting the B10-graded biodiesel in our operations in a bid to join national efforts in reducing GHG emissions. 

In FY 2018, we consumed a mixture of petrodiesel, gasoline and B10-graded biodiesel in our operations.

Some of our contractors were still using B10-graded biodiesel which was sourced from smaller- scale suppliers. In order to 

meet our increased biodiesel consumption in FY 2018, we are currently engaging larger suppliers to supply higher-graded 

biodiesel to our contractors.

In FY 2018, we have increased the consumption of bio-diesel by 69% from 6,702 m3 in FY 2017 to 11,328 m3 in FY 2018. 

Overall, the total fuel consumption at BIB has increased by 56% from FY 2017 to FY 2018 due to increased volume of 

production and activities.

Our consumption of petrodiesel and gasoline (non-renewable energy) in terms of energy was 4,285 terajoules (TJ) in total, 

while our consumption of biodiesel (renewable energy) in terms of energy was 272 TJ, in FY 2018. The increase in fuel 

consumption has also led to an increase in Scope 16 GHG emissions. In FY 2018, our GHG emission intensity from fossil 

fuels (petrodiesel and gasoline) was 15.68 Kg CO2/metric tonne production at BIB.

The electricity consumption at BIB has increased by 33.9% from FY 2017 to FY 2018 due to a higher production volume. 

As a result, our Scope 27 GHG emissions, arising from grid electrical energy, have also increased. However, our energy 

and emission intensity due to electricity consumption has decreased due to electricity saving and a significant increase in 

production volume.

SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT

Solid waste management, which includes the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste, is integral to 

reduce adverse effects of waste on human health and the environment.

For better land rehabilitation at the post-mining stage, we remain dedicated to minimise the environmental damage and 

safety hazards due to the structural failure of overburden pile with proper storage and disposal in accordance with our 

Waste Dumping Policy.

Figure 24: Elements of GEMS’ Waste Dumping Policy

Waste Dumping Policy

• 

Two ways of waste dumping:

– 

Direct dumping – dumping of material using a haul truck at the dump crest

– 

Indirect dumping – dumping of material using a haul truck at a safe distance away from the dump crest, to be 

pushed by a dozer towards the dump crest

• 

Identification of potentially acid forming (“PAF”) and non-acid forming (“NAF”) substances.

– 

PAF should not be placed at the ground surface.

– 

NAF may be used to encapsulate PAF, with a minimum thickness of 10 metres

• 

Mud is to be mixed with other material prior to dumping, to maintain slope stability.

• 

Overburden and other waste can only be dumped at specific dumping locations as assigned by the Mine Planning and 

Development (“MPD”) department, taking into account geotechnical and geoengineering considerations.

– 

Overburden is to be reused for land reclamation before rehabilitation works are carried out.

• 

The active and inactive dumping areas are to be monitored by our geotechnical engineers at all times to prevent 

landslides.

NURTURING THE ENVIRONMENT 


Being in a waste-intensive industry, we generated a significant amount of solid waste, mostly in the form of overburden, 

which consists of clay, silt and sandstone that came from material covered coal. In FY 2018, total cumulative overburden 

was 98,727,410 bank cubic metres (”BCM“) of overburden (Figure 25), due to the expansion of our operations and low 

reclamation in FY 2017. We have used approximately 8,990,000 BCM of overburden for rehabilitating 97.95 hectares in 

FY 2018, while the remaining 89,737,410 BCM of overburden will be used to reclaim and rehabilitate 281.35 hectares of 

land.

As part of our solid waste management, we also encourage employees to minimise in-house waste such as office waste 

and domestic waste by holding the Kreasi Enviro Contest to raise awareness on waste generation.

LAND MANAGEMENT

Our coal resources and reserves in BIB are mostly located in forested areas. While we hold the License to Borrow and 

Use of Forest Areas (Izin Pinjam Pakai Kawasan Hutan or “IPPKH”), we recognise our role in restoring the function of the 

natural environment through reclamation and rehabilitation. Having mined the resources, we are committed to returning 

the mined land to its original state and/or for its intended purpose. As our employees and local communities will be 

affected by land management, we strive to prevent environment contamination, as well as erosion and landslides that 

could potentially occur. BIB has expanded its manpower capability for reclamation to ensure the quality of reclamation by 

minimising the disturbed area and maximising dumping to mine-out pit. The policy is shown in Figure 26.

Kreasi Enviro Contest

“Kreasi Enviro” is an open competition for all employees 

to demonstrate their ideas of turning domestic waste 

into useful items, an intended activity to engage 

employees and raise awareness on green living and life 

cycle perspectives in their daily activities. Waste such 

as paper, plastic, tin can, tyre were converted to photo 

frames and decorative household items.

Figure 26: Elements of GEMS’ land reclamation policy

Our practices include developing a mine closure and reclamation plan before the commencement of mining activities at all 

our concession areas. This reclamation plan is approved by the ESDM, and serves as a guide for our rehabilitation efforts. 

In FY 2018, we obtained a score of 60% and above during the independent audit on the reclamation progress conducted 

by ESDM, without any findings of non-compliance. Our Mine Closure and Reclamation Plan consists of 60% reclamation 

and 40% rehabilitation. At the moment, the reclamation process, including land preparation, is complete. We will proceed 

with the revegetation of reclaimed land as per the Mine Closure and Reclamation Plan.

In FY 2018, we rehabilitated 98 hectares of land, more than double the 44 hectares in FY 2017. Due to an increase in 

production, our disturbed area in FY 2018 was 704 hectares, 7.6% higher than the original plan of 655 hectares. Our total 

cumulative land disturbed and not yet rehabilitated is 2,208 hectares in FY 2018, an increase from 1,270 hectares in FY 2017. 

Although the submitted reclamation plan to the ESDM was 74.54 hectares for FY 2018, we have realised 97.95 hectares 

in FY 2018 including those outstanding for FY 2017 of 23.41 hectares. Moving forward, our reclamation target for FY 2019 

would be approximately 87.28 hectares.

Our detailed evaluation methods of land management are shown in Figure 27 below.

Figure 27: Evaluation of land management approach

WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

The local community surrounding our concession areas is dependent on the surrounding water bodies to serve their 

day-to-day needs. We hold a responsibility to ensure that our effluent discharged does not pollute the water bodies by 

complying with the applicable regulatory limits, as shown in Figure 28 below.

Figure 28: GEMS’ approach towards effluent management

Stakeholder feedback

The ESDM inspects and verifies the Company’s site before the deposit fund is transferred 

back every year. We will then follow up with the verification report and improvements will 

be taken into consideration.

Internal audit/verification

The Environment Department inspects and monitors the progress of land management 

yearly.

External audit/verification

The progress of reclamation is evaluated in terms of quantity and quality.

Benchmarking to similar mining company

The practices of BIB are compared with other practices applied by other mining 

companies. We try to adopt the best practices wherever possible and review 

current practices to achieve better results.

 

In addition, 

on-site testing 

is conducted 

by the ESDM 

annually.

Effluent Treatment and Monitoring

A sedimentation pond has to be constructed 

at each mining area prior to the

commencement of mining activities, 

to control acid drainage and prevent erosion.

GEMS’ effluent is treated at the 

sedimentation ponds before it is discharged.

Whenever the 

water quality 

reaches its 

upper limits, 

the effluent is 

treated using 

pH adjuster, 

caustic soda and 

soda ash at the 

sedimentation 

ponds.

During

treatment 

activities, water 

pumping at the 

sedimentation 

ponds is stopped 

and the ponds’ 

spillway is closed 

to prevent 

the release of 

water into the 

surroundings.

Dredging is 

done  

periodically to 

remove  

collected 

sediment, which 

is transported 

to a dedicated 

disposal area.

The pH,  

turbidity, 

acidity and 

metal content 

of effluent is 

monitored daily 

by GEMS and 

monthly by 

an accredited 

laboratory.

The test results 

are submitted 

to the local 

Governor once

every quarter.

Figures 29 to 33 present the quality of effluents from our mining operations in FY 2018. We have ensured all our parameters 

to be under the upper limit set by the local government for total suspended solids (“TSS”), average pH value, cadmium 

content, iron content and manganese content.

The measurements are carried out on treated effluents before being released into surrounding water bodies, and are 

done monthly by an external laboratory. In addition, we also monitor the water quality of rivers around our site. However, 

the data for water quality in surrounding rivers is not within the focus on this report, as there are various factors affecting 

the data, including the presence of other mining companies nearby. We will continue to strive to improve the quality of 

effluents arising from our mining activities.

To ensure that the local communities have a channel to voice their opinions regarding our operations, we have formalised 

GEMS’ External Relations Department where stakeholders can submit their feedback on our sites’ operations. When 

feedback is received, GEMS’ Chief Operating Officer and Mining Head investigates the situation and meets the feedback 

provider, where necessary. In FY 2018, we did not receive any grievance reports from the local communities.

We regard community empowerment as one of our main responsibilities. As our mines are located at the developing 

regions in Indonesia, we are presented with opportunities to meet the existing needs of local communities around us and 

helping them improve their standards of living. We respond to these opportunities by implementing various Corporate 

Social Responsibility (“CSR”) activities to meet the needs of local communities, where we seek to relentlessly strive in 

our endeavour of nation-building, sustainable development, accelerated inclusive growth and social equity through 

local community investment. We regularly engage the local community to understand their changing needs and design 

strategic CSR programmes that target these needs. Our ultimate aim is to help the local community attain self-sustaining 

financial independence and enhanced standard of living through partnership and environmental protection. Formal and 

information education to build the capacity of the local community, as well as skills upgrading programmes to develop the 

local economy, form the backbone of all our CSR efforts.

In line with Regulation no. 1824 (year 2018) about local community development as used by Indonesia’s ESDM, we aligned 

our CSR activities with the pillars of the CSR blueprint of the local governor. As a result, we managed to meet the standard 

for pillars such as education, health, real income/livelihood, socio-culture and infrastructure development in FY 2018, as 

shown in Table 3.

PROFILE OF OUR WORKFORCE

In FY 2018, we saw a 16% increase in our workforce, from 306 in FY 2017 to 355 in FY 2018, as a result of the increase of our 

production activities. These employees are mostly located in Indonesia, where BIB is located. In FY 2018, 24 out of our 355 

employees were located in Singapore, an increase from the 15 employees in the previous year.

71.5% of our employees were hired on a full-time basis with permanent contract in FY 2018, an increase from 68.6% in FY 

2017, enabling us to equip them with skillsets for their growth.

In FY 2018, there were 85 new hires and 37 turnovers.

While our gender breakdown indicates a higher proportion of male to female, this can be attributed to the fact that the 

nature of mining activities traditionally attracts more male workers over female workers. We have managed to maintain the 

percentage of female employees of 16% in FY 2018. Nevertheless, we will actively continue to promote gender diversity in 

our operations in the following years.

LOOKING AFTER OUR EMPLOYEES &amp; TALENT MANAGEMENT

At GEAR, we believe that creating a working environment where employees are appreciated and engaged is key to 

sustainable business. One of our core values is “Loyalty”, where we advocate a sense of fraternity and pride as members 

of our group. We are committed to looking after our employees’ welfare by offering competitive remuneration packages, 

medical insurance and other benefits.

We also care for our employees’ talent development because they are key to the company’s future growth. To this end, we 

provide various trainings to improve their technical skills (e.g. Coal Estimation Resource Workshop, Reporting Exploration 

Result and Estimation Coal Reserves Workshop, as well as Creative Accounting and Tax Planning Training), management 

skills (e.g. 1st and 2nd Mine Operational Supervisory), and safety awareness (e.g. Road to Safety Performance, Safety 

Convention).

In FY 2018, training hours in BIB increased to a total of 13,640 training hours for 217 participants, which consists of tradesman, 

staff, middle management and senior management. Our average training hours per employee is shown in Figures 43 to 45.

Coal Estimation Resource Workshop, and Reporting Exploration Result and Estimation Coal Reserves 

Workshop

In qualifying to be a Competent Person Indonesia (CPI) of the Kode Cadangan Mineral Indonesia (KCMI) under 

the Join Ore Reserve Committee (JORC), geologists and mine plan engineers are required to pass an exam for 

“CPI – KCMI for Estimation Resource” and “CPI – KCMI for Reporting Exploration Result and Estimation Coal 

Reserves”, respectively. To help geologists better prepare for the aforementioned certification exams, we have 

conducted workshops on Coal Estimation Resource to equip them with the necessary knowledge and skills to pass 

the examination. Similarly, for mine plan engineers, a workshop on Reporting Exploration Result and Estimation 

Coal Reserves was conducted. Upon passing the exam, the geologists and mine plan engineers have received 

the “CPI – KCMI for Estimation Resource” and “CPI – KCMI for Reporting Exploration Result and Estimation 

Coal Reserves” certification respectively from the Association of Indonesian Mining Professionals (PERHAPI) and 

Indonesian Association of Geologists (IAGI).

equip employees with the knowledge required in 

accounting business processes and tax planning. 



LABOUR RELATIONS MANAGEMENT

Being in a labour-intensive industry, we seek to develop good industrial relations at all times. This helps to create a 

conducive working environment, and prevents undesirable operation disruptions. Our workers are encouraged to 

communicate to their supervisors and/or HR Department on any issues that they face at an early stage, so as to arrive at 

a mutually acceptable solution. In the event that the issue remains unresolved, the issue will be escalated to the Industrial 

Relations team for further discussions until a mutually acceptable solution is reached.

In FY 2018, as a reflection of a fair grievance mechanism and the good industrial relations that we have built with our 

workers, there were zero cases of strikes and lockouts concerning BIB. BIB is in full compliance with the Indonesia labour 

laws, as concluded in annual audits conducted by the Ministry of Labour and Transmigration.

In event of any significant operational change that could substantially affect employees, there will be at least a 1-month 

notice period provided prior to the implementation of the change for us.
