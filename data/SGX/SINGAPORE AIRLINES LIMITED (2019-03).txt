This Sustainability Report aims to inform Singapore 

Airlines’ stakeholders of our sustainability performance in 

a transparent and accountable manner. It covers issues 

related to community, environment, governance and 

stakeholder engagement.

 

Through this report, we seek to identify opportunities to 

improve our sustainability management as well as issues 

that are integral to our business in order to address them 

effectively and appropriately. We endeavour to integrate 

sustainability throughout our customer experience and 

engagement process. Together with relevant partners 

within our value chain, we seek to explore ways to 

improve sustainable practices across all aspects of

our operations.

Overview

Reporting Period

SIA’s Sustainability Report is published annually in June. It covers the

Introduction




CEO's Message

As the urgency of climate change continues to grow, so is awareness of this all-

important issue. Singapore Airlines is very much aware that sustainability is about 

operating our business in a way that uses limited resources to meet our needs today, 

while ensuring that these resources will still be available to meet the needs of future generations.

SIA constantly seeks to develop as a corporate citizen, and ensures that our operations are carried out in a 

responsible manner. Our Board provides guidance and works with the Management Committee on the Group’s 

overall strategic direction, policies and business objectives. The topics that are material to us are detailed on 

page 12 of this report. 

In FY2017/18, we identified three Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the United Nations that are relevant 

to our sustainability strategy and the long-term targets that we aim to achieve in the future. These are:

 

u Goal 8: Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all

 

u Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns

 

u Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts

By aligning our business strategies to these SDGs, we embarked on many new initiatives in the last financial year 

to continue offering our customers the best travel experience while operating more sustainably.

We have significantly stepped up our in-flight sustainability initiatives to contribute to greener skies, by further 

reducing food wastage on board, cutting back on the use of in-flight items and increasing the use of sustainable 

ingredients for in-flight meals. We are harnessing technology and data analytics to better predict customers’ 

consumption patterns, for example, so as to further reduce cabin food waste. 

SIA also remains committed to reducing the use of single-use plastics by replacing them with alternative 

sustainable materials for more in-flight items. We aim to become entirely plastic straw-free this financial year. 

During the last financial year, we began the process of removing plastic straws on board, and the remaining, 

children’s straws, are to be substituted with environmentally-friendly paper straws by September 2019. 

We have also expanded our ‘From Farm to Plane’ concept, introduced in 2017, which promotes environmental 

sustainability and supports local farming communities. In FY2018/19, we embarked on an exciting new 

collaboration with AeroFarms, the world’s largest indoor vertical farm of its kind based in the United States, 

under which a customised blend of fresh produce will be supplied for SIA’s non-stop flights from New York 

(Newark Liberty International Airport) to Singapore from September 2019.

In line with efforts to constantly improve the travel experience for our customers, we have made significant 

investments in new products and new routes over the past year. This included the introduction of new regional 

cabin products on Boeing 787-10 and Airbus A350-900 medium-haul aircraft, as well as the launch in October 

2018 of the world’s longest commercial flights between Singapore and New York, using the world’s first Airbus 

A350-900ULR (ultra-long-range) aircraft. This was followed soon after by the launch of non-stop flights between 

Singapore and Los Angeles, and an increase in frequency on the Singapore-San Francisco route.

Our investment in new aircraft is in line with our longstanding practice of maintaining a modern and fuel-efficient 

fleet, enabling us to operate more efficiently and expand our network reach. We also continuously look out for 

opportunities and methods to reduce our carbon emissions to mitigate the impact of climate change. This is 

done through various fuel productivity and savings initiatives, which are outlined in the ‘Managing Environmental 

Impact’ section of this report, from pages 48 to 60.

Beyond our own operations, we have been the exclusive airline partner since 2010 for the Hutan Harapan 

Initiative, an ecosystem restoration concession covering nearly 100,000 hectares of tropical rainforest in 

Sumatra, Indonesia. This area is almost one-and-a-half times the size of Singapore and is rich in biodiversity.

While the initiative focuses on conservation efforts to sustain local development and protect wildlife biodiversity, 

more than 6,900 hectares of forest have been restored in Hutan Harapan since 2010. The team has been 

actively engaging the community in the Hutan Harapan area, which is home to about 9,500 people, on the 

importance of the protection of the rainforest. Conservation efforts have benefited about 1,430 members of 

the local population, whose livelihoods either depend on or impact the existence of the forest and its resources. 

To increase awareness about forest restoration, outdoor education camps have been set up, while plans are 

underway to expand a clinic to improve healthcare services. A notable development over the past year has 

been the engagement with communities on a 10-year agroforestry programme to further support community 

livelihoods. There has also been a steady and significant decline in illegal encroachment, illegal logging and forest 

fires over the years. The conservation of Hutan Harapan also ensures the protection of critically endangered 

animals, like the Sumatran tiger, where only 400-500 are left, and whose existence is threatened with the 

increased pace of deforestation and poaching. 

SIA’s contribution towards the protection and restoration of one of the most extensive tracts of lowland 

rainforests left in Indonesia reflects our strong belief that environmental efforts must focus on making a real and 

direct difference to the well-being of our planet, and sustain our shared environment for future generations.

We are also committed to acting ethically and with integrity to combat the risk of modern slavery and human 

trafficking. We have published a statement outlining our approach on this matter, and will continuously review 

and develop our policies and procedures to address modern slavery and human trafficking risks.

Following the integration of our low-cost airline subsidiaries Scoot and Tigerair under the Scoot brand in 

FY2017/18, we announced in May 2018 that SilkAir will undergo a major cabin product upgrade and ultimately be 

merged into SIA. These corporate developments will allow for greater synergies within the SIA Group, under our 

portfolio strategy in which we have investments in both full-service and low-cost airline operations.

Together with our subsidiaries, we are continuing to broaden our scope of reporting, and this will be further 

enhanced in the coming years. In this year’s report, we have outlined Scoot’s sustainability-related initiatives 

with regards to employees, for example, and will expand the scope further to include safety and environmental 

initiatives in the years ahead.

The airline industry has always been volatile, constantly challenged by economic forces and external events. 

Despite these challenges, we remain committed to our sustainability goals by raising awareness amongst our 

employees about the importance of being sustainable, as well as investing in new technologies and building on 

our digital capabilities to enhance our operations.

In January 2019, we formally launched KrisLab, our new digital innovation lab which serves as a collaborative 

workspace for our staff to develop innovative ideas, and co-innovate with external partners and start-ups to 

enable the SIA Group to fully embrace digitalisation and technology in all aspects of our business operations. 

Through KrisLab and our Digital Innovation Blueprint, SIA supports Singapore’s open innovation ecosystem to 

catalyse digital opportunities that enhance the country’s development as a travel and aviation hub in the region, 

with a key emphasis on nurturing digital aviation and travel technology start-ups, small and medium-sized 

enterprises, as well as broader communities of partners in adjacent industries.

In FY2019/20, we aim to take SIA’s sustainability practices to the next level, with many new initiatives that will 

build on our already strong position as a sustainable organisation. We look forward to sharing more of these 

sustainability initiatives in next year’s report.

SIA, together with partners, 

establishes Tiger Airways 

(which later operates as 

Tigerair), a Singapore-based 

no-frills airline offering 

affordable travel options.

On 28 June, SIA launches 

its inaugural non-stop flight 

from Singapore to New York 

using the ultra-long-range 

Airbus A340-500. The flight 

sets a new record for the 

world’s longest non-stop 

commercial flight.

On 1 May, a 

Malayan Airways 

Limited (MAL) 

Airspeed Consul 

takes off from 

Singapore’s 

Kallang Airport. 

It is the first of 

three flights a 

week to Kuala 

Lumpur, Ipoh and 

Penang.

MSA separates into two 

airlines: Malaysian Airline 

System and Singapore 

Airlines (SIA). The 

Singapore Girl is born, 

epitomising SIA’s tradition 

of friendly service and 

Asian hospitality in her 

distinctive batik sarong 

kebaya designed by 

Parisian couturier Pierre 

Balmain.

SIA launches the world’s first 

global sky telephone service, 

enabling passengers to stay 

in touch with people on the 

ground while they are in  

the air.

SIA is the first airline to 

provide audio- and video-on-

demand to passengers in all 

cabin classes with KrisWorld, 

its in-flight entertainment 

system.

2011

SIA announces plans to establish 

low-cost subsidiary airline Scoot, for 

medium and long-haul routes. Scoot 

begins its first flight to Sydney, 

Australia in 2012.

The giant pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia 

arrive in Singapore on 6 September, 

after flying in comfort on board a 

Singapore Airlines Cargo Boeing 747-400 

freighter from Chengdu, China. SIA 

becomes the Official Airline for the 

giant panda collaborative programme 

between Wildlife Reserves 

Singapore and the China 

Wildlife Conservation 

Association.

Malayan Airways Limited becomes 

Malaysian Airways Limited in 1963 and 

later, Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (MSA) 

in 1966.

SIA becomes the first airline to 

operate a commercial flight across 

the Pacific Ocean with the Boeing 

747-400, from San Francisco to 

Singapore via Hong Kong.

Tradewinds, a subsidiary of SIA, is 

announced as Singapore’s second 

airline. It has since become SilkAir, 

and grown its flight network to 

more than 45 destinations across 

Asia and Australia.

In September, SIA sets up the 

International Culinary Panel, 

comprising award-winning chefs 

from the world’s culinary capitals 

to take in-flight dining to new 

heights.

SIA makes history when it 

becomes the first to fly the 

Airbus A380, the world’s 

largest commercial aircraft. 

The next-generation aircraft 

will grow capacity on high 

demand routes, while 

delivering operational efficiency, 

environmental improvements 

and customer benefits.

SIA unveils its new Premium 

Economy Class seats and 

in-flight offerings after a two-year 

development programme.

SIA operates its first-ever Charity 

Flight on the Airbus A380. More 

than 300 beneficiaries were 

treated to a three-and-a-half-hour 

flight.

2019

Following the launch of its Digital 

Innovation Blueprint in 2018, SIA unveils 

its new digital innovation lab, KrisLab, 

as part of the SIA Group’s significant 

investment programme to become the 

world’s leading digital airline.

2018

SIA once again leads the aviation industry, becoming the first to fly the 

new Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner. The cabin, designed to be uplifting 

in every way, offers a more comfortable in-flight experience for 

customers. 

In May, SIA announces plans for SilkAir to undergo a significant 

investment programme to upgrade its cabin products as part of a 

multi-year initiative that will ultimately see it merged into SIA. 

SIA launches the world’s longest commercial flight between 

Singapore and New York in October, on the all-new Airbus 

A350-900 ultra-long-range aircraft.

SIA welcomes the latest-generation, 

highly fuel-efficient Airbus A350-900 

aircraft to its fleet in March, and 

later launches its new non-stop 

Singapore-San Francisco service 

using this aircraft.

Celebrating 70 years of excellence in 2017, SIA unveils its new cabin products which will be fitted to its Airbus 

A380 fleet following an extensive four-year development programme.

With the SIA Group emphasising the need to adapt nimbly and flexibly to industry changes so as to stay 

relevant in the competitive environment, Scoot and Tigerair merge under the Scoot brand name.

In partnership with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, SIA operates a series of 12 ‘green package’ 

flights over a three-month period from May on its non-stop San Francisco-Singapore route. It highlights SIA’s 

commitment to sustainable growth and to the reduction of international aviation emissions.

SIA launches its frequent flyer 

programme, KrisFlyer. The 

programme allows Singapore 

Airlines and SilkAir customers in 

all cabin classes to accumulate 

KrisFlyer miles and redeem tickets 

for travel.

Communication with Stakeholders

SIA undertakes timely and consistent disclosure of pertinent information 

to enable a transparent assessment of the Company's value.

The Company values dialogue with shareholders and holds analyst 

and media briefings when announcing half-yearly and full year results. 

Full transcripts of the proceedings are made available on SGXNet 

and SIA’s website at http://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/sg/about-us/

information-for-investors/ on the next working day.

All financial results, as well as price-sensitive information, are released in a 

timely manner through various platforms, including press releases posted 

on the Company’s website and disclosure via SGXNet. The Company’s 

website is an important source of information for shareholders and the 

investing community.

Quarterly results announcements, news releases, presentation slides, 

monthly operating statistics, annual reports, sustainability reports and 

other key facts and figures about the Company are available on the 

‘Information for Investors’ page. The Investor Relations department 

also meets analysts and investors on a regular basis through investor 

conferences and roadshows, post-results luncheons, as well as ad hoc 

meetings and teleconferences. A dedicated investor relations email address 

(investor_relations@singaporeair.com.sg) and hotline (+65 6541 4885) are 

maintained for the investing community to reach out to the Company for queries.

 

Risk Assessment and Management

The Board is responsible for the governance of the Company’s risks. 

Represented by the Board Safety and Risk Committee (BSRC), it ensures 

that Management maintains a sound system of risk management and 

reviews the effectiveness of the Risk Management Framework and Risk 

Management Process. The Committee convenes on a quarterly basis to 

review the robustness of the Company’s risk governance and reports key 

risks to the Board of Directors annually.

The Risk Management (RM) department initiates and coordinates 

activities to drive risk management efforts across the SIA Group. Aside 

from the BSRC, various Risk Management Committees, which comprise 

members from the Senior Management team, are set up at both the 

company and group levels to review risks and controls. They also ensure 

that risk management efforts are coordinated across business functions 

and the SIA Group respectively. 

To support the BSRC and other Risk Management Committees in 

reviewing the current risk environment and assessing the Company’s 

ability and readiness in addressing potential risks, RM department sees 

to it that pertinent issues are surfaced to the committees in a timely 

manner and works with the relevant business units and subsidiaries to 

put forth adequate information for review.  

RM department continually reviews and updates the SIA Group Risk 

Management policies to ensure practices remain relevant and effective. 

RM department monitors the application of risk management principles 

and processes by the Company through regular engagements with 

business units to review risks and controls on an ongoing basis and 

oversees the annual group-wide risk review exercise. 

The Risk Management Process involves the identification of new or 

emerging risks, and the evaluation of existing risks to determine their 

relevance in the current context. It also includes ensuring controls and 

processes are in place to manage economic, environmental and socio-

political risks. RM department also provides guidance for managing risks 

from both a top-down and bottom-up approach. This ensures that the 

needs and expectations of all stakeholders and corporate requirements 

are accounted for.

Other key initiatives under RM department include mandatory training 

for all staff through a web-based facility and managing a schedule 

to verify Business Continuity Plan tests on a regular basis. These 

initiatives are in place to ensure staff awareness and familiarity with 

risk management processes and requirements, and that alternate plans 

for various operational areas are adequate and effective. Updates on 

these activities are also reported to the BSRC and other relevant Risk 

Committees within the SIA Group.

Corporate Governance (Cont’d)

Ethics and Integrity

Singapore Airlines is committed to achieving high standards of corporate 

governance. Ethical business conduct is a significant guiding principle 

that we adopt in our worldwide operations. Our partnership with agents, 

contractors and employees is underpinned by their integrity in the 

conduct of their work, which is critical to our business operations 

and reputation.

Singapore Airlines has channels for employees, stakeholders and the 

public to raise concerns about possible improprieties in any matter, 

in confidence. The Company has a whistleblowing programme called 

‘Policy on Reporting Wrongdoing’ that is communicated to our employees 

through our internal Intranet, Staff Regulations and a mandatory web-

based training module. Employees, stakeholders and the public may report 

suspected matters of wrongdoing affecting the Company, either through 

email at ethics_hotline@singaporeair.com.sg or via telephone at +65 9387 5667.

The Audit Committee continuously reviews the whistleblowing programme 

to ensure that it is adequate. All whistleblowers' reports on suspected 

wrongdoings are reviewed by the Audit Committee at its quarterly 

meetings to ensure independent investigation and adequate resolution. 

There were no confirmed incidents of corruption involving our employees 

or business partners in FY2018/19. There were also no legal cases of 

corruption brought against the Company in the same financial year. 

Please refer to page 75 in the FY2018/19 Annual Report for more 

information on our whistleblowing programme.

Conflict of Interest

Singapore Airlines has a policy on conflict of interest which requires employees in a conflict 

of interest situation or in one which could potentially lead to a conflict of interest to report 

the matter to the Company. The policy requires all employees to make a declaration of all 

actual and potential conflict of interest situations to the Human Resources Division annually.

Anti-Corruption Training

Anti-corruption policies and procedures are communicated to Singapore Airlines employees 

via a web-based training module. The module includes information and assessments 

relating to the Company’s anti-corruption policy. Employees receive email notifications 

which prompt them to complete the web-based training. Business partners and service 

providers are required to sign contracts which include an anti-corruption and anti-bribery 

clause. Singapore Airlines’ Suppliers’ Code of Conduct is also included in the contracts. For 

more information on the Suppliers’ Code of Conduct, please refer to page 41 of this report.

Singapore Airlines targets to have at least 95 per cent of employees required to take the 

anti-corruption training complete it by the due date annually. The percentage excludes 

line pilots and cabin crew as they do not need to enter into transactions on behalf of the 

Company in the ordinary course of their work. Given the above, and the fact that their 

conduct is already governed under the staff regulations, they are not required to complete 

the anti-corruption training. 

In FY2018/19, 5,311 ground employees were required to complete the anti-corruption 

training. Of the 5,311 ground employees, 5,041 (94.9 per cent) of ground employees 

completed the anti-corruption training. Of all 5,311 ground employees, 407 are management*, 

of which 388 (95.3 per cent) completed the anti-corruption training.

Our Sustainability Organisational Structure

The Sustainability Strategic Working Committee (SSWC) spearheads SIA’s sustainability pursuits and is headed 

by Divisional Vice President Public Affairs. A cross-functional team within the SSWC, represented by department 

heads from various business units#, oversees company-wide sustainability strategies and initiatives. The SSWC

Materiality Assessment

The SSWC conducted a Materiality Assessment 

in 2013 by reflecting on significant economic, 

environmental and social impacts which are 

material to SIA. The process included evaluating 

feedback from various internal and external 

stakeholders, such as our employees and 

customers. As SIA’s Head Office is located in 

Singapore and a majority of our training  

facilities are based here, the topic boundaries 

are focused on our operations in Singapore,  

unless otherwise stated. 

The Materiality Assessment was last reviewed 

in 2017 and endorsed by SIA’s Management 

Committee and the Board. We strive to include 

our subsidiaries’ sustainable practices in our 

Sustainability Report progressively, so as to 

provide a more holistic picture of the SIA Group  

in terms of opportunities, risks and performance.

We reflected on 

significant economic, 

environmental and 

social impacts to 

determine which 

aspects are material 

to the organisation.

Stakeholder: Employees

Stakeholder Engagement Initiatives

Our Materiality Assessment process also enabled us to identify important 

stakeholders, whose input directly influences business decisions and 

operations. We define our stakeholders as groups whom our business has 

a significant impact on, and those with a vested interest in our operations. 

SIA has identified four key stakeholder groups, and engagement is done 

through written and digital communications, as well as face-to-face 

dialogues and briefings, among others. This allows for interaction with 

stakeholders to address key issues, feedback and concerns giving us the 

opportunity to improve our products, services and operational procedures.

The following tables provide examples of key engagement initiatives made 

by business units in the Sustainability Strategic Working Committee. These 

engagements were not conducted specifically for the Sustainability Report.

SIA’s safety governance structure consists of five groups to guide safety management:











Air Safety Committee (ASC)

The Air Safety Committee oversees the 

Safety Management System in SIA and 

ensures that systems and processes 

are effective, leading to safe operations 

both on the ground and in the air. The 

committee also monitors and reviews 

safety performance and trends, identifies 

safety risk areas and ensures that 

mitigating measures are effectively 

implemented to manage risks. ASC 

provides strategic direction to all 

Divisions’ Safety Action Groups.

Safety, Security and 

Environment (SSE) Division

The Safety, Security and Environment 

Division is the corporate safety office of 

SIA. It promulgates SIA’s safety policies 

and governance to meet regulatory 

requirements. SSE Division oversees the 

safety promotional and assurance activities 

across all the operations-related Divisions, 

and manages company-level flight safety 

risks. It also works closely with all Safety 

Action Groups to ensure an effective Safety 

Management System and continuous 

improvements in safety and quality 

standards in SIA.

Occupational Safety, Health and 

Environment (OSHE) Committee

The OSHE Committee tracks and reports 

on the safety and environmental 

performance of the SIA Group. After each 

quarterly meeting, any results, findings and 

updates are reported to SIA Management 

as well as the respective subsidiary heads. 

Representatives from the following 

departments and divisions make up the 

OSHE Committee: Airport Operations, 

Cabin Crew, Cargo, Engineering, Flight 

Operations, Inflight Services and 

Properties. Our subsidiaries SAGI, Scoot, 

SilkAir and SIA Engineering Company are 

also represented in the OSHE Committee.

Divisional Safety Departments / Safety Action Groups (SAG)

Each operations-related Division has a Divisional Safety team that reports directly to 

the Division’s Senior Vice President and is responsible for ensuring the effectiveness of 

the Division’s Safety Management System. A Safety Action Group is formed comprising 

representatives from other relevant departments in the Division to implement safety 

systems and processes. These include overseeing operational safety performance within 

the functional areas and ensuring that safety risk management activities, such as hazard 

identification, risk assessment and mitigation, are carried out. The Safety Action Groups 

also oversee safety assurance and promotional activities in the Division, and enable  

cross-learning and sharing of best practices for continuous improvement to sustain high 

levels of safety standards.

Board Safety and Risk 

Committee (BSRC)

The functions of the BSRC include 

ensuring that systems and programmes 

in the SIA Group comply with regulatory 

requirements and are in accordance 

with the best practices of the aviation 

industry, reviewing regular reports 

on safety performance, reviewing 

accident investigation findings and 

recommendations, as well as advising 

Management and reporting to the Board 

on safety issues. The BSRC also oversees 

the risk governance framework and risk 

management system, including reviewing key 

risks and controls put in place by Management.

Ground Ramp Incident Prevention (GRIP) Programme

The SIA GRIP Programme is currently in its 15th year. Regular ramp audits are conducted at all 

our stations to ensure ramp operations are carried out safely. Any unsafe practices or conditions 

observed are flagged up to the respective stations and departments. In 2018, over 1,500 

observations were made. These observations were followed up on and corrected accordingly.

Workplace Safety and Health

In order to continue strengthening Workplace Safety and Health awareness in the organisation, 

as well as meet Risk Management Regulations set by Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower, relevant 

staff were trained to carry out risk assessments at the workplace. The training focused on the 

fundamentals of hazard identification, risk prioritisation and mitigation through the application 

of risk management principles.

Flight Data Analysis Programme

Flight data is captured in our aircraft’s Quick Access Recorders (QAR). The data, which captures 

much of the aircraft’s flight and systems performance, is regularly downloaded from the QAR 

and analysed for irregularities so as to identify trends. Where necessary, corrective and/or 

preventive measures will be implemented to improve flying standards and enhance safety.

Safety Risk Management

Singapore Airlines operates in a highly unpredictable external environment. SIA’s robust Safety Risk 

Management policy guides the organisation in proactively identifying and managing safety risks and 

hazards. Measures are subsequently implemented to mitigate the risks to levels that are acceptable, 

aligned with corporate objectives.

Crew Resource Management

SIA carries out a company-wide online survey with air crew every two years. The safety survey 

assesses a number of areas such as safety management, training, equipment, violations observed 

during operations and readiness of crew to report safety occurrences or issues. It provides an 

overall assessment of the safety climate and culture in our operational environment, as well as 

safety concerns of crew.

We also have a comprehensive list of quantitative and qualitative performance indicators to 

measure the effectiveness of our efforts. These indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis and 

benchmarked against industry standards.

Employee Feedback

SIA endeavours to provide a safe work environment for all employees. We place emphasis 

on seeking employee feedback to improve safety standards in the workplace. Employees are 

encouraged to identify hazards and report flight and occupational safety incidents to create 

awareness and highlight risks.

Cabin Operation Safety

The safety of our customers and crew is a top priority in SIA. Determining the level of safety in our 

cabin operations is key to helping us understand the effectiveness of our safety procedures and to 

review our improvement plans. With the Cabin Safety Observations (CSO) programme where we 

can assess crews’ performance in their safety duties and responsibilities, we are able to adopt a 

systematic approach in upholding our standards of safety performance and commitment.

The observations from the CSOs, conducted by our qualified Inflight Auditors, provide real-time 

assessment on the safety competency of our cabin crew. Such information is collated and discussed 

with all stakeholders, including Cabin Crew Management and our cabin crew. Areas for development 

are then identified and worked on.

Safety and Security Week (SSW) 2018

The SSW was held from 17 to 21 September 2018 to promote safety and security awareness 

among staff in the SIA Group. The week-long event’s theme was “Safety Through Resilience”, 

which highlighted the importance for staff to respond effectively in unexpected situations. In 

addition, staff were made aware of the need to build resilience at all levels of our operations.

Staff who exhibited exemplary judgement and great skills in averting or handling a safety 

and security incident were presented with awards and citations during the ceremony.

Various divisions and business units within the SIA Group also organised programmes such as 

forums, seminars and campaigns to promote safety and security in their respective work areas. 

For example, the Engineering Division organised an Engineering Division Safety Week in 

September 2018. The week-long activities included Tea Time Talks, where a department 

representative presented various aspects of safety and security, and a Safe Riding Programme 

that focused on user and pedestrian issues. The week rounded off with a forum where 

Engineering staff had the opportunity to hear from professionals across the industry such as 

Airbus Singapore, Changi Airport Group (CAG), the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), 

and Transport Safety Investigation Bureau (TSIB) of Singapore.



Operational Safety

Recurrent Training

This programme is mandated by the regulators 

to ensure that aircraft systems and certain 

manoeuvres are completed in a three-year 

cycle. It is conducted twice a year in the full-

flight simulator. It seeks to enhance our 

pilots’ proficiency in handling abnormal and 

emergency situations.

In the world of automation, the Recurrent 

Training programme also allows our pilots to 

maintain their mastery in manual flight under 

different situations and environmental conditions.

SIA will be introducing Evidence-based Training 

(EBT) into our recurrent training programme 

for all pilots from 2020, to enhance the relevance 

of training delivered.

Safety and Emergency Procedures 

Training

This annual training refreshes pilots’ 

proficiency and knowledge, testing them in 

the areas of aircraft emergency procedures 

and cabin safety.

Crew Resource Management 

Refresher Training

This refresher course is conducted once every 

three years to revalidate pilots’ knowledge and 

application of non-technical skills.

SIA’s Safety Performance (Cont’d) 

Recency Training

This programme is conducted to requalify pilots who have not flown an aircraft for more than  35 days

Developmental Training

The Pilot Development Unit is a dedicated unit in the Flight Operations Training and Standards 

(FOTS) department, which oversees the training and development of SIA pilots, ranging from Cadet 

Pilots, Second Officers, First Officers to Captains and Instructors. This unit engages in-house trained 

instructors and facilitators, as well as external consultants with the aim of achieving the highest 

standards of developmental training.

As part of pilot development, the Pilot Mentoring programme further elevates our pilots to a higher 

level of competency and professionalism, reinforcing SIA’s core values. This programme plays a 

pivotal role in moulding our pilots, developing them through coaching and role modelling.

Ab Initio Pilot Training Conducted by Singapore Flying College

This programme enables cadet pilots to acquire the knowledge, skills and aptitude required 

to operate an aircraft safely, effectively and efficiently. Upon completion, cadet pilots will 

attain the qualification of the Multi-Crew Pilot Licence (MPL), which is the pre-requisite for 

further training and operations in an airline environment. This allows them to obtain their 

eventual qualification of the Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL).

Command Development and Upgrade Programme for First Officers

Command Development programmes are conducted in phases throughout First Officers’ 

careers to prepare them for the role of Captain. First Officers who meet the stringent 

requirements and high professional standards will be selected for a Command Upgrade 

and undergo a rigorous assessment programme before their promotion to Captain. 

Competency-based Training and Assessment (CBTA) Framework

SIA has embarked on a CBTA approach across its various training platforms. This includes 

the Multi-Crew Pilot Licence (MPL) Programme for Cadet Pilots, Second Officer Training, 

as well as the Command Development and Upgrade Programme for First Officers.

Conversion Training to Qualify Pilots for an Aircraft Rating

Pilots who fly different fleets as part of their career in SIA must attain additional qualification by 

undergoing a tailored course aligned to the aircraft manufacturer’s training programme.

Initial Crew Resource Management (CRM)

CRM training is integrated into the ab initio training programme. Besides satisfying regulatory 

requirements, the training is essential in building pilots’ non-technical skills, such as situational 

awareness, communication, leadership, teamwork and decision-making.

 

Initial Safety and Emergency Procedures (SEP)

To equip pilots with the knowledge and skills to manage safety-related and emergency 

situations, they are required to undergo a skills and scenario-based SEP training programme.

Second Officer Training to Qualify as First Officer

Upon completion of the ab initio programme, cadet pilots undergo enhancements to their basic knowledge 

and skills in a CBTA environment. This training is conducted in the full-flight simulator. Prior to being appointed 

as First Officers on the Airbus A330, A350, Boeing 737, 777 or 787, cadet pilots also undergo a structured 

Second Officer training programme to expose them to real life airline operations.

Other Training

Apart from training mandated by regulators, SIA conducts other forms of training for our pilots, which is deemed 

beneficial or necessary in enhancing their knowledge, skills and aptitude. This training takes into account their operating 

experience and recent events or incidents in the aviation industry as part of the Evidence and Event-based training 

programme. The Flight Operations Training and Standards department also actively participates in aviation training 

conferences and seminars conducted by industry organisations and aircraft manufacturers.

Collaboration with third parties is currently underway to study and leverage new technologies to further enhance the 

delivery of training. This will be progressively implemented in the following financial years.

Regular Checks

As part of the continual revalidation process, every pilot undergoes a minimum of three checks a year. These checks 

ensure that the pilot’s knowledge, manual flying skills and flight deck management skills are continuously practised, 

refreshed and tested. 

Base Checks are conducted bi-annually in the full-flight simulator. Pilots must demonstrate competency in manual 

flying under various conditions and be able to manage abnormal and emergency scenarios.

Line Checks are also conducted annually to ensure that the pilot’s knowledge and skills in operating a regular flight 

are in accordance with company policies and standard operating procedures. These checks continue throughout 

our pilots’ careers.

Performance Management System

The Integrated Crew Record and Appraisal System (ICRAS) is used to record all training, checks and assessments, in an 

electronic format. These assessment scores, in conjunction with other recorded performance markers, are used every 

half year to appraise candidates for promotional exercises.

SIA is also embarking on an enhanced training management system – Aircrew Competency Ecosystem. This system 

allows data to be gathered from all Competency-based Training and Assessment platforms so that they can be 

monitored, tracked and analysed to further enhance safety standards within the Company.

Fatigue Risk Management (FRM)

As with any hazard, SIA actively monitors fatigue issues of both our pilots and cabin crew. Crew rest facilities on our 

aircraft are regularly evaluated to ensure proper rest is available for crew on duty. The in-flight rest periods exceed 

mandatory requirements stipulated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS). SIA continuously monitors, 

evaluates and mitigates crew fatigue. We submit our reports to CAAS on a regular basis. 

All feedback from crew is considered in a tripartite manner, involving SIA’s Safety, Security and Environment Division, 

Flight Operations Division and the Air Line Pilots Association Singapore (ALPA-S). SIA is also an active member of the 

IATA Fatigue Management Task Force, which keeps abreast of the latest regulatory and industry developments in the area.

Aircraft Maintenance

Engineering Division’s pursuit of operational and technical excellence is fuelled by the strong correlation between safety and reliability. Our aircraft maintenance complies with the 

requirements regulated by CAAS, as well as the recommendations of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

While this focus on achieving high standards in aircraft maintenance remains a key objective, the drive towards a safe working environment for our staff and contractors is also a 

top priority. The standardising of behaviours and the incorporation of Safety Management System practices into airworthiness requirements by both CAAS and ICAO builds upon 

Engineering Division’s mission statement of ensuring our aircraft and cabin perform to the highest standards of safety, quality and reliability. For this reason, our Engineering 

Division has sought, attained and maintained accreditation by TUV SUD PSB Pte Ltd, a global testing, certification, inspection and training provider in the following aspects:

Passenger Safety

Safety is the primary concern of Singapore Airlines and all necessary measures are taken to ensure safe travel for our 

passengers and crew. A safety video is broadcast on all screens in the cabin prior to a flight departure. The purpose of 

the in-flight safety video is to increase our customers’ awareness on the appropriate safety measures to take during 

their flight in the unlikely event of an emergency.

SIA takes measures both on the ground and on board to minimise the spread of diseases. These measures include 

proactive screening of passengers by airport ground personnel to ensure the safety of passengers on board the flight. 

If any passenger appears to be unwell, he or she will be asked to see a doctor immediately. We will not carry any 

passenger whom we believe is a risk to others on board.

We have also developed a set of standard operating procedures to handle various medical emergencies, including 

infectious diseases. These measures will be coupled with the health regulations implemented by local authorities. 

For instance, our cabin crew are equipped with basic first aid training and knowledge to provide assistance to 

passengers who may be unwell on board our flights. Any unwell passenger will be attended to by the relevant 

medical authorities upon aircraft landing.

Our cabin crew are also enrolled in various safety and security courses, such as Safety and Emergency Procedures 

training and the Fatigue Risk Management programme. They are also trained in situational awareness, with an emphasis 

on workplace safety. Information on passenger safety is shared with cabin crew through videos, circulars, campaigns 

and regular communication sessions. The importance of balancing service with safety and security is also consistently 

emphasised through these channels. We target zero high severity incidents annually.

Food Safety

SIA is committed to serving in-flight meals that meet the highest level of food safety and hygiene. We have a policy 

of not using Monosodium Glutamate in the meals served to our customers. Our caterers ensure that ingredients 

are sourced from licenced and accredited establishments which conform to the requirements of relevant regulatory 

authorities, as well as the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) and International Organization for 

Standardization (ISO) systems. The Quality Assurance team from our local caterer, SATS Ltd, conducts factory audits 

on external suppliers, regular laboratory tests and random quality checks on incoming raw ingredients.

Locally-manufactured items are procured from establishments licenced by the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority 

of Singapore, or the equivalent authority in other countries. In addition to our caterers’ food safety compliance with 

their local regulations, SIA has engaged Medina Quality Assurance to conduct regular audits on SATS Ltd and selected 

overseas stations.

Globally, all caterers are certified by their relevant local authorities for food safety and hygiene. Caterers are required 

to comply with their local laws and regulations. They will advise SATS of such regulations during the development of 

meals, so that the meals prepared are in line with local regulations. Health and safety impact assessments are 

evaluated through the following:

 

u Invitations to tender to suppliers have to comply with local legislation and regulatory requirements

Stakeholder Engagement: Customers 



Customer Service and Engagement

For Singapore Airlines, customer service is intrinsically 

linked to our brand promise. Whether pre-flight, on board 

or post-flight, we continue to place emphasis on the 

quality of service that our customers receive across all 

Singapore Airlines touchpoints. We also actively listen to 

our customers through verbal and written feedback, 

focus groups and surveys. 

Increasingly, social media has become an important channel through 

which we engage with our customers, communicate important travel 

information and obtain feedback from them daily. Since September 2014, 

a dedicated Social Media Engagement Unit has been in place 24 hours 

a day, seven days a week to provide quick responses to feedback from 

customers and real-time service recovery on our social media channels.

SIA has Facebook pages in seven different languages, including English, 

French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Spanish and Turkish, to better reach 

out to customers in different regions. These platforms serve as additional 

contact points for greater online customer engagement. The Weibo accounts 

for both Singapore Airlines and SilkAir were merged in 2017 to enable 

seamless communication with our customers in China.

Singapore Airlines’ Customer Affairs (CA) department attends to customer 

feedback and enquiries, with a target response time of 10 working days. 

Where necessary, investigations are carried out prior to any given response. 

Where required, appropriate service recovery is taken to resolve service 

lapses, address customer concerns and restore confidence in the SIA 

brand promise. In line with SIA’s pursuit of excellence, CA department 

regularly shares trends and insights from case investigations with the 

relevant business units. These business units will take such information 

into consideration as they regularly review the Airline’s service and 

product offerings, as well as operational procedures.

CA department also employs data analytics to enhance feedback handling 

and interaction with customers, including better case prioritisation to 

more effectively address customers’ concerns. A case management system 

is used to track case assignments and closures. Feedback management 

reports are prepared regularly to monitor the achieved response rates. 

To track customer satisfaction, CA department monitors the number 

of replies received from customers, as this reflects whether customers’ 

concerns have been adequately addressed.

CA department aims to further use analytics to identify pertinent issues 

more accurately and efficiently, so that the relevant departments can 

better anticipate customer needs for servicing. In the next three years, 

CA department also aims to leverage technology to issue electronic 

service recovery vouchers. This will not only enable customers to use the 

vouchers in a more flexible manner, but also allow them to monitor the 

vouchers’ validity easily. Currently, paper-based service recovery vouchers 

are issued and tracked manually.

To continually improve customer servicing, CA department prepares 

a monthly Service Quality Performance report on compliments and 

complaints received, to enable business units to track and refine their 

service performance. The Service Quality Committee and the In-Cabin 

Experience Steering Committee, chaired by Senior Vice President 

Customer Services and Operations, and Senior Vice President Customer 

Experience respectively, meet bi-monthly to review customer trends 

and anticipate customer needs. The committees closely monitor the 

end-to-end customer experience and formulate strategies to achieve 

service improvement to elevate SIA’s overall service standards.

Stakeholder Engagement: Customers (Cont’d)

Singapore Airlines’ subsidiary airlines, SilkAir and Scoot, also remain committed to providing excellent service for their customers. 



SilkAir continuously improves its service standards by monitoring feedback and 

customer sentiment through customer satisfaction surveys. To keep up with the 

changing customer landscape, SilkAir also engages with its customers via various 

social media channels. In addition, SilkAir is collaborating with Singapore Airlines 

to launch an online survey to collect customer feedback after flights in FY2019/20. 

With this online survey, customer feedback can be obtained in real time, enabling 

better accuracy in assessing customers' preferences and better identifying areas for 

improvement. 



Scoot established a dedicated Customer Service department in July 2018 to focus 

on managing call centre operations and overseeing customer-related policies and 

procedures. In addition, an in-house social media customer servicing team monitors 

Scoot’s Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts to better facilitate communication 

of time-sensitive travel information, and provide quick response and instantaneous 

service recovery for customers. A case management system is in place to track individual 

case assignments and closures from all customer servicing channels managed by 

Scoot’s Customer Service department. Management reports are also prepared 

regularly to monitor the respective service levels.



Enhancing Customer Experience

To transform the SIA customer experience through the delivery of personalised service and engagement at every touchpoint, 

the Customer Experience (CE) department adopted a human-centred design methodology and created a set of experience design 

tools in 2018. This underlined a shift in mindset, from an inside-out (business-driven) to an outside-in (customer-led) approach. 

This change in mindset allowed SIA to work on improving areas that are most impactful to customers, driving continued 

satisfaction, loyalty and advocacy.

The CE department also used a three-stage design thinking process of Discover, Design and Deliver to better understand 

customers and their needs, so that improvements in services could be designed in a way that allowed the respective business 

units to deliver them seamlessly. This included working with the various business units using both qualitative and quantitative 

research to identify customer needs, value drivers, personas, behaviours, pain points, as well as business gaps and opportunities 

across all SIA touchpoints. The CE department aims to leverage customer data and insights to consistently deliver the “Right 

product and Right service to the Right person at the Right time with the Right price using the Right channel”. 

For example, the CE department took on a ‘customer first’ mindset when designing the in-flight experience of the world’s longest 

non-stop flight between Singapore and New York launched in October 2018. Surveys were conducted to understand customers’ 

in-flight experience and find out what they value on board a long-haul flight. In-depth qualitative interviews were also conducted 

with customers to better understand their motivations and desires when travelling long haul. These culminated in the ‘Wellness 

Programme’, which focuses on wellness cuisines, rest and relaxation, general well-being of our customers, as well as a customised 

dining service tweaked to suit their needs on long-haul flights. Each initiative that was implemented is monitored and tracked 

for continuous improvement. 

Singapore Airlines’ subsidiary, Scoot, strives to further leverage technology and automation to enhance existing disruption 

management communications with affected customers to reduce inconvenience. Customers are encouraged to take up self-

help options that are available online, such as changing of their flight schedules. Additional self-help options such as change 

notifications as well as ad-hoc disruption notifications will also be made available online in future. 

In July 2018, Scoot launched its Net Promoter Score (NPS) post-flight customer survey to measure customer satisfaction and 

advocacy. Customers provided feedback on how well Scoot understood and met their needs, and surfaced pertinent issues and 

concerns which the respective business units looked into. As of February 2019, there was a 70 per cent improvement in the NPS 

since the survey was launched.

With the introduction of the Automated Bag Drop (ABD) machines in July 2018, more than 50 per cent of Scoot’s customers 

departing from Singapore Changi Airport have opted for self-service check-in. Check-in operations are monitored daily and the 

average clearance time for customers departing Singapore Changi Airport has improved by 18 per cent as of February 2019.

Scoot also introduced Asia Pacific’s first airline transactional chatbot in July 2018 known as M.A.R.V.I.E. (Most Awesome 

Resourceful Virtual Intern Ever). The chatbot has the ability to handle customers’ queries, help search for flights, display fares 

and availability, make and manage bookings, and allow payment by credit card – essentially completing a full ticket sale. From 

handling just 50 queries a day with a resolution rate of 37.5 per cent, M.A.R.V.I.E. is now able to handle an average of 2,500 

unique users and 10,000 interactions per week, with a resolution rate of 79.3 per cent.

SOAR as ONE

SOAR as ONE

In a rapidly evolving airline industry, customer service across all touchpoints remains at the core of Singapore Airlines’ brand promise. To strengthen 

SIA’s service culture, SOAR as ONE was introduced in May 2017 as the Airline’s guiding service philosophy. It underlines a commitment to service 

excellence throughout the SIA Group and among service partners under a single, unified call to action.

With SOAR as ONE, frontliners are better able to appreciate and understand their roles in the SIA service chain and their impact on the overall 

customer experience. This allows SIA to reinforce a service culture that engenders consistently high service delivery standards across all 

customer touchpoints.

Other than service beliefs and standards, structured service training programmes, service audits and performance metrics, SIA is committed to the 

importance of service recognition schemes to help drive a strong service culture. The annual CEO Service Excellence Awards pay tribute to exemplary 

individuals and teams for outstanding service, encouraging frontliners to uphold SIA’s reputation of service excellence.

SIA’s Corporate Learning Centre (CLC) conducts SOAR as ONE training for frontline staff based in Singapore, including service partners from SATS and 

call centres. Cabin crew also get to participate in the course. Separately, CLC conducts Train-the-Trainers sessions for overseas stations. In FY2018/19, 

83 per cent of Singapore-based staff and 83 per cent of overseas-based staff completed the training.  

The SilkAir Customer Affairs team also conducted SOAR as ONE training for its operational units and overseas stations across the SilkAir network. 

Through this course, staff are equipped with a better understanding of customer expectations at each touchpoint. In FY2018/19, 100 per cent of all 

Singapore-based SilkAir staff and 97.4 per cent of all overseas staff completed the SOAR as ONE training. Upon completion of the course, frontliners 

are empowered to deliver excellent customer service and become service ambassadors of SilkAir.

Customer Satisfaction

In our journey to uphold service excellence, our Customer Contact Services (CCS) department regularly collates and monitors customer feedback 

across various customer servicing channels such as calls, emails and web chats. Feedback is reviewed regularly with the relevant business units 

to identify opportunities to improve the customer experience.

Customer Privacy

Customer privacy is important to SIA. Any customer personal data that is collected or accessed when servicing customers’ reservation and ticketing 

matters is handled strictly according to the guidelines laid out by the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) of Singapore, General Data Protection 

Regulation (GDPR) and SIA’s Privacy Policy. Regular service audits are conducted to ensure that our customer service representatives comply with 

our customer data protection policies.

To balance customer experience and customer data protection, our verification processes are regularly reviewed and enhanced based on customer 

feedback and consultation with the Legal department to ensure strict compliance with customer data protection regulations.

The Customer Affairs department also abides strictly by SIA’s Privacy Policy. Customer data, such as personal particulars and travel history, which 

is accessed while handling feedback, is treated as strictly confidential. Complaints, queries, withdrawal of consent, requests for access, corrections 

and updates in relation to personal data are handled according to established internal organisational processes. These processes were developed in 

consultation with the Legal department to ensure strict compliance with the PDPA. This compliance thus cultivates confidence among customers who 

entrust the Airline with their personal data, facilitating the provision of a safe, smooth, efficient and customised experience.

Industrial Relations 

Singapore Airlines has a close working relationship with the Air-Transport Executive Staff Union (AESU), Air Line Pilots Association Singapore (ALPA-S), 

and Singapore Airlines Staff Union (SIASU) to put in place sustainable terms and conditions of service, which are encapsulated within the respective 

Collective Agreements. Progressive wage increments benchmarked against company performance, productivity growth and market conditions are 

also discussed with our unions annually. Approximately 98 per cent of SIA employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. 

A collaborative partnership approach is adopted in our engagements with the unions. Management and union leaders meet monthly to address 

matters pertaining to the workforce and share updates on company initiatives. New initiatives aimed at developing our employees’ careers and 

competencies, as well as driving performance and productivity are also explored during these forums. 

In FY2018/19, Singapore Airlines successfully concluded the profit-sharing bonus agreement with its three unions, annual service increment 

agreements with ALPA-S and SIASU, as well as the 2019 Collective Agreement with SIASU.

SIA’s Chairman and Senior Management have quarterly lunch meetings with union leaders to share the Company’s business outlook and discuss 

workforce matters. Union leaders are also invited to company functions such as retirement and long service award ceremonies, as well as SIA’s 

Business Meetings, among others. Union-Management retreats are also organised for both parties to discuss longer-term strategic workforce initiatives.

Employee Health and Wellness

The health and well-being of our employees are important to Singapore Airlines, and crucial to the success  

of the Company. To promote general wellness and a healthy lifestyle, Singapore Airlines conducted several 

activities under the SIA Wellness &amp; Health Programme for employees in FY2018/19:

 

Employee Code of Conduct

All Singapore Airlines employees are expected to adhere to the staff regulations published on our corporate 

Intranet. These staff regulations cover aspects such as anti-corruption, competition law, conduct, discipline, 

harassment, non-discrimination and personal data protection policies. Any staff found not to have complied  

with the regulations will be subject to disciplinary proceedings. 

We have an established Disciplinary Inquiry Process to handle cases of misconduct in the event an employee 

violates the staff regulations. Such proceedings are recorded and a summary report of each inquiry is submitted 

to Senior Management.

The Company’s staff regulations are also reviewed regularly by the Human Resources and Legal departments to 

ensure relevance. Changes are communicated to all staff in a timely manner for compliance. 

Grievance mechanisms are also detailed in our Collective Agreements. The number of grievances to third parties, 

if any, are captured annually and reported in Singapore Airlines’ Sustainability Report.

Labour practices relating to child labour, forced or compulsory labour, human rights grievance mechanism,  

as well as diversity and equal opportunity are in accordance with the Ministry of Manpower’s Employment Act.

Performance and Productivity

SIA Leadership Competency Framework

Singapore Airlines’ Leadership Competency Framework outlines key 

behavioural and leadership competencies required of an SIA leader.  

To ensure the competencies continue to be aligned with the 

organisation’s core values and objectives, the Leadership Competency 

Framework was further revamped and streamlined for relevance in 

FY2018/19. This enhancement allows for greater differentiation in 

the behavioural and leadership attributes of SIA staff across different 

levels, and also allows staff to have greater focus and understanding of 

each leadership competency. The revamped Leadership Competency 

Framework has been communicated to staff and is implemented in our 

performance assessments from FY2018/19.

Performance Development and Talent Management via

an Integrated Talent Management Suite (myTMS)

Since its introduction in April 2017 to all SIA employees, our performance 

management system allows employees to have a greater overview of 

their own performance, and understand the impact of their achieved 

targets on the Company’s overarching objectives. With this in mind, 

employees can take ownership of their own career development in the 

Company and initiate self-development. 

The performance management system also serves as a platform to 

enable employees to provide feedback to anyone at any time. The 

feedback function has been integrated into 1SQ, our employee mobile 

app, since August 2018. This gives employees another avenue to share 

feedback with their peers.

With a fully integrated performance management system, we can make 

use of the system’s analytical tools to strategically manage and develop a 

strong talent pool globally.

Employee Engagement

Singapore Airlines engages its employees through communications via 

the following channels: internal platforms, events, wellness and health 

activities, community service as well as social functions. Regular surveys 

are also conducted to measure employee engagement levels.

Staff are encouraged to join quarterly chill out sessions with SIA’s CEO 

(for all staff) and HR forums (for managerial grade staff) to discuss 

matters pertaining to the Company.

1SQ, Singapore Airlines’ first-ever employee app, was launched in February 

2018. The app allows staff on-the-go access to the latest Company news 

and corporate deals, as well as the ability to perform self-service functions 

such as submit leave or travel requests conveniently, any time, anywhere. 

The launch of the 1SQ app was an important step in our journey towards 

creating a consumer-grade and employee experience-based app within 

the organisation. It also enables our workforce digitally. New features will 

be added in design sprints, adopting an agile methodology. As of 31 March 

2019, over 85 per cent of employees in Singapore use the 1SQ app.

Community Service

Our employees continue to give back to the community passionately 

through group visits to homes, outings with beneficiaries and fundraising 

initiatives throughout the financial year. Staff also showed the spirit of 

giving during festive periods such as the Lunar New Year, where they 

participated in the annual Community Chest Fu Dai event in 2019. Staff 

volunteers helped to pack and deliver bags of festive goodies to spread joy 

to the less fortunate during the festive season.

Learning and Development

Under the ambit of SIA’s Transformation journey, Singapore Airlines strives 

to inspire passion in our people by providing opportunities for personal 

growth. To this end, we regard the development of our employees as a 

key differentiator in order to remain competitive.

Significant resources are invested to develop our employees globally. 

In FY2018/19, we invested a total of $37.1 million in learning and 

development, which includes a $1.5 million grant from SkillsFuture 

Singapore. Each employee underwent an average of 4.2 days of 

training during the financial year in review. 

Ground Staff Training

Singapore Airlines introduced a refreshed role-based approach for sales 

training that incorporates the use of tools and soft selling skills to support 

the global roll-out of the ‘Sales Force Effectiveness’ programme. The 

training equips sales managers with a Sales Cadence framework to coach 

and develop their sales personnel. This allows our global sales teams 

to have a more structured end-to-end approach towards developing  their 

accounts.

A new customer service training programme, SOAR as ONE, enables 

employees to understand their customers better. By identifying customers’ 

perceptions at various touchpoints across the SIA journey, both frontline 

staff and back-office teams gain greater awareness of customers’ end-to end 

journeys, and understand how decisions made at each touchpoint could impact 

the customer experience. Staff are also guided through an ideation process 

to create and enable memorable experiences for customers.

In January 2019, a ‘Learning &amp; Innovation for Everyone’ (LIFE) event was 

organised in conjunction with the launch of KrisLab, Singapore Airlines’ 

digital innovation lab. Over 1,300 employees across the SIA Group attended 

the three-day learning event, which focused on imparting future-economy 

skills to staff such as innovation with design thinking, agile methodologies 

and data analytics. In addition, staff were exposed to new technologies

Heeding a call by the Ministry of Defence, SIA encouraged servicemen and 

women to wear their uniforms to work on 2 July 2018 in celebration of 

Singapore Armed Forces Day. Staff were also encouraged to tag photos 

of themselves in military uniforms, or with National Service (NS) 

Men colleagues, on social media with the hashtags #SAFDay and 

#WeSupportYouinNS. In FY2018/19, a total of 96,118 hours of reservist 

time off was granted to male employees.

Singapore Airlines’ staff lounge at Airline House, 7Degrees, has been well 

received by employees. It provides them with an inviting space to unwind 

and network. The lounge also serves as an alternate venue to hot desk, as 

well as to hold meetings and social functions.

Regular fleet meetings and dialogues with Senior Vice President Flight 

Operations are held to brief pilots on fleet and Company matters. 

Operations, training and safety issues are also shared with pilots at 

briefings and annual symposiums. A variety of online platforms such as 

e-newsletters, message boards, circulars and an internal social media 

channel are also used for communications on fleet and Company matters. 

To foster better camaraderie, teamwork and understanding amongst 

pilots and ground staff, Flight Operations Division also plans divisional 

social events and charity activities throughout the year.

Cabin crew are engaged via social media, web-based applications, as well 

as face-to-face dialogues. Held monthly, each session will see up to 70 

crew participants who discuss and receive updates on matters pertaining 

to the Company or their duties. To reach out to more crew members, 

informal gatherings with Ward Management Leaders are held regularly at 

the Cabin Crew vControl Centre.

Cabin Crew and Pilots

Crew Welfare

Singapore Airlines ensures that our flying crew have sufficient rest time during layovers and after flights. In 

addition to rest days, cabin crew and pilots are given in-flight rest on longer flights. The in-flight rest periods 

exceed mandatory requirements stipulated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. Singapore Airlines 

also regularly shares information on fatigue risk management to encourage our flying crew to have adequate 

rest before they report for their flight duties. Regular communication with our flying crew allows the Company 

to share tips and recommendations on fatigue management. To facilitate this, Singapore Airlines is currently 

exploring the development of a fatigue management app for flying crew.

Extracurricular Activities (ECA)

The Cabin Crew Division encourages staff to pursue their interests through a variety of ECA clubs. Like-minded 

individuals bond over activities such as sports, art and culture appreciation, and community service. Apart from 

striving towards the physical wellness of staff, some ECA clubs also serve the purpose of refining knowledge that 

is applicable to in-flight service. ECA clubs go through a biennial sustainability review to ensure that they remain 

inclusive and beneficial to employees of the Cabin Crew Division. ECAs are given the platform to reach out to all 

crew through various communication channels, club events and initiatives such as recruitment drives and inter-ward 

challenges. This allows SIA to work cohesively towards our goal of higher staff participation and engagement.

Returning Crew Scheme

Safety is paramount to Singapore Airlines. As such, pregnant crew are not permitted to carry out duties on 

flights. Under the Returning Crew Scheme, crew are encouraged to return to flying duties after delivering their 

child. After meeting a pre-set list of criteria under this scheme, cabin crew can return to their flying duties with 

minimum disruption to their careers, with their previous years of service retained. 

Each year, SIA holds bi-annual talks conducted by healthcare professionals for crew who left due to their pregnancy, 

to raise awareness of the scheme. In addition, SIA seeks to encourage and assist them to return to flying duties 

with these talks. There was a 13 per cent increase in the number of successful applications for the scheme in 

FY2018/19. We target to achieve a 100 per cent increase in the number of applications by FY2023/24.

This initiative is reviewed at divisional level meetings, which take place on a quarterly basis. The progress  

of the initiative is assessed and appropriate action plans are implemented to ensure targets are met by the  

set timelines.

Career Transition Programme

For crew who wish to continue working beyond retirement, a Career Transition Guide and list of career opportunities 

are shared with them six months before retirement. Potential employers will be informed to get in touch with 

retiring crew. Financial management courses are also available to assist crew in making sound financial decisions 

in preparation for retirement.

Digitisation of Crew Reports and Resources

Our cabin crew are provided with tablets to help digitise onboard work processes and to assist them in delivering 

better service to our customers. Singapore Airlines’ digital drive has led to greater efficiencies as well as an 

improvement in environmental sustainability. Digital reports have resulted in a significant reduction in paper 

consumption. Crew also have access to digital manuals and forms, while the Crew App contains features that 

allow them to access flight information and rosters on-the-go. This has significantly reduced the need to print  

in-flight resources and rosters. To further enhance efficiency, a dashboard is being developed to reduce 

manpower requirements in data analysis by providing a platform that allows real-time data flow.

Project World At Your Fingertips (W@YF) was implemented in December 2017 to harness the use of technology 

and mobility to increase the timeliness of operational information transmission to pilots. All pilots were issued 

iPads in a bid to go paperless. Pilots are now able to access applications such as enhanced weather awareness 

(eWAS), a centralised and tailored document repository (Aerodocs), as well as airport navigation and terminal 

charts (Jeppesen FD Professional) via iPads.

Harnessing Technology for Training

SIA’s Cabin Crew Learning &amp; Development department has implemented a series of initiatives to facilitate  

a better learning experience using technology. Besides the digitisation of course materials and handouts,  

newly-trained crew will have their performance assessed and recorded digitally through an app during  

on-the-job training. This improves the user experience for the assessor, as well as the timeliness of tracking  

the progress of crew.

An automated attendance tracking system was implemented in FY2018/19 as part of SIA’s efforts to simplify 

training processes through digital automation. This initiative enables crew to mark their attendance for classes 

simply by tapping their staff identification cards on readers available in the classroom.

Cabin Crew Learning and Development

Before they can perform their flight duties on board, new cabin crew members 

must complete classroom and on-the-job training. This 14-week basic training 

programme covers topics such as food knowledge, meal service procedures, 

personal grooming, social etiquette and wine appreciation.

To ensure that learning remains relevant and engaging for our new 

generation of crew, the programme was recently revamped. It now adopts 

a simulated flight phase training approach to enable new crew to retain 

knowledge and apply it effectively on board. The revamped curriculum 

also provides new crew with more hands-on opportunities to continuously 

reinforce their learning. At the same time, it heightens their level of 

spontaneity and situational awareness.

Cabin crew are also taught passenger handling skills, which include 

techniques to deliver service excellence to young children, the elderly 

and mobility-challenged individuals. They are also equipped with 

communication skills to better understand and meet the needs of a wide 

range of customers. In line with Singapore Airlines’ focus on safety and 

security, our crew also undergo training in security, safety and first aid 

procedures. This includes learning cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) 

during their basic training programme.

Beyond functional skills required for cabin crew to carry out their duties 

on board, opportunities for self-development are provided through our 

Self-Directed Learning programme. A wide range of courses such as 

culinary arts, languages, people management, as well as training and 

leadership are offered. This empowers our crew to take control of their 

developmental needs and complements their core skillsets with selected 

certified professional competencies.

Pilot Training

Singapore Airlines designs and conducts training programmes for our pilots 

to achieve the highest standard of training that meets all regulatory 

requirements and our Company’s training objectives.

Other than mandatory training programmes, development programmes 

are conducted for all ranks of staff to enhance their operational competencies 

and flying skills.

In addition, a mentoring framework is put in place to facilitate our pilots’ 

competency and professionalism, and instil the Company’s core values 

in them. More details on our flight operations training can be found on 

page 23 of this report.

Other Forms of Training

Air Sommelier Scheme

To provide professional wine services to our customers, suitable crew are identified and trained under the Air Sommelier Scheme to be sommeliers 

on board our flights. 

To be eligible for the Air Sommelier Scheme, cabin crew must attain the globally-recognised Wine and Spirit Education Trust’s (WSET) Level 3 Award 

in Wines Certification. In addition, crew are required to attend a six-month in-house programme with training workshops, periodic assessments and 

assignments before they earn an Air Sommelier badge on their uniform.

All Air Sommeliers are expected to strengthen their tasting skills and wine knowledge regularly. This is achieved through obtaining professional 

certifications, as well as attending tasting sessions and seminars by wine experts. To ensure that they stay abreast of trends and maintain adequate 

knowledge and skills, all Air Sommeliers are required to sit for an annual proficiency assessment.

Foreign Language Scheme

Singapore Airlines offers two foreign language schemes to our cabin crew, namely French Language and German Language schemes.

Cabin crew selected for these schemes will undergo an intensive eight-week course at established language institutes to immerse themselves into 

the language and culture. Course graduates thus possess the level of proficiency required to attend to the needs of our French or German-speaking 

customers. 

Crew members under this scheme will don a name tag bearing the French or German flag, and operate on specific flight sectors where their language 

skills are required. They also undergo annual refresher training and have their language proficiency assessed at least once a year.

Stakeholder Engagement: Employees (Cont’d) 

Partnership with SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG)

As an In-house Approved Training Organisation supported by SSG, Singapore Airlines offers many Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) accredited 

courses for our cabin crew. Nationally-recognised Statements of Attainment are issued to all participants who successfully complete the course and 

pass the assessment. Crew who graduate from the initial Cabin Crew Readiness Programme (CCRP) will achieve a nationally-recognised certification 

under the WSQ Service Excellence framework.

Building on the accreditation of the CCRP, Singapore Airlines’ Cabin Crew Leaders Programme (CCLP) was accredited with the Advanced Certificate 

in Service Excellence under the nationally-recognised WSQ Service Excellence Competency Framework in 2017. This accreditation ensures that SIA’s 

training programme is benchmarked against national standards, and reaffirms SIA’s commitment and ability to continue attracting the best talent 

and support to grow the Company.

Employee Engagement in SilkAir

At SilkAir, new hires undergo an induction programme, which introduces them to the aviation industry and the organisation culture. New executives 

participate in a mentorship scheme to learn from other senior executives and managers. Other than offering training for ground staff through SIA’s 

Corporate Learning Centre, SilkAir also has Continuing Education opportunities, which provide sponsorships to employees to further their studies or 

upgrade their skillsets.

Employee Engagement in Scoot

Townhall sessions with all Scoot employees are held every quarter and 

hosted by Scoot’s CEO to update employees on company news and 

upcoming projects, as well as address any questions that employees may 

have. The townhall sessions are available via live streaming to employees 

overseas, and a video of it is also available for viewing after the event. 

As part of Scoot’s culture of openness, staff are encouraged to pose 

questions to their CEO via a pre-townhall poll. Employees can submit 

questions in advance online, and a ‘live’ anonymous Question &amp; Answer 

segment will be conducted during the townhall session. 

Scoot also organises various staff engagement initiatives throughout 

the year to encourage staff engagement and inclusivity. These include 

free onsite health screening, movie nights and office parties to celebrate 

company milestones and festivals, as well as sports activities, among others.

Regular discussion sessions for Scoot’s cabin crew and pilots are also held 

throughout the financial year in review, where crew can pose questions to 

their management. 

More information on Scoot’s employee engagement initiatives can be 

found on page 14 of this report. 

Employee Experience Survey

In December 2018, Scoot engaged Qualtrics, an experienced management 

company, to conduct its yearly Scoot Employee Experience survey to 

measure overall engagement scores and to better understand the staff’s 

work experience. Feedback and insights from the survey have helped 

Scoot to promptly identify issues, allowing the customisation of action 

plans to address these gaps. Findings from the survey were shared 

with employees within three months. Scoot intends to continue using 

the Qualtrics platform in future to measure recruitment candidate and 

employee lifecycles at more frequent intervals.

Online Team Collaboration Platform

Scoot believes in cultivating an empowering work environment for its 

employees, to inspire innovation, drive collaboration and foster safety. 

Scoot’s online team collaborative platform, Workplace, helps to ensure 

that the company can grow while maintaining agility, transparency and 

openness. As of March 2019, Workplace has a 98 per cent adoption rate, 

and over 95 per cent average weekly users. Workplace’s features enable 

Scoot’s Human Resources Helpdesk to answer questions and share updates 

with all Scoot staff. With the deployment of Prepp Bot, a smart chatbot, 

Scoot is able to broadcast urgent messages to all employees via the 

chat function. Read rates can be monitored, which allows the internal 

communications team to customise action plans if read rates are low.

Through the use of Workplace, the number of email correspondences 

within the company has declined significantly, and helped to increase 

engagement with employees.

Staff Suggestion Platform

In January 2019, Scoot launched its Staff Suggestion Platform for 

employees to submit ideas to improve company processes.

Training and Educational Programmes

Scoot is committed to cultivating a collaborative and inclusive workplace 

that provides equal opportunities for employees to learn and develop 

their professional skills. A diverse range of training and educational 

programmes have been identified to help Scoot employees grow 

professionally and remain relevant in the industry. Launched in January 

2019, Scoot’s in-house training curriculum focuses on three main pillars of 

development: personal effectiveness, technical skills and functional skills. 

It comprises externally-sourced training courses targeted at different 

employee groups. Employees can also self-source relevant training 

programmes and request for them to be inducted by the company. 

Talent and Leadership Framework 

Scoot began developing a Talent and Leadership Framework in December 

2018 to build up employees’ skillsets. For example, Scoot encourages 

self-assessment and facilitates employee-initiated development by tasking 

managerial-level employees to identify areas for leadership development. 

They also leverage financial schemes supported by the Civil Aviation 

Authority of Singapore to help employees receive formal education, 

allowing them to earn professional certifications, as well as bachelor  

and master’s degrees.

Digital Learning for Scoot Employees

In today’s fast-evolving digital landscape, it is pivotal for employees to 

keep abreast of the latest technology developments. Scoot uses digital 

learning to foster a learning culture and helps employees to respond 

promptly to business needs. In FY2018/19, a total of 22,461 hours were 

spent on e-learning by Scoot employees. Regulatory and compliance 

programmes have also been digitised and launched across the company 

to targeted groups of employees. Sixteen functional-related e-learning 

classes were rolled out to cabin crew and pilots, which translated to 

about 13,653 learning hours in total.

Learning Management System

A Learning Management System (LMS) was set up in June 2018 for cabin 

crew trainees to access training materials online before attending in-class 

training. This allows Scoot’s trainers to better utilise class hours to focus 

on the application of knowledge through techniques such as role playing. 

This initiative has reduced total class time by at least half a day. Moving 

forward, Scoot intends to offer self-directed learning for trainee cabin crew 

as part of their onboarding process through the LMS, so that they can 

better grasp lessons during their classroom training. 

iPads for Crew-in-Charge 

All Scoot crew-in-charge utilise the Cabin Assist App to complete 

administrative tasks such as catering and duty-free report submissions 

on company-issued iPads. The app has greatly improved cabin operation 

efficiency by shortening the turnaround time since June 2018 when Scoot 

moved away from using multiple paper forms that require manual submissions. 

By mid-2019, Scoot targets to push critical information such as safety 

practices and service tips to crew via the iPad before each flight.

Adopting New Point-of-Sale (POS) Tablets 

Since June 2018, Scoot has adopted the use of POS tablets by cabin 

crew on all flights. The tablet integrates end-to-end processing such as 

quantity uplifted, returned stock, sales and billings. The use of the tablet 

significantly reduces backend paperwork performed by cabin crew and 

operational staff. It also allows for more efficient data-mining and sales 

analysis as crew can submit reports on cash transactions, refunds, meal 

substitutions and voyage reports digitally through the device.



Scoot is committed to cultivating a 

collaborative and inclusive workplace 

that provides equal opportunities for 

employees to learn and develop their 

professional skills.

Singapore Airlines’ Supply Chain

Singapore Airlines strives to integrate sustainability across all the touchpoints of our customers’ 

journey. As such, it is crucial for SIA to work closely with our partners and suppliers within the supply 

chain to explore ways to improve and integrate sustainability in all aspects of our operations. 

Divisions such as Customer Experience, Customer Services and Operations, as well as Engineering, 

among others, work closely to ensure that the key aspects of our customers’ experience are met in 

a satisfactory manner, while remaining sustainable. 

Our commitment to providing air transportation services of the highest quality begins on the ground when a customer makes 

a booking with us, then at check-in, followed by on board the aircraft and finally, assisting customers who have feedback and 

require post-flight services.

Supply Chain Expenditure

Singapore Airlines has more than 13,400 suppliers worldwide, and the supply chain is managed by several departments across the organisation. SIA’s supply expenditure 

primarily focuses on aircraft maintenance and rental, fuel costs, in-flight food and beverages, as well as ground operations and handling. SIA also outsources certain key 

airline-related operations to third-party service providers. These include aircraft cleaning and maintenance, catering, certain aspects of customer servicing as well as 

ground handling operations. In FY2018/19, the total expenditure for suppliers’ services engaged by Singapore Airlines was over $12 billion.

Approximately 79 per cent of SIA’s operating expenditure goes to the following 10 suppliers listed below in alphabetical order:

1. Airbus

2. Airbus Flight Hour Services Limited

3. Boeing Commercial Airplane Group

4. Changi Airport Group (Singapore)

5. Chevrontexaco

6. Exxonmobil Aviation

7. SATS Ltd

8. Shell Eastern Petroleum

9. SIA Engineering Company Ltd

10.  Singapore Petroleum Company

Singapore Airlines focuses on integrating sustainability in our business and has adopted the following best practices in our engagement with suppliers: 

 

Anti-Corruption Practices

Clauses on anti-corruption and anti-bribery practices have been included in all new contracts since June 2012. The clauses mandate that all suppliers, including but not 

limited to caterers and ground handling agents, must comply with all local laws where they operate. This includes the acceptance of payments, gifts or other items to 

secure an improper advantage or to influence any decision or act, directly or indirectly. Suppliers are to inform SIA immediately should they learn of any such violations.

Basic Requirements for Catering and Handling Services

It is mandatory for our caterers to comply strictly with local laws and regulations with respect to hygiene, safety and security. Facilities used for storage, preparation, 

as well as the production and transportation of meals and beverages must meet the standards set by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the International 

Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points concept developed and administered by the International Flight Catering Association 

and International Flight Services Association.

All catering and ground handling companies must comply with the IATA Aircraft Handling Manual to ensure ground safety. A copy of the aircraft handling safety standards is 

included in the contract. Catering and ground handling staff also receive training prior to operating in our aircraft.

Each supplier is required to have a system in place to monitor the training needs of their employees to ensure proficiency. Examples of such training include opening aircraft 

doors, driving ground support equipment, handling catering equipment in high lifts and IATA dangerous goods awareness regulations.

Bio-Degradable Material

SIA welcomes proposals from suppliers that include bio-degradable or recyclable materials as alternatives to more commonly used raw materials such as aluminium and plastics. 

SIA is also committed to reducing the use of single-use plastics with alternative sustainable materials for more in-flight items. In FY2019/20, SIA aims to be entirely plastic 

straw-free, and will substitute children’s straws with environmentally-friendly paper straws. Other upcoming green initiatives include the printing of children’s colouring 

books and activity kits using eco-friendly soy-based ink.

Compliance with Applicable Laws

SIA has provisions in purchasing contracts that require suppliers to commit and warrant that the items supplied are in compliance with all applicable laws and related 

requirements, including but not limited to employment laws, industrial laws and labour laws.

Engineering Spares

SIA sources for engineering spares only from Original Equipment Manufacturers and their 

accredited agents even though the procurement of engineering spares has been outsourced. 

For engineering components, repair organisations are required to be certified and approved by 

internationally-recognised authorities such as Australia’s Civil Aviation Safety Authority, European 

Union Aviation Safety Agency and the US Federal Aviation Administration before any procurement 

is carried out.

Consistent with our Safety Management System practices, we have in place key performance 

indicators for warehousing operations to monitor performance in all aspects. This includes the 

environment, health, quality and safety. While we have outsourced warehouse operations to 

supply chain company Bollore Logistics, our Engineering Division continues to chair a joint monthly 

Warehouse Safety Committee Meeting to ensure compliance with our environmental, health and 

safety standards. Bollore Logistics is included in our ISO accreditation by TUV SUD PSB Pte Ltd, a 

globally-recognised company that provides product testing, inspection and certification services.

Environmental Management

Environmental management is one of the key parameters in our assessment of suppliers. SIA’s 

Procurement department conducts factory visits when opportunities arise, so as to assess if the 

suppliers have proper environmental management practices such as ISO 14001 in place. Contracts 

will be prematurely terminated if suppliers are found to be errant. Such suppliers will subsequently 

be barred from doing business with SIA.

Evaluation of Suppliers

Suppliers are evaluated on both cost and quality of the products and services provided. To aid the 

evaluation process, suppliers are required to provide background information on their company, its 

current operations and clients. In addition, suppliers which participate in SIA’s request for proposal 

exercises are deemed to have agreed with the terms set out in the Suppliers’ Code of Conduct. SIA’s 

ongoing long-term target is to conduct spot checks on suppliers when opportunities arise. 

Improving Quality of Service to our Customers

On top of monitoring the performance of suppliers through the Service Level Agreements in our 

contracts, feedback from customers about their ground and in-flight experience is obtained. 

This enables us to further improve on the quality of products and services that we offer to our 

customers across all touchpoints.

Lightweight Design

We are constantly exploring lighter-weight designs of cabin and in-flight items such as cutlery. 

This helps to reduce the amount of fuel needed for flights, which in turn helps to reduce emissions. 

We also look to technological advancements that enable lightweight design of aircraft cabin interiors 

such as seats and in-flight entertainment systems. 

Recycling Obsolete or Scrap Products

As much as it is practicable, we work with suppliers to collect obsolete items from Singapore 

Airlines' local offices and facilities for recycling. These include paper-based, plastic and metal 

products. 

In FY2018/19, SIA installed an eco-digester to digest all canteen waste onsite at our headquarters 

in Singapore. More information on the eco-digester can be found on page 57 of this report.

In addition, staff are encouraged to recycle their e-waste at dedicated waste bins located in SIA's 

offices in Singapore.

Reducing Food Wastage

SIA currently employs customer surveys, data analytics and staff feedback, and works with 

its caterers to reduce food wastage after flights. There are plans to automate data collection 

and further leverage technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to better 

predict customers’ consumption patterns and further reduce cabin food waste. 

Through an improved monitoring system of customers’ consumption patterns and data analytics, 

SIA will be able to better adjust the quantities of certain food items uplifted to minimise wastage 

without compromising on the customer experience. Beyond the initiatives on board, SIA continues 

to seek ways to raise awareness of food wastage and embark on initiatives such as food waste 

recycling, food donations and reduced packaging in FY2019/20.

Sourcing Suppliers with Sustainable Business Practices

SIA encourages and welcomes suppliers to submit environmentally friendly proposals. Such 

proposals are favourably considered during the product assessment and selection stage. For 

example, suppliers are requested to declare in their bid submission if their paper products 

comply with Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) guidelines. Our Procurement department aims to 

ensure paper suppliers have an FSC certification or are able to show that raw materials are not 

sourced from errant suppliers blacklisted by the local government, where such a list exists.

The FSC is an international non-profit, multi-stakeholder organisation established in 1993 to 

promote responsible management of the world’s forests. FSC uses the power of the marketplace 

to protect forests for future generations. Its main tools for achieving this are standards-setting, 

independent certification and labelling of forest products.

Suppliers’ Code of Conduct

The Suppliers’ Code of Conduct was developed in accordance with SIA’s business values, to 

promote sustainable development. Suppliers are required to comply with the code of conduct 

that forms part of the contract. It is also based on the principles of the United Nations Global 

Compact related to anti-corruption, the environment, human rights and labour, and takes into 

account environmental, operational and social issues.

In the event that a supplier is unable to include the code of conduct in their contract, a review 

is carried out by the Public Affairs department and a waiver can only be approved by Divisional 

Vice President Public Affairs or his/her alternate. Through the introduction of the Suppliers’ 

Code of Conduct, SIA aims to have oversight of appointed suppliers’ conduct, and mitigate any 

potential impact they may have to the environment they operate in.

The Suppliers’ Code of Conduct can be found on page 41 of this report.

Local Community Engagement

Singapore Airlines believes in fostering strong 

relationships not only with our customers and business 

partners, but also with the many communities we 

serve. Support is extended to community groups 

through corporate donations, ticket sponsorships and 

staff volunteerism, among others. Singapore Airlines 

actively supports initiatives which promote 

education and sports excellence, the arts, 

as well as the environment and conservation.

Local Community Engagement

Community Projects in Singapore

With a longstanding commitment to help grow the Singapore arts scene, 

Singapore Airlines continued to support the National Arts Council, 

Singapore Chinese Orchestra, Singapore Dance Theatre, Singapore Lyric 

Opera and Singapore Symphony Orchestra. In 2018, Singapore Airlines 

was named ‘Friend of the Arts’ by the National Arts Council, for our 

ongoing contribution to Singapore’s arts scene.

In the educational sector, Singapore Airlines continued to provide 

opportunities for students to help realise their full academic potential. 

Cash and air ticket sponsorships were given to organisations such as 

LASALLE College of the Arts, as well as NTUC Education and Training Fund 

to encourage students and working adults to upgrade their skillsets.

Staff also actively volunteered with charity organisations such as Cerebral 

Palsy Alliance Singapore and Touch Ubi Hostel, among others. To engage 

the beneficiaries, staff volunteers brought them on outings to Changi 

City Point, Rolls-Royce Singapore, as well as on a vintage car ride along 

Orchard Road to view the Christmas lightings during the festive season.

In August 2018, Singapore Airlines’ Cabin Crew Club for Community 

Care collaborated with YWCA and organised a day camp for 60 children 

from Twinkles Club, a club for children from low-income families. Staff 

volunteers from Singapore Airlines and YWCA interacted with the young 

beneficiaries through activities such as decorating photo frames and 

playing Pictionary.

Through the Community Chest, staff also showed their spirit of 

giving during festive periods such as the Lunar New Year, where they 

participated in the annual Fu Dai event. Staff volunteers helped to pack 

the Fu Dai bags comprising festive goodies and delivered them to the less 

fortunate to share the joy of giving during the festive season.

The SIA Group also supported relief efforts conducted by the Singapore 

Red Cross in several disaster-hit regions in 2018. Relief for people affected 

by earthquakes on the Indonesian island of Lombok and floods in the 

Indian state of Kerala were provided through a contribution of $50,000, as 

well as donations of blankets and other relief supplies. SilkAir contributed 

to the efforts by ferrying relief materials to the affected areas, while staff 

volunteers distributed relief supplies in Lombok.

In February 2019, Singapore Airlines collaborated with Make-A-Wish 

Foundation Singapore to fulfill a 15-year-old boy’s wish of being a 

pilot. Staff volunteers brought the beneficiary on a tour of the Airbus 

Asia Training Centre in Singapore to undergo “training” on the aircraft 

simulators, and surprised him with a visit to the Singapore Airlines 

Training Centre, giving him a behind-the-scenes look at how pilots are 

trained. 

Singapore Airlines is proud to play a part in helping 

to better the lives of beneficiaries and will continue 

offering them our support in the years ahead.

SIA KrisFlyer and Make-A-Wish 

Singapore Partnership

KrisFlyer, the SIA Group’s frequent-flyer programme, partners 

Make-A-Wish Singapore to fulfill the wishes of children with life 

threatening illnesses. KrisFlyer miles donated by members go 

towards supporting flights on Singapore Airlines and SilkAir for 

beneficiaries. Since the partnership began in February 2017, 

over 40 wishes have been granted for the beneficiaries and their 

families with more than 18 million miles redeemed. In FY2018/19, 

beneficiaries visited various parts of the world including Australia, 

Hong Kong, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States. 

This scheme is in addition to the support that Singapore Airlines 

provides directly to Make-A-Wish beneficiaries.





 In 2018, Singapore Airlines was 

named 'Friend of the Arts' by 

the National Arts Council.

Harapan Rainforest Initiative

The Harapan Rainforest Initiative, also known 

as Hutan Harapan, is an ecosystem restoration 

concession covering more than 98,000 hectares 

of lowland tropical rainforest in Sumatra, Indonesia. 

The area is rich in biodiversity and remains an 

important habitat for over 1,350 documented 

animal species, including the endangered 

Sumatran tiger and Sumatran elephant. 

Since August 2010, SIA has been the exclusive airline partner 

for the large-scale green initiative aimed at protecting one of 

the world’s most threatened and bio-diverse ecosystems.

The Harapan Rainforest Initiative is driven by a consortium 

of three organisations, namely Burung Indonesia, the Royal 

Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and BirdLife 

International. With strong support from the Indonesian 

government, the Harapan Rainforest Initiative was able to 

expand its biodiversity efforts and support the indigenous 

communities, among other initiatives.













Preventing 

Deforestation to 

Ensure Amphibian 

Diversity

Hutan Harapan’s forests, 

rivers, lakes and swamps 

contain a wealth of 

flora and fauna. Fifty-

five amphibian species 

have been identified 

as threatened or 

endangered. To further 

understand their ecology, 

research has been 

undertaken on Hutan 

Harapan’s complex 

ecosystem of frogs 

and toads.



Improving Accessibility 

to Health Care Services

Accessibility to health care 

services in Hutan Harapan was 

improved after a clinic was set 

up near the base camp. With 

two nurses on site to provide 

daily care and a doctor who is 

available on request basis, the 

communities in Hutan Harapan 

can obtain proper health care 

conveniently for common 

ailments. As the team continues 

to provide information on 

sanitation and how to lead 

a healthy lifestyle, plans are 

underway to expand the clinic 

in terms of size and manpower 

after securing more funds.

Outdoor Education 

Programmes for Visitors

Public awareness and 

education are important 

elements of ecosystem 

restoration in Hutan Harapan. 

A variety of activities to attract 

visitors to experience the 

outdoors was implemented. 

In FY2018/19, Hutan Harapan’s 

ecotourism team conducted 

an education camp to educate 

participants about forest 

restoration. As part of the 

camp, participants explored 

forest trails and learnt how 

to tap and process rubber to 

increase their understanding 

of the environment.

Community 

Engagement 

to Mitigate 

Encroachment 

Activities

Encroachment and illegal 

logging remain two main 

threats to the ecological 

integrity of Hutan Harapan. 

As part of Hutan Harapan’s 

commitment to prevent 

such activities, local 

communities have been 

engaged to secure their 

support for conservation 

and to prevent 

encroachment. 

Protecting Hutan 

Harapan’s Sumatran 

Tigers

As a critically endangered 

animal, the Sumatran tiger 

faces the risk of extinction. 

To combat this, Hutan 

Harapan relies on forest 

patrols and camera traps 

to monitor the Sumatran 

tigers and protect them 

from poaching. The 

data collected assists 

in identifying potential 

zones where human-tiger 

conflicts may occur. 

Agroforestry Programme

In FY2018/19, Hutan Harapan was actively 

promoted as a test bed for agroforestry. 

To support community livelihoods in Hutan 

Harapan, a 10-year agroforestry plan was 

developed to initiate farming within the 

community with the provision of seedlings, 

water pumps, herbicides and technical 

assistance. In addition, a series of workshops 

was conducted on cow breeding, which allows 

communities which have made good progress 

in planting to diversify their income. Two 

rubber latex processing units powered by 

solar panels were also constructed in Hutan 

Harapan to produce ribbed smoked sheets.

SIA’s Sustainability Policy

Rising global temperatures are altering climate zones around the planet.  Since 2015, each year has surpassed 

the previous to make it the warmest year on record. Globally, there has been an increase in the occurrence 

of severe weather and climate events such as typhoons and snowstorms, which have adversely affected the 

aviation industry’s operations. 

With more than 200 of our aircraft taking to the skies daily, the SIA Group remains dedicated to our long-term 

responsibility to protect the environment while providing air transportation services of the highest quality. We 

have in place various programmes to implement sustainable practices across our operations in a responsible 

manner to manage issues such as carbon emissions, waste, noise and the consumption of energy and 

resources. We also continue to explore new sustainable practices in all areas of our operations.

Singapore Airlines continues to invest in a modern fleet, and regularly seeks ways to improve fuel efficiency 

by optimising our flight routings and engaging in effective aircraft weight management. We strive to improve 

fuel efficiency by enhancing our flight operations measures and using data analytics to measure our aircraft 

performance. SIA partners with air navigation service providers to reduce fuel burn in all flight phases, and 

to incorporate best practices in air traffic management. These measures help to reduce our emissions. In 

addition, we are an active member of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group (SAFUG), which is committed to 

accelerating the development and commercialisation of sustainable aviation fuels.

Singapore signed the Paris Agreement in 2015, which aims to reduce our emissions intensity by 36 per cent by 

2030, relative to 2005 levels. Singapore’s Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources marked 2018 as 

the Year of Climate Action for Singapore. In support of this, SIA submitted a Climate Action Pledge to signal our 

dedication towards environmental protection and sustainable operations.

Although the aviation sector contributes to two per cent of global carbon emissions, it recognises the need to 

address the global challenge of climate change. This is reflected in the International Air Transport Association’s 

(IATA) three targets and four-pillar strategy.

Managing SIA’s Environmental Impact

IATA’s Climate Targets

The aviation industry aims to achieve three global climate targets to mitigate CO2 emissions from air transport:

An average improvement in fuel efficiency of 1.5% 

per year from 2009 to 2020 

A cap on net aviation CO2 emissions from 

2020  (carbon-neutral growth) 

A reduction in net aviation CO2 emissions of 50% by 

2050, relative to 2005 levels

IATA’s Four-Pillar Strategy

Singapore Airlines supports IATA’s three global climate targets and has adopted the four-pillar strategy in our operations to reduce our carbon footprint. The strategy includes:

Improved technology, including 

the deployment of sustainable 

alternative fuels 

More efficient aircraft operations 

Infrastructure improvements, 

including modernised air traffic 

management systems 

A single global market-based 

measure to fill the remaining 

emissions gap

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group (SAFUG)

SIA has since 2011 been an active member of SAFUG, which was established to accelerate the development and commercialisation of Sustainable 

Aviation Fuels (SAF). Compared to traditional jet fuels, SAF can reduce up to 80 per cent of carbon emissions based on a full carbon life cycle. SIA 

sees SAF as a long-term measure to support the aviation industry’s carbon-neutral growth goal beyond 2020.

SIA has pledged to advance and adopt aviation biofuels produced in a sustainable way, which: 

 

u Exhibit minimal impact on biodiversity; 

 

u Meet a sustainability standard, with respect to land, 

water and energy use; 

 

u Do not displace or compete with food crops; and  

 

u Provide a positive socio-economic impact.

Singapore Airlines’ ‘Green Package’ Flights

In line with our commitment to reduce international aviation emissions, Singapore Airlines partnered the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) 

and operated a series of 12 ‘green package’ flights over a three-month period in May 2017 on its non-stop San Francisco-Singapore route. These flights 

featured SIA’s latest-generation and most fuel-efficient aircraft – the Airbus A350-900 – together with Sustainable Aviation Fuels, and optimised air 

traffic management best practices. 

This initiative, which combined the use of biofuel, optimised flight operations and the latest fuel-efficient aircraft to reduce fuel burn and carbon 

emissions, helped to raise awareness of sustainable biofuels for aviation. It also provided the industry with valuable insights into the economics, 

logistical requirements and performance of biofuels.

All 12 ‘green package’ flights were powered by a combination of Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), a sustainable biofuel produced from 

used cooking oils and conventional jet fuel with a life cycle potential reduction of 80 per cent carbon emissions as compared to traditional jet fuel. The 

biofuel was produced by AltAir Fuels (now known as World Energy), and was supplied and delivered to San Francisco by SkyNRG in collaboration with 

North American Fuel Corporation (NAFCO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Aviation Oil (Singapore) and EPIC Fuels.

Singapore Airlines remains committed to working alongside government agencies and stakeholders to overcome any supply, infrastructure and 

economic challenges that could hinder the commercial use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels.

Pillar 2: Operational Measures

Fuel Productivity Initiatives

As part of our ongoing commitment to sustainability, SIA is constantly looking for opportunities and methods to reduce our carbon emissions to mitigate the impact of climate change. This is done through various fuel productivity and savings initiatives. 

We measure and report carbon emissions direct from fuel use in flight operations using carbon intensity ratio in kilograms of carbon dioxide emitted per load-tonne-kilometre (LTK). Data from Scoot will be progressively included in future Sustainability Reports.

Currently, SIA’s key initiatives from our fuel productivity improvement programme include:

Pillar 3: Improved Infrastructure

Infrastructure improvements present an opportunity for airlines to reduce fuel use and 

CO2 emissions. Such improvements are led by the optimisation of air routes through 

efficient air traffic management.

Singapore Airlines collaborates with stakeholders in Air Traffic Management to explore 

ways to improve airspace incremental efficiency. We believe that innovation and data 

analytics will pave the way for more significant improvements, and have started engaging 

research institutions to explore such ideas.

Pillar 4: Global Market-Based Measure (MBM)

At the 39th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly in 2016, ICAO’s 

Member States adopted a global carbon offsetting scheme for international aviation. This 

was an unprecedented commitment of its type for any industry. The MBM, also known 

as the Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), aims to 

address the annual increase in total CO2 emissions from international civil aviation beyond 

2020. It also serves as an interim approach to reduce carbon emissions while the first three 

pillars of the four-pillar strategy mature.

The implementation of CORSIA is applicable to international aviation emissions and 

eliminates the duplication of economic measures. It is forecasted that CORSIA will mitigate 

approximately 2.5 billion tonnes of CO2 between 2021 and 2035, which is an average 

of 165 million tonnes of CO2 annually. CORSIA’s approach is based on the comparison 

of total CO2 emissions for a year (from 2021 onwards), against a baseline level of CO2 

emissions. This is defined as the average of CO2 emissions from international aviation 

covered by CORSIA in 2019 and 2020.

SIA recognises that CORSIA will play an integral role in achieving carbon neutral growth in 

a cost-efficient manner. As such, SIA fully supports the ongoing efforts towards meeting 

the requirements in the CORSIA Monitoring, Reporting and Verification system of carbon 

emissions. As of 1 January 2019, SIA has started monitoring and reporting our CO2 

emissions on an annual basis. 

Singapore will voluntarily participate in CORSIA from 2021 to 2026, after which the 

scheme becomes mandatory.

Four-Pillar Strategy (Cont’d)

Aircraft Noise

ICAO’s international standards for aircraft noise were adopted in 1971. Since then, certification standards have periodically been made more stringent. In 2006, 

ICAO introduced a new and more stringent Chapter 4 noise standard as part of its Balanced Approach to Aircraft Noise Management, to reduce noise at its source. 

The continual improvements in noise certification standards ensure that the latest noise reduction technology is incorporated into aircraft design.

SIA focuses on reducing aircraft engine noise at its source. Compared to aircraft manufactured more than 10 years ago, modern jet aircraft are approximately 50 

per cent quieter. Continuous improvements are being made to further reduce engine noise emissions, which result in noise reduction around airports. 

With SIA’s fleet renewal programme, the noise footprint of new aircraft is at least 15 per cent smaller than that of SIA’s previous aircraft fleet. SIA’s current fleet 

of Airbus A330-300, A350-900, A380-800, Boeing 777-200, 777-200ER, 777-300, 777-300ER and 787-10 aircraft; SilkAir’s A319, A320, 737 MAX 8 and 737-800 aircraft; 

as well as Scoot’s Airbus A319, A320, 787-8 and 787-9 aircraft, all meet the latest ICAO Chapter 4 noise standard.



SIA focuses on reducing 

aircraft engine noise at its 

source. Compared to aircraft 

manufactured more than 10 

years ago, modern jet aircraft are 

approximately 50 per cent quieter.

Aircraft Emissions

ICAO sets the international standards for NOx, CO2, hydrocarbons and 

exhaust levels from aircraft engine emissions under ICAO Annex 16, Volume 

III. This standard is applicable to new aircraft designs as of 2020, as well as

new deliveries of current in-production aircraft types from 2023. SIA supports

the new CO2 standard set by ICAO so as to meet the aviation industry’s long-

term commitment to reduce CO2 emissions.

The current NOx standard, endorsed in 2004 and applicable to new engines 

manufactured from 2008, is 12 per cent stricter than previous standards. SIA’s 

passenger and freighter fleets, together with SilkAir and Scoot aircraft, meet 

the stringent 2004 ICAO CAEP/6 Emissions Standards for NOx. 

Ground Emissions

All new and existing vehicles on the ground powered by diesel or petrol comply 

with the National Environment Agency’s requirements on motor vehicle 

emissions. Vehicles also undergo regular maintenance and inspections. For 

example, diesel-powered vehicles undergo an annual Chassis Dynamometer 

Smoke Test to ensure the smoke opacity limit meets local standards. Staff are 

also reminded to adhere to anti-idling engine regulations and switch off idle 

engines to conserve fuel and promote cleaner air. 

Other Environmental Measures

As part of the SIA Group’s ongoing conservation efforts, energy and water consumption levels in buildings owned by SIA or SIA Engineering Company (SIAEC) are monitored by the respective 

Facilities teams. 

Consumption figures are reviewed by the Occupational Safety, Health and Environment Committee on a quarterly basis and updates are provided to SIA’s Management. These figures are tracked  

and compared across the years to ensure that we match or lower our utilities consumption as a company. 

SIA is committed to achieving a 15 per cent reduction in our office electricity consumption by FY2020/21 from base year FY2010/11.

Energy and Water Conservation Initiatives

SIA’s energy-saving initiatives in FY2018/19 continued to focus on managing air-conditioning and lighting within buildings and hangars. We are guided by the Singapore Energy Market Authority’s 

electricity conservation adoption, reporting standards and methodologies of electricity conservation. 

SIA’s five-year plan for upcoming equipment retrofitting works will guide us in ensuring that all equipment supporting our buildings is energy efficient and in good condition. SIA’s Facilities team also 

conducts regular reviews to assess if there are better technologies or more efficient methods for building essentials pertaining to air-conditioning, lighting and water. 

In FY2018/19, SIA embarked on a study to harvest solar energy to support the use of green energy to meet our buildings’ energy needs. Some of our other energy-saving efforts include:

Waste Management

SIA targets to achieve a 30 per cent reduction in waste generation from our buildings from FY2020/21 from base year FY2010/11.

In FY2018/19, SIA disposed of 2,587 tonnes of waste accumulated from our office buildings. All the Toxic Industrial Waste (TIW) generated from our aircraft maintenance activities is labelled and 

segregated from general waste, which is collected by licenced general waste collectors and sent for incineration in waste-to-energy plants. A licenced TIW collector is engaged to remove and treat the TIW 

before final disposal. No industrial effluents are generated from our commercial activities and all waste water is discharged to government-operated water reclamation plants for treatment.

To meet SIA’s waste reduction target, short-term targets are set at departmental level to reduce paper use or to go paperless within three to five years. Longer-term targets include exploring waste 

reduction initiatives such as food waste recycling and working towards paperless in-flight menus.

An eco-digester was installed in March 2019 to digest all canteen waste onsite at Singapore Airlines’ headquarters in Singapore. The eco-digester eliminates the need to transport approximately 650kg to 

900kg worth of canteen waste per day to the incineration plant, reducing greenhouse gas production emitted through transportation. More information on the eco-digester can be found on page 57.

SIA incorporates the three Rs in our daily activities to improve our waste management practices and maximise efficient use of resources:

Reduce

u

u All departments are encouraged 

to store documents electronically 

in the Document Management 

System

u

u Reference materials are 

displayed digitally for meetings 

Reuse

u

u Delivery of internal correspondence 

in envelopes designed for 

multiple use

u

u Empty wine bottles from our 

aircraft are collected and 

brought to the SIA Training 

Centre for training purposes

u

u Upcycling workshops are 

conducted by our crew to 

teach employees how to reuse 

in-flight menus. Rejected or old 

crew uniforms are used as art 

and craft materials for charity 

events



Recycle

u

u Carton boxes, magazines, 

newspapers and glass bottles 

are collected after flights for 

recycling

u

u Empty printer toner catridges are 

collected and sent for recycling 

on a regular basis 

u

u Paper recycling is practised 

across the entire organisation in 

all offices

u

u Staff are encouraged to recycle 

electronic waste through a 

company-wide collection and 

recycling campaign on electronic 

waste. Permanent electronic 

waste bins are placed in office 

premises to encourage staff to 

recycle personal e-waste items

Staff Canteen Transformation

Singapore’s Ministry of the Environment &amp; Water Resources declared 2019 as the Year towards Zero Waste, encouraging the 

public to reduce and recycle food waste, and to redistribute excess food. This issue has gained some urgency in recent years, 

with food waste accounting for 10 per cent of total waste generated in Singapore, with a small fraction of that being recycled.

In our efforts to reduce environmental impact fom canteen operations, SIA has embarked on a series of initiatives to transform 

the staff canteen operations. This includes diverting our canteen waste away from the incineration plant by recycling our food 

waste and foodware on site.

F

Foodware Switch and Bring Your Own Utensils (B-YOU) Campaign

In August 2018, all 25 food stalls in the staff canteen made the switch from styrofoam to paper-based or biodegradable foodware, 

eliminating the use of styrofoam in the canteen. 

A Bring Your Own Utensils (B-YOU) drive was held across a six-day period in September 2018 to raise environmental awareness 

among employees. Staff were encouraged to bring their personal utensils (bowls, plates, food containers, cups and cutlery) to 

reduce the consumption of single-use disposables in the canteen. A campaign booth was also set up to disseminate educational 

information on the environment, and to support sales of eco-friendly items sold by The Green Collective. 

The B-YOU drive was preceded by a quiz, which saw over 300 staff take part. Employees also actively participated in the B-YOU 

Buddy Challenge, where they posted photos of their meals using their own utensils and cutlery on SIA’s internal social media platform. 







In August 2018, all 25 food stalls in the 

staff canteen made the switch from 

styrofoam to paper-based or 

biodegradable foodware, eliminating 

the use of styrofoam in the canteen. 

Eco-Digester

An eco-digester by Eco-Wiz Group Pte Ltd was installed in March 2019 to digest 

all canteen waste onsite at Singapore Airlines’ headquarters in Singapore. This 

eliminates the need to transport approximately 650kg to 900kg worth of canteen 

waste daily from the Airline’s headquarters to the Tuas Incineration Plant, reducing 

greenhouse gas production emitted through transportation. In addition, the use of an 

eco-digester avoids greenhouse gas emissions from the incineration of waste daily. 

The eco-digester has the ability to break down and reduce the volume of all organic 

and inorganic waste by approximately 90 per cent and 50 per cent respectively. It then 

converts the waste into Refuse-Derived Fuels (RDF), which is a type of alternative 

energy in the form of energy pellet fuels. These energy pellet fuels are used for 

thermal energy in power plants. 

To further promote a holistic approach towards sustainable canteen operations, 

22 new recycling bins were installed. This ensures that all canteen waste is either 

recycled or digested by the eco-digester, resulting in a zero-waste canteen.

These initiatives highlight Singapore Airlines’ commitment towards achieving our 

target of a 30 per cent reduction in waste generation from our buildings by FY2020/21, 

from the base year FY2010/11.

Let’s Erase E-Waste 2018

Over 60,000 tonnes of electronic waste is produced in Singapore annually. Based on a study by the National Environment Agency, approximately six 

per cent of electronic waste is recycled through recycling bins island-wide. Electronic waste also contains toxic substances, and its improper disposal 

can lead to serious pollution and health issues.

Following 2016’s successful electronic waste recycling campaign, Singapore Airlines and Cimelia Resource Recovery re-launched the ‘Let’s Erase E-Waste’ 

campaign in conjunction with World Environment Day on 5 June 2018. Staff were encouraged to recycle electronic waste at dedicated e-waste bins 

located in Singapore Airlines’ offices in Singapore. The week-long campaign received overwhelming support from staff who took the initiative to recycle 

old electronic items from their homes and their offices. 

A total of 2,236kg worth of electronic waste was recycled by staff during the campaign period. This was a 56 per cent increase from the 2016 electronic 

waste recycling campaign. Through ‘Let’s Erase E-Waste’, staff were made aware of how they can do their part to reduce pollution caused by the 

inappropriate disposal of electronic waste. 

To further encourage staff to be responsible in disposing of their electronic waste, four e-waste bins have been permanently placed in Singapore 

Airlines’ offices in Singapore. The electronic waste is collected monthly. 

Sustainable Food Sourcing

Expanding on the Airline’s ’From Farm to Plane’ concept introduced in 2017, which promotes environmental sustainability and supports local farming 

communities, SIA will be embarking on a new collaboration with AeroFarms, the world’s largest indoor vertical farm of its kind based in Newark, United 

States. Produce at AeroFarms is grown indoors without soil, pesticides or sunlight, using AeroFarms’ award-winning aeroponic technology. AeroFarms 

will provide a customised blend of fresh produce for SIA’s New York (Newark Liberty International Airport) to Singapore flights from September 2019.

Prevention of Illegal Wildlife Trafficking

Wildlife traffickers regularly exploit the increasing connectivity of global transportation and leverage the supply chain industry for their illegal trade. 

In support of efforts to prevent illegal trafficking and transportation of wildlife as well as their products, SIA signed the United for Wildlife Transport 

Taskforce Buckingham Palace Declaration in June 2017.



As a signatory, SIA agrees to implement actions under the relevant commitments outlined in the Declaration, such as adopting a zero tolerance policy 

regarding illegal wildlife trade, increasing awareness among passengers and staff, providing staff training to identify and report suspected illegal 

transport of wildlife, and engaging the relevant stakeholders in these efforts. 

SIA is against the illegal transport of wildlife and unsustainable animal products. The Company also prohibits the carriage of any animals or wildlife by 

passengers, with the exception of domesticated cats and dogs that are checked in, as well as service and emotional support dogs in the cabin. 

Cutting Down on In-flight Wastage

SIA currently employs customer surveys, data analytics and staff feedback, and works with its caterers to reduce food wastage after flights. The Airline 

plans to automate data collection and leverage technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to better predict customers’ consumption 

patterns and further reduce cabin food waste. Through an improved monitoring system of customers’ consumption patterns and data analytics, SIA will 

be able to better adjust the quantities of certain food items uplifted to minimise wastage without compromising the customer experience.

In a bid to reduce the amount of paper used on board our flights, SIA increased the number of publications available on its e-Library, a feature available 

in the SingaporeAir mobile application. Customers are able to download their preferred reading materials before their flight, thereby reducing the amount 

of newspapers and magazines uplifted.

SIA is committed to reducing the use of single-use plastics with alternative sustainable materials for more in-flight items. We aim to be entirely plastic 

straw-free by September 2019, replacing them with environmentally-friendly paper straws. This change will eliminate the use of about 820,000 plastic 

straws annually. SIA also plans to replace its current plastic swizzle sticks with wood-based ones by September 2019. 

From May 2019, polybags for children’s toys will be replaced with recyclable paper packaging. Our paper products such as menu cards, tissue paper 

and toilet rolls are made with FSC-certified paper, which is sourced in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. Other upcoming green 

initiatives include the printing of children’s colouring books and activity kits using eco-friendly soy-based ink.
