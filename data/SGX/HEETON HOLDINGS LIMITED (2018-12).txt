 Heeton Holdings Limited Sustainability Report FY2018 

BOARD STATEMENT 

GRI 102-14 

Heeton 

delivers 

stakeholder 

value 

by 

converting opportunity into growth. Our 

reputation as a property developer is 

underpinned by a distinctive, high-quality 

portfolio of properties in the, residential, 

commercial and hospitality sectors. 

We aim to become a strategic player on the 

international hospitality stage and, as at 

December 2018, our hotel portfolio has 

expanded to 11 properties.  

In recent years, this sector has seen a surge in 

public concern about the impact of hotel 

development on the environment and local 

communities. Heeton recognises that its 

development strategy must consider the 

wider expectations of all our stakeholders, 

including 

customers, 

employees 

and 

investors.  

Global standards and stronger local regulatory 

requirements for both the real estate and 

hospitality sectors drive us to regularly review 

key areas, such as workplace health and 

safety, and reducing energy and water 

consumption. Not only does this bring 

environmental and social benefits, but it also 

improves our economic efficiency.  Our 

evolution towards more sustainable practices 

also attracts a new generation of talent and 

customers who are more environmentally 

conscious.  

Heeton’s 

Board 

oversees 

the 

Group’s 

sustainability strategy and the development 

of policies and management structures to 

monitor 

and 

report 

our 

social 

and 

environmental 

performance. 

A 

recent 

materiality 

assessment 

identified 

10 

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 

factors 

that 

represent 

key 

risks 

and 

opportunities for our business and address 

the concerns of our stakeholders. 

In addition to strong internal governance 

policies and procedures to prevent corruption 

and ensure regulatory compliance, we have 

implemented management approaches and 

targets for talent retention, health and safety, 

supplier assessment, and energy and water 

efficiency.  

This Sustainability Report highlights our 

achievements and targets in key material 

areas and efforts to positively impact our 

stakeholders. 

We 

have 

improved 

our 

reporting 

approach 

to 

include 

the 

sustainability performance of the six hotels 

under our full management.    

We will continue to create value for our 

shareholders 

while 

benefitting 

all 

stakeholders through actions to reduce our 

societal and environmental impacts. To meet 

this objective, Heeton will continue to 

improve sustainability reporting throughout 

its value chain.  

We look forward to engaging with all our 

stakeholders as we continue our journey 

towards a sustainable future.

ABOUT THIS REPORT 

GRI 102-45, 102-48, 102-49, 102-50, 102-51, 102-52 

This second annual Sustainability Report presents Heeton’s environmental, social performance and 

governance for the period January 2018 to December 2018 (FY2018). We also introduce the local 

and global policies, initiatives and goals that frame our sustainability agenda.  

Improvements made since the publication of our first Sustainability Report in August  2018 include 

the addition of performance data from six hotels in the UK and the alignment of the report to the 

latest Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards.  

REPORTING SCOPE  

This report covers the activities and assets over which Heeton has operational control. This includes 

policies and management approaches applied at our headquarters in Singapore and all our 

completed property development projects, investment properties and hotels, which are listed

We report social and environmental performance figures for the operations that we directly 

manage. These include our headquarters in Singapore and six hotels in the UK. We also report 

environmental performance for two investment properties located in Singapore. We currently do

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT  

GRI 102-40, 102-42, 102-43, 102-44,102-46, 102-47 

In 

2017, 

with 

the 

assistance 

of 

an 

independent consultant, we undertook a 

materiality assessment exercise to identify the 

factors 

defining 

Heeton’s 

economic, 

environmental 

and 

social 

impacts. 

We 

conducted secondary research to refine and 

shortlist the material factors most relevant to 

our business. As part of the research, we 

looked 

at 

emerging 

global 

and 

local 

sustainability trends as well as main topics 

and future challenges for the real estate 

sector (as identified by peers). Our investors, 

tenants, employees, communities, regulators, 

and business partners have been identified as 

our six key stakeholder groups. 

Based on these research findings, the extent 

of impact on Heeton’s business, and key 

stakeholders’ concerns, the following 10 

material 

factors 

were 

identified.

 Heeton Holdings Limited Sustainability Report FY2018 

OUR GOVERNANCE  

GRI 102-16, 102-18 

Heeton considers high ethical standards in compliance, transparency, and business conduct to be 

the key to lasting stakeholders trust and confidence. 

To ensure that we run our operations and grow our business with integrity, we have implemented 

robust governance-related policies and procedures. 

Our Board oversees the corporate governance structure and sustainability strategy of the Group. It is 

also responsible for the overall management and reporting of sustainability performance and 

receives regular reports on sustainability-related issues from the relevant heads of business units. 

These managers also participate in the development of Heeton’s sustainability policies and are in 

charge of integrating appropriate practices and procedures into our operations. 

Our employees are expected to conduct themselves with honesty and integrity at work. Heeton’s 

code of conduct is included in the Group’s Employee Handbook, together with regulations and 

guidelines on issues such as discipline, outside employment, confidentiality, and intellectual 

property. 

PREVENTING CORRUPTION 

GRI 205-2, 205-3 

Heeton is committed to upholding a high level 

of business ethics and integrity, including 

amongst our suppliers and business partners. 

We believe that the prevention of corruption 

in our value chain is vital to safeguard the 

interests of our stakeholders and Heeton’s 

reputation. All forms of corruption are 

forbidden: 

this 

encompasses 

dishonest 

business practices such as conflict of interest, 

acceptance of gifts, or improper use of insider 

information.  

Employees are required to adhere to our 

corporate policies on anti-corruption, anti-

money 

laundering, 

whistle-blowing, 

and 

black-out periods. All new hires are required 

to go through a mandatory induction 

programme where they are made aware of 

these policies, and our code of conduct and 

procedures.  

We are pleased to report that there were no 

incidents of corruption at our headquarters or 

managed hotels during FY2018, and we aim to 

maintain 

zero 

corruption 

incidents 

for 

FY2019. 

Our whistleblowing policy aims to encourage 

responsible and secure reporting of any 

incident of violation or suspected violation of 

our code of conduct, such as unethical or 

illegal practices. Should such an incident 

occur, it should be reported to a member of 

Heeton’s management.  

In case of any dissatisfaction with the 

handling of the report,  the matter can be 

escalated to the Executive Deputy Chairman 

or the Audit Committee Chairman.

ENSURING COMPLIANCE  

GRI 307-1 

Compliance with environmental and social 

laws is the baseline to meet stakeholders’ 

expectations and maintain the license to 

operate.  

Our operations and properties in Singapore 

are subject to multiple laws and regulations, 

such as the Workplace Safety and Health Act, 

the 

Environmental 

Protection 

and 

Management 

Act 

and 

the 

Energy 

Conservation Act, covering air pollution, 

noise, wastewater discharge and other 

environmental impacts. For our overseas 

portfolio, 

including 

our 

property 

developments, we abide by all applicable 

environmental and social legislations.   

We actively identify and manage our 

regulatory risks and we keep abreast of 

developments in sustainability-related law 

and related legislative updates. We also 

ensure that our suppliers and partners abide 

by all relevant regulations. 

In FY2018, our operations bore no incidence 

of non-compliance with laws and regulations 

in the environmental social and economic 

areas which resulted in significant fines or 

sanctions. Looking forward, we will continue 

our efforts to ensure full environmental 

compliance in all our operations and to 

further reduce our environmental impacts.   

MANAGING ESG ISSUES IN OUR VALUE CHAIN 

Heeton promotes sustainability across its 

value chain. The nature of our real estate 

business often requires the appointment of a 

third-party service provider, or collaboration 

with a joint venture partner. We recognise the 

importance of maintaining transparency and 

working responsibly with these external 

parties and others in our value chain.  

We prioritise suppliers and contractors who 

engage in sustainable practices to ensure safe 

working conditions and respect worker rights. 

All Heeton’s suppliers are encouraged to 

adhere to best practices and industry 

standards, such as obtaining Building and 

Construction Authority (BCA) certifications.  

We also conduct regular checks on our 

suppliers and business partners for anti-

money 

laundering 

or 

other 

unethical 

practices. This includes keeping a close watch 

on our joint venture partners in the news 

coverage and ensuring that any ESG issues are 

addressed promptly.  

Our supply chain 

GRI 102-9 

In Singapore, our suppliers are mainly locally based and consist of utilities providers and agencies for 

office supply, information technology, travel and maintenance tasks at our headquarters. Our two 

managed investment properties in Singapore rely on external providers for cleaning, security, pest 

control and other maintenance services. Our six managed hotels in the UK rely on hundreds of small-

to-large suppliers, including food, beverage and professional service providers.  

We ensure that suppliers’ personnel are covered by our internal policies and requirements, such as 

safety and security, when they are working at our premises.  




10 

 Heeton Holdings Limited Sustainability Report FY2018 

GROWING WITH OUR PEOPLE  

In our rapidly changing business landscape, the attraction, recruitment and retention of skilled 

employees with relevant and current expertise is important. We recognise the value that our 

employees bring to the Group and are proud of their contribution to our on-going success and 

sustainability. 

DIVERSIFYING OUR WORKFORCE 

GRI 102-8, 405-1 

As at 31 December 2018, our workforce 

comprised 157 employees. This includes 44 

employees at our headquarters and 113 

employees at our six hotels in the UK. 

Globally, 16 (10.2% of total) of our employees 

held a senior management position, 52 

(33.1%) held manager or executive roles, and 

89 (56.7%) were non-executives. 

Globally, women made up 58% of our 

workforce. In terms of employee categories, 

women represented 43.8% of senior manage-

ment, 61.5% of managers or executives and 

58.4% 

of 

non-executives. 

35% 

of 

our 

workforce were below 30 years of age, 51% 

were aged between 30 and 50 years, and 14% 

were aged above 50 years. Figures for the two 

older workforce age groups were relatively 

similar at our headquarters and our hotels, 

however, employees below 30 years of age 

represented 43.4% of the hotels’ workforce 

but 

comprised 

only 

13.6% 

of 

our 

headquarters’ workforce.  

Heeton’s 

human 

resource 

policies 

are 

grounded in equal opportunities and fair 

employment practices. In our recruitment 

process, 

all 

qualified 

candidates 

are 

considered without discrimination of gender, 

age, ethnicity, religion and national origin. Our 

employees are promoted based on merit and 

performance. We also value the expertise of 

older employees and continue to employ 

individuals over the national retirement age.

VALUING AND RETAINING OUR EMPLOYEES 

GRI 401-1

In recognition of their contribution to the 

success of Heeton’s business, and to retain 

our skilled workforce, we reward employees 

with competitive salaries in line with market 

standards. 

Compensation 

to 

individual 

employees is determined by their position, 

competency and performance. Furthermore, 

employees are entitled to a variety of 

benefits, such as medical care, paid annual 

leave and birthday leave. They can also opt 

for a flexible work arrangement.   

Our Employee Handbook general guidelines 

about our policies, procedures and practices, 

terms and conditions, as well as the 

compensation and benefits package available 

to them. 

In FY2018, we hired seven new staff at our 

headquarters and 53 new staff at our hotels in 

the UK, representing monthly hire rates of 

8.3% and 4.4% respectively. Globally, the 

average monthly hire rate was 1.9% for 

female employees and 4.5% for male 

employees.  

During the year, our headquarters had a 

monthly turnover rate of 8.3% with nine 

employees leaving the company, while the 

turnover rate at our hotels in the UK was 6.8% 

with 82 leavers. Globally, the average monthly 

turnover 

rates 

for 

female 

and 

male 

employees were 4.6% and 3.0% respectively.  

Most of new hires and leavers were in the 

‘under 30’ and ’30 to 50’ age groups. In the 

‘over 50’ age group, two employees were 

hired and three left the company during the 

year. 

For FY2019, we will continue our effort to 

keep our employee turnover rate equal or 

below 8.3%.

ENHANCING THE SKILLS OF OUR EMPLOYEES 

GRI 404-1, 404-3 

In a dynamic business environment, Heeton 

recognises the need to arm our employees 

with new skills necessary to sustain our 

growth.  

Our active approach to learning supports the 

personal and professional development of our 

employees through training programmes 

designed to empower them to reach their full 

potential and keep them abreast of new 

technologies and opportunities in real estate 

sector. Training is carried out on topics 

including 

management 

and 

leadership, 

information technology (e.g. cybersecurity) 

and safety (e.g. First aid). 

We also encourage employees to attend 

external 

courses 

for 

their 

professional 

development. Our employees can apply for 

financial sponsorship for eligible courses and 

be granted up to seven days of study leave 

per year. 

Our Human Resources Department tracks and 

monitors the training records of employees. 

One-on-one reviews are conducted post-

training to highlight any gaps in the 

programme or identify new training needs. In 

FY2018, we conducted an average of 5.2 

hours of training per employee globally. 

Senior management and female employees 

benefitted from the highest number of 

training hours with an average of 10.4 hours 

and 5.9 hours respectively. For FY2019, we 

aim to maintain or exceed an average of 5.2 

hours of training per employee. 

We conduct annual reviews with employees 

during which we discuss performance and 

career goals to support their professional 

growth. In FY2018, 100% of headquarter 

employees 

received 

feedback 

on 

their 

performance 

and 

suggestions 

on 

improvement from their supervisors.  

We will continue to engage with our 

employees 

to 

fine-tune 

our 

training 

programmes and align them to their learning 

needs.

OUR SAFETY PRACTICES  

GRI 402-1, 403-2, 403-3, 403-4, 403-5, 403-7, 403-9, 416-1, 416-2 

As an employer and landlord, Heeton 

recognises its responsibility to ensure that our 

employees, customers and all other users of 

our premises can enjoy a safe and healthy 

environment.  

We regularly assess our safety practices to 

identify 

potential 

hazards 

within 

our 

operations. Risk assessment is reviewed and 

updated to follow preventive and corrective 

action plans.  

We 

provide 

an 

open 

channel 

of  

communication across all levels of the Group 

to gather feedback on issues relating to health 

and safety. In addition, we aim to inculcate a 

culture of ownership for health and safety 

among employees and tenants through 

regular 

safety 

education 

and 

training, 

including fire drills and first aid courses.  

As part of their induction, operational teams 

complete an on-line health and safety training 

programme and must familiarise themselves 

with their workplace. They are also instructed 

to report any hazards identified. Where 

required, suppliers and visitors to the 

premises must sign in and are supervised by 

our trained employees.   

Standard safety procedures and contingency 

plans have been established at all our 

properties and hotels. This includes internal 

and external audits, fire safety practices and 

regular fire safety audits and drills led by our 

property managers. Equipment is inspected 

and upgraded whenever necessary to ensure 

that it is in sound working condition. The 

property 

managers 

also 

ensure 

timely 

renewal of operating permits and licenses for 

fire safety installations, lifts and escalators 

and areas of high safety risks. 

Moreover, the importance of safety is 

emphasised during engagements with third 

party service providers. In our development 

projects, weekly health and safety meetings 

are conducted by the main contractor along 

with Heeton’s project manager. We also 

conduct regular site visits to ensure that our 

main contractor is complying with all health 

and safety requirements. Corrective actions 

are enforced for any on-site safety concerns.  

In FY2018, no Heeton employees suffered 

workplace fatalities. Neither were there any 

incidents of non-compliance with regulations 

or voluntary codes concerning the health and 

safety impacts of our managed developments.  

Going forward, Heeton will stay committed to 

promoting occupational and customer health 

and safety, preventing non-compliance, and 

maintaining 

zero 

fatalities 

among 

our 

employees and other users of our buildings.

 Heeton Holdings Limited Sustainability Report FY2018 

OUR IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT  

GRI 102-11 

Both the real estate and the hospitality 

sectors are high consumers of resources, such 

as energy and water. Heeton recognises that 

we should not delay taking appropriate 

actions to reduce our environmental impact.  

In this respect, we have already adopted 

green 

practices 

to 

improve 

resource 

efficiency. These include energy and water 

usage reduction measures, such as LED 

lighting, motion-sensor light switches and 

water efficient practices and equipment, 

which have been installed at our properties 

and hotels.   

Monthly reports on energy and water 

consumption at our investment properties are 

reviewed by our management to detect any 

irregularities and take appropriate actions.  

At our hotels, tracking of energy and water 

consumption is done via an online tool to 

ensure the efficiency of the implemented 

resource conservation measures. 

We promote environmental awareness 

among our employees and tenants through e-

mails on best practices to help reduce their 

environmental footprint at work.

ENERGY AND EMISSIONS3 

GRI 302-1, 302-3, 305-2 

In FY2018, our total energy consumption in Singapore was 28,769 GJ or 7,991,247 kWh, consisting of 

7,911,995 kWh of electricity consumed by our two managed investment properties and 79,252 kWh 

electricity consumed by our headquarters. During the same period, our six managed hotels in the UK 

consumed 19,682 GJ of energy in total, including 1,303,873 kWh of electricity and 371,797 m3 of 

natural gas.  

ENERGY CONSUMPTION (GLOBAL - FY2018) 

 

 

3 Energy and GHG emissions figures are compiled using the latest Singapore’s grid emission factors published 

by Energy Market Authority and relevant conversion factors from the UK Government’s DEFRA (Department 

for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs).

amounted to 761  tCO2e (tonnes of CO2 equivalent), while scope 2 emissions5 generated from our 

overall electricity consumption were 3,719  tCO2e, representing a total of 4,480  tCO2e. 

In FY2018, the average electricity intensity of our two investment properties in Singapore was 276.5 

kWh (1.0 GJ) per square meter (m2) of floor area, corresponding to an emissions intensity of 0.12 

tCO2e/m2.

WATER 

GRI 303-1, 303-2, 303-3 

Of a total of 108,791 cubic meters (m3) of water consumed by our properties in FY2018, our UK 

hotels used 27,3756 m3, while our two investment properties and headquarters in Singapore used 

81,165 m3 and 251 m3 respectively. The water intensity of the investment properties was 2.84 m3 per 

m2 of floor area in FY2018. We aim to maintain current energy and water intensity in FY2020. 

Our investment properties and office headquarters in Singapore withdraw water from public 

networks and all used water is disposed back through the city’s sewerage system, where it is treated 

and recycled according to local regulations. No used water is discharge directly into the 

environment.  

WATER USAGE (GLOBAL - FY2018) 

 

 

 

4 Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions of GHG produced from sources that are owned or controlled by an 

organisation. 

5 Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions of GHG produced from the consumption of purchased electricity.
