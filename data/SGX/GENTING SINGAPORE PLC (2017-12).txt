TABLE OF CONTENT

MESSAGE FROM OUR PRESIDENT

message from our president

Dear Stakeholders, 

2017 was an eventful year with 

geopolitical events leading to 

pockets of uncertainty around the 

world. The US officially notified that  

it will withdraw from the Paris 

Climate Agreement, resulting 

in a partial setback to global 

environmental initiatives.

During the year, Singapore 

reaffirmed its commitment to the 

Paris Climate Agreement and its 

pledge on emissions. As part of the 

global climate accord, Singapore 

will reduce the country’s overall 

energy intensity by 36% by 2030. 

The Singapore Government also 

announced plans for a carbon tax in 

2019 and increased water price by 

30% since July 2017. 

We are aligned to the national 

commitment to combat climate 

change. Our conservation initiatives 

are on track to achieve our targets of 

cumulative energy and water savings 

of 63% and 15%, respectively, by 

2020. This year, grid electricity 

consumption compared to 2016 

has fallen by 4%, while fresh water 

consumption saw a good reduction 

of approximately 8%. New efforts in 

the year also led to a 9% reduction 

in waste production and an increase 

of nearly 25% in the use of recycled 

materials. As a testament to our 

good environmental practices, RWS’ 

Hard Rock Hotel received the Award 

of Excellence at the Singapore Green 

Hotel Award 2017-2018.

Through our corporate social 

responsibility (CSR) platform  

known as RWS Cares, we 

contributed to and enabled more 

than $6.2 million in cash and in-

kind donations to various charities 

and organisations that are aligned 

with our corporate philosophies 

of community empowerment, 

engagement and environmental 

conservation. As children and 

seniors are key focus in our CSR 

outreach, 93% of all donations 

went towards children, youth and 

elders-related causes in 2017. As 

part of RWS’ five-year commitment 

of $5 million in corporate giving 

to Community Chest, Universal 

Studios Singapore hosted the 

second edition of Community Chest 

Charity in the Park in February 2017. 

Bringing together more than 4,000 

donors, beneficiaries, caregivers 

and volunteers, this event raised 

over $2 million benefitting charities 

supported by Community Chest. For 

these efforts, RWS was recognised 

with the Corporate Platinum Award in 

the 2017 Community Chest Awards. 

This is the second year we are 

executing on our Sustainability21 

Strategy and our fourth 

comprehensive sustainability report 

in accordance with Global 

Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 

guidelines. The results thus 

far are most encouraging. 

Since our inclusion as one 

of the pioneering companies 

on the Singapore Exchange 

Sustainability Indices in 

2016, we are now one of the 

top 10 constituents of the 

SGX Sustainability Leaders 

Index and SGX Sustainability 

Leaders Enhanced Index. 

I would like to express my gratitude 

to our partners, stakeholders and 

team members who have joined us 

in our sustainability journey. We look 

forward to your continued partnership, 

support and engagement as we travel 

to achieve new milestones. 

– Tan Hee Teck,  

President and Chief Executive Officer

2017 marks the second year since we launched our 

Sustainability21 Strategy and we are starting to see 

good results towards achieving national and international 

sustainability goals. 

Our Sustainability21 Strategy is built on 4 key pillars: 

Marketplace, People, Community and Environment, 

which helps the Board and senior management focus on 

developing policies and practices, setting performance 

targets and action plans, in order to create sustainable 

value for all stakeholders. 

During the year, the Board maintained oversight over 

the Sustainability Working Committee and Sustainability 

Steering Committee, managing sustainability risks and 

opportunities, while ensuring all Environment, Social and 

Governance (ESG) matters significant to our business are 

aligned with our Sustainability21 Strategy.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

SUSTAINABILITY21 STRATEGY

1 The CSR contributions for 2017 included cash and in-kind donations from RWS and cash donations raised from RWS sponsored events such as 

ChildAid and Community Chest Charity in the Park.

In order to achieve our brand leadership as a world-class sustainable 

integrated resort, we analysed our operations across the value chain 

and identified key Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks and 

opportunities. We have studied four of these key ESG risks and their potential 

impacts to gain a comprehensive overview of mitigation approaches and how 

we could turn them into opportunities (Table 1).

WHAT IS OUR KEY ESG RISK?

WHERE ARE THE ESG OPPORTUNITIES?

PUBLIC HEALTH 

HAZARDS

Health hazards can arise from 

seasonal haze, mosquito-borne 

diseases, and flu pandemics, which 

may lead to a fall in visitor numbers.

In staying ahead in the MARKETPLACE 

through achieving high standards of not just 

safety but business conduct.

(See how we tackle this under “Guest Safety and 

Health”, and “Workplace Safety and Health”.)

HEALTH AND SAFETY OF 

MARINE ANIMALS

Marine animals in our care might 

be exposed to disease outbreaks 

and this has regulatory and social 

implications to our business.

In conserving and protecting our 

ENVIRONMENT by providing a healthy and 

comfortable living condition for all marine 

animals under our care.

(See how we tackle this under “Biodiversity”.

SAFETY OF GUESTS AND 

TEAM MEMBERS

Accidents that might occur from the 

use of our facilities.

In creating safe and enjoyable environment 

for PEOPLE to work and play in.

(See how we tackle this under “Emergency 

Preparedness” and “Workplace Safety and Health”.)

 

 

PROBLEM GAMBLING

Societal harm might arise from 

problem gambling at our casino 

premises and such incidents might 

lead to sanctions from authorities 

and reputational damages.

In preventing problem gambling 

through exercising suitable controls 

and programmes within our premises 

to contribute to our responsibility 

to the COMMUNITY.

(See how we tackle this under “Compliance” and 

“Responsible Gaming”.)

In response to the key ESG risks identified, we developed our Sustainability21 Strategy in 2016, which is made up of 

four main pillars (Table 2). Our five-year Sustainability21 Strategy framework is also in line with national and international 

commitments and serves as our roadmap to how we operate and run our business. While we continue to maintain our 

performance in areas we have excelled in, our strategy also aims to set targets and action plans for improvement to bring 

us closer to achieving sustainable growth by 2020.

REPORTING STANDARDS

This report has been prepared in accordance with the Singapore Exchange’s 

(SGX) “Comply or Explain” requirements for sustainability reporting. We have 

chosen to adopt the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 sustainability reporting 

framework – “Comprehensive” option, due to its internationally-recognised, 

robust guidance and universal application, allowing for comparability of our 

performance across sectors and geographies. We plan to transition to the new 

GRI Standards in the next year. The relevant references may be found in our

Directors. We also ensure our compliance to all relevant local and international 

laws and regulations, including the principles and guidelines set out in the

2. ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT (ERM)

We are committed to managing our operational risks to safeguard our assets and create a long-

term value for stakeholders through a robust ERM framework. Our ERM framework is based on 

the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited Listing Rule 1207(10) and Singapore Code of 

Corporate Governance 2012 Principle 11. Its objective is out in Figure 7.

5. ENTERTAINMENT 

AND GIFTS POLICY 

AND WHISTLE-

BLOWING POLICIES

To manage our fraud risks, we have a 

robust internal control system, which 

includes Whistle-Blowing Policy and 

Entertainment and Gifts Policy. In 

order to promote responsible and 

secure whistleblowing, we have 

whistle-blower hotline and email 

channels6 which are accessible 

throughout the year by all team 

members and external parties.

In 2017, we have received 27 

reports through our whistleblowing 

channel most of which were 

relating to employee grievances 

and customer feedback. No serious 

irregularities such as fraud or 

breaches of corporate governance 

were reported. All reports have 

been investigated and resolved.

3. APPROACH 

TOWARDS ANTI-

COMPETITIVE 

BEHAVIOUR

We are strictly against and do not take 

part in any anti-competitive behaviour. 

This includes activities that prevent, 

restrict, or distort competition within 

Singapore. Our commitment for 

zero tolerance for such behaviour 

is clearly demonstrated in our 

performance in Figure 8.

4. PREVENTION OF MONEY LAUNDERING 

AND TERRORISM FINANCING (PMLTF) 

FRAMEWORK

In line with the Board’s commitment to prevent money laundering and 

terrorism financing and to be in compliance with the Casino Control Act PMLTF 

Regulation 2010, we have established a PMLTF Committee, comprising of 

Senior Management, to oversee the PMLTF framework (Figure 9). The PMLTF 

framework is reviewed and updated on an annual basis by the Board. 

In addition, internal policies and standard operating procedures have 

been established to provide guidance to the team members on the PMLTF 

framework which are also communicated during the orientation and annual 

refresher trainings through appointed PMLTF officers.

The ERM framework is reviewed and endorsed by the 

Risk Management Committee (RMC) to ensure that 

the business objectives and strategies are aligned with 

the risk profile of Genting Singapore. Our RMC, which 

comprises of Senior Management, reports to the Audit 

and Risk Committee and Board of Directors every quarter 

on all risk management matters, playing a pivotal role 

in providing management action and direction on risk 

matters. Please refer to our Annual Report 2017 for more

COMPLIANCE 

We believe that adhering to our Company’s codes, policies and procedures 

and applicable laws and regulations is a critical behaviour as they underpin 

our stakeholders’ trust and our license to operate. We have zero tolerance of 

non-compliance and encourage our stakeholders to report any incidences of 

non-compliance through our whistleblower and internal reporting channels. 

All incidences of non-compliance brought to attention are compulsorily 

investigated and addressed by our compliance and/or legal team.

In 2017, there were two cases of fines by the Casino Regulatory Authority (CRA) 

relating to the casino business for two cases involving four minors who were 

permitted to enter or remain on casino premises of RWS without reasonable 

excuse. This was a drop from the previous year, which saw three incidences 

of fines including one similar case relating to minors being permitted to enter 

the casino area. We will strive to continue to improve on our compliance 

performance and work towards achieving zero non-compliance cases next year. 

We are proud to report that we have maintained our track record of zero 

confirmed incidences related to corruption since 2016 and we will strive to 

maintain this unblemished record (Table 4).

Based on the results of our in-house surveys and CSISG scores, our attractions have seen improvements in guest 

satisfaction levels with the exception of Universal Studios Singapore. Universal Studios Singapore experienced a slight 

dip of less than 1% in guest satisfaction levels while ACW’s guest satisfaction levels improved substantially by about 6% 

as compared to last year. We aim to continue to improve our service quality based on the feedback and scores gathered

business units, including 

Attractions, Hotels and F&amp;B 

to share best practices 

among team members.

GUEST 

SATISFACTION

We believe the quality of our operations drives levels of guest satisfaction. 

Satisfied guests serve as a barometer of our success in providing a world-class 

service experience. Besides tracking our guest satisfaction scores against the 

Customer Satisfaction Index of Singapore (CSISG)10, industry average, we conduct 

in-house surveys to gather feedback about guest experiences based on our 

survey methodology (Table 8).

In this year, we commenced conducting internal audits on attractions through 

thorough inspection of the attractions’ service and efficiency. This has provided 

a more in-depth reflection of guest experience and our service quality, helping us 

to understand how we can better serve our guests.

However, housekeeping was prompt and fast.”

- A guest from Singapore

“ Waiting time was too long and the rides are a little repetitive.”

- A guest from Singapore

“ There are not as many rides as we have expected. ACW did 

not have enough inflatable pool rings which made us walk a

“ Underwhelming experience, too crowded and little exhibitions.”

- A guest from Singapore

“ In my opinion, the hotel was very good and nice. Also, the 

hotel employees were very accommodating but it was hard 

to understand what they were saying as they often spoke 

too fast for tourists like me to understand. Although I had to 

communicate via body language to understand each other at 

times, I am impressed that they can speak English.”

Our commitment for sustainable procurement is demonstrated through the identification of operational categories 

that would bring about the most business impact to Genting Singapore, the communities and the environment that we 

operate in. We have set up cross-category teams to champion sustainable procurement in top ten categories that are of 

material impact to us and focused on the following key sustainable value drivers:

1. SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT

Procurement at Genting Singapore spans across a wide array of products and services to support the attractions, hotels 

and F&amp;B outlets, and casino operations. We encourage local procurement opportunities and our concerted effort of 

supporting local businesses has resulted in 85% of our suppliers now being from Singapore (Figure 16).

2. SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS PRACTICES

Our tender management committee ensures that all our suppliers engaged 

by Genting Singapore are selected through a fair and ethical tendering 

process. We abide by a rigorous set of criteria for evaluation of all potential 

suppliers. The criteria provide guidance on assessing the potential 

suppliers based on but not limited to price, quality, track record, technical 

competency, financial stability, service support and sustainability initiatives. 

All high value tenders involving more than S$200,000 are conducted through 

electronic tender submission. We continue to adopt the e-tender submission 

process through the two-envelope system for enhanced efficiency, security, 

transparency and equality of treatment across the suppliers. 

We adopt fair payment terms with all 

suppliers as part of our commitment 

to advocate good business ethics 

and in support of local Small and 

Medium Enterprises where  

more than 97% of our payments 

are made within 30 days.

3. SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT

We aim to work with suppliers who share similar business values as us by adopting a strategic Supplier Code of Conduct 

which sets out our expectations across four dimensions, namely:

Recognising our impact on the environment from our inception,  

we continue to seek improvement in our environmental efforts through 

building a sustainable business environment. 

ENERGY AND EMISSIONS

As the largest integrated resort destination in Singapore, we are cognizant 

of the significant environmental impact of our operations, as well as the 

contribution we could make in reducing our environmental footprint. In support 

of Singapore’s recent reaffirmation of its 2015 Paris Agreement commitment to 

reduce the nation’s overall energy intensity level by 36%16 by 2030, we continue 

to align ourselves to the national commitment to combat climate change. 

At Genting Singapore, our Facilities Management &amp; Engineering (FM&amp;E) 

team oversees our energy use by setting targets, tracking, monitoring 

and auditing our energy efficiency on a monthly basis (Table 12).

16 Source: Carbon Brief, Tracking Country Climate Pledges.

17 2013 is selected as the baseline year.

18 The direct energy consumption level for 2016 has been restated as 51.2 TJ from 47.2 TJ in reflection of minor human error. We are constantly reviewing 

our reporting and monitoring procedures and are always aiming to achieve zero human error to provide accurate data and information to our stakeholders.

19 The upstream and downstream energy consumption activities relevant to Genting Singapore is identified in Figure 20 and 23.

20 We are continually updating our methodologies to measure our carbon footprint. Our restatement for 2016 for Scope 3 related emissions relates to 

employees commuting.

FOSSIL FUEL USE (I.E. DIRECT ENERGY USE)

• 96% of our energy consumption arising from fossil fuels was natural gas, 

sourced from City Gas, which is mainly used for kitchen activities and the 

Universal Studios Singapore rides. The remaining fossil fuel use arose 

from diesel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and motor gasoline to support 

operations of boomlifts, WaterWorld Jetskis and buggies (Figure 18 and 21). 

• In 2017, the use of fossil fuel remained relatively stable at 50.6 TJ18. 

GRID ELECTRICITY USE (I.E. INDIRECT ENERGY USE)

• Grid electricity use has fallen by about 4% this year. (Figure 19 and 22),  

as a result of various energy reduction initiatives (Table 13).

ENERGY USE ARISING FROM UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM TRANSPORTATION ACTIVITIES

• Energy consumption and intensity arising from upstream and downstream 

transportation activities19 has remained relatively stable over the past few 

years (Figure 20 and 23)20.

WATER

Water is a scarce and precious resource in Singapore. 

At the same time, it is a critical resource for our 

operations, especially in our water-based attractions 

such as Adventure Cove Waterpark (ACW). The 

freshwater consumed at Genting Singapore is sourced 

from the Public Utilities Board (PUB), a small portion 

of which is NEWater, a high-grade reclaimed water.

Genting Singapore also substantially relies on the use of 

seawater. An estimated amount of 60 million litres is drawn 

from Keppel Harbour which is filtered through an Ocean 

Water Supply (OWS) system to support our operations 

at S.E.A. Aquarium (S.E.A.A.) where water remains the 

basic necessity for the survival of our marine animals.

We balance the competing needs of our business 

operations with the needs of the Singapore 

community, by seeking to continuously improve 

our use of water through various initiatives.

Our freshwater consumption has fallen by around 8% this year (Figure 25). 

This was achieved through a number of initiatives such as:

• Collecting rainwater for specific uses24

• Improving the water top-up control method at Adventure River in ACW to 

reduce overflow losses

• Cooling tower blowdown water recovery 

We plan to implement regiment of water use monitoring to detect abnormal 

usage patterns by respective business unit weekly.

In 2017, RWS Green Committee explored a 3R initiative 

to re-use clothes and linens generated from hotels 

and wardrobe. By doing so, 7 tons of waste was re-

used and diverted from disposal. During the end of 

the year, the committee organised an inter-business 

unit Upcycling Competition to promote such initiatives 

and encourage our team members to donate their 

re-useable clothes and linens from home. The clothes 

were sent to South West Community Development 

Council, where they were upcycled into curtains and 

carpets in overseas factories. The competition was well 

received, with participation from 10 major business 

units and collection of more than 1,140 kilogrammes of 

clothes and linen which were converted to about 380 

kilogrammes of rice for needy families in the district.

EFFLUENTS AND WASTE

The effluents and waste produced in Singapore has increased significantly in the past 

years. Land availability in Singapore is a serious constraint and our only landfill at 

Semakau is due to fill up by 2035 at current rates of waste disposal and filling. With the 

additional recent scrutiny on food waste, Genting Singapore is acutely sensitive to the 

urgency of tackling the nation’s waste management challenge and to achieve Singapore’s 

goal of becoming a zero-waste nation.

Our waste management system monitors and categorises our waste by type and disposal 

methods in accordance with the National Environmental Agency (NEA) requirements.

At Genting Singapore, some of our operations especially 

at the S.E.A.A. require the handling of some hazardous 

substances, which when disposed, could potentially 

be detrimental to health and the environment. Hence 

we ensure these hazardous effluents and wastes are 

disposed through certified26 and licensed vendors. This 

year, we have engaged a new vendor who is NEA certified 

to replace the prior vendor undergoing recovery from the 

recent fire breakout at their plant.

In addition, our team members are trained to identify any

and sealed bags or containers and stored in areas with 

restricted access, until the collection by our vendors.

In 2017, the hazardous waste disposed reduced 

significantly (Table 16). Ever since Marine Aquaculture 

and Research Centre (MARC) was relocated to RWS 

early this year, there was less chemicals required 

as the operations were streamlined. Although there 

is no target set for hazardous waste reduction due 

to insignificant amount generated, we continue to 

further reduce overall hazardous waste disposal 

through careful acquisition and process.

26 We require our vendors to be either ISO14001, OHSAS 18001 or Biz Safe Star Level certified.

27 We do not have break down of expired medicine separately from the biological waste as the new vendor, Cramoil Singapore Pte Ltd, which replaced our 

prior vendor, ECO Special Waste Management, does not categorically separate the expired medication from other hazardous waste types.

Our robust food waste management practices at our resort 

includes a bio-digester installation that converts food 

waste into liquid waste as well as conversion of coffee 

grounds, tea leaves and compost into garden mulch for 

fertiliser use. Our efforts have been recognised with our 

first ever Foodprints @ South West certification in 2017.

We catered for enhancement of 

landscape with the planting of 

species such as Cyrtophyllum 

fragrans (Tembusu) and Muntinga 

calabura (Cherry trees)28.

To grow the number of native plant 

species through increasing.

Table 17: Land biodiversity conservation performance

Table 18: Marine biodiversity conservation performance

28 Please see http://seaa.rwsentosablog.com/iucn-red-list for the Native plant species list.  

Additionally, we maintain a variety of native plants around 

RWS as we believe native plants are an important symbol 

of Singapore’s cultural and natural heritage. Native flora 

will provide food and shelter to native fauna, which is key 

to maintaining a healthy ecosystem. We conduct annual 

surveys to record the plant, bird and marine species 

sighted in our area, as diversity of these species is a good 

indicator of biodiversity conservation and habitat quality. 

Our strong commitment towards biodiversity has led us to 

achieve the following goals for greater biodiversity (Table 

17 and 18).

29 For targets relating to marine biodiversity conservation, please see Advocacy section in this report. 

30 This figure only includes species that are Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN) and Vulnerable (VU) which are the top most vulnerable species on 

the IUCN Red List.

31 This figure only includes species that are under Appendix I and II lists which list species that are most endangered among CITES-listed animals and 

plants and species that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so unless trade is closely controlled respectively.

For the full lists of marine species on the IUCN Red List, and the CITES I or II lists, please refer to http://seaa.rwsentosablog.com/iucn-red-list.

Preserving biodiversity is of critical importance to us especially since the area  

occupied by RWS spans 2.9 ha of secondary coastal forest; besides, hosting an 

independent ecosystem of more than 100,000 animals ranging over 1,000 species  

under S.E.A.A.’s care

At our core, we abide by three biodiversity conservation 

guiding principles and our management approach 

(Table 20 and 21), as we take greater responsibilities in 

conserving the fauna and flora surrounding us:

1. Adopt sustainable husbandry practices when 

acquiring animals and their food sources.

2. Protect animals in their natural environment 

to conserve global biodiversity.

3. Inspire the public to protect the oceans 

through interactive education (see Advocacy 

section later in this report for more details).

Among plants and animals under our care, several 

species have been listed under national and international 

conservation lists for their vulnerable status (Table 19):

CAREFUL COLLECTION PLANNING

At Genting Singapore, our Curatorial team is always trying and looking for better ways of collection planning which 

includes acquisition. The evaluation and update of our collection plan is conducted by the Managers and take the 

Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ (AZA) Animal Program Standards into consideration.

Criteria for inclusion includes the status of the species in the wild, its suitability to be living in our facilities, and value 

for educating the public.

Part of the collection planning process involves registering the species with AZA Taxon Advisory Groups to provide 

habitats for our animals that are closest to their natural habitats.

SUSTAINABLE FISH SOURCES

As an AZA accredited body, we ensure best practices in sustainable sourcing of fishes and do not participate in 

unsustainable fishing methods such as dynamite fishing or chemical fishing.

We acquire fish only from sustainable sources with international certifications such as Marine Stewardship 

Council (MSC), Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) and Friend of the Sea (FOS). For Dolphin Island we only 

purchase from a regulated Canadian fishery or US fish and wildlife vendors. 47% of S.E.A.A.’s feed purchases were 

sustainable.

MONITORING OUR ANIMALS’ HEALTH AND SAFETY

Our animals are given the highest quality of care whereby we conduct periodic veterinary and husbandry checks on 

them which is supported by our veterinary laboratories.

This includes complete blood cell counts, blood chemistries, cytology and microbiology, and other advanced 

diagnostics such as hormone analysis, ultrasound, digital X-ray, and endoscopy.

We monitor the safety of their surroundings by checking the quality of air and water where our in-house water quality 

laboratory takes up to 950 water samples and runs over 3,000 tests a week. 

Other checks include routine monitoring of the soil, air and precipitation for microbial content and chemical composition.

INTER-INSTITUTIONAL EXCHANGE

We share knowledge and best practices on veterinary and husbandry techniques with other aquariums.

Table 20: Genting Singapore’s approach to land biodiversity conservation

Table 21: Genting Singapore’s approach to marine biodiversity conservation

LAND

USING COMPOST TO ENRICH THE SOIL AND ORGANIC PESTICIDES TO BIOLOGICALLY CONTROL PLANT PEST AND DISEASES

Apply compost, spent coffee grounds and tea leaves recycled from our food outlets as organic mulch for the plants.

Increase the use of bio-stimulants such as sea weeds extract, humic or fulvic acids and protein hydrolysates to 

promote plant growth and reduce the use of inorganic chemical fertilisers.

Manage the ecological balance by gradually switching to biological control using organic pesticides derived from 

plants such as neem oil and citronella oil or from bacteria like the Bacillus thuringienis (a bacterium which is toxic to 

many insects). This is to reduce our dependency on the harmful toxic chemicals and protect the beneficial predators 

and the soil from toxic contaminants.

PROTECTING TREES AGAINST DAMAGE

We protect our forest with a perimeter hoarding during construction to reduce the impact of spillover activities.

Large trees of botanical importance are installed with lightning arresters to prevent damage from lightning.

During maintenance rounds, trees are also checked for visual pest and disease infestation as well as the tree structure.

Corrective treatment is applied, when required, to safeguard the trees and mitigate potential safety hazards.

MONITORING OUR TREES’ HEALTH AND SAFETY

We conduct weekly checks on our trees and palms to ensure they are free from pest and disease infestation and are 

growing normally.

Corrective treatments or pruning are done when required, to mitigate any potential safety hazards.

Weak and unsound trees or palms beyond rescue are removed.

Trees in the secondary forests are checked quarterly which includes pest and disease infestation. Treatment is only 

applied when required to maintain the ecological balance in the forests.

INTEGRATED DESIGN WITH NATURE

We integrate nature into the resort development with green roofs, green walls and lush planting around  

high rise buildings.

Suitable and healthy trees are salvaged from sites before construction/expansion, and replanted upon  

completion of works.

Total green spaces occupy 27% of the resort32.

In December 2017, one of the world’s 

rarest rays, the ornate eagle ray, 

(Aetomylaeus vespertilio), made its 

debut at S.E.A. Aquarium in RWS. It 

arrived from Cairns Marine, a WAZA-

Member33 which provides fish, corals 

and ongoing care to aquariums 

around the world. The ornate eagle 

ray is found in the Western and 

Eastern Indian Ocean, and the 

Northwest and Western Central 

Pacific Ocean. They are commonly 

seen cruising along sandy beaches 

in shallow waters. 

This endangered species is the first 

of its kind to be featured in zoos and 

aquariums worldwide. 

It is a shy sea creature known for 

its distinct pattern of reticulate dark 

lines and rings on its back, together 

with its whip-like tail, the ray can 

measure up to 5m, with a wing 

span of up to 240cm. Eagle rays are 

generally large rays with wing-like 

pectoral fins. The whip-like tail of 

Case study: One of the World’s Rarest Rays Debuts at S.E.A. Aquarium

an ornate eagle ray can grow longer 

than its wing span. Rays usually have 

a stinging barb on the tail, but the 

ornate eagle ray is not equipped with 

one. It possesses extremely hard 

teeth to crush through the shells of 

snails, mussels and crustaceans. 

This species is viviparous, giving 

birth to four to six live young. This 

iconic species is amongst the 

newest residents at Shipwreck 

Habitat, along with other threatened 

species such as the shark ray, green 

sea turtle and hawksbill turtle. 

Mr Jason Horkin, Senior Vice 

President of Attractions, Resorts 

World Sentosa, said, “The ornate 

eagle ray is indeed an extremely rare 

and precious wonder in our marine 

life collection. We are pleased it 

has settled in comfortably at S.E.A. 

Aquarium and has even responded 

positively to the aquarist and its 

new environment. There’s so much 

to learn about this extremely rare 

species: little is known about 

the ornate eagle ray and we plan 

to study as much as we can to 

broaden our scientific knowledge 

and understanding and further 

contribute to the conservation of 

this rare beauty. In the long run, we 

hope to collaborate with reputable 

institutions to introduce females 

to our male ray to kickstart the 

world’s first conservation breeding 

programme for this species under 

human care.”

The ornate eagle ray is listed as 

“Endangered” in the IUCN* Red List 

of Threatened Species. The main 

threat to the species is accidental 

capture by fishermen in the waters of 

Australia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, 

Maldives, Taiwan and Thailand. 

In addition, the species has a low 

reproduction rate.

Our 2017 resignation rate dropped 

to 15.7% compared to 17.3% 

in 2016. This is lower than the 

industry average. During the year, 

we also hired over 1,300 new team 

members based on their expertise 

and availability of roles across our 

business units (Figure 30).

Whether in recruitment or dismissal, 

we do not discriminate on the basis 

of race, age, gender, religion or 

nationality. In the unfortunate event 

that a team member feels he/she has 

been unfairly treated, our Grievance 

Handling Procedure (see Figure 31) 

provides a confidential and objective 

platform to seek consultation and 

resolution. In 2017, there were no 

reported grievances on labour 

practices and human rights through 

this process.

Within two weeks of incident, team members are encouraged to report directly 

to their immediate supervisor. If the case involves their direct supervisor, team 

members should report directly to the Head of Department.

GRIEVANCE HANDLING PROCEDURE

If matter is unresolved within two weeks from the date of the report or if 

the grievance is against immediate supervisor, the team member should 

surface the matter in writing to the Head of Department, who shall resolve the 

grievance within two weeks.

If the team member is still aggrieved, the matter may be raised to the Human 

Resource Relationship Manager, who shall review and arbitrate the matter with 

the Head of Human Resources within one week.

If the matter is not resolved satisfactorily, it shall be dealt with by the 

Chief Executive Officer within one week, and his decision shall be final.

TEAM MEMBER WELLNESS

We believe that health and happiness of team members is 

highly correlated to their productivity at work. 

Therefore, we provide wellness related benefits in support 

of the health of our team members and their families 

include life insurance, group hospitalisation and surgical 

care, where expenses incurred as a result of hospitalisation 

is reimbursed, and group term life, which provides 

coverage against death and total permanent disability.

Parental leave such as maternity leave, paternity leave 

and shared parental leave are also available and spelt out 

clearly in our leave policy. In 2017, out of 1,601 female and 

2,264 male team members who were entitled to parental 

leave, 169 women and 189 men enjoyed maternity leave 

and paternity leave or shared parental leave, respectively, 

and about 90% of them returned to continue their career 

journey with us. 

We also provide additional corporate benefits to our team 

members, such as discounted tickets to attractions for 

team members and their families to enjoy. Occasionally, 

team events such as the Health and Wellness Week 

and Health and Wellness Festival are held to show our 

appreciation to team members and to improve employee 

wellness holistically.

Health and Wellness Week – We arranged on-site free 

health screening in the resort and Genting Centre for our 

team members.

Case study: Internal WSH-Novation project : Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase ride vehicle brake release

This year, our Technical Services team designed a brake 

release modification. Before this, two team members 

were required to climb up the ride vehicle on both sides of 

Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase ride with full body 

harness to release the motor brakes manually in order 

to push the ride vehicle in case of ride vehicle faulted in 

the ride track. Since the new ride vehicle brake release, 

it has allowed our team members to electrically release 

the brake mechanism without having to climb up onto the 

vehicle during ride vehicle recovery, thus eliminating the 

risk of team members falling from height.

We are committed to make RWS a safe workplace 

with a healthy workforce together with our Safety 

Committees, which are comprised of 164 representatives 

from key business units, as well as our Safety and 

Emergency Planning team (Figure 34). The committees 

are responsible for managing WSH system and holds 

a monthly meeting to ensure the management of WSH 

across our business units.

At Genting Singapore, we are mindful of our performers’ 

safety and health. Following a heightened injury rate 

of our performers last year, an observation program 

was conducted for shows such as Rockafellas show at 

Universal Studios Singapore. Peers and Supervisor for the 

show held sessions to review video clips of performances 

and share their comments to the performers in the clips 

on what was observed. To keep the performers in the 

right physique to perform, a mandatory 45 minutes of 

intensive warm-ups have been put in place before each 

first show of each day.

In 2017, our Accident Frequency Rate (AFR), Accident 

Severity Rate (ASR), number of man days lost and number 

of lost-day incidents fell as compared to 2016. Overall, 

our number of man days lost has drastically decreased 

from last year. We believe this is due to the relevant action 

plans put up to prevent reoccurrence. Similarly, our lost 

days incidents waned, helping us to surpass both man 

days lost and loss day incidents reduction targets of 5% 

(Figure 32).

Common types of injuries remained similar to last 

year which includes slips &amp; trips, cuts and strenuous 

movements (Table 27). Due to the nature of their work, our 

kitchen, attractions and performing team members are 

more prone to abovementioned injuries. We protect our 

performers and F&amp;B staff by means of:

36 We are constantly updating our safety data to measure the man days lost and lost day incidents as accurately as possible. The difference observed for 

2016 is due to late reporting of incidents by business units. Our restatement for 2016 reflects a true and fair statement of our team members’ workplace 

injuries at Genting Singapore.

During the year, Genting Singapore 

either contributed to or enabled, 

more than S$6.2 million38 in cash 

and in-kind donations to various 

charity organisations in Singapore. 

93% of our donations went toward 

children, youth and elderly causes in 

2017. Conferred with the Corporate 

Platinum Award in 2017 by the 

Community Chest, we were further 

encouraged to go beyond and 

reached out to more than 48,000 

people this year. Our CSR outreach 

continues to focus its efforts on 

children, youth and the elderly, who 

are also defined as vulnerable groups 

by the World Health Organisation.

To further strengthen our 

volunteerism spirit, we launched our 

first ever one-day Volunteer Leave 

which our team members can utilise 

from 2017, over and above their 

annual leave, to take part in CSR 

events organised or endorsed by 

RWS Cares.

We continue to stay engaged with the communities around us through our sustained efforts (Table 28) not only 

through philanthropic activities but environmental conservation and education (more details found in Advocacy 

section of this report)39.

Table 28: CSR outreach achievements 

We held our very first aRWSome Volunteer Day in April 2017 in partnership with South West Community Development 

Council where a record number of volunteers, comprising more than 240 senior management and team members, rolled 

up their sleeves to refurbish and spruce up over 30 one- and two-bedroom rental homes of low income residents in 

Clementi. Ahead of the event, our volunteers also spent time visiting and befriending the residents to understand their 

needs and living conditions, bringing on-board experts from our Facilities Management and Engineering department to 

support with technical repair works.

“I thank RWS for all the help – during 

aRWSome Volunteer Day – where 

their staff volunteers came to spruce 

up my home and introduced me 

to a job, guiding me onto the right 

path. RWS has been a great place 

to work, as my colleagues have 

been very understanding. I also feel 

empowered and happy to have this 

stable job so that I can continue to 

support my family” – Mr Isthreeramu, 

Clementi resident who secured a job 

as butler at the Beach Villas in RWS.

Christmas came early for 440 underprivileged children from the South 

West District during our annual aRWSome Wishes held at Universal 

Studios Singapore. They were the first in Singapore to witness the dazzling 

light-up of A Universal Christmas at the theme park and also received 

Christmas presents they wished for, from the generous contributions of our 

team members. More than 150 aRWSome volunteers comprising senior 

management and team members shared festive cheer with them at this 

event. Guests also played their part for charity where for every online ticket 

purchase to A Universal Christmas, RWS pledged S$10 to Community 

Chest. The aRWSome Wishes Charity Drive successfully raised S$300,000.

Genting Singapore also took part 

in South West District’s Clean Up 

South West!, the district’s annual 

trash-for-groceries recycling 

programme. We contributed 

more than 1,140 kilogrammes of 

old clothing and linen through 

an internal recycling competition 

to be converted into about 380 

kilogrammes of rice for needy 

families in the district.

RWS continued to be Official Venue Partner for the 13th edition of ChildAid in 

November 2017, a long-running children’s charity concert, which raised more 

than S$2.1 million to benefit children from The Straits Times School Pocket 

Money Fund and The Business Times Budding Artists Fund.

In November 2017, Genting 

Singapore sponsored four clients 

of SPD (formerly known as Society 

for the Physically Disabled) to 

participate in our first ever disabled 

diving programme at the S.E.A.A.. 

After becoming the first and only 

organisation in Singapore to be 

accredited by Disabled Divers 

International to train instructors and 

conduct recreational dives for the 

disabled, we provided a rare and 

valuable opportunity for the disabled 

community to experience the joy of 

diving in a safe environment under 

the supervision of dive instructors.

For the seventh consecutive year, 

we participated in the global Earth 

Hour movement on 25 March 2017 

by dimming non-essential lightings 

across the resort for one hour and 

encouraging everyone to play a part.

As part of RWS’ five-year commitment of S$5 million in corporate giving to 

Community Chest, Universal Studios Singapore hosted the second edition 

of Community Chest Charity in the Park in February 2017. Bringing together 

more than 4,000 donors, beneficiaries, caregivers and volunteers for an 

evening of food and fun, the event not only raised over S$2 million benefitting 

charities supported by Community Chest but also encouraged greater 

understanding of people with disabilities.

In February 2017, we hosted elderly residents from AWWA Senior Community 

Home to a celebratory Lunar New Year dinner at RWS. Our senior management 

raised more than S$44,000 from their personal contributions to donate to the 

home as well as distribute red packets and goodie bags comprising household 

necessities to over 130 elderly residents. Subsequently, we organised a special 

outing to RWS in July 2017 where 150 elderly and their families from AWWA 

Senior Community Home and the South West District were treated to lunch 

at Malaysian Food Street followed by a matinee performance of our resident 

theatre production, CHEF: Bibimbap vs Chilli Crab.

S.E.A.A. also provided S$54,000 

cash funding to Zero Waste SG, 

a non-profit organisation, to 

support a new nationwide ‘Bring 

Your Own’ programme for schools 

reaching out to 4,000 primary 

students. The programme provides 

information, incentives and 

resources to encourage students 

to bring their own reusables 

and reduce plastic usage.

OUR SUPPORT FOR  

NATIONAL SERVICE

In Singapore, National Service (NS) is the cornerstone of the country’s peace and 

security. The country’s National Servicemen (NSmen) fulfil their responsibilities 

dutifully to provide a safe and secure environment for Singapore and 

Singaporeans to grow and thrive.

Genting Singapore recognises the 

importance of National Service in 

Singapore and as a good corporate 

citizen, we acknowledge that it 

is a shared responsibility in the 

local community. Our support 

and recognition of our NSmen’s 

contributions has strengthened their 

commitment to serve their country.

Being represented on the Advisory 

Council on Community Relations in 

Defence (ACCORD) has allowed us 

to work closely with stakeholders, 

businesses and the community, 

to provide ideas and feedback on 

defence matters, increasing public 

understanding and raising support 

for national defence.

We also understand the importance 

of families and employers providing 

full support for operationally-ready 

NSmen required to fulfil their NS 

obligations. Our human resources 

policies allow our NSmen employees 

to actively contribute to their In 

Camp Training (ICT) sessions and 

encourage them to maintain fitness 

by organising fitness activities and 

talks on healthy lifestyle. 

In celebrating the contributions and 

commitments of NSmen over the 

last five decades, we organised the 

following activities in 2017:

2017 was the fifth year that we encouraged our NSmen team members 

to wear their NS uniforms to work on 30 June 2017 (Friday), a day before 

Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Day which was on a Saturday.

Resorts World Sentosa’s frontliners donned the NS50 badges  

during the month of July until National Day in August



As part of our NS50 celebrations, 

RWS also partnered with the 

business community in providing 

discounts and benefits for our 

NSmen team members to enjoy  

with their loved ones. 

A number of our tenants were 

also running promotions to 

salute NSmen for their resolute 

commitment and contributions 

towards NS. We promoted these 

attractive deals via various media 

and social media channels.

Recognising NSmen as  

we celebrate NS50
