Sustainability Report  



1 MESSAGE FROM THE CEO AND CHAIRMAN / BOARD STATEMENT 

In the past, we have gone through various challenges, such as SARS in 2003 and the world economic 

and financial crisis in 2009. The current coronavirus pandemic is unprecedented. It is a crisis like no 

others. It has affected many businesses and people. Needless to say, the onrush of the Covid-19 crisis 

has brought many global economic activities to a near standstill and it has been extremely stressful 

for many businesses. Metal Component Engineering Limited and its subsidiaries are no exception. 

Whilst this is not the first global pandemic in the course of human history, it is a modern plague that 

many of us are worrying of a consequent recession that has no parallel in the recent past.  

Meanwhile, this situation seems to have created a new paradigm of business adapting to the stay-at-

home and work-from-home mode of work. While the demand for our product is not a typical panic 

buy during these uncertain times, we need to keep our business strong and viable to meet the 

challenges of the ‘new normal’. My management teams are very involved in the business. They are 

hardworking. They have good business plans. I believe they can manage our business and lead us 

through this crisis. 

Hence, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, we are even more adamant in our belief that building a 

sustainable business is vital to our continued success. We must be fully accountable for our impact on 

the environment, our customers, our people and our community as well as its financial performance.  

Metal Component Engineering Limited (the “Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, the 

“Group”) is pleased to present our sustainability report for the financial year ended 31 December (“FY”) 

2020. Highlighted in this report is the progress and achievements of our organisation in FY2020, with 

a focus on our commitment to work alongside with our valued stakeholders in order to build a 

sustainable business based on our resilience, adaptability and innovation.  

The delivery of sustainable results is, however, a critical aspect of our ability to remain a strong and 

financially stable company. Acknowledging this helps to put into focus our commitment to principles 

laid out in our Corporate Sustainability Policy. Our responsibility to society is to ensure that sustainable 

practices are incorporated into every link of our value chain. We must meet the needs not only of our 

customers, employees and the community we operate in, but also those of our environment and 

posterity.  

This report provides details about how we have met our responsibilities with our key stakeholders 

during FY2020 and beyond, and is to be read in conjunction with the annual report of the Company 

for FY2020.

4 INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY INTO OUR BUSINESS 

The Company believes that corporate social responsibility is a key driver towards long-term 

sustainability. Such responsibility is pragmatically integrated into our business practices as one of the 

core values in our corporate culture. Embedding such responsibility into our management processes

in line with a long-term vision towards a conducive and sustainability future. 

4.1 Sustainability Management Framework 

In July 2017, the Company establish the sustainability reporting framework, performing an analysis on 

the business and operation model as the basis for stakeholder mapping and materiality assessment. 

Through this analysis, the Company identified five key stakeholder groups within our sustainability 

context and their respective material issues to be shown later in this report. 

4.2 Key Stakeholders and Material Issues 

The Company regularly reviews, assess and collects feedback on ESG issues through regular risk 

assessments; which entails the identification, assessment and documentation of material risks (for 

example, fraud, corruption, environmental, health &amp; safety and ESG relevant human capital risks) and 

corresponding internal controls. The Company continuously improves the adequacy and effectiveness 

of its risk assessment process in response to the changing business and operation environment. 

The Company identifies and reviews material issues most relevant and significant to its stakeholders. 

For external stakeholders, priority is afforded to issues important to the society and applicable to us. 

Thereafter, the Company prioritizes sustainability efforts and report issues that are most material to 

the business and the stakeholders. In consideration of specific stakeholders and material issues which 

are country specific, this report focuses on stakeholder engagement and material issues for Singapore 

operations.

4.3 Alignment with International Initiatives 

4.3.1 

Sustainable Development Goals  

Established in 1945 under the Charter of the United Nations (the “Charter”), the general assembly 

occupies a central position as the chief deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the 

United Nations. Comprising all 193 Members of the United Nations, it provides a unique forum for 

multilateral discussion of the full spectrum of international issues covered by the Charter. It also plays 

a significant role in the process of standard-setting and the codification of international law. 

On 25 September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the 17 Sustainable 

Development Goals (“SDG”) to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all as part 

of a new sustainable development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to be achieved over the next 

15 years. Although the SDGs are primarily aimed at governments, they represent an important 

opportunity for businesses to also act for a more sustainable world. We will use SDGs as one of the 

guiding principles for our sustainability initiatives. 

We acknowledge that our participation in reaching the SDGs has room for improvement. As we 

advance on our sustainability journey, we will continue to assess our alignment with the SDGs and, 

whenever possible, redirect our internal priorities and sustainability strategy to more effectively and 

comprehensively address the goals.

SDG Goal 

Relevant Targets to Our Businesses 

(Source: 

http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org) 

Our Participation 

 

13.3: Improve education, awareness-raising, 

and human and institutional capacity on 

climate change mitigation, adaptation, 

impact reduction and early warning. 

We have our own internal processes and 

environmental policies to reduce electricity 

and fuel consumption. Our approach to 

mitigating climate change includes staff 

training and implementing energy-efficient 

measures. We monitor and report our 

Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions and set 

reduction targets. 

 

15.1: By 2020, ensure the conservation, 

restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial 

and inland freshwater ecosystems and their 

services, in particular forests, wetlands, 

mountains and drylands, in line with 

obligations under international agreements. 

All the paper used in our offices is Forest 

Stewardship Council (“FSC”) certified. We 

actively promote the use of FSC paper across 

our organization. 

 

 

 

 

 

The following SDG goals are relevant to our 

business, operations and value chain. They are 

addressed in our various policies at the Group

level. Such goals are also embedded in various 

initiatives carried out across the organization. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We do not believe these goals are relevant to our 

business or industry. They are not within our 

boundaries and scope of influence, and therefore, 

we are currently unable to make noticeable 

contributions to such goals. 

 

 

 

 

 

4.3.2 

United Nation Global Compact   

The United Nations Global Compact (“UNGC”) is a United Nations initiative to encourage businesses 

worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies, and to report on their 

implementation. The UNGC is a principle-based framework for businesses, stating ten principles in the

5 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

Good CSR practices goes hand-in-hand with corporate management. It is vital that the Company’s 

management approaches are adaptable to the business dynamics and operational environment in 

ways which the Company is able to continuously assess the impact, develop sustainability objectives 

and respond in an appropriate manner to meet stakeholders’ expectations. The Company’s CSR 

framework is based on our approach to sustainability which includes policies and measurement 

mechanisms to monitor the impact made by the Company’s businesses and operations. 

The key to the Company’s success of the sustainability programme is via regular and up-to-date 

communications on CSR policies and activities to our stakeholders. Stakeholders are encouraged to 

provide feedback (through the appropriate channels) on the Company’s performance. This 

sustainability report forms a critical component to the continuous cycle of communication and 

evaluation. The overall sustainability context of stakeholder engagement is managed through the CSR 

plan for the Company’s sustainability governance oversight.

5.1.2 

Reduction in carbon footprint 

The Company recognizes that effective management and monitoring of the carbon footprint may 

potentially reduce operating costs, raise brand profile and increase stakeholder value. Our carbon 

footprint is measured in terms of GHG emission which is an absolute measure of the amount of carbon 

dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emitted2.  

The Company targets to achieve an absolute improvement in GHG CO2e Emission (tonnes) efficiency 

by 10% from the base, set in 2017, by 20303. The GHG CO2e Emission (tonnes) decreased from 5705 

in 2017 to 3635 in 2020, a 36% decrease. Although emissions vary amongst differing business lines, 

environmental objectives of each business line have been aligned with the targeted emission 

improvements.  

5.1.3 

Reduction in paper consumption 

All employees are encouraged to minimize paper wastage and adhere to the Internal Paper Usage 

Reduction Guidelines4. The Company targets to reduce paper consumption by 10% from the base, set 

in 2017, by 20305. Although paper consumption varies amongst differing business lines, objectives of 

each business line have been aligned with the targeted consumption improvements.  

The Company had a further 38.2% decrease in paper consumption in weight from FY2017 to FY20206. 

Paper consumption index stands at 101.1 (kg/million SGD), which is a decrease of 2.8% as compared 

to FY2019 at 104.0 (kg/million SGD). We normalize the amount of weights of paper consumed by the 

amount of our revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. The paper consumption 

index is measured in kilograms per SGD million. The Company continues to promote the use of less 

paper and rely on digitisation. 

 

Note: Data for FY2017 to FY2019 were restated to be in line with current year’s  approach and computation 

method. 

 

2 The Company measures its GHG emissions via Scope 1 and 2 (insignificant direct and predominantly indirect respectively) but does not 

include Scope 3 (GHG emissions generated by suppliers). 

3 Average GHG emission improvement per year is approximately 14.0%, in absolute quantity for the past two years. 

4 For example, double-sided printing is set as a default, lower grammage paper is used for daily printing and drafts are printed on blank 

sides of unwanted single-sided papers. Waste paper from the Company is collected for recycling. Employees are encouraged to utilize digital 

documents to further reduce paper consumption. 

5 Average paper reduction per year is approximately 5% in absolute quantity for the past two years. 

6 3,260 kg of paper in FY2020 and 5,275 kg in FY2017. The Company uses Forest Stewardship Council (“FSC”) certified papers or those made 

from KHAN-NA.

5.1.4 

Promoting green practices  

The Company has adopted the ISO 14001 certification that specifies requirements for an effective 

environmental management system. This standard provides assurance to our management, 

employees and external stakeholders that these standards are adopted to minimize operations which 

may have a negative impact to the environment.  

5.2 Caring for Our Employees 

5.2.1 

Our approach 

People are the most valuable resource and an investment to the professional development is vital to 

the Company’s business sustainability. The Company’s goal is to establish positive work ethics 

amongst our employees, in line with the Company’s core values and code of conduct. Such values are 

the foundation upon which the Company builds all its business initiatives and conducts its day-to-day 

activities.   

A motivated workforce conveys a positive and powerful message to the Company’s key stakeholders. 

By attracting, nurturing, empowering and rewarding our employees, we create a conducive 

environment for innovation and inspiration to flourish and boost our competitiveness. These 

commitments to our employees promote a corporate culture of passion, quality, excellence and trust 

within the organization, reflecting in the Company’s ability to create value for our stakeholders.  

Human Resource (“HR”) management principles and policies are developed and established on fair 

employment practices with the goal of attracting, developing and retaining a robust motivated 

workforce. The Company’s HR policies cover key areas such as remuneration, benefits, staff selection, 

career development and training. These policies are communicated to all employees through our 

comprehensive Employee Handbook regularly reviewed by our management. The digital HR Policy is 

published in the SharePoint where all employees have easy access. The Company constantly seeks 

feedback from our staff to ensure that our decisions are aligned as much as possible with their needs. 

The Company’s business operates in an environment comprises of diverse races, cultures and 

geographic locations. HR polices implemented across the organization takes into consideration of the 

prevailing laws and regulations, local culture, norms and racial sensitivity. 

This is the Management’s philosophy regardless of the situation. Hence when the COVID-19 pandemic 

affected us badly during the year, the Management’s priority is to take care of the wellbeing of our 

employees and to ensure their safety and health within our means. People are the most valuable 

resource and an investment to the professional development is vital to the Company’s business 

sustainability.  

In our Singapore office, all employees were issued with a box of surgical mask. Body temperature was 

taken twice a day and duly recorded. Safety Management Measures (SMM) implemented by the 

Singapore Government were strictly adhered to. Common areas were frequently cleaned and 

sanitised. Demarcations of 1m were drawn. Hand sanitizer, wipes, masks were provided at the 

reception area and other common areas like conference room and photocopier area. QR code for 

employees and visitors to scan in was made available at the entrance as well as at the reception. All 

visitors were required to have their body temperature taken and fill up the Visitor Form. During the 

Circuit Breaker, all employees were required to work from home (WFH). They were also required to 

keep the Management informed of their health status daily. HR constantly reminded all staff to 

observe the SMM via email broadcast. 

Similarly, all the 3 sites developed their Standard Operations Procedure (SOP) using the SMM as a 

guide. The security staff will ensure that all employees and visitors put on their masks before entering

the factories. Body temperature was taken twice a day and only those with normal body temperature 

were allowed in. Operations staff worked on shift and they were separated into teams and their meal 

breaks were on staggered hours.  

5.2.2 

Employment practices 

The Company’s employment practices provide equal opportunities based on merits, comprehensive 

training and development. We regularly review employee’s competency gaps and developments 

match their strength to the job requirements. Our performance-based reward scheme provides 

guidance and motivation to employees to perform to their potential, in line with the Company’s 

objectives.  

5.2.2.1 

The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices  

The Company proactively pursue and adopt best practices in HR management. HR practices are guided 

by the Singapore Tripartite Alliance7 for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices. The Tripartite 

Alliance formulated guidelines (covering recruitment, training, treatment and employees’ rewards) on 

fair employment practice to be adopted by employers in Singapore.  

5.2.2.2 

Communications  

Effective communication across the organization is crucial to ensure the alignment of employee’s and 

organizational objectives. This is achieved through communication sessions with specific group of 

employees. Agendas covered at these sessions are customized to the employee’s targeted functional 

scope8.  

5.2.2.3 

Employee feedback  

We value our employees’ expertise in their areas of responsibility and their feedback is important to 

the improvement of the overall management and operation of the organization. Through various 

established processes of employee engagement (such as employee objective setting, performance 

review and exit interview), the Company gathers valuable feedback. In 2020, we started the “Coffee 

With Boss” at our site in Johor, Malaysia, whereby we gathered 8 different workers from ground level 

to have ‘coffee’ with the boss. Only our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Mr Chua Kheng Choon and HR 

staff are present with the workers listening to the feedback directly from the workers. No other 

management staff is present, so there is no filtering and censorship. CEO will have a good feel of the 

ground and manage the feedback for continuous improvement of the organization. We will start 

similar event within our operations in Thailand and Suzhou, China soon. 

Other feedback channels are available for areas relating to the specific business functions and the 

Company has also established a whistle-blowing policy on control and compliance issues. Feedback 

escalation procedures to the senior management are also in place. The Audit Committee of the 

Company reviews arrangements by which staff of the Group may, in confidence, raise concerns about 

possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters and ensures that 

arrangements are in place for the independent investigation of such matters and for appropriate 

follow-up action. The Company has put in place a formal whistle-blowing policy for staff to report and 

raise any concerns which they may have in relation to the foregoing matter. There were no reports of 

such matters for FY2020.  

 

7 Comprising of the Ministry of Manpower, Singapore National Employers Federation and National Trade Union Congress.

while at the quarterly sessions, high level topics include strategic business directions, new service launches, ongoing 

developments and key project reviews.

5.2.2.4 

Career development and training 

The Company recognises that consistent and ongoing education is critical to maintain a competitive, 

skilled, productive and motivated workforce. Employee career development and performance 

management are based on merits and contributing skill sets towards the organization’s objectives 

through objective settings and regular performance reviews. The Company continues to review and 

improve the people development and learning process in light of the changing business and operation 

environment. 

The Company’s training programme covers a variety of business areas and cater to employees with 

different job scopes and skills set requirements. Core training curriculum and contents are developed 

and guided by well-established industry and international standards such as ISO 9100, ISO 14000 and 

IATF 16949. Specific training curriculums are developed on the specific requirements of the businesses. 

Training topics ranges from soft skills development (such as communication and leadership) to 

technical programmes (such as project management and office productivity tools).  

In FY2020, due to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, businesses, offices, schools, training 

centres were shut down for a long period of time. As a result, only minimal and essential trainings 

were carried during FY2020. On average, Senior Management received 9 hours of training as 

compared to 6 hours in FY2019 while Managerial received 2 hours of training as compared to 9 hours 

in FY2019. In light of the challenging situation during the COVID-19 pandemic, we will defer learning 

opportunities and find other approaches to improve the skills and competencies of our staff. We 

continue to revise our training curriculum and programme to align with organizational objectives and 

to strive for effectiveness and efficiency in our training approach.

The above data refers to the Number of Employees in each of New Hires, Resignee and Net Employee 

Movement. 

External contracted companies such as cleaners and security guards working in the Company’s 

premises are not included in the head count. 

The Company expects all contracted companies to share its core HR management practices. During 

the vendor selection process, the Company considers the vendor’s HR management practices as one 

of the key selections and performance criteria. Regular review of the vendor’s performance is 

conducted as one of the determining factors to continue the engagement of the service.  

5.2.4 

Employee benefits 

All non-managerial employees in Singapore are covered by the Employment Act, which provides the 

basic employment terms and working conditions (such as contract requirements, remuneration, hours 

of work, overtime, rest days and annual leave entitlement).  

In addition to the statutory benefits outlined in the Employment Act, we provide beyond-compliance-

level benefits to our fulltime employees. Examples of these benefits include birthday, service, 

marriage and compassionate leaves. 

5.2.4.1 

Work–life balance  

The Company recognizes that the well-being and contentment of its employees are pivotal to the 

success, business sustainability and performance. In support of employees to strike a work-life balance, 

the Company aims to create an environment that allows the harmony in their personal and 

professional life. The Company intends to adopt a flexible approach to work arrangements and offer 

programmes to support health and wellness. 

We understand that the workplace could be stressful due to the competitiveness of our workforce 

and our business. To support our employees in their pursuit of excellence, we will launch various 

programmes and initiatives to balance their work with fun and develop an environment and culture 

of mutual support. 

5.2.4.2 

Retirement and healthcare  

We have presence in various geographic locations where there are various local laws and regulations 

on pension and healthcare for employees. Our HR management practices comply with such laws and 

regulations. In Singapore, the Company participates in the Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) personal 

savings scheme, which helps employees to fund their retirement, home ownership, healthcare and 

education. Under this scheme, monthly deductions from the employees’ gross salaries are paid into 

their CPF savings accounts. The Company makes employer contributions to these accounts, according 

to the rates stipulated by the CPF Act. In addition to CPF contributions, the Company provide 

comprehensive medical coverage for all employees. In other countries such as China, Malaysia and 

Thailand where we have operations in, we abide by the respective countries’ labour compensation 

regulations in this regard. 

Please refer to www.cpf.gov.sg for more information on the CPF scheme and contribution rates.

5.2.5 

Health and safety in the workplace 

The Company is committed to workplace health and safety and take precaution to prevent 

occupational injuries among employees. We believe that optimum work conditions boost morale and 

increase employee’s safety.  

When COVID-19 first breakout, the Management sprang into action by equipping all employees with 

the necessary personal protective equipment (PPE). Based on the guidelines announced by the 

Singapore Government, the Company implemented Safe Management Measures (SMM) and 

appointed Safe Management Officer (SMO) appointed. Employees were put on staggered working 

hours and meal breaks. Employees were also asked to work from home (WFH) during the different 

phases of the Circuit Breaker implemented by the Singapore Government. At our headquarter in 

Singapore, each employee was given a box of surgical mask and a bottle of hand sanitizer. One (1) 

meter demarcation was marked out in common areas like conference room, pantry, and copier 

machine. Conference room and other common areas are sanitised after every use. Employees are 

required to measure their body temperature twice a day, once in the morning and once in the 

afternoon. We also ensured all Singapore employees have uploaded and use the Trace Together App. 

Besides attending to the physical wellbeing of the employees, we also educated and reminded the 

employees of the SMM through email broadcasts. Our Group Hospitalisation &amp; Surgical Insurance also 

extends to cover employees should they be hospitalised for COVID-19.  

As for the sites, the security only allows employees and visitors who are within the normal body 

temperature to enter the premises. Respective SOP was also developed for the different sites 

according to local requirements. In Thailand, workers attached to Cal Comp were required to wear a 

face shield besides wearing a surgical mask. All safety requirements are strictly followed. 

5.2.6 

Individual rights  

Respecting and protecting basic human rights is fundamental to all our operations and deeply 

ingrained in the Company’s Code of Conduct. Labour rights, prohibition of discrimination &amp; 

harassment, protection of privacy, prohibition of forced and child labour, workplace health &amp; safety 

are strictly observed within the work environment. Discrimination and harassment of any kind is not 

tolerated by the Company.  

We also respect our employees’ rights to freedom of association as well as their membership of trade 

unions and other professional bodies.  

In FY2020, none of our workforce was covered by a collective bargaining agreement; no incidents of 

forced labour, child labour or young workers were identified across the organisation, and no human 

rights-related grievances have been reported. 

5.2.7 

Data Safety and Privacy  

Ensuring safety and privacy of our customers’ data is of great priority to us. We have processes and 

controls in place for handling and communicating sensitive and confidential information of our 

customers such as contracts, customer orders and product delivery orders. Our information security 

policies ensure our customers’ data are managed in accordance to the level of confidentiality. We 

strictly observe all local laws and internal regulations applicable to personal information protection.

5.3 Partnering Our Suppliers 

5.3.1 

Our Approach 

As part of our ambition to realize sustainability throughout the Company’s value chain, we extend the 

application of responsible business practices to the local partners and suppliers. We recognize that we 

are only at the early stages of our journey to integrate sustainable business practice throughout our 

supply chain and we commit in our pragmatic approach to continuous improvement. We aim to 

identify new opportunities for collaboration with our suppliers, gradually increase transparency and 

continue to build shared capacity to minimise our indirect environmental and social impacts. 

During FY2020, due to the global Covid-19 pandemic, there were some delays in the deliveries from 

suppliers and consequently to our customers. Alternate arrangements were quickly made thus 

avoiding and preventing any major issues. 

5.3.2 

Supplier Selection 

The Company’s key suppliers are selected through a supplier selection process, taking into account 

the financial health, quality of products &amp; services and pricing competitiveness and overall 

sustainability policies adopted. The final decision is based on the overall assessment, taking a balanced 

view over the selection criteria. 

5.3.3 

Supplier Review  

The Company regularly reviews the performance of key suppliers to determine whether to extend our 

partnership with them. During the key supplier review process, the Company engages with key 

suppliers to communicate our expectations and provide mutual feedback. Such review process 

ensures alignment of our key suppliers’ services and products to our business and sustainability 

objectives through pragmatic and continuous improvement in our partnership with our key suppliers.

5.4 Supporting for Our Community 

5.4.1 

Our Approach 

We provide support to the communities. The key motivation driving all our community engagement 

initiatives is to enable and empower young people. By supporting young people today and helping to 

educate them about the world they are to inherit, our goal is to benefit not only the current generation, 

but also the next. We welcome school educational visit to our plant and support student internship 

and attachment where appropriate.  

We also recognize that meeting the needs of today’s youth goes beyond their own education, security 

and well-being, extending to that of their families, homes and neighbourhoods as well. To this end, 

our engagement programmes also encompass financial and practical support in carefully selected 

communities, through fundraising and voluntary activities.  

Our community initiatives are selected according to how closely they are aligned with our own 

community engagement goals of “enabling and empowering young people”, the anticipated staff 

participation rate, and the tangible impact on the beneficiary. Separately, we will also engage on other 

community initiatives on an ad hoc basis. All our business units and some of our channel partners are 

involved in our community engagement programmes.  

The culture and spirit of giving back to our society are ingrained into our business visions, and reflected 

our commitments under our various brands. 

5.4.2 

Our Community Initiatives Highlight 

5.4.2.1 

Community Initiative 

On 14 January 2020, our Singapore office donated S$1000 through Warren Golf Club in the Charity 

Golf. This donation was for The Hiding Place which is a Christian Home for the rehabilitation of people 

who are in need of help. Through the programmes and services, The Hiding Place promises an 

environment that restores the life balance of the people who need help.  

 

On 19 May 2020, our subsidiary in Malaysia donated S$656 worth of surgical face mask to Hottemp 

Sdn Bhd. This donation was done jointly with HP customer during the Covid-19 pandemic and was 

donated to Johor State Government through Hottemp Sdn Bhd. This company was recommended by 

HP. 

 

On 20 July 2020, our Singapore Office donated S$2000 to TCR Music Station. It is an Event 

Management &amp; Production company promoting Singapore local musical talents and songs. 

 

On 31 July 2020, our China subsidiary donated S$2000 to Suzhou Industrial Park Charity Organisation 

to show our care and concern for the financially poor elderly folks in the city. This organisation will

6 PERFORMANCE TABLE 

6.1 Energy Usage and CO2 Emissions  

Direct and indirect CO2 emissions in GHG emissions are measured in tonnes (t-CO2) and kilowatt hours 

(kWh), from electricity and fuel consumed. The electricity and fuel we purchase are both from non-

renewable sources. 

Our business and function grow over time, and the GHG emissions and electricity consumption vary. 

To ensure consistency and comparability of the GHG emission and electricity consumption measures 

over time, we create a GHG emission index and electricity consumption index for our performance 

monitoring. The index adjusts the GHG emissions and electricity consumption for the size of our 

activities. We normalize the amount of GHG emissions and electricity consumption by the amount of 

our revenues which we use as a proxy to the size of our activities. The GHG emission index is measured 

in t-CO2 per SGD million and the electricity consumption index is measured in kWh per SGD million.

Performance 

For performance tracking purpose, we had set FY2017 data as our base for our 

performance tracking towards our 2030 goals. The data for FY2017 to FY2019 were 

restated so as to be in line with current year’s approach and computation method.  

 

For FY2020, the GHG Emission Index registered an increase of 22.8%. However, the GHG 

CO2e Emission (tonnes) decreased from 5705 in 2017 to 3635 in 2020, a 36% decrease. 

The Electricity Consumption Index also registered an increase in quantity of 22% from 

2019. Both the increase was due to a drop in sales as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.  

We will continue to look for opportunity and cost-benefit solution, for example, exploring 

the use of alternative and complimentary power sources.

6.2 Paper Consumption 

We captured the data for paper consumption by how many reams of paper used where one ream is 

equivalent to 500 sheets of paper. To ensure consistency and comparability across various paper sizes, 

such as A3 and A4 papers, we measured the paper consumption by the weight of paper used which is 

adjusted for the various sizes and quality of papers. 

Our business and function grow over time and the paper consumption patterns vary. We devise a 

paper consumption index for our performance monitoring. The index adjusts the paper consumption 

for the size of our activities. We normalize the amount of weights of paper consumed by the amount 

of our revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. The paper consumption index is 

measured in kilograms per SGD million.

FY2020 

Performance 

For performance tracking purpose, we will use FY2017 data as our base for our 

performance tracking towards our 2030 goals, with an annual decrease of 0.8%. The data 

for FY2017 to FY2019 were restated so as to be in line with current year’s  approach and 

computation method. 

 

In FY2020, the Paper Consumption Index decreased by 2.8% with a reduction in usage 

quantity in kg by 31.07%. This was because of the drop in sales resulting from the Covid-

19 pandemic causing a lockdown and employees have to work from home. More effort 

needed to reduce usage through closer monitoring and improving in processes, for 

example, we target to digitalise our documents and forms as many as practical. We have 

also switched from 80g paper to 70g paper, with some cost reduction.

6.3 Employment Profile 

 

FY2020 

Performance 

In FY2020, Men-to-Women ratios in managerial positions and non-managerial positions 

stand at 3:2 and 2.1:1 respectively. This indicates a decrease in the number of males in the 

Managerial category compared to 2019 due to a deliberate reduction in headcount. The 

non-managerial ratio, 2.1:1, increased slightly for male employee as our technical 

manufacturing industry traditionally had more male participation.

Performance 

For performance tracking purpose, we will use FY2017 data as our base for our 

performance tracking towards our 2030 goals. 

 

For FY2020, the average training hours per employee registered at 0.3, with only a handful 

of the staff sent for training during the Covid-19 pandemic. The low number of training 

hours was due to the lockdown because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Managerial staff 

recorded a reduction of 6.6 hours per employee in training hours, while the non-

managerial recorded a drop of 5.2 hours per employee. Overall, the drop is an average of 

3.4 training hours per employee. We will continue to provide for staff learning 

opportunities in upskilling, generic skills and personal development as soon as the situation 

permits.

Performance 

For performance tracking purpose, we will use FY2017 data as our base for our 

performance tracking towards our 2030 goals. 

 

For FY2020, the Customer Satisfaction Index indicated a 33.3% satisfaction rate. One of our 

Company’s values is “Commitment”, hence, we never stop driving customer centricity and 

employee commitment in order to deliver quality products and services. There were 2 

customer complaints during FY2020. One was in Thailand and the other in Suzhou. There 

was a welding problem in Suzhou. As for Thailand, due to the Covid-19 lockdown and the 

restriction in travelling, the company could not attend to the customer needs when 

required. Notwithstanding, the number of complaints had decreased compared to FY2019. 

We take customer complaints seriously and as a learning opportunity to correct the 

variances to ensure quality and meeting the specifications.
