I am proud to present 

to you PEC’s fourth 

sustainability report, 

which highlights our 

efforts in adopting 

sustainable business 

practices across  

our operations. 

2021 was yet another 

challenging year for the 

industry as the pandemic 

continued to pose a threat 

to public health, livelihoods 

and the economy. COVID-19 

safe distancing measures and 

border closures continued to 

impact business operations 

in the countries where we 

operate. All this inevitably 

led to project disruptions and 

delays. At the same time, 

ensuring the health and safety 

of our workers remained a 

priority. In Singapore, with 

the implementation of strict 

government regulations, 

COVID-19 infection rates among 

foreign workers had been 

reduced significantly. However, 

a fresh challenge of manpower 

shortage exacerbated by barring 

of migrant workers from South 

Asia was faced by companies in 

Singapore and we were  

no exception.

To face these unprecedented 

challenges, we look beyond 

the horizon to consider the 

long-term impacts of COVID-19 

on our business. As such, our 

business is currently undergoing 

numerous changes. 

CEO’S 

MESSAGE 

Firstly, investment into productivity 

and digitalisation is high on our 

agenda. We are continually looking 

for opportunities to streamline and 

automate our operations (such as 

central fabrication and digitisation 

in the area of maintenance 

work). Because of the complex 

nature of our operations, there 

is no straightforward solution 

to automation. We believe that 

innovation is the way forward to 

set ourselves apart in the industry. 

We will continue to invest in IT 

systems and work with our clients 

to adopt these solutions. Our 

past efforts in digitalisation paid 

off during the pandemic, as it 

allowed us to promptly launch 

appropriate tools, software and 

platforms for employees to work 

from home, conduct SafeEntry for 

safe distancing, conduct diagnoses 

remotely and so on. These digital 

tools also allowed us to reduce our 

carbon footprint by reducing the 

need for business travel.

Secondly, we are looking into 

new business opportunities as 

the world transitions to a low 

carbon economy, for example in 

the area of hydrogen production 

and storage. We believe that PEC 

will remain well positioned to 

take on projects involving green 

technologies by leveraging our 

current engineering capabilities  

as well as developing new ones,  

such as process and gas 

compression solutions.

Thirdly, we will be moving our 

head office from 21 Shipyard 

Road to the International Business 

Park in Jurong East – Singapore’s 

pioneer business park which is a 

vibrant site for knowledge-based 

activities. Apart from providing our 

employees with a more convenient 

and accessible location due to its 

proximity to transportation hubs, it 

will present PEC as an international 

player in our industry. We will also 

explore the adoption of green 

energy solutions – such as solar 

panels – in the new premise.

Finally, we will continue to monitor 

markets where the pandemic 

has stabilised and where local 

economies are reverting to 

business-as-usual, such as the UAE, 

one of the world’s most vaccinated 

nations. In our other key markets, 

we will continue to stay abreast 

of the latest changes in border 

controls and other government 

restrictions, so that we can be well-

prepared when we are allowed to 

resume our operations in full.

The COVID-19 pandemic has 

demonstrated to us the importance 

of investing in the long-term 

sustainability of our business. 

We will focus on areas such 

as digitalisation, training, and 

environmental management, 

while pursuing new business 

opportunities in the green economy. 

We will continue to maintain a 

strong focus on occupational health 

and safety as a highest priority. 

We believe that this is how we can 

continue to thrive as the world 

transitions to a new normal, and 

bring PEC to greater heights.  

I wish to thank all our employees, 

customers and stakeholders for their 

continued support as we progress 

on our journey.

SUSTAINABILITY 

REPORT

OUR APPROACH 

TO SUSTAINABILITY

PEC is committed to enhancing 

our management approach and 

improving our performance of 

material ESG factors to bring 

long-term sustainable value for all 

stakeholders. Our approach is guided 

by six core values and our Corporate 

Social Responsibility Policy.

BOARD 

STATEMENT

PEC is committed to upholding the 

highest standards of ethics, integrity 

and governance of the business. 

As a responsible company, we take 

a value-based approach to our 

business and sustainability is high 

on our agenda. The Board provides 

oversight of the management and 

monitoring of PEC’s material ESG 

factors, such as anti-corruption and 

compliance, occupational health 

and safety and environmental 

management. The Board conducts 

an annual review of the strategy 

and performance of PEC’s material 

ESG factors, and endorses the 

information presented in this report.

SUSTAINABILITY 

GOVERNANCE

The Board of Directors at PEC 

regularly review and oversee the 

management of our material 

ESG factors. The Sustainability 

Management Council, which is 

chaired by our Group CEO, supports 

and reports to the Board. The 

Council is comprised of management 

staff and function leaders, and 

is supported by a sustainability 

reporting project team. PEC’s Business 

Excellence (BE) Committee, comprised 

of senior management from various 

departments, reports to the Group 

CEO, and oversees Business Excellence 

targets that includes both financial 

and sustainability targets. These 

targets are endorsed by the Group 

CEO and are assessed every year. 

Our targets set in FY2021 are listed 

on pages 2-3 of this report. 

The Board approves the material 

ESG factors presented in this report, 

in addition to monitoring these 

material ESG factors and providing 

oversight of their management 

through periodic review of key 

performance indicators (KPIs). 

Our sustainability governance 

framework ensures that our 

approach to sustainability adheres 

to SGX requirements.

OUR MATERIAL  

ESG FACTORS

We conducted our last materiality 

assessment in FY2018 by engaging 

with internal stakeholders that 

include senior management and 

different departments, to identify 

our most pressing Environmental, 

Social and Governance (ESG) risks 

and opportunities. With these 

material ESG factors identified, 

we are then able to monitor and 

manage our performance against 

our targets.

ENGAGING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS

We are members of the following industry associations, with whom we also engage with to inform us on best 

practices and trends that will shape the future of the industry in the coming years:

OUR RESPONSE 

TO COVID-19

OVERCOMING  

THE CHALLENGES CAUSED 

BY COVID-19

In FY2021, the COVID-19 pandemic 

continues to affect businesses 

globally, having an impact on 

both the safety and wellbeing of 

our employees and workers, as 

well as business operations due 

to government measures to slow 

down the spread of the virus. The 

Engineering, Procurement and 

Construction Process (EPC) industry 

in Singapore has been particularly 

impacted by manpower shortages. 

Strict border closures in Singapore 

reduced the foreign labour force 

available to support our operations, 

prompting us to take swift action 

to minimise project delays. Our 

clients have also been impacted 

by COVID-19. As such, PEC has had 

to transition the way it operates, 

as well as expand our business 

operations in more diversified 

markets in Singapore and overseas. 

Most notably, we released new 

policies to help us adapt to the 

‘new normal’ and ensure that 

business disruptions are minimised. 

These new policies also formalised 

measures to protect the safety, 

health and wellbeing of our 

employees and workers. 

Our new policies in FY2021 include:

• Group Business Continuity Plan 

Manual

• Flu Pandemic Management Plan

• Outpatient and Hospitalisation

• SaFe Management Measures 

system

• Employee Engagement Team

GROUP BUSINESS 

CONTINUITY PLAN MANUAL

On 1 June 2021, we launched the 

Group Business Continuity Plan 

(GBCP) Manual that provides an 

overview of response frameworks 

to various business risks within each 

geographical area and operational 

scope that PEC’s operations are 

present in. The COVID-19 pandemic 

has disrupted key sectors of the 

economy that has increased the 

volatility of the business landscape. 

The Manual is thus emblematic of 

our commitment to enhance the 

commercial performance, value and 

reputation of PEC and to safeguard 

the wellbeing of employees, 

contractors, customers, the public, 

and the environment. 

Major business risks identified by the 

company were decided upon using 

PEC’s risk management system that 

includes a Decision-Making Matrix. 

The Matrix is a table that helps us 

visualise and compare different risk 

scenarios and their severity, as well 

as informs us on the notification 

procedures.  The Manual also 

outlines the responsibilities of the 

Group Business Continuity Team 

(GBCT) and the Site/Department/

Subsidiary Business Continuity 

Team (SBCT). The GBCT has three 

roles: to provide strategic input 

and direction to the overall 

response effort and ensure the 

protection of the company’s 

reputation and performance; 

handle high level communications 

with key stakeholders including 

public, media, shareholders and 

government agencies; ensure all 

necessary support is available for 

SBCT including resources, funds, 

technical input and specialist advice.

FLU PANDEMIC 

MANAGEMENT PLAN

At the same time, we launched our 

Flu Pandemic Management Plan. Its 

purpose is to provide a framework 

for an effective response that 

protects PEC’s stakeholders, 

reputation and business activities 

in the event of a disruption from a 

virus outbreak. 

The plan supplements other 

company applicable procedures 

and publications by the Ministry 

of Health (MOH), Ministry of 

Manpower (MOM), National 

Environment Agency (NEA) and 

other relevant authorities. It can 

provide guidance in the event of a 

flu pandemic. 

OUTPATIENT AND 

HOSPITALISATION

The Outpatient and Hospitalisation 

policy strengthens our wellbeing 

and safety measures, which 

are thoroughly discussed in 

the Occupational Health and 

Safety section of this report. The 

Outpatient and Hospitalisation 

procedure, which is applicable to all 

employees and was created on  

1 July 2020 provides clear guidelines 

to employees in need of such 

treatment. The Procedure provides 

a clear hierarchy of roles and 

responsibilities to ensure employees 

will be able to seek treatment 

immediately in accordance to the 

proper protocols. 

SAFE MANAGEMENT 

MEASURES SYSTEM 

The SaFE Management Measures 

System (SMMS)’s key purpose is 

to ensure that PEC provides a 

safe working environment for 

all employees at the corporate, 

operating sites and local 

subsidiaries of the PEC Group.  

The SMMS provides a clear 

description of the roles and 

responsibilities and includes the 

creation of groups such as the SaFe 

Management Working Committee 

(SWC) whose core role is to ensure 

proper execution of the SMMS. 

Important management measures 

include reducing physical interaction 

for safe distancing purposes, 

supporting contact tracing and 

encouraging workers to observe 

good personal hygiene. Reports of 

the progress and potential breaches 

of these measures will be recorded 

and reviewed by the SWC on a 

monthly basis. 

COVID-SAFE WORKSITE, 

ACCOMMODATION, 

TRANSPORTATION AND 

WORKPLACE

To protect the safety, health and 

wellbeing of our workforce, we 

continue to implement appropriate 

measures with respect to their  

accommodation, transportation 

and workplace. Our three-pronged 

strategy enacted at the start of 

the pandemic in 2019 includes the 

following measures:

SUSTAINABILITY 

REPORT

PECare Initiative: Protecting the Mental Health of  

Our Workforce During COVID-19

The PECare initiative was developed in 2016 with the input of 

professional psychologists. This is an open-door programme for 

employees to discuss issues affecting their own or their peers’ 

mental wellbeing. PEC’s HR Director manages the programme as 

the Chairman and it is supported by ‘champions/coaches’ whom 

are employee, volunteers trained by professional counsellors. 

In 2021, we expanded the initiative to address concerns over 

mental health and burnout amid the prolonged circuit-breaker 

and quarantine measures. This was especially pertinent for 

employees living in dormitories, where we observed much 

higher demand for champions and coaches to provide moral 

and emotional support. 

3. COVID-SaFe 

Accommodation  

&amp; Transportation:

 

o Allocated the same 

accommodation to workers 

in the same project to reduce 

potential intermixing and 

cross infection

 

o Appointed room leaders 

responsible for assisting their 

peers to comply with safety 

measures and managing 

their physical and mental 

wellbeing 

 

o Arranged point-to-

point transportation 

between worksites and 

accommodation to facilitate 

the commute of workers

MOVING FORWARD

The COVID-19 pandemic continues 

to disrupt the way our business 

operates. We continue to adhere 

to the government-mandated 

regulations on protecting the health 

and wellbeing of our employees 

since safe distancing measures are 

likely to remain in the foreseeable 

future. We are also committed 

to going above and beyond the 

standard COVID-19 safety measures 

by providing our employees working 

on-site with proper surgical masks 

and sanitisers. We will continue to 

review, adapt and strengthen our 

policies, operating standards and 

procedures to manage new risks 

while ensuring we create sustainable 

long-term value. 

GOVERNANCE

Implementing a robust corporate 

governance approach highlights 

our commitment to conducting 

ourselves according to the highest 

standards and supporting our 

sustainability aspirations. Prompted 

by the ongoing impacts of the 

COVID-19 pandemic, we developed 

the Group Business Continuity 

Plan (GBCP) that provides a high-

level overview of the measures 

and procedures that we will take 

based on different risk scenarios. 

This, together with our existing 

Group policies and the Code of 

Business Ethics and Conduct, Anti-

Bribery and Corruption Policy, and 

Whistleblowing Policy, provided us 

with a robust corporate governance 

approach. More information on 

how we govern PEC can be found 

on pages 17 to 36 in the Corporate 

Governance Report section of the 

Annual Report. For more information 

on the BCP, refer to page 9.

ANTI-BRIBERY &amp; 

CORRUPTION POLICY 

We launched an anti-bribery and 

corruption policy on 31 March 2020 

that supports our commitment to 

foster a robust culture of integrity. 

The policy expects all employees 

of PEC to be aware of preventing 

bribery and corruption in all forms. 

This means strict adherence to 

protocols concerning gifts and 

entertainment, charitable and 

political contributions, and other 

activities that would be seen as a 

bribe or a corrupt act. Employees 

in doubt are strongly encouraged 

to seek guidance from their 

supervisors, the Group Human 

Resources Department, Corporate 

Services Department, or the senior 

management team. 

Adhering to the highest ethical 

standards on bribery and 

corruption and conducting 

business with integrity is of utmost 

importance at PEC. Any employee 

found to violate these standards 

will face disciplinary action 

and/or immediate termination 

in compliance with local and 

regulatory authorities. 

CODE OF BUSINESS ETHICS 

AND CONDUCT

All employees must abide to the 

following standards of integrity 

and conduct: 

• Compliance with laws, rules, 

and regulations in cities and 

countries in which the company 

operates

• Avoiding conflicts of interest

• Prohibition of insider trading 

• Applying good judgement 

with regards to gifts and 

entertainment

• Reporting any illegal or 

unethical behaviour 

• Protecting human rights 

WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY

Our whistleblowing procedures 

ensure that any concerns on 

malpractices within PEC are 

addressed appropriately with 

management. All employees are 

systematically made aware and 

reminded of the procedures every

Whistleblowing Policy.

TRAINING

We conduct training sessions for 

our workforce to sustain and 

improve their understanding on 

corporate governance and to help 

them keep abreast of important 

topics that may impact the 

business. In FY2021, key members 

of the Board of Directors attended 

the Public Sector Governance 

in the Face of Complex Global 

Changes training, to help them 

stay up-to-date on the evolving 

risks in our landscape.

In FY2020, there was a reported 

incident of misappropriation 

committed by an employee of 

our subsidiary in China, PEC 

Construction Equipment Leasing 

Co. (Huizhou) Ltd. Since the 

discovery of the misappropriation, 

a police report has been lodged 

and the employee was terminated. 

The accused pleaded guilty and 

was subsequently sentenced by 

the Court. We have also released 

a public announcement to 

the Singapore Stock Exchange 

regarding this incident.

The Occupational Health and Safety, Environmental, Quality and Security (OHSEQS) Committee ensures that we 

achieve high quality standards to exceed our customers’ expectations.

equipment, electricity and accommodation and 

transportation for our site workers. 

All the suppliers we work with are assessed based on 

our Procurement &amp; Warehousing Policy, which includes 

indicators such as Quality of Products and Services, 

Health, Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE), as well 

as price competitiveness. While we normally conduct 

on-site audits on our suppliers to ensure compliance 

and highlight areas of improvement, COVID-19 has 

meant that we are unable to do so. 

PRODUCT QUALITY

In order to achieve cost efficiency, high productivity 

levels, safety and the timely completion of projects, we 

enact the following policies and practices: 

• 

Quality Policy: This policy reflects our commitment 

to improving customer satisfaction. Our Quality 

Management Program includes quality improvement 

training for employees, effective process control 

and conducting periodic system assessments. Due 

to COVID-19, this is conducted via video and audio 

applications such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom. 

• OHSEQS Management System: Covers all projects 

and maintenance works undertaken by PEC. 

 

o Project execution plans include a quality assurance 

plan that outlines the site organisation layout, roles 

and tasks of each officer, the control measures, 

the general execution procedures, and method 

statements to be adopted by the project team. 

 

o Constant performance evaluation of our approved 

suppliers and sub-contractors through feedbacks 

from respective departments and site. Any issues 

uncovered will be addressed according to the 

quality plan as detailed by the OHSEQS. The quality 

team conducts on-site visits throughout the project 

duration to ensure that the work is conducted 

according to our OHSEQS procedures and all 

OHSEQS related issues are adequately addressed. 

 

o OHSEQS Management Review is carried out 

by the OHSEQS Committee which includes Top 

Management, to ensure OHSEQS Management 

Systems remain sustainable, adequate and effective. 

PRODUCTIVITY MANAGEMENT 

Due to the ongoing SMM on site as a consequence 

of the pandemic, productivity will inevitably be 

affected. We are in the process of expanding the use 

of automated welding machines and centralising our 

fabrication to reduce labour costs. 

We also continue to utilise teleconferencing 

technology in place of physical meetings with clients 

and updates on overseas subsidiaries’ operations. This 

means that we have reduced overseas travel resulting 

in less carbon emissions.

Cloud Computing:  

Seamless Remote Working

Due to the extensive investments PEC 

made into technology in the years before 

COVID-19, we were able to help our office-

based employees to seamlessly transition 

into remote working conditions without 

disrupting our business. 

We employed cloud-based Unified 

Communication and Collaboration (UC&amp;C) 

technology, a platform that connects 

different communication systems and 

collaboration tools together such as 

messaging, voice and video calling, file 

sharing and video conferencing. This 

ensures a high level of interaction between 

departments regardless of where each 

employee is physically based in, and 

delivers the following benefits: better 

productivity, reduced costs, improved 

performance and customer satisfaction, and 

facilitates collaboration.

PEOPLE

Our people are an important component to PEC’s sustainable growth and success. To achieve our vision of being 

a preferred business partner for projects works and maintenance services, we invest heavily in a holistic human 

resource strategy. This means providing continuous training and development for our employees across PEC, creating 

a conducive and safe workplace for our employees, and cultivating a caring environment that values people. 

We are proud to have an ethnically diverse workforce across the markets we operate in. At PEC, we foster an 

environment that respects and celebrates the cultural differences of our workforce.

CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY

The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasised the 

importance of being agile and digitally-connected 

amidst a rapidly evolving business landscape. Prior to 

the pandemic, we have made substantial investments 

into our technological capabilities such as equipping 

workers with mobile apps carrying cloud computing 

services. This enables workers to carry out their 

fieldwork while seamlessly recording their progress 

on the apps. PEC is committed to expanding its 

Digital Acceleration Roadmap and achieve our digital 

transformation commitments.

DATA PROTECTION AND CYBERSECURITY

As PEC expands its technological capabilities, we 

are committed to implementing robust safeguards 

in our cybersecurity and data protection measures. 

These measures span across four premises: End Point 

Devices such as computers and servers, Networks, 

Cloud Infrastructure, and Identity. Data access is strictly 

controlled via controls such as System Access Request 

(ACL), Multi-factor Authentication, Right Management 

Service and password control. Our technological assets 

are further protected by firewall, advanced threat 

analytics, malware and antivirus software programmes. 

In the event of a disaster, PEC’s IT infrastructure will be 

recovered through our Disaster Recovery Plan, enabling 

the business to quickly resume operations from any 

unpredictable incidents.

EMPLOYEE TURNOVER

PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT

All staff at PEC undergoes regular appraisals to receive 

feedback from their managers and supervisors. This 

ensures our employees are made aware of their 

strengths and areas of improvement thus contributing 

to their long-term growth at PEC. This year, the Human 

Resource department has introduced a new Annual 

Performance Appraisal (APA) in portal to make it easier 

for managers and supervisors to conduct the appraisals. 

LEARNING &amp; DEVELOPMENT

Our Learning and Development Policy, developed in 

accordance with the ISO29993 standard4, highlights our 

commitment to enable our employees to deliver the 

highest quality of work for our customers in a safe and 

nurturing environment. We provide technical training 

for workers such as equipment fitting, welding and 

machinery alignment.

In FY2021, we spent an average of $615 per employee 

on learning and development.

ISO29993 specifies requirements for providers of learning services outside formal education

AVERAGE TRAINING HOURS PER EMPLOYEE

Last year, our employees received an average of 

27.5 hours of training hours. The decline of training 

activities was due to restrictions faced during the 

pandemic for in-person training. This includes external 

training such as WSH trainings, seminars, and other 

short term courses. In-house in-person training was also 

affected by the restrictions. Although online trainings 

were introduced (synchronized e-learning), trainees – 

in particular workers – faced limitations in terms of IT 

equipment and internet connectivity.

COVID-RELATED TRAINING

In the last financial year, many of our workers were 

held in quarantine due to a nationwide outbreak of 

COVID-19 in foreign worker dormitories. This year, to 

help workers transition back to working on site, we 

organised a half-day B@ck2Work Refresher workshop. 

The workshop provided workers with the skills and 

knowledge required to refresh their understanding 

of their roles and responsibilities, where to receive 

psychological support, and knowledge on complying 

with best practices for a safe, healthy and secure  

work environment.

In accordance with BCA’s advisories, all PEC workers 

and appointed SaFe Distancing Officers (SDOs) 

and SaFe Management Officers (SMOs) working at 

our construction sites have also completed BCA’s 

COVID-Safe Training for Workers and SMO Course 

for Construction. Similarly, all other appointed SDOs 

and SMOs have attended training sessions offered by 

other training providers. This ensures our workers are 

equipped with skills and knowledge to coordinate 

the implementation of the SMM and implementation 

plans, while ensuring a safe working environment for 

all with minimal risks of further outbreaks. 

VOCATIONAL TRAINING

In addition to in-person trainings, our workers 

continued to receive vocational trainings through 

online platforms. Lessons were conducted on Microsoft 

Teams, while learning outcomes were assessed using 

Microsoft Forms. Through these online platforms, we 

conducted various courses such as the Safety Induction 

Program and Supervisory HSSE, Engineering Programs 

for supervisors and managers.

With training conducted online, we were also able 

to expand the reach of our training programs as 

employees across the region could also join in from 

their homes or offices. For example, colleagues in 

Vietnam and Malaysia joined HSSE training sessions 

hosted by the team in Singapore. Such benefits from 

conducting training online has encouraged us to 

rethink how training can be conducted.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT

To cultivate strong relationships between leaders, 

management, and employees, we ensure that two-way 

communication channels are kept open, and accessible 

through our regular site-level Toolbox meetings. 

HUMAN RIGHTS

PEC strongly believes in protecting and advancing 

human rights in our operations. This commitment has 

been recently built into our Code of Business Ethics and 

Conduct which guides all employees of PEC. Under the 

updated code, we reiterated our commitment to treat 

everyone with respect and dignity, encourage diversity, 

provide safe working conditions, and promote equal 

opportunity for all. We prohibit harassment, bullying, 

discrimination, use of child, compulsory or forced 

labour and trafficking in persons for any purpose across 

all our operations. 

In FY2021, there were no substantiated incidents of 

non-compliance relating to discrimination, forced 

labour, child labour or freedom of association in the 

reported period.

REPORT

OUR OHS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Our HSSE Management system, applied to all workers operating within our sites, adheres to the requirements 

stipulated in ISO 45001 on the Occupational Safety &amp; Health Management System. It is also aligned with 

internationally recognised standards such as ISO 9001 and ISO 14001. We are also BizSafe Star certified, having 

completed the highest level of a nationally recognised workplace safety and health management standard 

including risk management activities.

ASSESSING RISKS

For all jobs, PEC applies a five-stage risk assessment process under the supervision of experts and trained HSSE 

personnel. The process includes:

Hazard  

and Risk 

Identification

Preparation

Impact 

Assessment

Risk 

Control

Review

Preparation

For the preparation phase, the Risk Management 

Team will be set-up led by a Site Risk Management 

champion. All activities at the sites will be assigned 

to a Risk Assessment Team led by a Risk Management 

Member. The team will then discuss the tasks to be 

completed to ensure that they are well-versed with 

their assigned tasks.

Hazard and Risk Identification, Impact Assessment  

and Risk Control

We then conduct an Aspect Impact Risk Assessment 

(AIRA) to satisfy the requirements of both ISO 14001 

and ISO 45001, which assess each of our processes in 

terms of environmental and OHS aspects. Processes 

are continuously monitored by supervisors and 

foremen to ensure the controls indicated in the AIRA 

are implemented. Site HSSE Committee meetings are 

conducted monthly, chaired by the Site Manager, to 

discuss on areas for improvement.

During the pandemic, we also incorporated COVID-19 

SMM in our Risk Management and Site Action Plan. 

This is a structured plan formulated for PEC to cope 

with the pandemic in terms of correction, prevention 

and mitigative measures pertaining to COVID-19.

Review

We conduct reviews when there is a change in process 

or work location. These are also conducted at least 

once every 3 years.

OHS training for COVID-19

We implement COVID-19 training as part of requirements in the Safe Restart Criteria set by Building and 

Construction Authority (BCA) and Association of Process Industry (ASPRI). In addition, our site inductions 

also highlight SMM on top of these requirements. Training topics conducted for workers to adapt to 

the pandemic include: Back to work, back to basics and vehicular safety.

REPORTING AND INVESTIGATION  

OF INCIDENTS 

Workers are strongly encouraged to report incidences 

of Near Misses and Behavioural Based Safety 

Observations (BSSO). To promote a culture of being 

aware about, and speaking up on safety concerns, 

workers that are the most diligent in reporting the best 

Near Misses and BBSOs are awarded with vouchers. 

Employees and workers use our PEC SMSGo mobile 

application to report any incidents quickly. 

Once an incident has been reported, it will be 

investigated according to our Incident Investigation and 

Reporting Procedure protocols. Site specific incident 

investigation methodologies are also utilised if clients 

request for a specific method of investigation. Control 

measures are then recommended, communicated and 

implemented under strict supervision on-site. 

HEALTH AND WELLBEING

To care for the health and wellbeing of our workers, 

we implemented the following measures that align 

with recommendations from the Singapore’s Workplace 

Safety and Health (WSH) Council: 

• Medical Chits are issued electronically for workers 

and employees to visit the doctor directly from their 

homes or dormitories. 

• Medical declarations during group meetings such as 

Toolbox Meetings and Pre-Task Talks are provided 

to workers that feel unwell to seek medical 

attention immediately, rather than exposing them 

to further occupational risks. 

• The expansion of PECare initiative by ensuring that 

the coaching team meets every 6 months. During 

each meeting, coaches share their current cases 

and completed cases. There are currently 17 PECare 

champions, 16 coaches and 8 newly trained coaches. 

For more information on the PECare initiative, refer 

to page 10.

COMMUNICATION AND TRAINING 

We ensure the implementation of the following 

practices to clearly communicate on the HSSE standards 

to all employees: 

• Site inductions for all new employees and 

employees who are posted to new work sites. 

• 

Mandatory workplace safety and health training 

for all employees and workers in process industries 

pharmaceutical industries and laboratories, 

construction sites and confined spaces.

• HSSE related updates are communicated through 

the intranet, notice boards and Pre-Task Talks. 

Each employee and worker own an updated copy 

of their Training Passport, which is a document that 

captures all the training the worker has attended. This 

enables supervisors on site to verify if a worker has 

completed the necessary trainings. 

In the next phase of our training initiatives, we plan 

to focus on topics such as self-awareness, effective 

engagement with the workforce, and empowerment 

of employees at supervisory levels. 

In FY2021, each worker completed an average of 23.08 

hours of safety-related training, including supervising 

safety, PPE, and adhering to safe driving standards.

Due to COVID-19, we temporarily paused our Annual 

Health Screenings where all employees are tested for 

illnesses and detection for diseases that are in their 

early stages. We hope to resume the screenings once it 

is safe to do so. 

Workplace Health Promotion (WHP) 

Programme 

To help our employees cultivate a better work life balance 

and promote bonding, we planned to host a variety of 

online webinars and yoga activities however, we made 

the difficult decision to temporarily postpone them to 

a later date due to COVID-19. We hope to resume these 

activities once it is safe to do so.

Employee Engagement Team 

We developed an Employee Engagement Team (EET) 

procedure on 1 July 2020. This refers to the creation 

of a dedicated team from the Human Resources 

department to oversee employees’ health, wellbeing, 

and safety concerns in the event of a disruption 

that impacts our operations. The EET is responsible 

for relaying the necessary steps and communicating 

instructions to all employees at each subsidiary where 

PEC operates in to ensure proper execution.

WORKER PARTICIPATION AND 

CONSULTATION

We ensure that worker representations attend all 

HSSE Group Meetings, which occur on a monthly basis. 

These meetings address issues relating to occupational 

health, safety, security, environment and welfare-

related concerns. This arrangement allows for a 

seamless two-way communication and consultation on 

matters relating to the development, implementation, 

evaluation and overall improvement of the OHS 

Management System.

On 17 September 2020, work was being conducted 

by two workers on a pipeline in a process plant that 

contained toxic gases. The workers were severely 

affected by the gasses and a third worker attempted 

to provide aid. All three workers were sent to a 

hospital to treat their injuries and unfortunately, one 

succumbed to his injuries on 22 September 2020. We 

took immediate action to stop all works involving this 

system and conduct a stand-down to communicate the 

incident to the workforce. To ensure such incidents 

do not recur, we conducted a thorough report to 

investigate the incident and will take further action 

drawing from the results of the report.

INJURIES

In FY2021, we had a Lost Time Incident Rate of 0.09. To 

help us develop a more targeted approach to treating 

injuries, we categorise them into low-consequence and 

high-consequence injuries. Low-consequence injuries 

include traffic incidents, property damage (vehicular), 

opening of process equipment, lacerations, contusions, 

minor bodily injuries, noise induced deafness.

High consequence injuries (LTIs) are due to uncontrolled 

discharge (chemical or gases) and line of fire. 

To prevent further incidents like these from occurring, we 

have in place a number of controls, including elimination, 

substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls 

and personal protection equipment.

Note: Medical leave is defined as employees who were on medical leave and hospitalisation leave. Data for absentee rate was not available in 2018 

and 2019 for Thailand and Myanmar.

The absenteeism rate for Singapore in 2021 was higher than previous years due to a change in the way our payroll 

system calculates this figure. In 2021, we also included figures from a newly incorporated company in Singapore.

SUSTAINABILITY 

REPORT

We have been monitoring our environmental 

performance across energy/emissions, water and waste, 

and will continuously seek performance improvements 

through more environmentally friendly practices. 

ENERGY AND EMISSIONS 

Energy is used largely in our offices and fabrication 

facilities, including electricity for lighting and air-

conditioning. Diesel is consumed by our fleet of vehicles 

used for transportation between facilities and project 

sites as well as to power some of our onsite equipment.

We have a number of ongoing practices which help us to 

manage our energy consumption and carbon emissions: 

• 

Monitoring of carbon emissions: Every month, we 

monitor our carbon emissions using a dashboard 

which captures our diesel and electricity consumption. 

OHSEQS management review meetings, conducted by 

our QA department and attended by all our directors 

and Site-in-Charge, is held to evaluate carbon emission 

performance. We plan to use the trend data gathered 

to set carbon emissions limits in the future.

• GPS-tracking on vehicles: To ensure the most 

efficient usage of diesel, all our vehicles are 

installed with GPS and their movements tracked 

by our logistics department. This allows the 

department to deploy the nearest vehicle whenever 

the department receives a request for transport. It is 

also able to collect data on routes taken by vehicles 

over the years, which enables the department to 

plan the most efficient route for drivers to take.

• Regular maintenance of vehicles and machines: 

to ensure that they run efficiently

Hazardous waste

The types of hazardous waste generated at our facilities 

are solid toxic waste and used hydraulic oil, which is stored 

in drums and disposed by an authorised waste collector. 

We continue to adhere to the Mandatory Waste 

Reporting procedures as outlined by the National 

Environment Agency (NEA), we report the disposal of 

all solid and liquid hazardous waste to NEA’s online 

portal as part of their Waste Resources Management 

System initiatives. 

ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE 

No significant breaches of environmental regulations 

and spills were reported. 

• Sustainable Procurement: When we procure 

new equipment such as welding machines, diesel 

efficiency is a criteria for selling vendors

• Electrical Energy Management Initiative: Includes 

replacement of fluorescent bulbs with LED bulbs 

within our offices and facilities. 

• Switch-off Initiative: Turning off  the lights for an 

hour over lunch across all PEC sites.

• Installing lighting motion sensors within our office 

staircases and communicating to employees on 

setting the air conditioner temperature to 24°C.

WATER CONSERVATION 

Municipal water is utilised at our office buildings, 

dormitories and facilities. We take several measures 

to conserve water such as implementing an awareness 

programme that include putting signs and posters on 

good water saving practices. We also undertake regular 

maintenance of the water system to prevent leakages. 

Prior to COVID-19, we installed water saving fittings 

in toilets and washrooms that use water at lesser 

capacities. However, given the urgency of upholding 

hygiene measures amidst the ongoing pandemic, we 

have temporarily paused the usage of these fittings.

MANAGING WASTE 

Non-hazardous waste

Waste generated in our offices and worksites include 

newspaper, wood crates, wood pallets, carton boxes, 

plastic bottles, food waste, metal cans and metal scraps.

Going Paperless

Electronic Payslip (ePayslip)

In line with our efforts to transit to more 

environmentally-friendly initiatives, we worked with 

our IT department to begin issuing e-Payslips to our 

workers since July 2020. Through this initiative, we 

saved 22.5 kilograms of papers per month, and 270 

kilograms of paper in total, from going to the landfill.

Apart from saving paper, this initiative also 

eliminated the need for workers to collect their 

printed payslips physically at our offices, which 

reduced contact and risk of COVID-19 infection.

Electronic Payment Voucher

We also continue to implement our Electronic 

Payment Voucher initiative as part of our 

overall target to reduce our waste output. This 

programme was launched on 1 July 2019 and 

entails all purchase orders issued to our vendors to 

be in electronic formats, which cuts down on paper 

consumption. Most of our documents are now 

uploaded electronically to portal/sharepoints.
