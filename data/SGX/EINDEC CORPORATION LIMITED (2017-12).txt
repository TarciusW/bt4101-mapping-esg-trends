BOARD STATEMENT 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We are pleased to present the inaugural annual Sustainability Report of Eindec 

for our financial year ended 31 December 2017 (“FY2017”). This report is 

prepared in compliance with the requirements of SGX-ST Listing Rules 711A 

and 711B, and references the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core 

option. Eindec has chosen the GRI framework as it is a well-known and globally-

recognised sustainability reporting standard. This report highlights the key 

economic, environmental, social and governance (EESG) related initiatives 

carried throughout a 12-month period, from 1 January to 31 December 2017 

focusing on our Malaysia plant.  

In defining our reporting content, we applied GRI’s principles defining report 

content by considering the Group’s activities, impacts and substantive 

expectations and interests of its stakeholders. We observed a total of four 

principles, including materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability index 

and completeness. For reporting quality, we observed principles of balance, 

comparability, accuracy, timeliness, clarity and reliability. 

The EESG data and information provided have not been verified by an 

independent third party. Our report is done in good faith and to the best of our 

knowledge. 

The board of directors of the Group (the “Board”) oversees the management and 

monitoring of these factors and takes them into consideration in the determination 

of the Group’s strategic direction and policies.  

We welcome feedback from our stakeholders with regards to our sustainability 

efforts as this enables us to consistently improve our policies, systems and results. 

Please send your comments and suggestions to enquiry@eindec.com.sg.

We take a strategic and comprehensive approach towards sustainability as we acknowledge the 

importance of effective EESG strategy and management across the business operations.

environmental associated risks and opportunities. We strive to continuously enhance our sustainability 

approach and performance through regular policy and operations reviews to positively contribute to our

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

Our sustainability process begins with the identification of relevant aspect. Relevant aspects are then 

prioritised to identify potential material factors which are subject to validation. The end result of this 

process is a list of material factors in the sustainability report.  

We conducted our inaugural materiality assessment during the year under the guidance of an external 

consultant, together with key personnel from the respective departments. In addition, the Group adopts 

a matrix-based approach based on likelihood and impact of occurrences to address the Company’s 

sustainability risk profile and priorities issues. We shall use this method to monitor our risk profile on 

regular basis. Going forward, materiality review will be conducted every year, incorporating inputs 

from stakeholder engagements. 

In order to determine if an aspect is material, we assessed its potential impact on the economy, 

environment and society and its influence on the stakeholders. This year material aspects were identified 

and prioritised through internal workshops together with senior management and guidance from our 

consultant. Peer reviews and social impact assessments were performed at site level.  

Following polling exercise involving key personnel from various departments and validation from our 

Board, the following 7 material EESG factors have been selected:

ECONOMIC 

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

• 

Achieve sustainable growth through strengthening our presence in Asia Pacific and China, focus in 

streamlining operational efficiencies and continue to innovate our products and systems across our three 

product segments 

 

Eindec’s core business activities are in the provision of design, manufacturing and distribution 

capabilities in cleanroom equipment as well as heating, ventilation and air-conditioning equipment for 

the real estate sector.  

Compared to financial year ended 31 December 2016, the Group’s financial performance for the 

FY2017 was affected by the slowdown in the real estate operating environment for both the Singapore 

and PRC.  

For detailed financial results, please refer to the following sections in our Annual Report for FY2017 

issued in April 2018, which can be retrieved from SGXNet: 

• 

Financial Review, pages 8 to 9 

• 

Financial Statements, pages 48 to 101. 

At Eindec, we strive to reduce cost while maintaining quality. We will continue to enhance our efforts 

in improving operational efficiency to achieve cost reduction and explore new vendors who can provide 

higher quality of services at reasonable prices.  

With more than 30 years of establishment in Singapore, Eindec aims to become a leading clean air 

environmental technology solutions provider under its proprietary “Eindec” and “Kyodo” brands.

ANTI-CORRUPTION 

✓ 

Conduct our business with integrity and transparency with no compromise on corruption. 

 

The Group has zero tolerance on fraudulent and corrupt practices that may disrupt the business 

operations and impede the growth of the business due to loss of trust in Eindec that we have built over 

the years. 

To effectively monitor anti-corruption practices, the Group adopts several policies such as the Conduct 

&amp; Discipline Policy, the Conflict of Interest Policy and the Fraud and Whistle Blowing Policy to prevent, 

to govern and facilitate the reporting of any illegal or unethical practices across the businesses. 

For this reporting period, there was no incident of non-compliance with the relevant law and regulations 

resulting in internal disciplinary action or public allegation. There was also no non-compliance relating 

to bribery, extortion, fraud and money laundering. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fraud and Whistle-blowing Policy 

The Group has implemented a Fraud and Whistle Blowing policy whereby a designated mailing address 

and email address are provided for all employees to raise concerns about possible improprieties in 

matters of financial reporting or other matters which they become aware and to ensure that:  

I. 

independent investigations are carried out in an appropriate and timely manner;  

 

II. 

appropriate action is taken to correct the weakness in internal controls and policies which 

allowed the perpetration of fraud and/ or misconduct and to prevent a recurrence; and  

 

III. 

administrative, disciplinary, civil and/or criminal actions that are initiated following the 

completion of investigations are appropriate, balance and fair, while providing reassurance that 

employees will be protected from reprisals or victimisation for whistle-blowing in good faith 

and without malice.
