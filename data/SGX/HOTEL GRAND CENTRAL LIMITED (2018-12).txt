About the Report 

Hotel Grand Central is proud to present our second Sustainability Report which is prepared in accordance with Practice 

Note 7.6 by Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”). This report aims to encapsulate our approach 

and performance on Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) topics identified as the most important to the 

Group and its stakeholders. 

The reporting scope covers the performance of seven (7) wholly-owned hotels in Singapore, Australia and New Zealand 

for the period from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”). Wherever possible, comparative performance 

data for FY2017 has also been included. As our reporting practice matures, we look forward to expanding our reporting 

scope in subsequent years. 

The report has been prepared in accordance with the internationally accepted reporting framework Global Reporting 

Initiative (“GRI”) Standards – Core Option. The framework has been selected as it covers a comprehensive range of 

disclosures suitable for HGC and the industry it operates in.

Case Study: HGC gives back to society!  

 

 In FY2018, a total of close to SGD$200,000 was donated to various charitable organisations across Singapore. They 

range from charity healthcare institutions, voluntary welfare organisations for the physically and visually 

handicapped, elderly, children and animals as well as home hospice care providers. $75,000 was also presented to 

National University of Singapore as a support towards education in Singapore. In FY2019, HGC looks to further its 

contribution through a scholarship donation to the NUS School of Social Sciences for a sum of $150,000.

Materiality Assessment 

With our regular assessment of stakeholder feedback vis-à-vis industry trends, we aim to transform key concerns that 

matter most to our key stakeholders into actionable practices that improve our day to day operations. For the financial 

year ended 2018, the Management has reviewed the list of material matters reported in 2017 for its relevance in light 

of the new reporting scope. The seven (7) sustainability matters; (6) priority material matters, and one (1) additional 

matter were presented to the Board for their validation and received endorsement in December 2018.  

HGC will continue to disclose detailed ESG performance of its operations based on these seven sustainability matters. 

Annual review of these material matters will be performed to ensure continued relevance to our business. 

 

FIGURE 2: HGC MATERIALITY MATRIX AND MAPPING TO GRI STANDARDS DISCLOSURES 

 

 

Approach to Sustainability  

 

Operating in the vibrant and dynamic hospitality industry, we are cognizant of our businesses’ impact to the 

environment. HGC continually strives to enhance our management approach to address key areas in our operations 

that affect the way we create and share value.  

Sustainability is integrated into our business model. The approach we take is differentiated according to each 

sustainability matter. The Group is responsible for setting fundamental, group-wide policies in Corporate Governance 

and Human Resources. Our hotels are locally managed and the respective General Managers will take the lead in 

setting relevant local targets, managing sustainability practices and tracking performance of initiatives related to data 

security, resource consumption, and health and safety. The combined sustainability performance at Group level is 

overseen by Ms. Tan Hwa Lian (Executive Director) who reports to the Board quarterly.

Board Statement 

 

The Board considers sustainability matters as part of the Group’s strategic formulation. In 2017, the Board together 

with the management determined six material Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) matters which have 

the most impacts on our value chain and stakeholders. After internal review, the Board has confirmed the continued 

relevance of those matters in 2018.  The Board exercises oversight in the management and monitoring of the 

material ESG matters. The respective management team at each hotel ensures established policies and procedures 

in relation to those matters. The performance is closely monitored and reported to the Board on an annual basis.

1. Commitments to sustainability supported by strong governance 

1. Business Ethics and Anti-corruption 

 

We believe that good and effective governance is essential to protecting stakeholders’ interests and brand reputation. 

The Group is committed to upholding the highest standards of corporate governance and has zero tolerance towards 

any act of corruption or other improprieties that may include fraud, bribery and / or any violations of our internal 

policies.  

Key principles of honesty, integrity, fairness and respect are ingrained in our Code of Conduct and other related policies, 

which are included in our Employee Handbook. This Handbook conveys the tone from top which guides employees on 

the expected conduct in their day-to-day routine and interactions with various stakeholders. Made available upon 

employment, all employees will have to read, abide and acknowledge with a sign off to the principles and rules therein.  

Our policies will be reviewed annually by the Management whereby changes made are relayed to employees in a 

timely manner. Annual internal and external audits conducted allow us to ensure that policies are being implemented 

effectively. We record zero confirmed cases of corruption reported through the whistle-blowing channel in FY2018. 

The Group will continue to upkeep this track record.  

 

TABLE 2: POLICIES ON BUSINESS ETHICS AND ANTI-CORRUPTION 

Code of Conduct 

Policy on Whistle Blowing 

The Code sets out the expectations of employees to 

perform duties in a responsible and professional 

manner, to promote and protect the reputation of our 

brand as well as to act appropriately when conflicts 

arise. 

This group-wide policy provides a channel for 

employees and third-parties to report in confidence, 

without fear of reprisals, concerns about possible 

improprieties in financial reporting or other matters. 

 

2. Security of Information 

 

Maintaining the confidentiality and safeguarding privacy of our guests is paramount to us. Each country maintains 

their local Standard Operating Procedures (“SOP”) which follows local regulations on security of information and 

personal data protection. Reviewed annually, these SOPs govern how our hotels collect, use, disclose, store and give 

access to personal information, which may include guest details, credit card information, employee’s personal 

information and vendor price agreements. Hotels also strictly comply with record-keeping laws and credit card security 

standards of merchant banks. 

As we continue to emphasise importance of data privacy and security of information, training on best practices is 

provided to all employees. For employees such as our Reception staff who frequently collect personal data and 

information, additional training will be provided as appropriate.

To further our commitment to data privacy and security, server controls have been outsourced to a third-party service 

provider. Access management is determined by the General Manager, and entry is granted based on role requirements.

At any given time, access is limited to designated persons-in-charge on a need-to-know basis. Our Information 

Technology (“IT”) consultants also ensure that our systems are up-to-date by conducting regular upgrades on servers, 

email exchange systems and Windows Systems. These allow us to detect and prevent new threats and minimise cyber 

risks.  

Commencing in FY2019, System Crash exercises will be initiated to test the effectiveness of back up and information 

recovery procedures. We also plan for general IT environment controls audit by independent consultants. In FY2018, 

there has been no substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy and loss of customer data at all 

our hotels. 

2. Ensuring Fair Employment Practices 

1. Profile of our Workforce 

 

With the inclusion of HGC Townsville, we have restated our figures in 2017 for a like-for-like comparison. Our 

workforce has remained relatively stable, with a slight increase from 804 to 812 employees in FY2018. The percentage 

of female increased from over 50% to 55% of the workforce this year which reflects our efforts in achieving fair 

employment practices and promoting gender diversity.

TABLE 4: BREAKDOWN OF EMPLOYEES BY EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT AND EMPLOYMENT TYPE 

 

We aim to provide stable employment for our people. In FY2018, 91% of our employees are employed on a permanent 

contract. 60% of our employees work full-time. 40% of part-timers mostly are contract staff who join our hotels on an 

ad-hoc basis for events. These are F&amp;B attendants engaged during large-scale events, like banquets, conferences or 

restaurant service. In New Zealand, part-time employees also include students from Pacific International Hotel 

Management School who are on their industry placement program.

Total New Hires in FY2018: 257 

Total New Hire Rate: 32% 

 

Total Turnovers in FY2018: 269 

Total Turnover Rate: 33% 

 

Note: Total new hire and total turnover rate is calculated as a percentage of staff on payroll as of 31 December 2018.  

 

In FY2018, total turnover rate was recorded at 33%. Across the region, Australia and New Zealand accounts for highest 

turnover rate at 39% as compared to Singapore at 22%. Banquets and large-scale conferences are only held at hotels 

in Australia and New Zealand. Due to the seasonality of such events, temporary employees will then be hired to meet 

manpower demands, especially in the banqueting department. This employment model best suits the hotels’ 

operations as it allows for staffing flexibility. In addition, temporary employees are mostly made up of tourists and 

university students who take on ad-hoc jobs as a source of income. Subsequently, they leave our hotels when visas 

expire and when students graduate, moving to a permanent position elsewhere. This pool of temporary employees is 

mostly below the age of 30 which corresponds to the 50% turnover rate when broken down by age.  

In Singapore hotels, a 22% turnover rate is due to the tight labour market for the hospitality industry.  Many hotel 

positions such as room attendants, F&amp;B service staff and kitchen staff are filled by foreign labour on a two-year 

contract. Hence, turnover rates would be greatly affected when their contract ends.

2. Employment Practices and Benefits 

 

Human capital is our greatest asset. We value our employees and acknowledge that every individual plays a critical 

role towards the continued success of HGC. We strive to provide a safe and conducive environment, opportunities for 

growth, and adequate channels to voice their concerns.  

TABLE 5: GROUP POLICY ON EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND BENEFITS 

Workplace Diversity and Harassment Policy (applicable to all hotels) 

• 

Includes strict guidelines on prevention of workplace harassment, discrimination and bullying  

• 

Covers procedures for complaints and feedback through formal and informal resolution processes 

• 

All employees are required to sign off and abide to all provisions set out in the policy.  

 

HGC believes in enabling employees to develop to the full extent of their capabilities. Through a two-pronged 

approach, we strive towards improving employees’ skills and competencies. In addition, we recognise potential and 

offer professional development opportunities within the Company. Outstanding employees will be recognised and 

rewarded for their contribution, commitment and service to our hotels. 

 

FIGURE 7: HGC'S APPROACH TOWARDS TRAINING AND PERFORMANCE REVIEWS 

 

Education, Training and Coaching 

 

Performance  Management 

• 

Employees follow structured induction 

program which covers formal orientation 

workshop, on-the-job training and time with 

managers to discuss on job scope and 

expectations.  

 

• 

Specific training sessions on areas such as 

Occupational Health, Safety and Welfare and 

Discrimination and Harassment 

• 

Performance appraisals are held at the end of 

probationary period and annually thereafter. 

• 

Managers will discuss general performance, strengths 

and areas for improvements. 

• 

Employees are encouraged to actively partake in 

discussion on personal reviews, development goals 

and job concerns. 

 

We further our commitment to equal opportunity for all by ensuring that each one of our employees has equal 

access to employment, training and promotion benefits while working with us regardless of race, colour, religion, 

age, gender, sexual preference, disability or other matters unrelated to work performance. HGC provides a 

comprehensive list of employment benefits for full-time employees ranging from healthcare, parental leave, long 

term service benefits to retirement provisions. For more details, please refer to Table 4 of HGC SR2017.

3. Providing a healthy and safe environment for all 

Creating a healthy and safe environment is our commitment to both our guests and our employees. To do so, HGC 

management ensures robust health and safety management safety is established and maintained at each hotel. The 

system is designed in accordance to best practices and in compliance to all relevant laws and regulations. In FY2018, 

we have not identified any non-compliance with regulations and voluntary codes related to health and safety.  

Australia and New Zealand  

The local Health and Safety Committee maintains oversight on health and safety management system.  The Committee 

which comprises senior management, employee representatives from each operational department, WHS Officers, 

and Human Resources (“HR”) Personnel are also responsible for promoting a positive safety culture among colleagues 

and employees.  

A formalised incident reporting channel is administered across all hotels. This provides employees with an avenue to 

raise concerns or report potential risks to health and safety at work. The Committee meets monthly to review risk 

assessments and injury incident reports, near miss and other safety concerns raised. At these meetings, follow-up 

plans will be discussed, and corrective actions carried out as required.

Case Study: When enough is enough  

At HGC Adelaide, a new in-house training workshop – ‘Navigating when enough is enough’ was introduced in 

FY2018. The objective of the workshop was to share experiences regarding tricky or difficult situations which 

employees may find themselves in. It was targeted at employees such as Duty Managers / Night Managers / Night 

Auditors or others who either work alone or have end-responsibility and are decision makers. 


 

13 

 



Annual routine audits are conducted internally by Committee members and by external parties to assess and evaluate 

safety and hotel emergency response procedures. During the internal audit, incidents and their corrective actions were 

reviewed to ensure that the root cause has been adequately addressed to prevent reoccurrences. Any changes made 

to the SOPs will be communicated to relevant staff in a timely manner and appropriate training will be arranged.  

 

Case Study: Inculcating a culture of Health, Safety and Wellness at HGC Adelaide 

 

In September 2018, HGC Adelaide launched the first edition 

of their monthly Workplace Health &amp; Safety newsletter 

focusing on topics regarding employee welfare, safety and 

health. Every month, different WHS topics will be updated to 

reflect a specific focus of the month or to inform employees 

on certain news. The newsletter also shares news and tips to 

improve employees’ wellbeing and lifestyle.  

There is also a segment which celebrates employees’ 

birthdays and recognises employees for their length of 

service at HGC Adelaide.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Singapore 

In Singapore, our Workplace Health and Safety Committees partner with key staff members to undertake risk 

assessments to manage risks to health and safety associated with the work activities and tasks carried out by 

employees in our hotel. Subsequently, the necessary controls will be developed for each identified safety hazard. This 

process is reviewed every three years to ensure that our activities are compliant with the Workplace Safety and Health 

(“WSH”) Act enforced by the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”). We have an Internal Fire Safety Committee comprising 

trained fire wardens and fire fighters working together with our Company Emergency Response Team (CERT). In light 

of regulatory updates and changes, committee members proactively take actions to update existing procedures to 

ensure the hotel’s remained compliance.

Fire drills conducted twice a year for hotel guests and employees  

• 

Maintain appropriate fire certificates  

 

Performance 

As with FY2017, we are pleased to announce that there were zero fatalities and occupational diseases across all three 

regions in FY2018.  

Due to more large-scale events and banquets, our hotels in Australia and New Zealand generally record higher injury 

and lost day rates in comparison to Singapore hotels where events are limited to breakfast service and conferences.  

At those events, employees are potentially exposed to health and safety risks like cuts, burns, sprains, trips and falls. 

At each hotel, local WHS committees conduct monthly meetings to review and investigate any incidents so that 

corrective and mitigating actions can be done. Where necessary, risk assessments will be conducted regularly to 

mitigate hazards and employees are reminded to exercise caution when carrying out their tasks.  

In Australia, there were three incidents at HGC Hobart where two employees sustained injuries from slip and trips and 

one staff suffered a back injury while on housekeeping duties. The three employees required a longer recovery time 

which contributed to higher lost day count in FY2018. Since the incidents, the respective hotels have taken appropriate 

follow-up actions to remind employees to be alert while walking across slippery surfaces or going about their daily 

duties. Housekeeping employees are also reminded on safe work practices and manual handling training has been 

conducted regularly.  

In New Zealand, an increase was also recorded for injury frequency rate and lost day rate in FY2018. Injuries are usually 

sustained from kitchen duties (resulting in cuts, burns and bruises) or housekeeping duties (resulting in sprains or 

strains). Corrective actions have been implemented to ensure that kitchen staff are reminded of safe work practices. 

Tasks are demonstrated, and safety manuals are provided to ensure procedures are followed. Housekeeping staff are 

trained to exercise extra caution when moving heavy or fragile items and to use the correct chemicals to prevent slips 

and falls. First-Aid kits have been strategically placed within the premises to enable immediate treatment of minor 

injuries. 

In Singapore, we have maintained zero cases of workplace injuries for three consecutive years now – FY2016, FY2017, 

FY2018 – a record which we aim to keep in the years to come.

4. Managing the Use of Our Natural Resources 

Our environment policy highlights the commitment in meeting our environmental and social responsibilities. We 

continue to take a proactive approach to reduce the environmental impact from our business operations with various 

initiatives in waste reduction and energy efficiency improvement. 

 

1. Energy Consumption and GHG Emissions 

 

FIGURE 9: VARIOUS ENERGY-EFFICIENT AND POWER REDUCTION INITIATIVES ACROSS REGIONS 

Practices 

  Australia 

Energy Efficiency Initiatives   

• 

Replacement and upgrade of existing equipment to 

higher energy efficiency or star-rated equivalent 

upon end of life  

o light emitting diode (“LED”) lights 

o Hot water tanks and units  

• 

Replacement and upgrading of components in chiller 

and cooling towers  

• 

Installation of motion-activated sensors at back 

of house areas 

• 

Use of variable-frequency drive pumps to reduce 

energy required to circulate water  

• 

Use of motion-detecting thermostats and timers 

to operate HVAC systems 

• 

Shut down of air-conditioning units in large 

function and accommodation rooms during low 

season subject to occupancy 

 

2 With the inclusion of HGC Townsville, safety performance statistics for Australia has been restated to allow for like-for-like comparison between 

both years. 

3 Based on International Labor Organization (ILO) Standard, Injury Frequency Rate is calculated as the total number of fatal and non-fatal 

workplace injuries over 1,000,000 hours multiplied by the total number of manhours worked in the reference group during the reporting period. 

First aid injury is excluded in the calculation. 

4 Based on ILO Standard, Lost Day Rate is calculated as the total number of man days lost to workplace accidents over 1,000,000 hours multiplied 

by total number of manhours worked in the reference group during the reporting period. 

5 Absentee Rate is the total absentee days lost, relative to the total days scheduled to be worked by the employees in the reporting period, 

expressed as a percentage. 

6 Gender breakdown is unavailable for Singapore hotels in FY2017.

• 

As part of our commitment towards sustainable infrastructure, all our buildings have received green mark 

certification in recognition for their environmentally friendly design and construction. The building design 

allows for the usage of natural ventilation wherever possible.  

• 

Reduced air-conditioning temperatures when guests are not around. 

• 

Emphasising energy-saving habits such as switching off computers when not in use and limiting the use of 

other electronic appliances. 

• 

Placing hot and cold drinking water dispensers in all rooms.  These units consume less electricity as compared 

to the use of a traditional kettle. 

 

Fuel Consumption 

In FY2018, fuel consumption only happens in two Singapore hotels and JCHGC in New Zealand. They are attributed to 

the diesel oil used at two Singapore hotels for standby electrical generators, and natural gas used in the kitchen and 

motor gasoline used by vehicles7 owned by JCHGC in New Zealand. Our three hotels in Australia did not consume any 

fuel. 

In FY2018, we recorded a total of 6,499 GJ of direct energy consumed in Singapore and New Zealand, translating to 

460 tonnes of carbon dioxide (“CO2”)8 emission. A corresponding decrease in both energy intensity and Scope 1 GHG 

Emissions Intensity (per guest room) is reflected in Figure 9 below.  

 

 

 

 

7 The cars are provided for senior executives (General Manager and Sales Director) at the hotels.  

8 Emissions disclosed here are Scope 1 GHG emissions which come from sources that are owned or controlled by Hotel Grand Central. This relates 

to diesel oil, natural gas and motor gasoline and is expressed in tones of CO2. For New Zealand, emission factor is obtained from the “Guidance 

for Voluntary Corporate Greenhouse Gas Reporting – 2016”, published by the Ministry for the Environment, New Zealand. For Singapore, 

emission factors were adopted from IPCC Emission Factor Database 2006.

Electricity Consumption  

Although HGC saw an increase in higher occupancy rates in FY2018, our electricity consumption11 has remained 

relatively constant. A total of 21,418 MWh of electrical energy was consumed in FY2018, translating to 8,478 tonnes 

of carbon dioxide (“CO2”) emissions. 12 Moving forward, HGC endeavours to explore and adopt more energy-efficient 

initiatives to improve its energy intensity and lower GHG emissions across all three regions.  

 

 

 

 

 

9 FY2017 direct energy consumption have been restated to reflect the accurate consumption levels. 

10 FY2017 Scope 1 GHG emissions have been restated to utilise country specific emission factors in New Zealand.  

11 Scope 2 GHG emission is emission from the generation of electricity consumed by the organisation. In Singapore, grid emission factor is 

obtained from “2018 Singapore Energy Statistics”, published by the Energy Market Authority of Singapore. In Australia, the local grid emission 

factors of South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland are used. Data is obtained from the “Australian National Greenhouse Accounts Factors”, 

published by the Department of the Environment and Energy of Australia in 2018. In New Zealand, grid emission factor is obtained from the 

“Guidance for Voluntary Corporate Greenhouse Gas Reporting – 2016”, published by the Ministry for the Environment, New Zealand. 

12 Due to an update in Australia’s grid emission factors, we recorded an increase in GHG emissions even though total electrical consumption 

decreased.

Singapore  

Water-saving initiatives 

Monitoring and Review 

• 

As part of Green Mark certification, all bathroom fittings 

and cisterns installed are at minimum least WELS14-

certified two-tick rating to ensure optimal water use 

efficiency 

• 

Use of non-potable water only for landscaping in our 

hotels 

• 

Use of internal monitoring system to detect 

and prevent leaks in the building  

• 

Monthly review of utility bills and inspections 

on premises 

 

 

Throughout our operations, water used by our hotels is withdrawn from municipal water sources. It is used for daily 

hotel operations, which includes cooking, cleaning, maintenance and use in hotel equipment. Due to the conscious 

efforts of respective hotels, water consumption has decreased slightly from 177,139 m3 in FY2017 to 176,000 m3 in 

 

14 The Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme (WELS) is a mandatory scheme introduced by the Public Utilities Board (PUB) to inform consumers to 

promote water the use of water efficient system. More information on WELS can be obtained from 

https://www.pub.gov.sg/Documents/WELS_Brochure_English.pdf

FY2018 notwithstanding an increase in room occupancy in Australia. We look towards sensible use of water resources 

and maintain this downward trend.  

 

FIGURE 12: WATER CONSUMPTION15 BY OPERATING COUNTRIES 

 

 

Case Study: From Room Service to Green Service 

 

Across our Australian and New Zealand hotels, guests have the option to opt for a 

“Green Service” which means that replacement of towels, linens and bed sheets will 

be done only upon request. With the introduction of this initiative, this reduces water 

consumption as well as cleaning agents used. Currently, JCHGC who request for this 

service would be presented with a token of appreciation for their support – dining 

vouchers for use at Whitby’s Restaurant and Bar.

3. Waste Management 

 

Waste generation is one of the top concerns in the hospitality industry. Across our hotels, respective management 

teams continuously seek innovative ways to combat this issue and find solutions to reduce, reuse and recycle waste 

generated. Waste disposal across all hotels is done through third-party contractors. All wastes are non-hazardous 

wastes; comprising of general waste and grease traps. The hotels also have system in place to collect recyclables such 

as cardboard, paper, plastic and glass.  

 

Practices 

  Australia 

Waste management initiative  

Training and Awareness 

• 

Routine checks on waste bins for proper waste 

segregation to limit costly collection of general 

waste bins by contractors to three times a week 

• 

Proper disposal of organic waste by third-party 

contractors 

• 

On-site conversion of food waste to fertiliser 

through Pulpmaster food waste recycling system 

• 

Recycling of cooking oil instead of direct disposal 

• 

Reduction in use of single-use containers for 

conferences and functions 

• 

Recycling of all paper and cardboard products 

• 

Training of all employees with potential to 

encounter contaminated waste on correct 

handling and disposal  

 

New Zealand  

Waste management initiative 

Training and Awareness  

• 

Regular inspections to ensure waste management 

practices are implemented and executed 

• 

Have dedicated hotel Green Team working with 

hotel staff for wider waste minimisation 

awareness 

Benchmarking  

• 

Benchmark against Earthcheck waste generation baseline of 1.52 kg/guest night  

• 

Actual consumption is recorded at 0.71kg/guest night, 53% lower than baseline 

 

Singapore  

Waste management initiative  

• 

Reduce single-use plastic through installation of water and soap dispenser systems installed in hotel rooms 

• 

Where possible, paper waste generated from day to day activities is recycled by an external contractor 

• 

Waste generated from coffee is donated to a local organic farm for the purpose of reuse as compost 

 

In FY2018, HGC recorded a 4% decrease in waste generated. Although we experienced increase in occupancy rates, 

waste generation level has been kept to a minimum. More than half (54%) of waste generated is disposed of through 

means of recycling, composting and incineration. Moving forward, HGC remains committed towards proper waste 

management through exploring alternative disposal methods and lowering amount of waste diverted to landfills in 

Australia and New Zealand.

FIGURE 13: TOTAL WASTE GENERATED16 CATEGORISED BY DISPOSAL METHODS 

 

 

Case Study: Single-use no more 

 

To reduce single-use plastics at events, HGC Brisbane partnered with 

Purezza Sparkling Water System to provide a 100% reusable, sustainable 

solution for participants during conferences and functions. This feature 

is popular with eventgoers, as shown by  higher than average booking 

rates for these functions rooms to hold events.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 Waste generation has been restated FY2017 to include data for HGC Townsville, showing a like-for-like comparison. Additionally, HGC 

Adelaide and HGC Brisbane data has been restated for FY2017, reflecting accurate numbers.
