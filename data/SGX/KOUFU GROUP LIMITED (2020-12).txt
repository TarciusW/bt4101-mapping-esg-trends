ABOUT

KOUFU GROUP LIMITED



Founded in 2002 by Mr. Pang Lim and headquartered in Singapore, Koufu Group 

Limited (“Koufu”) has been one of Singapore’s most well-known operators and 

managers of food courts and coffee shops. Since July 2018, Koufu has been listed 

on the Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”).

Our business comprises of two segments – Outlet &amp; Mall Management and Food &amp; 

Beverages (“F&amp;B”) Retail. Under the Outlet &amp; Mall Management business segment, 

Koufu operates and/or manages food courts, coffee shops, a hawker centre and 

a commercial mall. Under the F&amp;B Retail business segment, we operate F&amp;B stalls 

located within food courts and coffee shops, as well as F&amp;B kiosks, quick-service 

restaurants and full-service restaurants. Our brands include Cookhouse, Elemen, 

R&amp;B Tea, Grove and many more.

Koufu (口福) refers to the Chinese belief that it is one’s good fortune to feast on 

good food. Using the same belief to bring forth ‘Koufu’ to everyone, we make 

it our mission to offer accessible good food and services steeped in traditional 

Singaporean cuisine and culture.

STATEMENT 

FROM THE BOARD

SUSTAINABILITY 

HIGHLIGHTS IN FY2020

The Board of Directors (“the Board” or 

“We”) of Koufu Group Limited (“Koufu” or 

“the Group”) is pleased to present you our 

second Sustainability Report for the financial 

year ended 31 December 2020 (“FY2020”).

The report highlights the Group’s steadfast commitment 

towards our sustainability goals amidst the social and 

economic disruptions brought about by the Coronavirus 

Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic. Our responses to 

the social impact of COVID-19 have also been detailed 

in this report.

As sustainability is of strategic interest to our business, 

the Board continues to oversee the management and 

monitoring of material sustainability matters. Having 

considered the impact of COVID-19 on the business, the 

Board has determined that the material environmental, 

social and governance (“ESG”) matters remain relevant for 

Koufu. Additionally, we have added Energy and Emissions 

as a sustainability reporting matter to reinforce the vital 

importance of protecting the environment – a shared 

and valuable resource.

The Board will continue to monitor the impact of 

COVID-19 and economic outlook closely with the 

aim of advancing our sustainability purpose across the 

business. We would also like to take this opportunity to 

thank our stakeholders for their continued confidence 

and support towards Koufu over the years.

available, performance for the financial year ended 31 December 2019 (“FY2019”) has been included for comparative

While we have adopted a phased approach for reporting, we seek to progressively expand our scope to include our global 

operations as we mature in our journey of sustainability reporting.

KOUFU’S 

SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH

Materiality Assessment

For our second year of reporting, we conducted a review on our sustainability matters and assessed its continued 

relevance to our business. Through our review, we concluded that the material matters reported in FY2019 remain 

relevant to our business in FY2020.

This year, Koufu has included an additional reporting matter, Energy and Emissions, given its rising importance 

across our business and to our stakeholders.

Identification

A preliminary list of 

sustainability matters was 

collated based on desktop 

analysis of sustainability 

reports published by industry 

players. Subsequently, these 

matters were discussed with 

management to distil those 

that were relevant to Koufu.

Prioritisation

In allocating weightage to the 

sustainability matters identified in step 

1, we have engaged an independent 

consultant to facilitate a materiality 

assessment workshop involving senior 

management and key members across 

several departments. This workshop 

allowed us to prioritise matters 

according to the likelihood and extent 

of impact to our business whilst taking 

into consideration the perception of 

both internal and external stakeholders.

Validation

Results from the materiality 

assessment workshop were 

presented in a materiality 

matrix and validated by the 

Board.

Review

The validated sustainability 

matters will undergo yearly 

review to ensure that these 

remain relevant and important 

to Koufu’s business and our 

stakeholders.

BETTER FOOD

Koufu is committed to provide 

only safe, high-quality food and 

service. Therefore our priority 

is to maintain high standards 

of food safety and hygiene by 

complying with all food and safety 

regulations across our sites. Only 

by reinforcing this commitment, 

Koufu will consolidate into a trusted 

brand for individuals and families.

Policy

Koufu is committed to providing food safety for our customers. 

We will strictly ensure that food safety practices are adhered 

to across our factories and retail outlets in accordance with 

Koufu’s Food Safety Policy. 

Targets

› 

Zero major2 food safety incidents at Koufu’s outlets

› 

SFA Grade “A” license at new proposed Integrated  

 

Facility3 by FY2021

Practices

We have established a standardised approach in guiding our employees and tenants on food safety 

and hygiene practices, and procedures that should be followed across our food operations. Regular 

evaluation procedures are also implemented to ensure adherence (refer to Table 4). In addition, we 

are currently working towards obtaining the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (“HACCP”) and 

ISO22000 food safety management certification for our proposed integrated facility.

Should any non-compliance incident be raised by the Singapore Food Agency (“SFA”), our Food Hygiene 

Manager (“FHM”) and Zone Trainer will investigate the incident, and subsequently educate the parties 

involved. The Service Manager (“SM”) then monitors and ensures that corrective actions are implemented 

within 24 hours and communicates the progress to the Food Court Manager (“FCM”), FHM and Zone 

Trainer.

2 

A major food safety incident is defined as Mass Food Poisoning deemed to have occurred when at least five unrelated customers are affected from 

consuming food items produced by the Central Kitchen supplying to our retail outlets.

3 

Our proposed Integrated Facility will expand the central procurement, preparation, processing and distribution functions of our existing central kitchens 

to manufacture and supply semi-finished and/or finished food products to our food courts and self-operated F&amp;B.

food by expiration or ‘use-by’ date adopted for our 

food ingredients to minimise wastage

› Food preparation carried out under strict temperature-

controlled environment

› Our central kitchens are thoroughly washed down 

and cleaned at the end of each day

› Visual quality control checks are conducted at every 

stage to ensure freshness of our foods en-route to the 

packaging station, where a final check is conducted 

› Inspection conducted 3 times weekly by the FHM, 

quality assurance team and factory manager

Outlet Management 

and F&amp;B Retail

› All Koufu’s service personnel are to adhere to food 

quality and safety procedures per the Group’s and 

NEA’s Food Hygiene guidelines, such as, the daily 

completion of food hygiene checklist for individual 

stall owners/tenants 

› Chefs and kitchen staff involved in the food preparation 

are provided training on food handling, cooking and 

hygiene control

› Daily visual quality control checks are also conducted 

on the F&amp;B products served

› FCMs and Floor Managers conduct daily routine 

inspections to uphold the level of cleanliness and 

hygiene standards consistently

Qualifications Requirements 

At Koufu, our employees and tenants must be equipped with the necessary Workforce Skills Qualifications (“WSQ”) (refer 

to Table 5) before commencing work at Koufu or at Koufu’s premises.

Table 5: WSQ qualifications requirement

COVID-19 and Food Safety

With regards to COVID-19 transmission through food products, the 

Singapore Food Agency (“SFA”) recommends that food should be 

cooked thoroughly before eating. 

Similarly, the environment that humans interact with can be easily 

contaminated with the COVID-19 virus, including contact with food 

or food packaging and equipment, or contact with other non-food 

packaging and the environment. As part of our COVID-19 response, 

our employees and tenants at our central kitchens and outlets were 

reminded to adhere strictly to SFA’s food handling requirements and to 

always keep their masks on. Outlet managers and our factory managers 

make additional rounds daily to check and ensure that food handlers 

are in compliance.

Case Study: Prevention and 

mitigation of pests

Since the beginning, regular pest control has 

been a consistent commitment of ours to 

maintain the confidence of our customers 

in the quality of our food and to ensure a 

hygienic and comfortable environment for 

our patrons to dine at our food courts and 

self-operated F&amp;B outlets. We engaged 

third party pest control services regularly, 

even during the Covid-19 lockdown period 

– weekly for the food courts, fortnightly 

for central kitchen and on an ad-hoc 

basis for the self-operated F&amp;Bs. Through 

this, potential pests harbourage areas are 

eliminated.

In addition, the FHM conducts regular 

internal checks to ensure our outlets 

remain pest-free. In cases where pests are 

identified either through internal checks 

or through feedback raised by employees 

or customers, pest-control services are 

engaged immediately to mitigate the issue.

Performance4

In FY2020, we achieved zero major food safety incidents across Koufu’s outlets. However, there was a non-compliance 

case relating to housekeeping which resulted in a fine from NEA. To avoid re-occurrence, FCMs have been instructed to 

perform additional daily housekeeping inspections, in particular, for the stall that received the fine.

With the upholding of good housekeeping and hygiene standards in mind, we continue to work towards our goal of 

obtaining the SFA Grade “A” license for our Integrated Facility by end FY2021.

 Our performance only includes cases where Koufu has direct operational control over (i.e. excludes tenants).

Tracking of feedback received

Koufu takes value in every feedback that we receive as they serve as a reminder to consistently evaluate our product 

offerings and services in bringing our customers a better dining experience. Below are extracts of feedback the Group 

received in FY2020.

Hi. I was buying lunch at the fish soup stall at 

Woodlands mart earlier and was charged 20c 

extra for fish soup beehoon. I thought koufu 

advertised that there will not be extra charge for 

take away box? Or was that just for show?

Hi, I would like to feedback that I bought 

3 packets of Fishball Meepok from Koufu 

yesterday evening, and am disappointed that all the 

fishball are not fresh. Fish ball taste weird and bland 

for the 3 boxes, can tell is not fresh. I hope the stall 

can do quality check or do not use leftover fishball 

from overnight to consumer during this Circuit 

Breaker period as I know the business have dropped 

alot. Not asking for refund but just want to feedback.

Dear Sir/Madam, 

I wish to complement one of your 

service staff for her best service. Karen 

is working at the 768 Woodlands Mart store 

with the drink store. She is always so courteous, 

fast in her work and friendly with customers. What 

impresses me most is she remembers every of her 

regular customers order, which goes to show how 

dedicated she is at her work. I have been a returning 

customer to this Koufu outlet precisely because 

of this “Human” touch that Karen provides. She 

makes it a joy to visit Koufu and I do hope your 

kind Management may convey my sincere 

appreciation for her hard efforts. 

Thank you.

Hi Koufu,

Just to put on record my deepest 

appreciation for the help given by Zhi 

Lim, Asst Manager of 168 Koufu Punggol 

Plaza. I got his contact through a communication 

regarding a collection of my Lontong which I was 

billed wrongly. He allowed me to collect my food this 

week through Ms Kelly. Though he was on leave today, 

he attended to my needs in locating my 3 masks misplaced 

by my spouse at the food court. He got his colleagues for 

help and texted me within 3 minutes - we found it. He is 

very conscientious in his work because most staff will 

put on hold till he is back to work. It has cut short my 

hubby’s worry and also my nag henceforth preventing 

a dispute. Thank you for his concerted effort and 

kindly convey our sincere appreciation. Kudos 

and may Koufu flourish and prosper.

Performance

In FY2020, Koufu met our target of less than 35 complaints per month. Compared to FY2019, the number of compliments 

and complaints received in FY2020 both decreased by 72% and 61% respectively. The reduction in feedback received was 

attributed to the COVID-19 circuit breaker and restrictions which resulted in a significant drop in footfall and reduced 

interactions with our customers. Further to that, in light of the COVID-19 situation, we have temporarily suspended our 

mystery shopper audit for FY2020 until further notice.

Action taken: Koufu acknowledged the 

oversight and offered a refund. The stall 

operator was also issued a warning.

Action taken: Koufu highlighted this issue 

to the stall operator and worked with 

them to ensure better food quality moving 

forward.

BETTER PEOPLE

Our Workforce Profile

Koufu takes pride in our people as they are key contributors to the continuing success of our Group. We continue to take 

great efforts in ensuring that our workforce is resilient in numbers to adequately support our business, and especially so 

during this time of COVID-19 pandemic. This year, our permanent5 employee numbers decreased by 9.8% from 1,473 

in FY2019 to 1,328 in FY2020. There were significant variations6 in May 2020 due to the circuit breaker period, where a 

high turnover was observed. However, post circuit breaker, there was a significant increase in new hires in July 2020, 

allowing our workforce to regain its strength.

Being in the F&amp;B industry, Koufu also engages a significant number of workers who are not employees to support Koufu’s 

operations, comprising largely cleaning services and tenant operations. As at end FY2020, we engaged 491 cleaners and 

2,014 workers of tenants, a decrease of 14.5% from 574 cleaners and an increase of 2.3% from 1,968 workers of tenants 

in FY2019. Due to COVID-19, operating hours for the outlets had to be adjusted, which resulted in a decrease in number 

of cleaners following an adjustment in manpower deployment by the cleaning contractors.

Our employees are our greatest 

asset in the company and there is 

a strong emphasis on the need to 

engage them in meaningful ways, 

including enhancing their growth 

and commitment towards the 

success of the organisation. An 

engaged employee would have 

higher satisfaction, leading to 

increased productivity and therefore 

increased customer satisfaction.

Policy

Koufu believes that actively engaging our employees and 

the effort put in towards understanding them can enhance 

their overall level of satisfaction working for the Group. As 

such, our employee engagement policy is designed to help 

our employees grow individually and professionally while 

remaining committed to the growth of our organisation.

Targets

Total employees’ turnover rate8 not exceeding a monthly 

turnover rate of 4% in FY2021 

Practices

In order to attract and retain talents, we ensure that our remuneration packages remain attractive and 

competitive by benchmarking our salary packages against the Singapore National Employers Federation 

(“SNEF”) salary and benefits data.

Further to that, we seek to keep our employees actively engaged through various skill enhancement 

programmes, incentives and platforms for employees to share any suggestions or grievances they may have.

Maintaining an active employee engagement during COVID-19

As part of Koufu’s contingency plan, 

the IT Department readily provided 

technological support and ordered 

equipment to assist employees in 

working remotely from home. To 

enhance communication between 

employees working from home, video 

conferencing has also become the new 

normal for meetings conducted.

During the lockdown period, Koufu 

received an increase in concerns around 

job security and anxiety among 

our employees. In response, our HR 

team reassured them through regular 

communications that a retrenchment 

exercise would not be conducted. 

Instead, employees were given the 

option to work shorter hours or use 

annual leave as necessary to avoid 

impacting their basic salaries. For 

food courts that were affected in their 

operation during the Circuit Breaker 

period, such as those in the Central 

Business District (“CBD”), employees 

were transferred to other food courts 

where possible.

In terms of training and development, 

due to restrictions in size for face-to-

face classes in line with the COVID-19 

regulations, we have arranged for online 

classes as an alternative for in-house 

trainings conducted by Koufu’s Subject 

Matter Experts (SMEs). We further 

explored other formats of carrying 

out trainings such as ‘Train-the-Trainer’ 

sessions in complying with the reduced 

class size requirements.

Enhancing the capability of our workforce during COVID-19

In light of the COVID-19 situation 

which resulted in the increase in 

usage of online platforms, we have 

enabled relevant groups of employees 

to attend the SkillsFuture for Digital 

Workplace course to understand 

emerging technologies and how they 

impact daily work activities. It also aids 

our employees in embracing change, 

innovation and resilience during this 

period of transition.

A ‘Display Critical Thinking and 

Analytical Skills’ course was also held 

for the Headquarters (“HQ”) and middle 

management employees. The course 

aims to enhance critical thinking and 

analytical skills for problem solving. 

It also includes the challenging and 

rethinking of ideas, analysing business 

issues and enhancing creative thinking 

among team members.

In-house trainings for our service 

staff included trainings on the mobile 

application (i.e. Koufu Eat App) released 

by our Group to facilitate smoother 

business transactions at our food courts.

Due to Koufu’s nature of business in the F&amp;B industry, we are subjected to high rates of new employee hires and turnover. 

To better manage the turnover rate of our employees, we have set a target to not exceed a monthly turnover rate9 of 4%. 

We are pleased to share that we have met this target in FY2020, as well as in FY2019. In addition to the monthly turnover 

rate, the following additional metrics are tracked according to GRI Standards.

Safety and well-being of each of our 

employees is an essential priority 

at Koufu. The physical and mental 

wellness contributes strongly to 

the success of our operations and 

business. 

The Workplace Safety and Health 

(“WSH”) handbook contains all 

policies, roles and responsibilities 

regarding general safety measures, 

as well as reporting procedures at 

premises within the Group’s control.

Policy

Koufu is committed to excel in our workplace safety and 

health performance through inculcating a safety-first culture 

with the appropriate training and leadership development 

opportunities provided to our employees. Koufu also commits 

to implement safe practices and procedures that comply 

with the WSH Act and other relevant regulations.

All employees and contractors are expected to comply and 

align with Koufu’s WSH policy.

Targets

Practices

Workplace Safety and Health Management System (“WSHMS”)

Certified BizSAFE Level 4 and with reference to the Singapore Standard Occupational Safety and Health 

Management System (“SS506”), Koufu’s WSH handbook documents the Group’s occupational safety and 

health management system which consists of the Plan-Do-Check-Act (“PDCA”) model. The PDCA model 

serves to ensure sufficient oversight over the management of workplace safety across our operations. 

While our WSHMS system covers Koufu’s employees and contractors working at Koufu’s premises, our 

contractors are expected to have their own risk management plan before they are allowed to begin work 

for Koufu. Should any hazard or incident be located within Koufu’s premises, our contractors are advised 

to report to their supervisor and Koufu-in-charge.

Where COVID-19 is concerned, the CMT is responsible for managing the overall situation to safeguard human lives and 

ensure that necessary arrangements and coordination with authorities are in place. In February 2020, a memo was issued 

organisation-wide to provide guidance on the immediate measures to take just as Singapore changed its COVID-19 alert 

level to Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (“DORSCON”) Orange. The immediate measures taken at the HQ, 

central kitchen, food courts and self-operated F&amp;B outlets included practicing of personal hygiene, temperature checks 

twice a day, increased cleaning frequency on high touch points, travel declaration, etc. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, 

Koufu effected team segregation arrangements to reduce unnecessary physical contact between employees at the HQ.

In support of the Crisis Management Plan, our Outlet 

Evacuation Plan for COVID-19 outlines the procedure on 

the measures to take in three different scenarios:

Scenario 1:  Person is unwell and is incapable of leaving the 

workplace by himself/herself.

Scenario 2:  Person has fainted.

Scenario 3:  Person showing symptoms of having a temperature 

above 37 degrees or reports that he/she is not 

feeling well.

These three scenarios apply to anyone in the premises, 

whether it is an employee, tenant, customer, or contractor. 

The evacuation plan details the steps in which an outlet 

employee should take after assessing the scenario, which 

includes rendering of basic first aid, calling of ambulance 

and informing of the HR team to contact the patient’s 

next-of-kin, etc.

counter where congregation or queuing of employees 

or visitors might occur.

3. Flexible Work Arrangements such as Work from Home 

and staggered working hours were implemented.

Applicable to Factories only

1. Employees are to dine at the demarcated areas. They are 

to keep a distance of at least one metre from another 

individual. 

2. Physical distancing of at least one metre must also be 

applied to common areas. 

3. To adopt precautionary measures such as scheduling 

delivery times by different suppliers in a staggered 

manner.

4. Ensure that machinery and equipment shared between 

employees across different shifts or alternate teams are 

cleaned and disinfected before changing hands.

At Koufu’s food courts, the FCMs and SMs conduct rounds during operating hours to make sure that our tenants and 

customers abide by the safe distancing measures and limits imposed per table.

Should there be any cases of customers being tested positive with COVID-19, Koufu will abide by the Ministry of Health’s 

(“MOH”) directive on whether a NEA-approved cleaning agency is required to be engaged for the disinfection of the 

entire food court or self-operated F&amp;B outlet. Nonetheless, even when no directive from MOH is warranted, Koufu will 

engage our staff to conduct a thorough clean-up and disinfection of our premises as precaution.

Protecting our employees against COVID-19

At the HQ, all employees and visitors are required to have their 

temperature taken before entering. To facilitate this process, 

we have marked out 1-metre safe distancing on the floor using 

footprint stickers to guide employees, visitors or contractors to 

wait in line for their turn.

In addition to the safe management measures implemented within 

our facilities that are applicable to our employees, we ensure that 

our vendors go through temperature screening before entering 

our central kitchen. To do this, we have placed a signage with a 

telephone number at the delivery area which informs the vendor 

to call out the staff for a temperature check.

BETTER PEOPLE

Performance

For both FY2019 and FY2020, we are pleased to report that we met our target of zero fatalities for both employees and 

non-employee workers, as well as zero high-consequence work-related injuries for employees. However, in FY2020, 

there was a case of high-consequence work-related injury relating to the worker of a tenant who was unable to recover 

within 6 months from a hot liquid scalding incident at one of our food courts. To prevent re-occurrence of similar cases, 

our food court management staff have been briefed to remind our tenants about appropriate workplace safety measures, 

such as exercising caution when handling hot items.

Overall, in FY2020, the total number of recordable injury cases among the employees decreased by 1, while for non-

employee workers, it increased by 10. In response to the rise in workplace injury cases for our non-employee workers, 

majority of which are slips and falls, scalding and sprains, a committee meeting was held which resolved the need for a 

policy focusing on workplace safety enhancement. This policy, which is expected to be finalised by 3Q 2021 will cover 

enforcement of additional safety guidelines, such as wearing of safety shoes before entering into the kitchen.

Figure 10: Total number and rate15 of recordable employee and non-employee worker16 injury cases

15 Rate of recordable work-related injuries is calculated using the total number of recordable work-related injuries per 200,000 manhours worked, as 

defined by GRI Standards.

16 Total number of recordable non-employee injuries presented may not be whole as tenants may liaise directly with their insurance companies which 

are not within the purview of Koufu.

17 Koufu does not track the number of hours worked by non-employees, hence the assumption used is that each non-employee works 44 hours/week 

as per Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) regulations.

BETTER LIFE













As part of Koufu’s efforts towards 

sustainability, we recognise the 

importance of managing the 

environmental aspect of our 

operations. We strive to minimise 

our environmental impacts by 

managing our energy usage through 

innovation and technologies that 

promote efficiencies.

Policy

We are committed to managing our energy and emissions 

through technology and available resources to monitor, 

diagnose and evaluate energy efficiencies of our operations. 

We endeavor to monitor our performance and gradually 

transit towards alternative renewable energy sources in 

supplying clean energy to our food processing plants as 

we mature in our processes in years to come.

Targets

We are committed to adopting energy-efficient technologies 

from FY2021

Practices

The core of our energy consumption can be attributed to our three food processing plants which supply 

pre-cooked and cooked food items to Koufu’s food court and self-operated F&amp;B outlets:

• 

Gourmet – manufacturer of assorted dim sum and hot kitchen supplies

• 

DeliJoy – manufacturer of baked goods

• 

DeliAsia – manufacturer of ready to eat dough food items 

As part of our efforts to reduce energy consumption and consequently greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions 

released into the environment, we will be upgrading to energy efficient equipment at our new integrated 

facility which will commence operations in FY2021.

Practices

The Audit and Risk Management Committee (“ARMC”) is responsible for the development and monitoring 

of the Group’s risk management framework which covers various policies and procedures, and the review 

of potential risks faced by the Group. 

New directors, as part of Koufu’s management onboarding programme, will undergo a comprehensive 

orientation programme to familiarise with the company’s business and governance practices. While existing 

directors are required to attend at least one training course each year on corporate governance topics, 

conducted either by internal or external parties.

Annually, the Group also carries out an internal audit on our Group’s internal processes and controls 

performed by external consultants and separately, an external audit conducted by accredited independent 

auditors. In FY2020, Koufu is in the preparation stage of the Control Self-Assessment (“CSA”) which aims 

at enhance internal controls within the Group. With plans to be implemented in FY2021, realignment 

measures will be taken to bridge any gaps identified through the CSA.

For more information on corporate governance, please refer to the ‘Corporate Governance’ section of 

Koufu’s Annual Report 2020.

Compliance with laws and regulations

Our Group’s policies are reviewed annually to ensure its relevance to current practices and legislations in 

the countries we operate in. In addition, Koufu’s appointed external auditors will update the ARMC and 

the Board on revised or new regulations applicable to the Group annually. In light of COVID-19, Koufu 

has put in place Safe Management Measures in line with the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) and Ministry 

of Health (“MOH”) and Ministry of Trade and Industry’s (“MTI”) requirements. For more information on the 

safe management measures implemented at Koufu, please refer to the Occupational Health and Safety

compliance performance.

Ethics, Bribery and Corruption

Koufu takes a strong stand against corruption, with integrity being one of our core values. Our Code of 

Conduct acts as the first line of defense against unethical and corruption acts. Koufu does not condone 

any fraud, corruption and other forms of unethical behaviour or conduct. We urge all stakeholders to 

reach out to us at whistle-blowing@koufu.com.sg should any of such matters come to your attention. 

All reports lodged will be assessed directly by the ARMC Chairman. Internal stakeholders are advised to 

reach out to their immediate area managers, or contact the HR personnel, CEO or Executive Director.

Risk management, key risk exposures, and activities in respect of significant matters are being reviewed 

quarterly and checked that risks identified in the previous period have accordingly been mitigated and 

addressed. In addition, to ensure that our suppliers and contractors are aware of our anti-corruption 

requirements, the Group’s procurement team will communicate these requirements to them during the 

negotiation phase.

Performance23

Koufu is once again pleased to share that we have met our target of zero confirmed cases of corruption and cases 

involving non-monetary sanctions in FY2020 and FY2019. In addition, we do not have any cases brought through 

dispute resolution mechanisms over the past two years.

In FY2020, we have received two fines of $1000 each from MOM and SFA with regards to non-compliance on safe 

distancing measures at our corporate office and food court respectively. We have since taken additional measures to 

ensure safe distancing are adhered to at our office and food operations, increased cleaning frequency of high touch-

points and limit the need for employees to return to office, where possible. All FCMs of our food courts and F&amp;B outlets 

were also given directives to ensure dining tables and chair are adequately spaced out in complying with safe-distancing 

guidelines implemented by the government.

23 Excludes cases relating to food safety and hygiene. Please refer to Food Safety and Hygiene section for more information.

Strengthening of internal controls 

Given the recent acquisition of Deli Asia during the year, additional efforts will be taken to streamline 

business processes and align the internal control processes of Deli Asia’s with that of Koufu’s. The internal 

control review will be performed on Deli Asia’s processes including cash handling, bank management, 

kiosk operation management, revenue and receivables, and review of Central Kitchen Compliance 

Framework. Through this review process, we hope to identify and align the gaps in internal controls 

from Koufu and Deli Asia, as well as to streamline business processes between Deli Asia and Koufu.

Practices

Multi-brand strategy

As part of our sustainable business model, our current multi-brand strategy is built on top of our traditional 

food court management business to target various market segments concurrently, which enables expansion 

and development of our business on a wider scale in the long run. In addition, the multi-brand strategy 

caters to a diverse group of consumers in terms of taste, preferences, budgets and occasions, allowing 

us to capture a larger customer base and market share, both locally and globally. In FY2020, our overseas 

expansion plans were unmet as partnership opportunities were hindered due to COVID-19. Despite that, 

brand diversification continued for the markets that we currently operate in, including the introduction of 

the Supertea and R&amp;B Tea brands to the Philippines and Indonesia through master franchise and licensing 

agreement, congruent with our strategy to actively develop our concept brands in both local and overseas 

markets. In addition, the Group has also established our first R&amp;B Tea and Supertea outlets in Macau and 

Malaysia. The addition of Delisnacks and Dough Culture through the accretive acquisition of Deli Asia 

has further diversified the Group’s revenue and network expansion in complementary dim sum, snacks 

and dough products. Another notable development in FY2020 was our master franchise agreement with 

Shakey’s Pizza Asia Ventures Inc. which expanded the reach of our high growth tea and beverage brands. 

Riding on the healthy living and dining trend, we also plan to bring our natural meatless restaurant, Elemen, 

into overseas markets in the coming years.

Scale-up SG Programme

Identified as an enterprise with a track record of growth and potential, Koufu embarked on the 2.5-year 

programme in 2019 with an ambition to scale up and potentially contribute significantly to Singapore’s 

economy. As a pioneer of this programme, Koufu is committed to leverage on the resources provided 

to expand our operations in a sustainable manner while creating job opportunities for Singaporeans. In 

FY2020, we continued to witness a growth in the total number of outlets from 184 self-operated outlets 

in FY2019 to 199 self-operated outlets and 184 authorised/licensed outlets in FY2020, comprising both 

local and international outlets.

Innovative business transformation

To ensure that our business model stays relevant and attractive to the ever-changing market preferences 

and consumer habits brought about by COVID-19, Koufu continuously seeks to improvise our business 

offerings on various fronts. On the digital front, Koufu has launched its “Koufu Eat” mobile application which 

provides ease and value to customers who use the app to place orders. On the product enhancement 

front, we have extended our menu at Elemen and Grove to include bento boxes for takeaway in adapting 

to the COVID-19 situation and restrictions imposed for dine-in at these outlets.

BETTER LIFE













Maintaining a healthy economic 

performance provides confidence 

to our stakeholders through the 

enhancement of tangible value 

generated. It is vital that Koufu 

continues to generate economic 

value for its stakeholders while 

ensuring sustainability in the 

long-term in order to thrive in this 

competitive food service industry.

Policy

We are committed to achieving improved economic 

performance for the long-term sustainability of the Group 

in accordance to our mission, “Better Food, Better People,

COVID-19 measures for Koufu’s tenants

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected tenant-occupiers all over 

Singapore due to a sudden change in lifestyle and shopping 

habits. In response to this, the Ministry of Law of Singapore 

passed a COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) 

Act on 5 June 2020, providing a rental relief framework to 

help eligible tenant-occupiers who have been affected by 

COVID-19. There are two types of rental relief– rental relief 

supported by Government assistance and additional rental 

relief supported by landlords and property owners. Koufu 

has since passed down the rebates to our stall tenants across 

48 food courts and 18 coffee shops.

Caring for our Community

As one of the key food service providers in Singapore, we 

see the importance of giving a portion our success back to 

the community who has earnestly supported us through 

our years of operation. Besides, this has been an integral 

part of our mission since the inception of the Group. We 

believe that through our care for the community, we can 

help Singapore to recover and achieve betterment during 

this time of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

In FY2020, we invested a total of more than $60,000 

in community initiatives, including a $10,000 endowed 

bursary24 to the Singapore Institute of Technology. We have 

also clocked about 2,800 volunteer manhours through our 

initiatives such as the Food Bank Singapore’s Feed the City 

and #KoufuCares CSR programme.

(a) Food Bank Singapore’s Feed the City programme – 

supported by the DBS Stronger Together fund

In support of Food Bank Singapore’s Feed the City programme, 

the DBS Stronger Together fund involved a $10.5 million 

fund set up by DBS bank to help communities in Asia deeply 

impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In Singapore, a total 

of $2.5 million went towards putting food on the table of 

the elderly, low-income and migrant workers. As one of the 

partners in this initiative, Koufu provided food for the elderly 

and low-income families by assigning 25 stalls to prepare the 

food, and allocating bulk orders for participating stallholders, 

providing additional sales to their business. To date, Koufu 

has provided a total of 3,294 meals to beneficiaries.

(b) #KoufuCares CSR Programme

Since 29 April 2020, Koufu Group started the #KoufuCares 

CSR Programme to show appreciation to medical frontliners, 

migrant workers and those in need during the COVID-19 

pandemic. In order to fund these programmes, we rallied 

our employees to contribute funds to the ‘Giving Back A Bit 

of Love’ Charity Drive, an initiative that seeks to spread love 

and kindness by providing meals for frontliners in healthcare 

institutions and migrant workers. Please refer to below for 

more details.

24  Koufu has agreed to gift $40,000 of bursary in aggregate to the Singapore Institute of Technology over a period of four years from FY2019 to FY2020 

at $10,000 each year.

In May 2020, Koufu embarked on the ‘Giving Back A Bit of Love’ initiative, where our staff came together to raise 

funds to help those in need and to show appreciation to our frontliners and migrant brothers who were affected 

by the COVID-19 pandemic. With a total of $27,760 raised, all proceeds have gone towards providing food for the 

aforementioned beneficiaries. More than 7000 Koufu’s signature coffee and bun sets, 1000 main meals and 500 

bubble teas were distributed to show our appreciation for their sacrifice and hard work during these challenging times.

Performance

During the circuit breaker period, the operations of 10 food courts, 3 quick-service restaurants and 2 full-service restaurants 

were temporarily suspended in order to reduce operating costs. The Group also suspended operations of all but one R&amp;B tea 

kiosk, in line with the further tightening measures while the rest of the food courts and self-operated F&amp;B outlets remained 

open to cater for takeaways and food delivery services. Since June 2020, we have gradually resumed operations.

The decrease in our economic value generated and economic value retained in FY2020, as compared to FY2019, was largely 

attributed to the impacts of COVID-19 which saw two months of Circuit Breaker impacting all F&amp;B businesses. Nevertheless, 

Koufu’s resilient business model continued to ensure stable earnings during this challenging period.
