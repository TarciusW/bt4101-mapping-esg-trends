United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development, Our Common Future (1987)

The Board of Delfi Limited (“Delfi”) is pleased to present our 

fifth annual Sustainability Report which provides insight into 

our ongoing commitment to sustainability.

At Delfi, we firmly support the United Nations’ view that 

sustainable development is:

‘‘DEVELOPMENT THAT MEETS 

THE NEEDS OF THE PRESENT 

WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE 

ABILITY OF FUTURE GENERATIONS 

TO MEET THEIR OWN NEEDS1’‘

At Delfi, we call this “Sustainable Value Creation”. Delfi 

considers this to be a core part of our long-term strategy 

and has worked closely with Management to determine our 

“Four Sustainable Value Creation Pillars”.

Our Four Sustainable Value Creation Pillars encompass 

social, environmental, economic and governance themes. 

The Delfi Board, through its Market Sustainability and Strategy 

Committee (“MSSC”), plays a crucial role in overseeing the 

Company’s work in all Pillars.

Through these Pillars, we believe that we are able to address 

the needs of our various stakeholders: Our employees. Our 

community. Our customers. Our consumers. Our investors.

Akin to the cocoa tree, sustainable growth can be achieved 

when both our internal and external environments offer 

optimal conditions for us to thrive. As we flourish, our impact 

on our stakeholders widens as well. Our challenge therefore 

is to consistently share the fruits of our labour through value 

creation.

In creating value for these stakeholders today, Delfi believes 

that we are acting responsibly for the needs and aspirations 

of future generations of stakeholders. Delfi has been 

creating value for over 70 years by creating jobs and profits, 

producing enjoyable products, and paying taxes – all the 

while doing it in a way that respects the communities and 

environment in which we operate.

This year’s Sustainability Report includes a section on the 

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”).

Delfi also recognises the importance of taking necessary 

steps to combat global climate change. We support the 

shift towards a climate-friendly economy and seize every 

opportunity to drive climate resilience across our value 

chain, now and into the future. In FY2021, we implemented 

a flash steam recovery system in our Indonesia facility which 

enabled heat energy to be recovered and reused in our 

manufacturing processes. More information on the steps we 

take to manage our carbon footprint can be found in the 

Energy Management section of this Report on pages 21 to 

22.

Our Sustainability Report complements our Annual Report. 

It focuses on the environmental, social and governance 

(“ESG”) aspects of our performance in accordance with the 

Singapore Exchange Limited (“SGX”) Listing Rules 711A and 

711B for Sustainability Reporting. This report enables us to 

provide transparency to our business in the context of our 

sustainability efforts, our performance and the opportunities 

and challenges we face ahead.

grow. These Pillars frame our approach to sustainability.

Within each Pillar, we identify our stakeholders, and the 

related material sustainability matters that concern them. 

From this, we determine our goals and the initiatives 

necessary to achieve them.

During the year, we have reviewed each of these Pillars and 

updated our goals and initiatives where needed.

which were introduced in the 1950’s and “Delfi” in the 1980’s. In the Philippines, our flagship 

brands are “Goya” and “KnickKnacks”, which were introduced in the 1950’s and the 1980’s 

respectively. With our longstanding presence and legacy in these markets, our chocolates 

have delighted many generations of Indonesians and Filipinos. We hold an exclusive trademark 

rights licence to the “Van Houten” brand name for consumer chocolate products for markets 

in Asia, excluding India, Korea and the Middle East.

INTRODUCTION


LIVING WITH COVID-19 

The COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID-19”) has been a defining global health crisis over the last two years, creating social and 

economic challenges worldwide. Delfi has taken proactive steps to reduce the impact of the pandemic on our business and our 

stakeholders. In particular, our priorities are to protect our employees’ well-being and implementing business continuity plans 

to ensure that our operations are carried out safely and smoothly. 

Key highlights of our COVID-19 response for our key stakeholder groups are summarised below.

THE DELFI MINDSET AND STRONG MANAGEMENT SUPPORT

Delfi has consistently maintained our preparedness for contingencies and “Black Swan” events that could potentially threaten 

our business, by annually updating and ‘mock testing’ our Group’s Business Continuity Plan (“BCP”). Since the start of the 

pandemic, we have acted swiftly to protect our staff and our business ahead of local government prompting. Our tenacious 

mindset in the fight against COVID-19 has been critical. Throughout 2021, we have consistently monitored and adapted to 

our safe management measures, so that we can transition to a “new normal” of living with COVID-19. Our GEMC continues to 

provide regular guidance to our respective Country Emergency Management Committees (“CEMCs”) and receives feedback 

from our CEMCs on their COVID-19 measures.

GROUP EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE (“GEMC”)

The GEMC oversees our response to any emergency risk. It:

• 

ensures a holistic assessment of emergency risks as it includes senior representatives from our business, operations and management

• 

oversees all relevant policies 

• 

ensures our corporate assets are adequately protected for business continuity 

• 

guides the Country Emergency Management Committees (“CEMCs”) to implement relevant strategies within their respective countries.

CONSUMERS

Extensive measures were 

implemented across 

our entire supply chain 

to minimise operational 

disruptions and prioritise 

consumers’ health.

PARTNERS AND 

DISTRIBUTORS

Our partners and 

distributors benefit 

from their use of our 

audit standards and 

best practices to ensure 

safety and business continuity across our 

value chain.

EMPLOYEES

US$ 

600,000 

was invested in FY2021 

in staff safety equipment 

to combat the spread of COVID-19. This 

is in addition to our expenditure of US$1 

million in FY2020 for similar equipment.

COMMUNITY

Over 

24,000 

people 

including healthcare 

workers, benefitted from donations of 

our Delfi chocolate, local snacks and 

other items in FY2021. This builds on 

our donation efforts in FY2020 where 

we distributed similar items to 18,000 

beneficiaries.

LIVING WITH COVID-19 

STAFF WELL BEING – A TOP PRIORITY

Our top priority has always been the health and well-being 

of our staff. 

Since March 2020, our employees have worked in split 

teams. Staff who can work from home are required to do so, 

while we implement staggered working hours or customised 

schedules for staff required to work on-site as part of safe 

distancing measures. Our production staff are further 

‘compartmentalised’ so that team members are physically 

separated by installed structures such as polyvinyl chloride 

(PVC) or acrylic panels, enabling team members to operate 

as smaller independent sections, and reducing their risk of 

potential exposure. 

Travel restrictions continue to apply to our staff. Business 

travel has been much reduced, and we require staff to take 

safety precautions when travelling and observe a ‘stay-

home’ quarantine on arrival at their destination. 

In 2021, we invested heavily in safety equipment for our staff, 

spending US$600,000 in addition to US$1 million spent the 

year earlier. This equipment includes operational upgrades, 

medical 

and 

safety 

equipment, 

personal 

protection 

equipment (“PPE”), gloves, hazmat suits, thermal scanners 

and COVID self-testing kits. We also conduct systematic and 

randomised COVID-19 testing to pick up any asymptomatic 

cases early to better manage our risks. We regularly sanitise 

our premises and staff are reminded to take appropriate 

measures to maintain high levels of hygiene.

As COVID-19 vaccines became available in early 2021, 

Delfi included vaccination in our multi-pronged approach 

against COVID-19. We strongly encouraged our staff to 

get vaccinated, where medically possible. In Indonesia 

for example, we organised vaccination drives to facilitate 

vaccination en masse. As of December 2021, 100% of all our 

staff across the Delfi group are fully vaccinated. 

736 Delfi employees unfortunately contracted COVID-19 

in 2021. They were detected through our established 

protocols, immediately isolated and cared for. We ensure 

that all affected staff continued to enjoy their income and 

benefits, as they received medical attention to aid in their 

recovery and return to their normal lives. 







Delfi donated a variety of products in appreciation of 24,000 beneficiaries 

including frontline workers

LIVING WITH COVID-19 

CONTACT TRACING 

Delfi conducts rigorous contact tracing. All staff who 

have been in close contact with a suspected or confirmed 

COVID-19 positive case are immediately quarantined and 

tested for COVID-19. Staff may only come back to work only 

after their quarantine ends and after passing a COVID-19 

test. 

In addition, other Delfi employees who have been in close 

contact with quarantined staff would also be placed on a 

stay-home notice for the required period, to ensure that 

they and their teams are kept reasonably safe. 

We have also implemented protective measures at 

our premises and continue to require health and travel 

declarations for staff and visitors alike who visit our premises.

THINKING OF THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE 

At Delfi, we believe in the importance of recognising 

the people who put themselves at risk daily in the fight 

against the pandemic. In 2021, we donated a wide range 

of chocolates, confectionery, snacks, and basic medical 

supplies to over 24,000 beneficiaries (including healthcare 

workers in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Singapore). 

This included a donation of 10,000 SilverQueen chocolate 

bars to Indonesian healthcare workers and food delivery 

drivers for Valentine’s Day 2021 as well as 3,600 boxes of 

chocolate to Singapore healthcare workers for Christmas 

2021. 

SUPPLY OF OXYGEN CONCENTRATORS

INITIATIVE IN INDONESIA

In August 2021, as Indonesia was suffering from a shortage 

of oxygen concentrators at the height of COVID-19 wave 

of infections, Delfi also purchased over US$7,000 worth of 

oxygen concentrators and donated these concentrators to 

4 local hospitals in Indonesia. 

As the world transits to a new normal in the wake of the 

COVID-19 pandemic, Delfi hopes that our proactive efforts 

will ensure minimal impact on our business operations while 

ensuring the continued well-being of all our stakeholders. 

We will continue to provide support to the people and 

communities within our sphere of influence, to drive positive 

change and create new opportunities in the long term.







Delfi donated a variety of products in appreciation of 24,000 beneficiaries 

including frontline workers

Sound human resource practices are critical to our 

organisation as it is important that our staff are treated fairly. 

This allows Delfi to attract and retain the right talent to foster 

growth, creativity and value creation. We understand that 

having the right individuals in the right positions can have a 

profound positive impact on the Group’s performance. We

New Hires and Turnover1

&lt;401-1&gt;#

There was sufficient manpower to meet our core operational 

needs during the year. However, to meet anticipated surges 

in demand during yearly festive periods such as Ramadan 

and Christmas, temporary workers are recruited which often 

include rehiring those familiar with our operations and those 

with a preference for such short-term contracts, thereby 

accounting for the overall turnover rate and correspondingly, 

new hire rate of 80%. Our permanent staff turnover rate was 

at about 14.3% for 2021.

Employee grievance mechanisms

At Delfi, we believe that any grievances raised should be 

handled in a supportive environment, and employees are 

encouraged to raise their concerns without fear of reprisal. 

Employees can do so through their Heads of Departments 

(escalated accordingly to HR and the Executive Directors as 

necessary) or union-management channels (union directly 

reports to HR or through bipartite meetings between 

Representative Management and Union every month). We 

seek to investigate and resolve all confirmed cases as soon as 

practicable and carry out counselling and dialogue sessions 

to ensure all issues are addressed amicably. All grievance 

proceedings and records will be kept in confidence.

Employee benefits

&lt;401-2&gt;#

Delfi cares about its people. Beyond rewarding employees 

with remuneration that is commensurate with the efforts 

and performance delivered in helping the business achieve 

its goals, Delfi is invested in the well-being and morale of 

our employees. In our belief that happy employees will in 

turn raise productivity and efficiency, Delfi offers a range of 

employment benefits tailored for our full-time employees. 

Apart from the provision of baseline benefits mandated by 

local labour regulations, the HR team works closely with the 

country units in reviewing the non-monetary performance-

Rates are computed as a percentage of total employee numbers by gender, as at end of financial year 2021. 

New hire rates are calculated as: Number of new hires (by gender) / Number of employees as at end of financial year 2021 (by gender) 

Turnover rates are calculated as: Number of employees who leave the organisation (by gender) / Number of employees as at end of financial year 2021 (by gender)

Total Turnover Rate was driven largely by temporary short-term contract workers and part-time workers, who prefer not to be bound by long-term or permanent contracts.

FLOOD RELIEF FOR DELFI EMPLOYEES IN MALAYSIA 

After days of heavy rain in December 2021, some areas in the state of Selangor was hit 

by catastrophic floods, leading to the destruction of homes, roads, and infrastructures. 

In the face of calamity, Delfi quickly provided flood relief assistance to our Malaysian 

employees who were severely affected by the floods. Our employees were given 

additional leave days and compassionate financial assistance which aimed to alleviate 

their recovery process. 

Protecting the safety and well-being of our employees remain our top priorities at Delfi, 

and we remain committed to act quickly and support our employees in the event of 

natural disasters and emergencies.

based rewards and programs offered. Our benefits package 

may include life insurance, medical care benefits, disability 

coverage, parental leave and retirement provisions. We only 

partner with globally-recognised and reputable third party 

medical and financial organisations, with the aim to provide 

quality healthcare services and a holistic coverage for our 

employees.

Advancing workforce diversity and inclusion

Delfi acknowledges the importance in establishing a work 

environment that respects and nurtures employees who 

come from a range of backgrounds. At Delfi, we promote 

a culture of inclusion where everyone is valued for their 

uniqueness and individuality, and employees are allowed 

to share their ideas, thus fostering a sense of belonging. 

For instance, as a testament to equitable and fair gender 

representation in Delfi, our permanent workforce had a ratio 

of 45:55 men to women in 2021. Embedding the principles 

of diversity and inclusion at the workplace is a source of 

competitive advantage for Delfi and helps to strengthen 

innovation in the way we conduct business.

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT

&lt;103-1&gt;#

At Delfi, a culture of safety is deeply rooted in our 

organisation and everything we do. As such, we place great 

emphasis on Occupational Health and Safety (“OHS”). We 

are fully aware that in our workplace, we are responsible 

for the health and safety of our employees. We review our 

practices on a regular basis to avoid workplace incidents 

and ensure the overall safety of our people. This includes 

proper training and identification of workplace hazards to 

ensure our employees acquire the necessary knowledge for 

the safe and hygienic performance of their duties. Another 

key mitigating measure is to provide our employees with 

appropriate protective measures, and enforce their use, 

to minimise risk of accidents and reduce their possible 

consequences.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH 

&lt;103-2&gt; &lt;103-3&gt; &lt;403-1&gt;#

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

POLICY

Our workforce is the heart of our operations; 

their health and safety are of utmost 

importance. We meet and strive to exceed 

the relevant occupational health and safety 

standards. Our internal OHS policy, which covers all 

employees, aims to eliminate workplace hazards and 

prevent occupational illnesses in compliance with the 

applicable laws and other requirements.

 

Employees in our Indonesia factory site are also covered 

by an International Organisation for Standardisation (“ISO”) 

45001:2018 certified OHS Management System which 

is internally audited biannually, and externally audited 

annually. We adhere to the requirements prescribed by 

the Philippines government through the Department 

of Labour and Employment and plan to go beyond to 

attain Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series 

(“OHSAS”) certification where practicable.

COMMITMENTS &amp; TARGETS

We are committed to offering a healthy 

working environment to our workforce. 

We aim for zero work-related fatalities 

and to continuously improve our safety 

performance across all our operations. We seek to be fully 

compliant with all relevant laws. 

We have the following target:

Hazard Identification, Prevention and

Incident Investigation

&lt;403-2&gt; &lt;403-9&gt;#

 

Delfi conducts regular safety risk assessment checks at its 

Indonesia and Philippines manufacturing facilities to identify 

and record any work-related hazards. Some potential work-

related hazards that we have identified in our operations 

include working from heights, in confined environments or 

areas with high electricity current, and using older machines 

with fewer safety devices. After identification of these risks, 

Delfi undertakes the actions necessary to eliminate them 

based on the hierarchy of controls, prioritising hazards with 

higher severity and likelihood. For instance, proactive control 

measures for employees working from heights include the 

use of standard scaffolding, ensuring workers’ adherence to 

safety signs, and enforcing use of safety body harnesses.

In our ongoing pursuit to achieve an accident-free 

workplace, we commit ourselves to internal and external 

audits that enables us to identify areas for improvement. 

Where practicable, we implement new technologies to 

replace manual processes to improve safety. For example, 

we are currently replacing manual transfers using forklifts 

with a pumping system in our Indonesia facility to reduce 

occupational hazards.

As an employer, Delfi recognises that a safe work environment 

increases our people’s mental and physical well-being. We 

constantly encourage our people to flag unsafe working 

conditions across our operations. An example is our “Near 

Miss” system that encourages all employees to report near 

miss incidents they encounter and any safety suggestions. 

All employees must follow strict procedures when operating 

specific machines to safeguard them and their co-workers 

from any unexpected issues that may arise.

At Delfi, we regard all incidents that occur as important. 

Documentation of the incident is detailed in a corrective 

action report post-investigation and subject to further 

review and approval by a safety and health coordinator. 

Subsequent follow-ups are conducted to ensure that 

preventive measures are implemented, such as activity-

based audits, enhancement of Lock-out/Tag-out (“LOTO”) 

procedures and risk assessment training.

Access to Health Services

&lt;403-3&gt; &lt;403-6&gt;#

Delfi safeguards the physical and mental health of our 

employees by ensuring that both occupational and non-

occupational health services are readily accessible. All 

employees are also covered under our group hospital and 

medical insurance plans, and undergo an annual medical 

check-up provided by certified healthcare practitioners. 

Regular announcements are made to remind and update 

employees of their health benefits. Transport to medical 

facilities is arranged readily where necessary. Our Philippines 

manufacturing facility also has an internal clinic manned 

24/7 by qualified nurses during work-week operations to 

serve the needs of our employees.

Stakeholder participation, consultation,

and communication

&lt;403-4&gt; &lt;403-5&gt; &lt;403-7&gt;#

All employees, including workers, supervisors and managers, 

are involved in risk analysis processes. The Safety Committee, 

comprising of observers from both management and 

workers, 

meets 

monthly 

to 

monitor 

recent 

safety 

performances, discuss any recent incidents and implement 

any actions to prevent future occurrences.

An initiative – “Safety Wednesday” has been launched to 

encourage staff collaboration to improve work processes 

to build a safer work environment for all. Employees are 

awarded points for exemplary safety behaviour.

Comprehensive training programmes are conducted for all 

employees annually, in several languages including Bahasa 

Indonesia and Tagalog, to facilitate better awareness of our 

safety culture across all sites. For operations with higher 

safety risks, employees are required to undergo technical 

safety awareness trainings and pass qualifying exams 

before deployment. Training needs are analysed and the 

effectiveness of these trainings are also reviewed.

Recognising our responsibility to mitigate any negative OHS 

impacts, we conscientiously work with our business partners 

and suppliers to conduct mandatory inspections of their 

packing facility and processes before we engage them. More 

information on our responsible supply chain management 

measures can be found in the ‘Supply Chain Assessment’ 

section of this report.

In FY2021, our non-employees worked a total of 445,382 

hours. There was one recordable injury in our non-

employees which resulted in 1 lost workday.

There were no serious work-related injuries in FY2021 for 

our employees and non-employees.

In FY2021, our manufacturing processes and output were 

significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite 

this, we continue to focus on the health and well-being 

of all our employees in the workplace and minimising the 

impact on the business. This year, there was a slight increase 

in lost day and absentee rates as working hours reduced due 

to the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on production 

capacity and precautions taken to reduce physical contact 

at our facilities. We will continue to assess the safety aspects 

of our facilities and stay proactive in the implementation of 

initiatives to drive workplace safety results.

Consumers today call for greater transparency in disclosure 

of raw material origins, employee welfare and food 

safety programs. Fuelled by these increasing stakeholder 

expectations, government regulations and innovation, Delfi 

continues to sharpen its focus on consumer health and 

safety as a key sustainability matter.

As an established chocolate confectionery company, Delfi 

strongly believes in our social responsibility to promote 

mindful consumption of our products – especially in our 

younger consumers. We continually allocate resources in 

food science research and product innovation to design a 

wider range of healthier treats for the world to enjoy. 

In our commitment to provide healthier products for our 

customers, we are working to gradually switch to the use of 

natural food colouring, as well as the production of products 

with less sugar while also making sure that the taste profile 

of our chocolate confectionery remains appealing to our 

loyal consumers.

Delfi continues to explore incorporating healthy ingredients 

such as grains and real fruits, and fortifying our products 

with additional vitamins and minerals, to provide added 

nutritional benefits for our consumers. We also continue 

to develop new product concepts each year based on our 

understanding of consumer demand. This year, we have 

started exploring the incorporation of more plant-based 

ingredients, such as fruits, oats, nuts, and plant-based milk 

to accommodate our consumers’ growing interest in vegan 

products. We are also pleased to share the launch of our 

new range of “Van Houten Dark Milk Chocolate” which has 

higher cocoa content and less sugar.

Our Food Safety Management System

As part of our overall Food Safety Management System, 

we have made significant investments in quality assurance 

systems to achieve high manufacturing standards. These 

include:

Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”)

GMP was established by the Food and Drug Administration 

in the USA in 1967. These guidelines provide minimum 

requirements that a food product manufacturer must meet 

to ensure that their products are of high quality and do not 

pose any risk to the consumer. Our GMP is audited on a 

monthly basis.

Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (“HACCP”)

HACCP is a comprehensive food safety program for our 

production process. Assessments are made of the applicable 

risks (e.g. microbiological, chemical, physical, food safety 

and quality standard). Based on such assessments, the critical 

control points are determined within the production process 

to control identified hazards. Procedures for monitoring and 

taking corrective actions are established for each control 

point. Therefore, any problem is traceable to a specific point 

in the production process and/or the specific raw material 

utilised.

We conduct process testing to ensure our products are of 

high quality. This includes testing product samples for quality 

defects and for compliance to our strict microbiological 

content specifications to ensure that our products are 

always safe for human consumption.

Each delivery of products is given a unique lot identification 

code printed on its packing and accompanying documents 

which incorporates the date of manufacture. This information 

can be used to trace the complete production history of 

the product starting from the source of raw materials. 

Any delivery breaching our quality standards can thus be 

identified and stopped before the products are delivered to 

our customers. HACCP reviews are conducted annually to 

ensure effectiveness of this management system.

FSSC 22000 Food Safety System Certification

FSSC 22000 provides a framework for effectively managing 

the Group’s food safety responsibilities. FSSC 22000 is fully 

recognised by the Global Food Safety Initiatives (“GFSI”) and 

is based on existing ISO Standards. While our manufacturing 

facility in the Philippines follows version 5 certification, we 

have additionally upgraded the FSSC 22000 certification to 

version 5.1 in our Indonesia facility.

High hygiene standards

Delfi observes high hygiene standards. We practice proper 

segregation of production areas in the factory based on 

differing hygiene requirements with our operations and 

restrictions necessary to protect products from potential 

contamination. Regular training and checks are conducted 

on our personnel at our facilities. These includes stringent 

requirements on attire, footwear and personal hygiene. 

During the onset of COVID-19, we replaced body checks 

for employees, visitors and contractors with metal detectors 

and increased checks on personal belongings.

Innovation and technology

We draw on innovation and technology to improve our 

food safety standards. For example, we tap on the use of 

surveillance in our production facilities and continue to 

improve upon our controlled and locked access systems to 

enhance food security.

Labelling and communication

The provision of information on our products is important 

to our consumers as well as being the subject of many 

regulations. To that end, we strive to provide transparent 

access to reliable and accurate information on our products 

through responsible labelling. Our labels include the 

product’s expiry date, recommended storage conditions, 

allergen declaration, ingredients and compliance to halal 

standards. We also highlight information on the nutritional 

value of our confectionary products on our product labels 

where applicable, such as use of vegan-friendly ingredients, 

natural colours and flavours, or additional cocoa mass. We 

continuously seek to improve the contents of our product 

labels with greater emphasis on the sustainability impact of 

our products.

Customer care portal

We value feedback from our customers. We ensure that 

all customers and consumers can be heard through our 

customer care portal. All our products manufactured in 

Indonesia and the Philippines bear the address of the 

relevant portal (http://www.delfilimited.com/custcare/ and/

or https://www.vanhoutenchocolates.com/custcare/). This 

provides a direct avenue for all customers to reach out to 

Delfi and is also a central system for the business to maintain 

an overview of the quality of the products, service delivery 

and feedback received.

Delfi adopts a unified Consumer Customer Care Procedure 

that standardises our approach in addressing all customer 

health and safety related grievances across all business units 

and ensures that each complaint is addressed promptly. We 

adopt a continuous improvement methodology to manage 

all feedback received and use it to inform our business 

decisions and improve on our processes.

Product Storage

Our prescribed standards and best practices for storage in 

our value chain ensure that our products are safe and fit 

for human consumption, as well as fresh enough for our 

customers to enjoy our products.

In 2021, we have met our target of no incidents of material 

non-compliance with applicable laws for consumer health 

and safety as well as for product information and labelling.

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT

&lt;103-1&gt;#

As a responsible steward of the environment, Delfi recognises 

that optimising our energy use can reduce greenhouse gas 

emissions, and our actions can play a part in combating 

wider environmental issues such as climate change and air 

pollution. Bearing in mind the COP 26 held in late 2021, as 

well as the global commitments countries have taken to 

accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement 

and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, 

Delfi has an important role to play as an organisation to cut 

its own carbon emissions. We support the shift towards a 

climate-friendly economy and support climate resilience 

across our value chain.

In line with this view, recognising that energy is necessary for 

our production processes, efficient energy usage remains 

key in our planning and operations, and we will continue to 

keep a close eye on our energy usage to ensure we do not 

use more than we need, we reduce variable consumption 

where practicable and we explore the use of energy efficient 

systems.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH 

&lt;103-2&gt; &lt;103-3&gt;#

POLICY

Delfi understands the importance of saving 

energy to the company and the environment 

and we are focused on using our energy 

sources efficiently. We have in place internal 

energy management policies related to energy reduction 

that seek to fully comply with the relevant laws. As a 

testament to our commitment, we have further obtained 

ISO14001:2015 certification over the environmental 

management system at our Indonesia facility to ensure 

proper governance of environmental matters. This is 

internally audited every six months and externally audited 

on an annual basis.

COMMITMENTS &amp; TARGETS

Delfi is committed to managing our carbon 

footprint by investing in energy efficient 

technologies and making the shift to 

cleaner fuels across our operations. 

In addition, we have the following targets:

Scope

Current Targets

&lt;103-3&gt; &lt;302-1&gt; &lt;302-3&gt;#

At Delfi, we believe we can be an environmentally-conscious 

contributor towards a more sustainable food system. We 

constantly monitor our energy consumption to ensure that 

our energy usage is optimised. We have appointed certified 

energy managers with the relevant expertise to oversee 

environmental matters at our manufacturing facilities in 

Indonesia.

Sources of energy consumption at Delfi come mainly from 

fuel in our manufacturing facilities in Indonesia and the 

Philippines, specifically electricity usage, liquified petroleum 

gas (“LPG”), bunker fuel oil (“BFO”) (Philippines only) 

and natural gas (Indonesia only). While BFO was already 

previously eliminated in our Indonesian facility, we are 

pleased to announce that we have completely eliminated 

the use of BFO by replacing with a cleaner source of fuel, 

LPG, at our manufacturing facility in the Philippines, as LPG 

is a lower-carbon alternative.

During the year, several retrofits were carried out in our 

commitment to reduce our energy consumption levels. 

They include replacement of fluorescent lamps with LED 

lamps, installation of electricity monitoring devices, repair 

of air compressor leakages and optimisation of compressed 

natural gas (“CNG”) consumption. In Indonesia, Delfi 

consulted industry experts in implementing an energy-

saving system at our manufacturing facility and optimising 

the consumption of fuel in our production facilities. 

Monitoring systems are also in place to keep track of each 

machine’s energy consumption levels, and we ensure that 

any leakage detected in our air compressors is fixed as soon 

as possible. Delfi Indonesian employees also attended an 

ISO 50001 seminar as well as an ISO 50006 Energy Base Line 

and Energy Performance Indicator training session to build 

up their knowledge of energy management systems. Energy 

consumed by us at the facility was reduced as a result.

In 2021, our total internal energy consumption, including 

both fuel and electricity usage, amounted to 87,995 mWh, 

a fall of 2.49% from the 90,246 mWh consumed in 2020. 

Our conservation efforts and established control procedures 

to limit unnecessary energy usage have contributed to the 

fall in energy consumption across both our manufacturing 

facilities.

*On a per metric ton basis, the total amount of energy 

consumed for 2021 was 2.98 mWh/MT, which was an increase 

of 6% from 2020. This increase was mainly due to an increase 

of energy consumption driven by additional COVID-19 

safety protocols, resulting in inevitable inefficiencies in our 

operations. Delfi has already implemented several initiatives 

to mitigate the long-term impacts of COVID-19 (see “Living 

with COVID-19”), and moving forward, Delfi will continue to 

invest in efforts to reduce our fixed energy consumption1.

Fixed energy consumption refers to consumption that occurs regardless of production output levels.

ENERGY MANAGEMENT 

FLASH STEAM RECOVERY PROJECT IN INDONESIA 

In FY2021, we implemented a flash steam recovery system in our Indonesia facility which enabled 

heat energy to be recovered and reused in our manufacturing processes. A flash steam recovery 

system releases steam generated during our production processes into a vessel rather than 

directly into the atmosphere. This enables the recovery of heat energy to be reused in our hot 

water generators, providing the energy input for jacketed heating that is also required in our 

manufacturing process.

PRACTICES AND PERFORMANCE 

&lt;103-3&gt; &lt;303-3&gt;#

We seek to ensure that our operations use water1 responsibly 

and efficiently. We rely on locally-sourced groundwater (as 

well as the municipal water supply in the Philippines) for 

our needs, drawing water within the permissible daily limits 

granted by the relevant governing agencies. We continue 

to manage our water usage consciously and ensure that 

we do not use more than we need. When there is a surplus 

in our water storage, we would also share this with our 

neighbouring local community.

In 2021, the overall volume of water used amounted to 

128,305 m3 in Indonesia and the Philippines, which was a 

27% reduction from the 174,960 m3 consumed in 2020. Our 

Indonesia facility withdrew 115,869 m3 from groundwater 

amounting to 90% of the total water used, while the 

remaining 10% is attributed to our facility in the Philippines, 

with 298 m3 from municipal water supply and 12,138 m3 

from groundwater. This achievement was largely due to 

conservation efforts to limit unnecessary water use during 

production at our facilities. More notably, our commitment 

to increase the use of treated water that has undergone 

processing by our wastewater treatment plant at our 

facilities continues to play a significant part in reducing our 

consumption from external sources.

*On a per metric ton basis, the total volume of water used 

for 2021 was 4.35m3/MT, which was a decrease of 21% 

from 2020. This decrease can be attributed in part to our 

continued efforts to reduce water usage where practicable 

and also adopt the use of reclaiming water for non-potable 

activities such as comfort rooms, gardening, cooling towers 

and boilers. Delfi continues to implement several initiatives 

to mitigate the long-term impacts of COVID-19 (see “Living 

with COVID-19”), and moving forward, Delfi will continue to 

invest in efforts to reduce our water usage and safeguard this 

precious resource.

CONTRIBUTION OF CLEAN WATER SUPPLY TO THE COMMUNITY

Beyond our customers, consumers, and business partners, Delfi recognises the importance 

of enriching lives and building sustainable relationships with the communities in which we 

operate.

One of our key contributions is the supply of clean water (estimated at 70m3 per day) to the 

community living close to the factory in Indonesia. Water that is supplied to the surrounding 

communities undergoes treatment and meets the clean water standards of Indonesia - 

Permenkes No. 492/MENKES/PER/IV/2010. This ensures that water received by the local 

communities is drinkable and their basic welfare and needs are met.

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT

&lt;103-1&gt;#

Waste and effluents management is critical for human health 

and the environment. For our communities to prosper and 

enjoy a high quality of life, we have to conscientiously 

monitor our discharge into the environment and seek to 

eliminate or reduce any ecological impact. It is thus vital to 

prioritise waste disposal methods that minimise any potential 

impacts, such as reusing, recycling and recovery. Treatment 

of our effluents is also crucial in ensuring that hazardous 

substances do not leach into ecosystems and undergo bio-

amplification along the food chain. Managing waste also 

brings about potential cost-savings to our organisation. 

Looking into resource efficiency in our production will 

enable us to create more with less and deliver greater value 

to our stakeholders.

&lt;103-3&gt;

Effluents

&lt;303-2&gt; &lt;303-4&gt;#

We closely monitor our water discharge in both our 

manufacturing facilities in Indonesia and the Philippines. 

The wastewaters from our facilities are biologically treated 

and tested before being discharged into the city sewers or 

nearby rivers as freshwater. We utilise wastewater quality 

indicators to measure and ensure that wastewater quality 

is in a generally acceptable range1 before discharge into 

the natural environment. In Indonesia, our manufacturing 

plant is ISO14001 certified, and has been assigned a 

“Blue” (Adequate) rating under the PROPER scheme 

which promotes compliance with existing water pollution 

regulations. We are in progress towards achieving a “Green” 

(Good) rating by improving our environmental management 

procedures beyond the expected compliance level.

Delfi also implemented a Zero Processed Water Discharge 

project which aims to ensure that 100% of the processed 

wastewater produced by our Indonesia and Philippines 

facilities are treated and repurposed for use in toilets 

or gardening purposes. As a result, Delfi has reduced 

approximately 40,000 m3 of freshwater consumption in our 

manufacturing facilities in FY2021 compared to FY2020.

In 2021, a total volume of 41,691 m3 water was discharged 

in Indonesia and the Philippines. Our Indonesia facility 

discharged 3,004 m3 into a treatment facility and 28,487 m3 

into nearby rivers. Our facility at the Philippines discharged 

210,200 m3 into the city sewers; majority of the water 

produced here is recycled in treatment facilities and recycled 

under the Zero Processed Water Discharge project to be 

repurposed. The volume of water discharged in 2021 fell by 

29% from 59,029 m3 in 2020.

*On a per metric ton basis, the total volume of water 

discharged for 2021 was 1.41 m3/MT, which was a decrease 

of 24% from prior year. This decrease can be attributed to 

our efforts to reduce our water usage in Delfi as well as 

from our various water-saving initiatives including the Zero 

Processed Water Discharged project.

Resource management in Delfi

&lt;306-1&gt; &lt;306-2&gt;#

At Delfi, we ensure that our waste is safely disposed of to ensure that we do not contaminate 

our environment.

Key activities that produce waste in Delfi include manufacturing activities from procurement 

of raw materials to production and packaging for distribution, as well as overall governance, 

maintenance, and facility activities. By assessing the resources used at each stage of our value 

chain, Delfi was able to seize opportunities to transform waste into valued resources, thereby 

reducing waste directed to landfill and minimizing environmental impacts of our operations.

The following chart summarises key waste streams generated from our operations. We 

strive to implement closed-loop strategies in our organisation to minimise waste disposal 

and contribute towards a circular economy ideal, such as composting our absorber sludge 

waste or transforming scrap products into animal feed. Where possible, we also take steps to 

eliminate unnecessary waste, such as implementing electronic approval systems and referring 

to e-documents in place of printing physical copies in our offices.

In 2021, the volume of overall waste amounted to 1,257,568 

kg in our Indonesia and the Philippines facilities, an increase 

of 19% from 1,058,748 kg in 2020. This increase in waste 

generated was due to greater recycling of our processed 

water which resulted in additional waste by-product. This 

waste by-product is biodegradable and is composed of 40% 

water and 60% nutrients. We donate this waste by-product 

to local farmers for use as fertilizers. Going forward, one of 

our key objectives for 2022 is to reduce the total amount of 

waste by-product produced. 

*On a per metric ton basis, the volume of overall waste 

for 2021 was 42.6 kg/MT, which was a 28% increase from 

the prior year. This increase was mainly due to a fall in 

production output across our manufacturing facilities due to 

the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 this year. Delfi has 

already implemented several initiatives to mitigate the long-

term impact of COVID-19 (see “Living with COVID-19”).

Non-hazardous waste consisted of packaging, production 

peripherals comprising of paper, plastic and metallic 

materials, and residual waste sludge, produced as a by-

product of the wastewater treatment process. Hazardous 

waste relates to waste from our analytical laboratory 

(e.g. laboratory chemicals), maintenance activities (e.g. 

transformer oil), as well as biohazardous waste Such waste is 

stored securely before being disposed of in compliance with 

all regulatory requirements.

In respect of our overall non-hazardous waste produced, 

which made up 98.9% of our total waste, 90.2% was 

recycled, 2.6% was accounted for through recovery, 1.8% 

was reused, 3.4% was directed to landfill and the remaining 

1.9% was disposed by contractors in compliance with 

local regulations. Our hazardous waste, which amounted 

to 1.1% of our total waste, was managed and disposed of 

in compliance with local regulations by authorised waste 

contractors.

and directed to disposal in Delfi in 2021:

At Delfi, we understand that agricultural practices can 

potentially bring about adverse environmental impacts. It is 

therefore a key objective for our sourcing function that all 

the agricultural products used are derived sustainably and 

purchased responsibly along our direct supply chain. Delfi 

practices due diligence in our operations in ensuring minimal 

adverse environmental impacts, such as engaging with 

partners who believe in the same sustainability agenda as we 

do, and continuously improving our sourcing approach to 

advance our sustainability vision.

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT

&lt;103-1&gt;#

Delfi is a responsible organisation – through our value 

creation chain, our materials and products move across 

international borders daily. Any failures in compliance with 

import, export and trade regulations would directly impact 

our organisation and may lead to socioeconomic, civil, or 

even criminal penalties. Non-compliance could also cause 

significant business disruption such as loss of business 

opportunities, custom clearance and shipment delays, or 

government sequestration. Such disruptions would ripple 

across our organisation – affecting our production and 

delivery schedules, greatly impacting our stakeholders along 

the value chain and our brand reputation. On a financial level, 

these costs collectively would have a significant bearing on 

our financial bottom line.

PRACTICES AND PERFORMANCE

&lt;103-3&gt;#

Our cross-functional teams support one another in ensuring 

that our approach towards being fully compliant remains 

robust. We conduct regular internal meetings to update each 

other on any changes to the relevant laws and regulations 

at the local, national and international level. These laws 

and regulations are complex, dynamic and require close 

monitoring.

We work closely with Badan Pengawas Obat dan Makanan 

(”BPOM”) Republik Indonesia and participate in BPOM’s 

focus group discussions for the formulation of regulations. 

This has strengthened our channels of communication with 

BPOM, providing us an official platform to directly engage 

and build on good sector practices shared in enhancing our 

compliance track record for food safety and quality.

In 2021, there were zero material incidents of non-

compliance with applicable import, export, and trade 

regulations.

OUR VALUES

&lt;102-16&gt;#

Integrity, excellence, and commitment are values that guide 

all of us at Delfi as we seek to enhance our organisation’s 

development, performance, and growth. These core values 

are embedded within our concept of corporate governance 

and form an integral part of our culture.

GOVERNANCE

CODE OF CONDUCT

&lt;102-17&gt;#

Our Code of Conduct provides a framework for ethical 

decision making and good conduct for the Group. The 

Code contains important core values and principles of the 

Company’s professional conduct and governance. The 

Board of Directors, Management and all employees are 

dedicated to upholding the Code. 

Delfi has an Ethics Code, within our Code of Conduct, to 

which advice on matters of ethical concerns and grievances 

may be sought by our internal and external stakeholders. 

These matters will be handled objectively and subject to 

further investigation, disciplinary action/s or legal process, 

where justified and necessary.

In addition, Delfi has a whistle blowing policy that seeks 

to encourage reporting of matters which may comprise 

misconduct without fear of reprisal, whilst ensuring that all 

stakeholders are treated fairly.

With regard to issues relating to our ESG concerns, external 

stakeholders can also file their feedback or concerns 

through our general corporate relations channels. Internal 

stakeholders can do so through human resources or union-

management channels. We seek to investigate and resolve 

all cases as soon as practicable. All grievance proceedings 

are confidential.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

&lt;102-18&gt;#

The Board of Delfi comprises 3 executive Directors and 5 

non-executive Directors. There is a clear separation of the 

roles of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman. One 

of our 3 executive Directors serves as CEO and Managing 

Director. The Board meets regularly and is provided with 

timely updates and information. As and when there are 

urgent commercial or other corporate matters, Board 

meetings are convened to provide guidance. All Directors 

are expected to act in good faith, and to act in the 

interests of all Delfi shareholders. The Board is supported 

by the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee, the 

Remuneration Committee, the Nominating Committee, the 

Risk Management Committee and the Market Sustainability 

and Strategy Committee. These committees (with the 

exception of the Executive Committee) provide guidance 

and regularly review matters within their purview.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

Beyond our customers, consumers and business partners, Delfi recognises the importance of enriching lives and building sustainable relationships with the many communities we serve.

Milk Drinking Movement

In 2021, Delfi has successfully completed a 3-year project 

to partner with elementary schools in Bandung, Indonesia 

to bring the Milk Drinking Movement (Gerakan Minum Susu) 

to life. The students in the program are given fresh milk to 

boost their nutrition and encourage healthy growth.

The initiative is in keeping with our regulatory commitment 

with Indonesia’s Ministry of Agriculture, to help energise the 

development of the domestic fresh milk industry locally.

Our Food From the Heart Initiatives 

We regularly partner with charitable organisations to 

support people in need. Our initiatives in 2021 include our 

partnership with Charis Old Folks Home in Malaysia, to 

donate daily necessities to the elderly such as food, biscuits, 

and other essentials.

A total of US$1,940 was contributed through this donation, 

and we hope that our support alleviates some of the burden 

during these challenging times.

Delfi Limited’s Race Against Cancer 

At Delfi, we believe that no one should fight cancer alone 

and we believe in the importance of uniting as one to join 

in the fight to save lives, while simultaneously complying 

with safe distancing measures. Therefore, we participated in 

the Race Against Cancer (RAC), organised by the Singapore 

Cancer Society, to raise funds for cancer treatment 

subsidies, cancer rehabilitation, cancer screenings, research, 

public education, and cancer support group initiatives. Delfi 

employees successfully fundraised a total of US$2,560 for 

this cause. We hope that our contributions could help in the 

fight for a cancer-free community.

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT

&lt;103-1&gt;#

Securing socially and environmentally sustainable agricultural 

products is important to Delfi and our stakeholders. We 

recognise that our impact on people and the environment 

extends beyond our own business activities. These impacts 

can occur as a result of our business relationships throughout 

our supply chain. Therefore, due diligence is expected of 

Delfi in taking concrete steps to prevent and mitigate all 

forms of adverse social and environmental impacts that are 

directly linked to our operations and products. To that end, 

we seek to drive the sustainability agenda along our supply 

chain and collaborate with like-minded business partners to 

mutually advance our shared sustainability vision.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH 

&lt;103-2&gt;&lt;103-3&gt;#

SUPPLY CHAIN ASSESSMENT

POLICY

Our emphasis is to work with suppliers who 

support sustainable practices. Sustainability is 

a core criterion in our supplier evaluation, and 

we are continuously improving our sourcing 

approach to drive the sustainability agenda. 

Our Standards comprise our minimum ESG requirements 

expected from our suppliers. Our approach is based on 

international laws, regulations and the core conventions 

as defined in the fundamental principles of Human Rights 

at work, namely:

 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UN, 1948)

 Convention on the Rights of the Child (UN, 1989)

 ILO Declaration (ILO, 1998)

 The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development 

(UN, 1992)

 The Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact 

Framework (UN, 2000)

 The Johannesburg UN World Summit on Sustainable 

Development (UN, 2002)

Delfi Indonesia has a sustainable sourcing strategy for 

the acquisition of raw materials that is aligned with the 

Rainforest Alliance certification requirements.

Delfi Limited’s Prescribed Standards

We urge all our partners and suppliers to uphold our 

Prescribed Standards, Requirements and Practices for the 

Environment, Social and Working Conditions (“Standards”).

We recognise that our business has an impact on people 

and the environment. We believe that we are empowered 

to choose to act responsibly, with integrity and to do good 

while fulfilling our intent of being a good business partner. 

Upholding this principle is a pre-condition to our future 

growth; a growth that will be achieved along with other like-

minded responsible business partners and suppliers who 

share and identify with our vision, mission and approach to 

doing business.

As a result, Delfi requires business partners and suppliers 

to acknowledge and agree to our Standards, for the 

management of businesses, the purchase of materials and 

the delivery of services. Ultimately, it is the spirit of our 

Standards that is important to us, and it is with this spirit that 

we consistently urge our business partners to stand shoulder 

to shoulder with us in upholding our Standards. Likewise, 

in our bid to uphold ethical business practices and supply 

chain transparency, our Indonesia facility undergoes yearly 

SMETA audit, an ethical audit format which reports on the 

Sedex pillars of Labour, Health and Safety, Environment and 

Business Ethics. Delfi is a member of Sedex – one of the 

world’s leading ethical trade membership organisations.

In 2021, in response to the COVID-19 crisis, Delfi remained 

alert to the potential adverse impact to the supply chain. 

As such, Delfi continued its practices and procedures to 

ensure efficient stock and raw materials management and 

control, keeping a watchful eye on key ingredients, and 

where appropriate or necessary nurturing or keeping ‘back-

up’ supplies and suppliers who would be able to meet our 

needs.

In particular, our Manufacturing &amp; QA team ensured that 

our supply chain remained secure by conducting external 

virtual COVID-19 audits to assist suppliers in implementing 

a checklist for COVID-19 protocol. Each supplier was 

rated based on the safety requirements each supplier has 

integrated into their processes, and action plans were 

designed based on any identified discrepancy. A total of 316 

audits were performed in 2021 on distribution centres, raw 

&amp; packaging suppliers and wholesalers across Indonesia, 

Malaysia, and the Philippines.

There was no material negative or adverse impact on our 

supply chain in 2021 as a result of COVID-19.

SUPPLIER SELF-ASSESSMENT (“SSA”) PROGRAM

In our SSA program, we assess our existing and new potential 

suppliers using an evaluation matrix which incorporates 

social and environmental criteria to check our suppliers’ ESG 

compliance. The SSA questions are based on internationally 

recognised 

standards 

(e.g. 

ISO14001 

Environmental 

Management Systems, SEDEX membership and OHSAS), 

and local environmental conservation laws.

In 2021, 37% of our new suppliers have completed the SSA. 

100% of our existing and new suppliers in our Philippines 

manufacturing facility have completed the SSA while we 

are still in the process of assessing our existing and new 

suppliers in Indonesia using the revised SSA, in line with our 

phased approach.

RAINFOREST ALLIANCE CERTIFICATION

The Rainforest Alliance is an international non-profit 

organization that aims to protect forests, promote the 

rights of farmers and forest communities, and adapt to 

the climate crisis by making responsible business the new 

normal. Rainforest Alliance certification (formerly known as 

UTZ) is an internationally renowned certification program for 

sustainable farming of cocoa and other raw materials, and it 

affirms to consumers that products have been sourced in a 

sustainable manner.

To demonstrate our commitment to more sustainable supply 

chains, Delfi Indonesia continued to be certified by the 

Rainforest Alliance certification in 2021. This certification is 

helpful in that it is an external assurance from an independent 

non-governmental organisation that Delfi Indonesia has 

a sustainable sourcing strategy for the acquisition of raw 

materials and is able to supply Rainforest Alliance certified 

products to its customers.

SUSTAINABILITY PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES

Delfi believes in collaborating with businesses, communities, 

governments and non-governmental organisations (‘NGOs’) 

to tackle systemic sustainability concerns that may be 

prevalent in our sector. So, for example, in the chocolate 

industry, it is imperative that we do our part in helping to 

address these concerns and work against known ills such 

as child labour, forced labour, human rights violations, 

cruelty against animals, deforestation, and pollution, while 

we also focus on promoting good policies and practices in 

employment, health, safety and governance.

labour union relations and advocating 

excellence in occupational health and 

safety.

Local

Communities

We respect the communities we operate 

in, and are keen to advance the interests 

of the Company and the community in 

lockstep. 

As a good corporate citizen, we aim 

to achieve our goals through actively 

shaping and participating in community 

programs and initiatives.

Suppliers

As we view our suppliers as business 

partners, our objective is for mutual 

growth through fair and transparent 

dealings in compliance with relevant laws 

and regulations. 

We are also increasingly seeking out and 

working with suppliers that subscribe to 

our sustainability agenda. We audit our 

original product manufacturers and key 

suppliers for sustainable value creation.

Customers

At Delfi, we see distributors, wholesalers 

and retailers as our customers as well as 

our partners in expanding our reach to 

our consumers, and ultimately driving 

sales for the company. 

Our goal is to create a fair and mutually 

beneficial arrangement, through clear 

and open communication lines on 

expectations. 

Governments

&amp; Regulators

We have the utmost respect for the 

rule of law, and continually extend our 

cooperation with governments and 

regulators. 

It is our priority to ensure compliance 

with the relevant laws and regulations in 

the jurisdictions in which we do business.

Trade &amp; 

Industry 

Associations

Our goal is to play an active role in the 

trade and industry associations of which 

we are members, to help further the 

interests of the group. 

We hope to lend our support and 

contribute to the various initiatives that 

will help advance our sustainability 

agenda.

Non-profit

Organisations

We seek to constructively engage non-

profit organisations, align on common 

social causes and explore models for 

further partnership where feasible.

At Delfi, passion for people has always been at the heart of what we do. Focusing our connections with all our stakeholders is 

vital for us to constantly meet and hopefully exceed their expectations. Our conversations with our stakeholders allow us to 

understand their key concerns and respond accordingly. Our sustainable value creation approach draws upon these outcomes. 

We connect with our stakeholders through various modes of regular engagement including meetings, briefings, phone calls and 

other forms of communication.

GOALS


At Delfi, we believe that our Sustainability mission is built on the four intertwined themes of social, environmental, economic 

and governance issues which we call our “Four Sustainable Value Creation Pillars”. We take a four-step approach to identify 

and focus on the sustainability material matters within each of these Pillars as we believe them to be the most relevant to our 

business and our key stakeholders.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

&lt;102-46&gt; &lt;102-47&gt; &lt;102-49&gt;#

 Determine the process 

principles of our materiality 

assessment

 Cross-functional focus 

group discussions and 

interviews were conducted 

to consider sustainability 

from both internal and 

external stakeholders’ 

perspectives

 Based on our stakeholder 

engagement and drawing 

from insights on our 

internal and external value 

drivers, a comprehensive 

universe of 30 potential 

material sustainability 

matters was identified

 Facilitated by independent 

consultants, a materiality 

assessment workshop was 

conducted in FY2017

 In FY2018 and FY2019, we 

reviewed the materiality 

matrix to ensure continued 

relevance to our business 

and stakeholders

 In FY2020, we identified 

energy management as a 

new material matter

 The reviewed materiality 

matrix was validated by 

the Board of Directors 

for reporting in this, our 

fourth sustainability report 

validation
