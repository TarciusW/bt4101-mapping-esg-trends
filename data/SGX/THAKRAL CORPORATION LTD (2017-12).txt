In 2016, the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited 

(“SGX-ST”) introduced sustainability reporting for all SGX-listed 

companies. Sustainability reporting became effective for Thakral 

Corporation Ltd (the “Company” and together with its subsidiaries 

and associated companies, the “Group”) with effect from the 

financial year ended 31 December 2017.

The Group is pleased to present its inaugural Sustainability Report 

(the “Report”) for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 

(“FY2017”). The Report is in accordance with Global Reporting 

Initiative (“GRI”) standards – core option that contains the key 

materiality issues identified through materiality assessment and will 

be produced annually. 

The Group continuously seeks for annual improvement over 

its sustainability reporting. We want to share our sustainability 

journey and are fully committed to listening to our stakeholders. 

We welcome any questions or feedback regarding the Report at 

enquiries@thakralcorp.com.sg.

The Group is pleased to publish the Report for FY2017, which is also the Group’s inaugural Sustainability Report. The Report, 

prepared in accordance with GRI Standards, demonstrates the Group’s commitment towards operational sustainability and 

corporate responsibility.

The Management has established a Sustainability Working Group (“SWG”), which works under the guidance of the Company’s 

Board of Directors (the “Board”) to ensure that sustainability measures are implemented across the business. The SWG will 

measure and review progress towards our sustainability goals and engage accountable stakeholders to ensure targets are met.

Environment 

The Management is committed to being environmentally conscientious by meeting all applicable green standard and energy 

efficiency in our day-to-day business operations across the region.

• In Australia, our Investment Division continues to encourage its partners to meet all applicable green standards, obtain 

energy efficiency and green ratings wherever possible and to deliver designs and use eco-friendly materials to minimise the 

environmental impact on the community where the developments are located. The Group’s joint venture retirement living 

resorts under the GemLife brand are designed to offer residents high quality liveable units that are both attractive and  

environmentally-friendly.

• In Japan, energy efficient air-conditioning and lighting was installed during renovation of certain properties during the year.

• Our Lifestyle Division has limited ability to influence environmental, social and governance practices of its business associates. 

On the supply side, the division generally receives pre-packaged finished goods from brand-owners or vendors and has little 

say in the manufacture of such products.  Manufacturers/brand-owners continue to adapt to present day consumer demand 

that leans towards environmentally-friendly products.  Logistics partners for bulk shipments are generally appointed by the 

larger suppliers themselves with cost, margins and speed-to-market being major considerations in the choice of service 

provider.  On the sales side, customer requirements generally prevail in relation to packaging and timing of delivery which 

then determines the shipment/delivery mode.

• At the operational level, we also generally follow some basic environment-friendly practices such as switching off lights and 

air-conditioning in rooms or spaces unoccupied during the work-day, powering down personal computers overnight, on 

weekends and on holidays, using recycled printer toners, using PEFC certified paper (i.e., from sustainably managed forests, 

recycled and controlled sources) as well as disposing of used paper in a manner that enables recycling, etc.

Governance 

Corporate governance is at the heart of our business in achieving our sustainability goals regionally. Building a system in which 

high standards are upheld and best practices are applied business-wide is essential to our successful long-term performance. 

We strive to maintain integrity, transparency, accountability and discipline in all our practices and have put in place a robust 

governance framework to ensure we meet our objectives.

People 

We recognise the importance of attracting, retaining and developing a high-quality workforce in order to ensure the long-term 

success of our business. We have invested in training employees to promote professional and personal development as well as 

rewarding those who uphold our values within the organisation.

The Group continued its commitment towards supporting worthy social and community causes. We have donated 700 sets of 

new desks and chairs to TuanTuan Thakral Hope School in the GaoDian Township of Fexi County in China and 420 sets of air 

washers to various voluntary welfare organisations and orphanages in Singapore, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos.

Looking ahead, we hope to further improve our sustainability tracking through a target-based approach with clear and 

measurable metrics. In this Report, you will be provided with a balanced view of our position and performance with regard to 

some key issues and measurables.

We hope you find the Report interesting and informative as we continue our sustainability journey.

ABOUT 

US

Thakral Corporation Ltd, listed on the SGX Mainboard since December 1995, currently has two main business divisions – 

Investment Division and Lifestyle Division. 

The Group’s Investment Division invests or co-invests in real estate and other investment opportunities, including property-

backed financial instruments.  Through a joint venture, it has expanded its businesses into the development and management 

of retirement living resorts in Australia. Taking advantage of the positive trend in the Japanese property sector and the 

country’s economy, the Group has also expanded its investment footprint to Japan. With the completion of the acquisition of  

The Riverwalk office property, the Group has extended its property investments to Singapore.  

The Group’s Lifestyle Division is focused on marketing and distributing brands in the beauty, wellness and lifestyle categories, 

working with leading ecommerce platforms as well as traditional retailers, including at-home beauty and personal care device 

brands MTG Refa, Panasonic, Philips, ikoo and PMD, skin and hair care brands Canvas, Codage, Institut Karite Paris, John 

Masters Organics and Botanist, wellness brands MTG SIXPAD, Style Seat and Slendertone and lifestyle brands Apple and DJI. 

Greater China including Hong Kong, Southeast Asia and India are key markets for the Lifestyle Division and Australia and Japan 

for the Investment Division.

About our Investment Division and Lifestyle Division – two material 

components for our sustainability report

Investment Division

1. Australia

I. Thakral Capital Australia Pty Ltd, Brisbane and Sydney, Australia 

II. GemLife, Australia 

III. Thakral Capital Holdings Pte Ltd, Singapore 

The Group’s Investment Division was set up to create a sustainable second revenue stream and contribute to positive shareholder 

value. Via Thakral Capital Holdings Pte Ltd (“TCH”), the holding company of the Group’s Investment Division in Australia 

which was incorporated in 2009, the Group started operations in Australia as TCAP in early 2011, originating, packaging and 

managing investments in real estate projects. 

The Group’s Investment Division through the TCH group has been growing in Australia since 2010.  The division invested and 

committed capital in excess of A$380 million into projects with an end value surpassing A$3 billion. The Investment Division’s 

retirement living joint venture with the Puljich family, under the GemLife brand, leveraged on their 30 years of experience in 

building one of Australia’s most well-known and respected brands in the resort-style retirement homes sector. To date, five 

resorts with more than a thousand homes to be built throughout the east coast of Australia have been committed, of which 

three resorts have commenced construction. The Group’s diversification into the retirement living segment is expected to 

provide sustainable returns in a growing sector that is less affected by movements in the core housing market. 

2. Japan

I. Thakral Japan Properties Pte Ltd, Singapore 

The Group’s Investment Division, taking advantage of the uptrend in the Japanese property sector, in part buoyed by urban 

development projects undertaken ahead of the 2020 Olympics, World Expo 2025, and the country’s low interest rate, has 

diversified its portfolio to include Japanese investment properties. Via Thakral Japan Properties Pte Ltd (“TJP”), the Group’s 

portfolio currently comprises different asset classes in Osaka: three office buildings – Yotsubashi Nakano Building, Yotsubashi 

East Building and Legal Itachibori Building; two business hotels – Best Western Osaka Tsukamoto Hotel and R Hotels Inn Osaka 

Kita Umeda; as well as a retail redevelopment site in Namba. 

The division continues to seek additional properties to grow its investment portfolio in Japan. 

3. Singapore

I. Thakral Realty (S) Pte Ltd, Singapore 

In line with the Group’s strategic thrust to expand its investment portfolio in Southeast Asia, the Group has made its maiden 

entry into the Singapore property market through acquisition of The Riverwalk office property in July 2018.  This is expected to 

provide a stable source of recurring rental income for the Group.

OUR APPROACH TO 

SUSTAINABILITY

The Group’s sustainability approach remains focused on value creation for all our stakeholders. The approach follows our 

sustainability policy which is to:

• observe and comply with all relevant legislation, regulations and codes of practice in all countries that we operate;

• consider sustainability issues in key areas of impact and integrate these considerations in business decisions;

• ensure all the Group’s stakeholders are aware of its sustainability initiatives and are committed to implementing, 

supporting and measuring these activities; and

• review, report and continuously strive to improve sustainability performance.

Sustainability is managed across the business through relevant policies, programmes and operating procedures that are in place. 

These are shared with all employees of the Group, supported with training and well-defined roles and responsibilities. This 

guides the management of the Group on its decision-making processes and ensures that we continually deliver on our business 

principles across all of our operations.

We employ a risk-based management approach. This involves reviewing our policies periodically, adjusting how we work in the 

event of any breach and reporting compliance.

We believe that to meet our sustainability goals and live by our values we need to integrate best practices into our day-to-day 

operations. Our aim is to contribute to local economies where we have a presence as well as to create a workplace that brings 

out the best in our employees. Most importantly, we want to build a sustainable business based on trust. The Group supports 

the precautionary approach by taking actions to reduce our environmental impact.

The Group is committed to integrating positive sustainability practices into our working environment and business processes. 

This is essential in order to deliver value to our business partners, foster trust with our communities, and ensure transparency 

and sustainable growth for our investors.

SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT 

STRUCTURE

Roles and responsibilities of Sustainability Working Group (the 

“SWG”)

The SWG, guided and supported by an external sustainability consultancy firm, leads the way as we continue our journey in 

strengthening our sustainability practices. It reports to the Board which is responsible for considering sustainability issues as part 

of the Group’s strategic formulation.  The SWG’s duties include:

• advising the Board and recommending business strategies in the area of sustainability;

• providing recommendations to the Board relating to the adoption, implementation and monitoring of sustainability-

related policies;

• engaging the Board for approval of sustainability initiatives;

• monitoring the implementation of Board-approved sustainability strategies;

• overseeing stakeholder engagement and management, including ensuring grievance-handling mechanisms are in place;

• overall management and prioritisation of sustainability matters; and

• overseeing the preparation of sustainability disclosures as required by laws and/or rules, and recommending to the 

Board for approval.

The other principle objective of the SWG is to help stakeholders to understand how sustainability issues may impact the 

business. It also provides the following:

• Coordinate and communicate the sustainability information; 

• Share and promote best practice within the market and industry; 

• Engage with stakeholders on environmental issues and regulation affecting the current business;

• Provide a necessary coordination responding to authority, and consultations on sustainability related matters; and

• Support the Group on liaison with government departments and regulators regarding sustainability reporting.  

The Group has mobilised core SWG members who fully understand its businesses across the region and are extensively 

experienced in its systems and processes, thus contributing to a quality sustainability report.

SCOPE OF 

REPORT

The scope of this Report covers the business operations of the Investment and Lifestyle divisions of the Group.

In defining the Report's content and the aspect boundaries, the Group considered the principles of materiality, stakeholder 

inclusiveness, sustainability context and completeness. In determining the materiality factors, the Group has engaged key 

stakeholders through various channels, including formalised surveys. The sustainability concerns from the various stakeholders 

were then consolidated and prioritised into a materiality matrix. Please refer to the stakeholder engagement table and materiality 

matrix in the following pages.

External charters and principles

The Group’s policies and business activities are aligned to the global standards and are supported by a variety of external 

charters and principles. These include but are not limited to:

• Applicable provisions of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289);

• Listing Manual issued by SGX-ST;

• Code of Corporate Governance 2012; and

• Other policies and procedures adopted by the Group, which can be found in the corporate governance section.

Accordingly, we have developed and adopted a range of corporate policies and internal controls that support the Board 

and management. These policies and controls cover matters such as personal data protection, anti-money laundering and 

countering terrorism financing, whistle-blowing, conflicts of interest, business continuity, insider dealing and enterprise risk 

management.

ENGAGING 

STAKEHOLDERS 

Our stakeholders are diverse, reflecting the breadth of our footprint within local reach of an Asia Pacific market.

We have identified our main stakeholder groups using the GRI standards and have put in place processes for effective 

communication with the key stakeholders.

Based on influence, representation, responsibility, dependency and proximity, we have narrowed down seven main stakeholder 

groups. Understanding these key sustainability concerns are essential in building a sustainable business.

In the future, the Group foresees it will be dealing with more sophisticated and diverse stakeholders, in order to serve the next 

stage of its development. The Group would need to be responsive to stakeholders’ concerns by engaging them to improve its 

sustainability reporting process to ultimately enhance stakeholders' value through business practices.
