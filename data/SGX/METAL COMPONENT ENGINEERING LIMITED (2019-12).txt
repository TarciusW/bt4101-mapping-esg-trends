4 INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY INTO OUR BUSINESS 

The Company believes that corporate social responsibility is a key driver towards long-term 

sustainability. Such responsibility is pragmatically integrated into our business practices as one of the 

core values in our corporate culture. Embedding such responsibility into our management processes 

across the value chain allows us to establish credibility among our stakeholders. Through our action 

today, we play a part in influencing the environment for our future generations. Through integrating 

the notion of sustainability in our business, we ensure that our business strategy and operations are 

in line with a long-term vision towards a conducive and sustainability future. 

4.1 Sustainability Management Framework 

In July 2017, the Company establish the sustainability reporting framework, performing an analysis on 

the business and operation model as the basis for stakeholder mapping and materiality assessment. 

Through this analysis, the Company identified five key stakeholder groups within our sustainability 

context and their respective material issues to be shown later in this report. 

4.2 Key Stakeholders and Material Issues 

The Company regularly reviews, assess and collects feedback on ESG issues through regular risk 

assessments; which entails the identification, assessment and documentation of material risks (for 

example, fraud, corruption, environmental, health &amp; safety and ESG relevant human capital risks) and 

corresponding internal controls. The Company continuously improves the adequacy and effectiveness 

of its risk assessment process in response to the changing business and operation environment. 

The Company identifies and reviews material issues most relevant and significant to its stakeholders. 

For external stakeholders, priority is afforded to issues important to the society and applicable to us. 

Thereafter, the Company prioritizes sustainability efforts and report issues that are most material to 

the business and the stakeholders. In consideration of specific stakeholders and material issues which 

are country specific, this report focuses on stakeholder engagement and material issues for Singapore 

operations.

4.3 Alignment with International Initiatives 

4.3.1 

Sustainable Development Goals  

Established in 1945 under the Charter of the United Nations (the “Charter”), the general assembly 

occupies a central position as the chief deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the 

United Nations. Comprising all 193 Members of the United Nations, it provides a unique forum for 

multilateral discussion of the full spectrum of international issues covered by the Charter. It also plays 

a significant role in the process of standard-setting and the codification of international law. 

On 25 September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the 17 Sustainable 

Development Goals (“SDG”) to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all as part 

of a new sustainable development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to be achieved over the next 

15 years. Although the SDGs are primarily aimed at governments, they represent an important 

opportunity for businesses to also act for a more sustainable world. We will use SDGs as one of the 

guiding principles for our sustainability initiatives.

Sustainability Report  





Sustainability Report  



We acknowledge that our participation in reaching the SDGs has room for improvement. As we 

advance on our sustainability journey, we will continue to assess our alignment with the SDGs and, 

whenever possible, redirect our internal priorities and sustainability strategy to more effectively and 

comprehensively address the goals. 

SDGs Logo Source: http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/news/communications-material 

SDG Goal 

Relevant Targets to Our Businesses 

(Source: 

http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org) 

Our Participation 

 

13.3: Improve education, awareness-raising, 

and human and institutional capacity on 

climate change mitigation, adaptation, 

impact reduction and early warning. 

We have our own internal processes and 

environmental policies to reduce electricity 

and fuel consumption. Our approach to 

mitigating climate change includes staff 

training and implementing energy-efficient 

measures. We monitor and report our 

Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions and set 

reduction targets. 

 

15.1: By 2020, ensure the conservation, 

restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial 

and inland freshwater ecosystems and their 

services, in particular forests, wetlands, 

mountains and drylands, in line with 

obligations under international agreements. 

All the paper used in our offices is Forest 

Stewardship Council (“FSC”) certified. We 

actively promote the use of FSC paper across 

our organization. 

 

 

 

 

 

The following SDG goals are relevant to our 

business, operations and value chain. They are 

addressed in our various policies at the Group 

level. Such goals are also embedded in various 

initiatives carried out across the organization. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We do not believe these goals are relevant to our 

business or industry. They are not within our 

boundaries and scope of influence, and therefore, 

we are currently unable to make noticeable 

contributions to such goals. 

 

 

 

 

 

4.3.2 

United Nation Global Compact   

The United Nations Global Compact (“UNGC”) is a United Nations initiative to encourage businesses 

worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies, and to report on their 

implementation. The UNGC is a principle-based framework for businesses, stating ten principles in the 

areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption.

5 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

Good CSR practices goes hand-in-hand with corporate management. It is vital that the Company’s 

management approaches are adaptable to the business dynamics and operational environment in 

ways which the Company is able to continuously assess the impact, develop sustainability objectives 

and respond in an appropriate manner to meet stakeholders’ expectations. The Company’s CSR 

framework is based on our approach to sustainability which includes policies and measurement 

mechanisms to monitor the impact made by the Company’s businesses and operations. 

The key to the Company’s success of the sustainability programme is via regular and up-to-date 

communications on CSR policies and activities to our stakeholders. Stakeholders are encouraged to 

provide feedback (through the appropriate channels) on the Company’s performance. This 

sustainability report forms a critical component to the continuous cycle of communication and 

evaluation. The overall sustainability context of stakeholder engagement is managed through the CSR 

plan for the Company’s sustainability governance oversight.

5.1 Protecting Our Environment for the Future Generations 

5.1.1 

Our approach 

The Company is committed to maintain and enhance the adopted environmental policies and 

standards. We continually seek new and innovative ways to maintain the quality of our products and 

services and reduce the environmental impact, as it is our responsibility to protect the health and 

wellbeing of the future generations.

Sustainability Report  



5.1.2 

Reduction in carbon footprint 

The Company recognizes that effective management and monitoring of the carbon footprint may 

potentially reduce operating costs, raise brand profile and increase stakeholder value. Our carbon 

footprint is measured in terms of GHG emission which is an absolute measure of the amount of carbon 

dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emitted2.  

The Company targets to achieve an absolute improvement in GHG emission efficiency by 10% from 

the base, set in 2017, by 20303. The GHG index continued to reduce from 75 in 2017 to 65 in 2019, a 

13% reduction. Although emissions vary amongst differing business lines, environmental objectives of 

each business line have been aligned with the targeted emission improvements.  

5.1.3 

Reduction in paper consumption 

All employees are encouraged to minimize paper wastage and adhere to the Internal Paper Usage 

Reduction Guidelines4. The Company targets to reduce paper consumption by 10% from the base, set 

in 2017, by 20305. Although paper consumption varies amongst differing business lines, objectives of 

each business line have been aligned with the targeted consumption improvements.  

The Company had a further 10.3% decrease in paper consumption in weight from FY2017 to FY20196. 

Paper consumption index stands at 73.6 (kg/million SGD), which is a decrease of 4.6% as compared to 

FY2018 at 77.1 (kg/million SGD). We normalize the amount of weights of paper consumed by the 

amount of our revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. The paper consumption 

index is measured in kilograms per SGD million. The Company continues to promote the use of less 

paper and rely on digital reporting. 

 

 

 

 

2 The Company measures its GHG emissions via Scope 1 and 2 (insignificant direct and predominantly indirect respectively) but does not 

include Scope 3 (GHG emissions generated by suppliers). 

3 Average GHG emission improvement per year is approximately 14.0%, in absolute quantity for the past two years. 

4 For example, double-sided printing is set as a default, lower grammage paper is used for daily printing and drafts are printed on blank 

sides of unwanted single-sided papers. Waste paper from the Company is collected for recycling. Employees are encouraged to utilize digital 

documents to further reduce paper consumption.

Employee feedback  

We value our employees’ expertise in their areas of responsibility and their feedback is important to 

the improvement of the overall management and operation of the organization. Through various 

established processes of employee engagement (such as employee objective setting, performance 

review and exit interview), the Company gathers valuable feedback from Employee Opinion Survey 

(EOS 2019) for continuous improvement of the organization. 

Other feedback channels are available for areas relating to the specific business functions and the 

Company has also established a whistle-blowing policy on control and compliance issues. Feedback 

escalation procedures to the senior management are also in place.

different job scopes and skills set requirements. Core training curriculum and contents are developed 

and guided by well-established industry and international standards such as ISO 9100, ISO 14000 and 

IATF 16949. Specific training curriculums are developed on the specific requirements of the businesses. 

Training topics ranges from soft skills development (such as communication and leadership) to 

technical programmes (such as project management and office productivity tools).  

In FY2019, each employee received an average of 4 training hours (as compared to 5 hours in FY2018). 

The Company recognizes that training requirements may vary depending on the level of management 

responsibility. Each senior manager registered an average of 6 hours of training while managerial and 

non-managerial staff received an average of 9 and 6 hours of training respectively. In light of the 

challenging  business situation, we will defer learning opportunities and find other approaches to 

improve the skills competencies of our staff. We continue to revise our training curriculum and 

programme to align with organizational objectives and to strive for effectiveness and efficiency in our 

training approach.

5.4 Supporting for Our Community 

5.4.1 

Our Approach 

We provide support to the communities. The key motivation driving all our community engagement 

initiatives is to enable and empower young people. By supporting young people today and helping to 

educate them about the world they are to inherit, our goal is to benefit not only the current generation, 

but also the next. We welcome school educational visit to our plant and support student internship 

and attachment where appropriate.  

We also recognize that meeting the needs of today’s youth goes beyond their own education, security 

and well-being, extending to that of their families, homes and neighbourhoods as well. To this end, 

our engagement programmes also encompass financial and practical support in carefully selected 

communities, through fundraising and voluntary activities.  

Our community initiatives are selected according to how closely they are aligned with our own 

community engagement goals of “enabling and empowering young people”, the anticipated staff 

participation rate, and the tangible impact on the beneficiary. Separately, we will also engage on other 

community initiatives on an ad hoc basis. All our business units and some of our channel partners are 

involved in our community engagement programmes.  

The culture and spirit of giving back to our society are ingrained into our business visions, and reflected 

our commitments under our various brands.

6 PERFORMANCE TABLE 

6.1 Energy Usage and CO2 Emissions  

Direct and indirect CO2 emissions in GHG emissions are measured in tonnes (t-CO2) and kilowatt hours 

(kWh), from electricity and fuel consumed. The electricity and fuel we purchase are both from non-

renewable sources. 

Our business and function grow over time, and the GHG emissions and electricity consumption vary. 

To ensure consistency and comparability of the GHG emission and electricity consumption measures 

over time, we create a GHG emission index and electricity consumption index for our performance 

monitoring. The index adjusts the GHG emissions and electricity consumption for the size of our 

activities. We normalize the amount of GHG emissions and electricity consumption by the amount of 

our revenues which we use as a proxy to the size of our activities. The GHG emission index is measured 

in t-CO2 per SGD million and the electricity consumption index is measured in kWh per SGD million.

As for FY2019, the GHG Emission Index registered a reduction of 14.5% and Electricity 

Consumption Index registered a reduction in quantity of 8.6% from 2018. We will continue 

to look for opportunity and cost-benefit solution, for example, exploring the use of 

alternative and complimentary power sources.

6.2 Paper Consumption 

We captured the data for paper consumption by how many reams of paper used where one ream is 

equivalent to 500 sheets of paper. To ensure consistency and comparability across various paper sizes, 

such as A3 and A4 papers, we measured the paper consumption by the weight of paper used which is 

adjusted for the various sizes and quality of papers. 

Our business and function grow over time and the paper consumption patterns vary. We devise a 

paper consumption index for our performance monitoring. The index adjusts the paper consumption 

for the size of our activities. We normalize the amount of weights of paper consumed by the amount 

of our revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. The paper consumption index is 

measured in kilograms per SGD million.

In FY2019, the Paper Consumption Index decreased by 4.6% with a reduction in usage 

quantity in kg by 5.8%, despite with a slight reduction in sales. More effort needed to 

reduce usage through closer monitoring and improving in processes, for example, we had 

been using our computer notebooks in meetings and in e-reporting. We have also switched 

from 80g paper to 70g paper, with some cost reduction.
