BOARD  

STATEMENT

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) is pleased to present 

TMG’s 2018 Sustainability Report (the “Report”).

In April 2018, the acquisition of the healthcare businesses 

was completed. With the divestment of the Real Estate 

business on 31 January 2019, TMG is now focused on 

building its healthcare platform, taking the first step towards 

achieving TMG’s vision of developing the Pan-Asian Health 

System of choice to provide the highest quality of health 

and medical services in the region. This Report focuses 

on the healthcare businesses as these will be the Group’s 

core businesses going forward. This Report encapsulates 

our overarching approach towards environmental, social 

and governance (“ESG”) risks and opportunities and its 

performance in our Singapore healthcare operations. 

Sustainability continues to be part of our strategy to foster 

innovation and create long-term value for our stakeholders. 

We believe that good ESG management helps to build a 

reliable and resilient business. We conducted a materiality 

assessment to further our sustainability journey and focus 

our efforts on the ESG issues that are most relevant to our 

stakeholders and healthcare businesses.  

The Board has approved the material ESG factors identified 

and continues to manage and monitor our ESG performance 

with the support of the Sustainability Steering Committee 

(“SSC”) and Sustainability Task Force (“STF”). Moreover, 

the Board oversees the overall sustainability direction and is 

responsible for approving this Report. 

We believe that TMG is well-positioned to build a 

sustainable business that makes a positive difference to our 

environment and communities. As we grow our business, 

we will continue to enhance our sustainability strategy, 

approach and performance to reach our objectives.

ABOUT  

THIS REPORT

The Group’s healthcare business comprises Thomson 

Medical in Singapore and TMC Life Sciences in Malaysia. 

Sustainability information of our operations in Malaysia can 

be found in TMC Life Sciences’s 2018 Sustainability Report 

published as part of its 2018 Annual Report. 

This Report only covers our operations in Singapore, which 

includes Thomson Medical Centre, our hospital held under 

Thomson Medical Pte Ltd (“TMPL”) as well as our clinics 

island-wide.

TMPL’s sustainability report provides an overview of TMPL’s 

sustainability approach, practices and performance for the 

financial year ended 31 December 2018.

This Report has been prepared in accordance with the 

Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards 2016 – Core 

option. The GRI Standards is an internationally recognised 

reporting framework that provides useful guidance to 

TMPL not only on report quality but also on materiality, 

stakeholder inclusiveness and performance indicators. 

The Report does not disclose the targets of the material 

factors for the forthcoming year as the Group has been 

undergoing restructuring after the acquisition of the 

healthcare businesses. We are committed to align our 

sustainability objectives with our business strategy and we 

will disclose the targets of the material factors in our next 

year’s report. 

The Report, together with the Annual Report, aim to 

provide comprehensive and transparent reporting of our 

overall objectives and performance to TMPL’s stakeholders. 

In line with the Group’s commitment to environmental 

sustainability, no hardcopies of this report have been 

printed. The report can be viewed on our website: www.

thomsonmedicalgroup.com/investor-relations/annual-

reports/. 

 

As we continuously seek to improve our performance,

EXPERIENCE





Customer Satisfaction

At TMPL, our customers are our priority as we aim to 

build long-term relationships with them and their families. 

We strive to provide our customers with memorable 

experiences, personalised to their diverse needs. 

TMPL has considered patients’ needs, preferences and 

expectations for their choice of the healthcare centre 

in its design and planning of services. It is paramount 

to continuously improve the quality of services. When 

patients have a good perception of the quality of 

healthcare services at TMPL, they are likely to return and 

make recommendations to their families and friends. In 

addition to having extensive services and desirable quality 

of service, we take one step further to continue to innovate 

services and customised post treatment for our customers. 

Some of these services include confinement food home 

delivery service, home care visits by lactation consultants, 

training for helpers at home and a loyalty programme with 

benefits to allow our patients to use services within TMPL. 

Patients who deliver at our hospital are provided with 

follow-up services by our lactation consultants, such as 

a post-discharge phone call to support, coach and guide 

our patients to achieve success in breastfeeding. Patients 

who delivered their babies and were discharged over the 

weekend are entitled to a free phone consultation and half 

an hour personalised parent craft clinic visit review by our 

lactation consultants. 

Our Customer Experience Committee (“CEC”) oversees 

patient experience, an indicator that measures the 

performance of TMPL. The CEC develops the service 

excellence framework, executes customer service strategy, 

ensures consistency of service standards on-site and off-

site TMPL environment and develop and spread service 

improvement initiatives to enhance the overall patient

experience. Providing direction and guidance on service 

related policy, process issues and for senior leadership 

engagement and reinforcement, as well as identifying 

opportunities and recommending initiatives for service 

improvements are amongst the several responsibilities of 

the CEC. Meetings of the CEC are held quarterly, ensuring 

that matters related to quality of service provided to 

customers are reviewed on a regular basis. 

TMPL believes that improved staff experience ultimately 

leads to improved patient experience. Thus, staff undergo 

service training programmes, coaching, audits and rewards 

and recognitions in collaboration with Human Resources 

Department to teach and reinforce service behaviours and 

standards. More information on development opportunities 

for staff can be found under “Training and Education” on 

page 14-15 of the Sustainability Report. 

As part of our Standard Operating Procedure (“SOP”), we 

have set in place a process relating to the management 

of patients’ complaints. Complaints are received either 

verbally via nurse managers, ward rounds and doctors 

or in writing via email or letters, Patient’s Evaluation 

Questionnaire (“PEQ”) and Facebook. We are able to 

improve on the clinical and service quality through reviewing 

and addressing the complaints received from the patients. 

Our efforts in providing quality service to our patients are 

translated in the many awards that we won in the Singapore 

Health Quality Service Awards 2018 as well as the results 

of our PEQ. Our performance and targets are reviewed 

annually. In 2018, TMPL met our target in relation to 

customer satisfaction set in the previous year. The following

Customer Health and Safety

As a healthcare provider, TMPL is responsible for protecting 

its customers’ health and safety through quality treatments 

as well as its management systems and facilities design. 

Improving the quality and safety of healthcare services 

remains a key concern for healthcare leaders and 

practitioners. 

TMPL has in place a Property and Operational Support 

Quality Committee (“POSQC”) which allows for open 

channels of communication with mutual trust for 

interdepartmental collaboration. This in turn creates a 

platform to continuously review the structures, systems and 

processes, identify gaps and initiate effective strategies to 

minimise institution risks, provide high quality and safe care 

and promote health and safety to our customers at TMPL. 

Meetings within the POSQC are held every other month as 

we recognise the importance of keeping abreast with the 

latest requirements in safeguarding our customers’ health 

and safety. 

As part of our Hospital Administrative Policy, TMPL has 

set in place a Quality Improvement and Patient Safety Plan. 

The purpose of this is to ensure that a coordinated and 

integrated approach is defined for managing patient safety, 

quality assurance and improvement activities so as 

to reduce risks to customers and improve clinical, 

operational processes and outcomes. A Quality and Safety 

Plan (“QPS”) Framework stipulates specific key strategic 

thrusts that relate to clinical risk management, patient 

safety, quality service and performance improvement. 

These include service and system initiatives which deal 

with fundamental quality assurance, quality improvement, 

patient safety basics, service standards, people 

development and organisation business excellence and 

evidence-based practices.

Hand hygiene audits were conducted monthly and food 

hygiene audits were conducted weekly during the year. The 

hand hygiene audit covers the 5 Moments of Hand Hygiene, 

evidence-based guidelines from WHO. This is also reflected 

in IPSG 5 of the Joint Commission International Standards. 

The 5 Moments of Hand Hygiene are as follows; before 

touching patient, before starting a clean procedure, after 

exposure to body fluid, after touching a patient and after 

touching patient surroundings. There were over 10,000 

hand hygiene observations conducted, which achieved a 

compliance rate of 88%, above the benchmark of 80% from 

Australian National Hand Hygiene Audit Program1. Moment 1, 

before touching the patient and moment 5, after touching 

patient’s surroundings such as touching the bed-rails etc. 

required reinforcement through education and campaigns.

The food hygiene audit criteria was adapted from National 

Environmental Agency’s Food Hygiene Audit Checklist. 

This covers general condition of the kitchen, storage of 

food, functionality of refrigerators and cold room, diet 

presentation and quality, cleaning standard and staff 

hygiene.  Weekly food hygiene audits were conducted 

in 2018.  The audit achieved a result of 84% compliance. 

There were positive results of food services and storage 

processes. However, there were challenges in consistently 

maintaining a clean and dry environment.

TMPL strives to meet the International Patient Safety 

Goals (“IPSG”) as part of ensuring our customers’ health 

and safety. The purpose of the IPSG, as referenced from 

Joint Commission International, is to promote specific 

improvements in patient safety, highlight problematic 

areas in healthcare and apply evidence-based expert-

based consensus solutions to these problems. The IPSGs 

will be part of the overall Quality and Patient Safety Plan 

and TMPL’s Annual Quality Dashboard. We have selected 

the following goals from the IPSG to ensure the delivery of 

safe care to our patients and focus on our performance 

improvement. The following performance shows that we 

have achieved our goals during the year:

CULTURE



Occupational Health and Safety

Minimising incidents of work-related injury and illness will 

positively impact TMPL’s health and safety performance and 

build employees’ morale. In order to provide our patients 

with quality service and care, a safe workplace has to be 

established for our staff. 

Our Workplace Safety and Health Risk Management 

Committee (“Committee”) has the overall responsibility for 

quality improvement, patient and staff safety in the hospital. 

It provides an oversight for the continuous improvement 

activities identified in the required and desired measures. 

This Committee is the driver of all quality and patient safety 

initiatives for the hospital and oversees staff related injuries 

such as needlestick injuries. These initiatives are aligned 

with the TMPL Quality and Patient Safety Framework. 

Our Workplace Safety and Health Risk Management 

Committee oversees our SOP for hazard identification and 

risk assessment. The purpose of the SOP is to establish 

standard procedure to identify hazards relating to 

occupational health and safety, evaluate the risks associated 

with these hazards and to ensure that appropriate actions 

are taken to manage the risks involved. The following 

diagram illustrates the procedure outline in relation to 

hazards at TMPL:

Sustainability Report 2018

As depicted in diagram 1, risk assessment and control 

measures are in place in order to manage the identified 

risks/ hazards. TMPL has an internal prompt list for hazard 

identification. The hazard identification process considers 

all activities, both routine and non-routine. All potential 

hazards associated with contractors and visitor activities 

are also considered during the hazard identification 

process. All potential hazards are identified and recorded, 

regardless of their likelihood of occurrence. The Head of 

Department (“HOD”) and the Risk Assessment (“RA”) team 

are responsible for the risk assessment process, including 

hazard identification, preparation and conducting of risk 

assessment, evaluation of risk, implementation of control 

measures, follow up and review of effectiveness of control 

measures. Staff are encouraged to participate in the risk 

assessment or assist in conducting the risk assessment. 

Control measures are implemented in the following 

sequence:

• 

Eliminate the hazards altogether at source   

• 

Reduce the risks through Substitution 

• 

Apply Engineering Control to limit/isolate the hazards at 

source 

• 

Apply Administrative Control  

• 

Provide Personal Protective Equipment 

Staff are required to report all adverse incidents to the 

HOD/ Manager as soon as the incident occurs and put up 

a Hospital Occurrence Reporting (“HOR”) form. At TMPL, 

we adopt Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 

Patient Safety Network framework on culture of safety to 

create a blame free environment where staff are able to 

report errors and near misses without fear of reprimand 

or punishment. The HOD will conduct root cause analysis 

to determine system gaps. However, if deliberate violation 

of safety procedures were identified, Human Resource 

(“HR”) and HOD will counsel the staff and institute actions 

such as monitoring, re-training and warning as appropriate. 

Staff are also required to inform their supervisors of any 

shortcomings in the safe work procedures or risk control 

measures. 

An emergency response plan which details the various 

measures and operational actions that need to be 

undertaken by TMPL in the event of any fire or other 

emergencies to minimise injury to personnel and damage 

to property is in place. A fire safety training is conducted 

on a bi-annual basis to staff. The HOR SOP incorporates 

reporting and investigation of incidents, recording of 

incident details as well as immediate actions taken to 

mitigate the problems and prevent recurrences. 

Another SOP of occupational health and safety is the 

management of sharp injury/ blood and body fluids 

exposure. The infection control manager (“ICM”) oversees 

matters pertaining to this SOP. The ICM conducts a risk 

assessment of sharp injury and discusses with the affected 

staff on the possible risks in the event of a needlestick, 

patient bite or sharp injury. As a means of minimising the 

incidences of needlestick injuries, training is provided for 

induction programme for new nurses and staff are re-

trained. During the year, there were zero recordable work-

related injuries for employees and workers who are not 

employees but whose work and or workplace is controlled 

by TMPL. 

Several initiatives in relation to occupational health and 

safety have been implemented by TMPL. These include a 

fire safety training conducted by the fire safety manager 

twice a year at the hospital and a risk assessment exercise 

which is reviewed and updated thrice a year. In addition, 

a health screening is conducted every other year for 

employees. TMPL provides recreational activities to 

promote a healthier lifestyle such as regular scenic walks at 

various parks in Singapore, Zumba classes etc. Due to the 

nature of our operations, staff are not required to work off-

site. Staff who are required to travel overseas are insured. 

All staff are provided with medical and healthcare benefits. 

A vaccination program which is conducted on employees on 

an annual basis is in place. 

As a result of our collaborative efforts in safeguarding the 

health and safety of our staff, there were zero workplace 

fatalities and zero high-consequence work-related 

injuries in 2018.

EMPLOYEE  

CULTURE 

Training and Education

A diverse workforce and long term service employees 

contribute to the quality of the services that TMPL provides, 

hence promoting business growth. TMPL has a relatively 

diverse workforce of different age groups, as seen in table 

4. TMPL’s employees are largely female due to the nature of 

our business, which focuses to a large part on women and 

children healthcare. 

Monthly new hire rate at TMPL is 1.5% while the monthly 

new hire rate for the industry is 1.7%2. This is reflective of 

the good retention of our staff. On the other hand, monthly 

turnover rate at TMPL is 0.8%, lower than the monthly 

industry turnover rate of 1.2% in 20183. This reflects the 

success of our human resource management policy in 

recruitment, job-fit, job satisfaction, conducive workplace 

which results in our ability to retain staff and provide them 

opportunities for long-term career with TMPL.

skills and best practices is crucial to the delivery of quality 

patient care and services to our patrons and their family 

members. In addition, a well-trained workforce improves 

employee morale and talent retention by fulfilling their 

potential and ensures their skill-sets remain current.

TMPL has in place a training policy which strives to develop 

staff members’ work potential and ability. An annual Training 

and Development Needs Analysis is conducted and involves 

each staff member and their Immediate Head in identifying 

and agreeing on their training needs. The Human Resource 

Department and Nursing Administration Department are 

responsible for nursing staff’s training related matters. All 

employees undergo a robust annual performance appraisal. 

We provide trainings such as general training, competency 

based training as well as specialty training to employees 

according to their roles. For example, our front service staff 

are provided with service training while our support staff 

such as Operations and Finance undergo technical skills 

upgrades and attend relevant seminars and conferences. 

Our employee learning and development interventions 

and programmes include advanced diplomas and degrees 

on specific allied health programmes and informal 

interventions such as on-the-job coaching.

Training and education related initiatives held during the 

year include development of a potential assessment system 

for nurses to guide efforts on training, creation of core 

competency programmes for paediatrics and Obstetrics 

&amp; Gynaecology (“O&amp;G”) as well as creation of preceptor 

skills programmes. The following are examples of our 

development programmes for our nurses:

Thomson Touch

Thomson Touch is a development programme 

dedicated to providing tailored training for 

our nurses. This programme provides nurses 

with skills that ensure quality care and service 

are provided to our patients. Thomson Touch 

highlights our commitment to our patients as we 

dedicate extra investment into the training of 

our nurses.

Diploma programme for nurses

TMPL sponsors selected nurses to attend a full-

time advanced diploma programme as a means of 

upgrading their skill level. The programme focuses 

on paediatrics and medicine. Nurses are selected 

based on their performance, and undergo this 

programme for 9 months. TMPL believes that 

investment in our staff would allow them to provide 

our patients with quality care and service.

Nursing staff

Non-nursing staff

Nursing staff refer to healthcare assistants and the 

like, while non-nursing staff include sonographers, 

radiographers, pharmacists, management, administrative 

staff etc. Due to the roles and responsibilities of nurses, 

nursing staff undergo the most number of training hours as 

compared to our non-nursing staff. Most of our nurses and 

allied health employees are female due to the nature of our 

business which focuses on women and children. Hence, the 

number of training by gender is irrelevant to our business 

and has not been disclosed.

GOVERNANCE

Environmental Compliance

TMPL understands the importance of compliance with 

environmental laws and regulations to maintain its licence 

to operate. In addition to environmental compliance, 

proper environmental management helps TMPL minimise 

its business impacts to the environment. Efficiency is 

enhanced through use of more efficient cooling systems 

and regular maintenance of energy consuming equipment, 

thus minimising cost to the business.

Waste including bio-hazard waste, cytotoxic waste and 

general waste are generated during our operations and 

we have an SOP in place to ensure the waste are disposed 

properly. The objective of the SOP is to lay down the 

guidelines for the proper disposal of bio-hazard waste, 

cytotoxic waste and general waste in order to safeguard 

staff from the dangers of injury and to comply with the 

legal requirements for proper disposal of waste. Our 

housekeepers ensure the different types of waste are 

kept and placed separately in the designated bin bags 

and bin centre and are collected and disposed of by 

licensed contractors. Needles and glass ampoules are 

disposed in sharps containers. Moreover, the bin center 

is checked by our housekeeping staff daily and is cleaned 

and disinfected when necessary. For bio-hazard wastes 

and cytotoxic waste, consignment chit is issued after every 

collection and acknowledged by our staff. Our efforts are 

part of compliance with infection control and regulatory 

requirements. 

In 2018, there were zero non-compliance incidents with 

environmental laws and or regulations which resulted in 

significant monetary fines, non-monetary sanctions or 

cases brought through dispute resolution mechanisms for 

non-compliance4. 

TMPL plays our part in reducing our environmental 

footprint beyond compliance. Over the past 2 years, 

we have progressively replaced our lightings with more

energy efficient LED lighting to our corridors, wards and 

staircases. This initiative contributed to approximately 2% 

savings in overall energy expenses per year. In August 2017, 

we embarked on a chiller replacement project to replace 

our existing air cooled chiller with a more energy efficient 

water cooled chiller. The new chiller started operations in 

July 2018, and we managed to achieve around 15% overall 

energy savings for the hospital as compared to 2017 for 

the same period. TMPL monitors our energy consumption 

through our monthly electricity bills. 

Compliance with Laws and Regulations

TMPL practises good corporate governance to operate in 

a highly regulated healthcare industry as non-compliance 

will result in hefty fines and reputational damage. Benefits 

of good corporate governance and compliance include 

securing stakeholders’ trust, economic growth, positive 

brand image and reputation as well as license to operate, 

amongst others. 

Processes have been continuously enhanced or set in place 

to ensure compliance with requirements set by Ministry of 

Health (“MOH”), Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act, 

Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”), Companies Act, the 

Stock Exchange of Singapore, Employment Act and other 

regulations and statutory requirements. The TMPL Chief 

Financial Officer is the appointed Data Protection Officer 

at TMPL. Directives from the MOH and other government 

bodies are disseminated to the relevant departments, 

and are updated in our SOP in relation to compliance with 

regulations and requirements. 

During the year, there were zero substantiated complaints 

concerning breaches of customer privacy and losses 

of customer data. Additionally, there were zero non-

compliance in relation to relevant laws and regulations 

where non-compliance would have resulted in significant 

monetary fines, non-monetary sanctions or cases brought 

through dispute resolution mechanisms5.

LOCAL  

COMMUNITIES

TMPL contributes to improving the nation’s total fertility rate 

and Singapore’s population through raising the community’s 

awareness on family planning and fertility issues. 

Several initiatives were implemented by TMPL during the 

year which target at improving the lives of women and 

children. We collaborated with various organisations to 

organise 8 large scale consumer seminars, reaching out 

to approximately 2,000 participants. These seminars are 

heavily subsidised by TMPL and participants pay a nominal 

fee to learn about pregnancy, baby care and parenting.

The seminars aim to educate mothers-to-be with 

knowledge from renowned obstetricians and paediatricians. 

Mothers-to-be are also empowered by hands-on 

training received at breastfeeding and baby-care 

workshops organised by International Board Certified  

Lactation Consultants. 

In the past 2 years, our fertility clinic, Thomson Fertility 

Centre (“TFC”) has partnered with I Love Children, the 

voluntary welfare organisation behind the annual Know 

Your Fertility Wellness Campaign. The campaign reaches 

out to young adults and couples island-wide on the topic 

of fertility health and family planning, with the purpose of 

helping young couples conceive and increasing Singapore’s 

birth rate by advocating a higher priority to having children. 

TFC has been supporting the campaign with complimentary 

fertility health screenings and our experts contributing 

to articles and roadshow talks. In 2018, TFC was the sole 

private fertility partner sponsoring 200 couples with fertility 

screening worth $400 for each screening.  

These included the public events on the education of 

pregnancy and childbirth as well as support the non-profit 

organisation “I Love Children” with free fertility screening to 

encourage couples to have children early.
