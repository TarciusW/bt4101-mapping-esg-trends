This report describes our sustainability performance for the period 

1 April 2018 – 31 March 2019 (“FY2019”). It covers all of Memories 

Group Limited’s (the “Company”, or collectively with its subsidiaries, 

“Memories Group”) activities in Myanmar and includes acquisitions 

that were completed by 31 March 2019 unless otherwise stated, and 

has been prepared taking reference from the SGX Sustainability 

Reporting Guidelines (set out in Listing Rule 711A and 711B of the 

Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing 

Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist). This report has been prepared in 

accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards – 

“Core” Option, which represents the global best practice for reporting 

on a range of economic, environmental and social impacts. 

The GRI Standards has been adopted as a framework for Memories 

Group Sustainability Report as it is internationally recognised and 

widely used sustainability reporting framework, which allows us to 

address our social, environmental and economic performance.

The boundary for this report is based on our operations in Myanmar.

Our annual Sustainability Report also provides us with a valuable 

opportunity to engage our stakeholders and respond to issues that 

matter most to them and to our business. It will continue to inform 

shareholders on company risk management, strategy development 

and stakeholder engagement activities as we work to further focus 

and prioritise our sustainability and corporate social responsibility 

initiatives.

Our Sustainability Report is produced on a yearly basis and is also 

available online on our corporate website.

We welcome comments and feedback on our sustainability report at 

sustainability@memoriesgroup.com.

BOARD STATEMENT

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) is pleased to present 

Memories Group’s Sustainability Report 2019, which is our Group’s 

second Sustainability Report. Memories Group’s sustainability 

approach is aligned to that of our affiliated company, Yoma 

Strategic Holdings Ltd., (“Yoma Strategic”) and premised on the 

recognition that Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) 

aspects are increasingly important to our stakeholders. The Board, 

together with the Management, is committed to managing relevant 

ESG risks and opportunities across our different assets, while 

contributing positively to the environment and society. The Board 

has considered the material ESG factors as part of its strategic 

formulation, determined the material ESG factors and overseen the 

management and monitoring of the material ESG factors.

Tourism has received increasing attention as a major economic 

driver, in particular for developing countries, and is also recognised 

as a mechanism to foster economic growth and development. It is 

essential for us to change our approach and optimise performance 

if we are to decouple the growth of our business from the increasing 

use of natural resources. 

Material ESG topics were identified in our first materiality 

assessment conducted in FY2018. In this Report for FY2019, we 

have continued to report on our sustainability performance in the 

Five Focus Areas - Governance, Respect for the Environment, 

Employability and Local Development, Our Customers and 

Preserving Local Heritage and Culture. The Board has considered 

the material ESG factors as part of its strategic formulation, 

determined the material ESG factors and overseen the management 

and monitoring of the material ESG factors. The report’s content 

has been reviewed and approved by the Board and Management of 

Memories Group and our Sustainability Committee. 

Memories Group’s sustainability efforts are structured around the 

guiding principles of the United Nations Sustainable Development 

Goals (“UNSDGs”), and our targets are aligned with the Myanmar 

Sustainable Development Plan (“MSDP”) 2018 - 2030, enabling us 

to create long-term value for our stakeholders.

committed to protecting natural and cultural 

heritage during development so that people

Myanmar as a sustainable destination and raise 

travellers’ awareness of sustainability issues while

The impacts of our material topics are important, both for our long-

term success as a company, and for our stakeholders. We understand 

that they affect the decisions that stakeholders make in relation to 

Memories Group. We also recognise that we have an impact on a 

wide range of stakeholders, both directly and indirectly. Memories 

Group uses a broad range of communication channels, creating 

customised messages and selecting the most effective channel for 

each of our stakeholder groups. Stakeholder requirements collected 

through these channels are addressed in a timely manner through 

collaboration with related business unit heads.

Our 

stakeholders 

identified 

include 

customers, 

suppliers, 

employees, investors, and the local community. These stakeholder 

groups are defined by the various businesses we engage in, and the 

people that we interact with and are accountable to. In FY2019, 

we initiated an internal employee survey to better understand 

what were the most material topics to them. We also have a team 

who engages frequently with the local community in areas where 

we operate, for example, at Pila Island, where our resort Awei Pila 

is located. Across Memories Group, the engagement with various 

stakeholders is summarised below.

The criteria for Memories Group’s material analysis were explored and selected based on industry international standards, peer 

benchmarking based on companies with similar operations, media analysis, internal responses and management awareness. Memories 

Group also considered the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”), major indices from external rating agencies, and 

both international and Myanmar focused environmental assessment and policy reports. The material topics identified from our initial 

workshop in 2018 were reviewed internally in 2019, and additional disclosures relevant for the material topics have been included in our

OUR APPROACH

Memories Group’s portfolio of hotels, experiences and 

services in unique locations of Myanmar provides our 

guests with personalised, authentic and experience-

driven travel. By interweaving the natural, historical 

and cultural elements of the country together, we create 

treasured memories for our guests. It is important 

that we embed our operations deeper into the life of 

the community we serve. We have also introduced 

nature-inspired programmes in some of our hotels to 

raise awareness amongst our guests and showcase the 

ecological heritage and biodiversity of these locations. 

It is important that the experience of our guests forms 

an important part of their overall experience of visiting 

Myanmar.

OUR CUSTOMERS


E N C H A N T ,  E N T H R A L ,  E N R A P T U R E

16

Our Vision: Customer Satisfaction

We serve our customers by being their trusted partner and by delivering the best products and services that cater to their needs.

WHAT WE HAVE DONE

Experiential and authentic travel for our customers

At Awei Pila, activities such as trekking, snorkelling, kayaking and 

scuba diving allow our guests to explore the unspoilt environment 

of the island and the diversity of the marine life. 

In planning for experiential holidays, AHTT / Memories Travel 

provides for those seeking adventure and immersion, ecotourism, 

luxurious cruises, wellness journeys, family holidays and 

honeymoons. Excursions are chosen with care, and before offering 

them to tourists they are evaluated on whether they are sustainable 

and comply with the standards set by AHTT / Memories Travel. 

No harm is done to the environment, heritage, animals or social 

aspects of the community that we operate in.

Safety and crisis management

Health and safety are important for both our customers and 

our staff. Our operations are equipped with all necessary safety 

equipment and signage and frequent quality checks are carried out 

on equipment with any replacements being made as necessary. First 

aid, fire safety and emergency evacuation training is provided to 

appropriate team members and any incidents of injury or illness are 

thoroughly investigated, with procedural changes put in place to 

prevent recurrence.

Safety briefings are provided to our Burma Boating, Balloons Over 

Bagan and Balloons Over Inle customers as well as those who join 

our experiential trips through AHTT / Memories Travel. More than 

half of our staff from Balloons Over Bagan and Balloons Over Inle 

are trained in basic first aid. Emergency drills are also carried out 

once every season for each location in Bagan and Inle, and there is 

also a safety management system in place with safe work procedures 

and a crisis management plan.

Customer satisfaction

Our frontline staff, managers of the hotels, guides from our 

experiential travel services and crew on the yachts and hot air 

balloons all strive to get to know our customers personally – their 

likes and dislikes, suggestions and concerns. Customer feedback is 

constantly analysed by management and team members in order 

to implement corrective and preventative actions accordingly. This 

helps in resolving issues quickly for our customers and builds our 

ongoing relationships with them. The strong commitment of all 

team members ensures a consistently high level of guest satisfaction.

We were aware from our customer feedback, that the competency 

of English of our staff was highlighted as an area for improvement. 

We have thus rolled out English classes across our Group in FY2019 

for all employees. More than half of our customers from our hotels, 

experiences and services who were surveyed in FY2019 have rated 

our services as either good or excellent.

WHAT WE PLAN TO DO

Monitoring the satisfaction of our customers is an important issue

RESPECT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

OUR APPROACH

Stewardship of the environment is an ongoing challenge 

as our business grows. Memories Group promotes 

responsible environmental practices by all our hotels 

and experiences and supports the hotels to improve 

environmental performance.

In Myanmar, solid waste is typically dumped into 

landfills and there is currently only one waste-to-

energy plant located in Shwepyithar Township in the 

northern part of Yangon. This waste to energy plant is 

able to handle 60 tonnes of waste per day, which is only 

about 2% of the estimated total waste of 2,500 tonnes 

generated every day in Yangon*.

RESPECT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

Memories Group is conscious of our own levels of resource 

consumption and waste generation, and has put in place various 

policies to minimize resource consumption and manage waste 

effectively. We have implemented a policy on “Environment, 

Health and Safety” (“EH&amp;S”) in support of a group wide Corporate 

Governance framework, to:

1. 

foster greater awareness of sustainable approaches across 

Memories Group;

2. 

enhance our capabilities to identify and manage adverse 

impacts from all business activities; and

3. 

instil a culture of “no harm, less pollution and wider 

conservation approaches to protect the environment” in all 

business operations.

We are committed to managing our waste properly, implementing 

the concept of a circular economy – reducing, reusing, recycling 

and replacing throughout our operations, where possible.

WHAT WE ARE DOING

Reduce impact of operations on environment, reduce use of 

plastics / Introducing and increasing recycling efforts

The issue of single-use plastics is a concern and one that clearly 

requires global commitment and collaborative action. In 2018 we 

embarked on the removal of plastic waste from our head office in 

Yangon, and this is currently being implemented across all our hotel 

operations, boating business and hot air balloon operations. As 

part of the Refill Not Landfill Southeast Asia programme, we have 

rolled out the use of stainless-steel bottles at targeted resorts/hotels 

to replace plastic bottles. Guests are provided with an aluminium 

bottle that can be refilled with water free of charge at more than 

100 designated water refilling stations around Myanmar. This is a 

first step to transition away from single-use plastics, and other items 

such as packaging and bathroom amenities are being assessed for 

reduction or replacement with sustainable alternatives. In line with 

our FY2019 target to minimise the use of plastics, approximately 

5,500 reusable aluminium bottles have been distributed in our 

hotels and experiences in FY2019 which has enabled us to avoid 

the use of approximately 189,3605 plastic bottles.

The nature of our operations produces waste that needs to be 

effectively managed. We are committed to managing our waste 

properly, implementing the concept of a circular economy 

– reducing, reusing, recycling and replacing throughout our 

operations, where possible. In line with our FY2019 target which 

was to minimise the use of plastics and harm to the environment, 

we have recycled 1.91 tonnes of glass and 425kg of plastic which 

were generated from our ballooning and hotels businesses.

The hotels have implemented a number of programmes that are 

specific to local circumstances for waste management, including 

waste segregation and recycling. At Awei Pila, our island resort 

and Burma Boating, which operates our sailing yachts, garbage 

separation is done to ensure that waste which can be recycled is 

sent for recycling. Reusable stainless-steel bottles are provided to 

our guests and no plastic straws or plastic bottles are used.

Awei Pila and Burma Boating hosted an expedition in May 2019 by 

a team of nine divers and five surface support crew to clear lost and 

disused fishing nets, also known as ghost nets, from the coral reefs 

in the Mergui Archipelago. Within four days, the divers recovered 

some 300kg of abandoned, lost or discarded fishing gear from the 

surrounding reefs at depths of up to 25 meters. The team was led by 

Ocean Quest Global, a Southeast Asia-based organisation dedicated 

to the protection and rehabilitation of coral reefs. Plans are in place 

for more of such similar activities to be conducted later this year. 

Awei Pila is also developing eco-friendly land and water activities 

for guests, as well as surveying the island reefs and mangroves to 

identify species and working out ways to encourage conservation 

and protection, including with the Moken and Burmese fishermen. 

A coral nursery is planned in the coming months which will be used 

to re-populate areas with damaged coral, and this project will be 

run in collaboration with the local Mokens.

Burma Boating has in its fleet, a fully solar-run yacht which is 

the first of its kind to sail in Asia. The yacht’s 30 mounted solar 

panels create 10 kWh, allowing it to cruise an unlimited distance 

on a regular sunny day – but also maintains a fuel-based back-up 

engine. It can reach a maximum speed of 12 knots thanks to its two 

30kW motors. This solar-run yacht leaves a minimal environmental 

footprint, but offers travellers unprecedented sailing comfort.

Water scarcity

Extreme weather conditions such as floods and droughts often affect Myanmar’s access to clean water. Management of water resources is 

important to ensure that there is a sustainable supply of water from ground water sources, or from the lakes and rivers. Memories Group 

wants to be recognised as a prudent and responsible user of water that does not adversely impact on local water resources.

Our hot air balloon business located in Bagan and Inle rely on well water which is used for cleaning the balloons and washing of linen. In 

FY2019, we used almost three times more water than we did in FY2018 for our ballooning business, which is largely due to an increase 

in the number of flights that have been provided and the additional cleaning required. The hotel operations largely rely on ground water 

and it is estimated7 that approximately 14,580m3 of water was consumed in FY2019. As most of our resorts and hotels in our portfolio 

became fully operational only in the second half of FY2019, we will continue to measure and monitor our water consumption to have a 

better understanding of our baseline.

We reduce pollution by ensuring that untreated wastewater from our hotel operations is not released into the natural ecosystem. Where 

water is used for washing or other purposes at our hotel operations and needs to be discharged into the surface drains, we will treat it with 

a bio filter and chlorine sterilization before discharge to ensure there is minimal impact to the local waterways. Where possible, water is 

recycled or reused for activities such as landscaping or for flushing of toilets.

NOTES:-

This estimation is based on an assumption of 300 litres of water used per guest per night.

Memories Group is part of the Refill Not Landfill campaign. This initiative aims to cut down 

on the millions of plastic water bottles discarded each year by offering an alternative: reusable 

aluminium bottles. These bottles can be refilled free of charge at our hotels and resorts, at our 

yachts and premises operated by our associated and affiliated companies, such as The Campus, 

Convenience Prosperity Company Limited (“CPCL”) branches, Pun Hlaing Estate, Yoma Bank 

branches across Myanmar, as well as other partners of the Refill Not Landfill program.

Emissions

Our Group-wide GHG emissions for FY2019 was 782 tCO2, which was 2.9 times more than what we used in FY2018. This is due largely 

to an increase in fuel use from our newly operational hotels, namely Keinnara Loikaw (26 rooms), Hotel Suggati (72 rooms), and Awei Pila 

(24 rooms). The overall GHG emission intensity in FY2019 for the hotels was 4.11 tCO2/room compared to 5.47 tCO2/room in FY2018.

WHAT WE PLAN TO DO

Memories Group has started the monitoring programme for use 

of fuel and electricity across our various business segments to help 

us better understand our environmental footprint. We will also 

continue with our policy of reducing the use of plastic bottles in 

our hotel rooms, boating operations, hot air balloons operations 

and our offices. In doing so, we aim to create awareness for our 

guests and people we work with, on the negative environmental 

impacts of single use plastics, and at the same time, reduce the 

amount of plastic waste generated in our operations.

We will continue to monitor our energy usage and have a better 

understanding of our consumption pattern, energy intensity use 

and to identify areas for improvement.

TARGET FOR FY2020

Collect baseline environmental data (using 2018 - 2020 data) 

before setting a numeric target in FY2021

Reduce the use of plastics and minimise harm to the 

environment

OUR APPROACH

Creating and maintaining our culture of ethics and integrity 

starts with our employees and leaders and extends to our business 

partners and suppliers. Memories Group adopts corporate policies 

including, inter alia, business ethics, code of conduct, conflict 

of interest, environment, health and safety as well as human 

rights policies. The policies are also publicly available under the 

“Corporate Policies” on the Memories Group website.

1. 

foster greater awareness of human rights throughout 

Memories Group including (but not limited to) equal 

opportunity, anti-discrimination, right to life, liberty and 

security of person;

2. 

enhance Memories Group’s capabilities to identify and 

manage adverse impacts from all business activities; and

WHAT WE HAVE DONE

Business ethics (GRI 205-3)

Memories Group has in place a whistle-blowing policy which 

encourages its employees, in confidence, to raise concerns about 

possible corporate improprieties related to matters of financial 

reporting and other matters. Our whistle-blowing policy assures 

employees who make reports in good faith of malpractice or 

impropriety in the workplace will not be dismissed, penalised or 

discriminated against by us as a result of the making of such reports. 

Details of the whistle-blowing policy can be found in our Annual 

Report 2019 Pg.44. The way in which we manage business ethics 

is a crucial part of our growth and expansion. Memories Group 

guards against ethical irregularities in our businesses through the 

adoption and deployment of various procedures. In addition, we 

believe it is our duty and in our longer term interest to support the 

societies in which we work through fair and ethical employment 

and payment of taxes and other fees. Memories Group has a zero-

tolerance approach to bribery and corruption – any team members 

suspected of a crime or malpractice will be investigated. 

In FY2019, we had zero reported incidents of corruption or bribery 

and no business partnerships were terminated or not renewed due 

to corruption. 

We have also adopted a Code of Conduct to regulate the standards 

of ethical conduct for our Directors, officers and employees. They 

are required to observe the Code of Conduct and also maintain 

high standards of integrity in compliance with the laws, regulations 

and our policies. Our ‘Conflict of Interest’ policy assures a high 

level of ethical conduct of persons employed by or involved in the 

governance of Memories Group in all that pertains to Memories 

Group, and to avoid public perceptions and financial consequences 

detrimental to Memories Group that could arise from the misuse, 

or perception of misuse, of an individual’s position or influence.

Compliance with laws and legislation (GRI 419-1)

As of 31 March 2019, there were no significant fines or non-monetary 

sanctions for non-compliance with laws and/or regulations in the 

social, environmental and economic area in Memories Group.

Child labour, human rights

Memories Group has strict human rights policies and we have 

aligned our policies with no forced labour, child labour, slavery or 

human trafficking in our businesses. We ensure that there is a safe 

and secure working environment for all our workers. We do not 

employ children. No breaches have occurred in FY2019, however, if 

a case were reported it would be thoroughly investigated with swift 

and appropriate measures administered to rectify the situation. No 

special programs were run, however, through the contracts that the 

Company has with suppliers, the suppliers are reminded that no 

child labour is to be used and human rights of workers have to be 

respected.

WHAT WE PLAN TO DO

In FY2020, we will continue to review the policies to enhance those 

which are material to our operations. We will continue to deliver 

training on anti-corruption and anti-bribery to all the employees in 

Memories Group.

TARGET FOR FY2020

OUR APPROACH

Memories Group is committed to conserving the culture and 

heritage of the destinations that we operate in while sustaining 

local livelihoods and skills through gainful employment. We support 

responsible travel by connecting guests with cultural and natural 

heritage to create stewardship and resilience. It also helps to boost 

awareness of the tourist site, attraction or area’s significance and 

encourages local residents and visitors to be mindful about their 

impact on the natural and built environment.

WHAT WE HAVE DONE

Identifying “No-Go” activities or sensitive areas which are 

not suitable for tourism

At AHTT / Memories Travel, our excursions are chosen with care, 

and before offering them to tourists, they are evaluated on whether 

they are sustainable and comply with our internal standards. We 

endeavour to minimise any harm done to the environment, heritage, 

animals or social aspects of the destination we bring our tourists 

to. AHTT / Memories Travel is dedicated to Animal Welfare and 

assures that the company only works together with suppliers that 

treat their animals properly. Any signs of negative animal welfare 

will lead to a termination of contract. Guides are also trained on 

correct animal welfare practices and customers educated about 

which excursions to avoid and which items not to purchase.

In FY2019, we had planned for our suppliers providing excursions 

featuring animals to respect ABTA guidelines (Global Animal 

Welfare for Animals in Tourism). Examples of such suppliers we 

work with are Green Hill Valley Elephant Camp, Mae’ Zun Taung 

Star Turtle Conservation near Bagan, and a dolphin conservation 

program with Wildlife Conservation Society in Mandalay.

Our target in FY2019 was also to increase the number of community 

based tour (CBT) operators. Examples of such operators that we 

work with include Magyeekan Village CBT in Salay, Myaing CBT, 

His The’ Village CBT in Mandalay, and Pan Pet Village CBT near 

Loikaw.

As part of our FY2019 target to increase awareness of local artisan 

crafts and traditions, AHTT / Memories Travel has been a partner of 

Doh Eain since 2018, a Yangon based organisation which supports 

heritage restoration and the upgrading of urban spaces. Doh Eain 

provides value to the city and its historical and cultural identity, 

and can also improve people’s livelihoods, support neighbourhoods’ 

socio-economic growth, and contribute to social cohesion, health, 

wellbeing and sustainability.

WHAT WE PLAN TO DO

Awei Pila works closely with the nomadic Moken community 

on Pila Island to utilise their traditional skills where possible. 

The showcasing of local festivals, folk and tribal performing art 

traditions adds heritage value to tourism in Myanmar. In FY2020, 

AHTT / Memories Travel aims to have a 10% increase in the 

number of community-based tour operators, examples of areas 

with such activities include Magyeekan Village in Salay near Bagan, 

and Panpet in Loikaw. At the same time, we also aim to have a 10% 

increase in local artisan crafts in our programmes, examples of such 

activities include painting in a Bagan lacquerware workshop and 

hands-on activities in a wooden pipes workshop in Mawlamyaing. 

With this approach, we are also able to upskill local labour, build 

local capacity and contribute to economic growth in the local 

communities.

OUR APPROACH

Memories Group promotes equal access to employment. We recruit 

and develop individuals solely on the basis of their suitability for 

the job, regardless of gender, age, nationality, religion or disability. 

Hiring, training and retaining the right people, a majority of whom 

are local, is instrumental in shaping the experiences of our guests. 

As our hotels, resorts and experiences are usually located in a 

historical parts of the city and at the heart of a vibrant community, 

we generate value to the surrounding districts and businesses by 

attracting customers, further contributing to the local economy.

Embedding the principles of diversity and inclusion in the way we 

do business gives us a better understanding of the needs of our 

employees, partners, suppliers and customers. A diverse workforce 

and an inclusive environment that respects and nurtures different 

people is a way to improve our business performance. Our diversity 

and inclusion approach focuses on hiring, developing and retaining 

the best. We provide equal opportunity in recruitment, career 

development, promotion, training and rewards for all employees. 

We also hold regular meetings in the communities in which we live 

and work to foster relationships with individuals and companies, 

build connections and expand collaboration.

WHAT WE HAVE DONE

Diversity of workforce and inclusivity (GRI 405-1)

With globalisation and demographic shifts, it is common to find 

employees of different ages, genders, physical abilities, religions, 

ethnicities, nationalities and other characteristics working alongside 

one another. Memories Group believes that by having employees 

from a range of backgrounds work together while respecting one 

another’s values, new concepts and ways of thinking are created 

which lead to greater value for the Company. We currently do not 

have any female representation on our Board, however, 22% of our 

Management (including business functions) is female.

Memories Group’s employees come from many different 

backgrounds and cultures. As of 31 March 2019, we had 635 

employees from 18 countries. To build a diverse team and induce 

a sense of belonging, non-locals employed by Memories Group in 

Myanmar are provided with a comprehensive induction programme 

that includes familiarisation with the local culture and norms. This 

helps the individuals who are new to Myanmar to better understand, 

accept and be comfortable with their local colleagues and the local 

culture.

Our Vision: Employee Satisfaction

We invest in our people to build careers around a shared culture of fairness, diversity, empowerment and recognition.

Employee skills training and development (GRI 404-1, GRI 404-2)

We provide all of our people with ongoing support and training; 

new staff benefit from a comprehensive induction programme. We 

encourage all our employees to set personal development goals as 

part of their yearly performance management plan, which is then 

tracked by their manager and Human Resources. Our frontline 

staff, in particular, those that interact with our customers, are 

provided with English language classes and customer service 

skills to facilitate communication with our customers, who speak 

predominantly English or other European languages. Training in 

Management Skills, Project Management, Basic Fire Fighting Skills 

and First Aid Skills are examples of the training provided to our 

employees.

We have achieved a total of 22,495 hours of training across our 

various business segments in FY2019. As part of Memories Group’s 

FY2019 target, we have achieved the training of at least 50% of our 

managers on the topic of anti-harassment. In FY2019, 66% of our 

managers have participated in the ‘’Respectful Workplace’’ online 

training, and we will continue to roll out this programme to the 

managers in the various business segments in FY2020.

Gender pay, anti-discrimination (GRI 405-2)

At the Memories Group level, the ratio of average remuneration 

for managerial and executive staff is almost equal, with the ratios 

of basic salary of women to men at 1 : 0.8 and 1 : 1 respectively. One 

of Memories Group’s main priorities is to increase recruitment 

of women into management and leadership roles and increase 

retention of senior female leaders.

Employee Engagement

Our employees have continuous face-to-face feedback with their 

supervisors to help drive engagement. This is in addition to the 

monthly group meetings held with the General Manager for that 

business unit. There was no formal employee engagement survey 

done during the last financial year, but a group level engagement 

survey is planned for FY2020. A high level of engagement is 

increasingly important for attracting and retaining talented people 

and, ultimately, for the delivery of business results.

WHAT WE PLAN TO DO

Memories Group has made diversity and inclusion part of our 

corporate strategy and is promoting them in all workplaces. At 

Yoma Strategic*, a Diversity Council comprising representatives 

from different business units and different nationalities of staff 

established in FY2019. Representatives from Memories Group are 

also part of the Diversity Council since its inception.

A Leadership Programme is currently being established by Yoma 

Group. This would also include Memories Group employees. 

Through mentorship with senior management, and working on 

assigned case studies over a six-month period, this Leadership 

Program has the key objective of building future key business 

leaders and 50 staff have been invited to participate in the 

Leadership Programme.

OUR TARGET FOR FY2020

Average number of hours of 

training/employee/year

25 hours per employee per 

year 

Number of managers to 

undergo training on anti-

harassment or how to deal 

with harassments

80% of all managers 

to have received anti-

harassment training

In doing our business, our focus is to offer positive travel experiences 

that benefit customers, communities and the Company. This means 

that while we do our business, we have a responsibility to protect 

the environment and benefit the communities that we work 

with. These communities provide the resources, infrastructure 

and markets that our businesses rely on. It is essential that these 

communities benefit from having us there. We believe we have a 

responsibility to deliver positive, lasting impacts that contribute 

shared and sustained value for all our stakeholders. It is our aim 

to support the development of our communities by leveraging the 

strengths in our operations. We hope that through our community 

partnerships, we can address pressing social needs and reinforce 

our commitment to enduring positive impact. 

In FY2019, we have achieved our target of 2 hours of volunteer 

hours per employee.

WORKING TOGETHER WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES

Awei Pila is a new 24-room eco-friendly beachfront resort which 

started operations in late 2018. It is built on Pila Island, which 

is also inhabited by the Moken ethnic group, which has had a 

seminomadic subsistence gathering and foraging for hundreds of 

years. The Mokens have a few basic huts in one small cove, while 

enterprising Myanmar fishing families and traders have established 

their homes in a nearby bay. Our resort has built a bridge to enable 

cross-village travel during the rainy season, which runs from June 

to September, and plans are underway to build a new monastery for 

the local community. Seafood for restaurants at Awei Pila is also 

purchased locally from the fishermen and other local producers 

who in turn purchase them from the smaller boats. 

Other programs that we have with local communities include:

Amazing Grace social enterprise in Yangon, which brings new 

opportunities to women living with disabilities through jewelry 

and craft production. 15 trainers provide training for the women, 

and flexible employment options bring a regular income to them 

and their families along with increased confidence, self-respect and 

the respect of their communities. The well-designed products are 

sold in a range of shops and social business featuring quality and 

recycled materials such as bottle caps, inner tube, seeds and glass 

beads.

Dhala - Chue Chue Recycling Workshop and Café, sells products 

made from plastic they recycle themselves and are now starting to 

recycle organic waste from the families in the street.

 

MBoutik in Bagan is the business of Myanmar Women Craft 

Producers and a social enterprise initiative of ActionAid.

 

Hla Day in Yangon works together with Myanmar artisans, 

disadvantaged groups and small local businesses to design, develop 

and sell quality handmade products with a contemporary twist. 

They provide a sustainable market place, business, and design 

training to support the livelihoods of our producers, many of whom 

are struggling to overcome disability, exclusion, and poverty. Hla 

Day aims to capture the unique flavors of Myanmar design by locally 

sourcing all materials and celebrating traditional skills enabling 

both customers and artisans to enjoy and benefit from unique and 

quality Myanmar handicrafts. All profits generated are reinvested in 

diverse ways that empower our community of producers.

Pomelo is a Fair Trade marketplace based in Yangon supports social 

businesses throughout Myanmar. Pomelo connects design and 

impact by contributions for each purchase made, while at the same 

time, helping to support unique skills and craftsmanship.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION

From April to September 2018, during the low tourist season, the 

team from Shwe Lay Ta Gun Travel &amp; Tours Company Limited, 

comprising Balloons Over Inle and Balloons Over Bagan actively 

participate in clearing of plastic waste every Friday and Saturday. 

Working with other hotels and restaurants in the area, as well 

as Nyaung Oo football club, banks and tour guides, 45 of our 

employees are deployed each weekend to work with the external 

organisations to clear the plastic waste for recycling. A total of 154 

hours was contributed by the employees over 6 months for this 

activity.

PROVIDING EMERGENCY RELIEF

Nyaung Oo region, which is located in the Mandalay Region, a 

few kilometres from Old Bagan where Balloons Over Bagan has 

their ballooning operations, is a dry zone area. These rural areas 

are highly reliant on rain and collected rainwater in the lakes for 

their daily water usage. During the dry season from February to 

May, the lakes occasionally run dry and villagers have difficulties 

to get access to clean water. During the last dry season in FY2019, 

Shwe Lay Ta Gun donated 52,800 gallons of water to 12 villages 

and 7 Buddhist monasteries using 2,400 gallon tanks loaded on our 

trucks.

In August 2018, Kayin state was affected by a severe monsoon 

resulting in flooding and thousands of villagers were forced to 

move into temporary shelters. Keinnara Hpa-An, which is located 

in Kayin, mobilised 40 employees to assist in the distribution 

of 300 lunch boxes, 20 sacks of rice, 80 bottles of cooking oil to 

monasteries, Shwe Yin Myal Pagoda Camp, Kywat Kyite Village 

High School and Mae Baung Flooding Camp which served as 

temporary shelters and housed approximately 300 affected villagers 

from Hpa-An and the surrounding areas. Keinnara Hpa-An also 

donated 500,000 MMK to the temporary shelters to help provide 

for daily necessities.

OUR TARGET FOR FY2020

We plan to establish a tracking system across Memories 

Group to quantify and monitor the hours of volunteer 

work for each employee, with the aim to achieve 2 hours of 

volunteer work per employee per year in FY2020.
