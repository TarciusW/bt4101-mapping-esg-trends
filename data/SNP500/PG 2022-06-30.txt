Our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products, as well as the creation of new innovative products and brands.  The markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive.  Our products are sold in approximately 180 countries and territories through numerous channels as well as direct-to-consumer.  Our growth strategy is to deliver meaningful and noticeable superiority across five key vectors of our consumer proposition - product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and consumer and customer value.  We use our research and development (R&D) and consumer insights to provide superior products and packaging.  We utilize our marketing and online presence to deliver superior brand messaging to our consumers.  We work collaboratively with our customers to deliver superior retail execution, both in-store and online.  In conjunction with the above vectors, we provide superior value to consumers and our retail customers in each price tier in which we compete.  Productivity improvement is also critical to delivering our objectives of balanced top and bottom-line growth and value creation. Key Product Categories.  Information on key product categories can be found in the MD&A and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Key Customers.  Our customers include mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels.  We also sell direct to consumers.  Sales to Walmart Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 15% of our total sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020.  No other customer represents more than 10% of our total sales.  Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 39% of our total sales in 2022, 39% in 2021 and 38% in 2020.  Sources and Availability of Materials.  Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from third parties, some of whom are single-source suppliers.  We produce certain raw materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process.  In addition, fuel, natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing processes and in the transportation of input materials and finished products.  The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation.  When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass the change to our customers.  The Company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, none of which are material to our business taken as a whole.Trademarks and Patents.  We own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks, which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses.  Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products.  The trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products.  All major trademarks in each business are registered.  In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses.Competitive Condition.  The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive.  Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known global competitors.  In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands.  We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.  We support our products with advertising, promotions and other marketing vehicles to build awareness 2        The Procter & Gamble Companyand trial of our brands and products in conjunction with our sales force.  We believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products.  Product quality, performance, value and packaging are also important differentiating factors.Government Regulation.  Our Company is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across the countries in which we do business.  In the United States, many of our products and manufacturing operations are subject to one or more federal or state regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).  We are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and antitrust and competition laws and regulations that govern our dealings with suppliers, customers, competitors and government officials.  In addition, many foreign jurisdictions in which we do business have regulations and regulatory bodies that govern similar aspects of our operations and products, in some cases to an even more significant degree.  We are also subject to expanding laws and regulations related to environmental protection and other sustainability-related matters, non-financial reporting and diligence, labor and employment, trade, taxation and data privacy and protection, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and similar regulations in states within the United States and in countries around the world.  For additional information on the potential impacts of global legal and regulatory requirements on our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” herein.The Company has in place compliance programs and internal and external experts to help guide our business in complying with these and other existing laws and regulations that apply to us around the globe; and we have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with these laws and regulations.  We also expect that our many suppliers, consultants and other third parties working on our behalf share our commitment to compliance, and we have policies and procedures in place to manage these relationships, though they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over operations and governance.  We do not expect that the Company’s expenditures for compliance with current government regulations, including current environmental regulations, will have a material effect on our total capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in fiscal year 2023 as compared to prior periods.Human Capital.  Our employees are a key source of competitive advantage.  Their actions, guided by our Purpose, Values and Principles (PVPs), are critical to the long-term success of our business.  We aim to retain our talented employees by offering competitive compensation and benefits, strong career development and a respectful and inclusive culture that provides equal opportunity for all. Our Board of Directors, through the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee (C&LD Committee), provides oversight of the Company’s policies and strategies relating to talent including diversity, equality and inclusion as well as the Company’s compensation principles and practices.  The C&LD Committee also evaluates and approves the Company’s compensation plans, policies and programs applicable to our senior executives.EmployeesAs of June 30, 2022, the Company had approximately 106,000 employees, an increase of five percent versus the prior year due primarily to business growth.  The total number of employees is an estimate of total Company employees excluding interns, co-ops, contractors and employees of joint ventures.  49% of our employees are in manufacturing roles and 26% of our employees are located in the United States.  41% of our global employees are women.  As of June 30, 2022, 28% of our U.S. employees identify as multicultural.Training and DevelopmentWe focus on attracting, developing and retaining skilled and diverse talent, both from universities and the broader market.  We recruit from among the best universities across markets in which we compete and are generally able to select from the top talent.  We focus on developing our employees by providing a variety of job experiences, training programs and skill development opportunities.  Given our develop-from-within model for staffing most of our senior leadership positions, it is particularly important for us to ensure holistic growth and full engagement of our employees. Diversity, Equality and InclusionAs a consumer products company, we believe that it is important for our workforce to reflect the diversity of our consumers worldwide.  We also seek to foster an inclusive work environment where each individual can bring their authentic self, which helps drive innovation and enables us to better serve our consumers.  We aspire to achieve equal gender representation globally and at key management and leadership levels.  Within the U.S. workforce, our aspiration is to achieve 40% multicultural representation overall as well as at management and leadership levels. Compensation and BenefitsOur compensation plans are based on the principles of paying for performance, paying competitively versus peer companies that we compete with for talent and in the marketplace and focusing on long-term success through a combination of short-term and long-term incentive programs.  We also offer competitive benefit programs, including retirement plans and health insurance in line with local country practices with flexibility to accommodate the needs of a diverse workforce.Sustainability.  Environmental sustainability is a key focus area and integrated into P&G’s business strategies.  The Company has declared its focus on developing irresistibly superior products and packages that are sustainable.  The Company announced an ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, purchase renewable electricity for our operations, reduce our use of virgin petroleum-based plastic in our packaging, increase the recyclability or reusability of our packaging and increase responsible sourcing of key forest-based commodities such as wood pulp and palm oil. The Procter & Gamble Company        3Additional detailed information on our sustainability efforts including our TCFD (Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures), SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) and CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) reports can be found on our website at https://pginvestor.com/esg.  References to our sustainability reports and website are for informational purposes only and neither the sustainability reports nor the other information on our website is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Item 1A.  Risk Factors. We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-K, as well as in our quarterly and annual reports, current reports on Form 8-K, press releases and other written and oral communications.  All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete.  We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors, except to the extent required by law.  Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations.The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.  This information should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes incorporated in this report.  The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations.  These and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends, perhaps materially. MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND RELATED FINANCIAL RISKSOur business is subject to numerous risks as a result of having significant operations and sales in international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility.We are a global company, with operations in approximately 70 countries and products sold in approximately 180 countries and territories around the world.  We hold assets, incur liabilities, generate sales and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and our operations outside the U.S. generate more than fifty percent of our annual net sales.  Fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies have and could continue to reduce the U.S. dollar value of sales, earnings and cash flows we receive from non-U.S. markets, increase our supply costs (as measured in U.S. dollars) in those markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition.  Further, we have a significant amount of foreign currency debt and derivatives as part of our capital markets activities.  The maturity cash outflows of these instruments could be adversely impacted by significant appreciation of foreign currency exchange rates (particularly the Euro), which could adversely impact our overall cash flows.  Moreover, discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries, including changes to tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, could adversely affect our results.  See also the Results of Operations and Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity sections of the MD&A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. We also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of countries with currency exchange, import authorization, pricing or other controls or restrictions, such as Nigeria, Turkey, Argentina and Egypt.  Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions, continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas, or if new or increased tariffs, quotas, exchange or price controls, trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business.Additionally, our business, operations or employees have been and could continue to be adversely affected (including by the need to de-consolidate or even exit certain businesses in particular countries) by political volatility, labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions, including political instability or upheaval or acts of war (such as the Russia-Ukraine War) and the related government and other entity responses, broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of local governments, particularly in emerging markets.Uncertain economic or social conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship, which could adversely impact our business.Our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local, regional or global economic or social disruptions.  These disruptions have included and may in the future include: a slow-down, recession or inflationary pressures in the general economy; reduced market growth rates; tighter credit markets for our suppliers, vendors or customers; a significant shift in government policies; significant social unrest; the deterioration of economic relations between countries or regions, including potential negative consumer sentiment toward non-local products or sources; or the inability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers.  Additionally, these and other economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third-party partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.  4        The Procter & Gamble CompanyCustomers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles.  In addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient sales, income and cash flow, it could affect the Company’s ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments.Disruptions in credit markets or to our banking partners or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit or overall liquidity.A disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital.  In addition, we rely on top-tier banking partners in key markets around the world, who themselves face economic, societal, political and other risks, for access to credit and to facilitate collection, payment and supply chain finance programs.  A disruption to one or more of these top-tier partners could impact our ability to draw on existing credit facilities or otherwise adversely affect our cash flows or the cash flows of our customers and vendors.Changing political conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results.Changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results.  Results of elections, referendums, sanctions or other political processes in certain markets in which our products are manufactured, sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies, laws and regulations may change, including with respect to sanctions, taxes, tariffs, import and export controls and the general movement of goods, services, capital and people between countries and other matters.  The potential implications of such uncertainty, which include, among others, exchange rate fluctuations, new or increased tariffs, trade barriers and market contraction, could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and cash flows.The war between Russia and Ukraine has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business and financial results.The war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted, and the situation it generates may continue to negatively impact, our operations.  Beginning in March 2022, the Company reduced its product portfolio, discontinued new capital investments and suspended media, advertising and promotional activity in Russia.  Future impacts to the Company are difficult to predict due to the high level of uncertainty as to how the overall situation will evolve.  Within Ukraine, there is a possibility of physical damage and destruction of our two manufacturing facilities, our distribution centers or those of our customers.  We may not be able to operate our manufacturing sites and source raw materials from our suppliers or ship finished products to our customers.  Within Russia, we may reduce further or discontinue our operations due to sanctions and export controls and counter-sanctions, monetary, currency or payment controls, restrictions on access to financial institutions, supply and transportation challenges or other circumstances and considerations.  Ultimately, these could result in loss of assets or impairments of our manufacturing plants and fixed assets or write-downs of other operating assets and working capital.  The war between Russia and Ukraine could also amplify or affect the other risk factors set forth in this Part I, Item 1A, including, but not limited to, foreign exchange volatility, disruptions to the financial and credit markets, energy supply and supply chain disruptions, increased risks of an information security or operational technology incident, cost fluctuations and commodity cost increases and increased costs to ensure compliance with global and local laws and regulations.  The occurrence of any of these risks, combined with the increased impact from the war between Russia and Ukraine, could adversely impact our business and financial results. More broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales, earnings and cash flows should the situation worsen, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures, energy and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of Europe. BUSINESS OPERATIONS RISKSOur business results depend on our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain.Our ability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements.  The loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes or controversies, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, discontinuity or disruptions in our internal information and data systems or those of our suppliers, inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials (including water, recycled materials and materials that meet our labor standards), significant changes in trade policy, natural disasters, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change or otherwise, acts of war or terrorism, disease outbreaks or other external factors over which we have no control, have at times interrupted and could, in the future, interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results.Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities (including certain petroleum-derived materials like resins and paper-based The Procter & Gamble Company        5materials like pulp) and raw and packaging materials and the costs of labor, transportation (including trucks and containers), energy, pension and healthcare.  Inflation pressures could also result in increases in these input costs.  Therefore, our business results depend, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share.  Failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows.The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.The consumer products industry is highly competitive.  Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors.  As a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining sales and profit margins.  To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms.  In addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry into certain categories and growth in hard discounter channels.  Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.We sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels.  Our success depends on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets.  Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles.  Our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased offerings of other branded manufacturers, private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption.If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.The Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers.  The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business.  Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success directly depends on the success of our brands.  The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers.  Our results of operations or cash flows could also be negatively impacted if the Company or one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients, negative perceptions of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleum- based materials), lack of recyclability or other environmental impacts, concerns about actual or alleged labor or equality and inclusion practices, privacy lapses or data breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products.  Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company.  If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted, and our results of operations or cash flows could suffer.  Our Company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, equality and inclusion and environmental sustainability.  While the Company has many programs and initiatives to further these goals, our ability to achieve these goals is impacted in part by the actions and efforts of third parties including local and other governmental authorities, suppliers, vendors and customers.  If these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, the Company's reputation and results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted.We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.Due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, for certain functions.  If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party partners operate, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.  Further, failure of these third parties to meet their obligations to the Company or substantial disruptions in the relationships between the 6        The Procter & Gamble CompanyCompany and these third parties could adversely impact our operations and financial results.  Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk.A significant information security or operational technology incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of one or more key information or operations technology systems, networks, hardware, processes and/or associated sites owned or operated by the Company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation.We rely extensively on information and operational technology (IT/OT) systems, networks and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and technologies, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, many of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business.  The various uses of these IT/OT systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to:•ordering and managing materials from suppliers;•converting materials to finished products;•shipping products to customers;•marketing and selling products to consumers;•collecting, transferring, storing and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data, including such data from persons covered by an expanding landscape of privacy and data regulations, such as citizens of the European Union who are covered by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),  residents of California covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), citizens of China covered by the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) and citizens of Brazil covered by the General Personal Data Protection Law (LGPD); •summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting;•managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms;•hosting, processing and sharing, as appropriate, confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information;•collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications;•complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements;•providing data security; and•handling other processes necessary to manage our business.Numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our services, systems, networks and supply chain, as well as to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations.  In addition, because the techniques, tools and tactics used in cyber-attacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack. Our IT/OT databases and systems and our third-party providers’ databases and systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking and other cyber-attacks.  Such attacks may originate from outside parties, hackers, criminal organizations or other threat actors, including nation states.  In addition, insider actors-malicious or otherwise-could cause technical disruptions and/or confidential data leakage.  We cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third-party providers will prevent material breaches, operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our third-party providers’ IT/OT databases or systems.A breach of our data security systems or failure of our IT/OT databases and systems may have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results.  If the IT/OT systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations, or inadvertent disclosure of, lack of integrity of, or loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, including catastrophic events, natural disasters, power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, improper data handling, viruses, phishing attempts, cyber-attacks, malware and ransomware attacks, security breaches, security incidents or employee error or malfeasance, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and be exposed to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action.  If our critical IT systems or back-up systems or those of our third-party vendors are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them.In addition, if a ransomware attack or other cybersecurity incident occurs, either internally or at our third-party technology service providers, we could be prevented from accessing our data or systems, which may cause interruptions or delays in our business operations, cause us to incur remediation costs, subject us to demands to pay a ransom or damage our reputation.  In addition, such events could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, and we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, our employees, customers and suppliers.  Additionally, we could The Procter & Gamble Company        7be exposed to potential liability, litigation, governmental inquiries, investigations or regulatory enforcement actions; and we could be subject to payment of fines or other penalties, legal claims by our suppliers, customers or employees and significant remediation costs.Periodically, we also upgrade our IT/OT systems or adopt new technologies.  If such a new system or technology does not function properly or otherwise exposes us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures, it could affect our ability to order materials, make and ship orders and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues.  The costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.We must successfully manage the demand, supply and operational challenges associated with the effects of a disease outbreak, including epidemics, pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns.Our business may be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease outbreak, epidemic, pandemic or similar widespread public health concern, such as travel restrictions or recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities as a result of the COVID-19 virus, the threat of the virus or the emergence of any variants.  These impacts include, but are not limited to:•Significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions or financial hardship, shifts in demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products, or stockpiling or similar pantry-loading activity.  If prolonged, such impacts can further increase the difficulty of business or operations planning and may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows;•Inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by constrained workforce capacity or the loss or disruption of other essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or other finished product components, transportation, or other manufacturing and distribution capability; •Failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, to meet their obligations to the Company, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may adversely impact our operations;•Periods of disruption that limit the ability to access the financial markets or which increase the cost of liquidity; or•Significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, including quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, or governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale and support of our products, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.Despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts to the Company, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any such outbreak as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects.  In the case of COVID-19, the emergence of variants may continue to occur across regions and countries where we operate, leading to varied government responses and the potential for decreased vaccine effectiveness, resulting in further volatility and disparity in our results and operations across geographies. BUSINESS STRATEGY & ORGANIZATIONAL RISKSOur ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation, evolving digital marketing and selling platforms and changing consumer habits.We are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products.  Achieving our business results depends, in part, on successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes.  The success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends, to obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others and to continue to deliver efficient and effective marketing across evolving media and mobile platforms with dynamic and increasingly more restrictive privacy requirements.  We must also successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors, customers and vendors.  Failure to continually innovate, improve and respond to competitive moves, platform evolution and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.We must successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities.8        The Procter & Gamble CompanyAs a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities.  We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives.  Specifically, our financial results have been, and in the future could be, adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands or dissolution of joint ventures.  Our  results of operations and cash flows have been, and in the future could also be, impacted by acquisitions or joint venture activities, if:  1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 2) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures, including as a result of integration and collaboration challenges, which could also result in an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change, including attracting and retaining key talent as part of our overall succession planning.Our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings, including staffing adjustments and employee departures.  Failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings, while continuing to invest in business growth, could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.  Additionally, successfully executing organizational change, management transitions at leadership levels of the Company and motivation and retention of key employees, is critical to our business success.  Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers and availability of qualified individuals.  Our success depends on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business.  This includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans. LEGAL & REGULATORY RISKSWe must successfully manage compliance with current and expanding laws and regulations, as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the U.S. and abroad.Our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across the countries in which we do business, including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property, product liability, product composition or formulation, packaging content or corporate responsibility after consumer purchase, marketing, antitrust and competition, privacy, data protection, environmental (including increasing focus on the climate, water and waste impacts of consumer packaged goods companies' operations and products), employment, healthcare, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, trade (including tariffs, sanctions and export controls), tax, accounting and financial reporting or other matters.  In addition, increasing governmental and societal attention to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence and disclosure on topics such as climate change, waste production, water usage, human capital, labor and risk oversight, could expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess and report.  These and other rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations as well as increased enforcement actions by various governmental and regulatory agencies, create challenges for the Company, including our compliance and ethics programs, may alter the environment in which we do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.  If we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results.  Additionally, we are currently, and in the future may be, subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, claims, proceedings and requests for information from governmental agencies or private parties, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business.  Failure to successfully manage these new or pending regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Furthermore, if new or pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position.Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results.The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.  Changes in the various tax laws can and do occur.  For example, in December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the U.S. Tax Act).  The changes included in the U.S. Tax Act were broad and complex.  Under the current U.S. presidential administration, comprehensive federal income tax reform has been proposed, including an increase in the U.S. Federal corporate income tax rate, elimination of certain investment incentives and a more than doubling of U.S. residual taxation of non-U.S. earnings.  While these proposals are controversial, likely to change during the legislative process and may prove difficult to enact as proposed in the current closely divided U.S. Congress, their impact could nonetheless be significant.  Additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are subject to potential evolution.  An outgrowth of the original Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project is a project undertaken by the approximately The Procter & Gamble Company        9140 member countries of the expanded Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Inclusive Framework focused on "Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy."  The breadth of this project extends beyond pure digital businesses and, as proposed, would likely impact a large portion of multinational businesses by potentially redefining jurisdictional taxation rights in market countries and establishing a global minimum tax.  Recent pronouncements related to this project suggest an implementation of the proposed 15% global minimum tax in the near to mid-term.  Continued negotiations on important details of this project are ongoing, and ultimate enactment and timing in the EU, US and other jurisdictions remains uncertain.While it is too early to assess the overall impact of these potential changes, as these and other tax laws and related regulations are revised, enacted and implemented, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted.Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities.  While we believe our tax positions will be sustained, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, including maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions such as the fiscal 2017 Beauty Brands transaction with Coty, may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments.None.Item 2.  Properties.In the U.S., we own and operate 23 manufacturing sites located in 17 different states.  In addition, we own and operate 81 manufacturing sites in 35 other countries.  Many of the domestic and international sites manufacture products for multiple businesses.  Beauty products are manufactured at 22 of these locations; Grooming products at 17; Health Care products at 20; Fabric & Home Care products at 38; and Baby, Feminine & Family Care products at 37.  We own our Corporate headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio.  We own or lease our principal regional general offices in Switzerland, Panama, Singapore, China and Dubai.  We own or lease our principal regional shared service centers in Costa Rica, the United Kingdom and the Philippines.  Management believes that the Company's sites are adequate to support the business and that the properties and equipment have been well maintained.Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax.  In addition, SEC regulations require that we disclose certain environmental proceedings arising under Federal, State or local law when a governmental authority is a party and such proceeding involves potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed a certain threshold ($1 million or more).  There are no relevant matters to disclose under this Item for this period.  See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on certain legal proceedings for which there are contingencies.This item should be read in conjunction with the Company's Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A for additional information.Item 4.

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein is included in the section titled "Economic Conditions and Uncertainties" and the section titled "Risk Factors" (Part I, Item 1A) of this Form 10-K.Purpose, Approach and Non-GAAP MeasuresThe purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year.  The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, 14        The Procter & Gamble Companyand should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes.  The MD&A is organized in the following sections:•Overview•Summary of 2022 Results •Economic Conditions and Uncertainties•Results of Operations•Segment Results•Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity•Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates•Other InformationThroughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per share and operating cash flow.  We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), consisting of organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity.  Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons.  Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends.  Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending and transitional tax payments related to the U.S. Tax Act.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding certain one-time items.  We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management.  The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information.  References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates.  All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category.  The Company measures quarter and fiscal year-to-date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period.  Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate and explain drivers of changes in net sales.  Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales.   OVERVIEWProcter & Gamble is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world.  Our products are sold in approximately 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels.  We also sell direct to individual consumers.  We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors.  In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products, as well as retailers' private-label brands.  Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products).  We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.Organizational StructureOur organizational structure is comprised of Sector Business Units (SBUs), Enterprise Markets (EMs), Corporate Functions (CF) and Global Business Services (GBS).Sector Business UnitsThe Company's ten product categories are organized into five SBUs and five reportable segments (under U.S. GAAP): Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric & Home Care; and Baby, Feminine & Family Care.

They have direct profit responsibility for markets representing the large majority of the Company's sales and earnings (referred to as Focus Markets) and are also responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets).  Throughout the MD&A, we reference business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA).

The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class services and solutions that drive value for P&G.Strategic FocusProcter & Gamble aspires to serve the world’s consumers better than our best competitors in every category and in every country in which we compete and, as a result, deliver total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group.  Delivering and sustaining leadership levels of shareholder value creation requires balanced top- and bottom-line growth and strong cash generation.The Company competes in daily-use product categories where performance plays a significant role in the consumer's choice of brands, and therefore, play to P&G's strengths.  Our focused portfolio of businesses consists of ten product categories where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies.Within these categories, our strategic choices are focused on delighting and winning with consumers.  Our consumers are at the center of everything we do.  We win with consumers by delivering irresistible superiority across five key vectors - product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value.  Winning with consumers around the world and against our best competitors requires superior innovation.  Innovation has always been, and continues to be, P&G’s lifeblood.  Superior products delivered with superior execution drive market growth, value creation for retailers and build share growth for P&G.Ongoing productivity improvement is crucial to delivering our balanced top- and bottom-line growth, cash generation and value creation objectives.  Productivity improvement enables investments to strengthen the superiority of our brands via product and packaging innovation, more efficient and effective supply chains, equity and awareness-building brand advertising and other programs and expansion of sales coverage and R&D programs.  Productivity improvements also enable us to mitigate challenging cost environments (including periods of increasing commodity and negative foreign exchange impacts).  Our objective is to drive productivity improvements across all elements of the statement of earnings and balance sheet, including cost of goods sold, marketing and promotional spending,  overhead costs and capital spending. We act with agility and are constructively disrupting our highly competitive industry and the way we do business, including how we innovate, communicate and leverage new technologies, to create more value.We are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through enhanced clarity of roles and responsibilities, accountability and incentive compensation programs.Additionally, within these strategies of superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization, we have declared four focus areas to strengthen our performance going forward.  These are 1) leveraging environmental sustainability as an additional driver of superior performing products and packaging innovations, 2) increasing digital acumen to drive consumer and customer preference, reduce cost and enable rapid and efficient decision making, 3) developing next-level supply chain capabilities to enable flexibility, agility, resilience and  a new level of productivity adapting to a new reality and 4) delivering employee value equation for all gender identities, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent.We believe these strategies are right for the long-term health of the Company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group.The Company expects the delivery of the following long-term growth algorithm will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive, fast-moving consumer goods peer group:•Organic sales growth above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete;•Core earnings per share (EPS) growth of mid-to-high single digits; and•Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater.During periods of significant macroeconomic pressures, we intend to maintain a disciplined approach to investing in our business, which may cause short-term results to deviate from the long-term growth algorithm.

Unfavorable foreign exchange had a negative 2% impact on net sales.  Net sales growth was driven by a high single digit increase in Health Care, mid-single digit increases in Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care and low single digit increases in Beauty and Grooming.  Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, Organic sales increased 7% on a 2% increase in organic volume.  Organic sales increased double digits in Health Care, increased high single digits in Fabric & Home Care, increased mid-single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care and in Grooming and increased low single digits in Beauty. •Operating income decreased $0.2 billion, or 1% versus year ago to $17.8 billion, as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a decrease in operating margin.•Net earnings increased $0.4 billion or 3% versus year ago to $14.8 billion, due to a prior year loss on early debt extinguishment, lower taxes and interest expense in the current year.  Foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings by approximately $274 million. •Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $14.7 billion, an increase of $0.4 billion or 3% versus the prior year primarily due to the increase in net earnings.•Diluted net earnings per share (EPS) increased 6% to $5.81 due to the increase in net earnings, a reduction in shares outstanding and due to the prior year loss on early debt extinguishment.  Net earnings per share increased 3% versus the prior year core net earnings per share due to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in shares outstanding.•Cash flow from operating activities was $16.7 billion.◦    Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures and certain other impacts, was $13.8 billion.◦    Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings, was 93%.ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIESWe discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications.  All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are "forward-looking statements" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete.  We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors, except as required by law.  Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations.  For more information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.Global Economic Conditions.  Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States.  As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations.  Global economic conditions continue to be volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement.  Other macroeconomic factors also remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as greater political unrest or instability in the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe (including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine War), certain Latin American markets, the Hong Kong market in Greater China and the Korean peninsula could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin and consequently reduce our net earnings and cash flows.Changes in Costs.  Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs, other broader inflationary impacts and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp.  Volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs.  Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations, including energy shortages, port congestions, labor constraints and freight container and truck shortages have impacted our costs and could do so in the future.  If we are unable to manage these impacts through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through 18        The Procter & Gamble Companyconsistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Net sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on the consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including     supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization.  If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.Foreign Exchange.  We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In the past three years, a number of foreign currencies have weakened versus the U.S. dollar, leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts.  Certain countries that recently had and are currently experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations include Argentina, Turkey, Brazil and Russia.  These fluctuations have significantly impacted our historical net sales, costs and net earnings and could do so in the future.  Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on the consumption of our products, which would negatively affect our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.Government Policies.  Our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies.  For example, our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under the current work being led by the OECD for the G20 focused on "Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy."  The breadth of the OECD project extends beyond pure digital businesses, and if agreed and enacted by most countries, is likely to impact most large multinational businesses by both redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and broadly establishing a 15% minimum tax on their foreign operations.  Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and climate change matters.  Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Turkey, Argentina and Egypt.  Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.COVID-19 Pandemic.  Because we sell products that are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the pandemic has not had a materially negative impact to our consolidated net sales, net earnings and cash flows. However, the continued evolution of the pandemic may result in economic recessions or a slowdown of economic growth in certain countries or regions.  It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products (due to governmental actions or key material, transportation and labor shortages impacting our ability to produce and ship products) or could impact consumers’ movements and access to our products.  There could also be reduced demand due to consumption decreases and consumer pantry destocking (particularly, in home cleaning, health and hygiene products) as economic activity resumes following slowdowns or relaxation of governmental restrictions.  Net, the uncertainty in the timing and extent of demand volatility, the relaxation and reimplementation of movement restrictions, the timing and impact of potential consumer pantry destocking, the future economic trends due to a resurgence of positive cases and governmental actions in response to the pandemic may result in heightened volatility and negative impacts to net sales, net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the pandemic.While we have been able to broadly maintain our operations, we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets due primarily to the restriction of employee movements, key material and labor shortages and transportation constraints.  We intend to continue to work with our suppliers and government authorities to implement employee safety measures to minimize disruption to the manufacturing and distribution of our products.  The continued evolution of the pandemic and uncertainty with regards to the disruptions caused either by resurgence of positive cases or governmental actions in response to the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain and impact our operations (for example, the closure of a key manufacturing or distribution facility or the inability of a key material or transportation supplier to source and transport materials).The pandemic has not had a material negative impact on the Company’s liquidity position.  We continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs and continue to maintain access to capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term credit ratings.  Russia-Ukraine War.  The war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations in both countries.  Our Ukraine business includes two manufacturing sites.  We have approximately 500 employees including both manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel.  Our operations in Ukraine accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales and net earnings in fiscal 2022.  Additionally, net assets of our Ukraine subsidiary, along The Procter & Gamble Company        19with Ukraine related assets held by other subsidiaries, account for less than 1% of net assets as of June 30, 2022.  Our Russia business includes two manufacturing sites with a net book value of approximately $350 million as of June 30, 2022.  We have approximately 2,400 employees, including both manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel.  In fiscal 2022, our operations in Russia accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net sales and less than 1% of net earnings.  Additionally, net assets of our Russia subsidiaries, along with Russia related assets held by other subsidiaries, account for less than 2% of net assets as of June 30, 2022.  Beginning in March 2022, the Company has reduced its product portfolio, discontinued new capital investments and suspended media, advertising and promotional activity in Russia. Future impacts to the Company are difficult to predict due to the high level of uncertainty as to how the war will evolve, what its duration will be and its ultimate resolution.  Within Ukraine, there is a possibility of physical damage and destruction of our two manufacturing facilities.  We may not be able to operate our manufacturing sites and source raw materials from our suppliers or ship finished products to our customers.  Ultimately, these could result in impairments of our manufacturing plants and fixed assets or write-downs of other operating assets and working capital.Within Russia, we may not be able to continue our reduced operations at current levels due to sanctions and counter-sanctions, monetary, currency or payment controls, restrictions on access to financial institutions and supply and transportation challenges.  Our suppliers, distributors and retail customers are also impacted by the war and their ability to successfully maintain their operations could also impact our operations or negatively impact the sales of our products. More broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales, earnings and cash flows should the situation escalate beyond its current scope, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of Europe.  For additional information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (SG&A), operating margin, other non-operating items, income taxes and net earnings.  The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives, pricing and other activities by competitors), marketing spending, retail executions (both in-store and online) and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as our pricing actions (which can also impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign exchange impacts on sales outside the U.S.For most of our categories, our cost of products sold and SG&A are variable in nature to some extent.  Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs.  The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in North America are generally higher than the Company average for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for example, product or package improvements) and, to a lesser extent, scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature).  The primary components of SG&A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs.  Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies.  While overhead costs are variable to some extent, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems' infrastructures to support business growth.  The main drivers of changes in SG&A as a percentage of net sales are overhead and marketing cost savings, reinvestments (for example, increased advertising), inflation, foreign exchange fluctuations and scale impacts.For a detailed discussion of the fiscal 2021 year-over-year changes, please refer to the MD&A in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.Net SalesNet sales increased 5% to $80.2 billion in fiscal 2022 on a 2% increase in unit volume versus the prior year.  Unfavorable foreign exchange decreased net sales by 2%.  Favorable pricing had a 4% positive impact on net sales.  Mix increased net sales by 1% due to positive geographic mix from the disproportionate growth of the North America region and positive category mix from the disproportionate growth of the Personal Health Care category, both of which have higher than Company-average selling prices.  This was partially offset by the disproportionate growth of the Fabric Care business, which has lower than Company-average selling prices.  Excluding the net impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, organic sales grew 7% on a 2% increase in organic volume.  Net sales increased high single digits in Health Care, increased mid-single digits in Fabric & Home Care and in Baby, Feminine & Family Care and increased low single digits in Beauty and Grooming.On a regional basis, volume increased mid-single digits in North America and Latin America, increased low single digits in Asia Pacific and IMEA.  Volume in Europe was unchanged and decreased mid-single digits in Greater China.20        The Procter & Gamble CompanyOperating CostsComparisons as a percentage of net sales; Years ended June 3020222021Basis Point ChangeGross margin47.4 %51.2 %(380)Selling, general and administrative expense25.2 %27.6 %(240)Operating margin22.2 %23.6 %(140)Earnings before income taxes22.4 %23.1 %(70)Net earnings18.4 %18.9 %(50)Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble18.4 %18.8 %(40) Gross margin decreased 380 basis points to 47.4% of net sales in fiscal 2022.  The decrease in gross margin was due to:•390 basis points of increased commodity costs,•a 130 basis-point decline from unfavorable mix, due primarily to negative product mix resulting from the launch and growth of premium-priced products that are profit-accretive but have lower than Company-average gross margin, and•40 basis points of net manufacturing cost increases, as 60 basis points of increased transportation costs and 20 basis points of product and packaging investments were partially offset by 40 basis points of productivity savings net of inflation and other cost increases.These impacts were partially offset by a 180 basis-point increase due to higher pricing.Total SG&A decreased 4% to $20.2 billion, due to decreased overhead costs, marketing spending and other operating costs.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 240 basis points to 25.2% primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in overhead costs and marketing spending. •Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 120 basis points due primarily to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and, to a lesser extent, due to increased media and production cost savings and decreased media spending.•Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 110 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings.•Other net operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 10 basis points due primarily to gains from the divestiture of a minor business and sale of real estate, partially offset by increased foreign exchange transactional charges.Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 70 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales.Operating margin decreased 140 basis points to 22.2% due to the decrease in gross margin partially offset by the decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales as discussed above.Non-Operating Items•Interest expense was $439 million in fiscal 2022, a decrease of $63 million versus the prior year driven primarily by lower average interest rates on fixed rate debt.•Interest income was $51 million in fiscal 2022, an increase of $6 million versus the prior year.•Other non-operating income increased $484 million to $570 million, due primarily to a prior year loss on early-debt extinguishment and a current year increase in net non-operating benefits on post-retirement benefit plans, partially offset by unrealized gains on equity investments in the prior year and unrealized losses on equity investments in the current year. Income TaxesThe effective tax rate decreased 70 basis points to 17.8% in 2022 due to:•a 45 basis-point decrease from higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (a 200 basis-point benefit in the current year versus a 155 basis-point benefit in the prior year),•a 30 basis-point decrease from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (35 basis-point favorable impact in the current year versus a 5 basis-point favorable impact in the prior year), and•a 15 basis-point decrease from higher current year deductions for foreign-derived intangible income versus prior year.These decreases were partially offset by a 20 basis-point increase due to unfavorable geographic mix impacts of current year earnings.Net EarningsOperating income decreased 1% or $0.2 billion, to $17.8 billion as the increase in net sales was more than fully offset by the decrease in operating margin, both of which are discussed above. Earnings before income taxes increased 2%, or $0.4 billion, to $18.0 billion, as the decrease in operating income was more than fully offset by a prior year loss on early-debt extinguishment and lower interest expense.  Net earnings increased 3%, or $0.4 billion, to $14.8 billion due to the increase in earnings before income taxes and the decrease in the effective income tax rate discussed above.  Foreign The Procter & Gamble Company        21exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $274 million in fiscal 2022 due to a weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar.  This impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $0.4 billion, or 3%, to $14.7 billion. Diluted net EPS increased $0.31, or 6%, to $5.81 due primarily to the increase in net earnings and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in shares outstanding.  Net earnings per share increased 3% versus the prior year core EPS due to the prior year loss on early debt extinguishment.SEGMENT RESULTSSegment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation.  The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs which are reported in our Corporate segment and are included as part of our Corporate segment discussion.

Higher pricing increased net sales by 3%.  Foreign exchange had no impact on net sales.  Unfavorable mix decreased net sales by 1% due to the disproportionate decline of SK-II, which has higher than segment-average selling prices.  Organic sales also increased 2%.  Global market share of the Beauty segment increased 0.1 points. •Hair Care net sales increased low single digits.  A negative impact of a low single digit decrease in volume was more than offset by increased pricing and favorable mix (due to a higher proportion of premium products, which have higher than category-average selling prices).  Organic sales also increased low single digits.  Volume decreased mid-single digits in Greater China (due to pandemic-related lockdowns and market slowdown in traditional retailers where our shares are disproportionately higher versus social commerce) and IMEA (due to competitive activity) and decreased low single digits in Europe (as a result of portfolio reduction in Russia and higher pricing in certain markets) and Asia Pacific (due to competitive activity).  This was offset by a low single digit volume increase in North America (due to acquisitions).  Excluding the impacts of acquisitions, volume was unchanged in North America.  Global market share of the hair care category decreased less than a point.•Skin and Personal Care net sales increased low single digits.  Positive impacts of a low single digit increase in volume and increased pricing were partially offset by negative category mix due to the decline of SK-II brand (which has higher than category-average selling prices).  Organic sales increased low single digits.  Volume increased mid-teens in Latin America (due to innovation) and increased mid-single digits in North America (due to innovation in personal care and acquisitions) and in Greater China (due to innovation and market growth).  Global market share of the skin and personal care category increased half a point.Net earnings decreased 2% to $3.2 billion in fiscal 2022 as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 90 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin.  Net earnings margin decreased due primarily to a reduction in gross margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales.  The gross margin reduction was driven by increased commodity and transportation costs and negative product mix caused by the decline of SK-II (which has higher than 22        The Procter & Gamble Companysegment-average gross margins), partially offset by increased pricing.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased as the positive scale benefit of the net sales increase and increased cost savings in marketing spending were partially offset by an increase in overhead costs.GROOMING($ millions)20222021Change vs. 2021VolumeN/AN/A—%Net sales$6,587$6,4402%Net earnings$1,490$1,4274%% of net sales22.6%22.2%40 bpsGrooming net sales increased 2% to $6.6 billion in fiscal 2022 on unit volume that was unchanged.

Global market share of the Grooming segment increased 1.2 points.•Shave Care net sales increased mid-single digits.  Positive impacts of a low single digit volume increase and increased pricing were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange.  Organic sales increased high single digits.  Volume increased low single digits in North America (due to innovation), Europe (due to innovation and market growth versus the prior year that was negatively impacted by the pandemic), IMEA (due to market growth) and Latin America (due to innovation).  This was partially offset by a high teens decline in Greater China (due to pandemic-related shutdowns and market slowdown in traditional retailers where our shares are disproportionately higher versus social commerce retailers).  Global market share of the shave care category increased nearly half a point.•Appliances net sales decreased mid-single digits.  Negative impacts of a high single digit decline in volume and unfavorable foreign exchange were partially offset by increased pricing (net of increased trade spending) and positive mix (due to a higher proportion of premium shavers and epilators, which have higher than category-average selling prices).  Organic sales decreased low single digits.  Volume declined double digits in Europe, mid-single digits in North America and low single digits in Asia Pacific, all due to market declines versus the prior year that benefited from pandemic-related consumption increases.  Excluding the impact of a divestiture, volume declined high single digits in Europe.  Global market share of the appliances category increased less than a point.Net earnings increased 4% to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2022 due to the increase in net sales and a 40 basis-point increase in net earnings margin.  The net earnings margin increased due to a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin and a higher effective tax rate.  The gross margin decrease was driven by negative product mix (due to the launch and growth of premium-priced, profit-accretive products that have lower than segment-average gross margins) and increased commodity and transportation costs, partially offset by increased pricing and manufacturing cost savings.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due primarily to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase.  The higher effective tax rate was driven by disproportionate growth in North America, which has higher than segment-average tax rates.

Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts decreased net sales by 1%.  Favorable mix increased net sales by 3% due to the disproportionate growth in North America and the Personal Health Care category, both of which have higher than segment-average selling prices.  Higher pricing increased net sales by 3%.  Organic sales increased 10%.  Global market share of the Health Care segment decreased 0.2 points.•Oral Care net sales increased low single digits.  A negative impact of a low single digit volume decrease and unfavorable foreign exchange were more than fully offset by the positive impacts from favorable mix (due to growth in North America and a higher proportion of premium tier products, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices) and increased pricing.  Organic sales increased mid-single digits.  Volume decreased low teens in Greater China (due to slowdown of the power brush market and pandemic-related lockdowns) and mid-single digits in Europe (as a result of supply constraints primarily due to the global chip shortage).  This was partially offset by a double digit increase in Asia Pacific (due to distribution gains and market growth), a mid-single digit increase in IMEA (due to market growth and innovation) and low single digit increases in North America and Latin America (both due to market growth and innovation).  Global market share of the oral care category increased half a point.•Personal Health Care net sales increased high-teens.  This was due primarily to a low teens increase in volume, increased pricing, increased trade spend efficiencies and positive mix (due to the disproportionate growth in North America and respiratory products, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices), partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.  Organic sales increased about 20%.  Volume increased high teens in North America, increased high single digits in Europe (both due to stronger respiratory seasons and innovation) and increased mid-single digits in IMEA (due to innovation, increased marketing spending and distribution gains).  Global market share of the personal health care category increased less than half a point.The Procter & Gamble Company        23Net earnings increased 8% to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2022 due primarily to the increase in net sales.  Net earnings margin decreased slightly as a decrease in gross margin and a higher effective tax rate were mostly offset by a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales.  The decrease in gross margin was driven primarily by increased commodity and transportation costs and other cost increases associated with the global chip shortage, partially offset by increased pricing.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and overhead productivity, partially offset by an increase in media spending.  The higher effective tax rate was driven by disproportionate growth in North America, which has higher than segment-average tax rates.FABRIC & HOME CARE($ millions)20222021Change vs. 2021VolumeN/AN/A3%Net sales$27,556$26,0146%Net earnings$4,386$4,622(5)%% of net sales15.9%17.8%(190) bpsFabric & Home Care net sales increased 6% to $27.6 billion in fiscal 2022 on a 3% increase in unit volume.

Volume decreased 20% in IMEA (due to market contraction and competitive activity) and decreased low single digits in North America (due to market contraction versus a prior year that benefited from pandemic-related consumption increases).  Global market share of the home care category increased more than a point.Net earnings decreased 5% to $4.4 billion in fiscal 2022 as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 190 basis-point reduction in net earnings margin.  Net earnings margin decreased due primarily to a reduction in gross margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales.  The gross margin decrease was primarily driven by an increase in commodity and transportation costs, and unfavorable mix caused by the growth of premium-priced, profit-accretive products that have lower than segment-average gross margins, partially offset by increased pricing.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase and a reduction in marketing spending.BABY, FEMININE & FAMILY CARE($ millions)20222021Change vs. 2021VolumeN/AN/A1%Net sales$19,736$18,8505%Net earnings$3,266$3,629(10)%% of net sales16.5%19.3%(280) bpsBaby, Feminine & Family Care net sales increased 5% to $19.7 billion in fiscal 2022 on a 1% increase in unit volume.

Positive impacts of a low single digit increase in volume (due to increased promotional activity and innovation) and increased pricing were partially offset by increased promotional spending (versus the prior year with low promotional activity due to the pandemic) and unfavorable mix (due to disproportionate growth in the club channel, which have lower than category-average selling prices).  Organic sales also increased low single digits.  North America's share of the family care category increased nearly a point.Net earnings in fiscal 2022 decreased 10% to $3.3 billion as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 280 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin.  Net earnings margin decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross margin, partially offset by lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales.  Gross margin decreased primarily due to an increase in commodity and transportation costs partially offset by increased pricing.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase and reductions in both marketing and overhead costs.CORPORATE($ millions)20222021Change vs. 2021Net sales$744$44169%Net earnings/(loss)$485$(387)N/ACorporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments.  These include but are not limited to incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, gains and losses related to certain divested brands or businesses, impacts from various financing and investing activities and other impacts related to employee benefits, asset impairments and restructuring activities including manufacturing and workforce optimization.  Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used within the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP.  The most notable ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, which adjusts the blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.Corporate net sales increased 69% to $744 million in fiscal 2022 due to an increase in the net sales of the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level.  Corporate net earnings improved by $872 million to $485 million in fiscal 2022 due primarily to the prior year loss on the early debt extinguishment, a current year gain on the divestiture of a minor business, net sales growth, current year tax benefits (primarily higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation) and lower restructuring charges, partially offset by increased commodity costs tied to the aforementioned incidental businesses.Restructuring Program to Deliver Productivity and Cost SavingsThe Company has historically had an ongoing restructuring program with annual spending in the range of $250 to $500 million.  Savings generated from the Company's restructuring program are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment.  In fiscal 2022, the Company incurred before tax restructuring costs within the range of our historical annual ongoing level of $250 to $500 million.Restructuring accruals of $147 million as of June 30, 2022, are classified as current liabilities.  Approximately 65% of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2022 either have been or will be settled with cash.  Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins.CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates.Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures.  Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends.  Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies.  As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities.  The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Cash Flow Analysis($ millions)20222021Net cash provided by operating activities$16,723 $18,371 Net cash provided/(used) by investing activities(4,424)(2,834)Net cash used in financing activities(14,876)(21,531)Adjusted Free Cash Flow13,792 15,809 Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity93 %107 %Operating Cash FlowOperating cash flow was $16.7 billion in 2022, a 9% decrease versus the prior year.  Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets) generated approximately $17.6 billion of operating cash flow.  Working capital and other impacts used $918 million of operating cash flow as summarized below.•An increase in accounts receivable used $694 million of cash primarily due to sales growth.  The number of days The Procter & Gamble Company        25sales outstanding increased approximately 1 day versus prior year.•Higher inventory used $1.2 billion of cash, due to business growth and increased safety stock levels to strengthen supply chain sufficiency amidst business growth and commodity cost increases.  Inventory days on hand increased approximately 1 day primarily due to these same factors.  •Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities generated $1.4 billion of cash.  Accounts payable increased in line with the increase in inventory and, to a lesser extent, the impact of extended payment terms with suppliers (see Extended Payment Terms and Supply Chain Financing below); partially offset by lower marketing spending.  Days payable outstanding increased approximately 1 day versus prior year due to these same factors.•Other net operating assets and liabilities used $406 million of cash primarily driven by the current portion of transitional tax payments due related to the U.S. Tax Act and pension related contributions, partially offset by other impacts.Adjusted Free Cash Flow.  We view adjusted free cash flow as an important non-GAAP measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.  It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act.  Adjusted free cash flow is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation.  Adjusted free cash flow was $13.8 billion in 2022, a decrease of 13% versus the prior year.  The decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in operating cash flows as discussed above.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings was 93% in 2022. Extended Payment Terms and Supply Chain Financing.  Beginning in fiscal 2014, in response to evolving market practices, the Company began a program to negotiate extended payment terms with its suppliers.  At the same time, the Company initiated a Supply Chain Finance program (the "SCF") with a number of global financial institutions (the "SCF Banks").  Under the SCF, qualifying suppliers may elect to sell their receivables from the Company to a SCF Bank.  These participating suppliers negotiate their receivables sales arrangements directly with the respective SCF Bank.  While the Company is not party to those agreements, the SCF Banks allow the participating suppliers to utilize the Company’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs.  This generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own.  The Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable.  Once a qualifying supplier elects to participate in the SCF and reaches an agreement with an SCF Bank, they elect which individual Company invoices they sell to the SCF bank.  However, all the Company’s payments to participating suppliers are paid to the SCF Bank on the invoice due date, regardless of whether the individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the SCF Bank.  The SCF Bank pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any invoices that were not previously sold to the SCF Bank under the SCF.The terms of the Company’s payment obligation are not impacted by a supplier’s participation in the SCF.  Our payment terms with our suppliers for similar services and materials within individual markets are consistent between suppliers that elect to participate in the SCF and those that do not participate.  Accordingly, our average days outstanding are not significantly impacted by the portion of suppliers or related input costs that are included in the SCF.  In addition, the SCF is available to both material suppliers, where the underlying costs are largely included in Cost of goods sold, and to service suppliers, where the underlying costs are largely included in SG&A.  As of June 30, 2022, approximately 3% of our global suppliers have elected to participate in the SCF.  Payments to those suppliers during fiscal year 2022 total approximately $15 billion, which equals approximately 25% of our total Cost of goods sold and SG&A for the year.  For participating suppliers, we believe substantially all of their receivables with the Company are sold to the SCF Banks.  Accordingly, we would expect that at each balance sheet date, a similar proportion of amounts originally due to suppliers would instead be payable to SCF Banks.  All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in the SCF are recorded within Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the amount due to suppliers participating in the SCF and included in Accounts payable were approximately $6 billion and $5 billion, respectively.Although difficult to project due to market and other dynamics, we anticipate incremental cash flow benefits from the extended payment terms with suppliers could increase at a slower rate in fiscal 2023.  Future changes in our suppliers’ financing policies or economic developments, such as changes in interest rates, general market liquidity or the Company’s credit-worthiness relative to participating suppliers, could impact suppliers’ participation in the SCF and/or our ability to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers.  However, any such impacts are difficult to predict.Investing Cash FlowNet investing activities used $4.4 billion of cash in 2022, primarily due to capital spending and acquisitions.  Net investing activities used $2.8 billion in cash in 2021, mainly due to capital spending. Capital Spending.  Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies, were $3.2 billion in 2022 and $2.8 billion in 2021.  Capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points to 3.9% in 2022. 26        The Procter & Gamble CompanyAcquisitions.  Acquisition activity used cash of $1.4 billion in 2022, primarily related to Beauty acquisitions of Farmacy Beauty, Ouai and TULA. Acquisition activity used $34 million in 2021, primarily related to a minor Health Care acquisition. Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales.  Proceeds from asset sales were $110 million in 2022 and $42 million in 2021, primarily from fixed asset sales and minor brand divestitures. Investment Securities.  Investments provided net cash of $3 million in 2022 primarily from the sale of other investments and used cash of $55 million in 2021 primarily from the purchase of investment securities.  Financing Cash FlowNet financing activities consumed $14.9 billion of cash in 2022, mainly due to treasury stock purchases and dividends to shareholders, partially offset by a net debt increase and the impact of proceeds received from stock option exercises.  Net financing activities consumed $21.5 billion in cash in 2021, mainly due to treasury stock purchases, dividends to shareholders and a net debt reduction, partially offset by the impact of stock options. Dividend Payments.  Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments.  Dividends per common share increased 9% to $3.5227 per share in 2022.  Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $8.8 billion in 2022 and $8.3 billion in 2021.  In April 2022, the Board of Directors declared a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.8698 to $0.9133 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) Convertible Class A Preferred Stock.  This is the 66th consecutive year that our dividend has increased.  We have paid a dividend for 132 consecutive years, every year since our incorporation in 1890.Long-Term and Short-Term Debt.  We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital.  Total debt was $31.5 billion as of June 30, 2022, and $32.0 billion as of June 30, 2021.  We generated $1.9 billion from net debt increases, primarily due to issuance of bonds.  In 2021, we used $3.9 billion for net debt reductions, including $512 million for early debt extinguishment costs related to the early retirement of $2.3 billion of debt.Treasury Purchases.  Total share repurchases were $10.0 billion in 2022 and $11.0 billion in 2021. Impact of Stock Options and Other.  The exercise of stock options and other financing activities generated $2.0 billion and $1.6 billion of cash in 2022 and 2021, respectively. LiquidityAt June 30, 2022, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $11.4 billion, largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program.  We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations.  The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs.  As of June 30, 2022, the Company had $5.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents related to foreign subsidiaries, primarily in various Western European and Asian countries.  We did not have material cash and cash equivalents related to any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds.  Under current law, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future.  We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases.  We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled, and should continue to enable, us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets.  In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient funding to meet short-term financing requirements.On June 30, 2022, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard & Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard & Poor's), all with a stable outlook.We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program.  The current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2 billion five-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in November 2026 and November 2022, respectively.  Both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement.  These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn.  These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing.  In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities.  For additional details on debt, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.The Procter & Gamble Company        27Contractual CommitmentsThe following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2022.($ millions)TotalLess Than 1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsAfter 5 YearsRECORDED LIABILITIESTotal debt$31,925 $8,656 $4,190 $6,508 $12,571 Leases885 206 314 156 209 U.S. Tax Act transitional charge (1)1,886 225 983 678 — OTHERInterest payments relating to long-term debt4,8135689888682,389Minimum pension funding (2)493 160 333 — — Purchase obligations (3)2,7851,082826452425TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS$42,787 $10,897 $7,634 $8,662 $15,594 (1)Represents the U.S. federal tax liability associated with the repatriation provisions of the U.S. Tax Act.

Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements.  The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2025 are not currently determinable.(3)    Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business.  Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent minimum commitments with suppliers and are in line with expected usage.  This includes service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced.  While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity.  In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment.  The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements.  Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends.  We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application.  These include revenue recognition, income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets.  We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.Revenue RecognitionOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers.  Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer.  Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional activities and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers.  Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale.  Amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation, based on contractual terms, sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption rates.  The actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates.  These differences, which have historically not been significant, are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period.  Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes.  Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgements and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions.Realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes.  Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments.  In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority.  These interpretational differences with the respective 28        The Procter & Gamble Companygovernmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.A core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities in the jurisdictions where those functions are performed.  However, because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts, we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various cross-border transactions.  We have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty.  We estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70% of our global earnings.  We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes.  We review these tax uncertainties considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly.  We have several audits in process in various jurisdictions.  Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Because there are several estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.  See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the Company's income taxes.Employee BenefitsWe sponsor various postretirement benefits throughout the world.  These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other postretirement benefit (OPRB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees.  For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPRB plans require assumptions to estimate the net projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates.  These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and net obligations recognized for the underlying plans.  Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations.  As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred.  If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year.  The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPRB plan are partially funded.  The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  For 2022, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPRB assets was 5.5% and 8.4%, respectively.  A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPRB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit/expense by approximately $125 million.Since pension and OPRB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses.  Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPRB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan.  For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better.  The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans of 3.7% represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist.  A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $135 million.  The average discount rate on the OPRB plan of 5.0% reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the U.S., which is where most of the plan participants receive benefits.  A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax OPRB expense by approximately $10 million.  See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPRB plans.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsSignificant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets.  Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units and intangible assets.  The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations.  We typically estimate the fair value of these assets using the income method, which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective assets.  The valuations used to establish and to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin progression, Company business plans and the discount rate applied to cash flows.Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized, but are tested at least annually for impairment.  Our ongoing annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the 3 months ended December 31.  Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of The Procter & Gamble Company        29capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans.  We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.  Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.  For example, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values.  In addition, changes to or a failure to achieve business plans or deterioration of macroeconomic conditions could result in reduced cash flows or higher discount rates, leading to a lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses.We test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value.  Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets.  If the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment.Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment.  Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands.  Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, all customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives.  Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold.  Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives.  An impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed three times their underlying carrying values.  Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high as our legacy businesses.  The Appliances reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value.  Based on our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Shave Care reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 30% and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5%.   The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including residual growth rates) and discount rate.  The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period.  The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates.  The residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share.  As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment.  The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure.  Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar.  Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S.  Another key assumption in our fair value determination of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is the royalty rate, which is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business.  The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins. While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events in the past, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the Shave Care reporting unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.The duration and severity of the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine War could result in a slow-down or a recession or drive inflationary pressures or foreign currency devaluations in the general economy.  These could trigger additional future impairment charges for the Shave Care reporting unit goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.  While we have concluded that a triggering event did not occur during the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk.  Our assessment of the Gillette intangible asset assumes the net sales growth rates will continue to recover from the impact of the pandemic.  There continues to be a high level of uncertainty relating to geopolitical and macroeconomic factors as a result of the Russia-Ukraine War and the COVID-19 pandemic.  Accordingly, there 30        The Procter & Gamble Companycontinues to be risk related to this key assumption.  The continued evolution of the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine War could impact the assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset that are significant enough to trigger an impairment.  Net sales and earnings growth rates could be negatively impacted by more prolonged reductions or changes in demand for our shave care products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, financial hardship, changes in the use and frequency of grooming products or by shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or by disruption in the supply chain or operations due to the evolving Russia-Ukraine War.  In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors including the Russia-Ukraine War could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.  Finally, the discount rate utilized in our valuation model could be impacted by changes in the underlying interest rates and risk premiums included in the determination of the cost of capital.  As of June 30, 2022, the carrying values of the Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were $12.3 billion and $14.1 billion, respectively.  We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset during our annual impairment testing, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter-term and residual growth rates, the discount rate and the royalty rate to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values.  The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates, or a 50 basis point decrease in our royalty rate, some of which would result in an impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. Approximate Percent Change in Estimated Fair Value+25 bps Discount Rate-25 bpsGrowth Rate-50 bps Royalty RateShave Care goodwill reporting unit(6)%(6)%N/AGillette indefinite-lived intangible asset(6)%(6)%(3)%In light of the Russia-Ukraine War, we performed an additional sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset for a range of outcomes, including reduced future cash flows and no future cash flows in Ukraine and Russia.  Under these scenarios, the Shave Care reporting unit fair value continued to exceed its carrying value by approximately 30% and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset’s fair value exceeded or approximated its carrying value.  However, if the impact of the war were to extend beyond its current scope, there could be a triggering event for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset that may cause us to perform an additional impairment assessment for that asset in a future period that may result in an impairment charge.See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing results.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of June 30, 2022.OTHER INFORMATIONHedging and Derivative Financial InstrumentsAs a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices.  We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting.  We leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments.  To the extent we choose to further manage volatility within our financing operations, as discussed below, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices.  See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments.Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling.  The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the RiskManager™ value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level.  The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed.  Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics™ dataset as of June 30, 2022.  In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics™, a reasonable proxy is included.Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period.  In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term.Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments.  Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations.  Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on The Procter & Gamble Company        31our investments in foreign operations.  These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments.Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2022, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements.Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments.  Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates.  Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity.  To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps with maturities of less than 18 months. Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2022, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements.Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments.  We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors.  We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures.As of and during the years ended June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2021, we did not have any financial commodity hedging activity. Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAPIn accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure.  We believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results.  The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes.  These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management.  These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.  These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures, but rather as supplemental information to our business results.  These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted.  These measures include:Organic Sales Growth.  Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of  acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons.  We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis.  This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth:Year ended                             June 30, 2022Net Sales GrowthForeign Exchange ImpactAcquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other (1)Organic Sales GrowthBeauty2 %— %— %2 %Grooming2 %3 %— %5 %Health Care9 %1 %— %10 %Fabric & Home Care6 %2 %— %8 %Baby, Feminine & Family Care5 %1 %— %6 %TOTAL COMPANY5 %2 %— %7 %(1)    Acquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other includes the volume and mix impact of acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. Adjusted Free Cash Flow.  Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and transitional tax payments resulting from the U.S. Tax Act beginning in 2019.  Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion.  We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow ($ millions):OperatingCash FlowCapitalSpendingAdjustments to Operating Cash Flow (1)Adjusted FreeCash Flow2022$16,723 $(3,156)$225 $13,792 2021$18,371 $(2,787)$225 $15,809 (1)    Adjustments to Operating Cash Flow include transitional tax payments resulting from the U.S. Tax Act of $225 in 2022 and 2021.32        The Procter & Gamble CompanyAdjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the charges for early debt extinguishment (which are not considered part of our ongoing operations).  We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes.  This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.  The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent.The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity ($ millions):Adjusted Free Cash FlowNetEarningsEarly Debt Extinguishment ChargesNet Earnings Excluding AdjustmentsAdjusted FreeCash FlowProductivity2022$13,792 $14,793 $— $14,793 93 %2021$15,809 $14,352 $427 $14,779 107 %Core EPS.  Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated.  Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time.  Core EPS is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.  The table below provides a reconciliation of diluted net earnings per share to Core EPS, including the following reconciling items:•Charges for early debt extinguishment:  During fiscal year 2021 the Company recorded after tax charges of $427 million ($512 million before tax), due to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt.  These charges represent the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished.We do not view the above items to be indicative of underlying business results and its exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results.  This item is also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES(Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Reconciliation of Non-GAAP MeasuresTwelve Months Ended June 30, 2022Twelve Months Ended June 30, 2021AS REPORTED (GAAP)AS REPORTED (GAAP)EARLY DEBT EXTINGUISHMENTNON-GAAP (CORE)NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO P&G$14,742 $14,306 $427 $14,733 Core EPSDILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (1)$5.81 $5.50 $0.16 $5.66 (1)  Diluted net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble.CHANGE IN CURRENT YEAR REPORTED (GAAP) VERSUS NON-GAAP (CORE)(1)CORE EPS3 %(1) Change versus year ago is calculated based on As Reported (GAAP) values for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, versus the Non-GAAP (Core) values for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021.Item 7A.

Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.Strong internal controls is an objective that is reinforced through our Worldwide Business Conduct Manual, which sets forth our commitment to conduct business with integrity, and within both the letter and the spirit of the law.  Our people are deeply committed to our Purpose, Values and Principles, which unite us in doing what’s right.  Our system of internal controls includes written policies and procedures, segregation of duties and the careful selection and development of employees.  Additional key elements of our internal control structure include our Global Leadership Council, which is actively involved in oversight of the business strategies, initiatives, results and controls, our Disclosure Committee, which is responsible for evaluating disclosure implications of significant business activities and events, our Board of Directors, which provides strong and effective corporate governance, and our Audit Committee, which reviews significant accounting policies, financial reporting and internal control matters.Global Internal Audit performs audits of internal controls over financial reporting as well as broader financial, operational and compliance audits around the world, provides training and continually improves our internal control processes. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting also includes a robust Control Self-Assessment Program that is conducted annually on critical financial reporting areas of the Company. Management takes the appropriate action to correct any identified control deficiencies. Because of its inherent limitations, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, may not prevent or detect misstatements due to the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden or that misstatements due to error or fraud may occur that are not detected.  Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time.Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, using criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on these criteria.Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, as stated in their report which is included herein./s/ Jon R.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 5, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Intangible Assets — Gillette Indefinite Lived Intangible Asset — Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionThe Company’s evaluation of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each indefinite lived intangible asset to its carrying value. The Company estimates fair value using the income method, which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. This requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future net sales and earnings, including growth rates beyond a 10-year time period, royalty rates, and discount rate. Changes in the assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any impairment charge, or both. The Company performed their annual impairment assessment of the Gillette brand indefinite lived intangible asset (the “Gillette brand”) as of December 31, 2021. Because the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment was recorded. As of June 30, 2022, the carrying value of Gillette indefinite lived intangible asset was $14.1 billion.We identified the Company’s impairment evaluation of the Gillette indefinite lived intangible asset as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset. A high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort was required when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of future net sales and earnings as well as the selection of royalty rates and discount rate, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the AuditOur audit procedures related to forecasts of future net sales and earnings and the selection of the royalty rates and discount rate for the Gillette indefinite lived intangible asset included the following, among others: The Procter & Gamble Company        35•We tested the effectiveness of controls over indefinite lived intangible assets, including those over the determination of fair value, such as controls related to management’s development of forecasts of future net sales and earnings, and the selection of royalty rates and discount rate.•We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast net sales and earnings by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts. •We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecast of net sales and earnings by comparing the forecasts to:•Historical net sales and earnings.•Underlying analysis detailing business strategies and growth plans including consideration of the effects related to the COVID-19 pandemic.•Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors. •Forecasted information included in Company press releases as well as in analyst and industry reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies. •With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the net sales and earnings growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rate by:•Testing the source information underlying the determination of net sales and earnings growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.•Developing a range of independent estimates for the discount rate and comparing the discount rate selected by management to that range./s/ Deloitte & Touche LLPCincinnati, OhioAugust 5, 2022We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1890.36        The Procter & Gamble CompanyREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Procter & Gamble CompanyOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2022, of the Company and our report dated August 5, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Our products are sold in approximately 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels.  We also sell direct to consumers.  We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.Basis of PresentationThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its controlled subsidiaries.  Intercompany transactions are eliminated. Because of a lack of control over Venezuelan subsidiaries caused by a number of currency and other operating controls and restrictions, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not consolidated for any year presented.  We account for those subsidiaries at cost, less impairments, plus or minus observable price changes.Beginning in fiscal year 2022, the Company began to present increases and reductions in short-term debt with maturities of more than three months separately within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  The presentation for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, and June 30, 2020, have been revised to align with the current period presentation.  This change had no impact on total financing activities, and we have concluded the change is not material.Use of EstimatesPreparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures.  These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future.  Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, consumer and trade promotion accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions, postretirement benefits, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax positions and contingencies.  Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates, although management does not generally believe such differences would materially affect the financial statements in any individual year.  However, regarding ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus those anticipated at the time of the initial valuations, could result in impairment charges that materially affect the financial statements in a given year.Revenue RecognitionOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers.  Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer.  A provision for payment discounts and product return allowances is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period the revenue is recognized.  The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities.  The revenue includes shipping and handling costs, which generally are included in the list price to the customer. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers.  Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale.  Most of these arrangements have terms of approximately one year.  Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued marketing and promotion in the Accrued and other liabilities line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Cost of Products SoldCost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacturing of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expenses necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished products.  Cost of products sold also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, internal transfer costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity.Selling, General and Administrative ExpenseSelling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) is primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items.  Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $2.0 billion in 2022, $1.9 billion in 2021 and $1.8 billion in 2020.  Advertising costs, charged to expense as incurred, include worldwide television, print, radio, internet and in-store advertising expenses and were $7.9 billion in 2022, $8.2 billion in 2021 and $7.3 billion in 2020.  Non-advertising related components of the Company's total marketing spending reported in SG&A include costs associated with consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids.Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.The Procter & Gamble Company        43Other Non-Operating Income, NetOther non-operating income, net primarily includes net acquisition and divestiture gains, net non-service impacts related to postretirement benefit plans, investment income and other non-operating items.Currency TranslationFinancial statements of operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency.  Adjustments to translate those statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in Other comprehensive income (OCI).  For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency.  Re-measurement adjustments for financial statements in highly inflationary economies and other transactional exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings.Cash Flow PresentationThe Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are prepared using the indirect method, which reconciles net earnings to cash flows from operating activities.  Cash flows from foreign currency transactions and operations are translated at monthly exchange rates for each period.  Cash flows from hedging activities are included in the same category as the items being hedged.  Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified as financing activities.  Realized gains and losses from non-qualifying derivative instruments used to hedge currency exposures resulting from intercompany financing transactions are also classified as financing activities.  Cash flows from other derivative instruments used to manage interest rates, commodity or other currency exposures are classified as operating activities.  Cash payments related to income taxes are classified as operating activities. InvestmentsThe Company holds minor equity investments in certain companies over which we exert significant influence, but do not control the financial and operating decisions.  These are accounted for as equity method investments.  Other equity investments that are not controlled, and over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, and for which there is a readily determinable market value, are recorded at fair value, with gains and losses recorded through net earnings.  Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured at cost, less impairments, plus or minus observable price changes.  Equity investments are included as Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The Company also holds highly-liquid investments, primarily money market funds and time deposits.  Such investments are considered cash equivalents and are included within Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Inventory ValuationInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Product-related inventories are maintained on the first-in, first-out method.  The cost of spare part inventories is maintained using the average-cost method.Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at cost reduced by accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation expense is recognized over the assets' estimated useful lives using the straight-line method.  Machinery and equipment includes office furniture and fixtures (15-year life), computer equipment and capitalized software (3- to 5-year lives) and manufacturing equipment (3- to 20-year lives).  Buildings are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 40 years.  Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and, when appropriate, changes are made prospectively.  When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present.  Our annual impairment testing of goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. We have acquired brands that have been determined to have indefinite lives.  We evaluate several factors to determine whether an indefinite life is appropriate, including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold.  In addition, when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an additional impairment assessment is performed and indefinite-lived assets may be adjusted to a determinable life.The cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, either on a straight-line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited.  Patents, technology and other intangible assets with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective legal or contractual lives.  Customer relationships, brands and other non-contractual intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over periods generally ranging from 5 to 30 years.  When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and remaining lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted.For additional details on goodwill and intangible assets see Note 4.Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.44        The Procter & Gamble CompanyFair Values of Financial InstrumentsCertain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value.  Changes in assumptions or estimation methods could affect the fair value estimates; however, we do not believe any such changes would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  Other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, certain investments and certain short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.  The fair values of long-term debt and financial instruments are disclosed in Note 9.New Accounting Pronouncements and PoliciesIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting."  In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope."  The amendments were effective upon issuance and provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met.  We have completed our evaluation of significant contracts.  Most contracts reviewed will mature prior to the termination of LIBOR or will be modified to apply a new reference rate, primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) where applicable.  As a result, the guidance has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, "Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance".  This guidance requires annual disclosures for transactions with a government authority that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution model.  These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted.  We plan to adopt the standard for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023.  We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance and do not expect a material impact at this time. No other new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year or in future years had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.NOTE 2SEGMENT INFORMATIONUnder U.S. GAAP, our operating segments are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric & Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine & Family Care.  Our five reportable segments are comprised of:•Beauty:  Hair Care (Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments); Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care);•Grooming:  Shave Care (Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care); Appliances•Health Care:  Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal Health Care  (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Pain Relief, Other Personal Health Care); •Fabric & Home Care:  Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care); and•Baby, Feminine & Family Care:  Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper).While none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal, components within certain reportable segments, such as Appliances (Grooming) and Personal Health Care (Health), are seasonal. The accounting policies of the segments are generally the same as those described in Note 1.  Differences between these policies and U.S. GAAP primarily reflect income taxes, which are reflected in the segments using applicable blended statutory rates.  Adjustments to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in Corporate.  In addition, capital expenditures in the segments are on an accrual basis consistent with the balance sheet.  Adjustments to move from an accrual to cash basis, for purposes of the cash flow statement, are reflected in Corporate.Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities that are not reflected in the operating results used internally to measure and evaluate the businesses, as well as items to adjust management reporting principles to U.S. GAAP.  Operating activities in Corporate include the results of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level.  Operating elements also include certain employee benefit costs, the costs of certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization, asset impairment charges and other general Corporate items.  The non-operating elements in Corporate primarily include interest expense, certain pension and other postretirement benefit costs, certain acquisition and divestiture gains, interest and investing income and other financing costs. Total assets for the reportable segments include those assets managed by the reportable segment, primarily inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets.  Other assets, primarily cash, accounts receivable, investment securities and goodwill, are included in Corporate.Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.The Procter & Gamble Company        45Our operating segments are comprised of similar product categories.

Before tax costs incurred under ongoing programs have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually.  Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs.  Employee separation costs relate to severance packages that are primarily voluntary and the amounts calculated are based on salary levels and past service periods.  Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer.  Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation.  Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or for disposal.  These assets are written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs.  Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period.  These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations.  The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges.  Other restructuring-type charges primarily include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain and overhead optimization.  The Company incurred total restructuring charges of $253 and $330 for the years ended  June 30, 2022 and 2021.  Of the charges incurred for fiscal year 2022, $67 were recorded in SG&A, $182 in Costs of products sold and $4 in Other non-operating income, net.  Of the charges incurred in fiscal year 2021, $176 were recorded in SG&A, $134 in Costs of products sold and $20 in Other non-operating income, net.

We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets.  Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability).  Significant judgement by management is required to estimate the impact of macroeconomic and other factors on future cash flows, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine War.  Estimates utilized in the projected cash flows include consideration of macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion, Company business plans, the underlying product or technology life cycles, economic barriers to entry, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.  Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.  We believe the estimates and assumptions utilized in our impairment testing are reasonable and are comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.  However, actual events and results could differ substantially from those used in our valuations.  To the extent such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows initially used to estimate fair value for purposes of establishing or subsequently impairing the carrying amount of goodwill and related intangible assets, we may need to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future. Goodwill decreased during fiscal 2022 due to currency translation across all reportable segments, partially offset by three acquisitions (Farmacy Beauty, Ouai and TULA) in the Beauty reportable segment. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.48        The Procter & Gamble CompanyGoodwill increased during fiscal 2021 driven by a minor brand acquisition in the Health Care reportable segment and currency translation across all reportable segments.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using the enacted statutory tax rates and are adjusted for any changes in such rates in the period of change. We have elected to account for the tax effects of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) as a current period expense when incurred.

Changes in uncertain tax positions represent changes in our net liability related to prior year tax positions.  Excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options reflect the excess of actual tax benefits received on employee exercises of stock options and other share-based payments (which generally equals the income taxable to the employee) over the amount of tax benefits that were calculated and recognized based on the grant date fair values of such instruments.Tax costs charged to shareholders' equity totaled $1,538 for the year ended June 30, 2022.  This primarily relates to the tax effects of certain adjustments to pension obligations recorded in shareholders' equity and the tax effects of net investment hedges.  Tax costs charged to shareholders' equity totaled $215 for the year ended June 30, 2021.  This primarily relates to the tax effects of certain adjustments to Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.The Procter & Gamble Company        49pension obligations recorded in shareholders' equity, partially offset by the tax effects of net investment hedges.Prior to the passage of the U.S. Tax Act, the Company asserted that substantially all of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely invested and, accordingly, no deferred taxes were provided.  Pursuant to the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, these earnings were subjected to a one-time transition tax.  This charge included taxes for all U.S. income taxes and for the related foreign withholding taxes for the portion of those earnings which are no longer considered indefinitely invested.  We have not provided deferred taxes on approximately $22 billion of earnings that are considered indefinitely invested.A reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability for uncertain tax positions is as follows:Years ended June 30202220212020BEGINNING OF YEAR$627 $485 $466 Increases in tax positions for prior years102 157 60 Decreases in tax positions for prior years(118)(34)(21)Increases in tax positions for current year53 60 82 Settlements with taxing authorities(42)(26)(83)Lapse in statute of limitations(17)(24)(12)Currency translation(22)9 (7)END OF YEAR$583 $627 $485 Included in the total liability for uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2022, is $363 that, depending on the ultimate resolution, could impact the effective tax rate in future periods.The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40-50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion.  We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable.  Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and the closing of statutes of limitation.  Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate.  We have tax years open ranging from 2010 and forward.  We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit.  Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12-month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of approximately $12, including interest and penalties.We recognize the additional accrual of any possible related interest and penalties relating to the underlying uncertain tax position in income tax expense.  As of June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we had accrued interest of $179, $166 and $141 and accrued penalties of $12, $10 and $17, respectively, which are not included in the above table.  During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $21, $38 and $39 in interest expense and $2, $6 and $1 in penalties expense, respectively.Deferred income tax assets and liabilities were comprised of the following: As of June 3020222021DEFERRED TAX ASSETSLoss and other carryforwards914 1,030 Pension and other retiree benefits$740 $1,476 Capitalized research & development646 358 Accrued marketing and promotion420 424 Stock-based compensation386 386 Fixed assets209 223 Lease liabilities185 196 Unrealized loss on financial and foreign exchange transactions138 109 Advance payments82 — Inventory41 31 Accrued interest and taxes22 22 Other717 878 Valuation allowances(409)(569)TOTAL$4,091 $4,564 DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIESGoodwill and intangible assets$5,783 $5,761 Fixed assets1,542 1,512 Other retiree benefits1,031 645 Unrealized gain on financial and foreign exchange transactions439 111 Lease right-of-use assets179 191 Foreign withholding tax on earnings to be repatriated70 108 Other244 175 TOTAL$9,288 $8,503  Net operating loss carryforwards were $2.5 billion at June 30, 2022, and $3.0 billion at June 30, 2021.

Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.  The diluted shares include the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards based on the treasury stock method (see Note 7) and the assumed conversion of preferred stock (see Note 8).Net earnings per share were calculated as follows:Years ended June 30202220212020CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTSNet earnings$14,793 $14,352 $13,103 Less:  Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests51 46 76 Net earnings attributable to P&G14,742 14,306 13,027 Less:  Preferred dividends281 271 263 Net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic)$14,461 $14,035 $12,764 Net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Diluted)$14,742 $14,306 $13,027 SHARES IN MILLIONSBasic weighted average common shares outstanding2,410.32,465.82,487.1Add effect of dilutive securities:Stock options and other unvested equity awards (1)49.552.552.7Convertible preferred shares (2)79.382.786.0Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding2,539.12,601.02,625.8NET EARNINGS PER SHARE (3)Basic$6.00 $5.69 $5.13 Diluted$5.81 $5.50 $4.96 (1)Excludes 11 million, 9 million and 6 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of weighted average stock options outstanding because the exercise price of these options was greater than the average market value of the Company's stock or their effect was antidilutive.(2)An overview of preferred shares can be found in Note 8.  (3)Net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble.  NOTE 7STOCK-BASED COMPENSATIONThe Company has two primary stock-based compensation programs under which we annually grant stock option, restricted stock unit (RSU) and performance stock unit (PSU) awards to key managers and directors. In our main long-term incentive program, key managers can elect to receive options or RSUs.  All options vest after three years and have a 10-year life.  Exercise prices on options are set equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of the grant.  RSUs vest and settle in shares of common stock three years from the grant date.  Senior-level executives participate in an additional long-term incentive program that awards PSUs, which are paid in shares after the end of a three-year performance period subject to pre-established performance goals.  The program includes a Relative Total Shareholder Return (R-TSR) modifier under which the number of shares ultimately granted is also impacted by the Company's actual shareholder return relative to our consumer products competitive peer set.In addition to these long-term incentive programs, we award RSUs to the Company's non-employee directors and make other minor stock option and RSU grants to employees for which the terms are not substantially different from our long-term incentive awards.A total of 150 million shares of common stock were newly authorized for issuance under the stock-based compensation plan approved by shareholders in 2019.  A total of 119 million shares remain available for grant under the 2019 plan.The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards at the date of grant.  The fair value is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are recognized as compensation expense from the grant date through the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.The Procter & Gamble Company        51and/or is no longer required to provide services to earn the award.  Stock-based compensation expense is included as part of Cost of products sold and SG&A in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and includes an estimate of forfeitures, which is based on historical data.

Expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatilities of call options on our stock.  We use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination patterns within the valuation model.  The expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.  The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.A summary of options outstanding under the plans as of June 30, 2022, and activity during the year then ended is presented below:OptionsOptions (in thousands)Weighted Average Exercise PriceWeighted Average Contract-ual Life in YearsAggregate Intrinsic ValueOutstanding at July 1, 2021138,272 $91.24 Granted14,369 141.67 Exercised(25,040)77.07 Forfeited/expired(886)116.38 Outstanding at June 30, 2022126,715 $99.59 5.4$5,618 Exercisable86,992 $84.89 4.0$5,124  The following table provides additional information on stock options:Years ended June 30202220212020Weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted$21.55 $20.94 $15.60 Intrinsic value of options exercised1,886 1,401 1,455 Grant-date fair value of options that vested177 236 217 Cash received from options exercised1,930 1,705 2,019 Actual tax benefit from options exercised399 292 298  At June 30, 2022, $166 of compensation cost had not yet been recognized related to stock option grants.

However, we have historically made adequate discretionary purchases, based on cash availability, market trends and other factors, to offset the impacts of such activity.NOTE 8POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANWe offer various postretirement benefits to our employees.Defined Contribution Retirement PlansWe have defined contribution plans, which cover the majority of our U.S. employees, as well as employees in certain other countries.  These plans are fully funded.  We generally make contributions to participants' accounts based on individual base salaries and years of service.  Total global defined contribution expense was $366, $340 and $317 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.52        The Procter & Gamble CompanyThe primary U.S. defined contribution plan (the U.S. DC plan) comprises the majority of the expense for the Company's defined contribution plans.  For the U.S. DC plan, the contribution rate is set annually.  Total contributions for this plan approximated 14% of total participants' annual wages and salaries in 2022, 2021 and 2020.We maintain The Procter & Gamble Profit Sharing Trust (Trust) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) to provide a portion of the funding for the U.S. DC plan and other retiree benefits (described below).  Operating details of the ESOP are provided at the end of this Note.  The fair value of the ESOP Series A shares allocated to participants reduces our cash contribution required to fund the U.S. DC plan.Defined Benefit Retirement Plans and Other Retiree BenefitsWe offer defined benefit retirement pension plans to certain employees.  These benefits relate primarily to plans outside the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, plans assumed in previous acquisitions covering U.S. employees.We also provide certain other retiree benefits, primarily health care benefits for the majority of our U.S. employees who become eligible for these benefits when they meet minimum age and service requirements.  The plans require cost sharing with retirees and pay a stated percentage of expenses, reduced by deductibles and other coverages.  These benefits are funded by ESOP Series B shares and certain other assets contributed by the Company. Obligation and Funded Status.

We determine our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis.  These assumptions are weighted to reflect each country that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.  The weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, were as follows: (1)Pension BenefitsOther Retiree BenefitsAs of June 302022202120222021Discount rate3.7 % 1.7 % 5.0 % 3.2 %Rate of compensation increase2.8 %2.7 %N/AN/AInterest crediting rate for cash balance plans4.3 %4.4 %N/AN/AHealth care cost trend rates assumed for next yearN/AN/A6.4 %6.4 %Rate to which the health care cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate trend rate)N/AN/A4.5 %4.5 %Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rateN/AN/A20282028(1)Determined as of end of fiscal year.Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.The Procter & Gamble Company        55The weighted average assumptions used to determine net benefit cost recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the years ended June 30 were as follows: (1)Pension BenefitsOther Retiree BenefitsYears ended June 30202220212020202220212020Discount rate1.7 %1.5 %1.9 %3.2 %3.1 %3.7 %Expected return on plan assets5.5 %6.5 %6.6 %8.4 %8.4 %8.4 %Rate of compensation increase2.7 %2.5 %2.6 %N/AN/AN/AInterest crediting rate for cash balance plans4.4 %4.4 %4.4 %N/AN/AN/A(1)    Determined as of beginning of fiscal year. For plans that make up the majority of our obligation, the Company calculates the benefit obligation and the related impacts on service and interest costs using specific spot rates along the corporate bond yield curve.  For the remaining plans, the Company determines these amounts utilizing a single weighted average discount rate derived from the corporate bond yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. Several factors are considered in developing the estimate for the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets.  For the defined benefit retirement plans, these factors include historical rates of return of broad equity and bond indices and projected long-term rates of return obtained from pension investment consultants.  The expected long-term rates of return for plan assets are 8 - 9% for equities and 3 - 5% for bonds.  For other retiree benefit plans, the expected long-term rate of return reflects that the assets are comprised primarily of Company stock.  The expected rate of return on Company stock is based on the long-term projected return of 8.5% and reflects the historical pattern of returns.Plan Assets.  Our investment objective for defined benefit retirement plan assets is to meet the plans' benefit obligations and to improve plan self-sufficiency for future benefit obligations.  The investment strategies focus on asset class diversification, liquidity to meet benefit payments and an appropriate balance of long-term investment return and risk.  Target ranges for asset allocations are determined by assessing different investment risks and matching the actuarial projections of the plans' future liabilities and benefit payments with current as well as expected long-term rates of return on the assets, taking into account investment return volatility and correlations across asset classes.  Plan assets are diversified across several investment managers and are generally invested in liquid funds that are selected to track broad market equity and bond indices.  Investment risk is carefully controlled with plan assets rebalanced to target allocations on a periodic basis and with continual monitoring of investment managers' performance relative to the investment guidelines established with each investment manager.  Our target asset allocation for the year ended June 30, 2022, and actual asset allocation by asset category as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, were as follows:Target Asset AllocationActual Asset Allocation at June 30Pension BenefitsOther RetireeBenefitsPension BenefitsOther Retiree BenefitsAsset Category2022202120222021Cash— %2 %1 %1 %2 %2 %Debt securities61 %2 %58 %59 %1 %2 %Equity securities39 %96 %41 %40 %97 %96 %TOTAL100 %100 %100 %100 %100 %100 % Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.56        The Procter & Gamble CompanyThe following table sets forth the fair value of the Company's plan assets as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy (refer to Note 9 for further discussion on the fair value hierarchy and fair value principles).  Investments valued using net asset value as a practical expedient are not valued using the fair value hierarchy, but rather valued using the net asset value reported by the managers of the funds and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions.

The activity for Level 3 assets is not significant for all years presented.(4)Investments valued using net asset value as a practical expedient are primarily equity and fixed income collective funds. Cash Flows.  Management's best estimate of cash requirements and discretionary contributions for the defined benefit retirement plans and other retiree benefit plans for the year ending June 30, 2023, is $244 and $47, respectively.  Expected contributions are dependent on many variables, including the variability of the market value of the plan assets as compared to the benefit obligation and other market or regulatory conditions.  In addition, we take into consideration our business investment opportunities and resulting cash requirements.  Accordingly, actual funding may differ significantly from current estimates.Total benefit payments expected to be paid to participants, which include payments funded from the Company's assets and payments from the plans are as follows:Years ending June 30PensionBenefitsOther RetireeBenefitsEXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS2023$571 $177 2024564 186 2025590 190 2026585 193 2027601 198 2028 - 20323,459 1,076 Employee Stock Ownership PlanWe maintain the ESOP to provide funding for certain employee benefits discussed in the preceding paragraphs.The ESOP borrowed $1.0 billion in 1989 and the proceeds were used to purchase Series A ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion of the U.S. DC plan.  Principal and interest requirements of the borrowing were paid by the Trust from dividends on the preferred shares and from advances provided by the Company.  The original borrowing of $1.0 billion has been repaid in full, and advances from the Company of $15 remain outstanding at June 30, 2022.  Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of the Company's common stock.  The dividend for the current year was equal to the common stock dividend of $3.52 per share.  The liquidation value is $6.82 per share.Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.The Procter & Gamble Company        57In 1991, the ESOP borrowed an additional $1.0 billion.  The proceeds were used to purchase Series B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock to fund a portion of retiree health care benefits.  These shares, net of the ESOP's debt, are considered plan assets of the other retiree benefits plan discussed above.  The original borrowings of $1.0 billion were repaid in 2021.  Debt service requirements were funded by preferred stock dividends, cash contributions and advances provided by the Company, of which $901 are outstanding at June 30, 2022.  Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of the Company's common stock.  The dividend for the current year was equal to the common stock dividend of $3.52 per share.  The liquidation value is $12.96 per share.Our ESOP accounting practices are consistent with current ESOP accounting guidance, including the permissible continuation of certain provisions from prior accounting guidance.  ESOP debt, which was guaranteed by the Company, was recorded as debt with an offset to the Reserve for ESOP debt retirement, which is presented within Shareholders' equity.  Advances to the ESOP by the Company are recorded as an increase in the Reserve for ESOP debt retirement.  Interest incurred on the ESOP debt was recorded as Interest expense.  Dividends on all preferred shares are charged to Retained earnings.The series A and B preferred shares of the ESOP are allocated to employees based on debt service requirements.  The number of preferred shares outstanding at June 30 was as follows:Shares in thousands202220212020Allocated25,901 27,759 29,591 Unallocated1,123 1,769 2,479 TOTAL SERIES A27,024 29,528 32,070 Allocated30,719 29,203 27,894 Unallocated20,120 22,349 24,418 TOTAL SERIES B50,839 51,552 52,312 For purposes of calculating diluted net earnings per common share, the preferred shares held by the ESOP are considered converted from inception.NOTE 9RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSAs a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices.  We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting.  To the extent we choose to manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions that we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices.If the Company elects to do so and if the instrument meets certain specified accounting criteria, management designates derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net investment hedges.  We record derivative instruments at fair value and the accounting for changes in the fair value depends on the intended use of the derivative, the resulting designation and the effectiveness of the instrument in offsetting the risk exposure it is designed to hedge.  We generally have a high degree of effectiveness between the exposure being hedged and the hedging instrument. Credit Risk ManagementWe have counterparty credit guidelines and normally enter into transactions with investment grade financial institutions, to the extent commercially viable.  Counterparty exposures are monitored daily and downgrades in counterparty credit ratings are reviewed on a timely basis.  We have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, material credit losses on our risk management or other financial instruments.Substantially all of the Company's financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting and collateral agreements with counterparties.  If the Company's credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangements.  The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position as of June 30, 2022, was not material.  The Company has not been required to post collateral as a result of these contractual features.Interest Rate Risk ManagementOur policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt.  To manage this risk in a cost-efficient manner, we enter into interest rate swaps whereby we agree to exchange with the counterparty, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional amount.We designate certain interest rate swaps on fixed rate debt that meet specific accounting criteria as fair value hedges.  For fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in earnings. Foreign Currency Risk ManagementWe manufacture and sell our products and finance our operations in a number of countries throughout the world.  As a result, we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.  We leverage the Company’s diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge. In certain cases, we enter into non-qualifying foreign currency contracts to hedge certain balance sheet items subject to revaluation.  The change in fair value of these instruments and the underlying exposure are both immediately recognized in earnings. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.58        The Procter & Gamble CompanyTo manage exchange rate risk related to our intercompany financing, we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps.  The change in fair value of these non-qualifying instruments is immediately recognized in earnings, substantially offsetting the foreign currency mark-to-market impact of the related exposure.  Net Investment HedgingWe hedge certain net investment positions in foreign subsidiaries.  To accomplish this, we either borrow directly in foreign currencies and designate all or a portion of the foreign currency debt as a hedge of the applicable net investment position or we enter into foreign currency swaps that are designated as hedges of net investments.  Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in the Foreign Currency Translation component of OCI and offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged.  The time value component of the net investment hedge currency swaps is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.  Changes in the fair value of the swap, including changes in the fair value of the excluded time value component, are recognized in OCI and offset the value of the underlying net assets.  The time value component is subsequently reported in income on a systematic basis.Commodity Risk Management Certain raw materials used in our products or production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors.  As of and during the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, we did not have any material financial commodity hedging activity.InsuranceWe self-insure for most insurable risks.  However, we purchase insurance for Directors and Officers Liability and certain other coverage where it is required by law or by contract.Fair Value HierarchyAccounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:•Level 1:  Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.•Level 2:  Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.•Level 3:  Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets.When applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets or liabilities during the year. When active market quotes are not available for financial assets and liabilities, we use industry standard valuation models.  Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including credit risk, interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies.  In circumstances where market-based observable inputs are not available, management judgment is used to develop assumptions to estimate fair value.  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair ValueCash equivalents were $6.0 billion and $9.1 billion as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.  Other investments had a fair value of $140 and $192 as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, including equity securities of $113 and $163 as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are presented in Other noncurrent assets.  Investments are measured at fair value and primarily classified as Level 1 and Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  Level 1 are based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets, and Level 2 are based on quoted market prices for similar investments.  There are no material investment balances classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy or using net asset value as a practical expedient.  Unrealized gains/(losses) on equity securities were $(45) and $69 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Other non-operating income, net.  The fair value of long-term debt was $25.7 billion and $28.8 billion as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($3.6 billion as of June 30, 2022 and 2021).  Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value.  All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost, but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes.  We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments.Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.The Procter & Gamble Company        59Disclosures about Financial InstrumentsThe notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, are as follows:Notional AmountFair Value AssetFair Value (Liability)As of June 30202220212022202120222021DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPSInterest rate contracts$4,972 $7,415 $3 $146 $(307)$— DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPSForeign currency interest rate contracts$7,943 $8,484 $561 $89 $(1)$(94)TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS$12,915 $15,899 $564 $235 $(308)$(94)DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTSForeign currency contracts$5,625 $5,060 $6 $20 $(61)$(22)TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE$18,540 $20,959 $570 $255 $(369)$(116) All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets.  All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities.  The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/liability directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation.  The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $4.7 billion and $7.5 billion as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges.  The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $11.2 billion and $12.0 billion as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  The decrease in the notional balance of interest rate contracts was primarily due to the maturity of interest rate swaps that were associated with multiple bonds maturing in the period.All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities are measured at fair value that is derived from observable market data, including interest rate yield curves and foreign exchange rates, and are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  There was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented.  There were no significant assets or liabilities that were re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.60        The Procter & Gamble CompanyBefore tax gains/(losses) on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows:Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in OCI on DerivativesYears ended June 3020222021DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS (1) (2)Foreign currency interest rate contracts$1,033 $(232)(1)    For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the     amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $73 and $60 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.(2)    In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges.

We lease certain real estate, machinery, equipment, vehicles and office equipment for varying periods.  Many of these leases include an option to either renew or terminate the lease.  For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, these options are included within the lease term when it has become reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options.  The incremental borrowing rate utilized to calculate our lease liabilities is based on the information available at commencement date, as most of the leases do not provide an implicit borrowing rate.  Our operating lease agreements do not contain any material guarantees or restrictive covenants.  The Company does not have any material finance leases or sublease activities.  Short-term leases, defined as leases with initial terms of 12 months or less, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Lease expense for such short-term leases is not material.  The most significant assets in our leasing portfolio relate to real estate and vehicles.  For purposes of calculating lease liabilities for such leases, we have combined lease and non-lease components.The components of the Company’s total operating lease cost for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, were as follows:Years ended June 30202220212020Operating lease cost220245271Variable lease cost (1)897576Total lease cost$309 $320 $347 (1)    Includes primarily costs for utilities, common area maintenance, property taxes and other operating costs associated with operating leases that are not included in the lease liability and are recognized in the period in which they are incurred.Supplemental balance sheet and other information related to leases is as follows:As of June 3020222021Operating leases:Right-of-use assets (Other noncurrent assets)$760$808Current lease liabilities (Accrued and other liabilities)205219Noncurrent lease liabilities (Other noncurrent liabilities)595631Total operating lease liabilities$800$850Weighted average remaining lease term:Operating leases6.4 years6.4 yearsWeighted average discount rate:Operating leases3.2 %3.8 %At June 30, 2022, future payments of operating lease liabilities were as follows:Operating LeasesJune 30, 20221 year$206 2 years179 3 years135 4 years92 5 years64 Over 5 years209 Total lease payments885 Less: Interest(85)Present value of lease liabilities $800  Total cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities was $228 and $253 for the years ended June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2021, respectively.  The right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $217 and $163 for the years ended June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2021, respectively.Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.The Procter & Gamble Company        63NOTE 13COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESGuaranteesIn conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, we may provide routine indemnifications (e.g., indemnification for representations and warranties and retention of previously existing environmental, tax and employee liabilities) for which terms range in duration and, in some circumstances, are not explicitly defined.  The maximum obligation under some indemnifications is also not explicitly stated and, as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated.  Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications.  We believe that if we were to incur a loss on any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In certain situations, we guarantee loans for suppliers and customers.  The total amount of guarantees issued under such arrangements is not material. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that have a material impact on our financial statements.  Purchase CommitmentsWe have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment as part of the normal course of business.  Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations are as follows: Years ending June 3020232024202520262027There-afterPurchase obligations$1,082 $494 $332 $259 $193 $425 Such amounts represent minimum commitments under take-or-pay agreements with suppliers and are in line with expected usage.  These amounts include purchase commitments related to service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced to third-party suppliers.  Due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early termination.  We do not expect to incur penalty payments under these provisions that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.LitigationWe are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax.While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices.  Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Moeller and Schulten, to allow their timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.Item 9B.
