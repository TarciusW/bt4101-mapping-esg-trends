longevity

as the Boustead Group maintains the 

longstanding position as Singapore’s oldest 

continuous business – a practical and 

symbolic reflection of longevity.

Even as sustainability reporting takes centre 

stage among the world’s latest corporate 

reporting initiatives, we feel that being 

rooted in the deep heritage of the Boustead 

Group, the term ‘longevity reporting’ is 

more all encompassing and relevant than 

‘sustainability reporting’.

As you read this report, we hope that you  

gain an in-depth understanding of how we 

ensure the longevity of our business and the 

wider ecosystem that we are interconnected 

with. We also share how we strive towards 

what the Boustead Group has achieved 

in longevity over 190 years, and how this 

translates to delivering sustainable value  

and progress to our key stakeholders, along 

with the communities that we reside in  

and our collective home – Planet Earth.  

Our performance, policies and practices  

on material economic, environmental,  

social and governance topics are explained.  

As a responsible corporate citizen, we are 

highly reflective about how our actions ‘ripple 

upon the pond of life’.

Welcome to Boustead Projects Limited’s 

inaugural Longevity Report. As the leading 

industrial real estate solutions provider in 

Singapore, we have demonstrated over  

two decades of pioneership in industrial  

real estate solutions including the  

design-and-build and development of 

advanced eco-sustainable facilities serving 

some of the world’s best corporations. 

Coincidentally, this year, we also witness and 

have the honour to share in the deep heritage 

of the Boustead Group under Boustead 

Singapore Limited, which celebrates 

190 years of progress, truly an unrivalled 

milestone in Singapore’s corporate history

LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS

we have delivered including our global 

headquarters, Edward Boustead Centre.  

In all of this, it is not just about the end results 

but the journey there as well. Coincidentally, 

this year, we also witness the Boustead 

Group – the place where we have our roots 

and draw our heritage – celebrate 190 years 

of progress, truly an unrivalled milestone 

in Singapore’s corporate history as the 

Boustead Group maintains the longstanding 

position as Singapore’s oldest continuous 

business. The Boustead Group engenders 

the true meaning of sustainability, or as 

the Boustead Group prefers to refer to it, 

longevity.

Even as we continue to shape the face of 

business and industrial parks around the 

region, we do so with a commitment to 

being honourable and building a climate 

of fairness, honesty, trust and sincerity, 

not just with our clients but also with key 

stakeholders such as our team, strategic 

partners, suppliers, lenders, shareholders, 

media, governments and communities.  

As we help clients to build their next stage 

of growth, we want all key stakeholders to 

grow and benefit as well, in the healthiest 

way possible and with a minimal ecological 

footprint.

Focusing on our mission, vision, strong 

human-centric corporate values and the 

need to pursue business with a greater 

purpose, will allow us to achieve our long-

term objectives to be adaptable and relevant, 

deliver sustainable value and progress to key 

stakeholders, and make a positive impact 

economically, environmentally and socially 

on the world.

As you read this inaugural report, we hope 

to impart to you an in-depth understanding 

of how we ensure our longevity and 

strive towards what the Boustead Group 

has achieved in longevity, and how this 

translates to delivering sustainable  

value and progress to key stakeholders,  

Dear Fellow Stakeholders,

It gives us great pleasure to present to you 

the inaugural Boustead Projects FY2018 

Longevity Report for the financial year 

ended 31 March 2018.

As a leading industrial real estate solutions 

provider in Singapore, Boustead Projects has 

demonstrated over 20 years of pioneership 

in industrial real estate solutions including 

the design-and-build and development of 

advanced eco-sustainable facilities serving 

clients from all over the world. Our ability 

to serve these clients including some of 

the world’s best corporations, has been 

achieved through not only dedication and 

hard work but also deep collaboration and 

relationships that we have developed with 

key stakeholders regionally. We are great 

believers in building a sustainable future – 

through our designs, processes, products, 

services and solutions, especially the many  

Green Mark Platinum-rated buildings that 

along with the communities that we reside 

in and our collective home – Planet Earth. 

Our performance, policies and practices on 

material economic, environmental, social 

and governance topics are also explained.

We are proud of what we have achieved to 

date but there is always room for growth 

and improvement.

Thank you for entrusting us with the role  

of being a responsible corporate citizen,  

one which we hope to honour for many  

more decades to come. This journey is an  

ultra-triathlon, one which we will continue 

running and hope to have you join, even if 

only for part of the way. Have an enjoyable read.

have a significant impact on our business 

and ability to achieve our long-term 

objectives to be adaptable and relevant, 

deliver sustainable value and progress, 

and make a positive impact economically, 

environmentally and socially on the world. 

The views of both external and internal 

stakeholders are taken into account when 

determining ESG materiality.

To ensure that material ESG topics remain 

up-to-date, we periodically review current 

and emerging megatrends, changes in the 

economic, political, regulatory and ESG 

landscape in the geographic markets and 

industry clusters that we operate in, along 

with the views of key stakeholders. These 

are then integrated into our ESG materiality 

assessment process.

2.2.1 Key Stakeholder Engagement

We define key stakeholders as being  

groups that our business may have a 

significant impact on or vice versa, and  

who have a vested interest in the way that 

we conduct business. After a thorough 

review, nine key stakeholders were 

identified as shown here.

2.2.3 Opportunities &amp; Risks

We are vigilant in ensuring that our 

strategies to enhance stakeholder value are 

well-supported by sound risk management. 

Our material ESG topics present us with 

both opportunities (if we embrace the 

right approaches to managing these ESG 

topics) and risks (if we neglect these ESG 

topics), which are supplemented by our 

robust existing systems and Enterprise Risk 

Management Framework.

In addition, on 1 January 2016, the United 

Nations (“UN”) officially rolled out 17 

Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”) 

of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development. The UN SDGs universally 

apply to all countries with the ultimate aim of 

mobilising all stakeholders – governments, 

civil societies, the private sector and others 

– to collectively contribute to ending poverty, 

fighting inequality and tackling climate change 

through three dimensions of sustainable 

development: economic growth, social 

inclusion and environmental protection.

We have summarised opportunities 

and risks from material ESG topics 

here, including how we can contribute 

to achieving the UN SDGs through our 

business and performance, policies and 

practices in relation to material ESG topics.

INTRODUCTION

OVER TWO DECADES OF PIONEERSHIP

Over Boustead Projects’ two decades of 

pioneership in the design-and-build and 

development of advanced eco-sustainable 

facilities, we have performed our role as 

a trustworthy corporate citizen, building 

business and trust with key stakeholders 

regionally, and delivering sustainable value 

and progress to them. Through our pursuit 

of business with a greater purpose, we have 

generated and distributed tremendous 

economic value and environmental, social 

and governance (“ESG”) benefits to key 

stakeholders including our team, clients, 

strategic partners, suppliers, lenders, 

shareholders, the media, governments 

and communities. Since our establishment 

in 1996, we have registered continuous 

profitability every year which we believe to 

be absolutely necessary if we are to be able 

to maintain our generation of sustainable 

value and progress to key stakeholders, and 

reinvest for long-term success and longevity.

A common consideration in evolving 

our business model, pioneering new 

methodologies and investing in new 

acquisitions, developments and geographic 

markets in the industrial real estate sector 

has been based on assessing whether 

specific business expansions would not only 

provide sustainable profit but also serve 

a greater purpose through the direct and 

indirect benefits shared with as many key 

stakeholders in as many economic and ESG 

facets as possible. We have refrained from 

specific business expansions that could be 

highly profitable but yet are questionable 

on ethical and moral grounds, considered 

exploitative in nature or deemed as short-

term and unsustainable to begin with. 

The long and short of it is that business 

expansions must make good sense and  

instil a sense of good.

In line with this, our team, organisational 

ecosystem, and engineered products and 

services – primarily industrial real estate 

solutions (“solutions”) – have to inherently 

uphold the high honourable conduct 

and quality standards that have been 

associated with the Boustead Group for 

the past 190 years. In addition, we embrace 

transformation or aim to be transformative 

where possible, in order to promptly adapt 

to new megatrends and the prevailing global 

landscape that has emerged over time.

Our pioneering achievements in the industrial 

real estate sector are summarised here.

In FY2018, our business was categorised 

into two key revenue-generating segments: 

Design-and-Build and Leasing. A third 

segment, Strategic Partnerships &amp; 

Investments generated activities which fed 

directly into Design-and-Build and Leasing. 

These segments are shown on page 19 of 

this report.

This section covers how we are pursuing 

business with a greater purpose through 

our integrated industrial real estate 

solutions model, eco-sustainable solutions, 

quality, transformation initiatives and 

generation of economic value, which are 

derived from the combined depth of all 

six capitals – financial, manufactured, 

intellectual, human, social and relationship, 

and natural – and ultimately deliver positive 

net effects for all six capitals.

Our design-and-build business provides turnkey expertise for 

custom-built facilities for multinational corporations and local 

enterprises including:

1. Industrial facilities;

2. Business park and commercial buildings; and

3. Industrial and business parks.

We have constructed and developed more than 3,000,000

advanced industrial facilities leased to a group of reputable 

end-user clients. 

We have established several strategic partnerships 

and platforms to enhance our competitive position and 

geographically expand across Asia. Working with like-minded 

and reputable partners on several fronts has allowed us to  

pool our complementary capabilities and expertise to take  

on larger-scale projects and broaden our offerings to clients, 

while simultaneously reducing commercial and operational 

risks related to a particular geographic market, industry cluster 

or real estate sector.

(“EHS”) track records, and outright market 

leadership in building advanced eco-

sustainable industrial facilities.

Our capabilities are aimed at helping clients to 

achieve highly effective and cost competitive 

solutions that raise efficiency and sustainability. 

Furthermore, our integrated digital delivery 

system brings various development, design 

and building disciplines under one roof 

and eliminates significant additional costs, 

coordination, time and wastage for clients, 

with building information modelling as the 

centrepiece digitalisation technology for 

significantly enhanced productivity. 

Value Creation across Industrial Real Estate Value Chain


21

BOUSTEAD PROJECTS LIMITED LONGEVITY REPORT 2018

One of our key design-and-build offerings is 

value engineering, the systematic design or 

redesign of a custom-built industrial facility 

to ensure that clients enjoy greater or similar 

facility performance, function and quality 

at significantly reduced costs. We eliminate 

potential over-design and over-construction 

that is usually present where multiple 

independent third-parties are involved. 

Through value engineering, we continue to 

unlock value for clients with significant savings 

in cost, coordination, equipment, materials 

and time as compared to conventional 

construction projects. We have changed 

the norms by which custom-built industrial 

facilities are delivered.

Our capabilities now include pioneering the 

introduction of smart building capabilities and 

proven technologies to design-and-build and 

develop advanced eco-sustainable solutions 

in line with Industry 4.0 transformation 

standards and the Singapore Government’s 

Industry Transformation Programme (“ITP”)1, 

which lays out 23 Industry Transformation 

Maps (“ITMs”) under six industry clusters to 

build a Future-Ready Singapore. Our direct 

contributions to the ITP are made within the 

‘Built Environment’ industry cluster, while 

we provide indirect contributions to support 

transformations in other industry clusters 

– essential domestic services, lifestyle, 

manufacturing, modern services, and trade 

and connectivity – through the solutions that 

we provide to the key players within these 

industry clusters.

3.2 ECO-SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS

Our solutions are experiential and extremely 

functional spaces that are designed around 

clients’ key processes and requirements, 

where talented client teams from the world’s 

best corporations are placed in the ideal built 

environment to collaborate and:

• Give birth to new ideas and innovations – 

R&amp;D centres;

• Create solutions and technologies that drive 

the global economy – high-tech engineering 

and manufacturing facilities; and

• Distribute solutions and technologies 

globally – logistics facilities.

To do so, we continue to develop solutions 

that are eco-sustainable, meaning that they 

have a positive ecological impact. ‘Eco-’ based 

on the root word ‘ecological’ is defined as 

‘relating to or concerned with the relation of 

living organisms to one another and to their 

physical surroundings.’2 Our eco-sustainable 

solutions are expected to deliver primary 

benefits to clients, usually economic in nature, 

and secondary benefits to clients and other 

key stakeholders, which transcend economic 

value into ESG benefits, with an overall positive 

bottomline for the entire ecosystem that our 

solutions fit into.

This is extremely important given that the 

United Nations’ Global Status Report 2017 

states that buildings and construction together 

account for 36% of global final energy usage 

and 39% of energy-related carbon dioxide 

emissions when upstream power generation is 

included.3 Furthermore, 83% of energy-related 

carbon dioxide emissions related to buildings 

and construction are generated by the energy 

consumed when completed buildings are in 

use4 or what is referred to as operating energy. 

As such, our eco-sustainable solutions which 

are already directly influencing and reducing 

energy loss, emissions, pollution, and energy 

and water consumption have the potential to 

do so in the future as well during the highest 

emissions period in the multi-decade building 

lifecycle.

The primary and secondary benefits, industry 

diversification and long-term market outlook 

for our solutions are summarised here.

3.2.1 Solutions Supporting Economic 

Activities

Our solutions have been implemented 

to support niche segments of hard 

infrastructure, primarily industrial and 

business parks that form the backbone of 

economic activities in both developed and 

emerging markets. Today, our solutions 

integrate Industry 4.0 transformation 

standards that increasingly support clients 

with smart buildings.

3.2.2 Solutions with Additional ESG 

Benefits – Green Buildings

Outside of the economic value that clients 

receive, our eco-sustainable solutions also 

offer significant secondary benefits in ESG 

facets. With the eco-sustainability practices 

of clients coming under increased scrutiny 

from their own key stakeholders, we have 

been delivering eco-sustainable solutions 

that help them to match their global growth 

strategies with better management of their 

ecological footprints and compliance with 

environmental regulations. Clients who 

embrace our eco-sustainable solutions also 

receive social benefits such as boosting 

and protecting their relationships and 

reputations with their key stakeholders.

Our eco-sustainable solutions have helped 

clients to significantly reduce energy loss, 

emissions, pollution, waste, and energy 

and water consumption throughout the 

multi-decade building lifecycle. Our eco-

sustainable built environment is conducive 

to create a healthy and productive internal 

environment for clients, while reducing 

the ecological impact on the natural 

environment and surrounding communities. 

Reporting to the Singapore Government’s 

Ministry of National Development, the 

Building &amp; Construction Authority (“BCA”) 

is the agency responsible for championing 

the development of an excellent built 

environment for Singapore. In 2009, we 

broke new ground with the delivery of the 

first Green Mark Platinum-rated industrial 

facility in the heavy industry category for a 

Fortune 500 corporation, Applied Materials 

under the BCA’s Green Mark Programme. 

Since then, we have proceeded to become 

the outright market leader in delivering  

Green Mark Platinum-rated industrial 

facilities and also delivered LEED-rated 

industrial facilities under the US Green 

Building Council (“USGBC”)’s internationally-

recognised Leadership in Energy &amp; 

Environmental Design (LEED) Program.  

Our milestones include delivering the 

first Green Mark Platinum-rated industrial 

facilities in the heavy industry, aerospace 

and logistics industry categories, and about 

18% and 33% of all new private sector Green 

Mark Platinum-rated industrial facilities and 

logistics facilities respectively on Business 1 

and Business 2 industrial-zoned land. 5

INTRODUCTION

During FY2018, we added to our Green 

Mark Platinum track record shown here with 

the Boustead Development Partnership’s 

development of our landmark project of  

the year, ALICE @ Mediapolis (“ALICE”), 

the first truly smart building in any business 

park in Singapore. This 11-floor thriving 

ecosystem and future home for info-

communications, media and technology 

multinational corporations, and fast-growing 

ventures, is set in a vibrant green landscape 

and embodies our best design-and-build 

practices and Industry 4.0 transformation 

standards, which have been extensively 

used in ALICE’s development and  

design-and-build phases, and will continue 

throughout ALICE’s entire multi-decade 

building lifecycle.

As the outright market leader in the  

design-and-build of advanced eco-sustainable 

industrial facilities, we are taking our 

commitment further to attain higher Green 

Mark ratings in our role as a developer 

for multi-tenanted developments that we 

intend to own and lease out in Singapore.

to clients how extensive green building 

features can be incorporated into the design 

of all future buildings. Similarly, the same 

path was taken for ALICE, which recently 

attained the Green Mark Platinum. Moving 

forward, we will continue to explore ways to 

further introduce eco-sustainable solutions 

into our leasehold portfolio including the 

introduction of the Green Lease Scheme 

at our multi-tenanted developments in 

Singapore.

In working towards the promotion of  

Green Mark Platinum-rated industrial 

facilities, our focus is on attaining high 

levels of energy efficiency, water efficiency, 

environmental protection, environmental 

quality and other green features. Many of 

the Green Mark Platinum-rated industrial 

facilities delivered by us incorporate  

the eco-sustainable features summarised 

here.

3.3 QUALITY

Quality has always been a defining factor 

in the total client experience. As part of our 

Quality Management System (“QMS”) which 

includes quality assurance and improvement 

programmes, we first embarked on ISO 

9001 certification in 1999 and have had 

a QMS in place ever since. Shortly after 

the end of FY2018 in April 2018, our major 

design-and-build subsidiary in Singapore, 

Boustead Projects E&amp;C Pte Ltd (“BP E&amp;C”) 

received an upgrade to the latest ISO 

9001:2015 standard. Our QMS sets out 

quality management system enablers, 

commitments, targets and responsibilities 

for our team. Our QMS is both externally 

and internally audited, and ensures quality 

management performance at all workplaces 

and project sites under our control on a daily 

basis.

As the delivery of quality is emphasised 

throughout all potential client touch points, 

our solutions are not always the lowest 

priced among competing solutions but 

do consistently deliver high quality client 

experiences and outcomes. Due to positive 

client experiences and outcomes, numerous 

clients have become repeat clients which 

is important in the context where almost all 

client relationships are business-to-business 

arrangements involving a smaller client base 

but larger transactional value as compared to 

what is typically seen in business-to-consumer 

arrangements. The embedding of quality into 

all potential client touch points is extremely 

important since a client team’s project 

journey together with us typically lasts for 

over one year and is made up of thousands 

of interactions between key stakeholders,

especially between our team and clients, 

strategic partners, suppliers, lenders, 

government agencies and regulators, all 

within a single project.

3.3.1 Quality, Domain Expertise &amp;  

Project Track Records as Client  

Pre-Qualifiers

Our clients range from reputable small and 

medium-sized enterprise clients to global 

clients including Forbes Fortune 500, S&amp;P 

500 and Euronext 100 corporations. Given 

the strong brand reputation of our clients 

and potential clients, there are usually more 

stringent expectations on quality, domain 

expertise and project track records since 

our solutions have such a significant impact 

on the achievement of clients’ global growth 

strategies and their own relationships with 

their key stakeholders. Many clients conduct 

financial, quality, EHS and project track 

record reviews on our business and at times, 

those of our suppliers, before pre-qualifying 

and inviting us to submit proposals, bids 

and tenders for potential projects. Once 

we become a pre-qualified main contractor 

to a specific client, we are routinely invited 

to submit proposals, bids and tenders for 

potential projects whenever the specific 

client reviews a potential new investment 

or project in Singapore and sometimes 

regionally.

In addition, BP E&amp;C is approved by the 

BCA for Grade CW01-A1 and General 

Builder Class 1 License6 to execute building 

construction contracts of unlimited value in 

the private and public sectors. This removes 

the limit on the size of contracts that we can 

undertake in Singapore.

3.3.2 Construction Awards &amp; 

Construction Quality Assessment System

We are a regular feature at the BCA Awards, 

an annual awards programme hosted by the 

BCA to recognise the best in building and 

construction practices and projects.

During FY2018 at the BCA Awards 2017 held 

in June 2017, we received a Construction 

Excellence Award (“CEA”) for the Seagate 

Singapore Design Center – The Shugart 

at Fusionopolis, one-north, while BP 

E&amp;C received a BIM Gold Award in the 

Organisation Category. The CEA accords 

recognition to construction projects that 

have demonstrated the highest standards of 

construction excellence in Singapore, while 

the BIM Award (Organisation Category) 

recognises outstanding organisations 

for going the extra mile in BIM and virtual 

design and construction (“VDC”) adoption at 

the organisational level and also recognises 

organisations for their outstanding 

examples of BIM and VDC use in enhancing 

their own productivity. Separately at the 

BCA Awards 2017, a design-and-build 

project, Markono M-Cube received the 

Green Mark Gold for its eco-sustainable 

features.

In FY2018, BP E&amp;C also achieved the 

Singapore Quality Class (“SQC”) certification 

under SPRING Singapore’s Business 

Excellence Framework. SQC recognises 

organisations that have attained robust 

business fundamentals and met standards for 

good business performance based on global 

benchmarks in areas including leadership, 

customers, strategy, people and process, 

knowledge and results.

Shortly after the end of FY2018 at the BCA 

Awards 2018 held in May 2018, we received the 

Green &amp; Gracious Builder Award (Excellent) for 

overall excellent environmental, professional 

and sustainability practices, an upgrade from 

the Green &amp; Gracious Award (Merit) attained 

in 2015. Separately at the BCA Awards 2018, 

ALICE received the Green Mark Platinum for its 

outstanding eco-sustainable features.

To date, we have delivered 66 projects which are 

at least Green Mark-certified. Our construction 

quality and eco-sustainable efforts have been 

recognised with 24 construction quality and 

Green Mark awards at the BCA Awards as 

shown on page 25 of this report.

As a promoter of quality, we are a leader in 

the BCA’s Construction Quality Assessment 

System (“CONQUAS”), which is used to 

measure the quality achieved in a completed 

construction project in Singapore in respect 

of structural, architectural, and mechanical 

&amp; electrical works. CONQUAS is a voluntary 

quality assessment in respect to most private 

sector design-and-build and development 

projects for industrial facilities. 

Shortly after the end of FY2018, a design-

and-build project, ST Omega 2 for Singapore 

Technologies Electronics received a 

CONQUAS score of 91.5%, placing it within the 

all-time top 10 industrial projects list. To date, 

our efforts in construction quality have been 

recognised with seven projects ranked in the 

CONQUAS all-time top 100 industrial projects 

list7, making us the top main contractor on the 

list. Our track record of nine projects on the 

CONQUAS including non-industrial projects is 

shown on page 26 of this report.

3.4 TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVES

With shorter business cycles due to 

disruptive technologies, we need to embrace 

transformation or be transformative 

where possible, in order to adapt to new 

megatrends and the prevailing global 

landscape that emerges over time. In 

general, two new megatrends that are 

having a profound effect on the building, 

construction and real estate industries are 

Industry 4.0 and climate change.

3.4.1 Industry 4.0

According to Boston Consulting Group 

(“BCG”), Industry 4.0 – the fourth industrial 

revolution – is a transformation that makes it 

possible to gather and analyse data across 

machines, enabling faster, more flexible 

and more efficient processes to produce 

higher quality goods at reduced costs. This 

will increase productivity, shift economics, 

foster industrial growth and modify the 

profile of the workforce and ultimately 

change the competitiveness of corporations 

and regions.8 BCG went on to name nine 

technologies that are transforming industrial 

production as shown here. We have overlaid 

our already implemented technologies in six 

of these areas. 

For over two decades, we have been a 

pioneering force in Singapore’s industrial real 

estate sector, demonstrating pioneership 

and transformation in business model and 

activities including design-and-build (1996), 

design-build-and-lease (2003), advanced  

eco-sustainable buildings (2009) and 

integrated digital delivery (2017), among 

others.

INTRODUCTION

As the latest capability in our pioneering 

approach, integrated digital delivery 

(“IDD”) deploys digitalisation and cloud-

based technologies, and transformative 

methodologies like BIM, VDC, and design 

for manufacturing and assembly (“DfMA”). 

During FY2018, these methodologies were 

extensively adopted in ALICE’s design, 

construction, project management and 

delivery, further complemented by our use 

of drones for aerial imaging, site progress 

and surveillance, and eventually ALICE’s 

marketing through the deployment of 

augmented and virtual reality technologies. 

ALICE was constructed virtually using BIM 

and VDC (before the actual construction) so 

that most issues could be anticipated during 

construction, operation and maintenance, 

and proactive solutions could be generated, 

thereby significantly boosting productivity. 

Another first in the industry, ALICE adopted 

large-scale prefabricated bathroom units 

(“PBUs”) using prefabricated, prefinished 

volumetric construction, moving beyond the 

norm of small PBUs in the residential sector.

On the operational side, an ALICE mobile app 

designed as a collaboration between us and 

Habitap – a leading homegrown proptech 

firm – will be driven by big data analytics and 

Internet of Things (“IoT”) for tenant interface 

tied to ALICE’s smart building management 

system. The single and comprehensive 

backend system for operations and facilities 

management will greatly automate processes,

3.4.2 Climate Change

Opening for signatures on 22 April 2016 – 

Earth Day – at the UN Headquarters in New 

York, the Paris Agreement entered into force 

on 4 November 2016 and has been ratified 

by 180 out of 197 parties to the Convention to 

date. The Paris Agreement brings together all 

nations in an extremely important common 

goal to combat climate change and adapt 

to its effects, with the aim of keeping global 

temperature rise this century at well below 2°C 

above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts 

to limit temperature increase even further to 

1.5°C.9  The Singapore Government ratified the 

Paris Agreement on 21 September 2016.

In line with this, we acknowledge that we 

have a shared responsibility as a responsible 

corporate citizen to work towards uplifting our 

business in material ESG topics, especially 

in relation to the building, construction and 

real estate industries. Given the high energy 

intensity and emissions contributed by  

these industries, we aim to promote our  

eco-sustainable solutions as previously 

shown on pages 21 to 23 of this report. As 

explained earlier, we provide eco-sustainable 

solutions that have the potential to directly 

influence and reduce energy loss, emissions, 

pollution, and energy and water consumption 

in some of the most energy-intensive sectors, 

and work towards the extremely important 

common goal to combat climate change and 

protect our environment. More information 

on our performance, policies and processes 

in relation to climate change will be shared in 

subsequent sections of this report.

3.5 FY2018 ECONOMIC VALUE 

GENERATION &amp; DISTRIBUTION   

Our continuous profitability every year 

has enabled us to maintain our generation 

of sustainable value and progress to key 

stakeholders, and reinvest for long-term 

success and longevity.

In FY2018, we created S$202.1 million in 

economic value, which was distributed to key 

stakeholders as shown here.

We have built a fundamentally-sound balance 

sheet, reinvested in business expansions and 

our growing leasehold portfolio and continue 

to have the capability to make new acquisitions 

and investments. Wholly-owned properties 

under our leasehold portfolio contribute 

relatively stable leasing revenue and profit that 

has gradually grown over time and provides 

a base to our financial performance, along 

with complementing our design-and-build 

activities. In the future, we expect jointly-

owned properties under our investments in 

associated companies and joint ventures to 

grow as well and contribute to leasing profit. 

FY2017 was our first complete financial year 

following our listing on the SGX Mainboard 

in April 2015 and also marked our inaugural 

dividend payments to shareholders. In FY2018, 

we made dividend payments to shareholders 

for the second consecutive year. Our five-year 

financial performance summary is shown on

INTRODUCTION

A PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE BUSINESS

An organisation is only as good as its 

people. At Boustead Projects, this is 

absolutely true.

We are a knowledge-based, information-

driven, business-to-business and people-

to-people corporation, where achieving our 

mission, vision and long-term objectives are 

highly dependent on the values, conduct and 

performance of our best asset – our team.

Our team is expected to demonstrate our 

five human-centric corporate values – 

integrity, professionalism, perseverance, 

flexibility and passion – in interactions 

with key stakeholders. Developing a high 

performance team capable of delivering  

our engineered products and services, 

primarily industrial real estate solutions 

(“solutions”) aligned with our fundamental 

principles and strong human-centric 

corporate values, strengthens our trusted 

partnerships with client teams at many 

of the world’s best corporations, helping 

them to build their next stage of growth, 

derive true value from their sizeable 

investments and deliver economic value 

and environmental, social and governance 

(“ESG”) benefits to their own stakeholders, 

while keeping us at the forefront of the 

industrial real estate sector.

A client team’s project journey together 

with us typically lasts for over one year and 

is made up of thousands of interactions 

between key stakeholders, especially 

between our team and clients, strategic 

partners, suppliers, lenders, government 

agencies and regulators, all within a single 

project. As our business ambassadors, 

our team is the first ranking enabler of 

developing strong relationships with key 

stakeholders and the main contributor to 

our long-term success and longevity.  

All systems, policies and processes 

(together “system enablers”) are there 

to support a high performance team 

capable of meeting the expectations of  

key stakeholders.

Being rooted in the deep heritage of the 

Boustead Group, fundamental principles 

have been passed down from generation to 

generation that continue to guide our daily 

actions and decisions today. We believe 

in acting honourably in the way that we 

conduct business and staying true to our 

strong human-centric corporate values. 

We have zero tolerance for accidents, 

bribery, corruption, fraud and violence. 

We do not condone the use of child labour 

or forced labour, whether at project sites 

under our direct control or project sites 

under our subcontractors and suppliers 

(together “suppliers”)’s control. We believe 

in providing our team with fair employment 

and human rights.

This section covers our Code of Conduct, 

Team Development Programme, positive 

work environment and supply chain 

management which are mainly derived 

from the combined depth of three capitals 

– intellectual, human, and social and 

relationship – and ultimately deliver positive 

net effects for all six capitals.

4.1 CODE OF CONDUCT

We are highly committed to building a climate 

of fairness, honesty, trust and sincerity with 

key stakeholders, beginning with our team’s 

honourable conduct. Our Code of Conduct 

(“COC”) sets the foundation for our daily 

actions and decisions, and helps our team to 

adhere to the highest standards of honourable 

conduct.

Our team members are inducted in, updated 

on and expected to adhere to our COC as a 

condition of employment, with orientation 

briefings when new team members join, 

followed by annual acknowledgements and 

reviews of our COC. Policies on anti-bribery 

and anti-corruption (“ABAC”), fair dealing 

and competition, proper use of corporate 

positions and resources, confidentiality 

and privacy obligations, insider trading and 

whistle-blowing are covered in our COC, 

among other guidance areas on honourable 

conduct as shown here.

4.1.1 ABAC

We have zero tolerance for bribery and 

corruption. We expect our team and all third 

parties whom we have business dealings 

with to comply with Singapore’s Prevention 

of Corruption Act (Chapter 241) and all 

applicable ABAC laws and regulations in 

countries where we operate. Our team 

members are bound by our ABAC Policy 

regardless of whether they are employed in 

Singapore, stationed overseas or employed 

outside of Singapore. We may also be 

required to comply with applicable foreign 

ABAC laws and regulations imposed in 

business dealings with multinational clients 

who are headquartered in a foreign country 

where we have no operational presence.

FRAMEWORK

INTRODUCTION

4.1.2 Fair Dealing &amp; Competition

We engage only in fair and vigorous 

competition. We expect our team members 

to fairly deal and interact with fellow team 

members, clients and competitors, and not to 

take unfair advantage of all third parties whom 

we have business dealings with. This includes 

avoiding abuse of confidential or privileged 

information, concealment, illegal conduct, 

manipulation, misrepresentation of material 

facts, undue influence or any other unfair 

dealing practices.

4.1.3 Proper Use of Corporate Positions &amp; 

Resources

We expect our team members to apply and 

use corporate positions and resources in a 

responsible manner, which broadly includes 

duties to act in good faith and in our best 

interests as a whole.

4.1.4 Confidentiality, Data Protection &amp; 

Privacy

Information is a valuable asset, particularly 

in our knowledge-based, information-driven 

business model. In the ordinary course of 

business, we may receive clients’ confidential 

data, in which case we may be subject to 

various non-disclosure agreements and 

confidentiality clauses. Clients expect us  

to abide by confidentiality obligations, 

exposing us to a wide range of risks from  

non-compliance. In addition, we have to 

comply with Singapore’s Personal Data 

Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) that 

requires organisations that collect, use or 

disclose personal data to abide by PDPA 

requirements, again exposing us to a wide 

range of risks from non-compliance.

We are highly committed to adhering 

with all confidentiality obligations, and 

applicable data protection and privacy laws 

and regulations in countries where we 

operate. Our data protection and IT system 

enablers ensure that information assets are 

properly governed, managed and secured 

both in digital and physical environments. 

This allows us to effectively comply with 

confidentiality, data protection and privacy 

obligations over the long-term.

In data protection, we have implemented 

a Data Protection Governance Framework 

(“DPG Framework”) that covers governance 

principles, structure and system enablers. 

We opted for a governance structure with 

centralised formulation of system enablers 

and decentralised implementation of system 

enablers. Our Data Protection Committee 

(“DPC”) comprising our senior management 

team, department heads and key executives 

has overall responsibility for the effective 

implementation of system enablers, while 

appointed Data Protection Officers (“DPOs”) 

direct and coordinate activities. Our DPOs 

also act as the external interface with the 

general public. Other than our DPC and 

DPOs, team members are also briefed and 

trained to understand the PDPA and our 

DPG Framework including any department 

data and information flows that may require 

protection. Policies for IT, information 

security, external data protection, internal 

data protection, document retention and 

third-party outsourcing are covered in our 

DPG Framework and reviewed by our senior 

management team and DPC at least once 

every two years.

During FY2018, we had no substantiated 

complaints on breaches of client privacy. 

Nonetheless, in once instance, we internally 

identified a supplier that was in minor  

non-compliance in end-user client 

confidentiality and promptly notified the 

supplier to remove any references to the 

specific end-user client on their website, 

which was immediately effected.

4.1.5 Insider Trading

We expect our team members with access 

to price-sensitive information to comply 

with Singapore’s Securities &amp; Futures Act 

(Chapter 289), and laws and regulations 

against insider trading. Team members with 

access to price-sensitive information are 

not allowed to trade in Boustead Projects’ 

securities on short-term considerations and 

in the two weeks and one month before 

quarterly and full-year financial results 

announcements respectively, ending only 

after release of relevant announcements. 

Team members are reminded to comply  

with insider trading laws and regulations,  

and trading black-out periods on a  

quarterly basis.

4.1.6 Whistle-Blowing Mechanism

Implemented in 2008, our whistle-blowing 

mechanism allows our team members and 

all third parties to raise and report in good 

faith and in confidence, any concerns about 

possible misconduct in financial reporting 

matters or suspected bribery, corruption, 

fraud and dishonourable conduct. 

Procedures are in place to ensure that 

whistle-blowers are protected.  

More information on our Whistle-Blowing 

Policy is available within the Boustead 

Projects FY2018 Annual Report on page 58.

Violations of our COC will result in 

appropriate disciplinary actions being taken 

against the violating team member including 

potential dismissal and referral to legal 

authorities for serious violations that may be 

illegal. A compliance plan sets forth how our 

COC is to be implemented and monitored 

including how violations are detected, 

reported and investigated, as well as  

follow-up actions to be taken.

4.2 TEAM DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME

The purpose of our Team Development 

Programme (“TDP”) is to attract, develop, 

motivate and retain team members with 

values, attitudes, skillsets and work practices 

aligned with our mission, vision, strong 

human-centric corporate values and high 

performance team culture. Our TDP is 

structured to create a work environment that 

promotes creativity, excitement and growth, 

and make team members feel cared for, 

challenged, empowered and respected.  

Our TDP sets out human resource 

management (“HRM”) system enablers, 

commitments, targets and responsibilities for 

our team, with implementation responsibility 

belonging to our Group Human Resource 

Team (“Group HR Team”) headed by our 

Deputy Director of Human Resources,  

a member of our management team.  

Our Group HR Team provides HRM leadership 

and support to all subsidiaries regionally. 

We have always embraced diversity in 

our team, a trait we inherited from the 

Boustead Group. This diversity has not 

just been in terms of gender balance but 

also in age, race, religion, marital status, 

family responsibilities, work experience and 

nationality, with a multi-cultural and multi-

faceted team mainly from Singapore and 

other parts of South East Asia. 

During FY2018, our overall team size 

increased by 16 team members on a net 

basis to 141 team members, equating to 

13% growth in overall team size. At the end 

of FY2018, our team deployment and team 

profile breakdown are as shown here.

of Fair Employment Practices (“Pledge”)1 and 

is also a member of the Singapore National 

Employers Federation. Through Boustead 

Services, we are indirectly a party to the 

Pledge, adhering to the fair employment 

practices adopted by the Boustead Group.

Under the Pledge, we have committed to 

work towards fair employment practices 

including:

• 

Recruiting and selecting employees on 

the basis of merit regardless of age, race, 

gender, religion, marital status and family 

responsibilities or disability;

• 

Treating employees fairly and with 

respect, and implementing progressive 

HRM systems;

• 

Providing employees with equal 

opportunity to be considered for 

training and development based on 

their strengths and needs to help them 

achieve their full potential;

• 

Rewarding employees fairly based on 

their ability, performance, contribution 

and experience; and

• 

Complying with the labour laws and 

abiding by the Tripartite Guidelines on 

Fair Employment Practices.

Apart from the Pledge, we promote gender 

equality at the workplace. In terms of talent 

attraction, this means that we offer the 

same basic remuneration package to all 

interviewing job candidates for a specific role 

and scope, regardless of gender or whether 

a job candidate has served Singapore’s 

mandatory national service.

b) Other Talent Attraction Practices

We generally advertise available positions 

both externally and internally, although 

recruitment for certain sensitive key 

positions may be conducted anonymously 

through professional recruitment agencies. 

Where possible, we seek to employ citizens 

from countries where we operate. Since 

2014, we have also adhered to Singapore’s 

Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”)’s Fair 

Consideration Framework that requires 

available positions – unless exempted – to 

be advertised on the national Jobs Bank for 

at least 14 days, thereby giving citizens fair 

consideration for all job opportunities before 

hiring foreign professionals to fill these 

positions.2

Adding to our potential talent pool, we are 

one of 10 sponsoring organisations within 

the engineering industry participating in 

the Singapore-Industry Scholarship (“SgIS”) 

Programme.3 Launched in 2012 and co-

funded by both the Singapore Government 

and private sector organisations, through 

Boustead Singapore Limited, we are a 

founding private sector organisation within 

the SgIS, a multi-industry undergraduate 

scholarship programme that aims to groom 

future Singaporean industry leaders in 

strategic sectors that are critical for the 

country’s development. To date, we have 

given scholarships to three individuals, all 

of whom have since completed their local 

university degree programmes and joined  

us in full-time capacities.

As mentioned earlier, during FY2018,  

we experienced 13% growth in overall team 

size, in contrast to Singapore’s average 

employment level declines at both the 

comparable industries and national levels, 

which were down 7.7% and 0.1% respectively 

in 2017.4 Our growth in overall team size was 

led by the hiring of 67 new team members 

equating to a 50% overall team hires rate. 

Most new team members joined our  

design-and-build and real estate 

development teams in Singapore and 

Vietnam, where business activities have 

been steadily increasing. The team hires 

breakdown is shown on page 36 of this 

report.

4.2.2 Talent Development, Management 

&amp; Retention

As part of our TDP, we embrace a holistic 

talent development, management and 

retention strategy. 

a) Conditions of Employment

We believe in treating our team fairly, with 

respect and an entitlement to human rights. 

We offer conditions of employment and 

benefits that are in line with applicable 

employment laws and regulations, and 

prevailing market practices in countries 

where we operate including:

• 

Reasonable break times, rest days and 

working hours, with overtime pay for 

eligible team members;

• 

Paid leave entitlements which depending 

on contractual terms, and applicable 

laws and regulations as stipulated by 

Singapore’s MOM or other foreign 

government labour agencies include 

adoption leave, annual leave, childcare 

leave, compassionate leave, examination 

leave, marriage leave, maternity 

leave, national service leave, paternity 

leave, shared parental leave, sick and 

hospitalisation leave and unpaid infant 

care leave. We may also authorise unpaid 

leave depending on the reasons provided 

and subject to work arrangements;

• 

Defined contribution plans in line 

with applicable laws and regulations 

as stipulated by Singapore’s Central 

Provident Fund or other foreign 

government pension agencies;

• 

Group insurance plans covering business 

travel, hospitalisation and surgery, 

personal accidents, term life insurance 

and workmen compensation; and

• 

Group medical plans and flexible 

healthcare benefits.

b) Fair Remuneration

We have pledged to reward our team 

members fairly and equitably based on 

their ability, performance, contribution and 

experience. We offer fair and competitive 

remuneration packages, which may include 

overtime pay and annual wage supplements 

for eligible team members according to

On top of basic remuneration packages, 

team members also receive our payments 

to defined contribution plans. Salary 

benchmarking exercises are also conducted 

to ensure that remuneration packages are 

equitable with what the industry offers for 

similar positions.

There is a profit sharing bonus scheme 

for eligible full-time team members that is 

pegged to a predetermined formula based 

on our overall and respective subsidiaries’ 

financial performance. Individual bonus 

payments and annual salary increments are 

determined only after each team member’s 

performance appraisal (“appraisal”) 

is objectively assessed by our senior 

management team. In FY2018, we distributed 

a total of S$15.7 million in economic value to 

our team.

There is also a Boustead Projects Restricted 

Share Plan 2016 (“RSP”) that incentivises key 

team members to work towards department 

and individual key performance indicators 

(“KPIs”) and helps to align their interests with 

our long-term success. Team members who 

are selected to participate under the RSP and 

subsequently meet their KPIs for a specific 

financial year may be eligible to receive 

Boustead Projects’ shares, which are vested 

and issued in tranches over four years.  

More information on the RSP and earlier 

restricted share plans is available in the 

Boustead Projects FY2018 Annual Report 

on pages 44, 53, 54, 84 and 85.

c) Performance Appraisal

As part of our TDP, full-time team members 

are entitled to an appraisal at least once a 

year as part of our Performance Management 

System (“PMS”), with the exception of team 

members who are re-employed beyond the 

statutory retirement age, have resigned, are 

serving notice or under probation during the 

relevant appraisal period. Team members who 

are under probation will receive a confirmation 

appraisal at the time of confirmation. Team 

members are evaluated on their achievement 

of quantitative department and individual KPIs 

and qualitative skillset competencies relevant 

to their respective roles and scope, which are 

defined and set at the beginning of the period 

under review. 

Team members who consistently outperform 

are offered opportunities to take up higher 

challenges, while team members who 

underperform are assisted in identifying 

and addressing the root causes behind their 

underperformance. Our PMS allows us to 

identify team members with high leadership 

potential, feeding into our Succession 

Planning System (“SPS”).

Whenever possible, we promote team 

members internally into available senior 

positions. In addition, our Team Recognition 

Programme includes long service awards 

and specific achievement awards given 

to recognise project teams and individual 

team members for excellent performance in 

specific areas.

During FY2018, 83% of our team received

d) Communication &amp; Engagement

We encourage open communication and 

engagement. With an open door policy, our 

team members may provide feedback or 

raise concerns with direct supervisors  

and our senior management team. 

Appraisals also provide team members 

with an opportunity to provide and receive 

feedback on their performance and any  

other important matters.

As part of our communication and 

engagement, we organise townhall 

sessions on a bi-annual basis, serving as an 

organisation-wide communication session 

between our senior management team 

and team members. Townhall sessions are 

facilitated by external trainers and include 

team-building activities to promote cohesion 

and teamwork.

We have procedures to address and as 

much as possible, satisfactorily resolve team 

members’ grievances. This is complemented 

by our whistle-blowing mechanism.

e) Career Development &amp; Training 

Opportunities

We have pledged to provide our team 

members with equal opportunity to be 

considered for career development and 

training based on their strengths and 

needs, and to help them to achieve their 

full potential. We aim to nurture and 

professionally develop team members by 

investing in their career development and 

training, offering them growth opportunities 

through promotions, job rotations and 

overseas assignments. Team members can 

also upgrade skillsets and are generally 

encouraged to undergo professional  

training that may help their performance. 

This includes sponsoring or subsidising the 

cost of approved career development and 

training courses, and may also include granting 

paid leave to attend these courses. We also 

have an Education Assistance Scheme under 

which we may sponsor team members who 

desire to attend job-related courses on their 

own initiative and for personal development. 

While we identify the career development and 

training needs of team members at least once 

a year during appraisals, we also assess such 

needs on an ad-hoc basis. 

As we continue to pioneer new solutions 

and make investments in procuring 

and implementing transformational 

technologies, methodologies and system 

enablers, we have also made necessary 

investments in training team members so 

that they can realise the full benefits of these 

transformational technologies, some of 

which are shown here.

With technological advancements 

accelerating the pace of disruption and 

shortening business cycles, we believe that 

investments in training need to be adaptable, 

flexible and timely. 

During FY2018, our team underwent a 

total of 1,141 training hours, the breakdown 

as shown here. Training was emphasised 

across our team with no differentiation by 

gender and only minor variance between 

managerial and executive team members.

selected social, sports and recreational 

activities, health screening sessions and 

lunchtime health talk sessions. In addition, 

other types of lunchtime talk sessions on 

various topics of interest have been organised 

on a regular basis.

During FY2018, our team members took a 

total of 322 days of medical leave due to 

sickness or hospitalisation, the breakdown 

as shown here. However, none of this 

medical leave was in relation to workplace 

safety and health incidents, accidents or 

diseases.

g) Employment Beyond Statutory 

Retirement Age

We may offer our team members re-

employment beyond Singapore’s statutory 

retirement age of 62 years, as guided by 

applicable laws and regulations, and our 

policies on retirement and re-employment. 

Any re-employment and extension of re-

employment depends on whether a retiring 

team member’s services are required, the 

team member is medically certified to be fit 

for employment and is able to perform at an 

acceptable level. In general, we try to provide 

re-employment whenever possible, given 

that retiring team members have decades of 

experience and can still be highly productive 

and motivated.

During FY2018, we had no team members 

under re-employment beyond the statutory 

retirement age.

h) Succession Planning

We recognise that having adequate 

succession planning is a key priority and 

essential to our business continuity. We 

have a SPS for our senior management 

team and key executives. Core leadership 

positions are covered by deputies or 

experienced potential replacements, 

who are identified through our PMS as 

being team members with high leadership 

potential to be developed and nurtured into 

next-generation leaders. 

At the end of FY2018, 100% of our senior 

management team and key executive 

positions – a total of 10 team members –  

were covered by a named deputy or 

designated successor. Our Managing  

Director also had at least two named  

deputies or designated successors.

i) Termination of Employment &amp;  

Turnover

Our team members are entitled to 

compensation according to severance 

clauses in their employment contracts 

if we terminate their services. Under all 

circumstances, we seek to ensure that  

any termination of employment is  

conducted in a fair and lawful manner.  

We have also implemented procedures  

to ensure that affected team members  

are properly compensated and may also 

receive job placements or other forms 

of assistance in addition to monetary 

compensation if we retrench them.

As with any corporation, we have not been 

spared from natural attrition and turnover 

of team members. During FY2018, we had 

turnover of 49 team members equating to 

a 36% overall team turnover rate. However, 

in excess of 42% of overall team turnover 

was due to significant rightsizing of our 

Malaysia operations as market conditions 

there remained weak. Excluding the effects of 

Malaysia, our overall team turnover rate would 

have been within market norms. The team 

turnover breakdown is shown here.

4.3 CREATING A POSITIVE WORK 

ENVIRONMENT

We are highly committed to creating a positive 

work environment, where our team, clients, 

suppliers and other key stakeholders feel 

comfortable, safe and secure within  

and around our operations regionally.  

Our positive work environment is designed 

and organised to be conducive for delivering 

our solutions in a productive manner and 

facilitating interactions with key stakeholders, 

along with meeting applicable laws and 

regulations in countries where we operate.

4.3.1 Workplace Health &amp; Safety  

Above All

Of utmost importance, we care deeply about 

safeguarding the wellbeing of our team, 

beginning with our workplace safety and 

health (“WSH”) management performance 

and system enablers that apply to our team 

and all key stakeholders who are affected by 

our operations regionally.

From a WSH standpoint, the United Nations’ 

International Labour Organization has 

estimated that there are 2.78 million deaths 

every year due to occupational accidents and 

work-related diseases. In addition, there are 

374 million non-fatal occupational accidents 

and work-related diseases, many which result 

in extended work absences. The human 

cost of this daily adversity is vast with the 

economic burden of poor WSH practices 

costing an estimated 3.94% of global gross 

domestic product each year.5

In Singapore, although incidences of 

occupational accidents, fatalities and 

diseases are much lower than the global 

average, the local construction industry 

remains a major contributor to such 

incidences, with the industry having the 

highest number of fatalities in 2017.

As part of our WSH Management System 

(“WSHMS”), we first embarked on SS506  

Part 1:2009 and OHSAS 18001:2007 

certifications in 2006 and have had a 

WSHMS in place ever since. Shortly after 

the end of FY2018 in April 2018, our major 

design-and-build subsidiary in Singapore, 

Boustead Projects E&amp;C Pte Ltd (“BP E&amp;C”) 

received recertification under both standards. 

Our WSHMS sets out WSH management 

system enablers, commitments, targets and 

responsibilities for our team, with overriding 

responsibility belonging to our Environmental, 

Health and Safety (“EHS”) Team headed 

by our EHS Director, a member of our 

senior management team. Our EHS Team 

manages all aspects of our WSHMS which 

is both externally and internally audited, and 

ensures WSH management performance at 

all workplaces and project sites under our 

control on a daily basis.

We have zero tolerance for accidents and are 

committed to saving lives through safe work. 

This is encapsulated in our safety slogan 

‘Safe Work, Save Lives’ which has become 

a daily mantra among team members and 

suppliers who undertake work at our project 

sites. Although we outsource construction 

trades to suppliers and do not directly hire any 

construction workers, we take responsibility 

to ensure their health and safety at our project 

sites and the general public’s health and safety 

in the communities around our project sites.

Through our Total WSH Policy, we are 

committed to:

5 

“Safety and Health at Work.” United Nations, International Labour Organization, www.ilo.org/global/topics/safety-and-health-at-work/lang--en/index.htm. Accessed 28 August 2018.

• Preventing injury and ill health for our team, 

workers and key stakeholders at our project 

sites;

• Complying with applicable legal 

requirements and with other requirements 

relating to WSH hazards;

• Creating better health and wellbeing for our 

team, workers and key stakeholders at our 

workplaces;

• Providing sufficient and appropriate 

resources to carry out the implementation 

of our WSHMS to ensure sustainable 

WSH standards for our team, workers and 

stakeholders at our project sites; and

• Continual improvement in WSH 

management and performance.

Our WSHMS is supported by investments  

in technologies. Internally, we developed  

an Integrated Boustead Online Safety  

System (“iBOSS”), which provides us with  

a centralised platform to manage all permit-

to-work applications and safety induction 

course bookings. Through digitisation, 

iBOSS has replaced time-consuming 

administrative processes and provides us with 

data governance, traceability and tracking 

capabilities in documenting administrative 

and safety records. The current iteration 

of iBOSS also includes a biometric facial 

recognition system used to administer project 

site access and security.

The tone for WSH performance is set at the 

top, where our senior management team 

‘walks the talk’ when it comes to prioritising 

WSH issues and system enablers. In terms of 

engagement, a monthly safety management 

meeting is conducted with our senior 

management team, EHS Team, all WSH 

professionals and project site teams.  

Weekly safety management meetings are 

also conducted with our EHS Team engaging 

with respective project site safety committees 

and WSH professionals on safety inspections. 

WSH professionals also carry out daily project 

site toolbox talks and safety inspections with 

the safety supervisors from all suppliers.

Specific measurable WSH targets are set 

under our WSHMS, which are tracked and 

reviewed at the very minimum during monthly 

safety management meetings. While our 

perpetual WSH target is to achieve zero 

accidents or safety incidents at all workplaces 

and project sites, we also set short-term WSH 

targets to address adverse safety trends. 

Our current short-term WSH targets include 

eliminating incidents of personnel or objects 

falling from height.

4.3.2 Continuous WSH Education &amp; 

Training

No where else do we emphasise continuous 

education and training more than in WSH 

education and training, in order to immerse 

our team and key stakeholders in the 

right WSH culture and improve our WSH 

performance. Our training programmes 

include a Centralised Safety &amp; Quality 

Induction Training Course conducted for team 

members, suppliers and visitors to our project 

sites, and an Enhanced Safety Induction 

Course in partnership with external training 

centres to provide safety training in relation 

to working at heights awareness for team 

members and suppliers.

Our EHS Team, WSH professionals and 

project site teams have the responsibility of 

ensuring that suppliers conduct appropriate 

in-house safety training for their workers

before deploying them to our project 

sites and that such training is properly 

documented. We also have a Safety 

Awareness Promotion Programme that gives 

widespread recognition to the efforts of WSH 

professionals, safety supervisors, suppliers 

and workers in achieving WSH milestones.

Continuing our WSH performance in FY2018, 

we had no reportable accidents or safety 

incidents at our administrative workplaces, 

and zero fatalities and occupational disease 

incidents within our team and suppliers’ 

workers across our operations regionally. 

Our accident frequency rate (“AFR”) and 

accident severity rate (“ASR”) at project sites 

in Singapore also compared favourably with 

Singapore’s average AFR and ASR at both the 

comparable industries and national levels.6

4.3.3 bizSAFE Mentorship

In 2008, we initiated our participation in 

Singapore’s Workplace Safety &amp; Health 

Council (“WSHC”)’s bizSAFE Programme 

by becoming a bizSAFE Partner. In 

2009, we achieved the bizSAFE Star, the 

highest qualification that can be attained 

in recognition of a corporation’s WSH 

management programmes.

By 2011, we opted to take a national 

leadership role in advocating and promoting 

excellent WSH practices in the construction 

industry by becoming a bizSAFE Mentor; 

currently one of only nine bizSAFE Mentors 

in Singapore and the only one among our 

direct competitors.7 bizSAFE Mentors are 

corporations that have excellent WSH 

performance and track records, and are 

qualified and invited only by the WSHC to 

take this national leadership role. bizSAFE 

Mentors incorporate WSH as an integral 

part of their business model that benefits 

the wider community and also actively 

work with the WSHC to promote the WSH 

agenda on various industry and national 

platforms. As a bizSAFE Mentor, we have 

been one of the key contributors in helping 

the bizSAFE Community to expand from 

10,000 corporations in 2011 to almost 30,000 

corporations in 2017.8

As part of our WSH advocacy and promotion 

efforts, and uplifting the WSH practices 

of the construction industry as a whole, 

we have made it compulsory for all of 

our suppliers to be part of the bizSAFE 

Programme and further encourage them 

to strive for bizSAFE Star, the highest 

qualification achievable. Excellent WSH 

performance is priceless when all lives are 

safeguarded and when people everywhere 

go home safely to their families from their 

workplaces everyday.

bizSAFE Programme

Continuing our WSH advocacy and 

promotion efforts in FY2018, we managed 

to raise 100% of our suppliers to at least 

bizSAFE Level 3 and 84% of our suppliers to 

bizSAFE Star.

4.3.4 WSH Awards

We are a regular feature at the WSH Awards, 

an annual awards programme hosted by 

the WSHC and MOM to recognise excellent 

WSH performance.

During FY2018 at the WSH Awards 2017 held 

in July 2017, we received a Safety &amp; Health 

Award Recognition for Projects (“SHARP”) 

for our landmark project of FY2017, GSK 

Asia House which today is home to GSK’s 

headquarters for Asia.

Shortly after the end of FY2018 at the WSH 

Awards 2018 held in July 2018, we received a 

SHARP for our landmark project of FY2018, 

ALICE @ Mediapolis developed under the 

Boustead Development Partnership and 

set to become Singapore’s first truly smart 

building in any business park.

To date, our excellent WSH performance 

has been recognised with the highest 

achievements under the bizSAFE 

Programme and 17 awards at the WSH 

Awards as shown here.

4.4 SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

We are committed to managing the impacts 

and risks associated with our supply 

chain.  Supplier-related impacts and risks 

are identified, addressed and managed 

under our various management systems, 

Enterprise Risk Management Framework, 

internal controls, and external and internal 

audits.

Our procurement includes products and 

services from a network of suppliers regionally 

based on a list of approved suppliers for 

various construction equipment services, 

materials and trade services. Supplier costs 

and other construction costs typically make 

up more than 90% of our total cost of sales. In 

FY2018, we distributed a total of S$149.0 million 

in economic value to suppliers.

Operationally, we manage our procurement 

through our procurement system enablers and 

list of approved suppliers, which are subject to 

regular review as well as external and internal 

audits.

Potential new suppliers are evaluated on 

their reputation, financial health, operations, 

quality and EHS performance for inclusion 

on our list of approved suppliers. Existing 

suppliers are regularly evaluated on their 

upkeep of their holistic performance with 

routine engagement and inspections 

throughout projects. As mentioned earlier, 

all suppliers are required to attain at least a 

bizSAFE Level 3 in order to qualify for our list 

of approved suppliers. We also ensure that 

approved suppliers are inducted in our Green 

&amp; Gracious Programme, which is shown on 

pages 43 and 44 of this report.

Violations of our holistic standards will result in 

appropriate disciplinary actions taken against 

violating suppliers including potential permanent 

removal from our list of approved suppliers 

and referral to legal authorities for serious 

violations that may be illegal in nature. On the 

other hand, suppliers that display performance 

that consistently meets our expectations 

may receive reward points that can be used 

to bolster their bids to us on future projects, 

thereby incentivising good performance.

INTRODUCTION

PLANET EARTH

For all global stakeholders and all known 

life, Earth is our collective home and the 

only home we know. Nature in all forms – 

both organic and inorganic – is the nurturer 

and provider of all that is necessary to 

sustain life. Over the past 200 years, the 

world’s population has grown exponentially 

with one billion people1 when the Boustead 

Group was first established in 1828 to over 

seven billion people today and an expected 

8.6 billion people by 2030.2 This has placed 

tremendous resource strains on our planet’s 

natural ecosystem.

Furthermore, close to four billion people 

live in urban centres and this is expected 

to increase to five billion people by 2030. 

Rapid urbanisation will lead to enormous 

challenges in government planning 

across all infrastructure, economic and 

environmental, social and governance 

(“ESG”) facets. Simultaneously, climate 

change – driven by greenhouse gas 

emissions contributed by human activities 

and agreed upon by 97% of actively 

publishing climate scientists3 – continues 

to result in natural disasters and extreme 

weather events that have disrupted 

national economies and hurt lives, people, 

communities and countries.4

Accompanying expected rapid urbanisation, 

construction activities for infrastructure will 

continue to grow. As a responsible corporate 

citizen, we plan to do our part in minimising 

our ecological footprint and contributing 

to ESG initiatives that transit beyond our 

organisational ecosystem to our planet’s 

natural ecosystem.

This section covers our environmental 

stewardship, legal and regulatory 

compliance, and community development, 

which are derived from the combined depth 

of all six capitals – financial, manufactured, 

intellectual, human, social and relationship, 

and natural – and ultimately deliver positive 

net effects for all six capitals.

5.1 ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP

Construction activities and buildings exert 

considerable impact on the environment 

during their multi-decade building lifecycles 

from the embodied energy of materials 

and construction to the operating energy 

of operations and maintenance, and finally 

demolishment at the end of buildings’ 

useful lives. This also presents significant 

opportunities to mitigate ecological footprints 

of construction activities and buildings in 

general. Earlier, we shared on pages 21 to 23 of 

this report how our eco-sustainable solutions 

have the potential to directly influence and 

reduce energy loss, emissions, pollution, and 

energy and water consumption in some of 

the most energy-intensive sectors, and work 

towards the extremely important planetary 

goal to combat climate change. Under this 

part of environmental stewardship, we 

will share our processes in environmental 

management.

INTRODUCTION

5.1.1 Environmental Management

We are highly committed to complying with all 

applicable environmental laws and regulations 

in countries where we operate. As part of our 

Environmental Management System (“EMS”) 

aimed at protecting the environment and 

preventing pollution at our operations regionally, 

we first embarked on ISO 14001 certification in 

2006 and have had an EMS in place ever since. 

Shortly after the end of FY2018 in April 2018,  

our major design-and-build subsidiary in 

Singapore, Boustead Projects E&amp;C Pte Ltd 

(“BP E&amp;C”) received an upgraded certification 

to the latest ISO 14001:2015 standard. Our 

EMS sets out environmental management 

system enablers, commitments, targets and 

responsibilities for our team, with overriding 

responsibility belonging to our Environmental, 

Health and Safety (“EHS”) Team headed by our 

EHS Director. This same team also oversees 

WSH performance. Our EHS Team manages all 

aspects of our EMS which is both externally and 

internally audited, and ensures environmental 

management performance at all workplaces 

and project sites under our control on a daily 

basis.

We are also committed to raising environmental 

awareness through our adoption of green 

practices.

5.1.2 Green &amp; Gracious Builder Scheme

We are a voluntary participant in the Building 

&amp; Construction Authority (“BCA”)’s Green &amp; 

Gracious Builder Scheme (“GGBS”) launched 

to promote environmental protection and 

gracious practices during construction 

activities. Having achieved a Green &amp; 

Gracious Builder Award (Excellent), we are 

committed to fulfilling our responsibility to the 

environment and the general public in terms 

of addressing environmental concerns and 

mitigating potential inconveniences to the 

general public in construction activities.  

Our Green &amp; Gracious Programme (“GGP”) is a 

subset of our EMS and sets out how we should 

fulfil our role as a Green &amp; Gracious Builder.   

Under the GGBS and our GGP, we periodically 

review and update construction processes and 

key performance indicators on ESG topics such 

as those shown here. Increasingly, there are 

overlaps in ESG topics, with fulfilment in one 

area contributing to benefits in the other areas.

Our GGP includes monitoring, performing and 

improving on internally set targets that cover 

areas such as reductions in concrete and 

re-bar wastage, waste disposal, direct energy 

and water consumption from construction 

operations, effluents, dust, noise and 

vibrations. Our targets are set at realistically 

achievable levels that are significantly better 

than the average performance of Singapore’s 

construction industry and the national level 

in these same topics, in which it was found 

that the construction industry contributed 

to in excess of 20% of all waste generated 

in Singapore in 2017. Although eventually 

99% of construction waste generated and 

61% of Singapore’s waste generated were 

recycled5, we believe that it is more important 

to reduce waste generation before the 

recycling phase since national resources – 

albeit a lower quantum are still required for 

recycling activities. We also require potential 

new subcontractors and suppliers (together 

“suppliers”) to be evaluated on their reputation, 

financial health, operations, quality and 

EHS performance for inclusion on our list of 

approved suppliers, with approved suppliers 

being inducted in our GGP.

Due care is taken to ensure that businesses, 

residents and visitors within communities 

neighbouring our project sites are 

communicated to and not unnecessarily 

inconvenienced by ongoing projects.  

These efforts include keeping our project 

sites clean and organised, protecting 

pathways and sidewalks that run along 

project sites, minimising dust, noise and 

vibrations, and putting up communications 

and signages where appropriate including 

ways to contact us should there be any major 

inconveniences.

During FY2018, we met all targets in terms 

of reducing concrete, re-bar wastage and 

waste disposal costs.

For our commendable efforts and 

improvements under the GGBS, shortly after 

the end of FY2018 at the BCA Awards 2018 

held in May 2018, we received the Green &amp; 

Gracious Builder Award (Excellent) for overall 

excellent environmental, professional and 

sustainability practices, an upgrade from 

the Green &amp; Gracious Builder Award (Merit) 

attained in 2015.

5.1.3 Energy &amp; Water Efficiency

We have worked hard to improve the energy 

and water efficiency of our operations 

regionally in order to optimise the use 

of natural resources and mitigate our 

ecological footprint. Improving energy and 

water efficiency has also translated to lower 

operating costs and conversely higher 

profitability. Such gains have been achieved 

in two areas of our operations: during the 

construction phase of design-and-build 

projects and during the operational phase 

of multi-tenanted buildings that we have 

developed and continue to own and lease out.

Our design-and-build projects use diesel as 

a fuel for onsite diesel power generators, 

electricity drawn from the national power  

grid and water drawn from the national  

water network. We also collect rainwater 

which is treated and recycled for use in 

activities such as project site cleanliness and 

washing of vehicles leaving project sites. 

During FY2018, we measured our average 

energy and water intensity per square metre 

(“sq m”) of constructed gross floor area 

(“GFA”) – not including recycled water –  

for all significant design-and-build projects  

in Singapore as shown here.

Our administrative workplaces regionally 

and multi-tenanted developments in our 

leasehold portfolio draw on electricity from 

the national power grid and water from the 

national water network.

Our global headquarters is Edward Boustead 

Centre, a Green Mark Platinum–rated building 

with a high efficiency building envelope design 

and some of the highest ratings in energy and 

water efficiency. In terms of energy efficiency, 

Edward Boustead Centre uses double glazed 

low-emissivity glass to reduce heat flow into 

the building, more efficient T5 lighting, motion 

sensors that activate lighting at staircases and 

toilets, and a signature central skywell that 

allows plenty of natural lighting to penetrate 

even central areas of the building. In terms 

of water efficiency, Edward Boustead Centre 

uses extremely efficient water fittings and 

has a rainwater harvesting system to recycle 

captured rainwater towards water-intensive 

horticultural and toilet flushing purposes. 

Edward Boustead Centre also has air handling 

unit condensate recycling, sky terraces and a 

rooftop garden to reduce heat island effects, 

which together with the earlier mentioned 

green features result in estimated carbon 

dioxide savings of 264 tonnes annually, 

equivalent to the emissions of 20,948 cars in 

a day.

During FY2018, we began to actively track the 

electricity consumption at all administrative 

workplaces regionally to provide a baseline 

for comparison against our future usage. In 

terms of multi-tenanted developments within 

our leasehold portfolio constructed after the 

launch of mandatory submission under the 

BCA’s Green Mark Programme in 2008,  

there was only one fully operational

the only other multi-tenanted development, 

ALICE @ Mediapolis still under construction 

and expected to be fully operational only in 

FY2019. We do not track the energy and water 

usage at other properties within our leasehold 

portfolio as they are mainly single-tenanted 

properties and hence, energy and water 

usage is driven by clients’ processes, which 

can significantly differ based on respective 

clients’ business activities.

During FY2018, we measured our energy 

and water consumption for administrative 

workplaces regionally and Edward Boustead 

Centre as shown here. The energy use 

intensity (“EUI”) of Edward Boustead

Centre also compared extremely favourably 

with Singapore’s average EUI at both the 

comparable buildings and national levels 

and is in the second best performing quartile 

for comparable buildings.6 The water use 

intensity (“WUI”) of Edward Boustead Centre 

was in line with Singapore’s median WUI for 

comparable buildings.7 

5.1.4 Waste Reduction

Under environmental stewardship, we 

believe that waste reduction should be 

undertaken in both big and small ways. 

We encourage our team to reduce paper 

usage and to reuse or recycle non-sensitive 

paper waste where practicable. In FY2015, 

building on our green initiative, we adopted 

a paperless electronic format for annual 

reports and in FY2018, further phased out 

CD copies of annual reports altogether 

to reduce plastic waste as well. We have 

also digitised most of our previously hard 

copy-based records where appropriate and 

continue to use IT systems and software 

solutions to improve our data governance 

and productivity, which helps to reduce yet 

another form of waste – time waste. In fact, 

our investments in integrated digital delivery 

and building information modelling (“BIM”) 

have significantly improved digitalisation and 

productivity efforts, and almost eliminated 

paper usage while drastically reducing 

potential human errors in projects where  

BIM has been applied.

5.2 LEGAL &amp; REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

We are highly committed to fully complying with 

applicable laws and regulations in countries 

where we operate. Often, these laws and 

regulations cross the boundaries of economic 

and ESG topics, covering almost all aspects of 

our business and are governed under the scope 

of different government ministries, agencies, 

statutory boards and regulators.

In Singapore, the main government 

stakeholders and regulators that we regularly 

communicate with are shown on page 46 

of this report. In other countries where we 

operate, we regularly communicate with 

government stakeholders and regulators that 

are similar in scope.

INTRODUCTION

Government stakeholders and regulators 

give us our business licences to conduct 

our operations regionally. Full compliance 

with applicable laws and regulations cannot 

be overstated and is inherent in all system 

enablers. Relevant on-the-job training is 

provided to team members to ensure that 

they comprehend and meet the requirements 

of laws and regulations that apply to their job 

scopes. In addition, professional training may 

also be extended to specific team members 

in order for them to better comprehend and 

meet the requirements of applicable laws and 

regulations in high-risk economic and ESG 

topics. Other than government stakeholders 

and regulators, we may at times also have to 

comply with laws and regulations embedded 

within contractual terms set by clients and 

lenders, who have to ensure compliance with 

laws and regulations which are specific to 

their industries.

In FY2018, we had zero significant fines,  

non-monetary sanctions or cases brought 

against us through dispute resolution 

mechanisms by government stakeholders 

and regulators in economic and ESG facets.

We also had zero substantiated complaints 

received from external parties and regulators 

or identified leaks, thefts or losses of customer 

data under the customer privacy area.

5.3 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT

We are committed to community 

development and selecting an appropriate 

externally-managed community development 

programme to support on a long-term basis. 

At times, we also undertake philanthropic 

fund raising through our own fund raising 

platforms in collaboration with our suppliers. 

Communities in countries where we operate 

benefit directly from our donations both in 

monetary terms and in-kind to organisations 

that run community development 

programmes and also indirectly through 

the projects that we undertake for  

end-user clients, which provide jobs to  

those communities and ESG benefits.

During FY2017, we raised and committed 

S$290,000 in donations to help Student Care 

Services, now known as SHINE Children &amp; 

Youth Services (“SHINE”) during our Boustead 

Projects 20th Anniversary Charity &amp; Golf 

Dinner. SHINE runs centres assisting at-risk 

and under-privileged youths through social 

work, educational psychology, training and 

consultancy. Our donations helped SHINE to 

reach and touch the lives of almost 5,000 at-

risk and under-privileged youths.

During FY2018, we committed S$30,000 

in donations to various causes. Our team 

members also participated by giving their time 

to participate in some of the Boustead Group’s 

community development programmes.  

Our noticeable reduction in donations for 

FY2018 is due to our ongoing evaluation 

of a new externally-managed community 

development programme that we can support 

in a meaningful way on a long-term basis.

5.4 CONCLUSION

Although we have achieved respectable 

performance in material ESG topics,  

we recognise that we can and must do better. 

After we collect and report on at least two 

years’ worth of data on material ESG topics, 

our Board will consider setting medium-term 

longevity performance targets in material ESG 

topics where targets have not already been 

set. Hand-in-hand with our stakeholders, we 

intend to continue our role as a responsible 

corporate citizen, one which we hope to 

honour for many more decades to come. Join 

us in this ultra-triathlon.

This inaugural Boustead Projects FY2018

without the efforts of our team who has 

worked extremely hard over the past 22 

years and continues to emulate the efforts 

of thousands of Boustead Men and Women 

who strived to deliver sustainable value  

and progress to multiple generations of  

key stakeholders and make a positive impact 

economically, environmentally and socially 

on the world over the past 190 years.  

We continue to live out our mission and 

vision for key stakeholders and in memory of 

the Boustead Group’s founder, Mr Edward 

Boustead and our fellow team members who 

have passed on or retired. We are grateful 

to our team members today, who are still 

running this ultra-triathlon for us.
