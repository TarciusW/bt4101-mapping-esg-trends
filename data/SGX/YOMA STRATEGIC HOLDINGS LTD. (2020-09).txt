Wave Money 

Increase in 23,000 Wave agents from March 2019 to more than 68,000 agents in urban and 

rural communities; 10 new additional townships from last year and the comprehensive network covers 299 out of 

330 townships nationwide.

Wave Money is supporting 37 projects, including social security payments under the Ministry 

of Labour, Immigration and Population; loan disbursements for farmers from the Myanmar Agricultural 

Development Bank; cash transfers to pregnant women and children under the Maternal and Child Cash Transfer 

program of the Department of Social Welfare.

Over 1.5 million digital monthly active users (MAUs) on WavePay app and more than 3.9 million

Wave Money is also involved in the emergency funds for laid off garment workers from the Myan Ku 

Fund project of the European Union which is financed through the European Union’s Humanitarian Development 

Peace Nexus Response Mechanism managed by the United Nations Office for Project’s Services.

No charges for COVID-19 related disbursements to help organisations delivering aid to vulnerable sectors.

Donations and disbursements from January to December 2020 to those severely affected by the COVID-19 

pandemic reached 32 billion kyat (US$ 24 million), peaking during the first wave of the crisis 

from April to June 2020. As of December 2020, relief efforts facilitated by Wave Money have reportedly reached

Yoma Fleet

Yoma Fleet provides customers with equipment financing solutions with a portfolio of 1,200 units of vehicles, 

heavy equipment and related assets. Yoma Fleet helps customers utilise new equipment offerings, which are 

more efficient and environmentally friendly than Myanmar’s existing stock of aged equipment near the end of its 

useful life.

Yoma Car Share’s nationwide coverage across five regions and nine cities provides a  

car sharing system as a cost-effective alternative to car ownership, playing a positive role in the development 

of urban infrastructure in Myanmar. Customers are able to select from a fleet of nearly 100 new left-hand drive 

cars that are more environmentally friendly than the typical 10-15 year old rental vehicles available elsewhere. 

Vehicles can be reserved through a fully automated system from pick-up, drop-off to payment.

ABOUT THIS REPORT

Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd. (“Yoma 

Strategic” or collectively with its 

subsidiaries, the “Group”) is pleased to 

present its third Sustainability Report, 

which describes its sustainability 

initiatives and performance for FP2020. 

This Report also addresses issues that 

Yoma Strategic has identified as the 

most important to its stakeholders.

Yoma Strategic publishes a Sustainability Report on an annual 

basis. The Sustainability Report has been prepared in accordance 

with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core 

option and is aligned with the Singapore Exchange (“SGX-ST”) 

Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (set out in listing rules 711A 

and 711B). The data presented in this FP2020 Sustainability 

Report covers an 18-month time frame. Where possible, the 

Group has reported its performance over a 12-month period from 

1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020 (“12M-Mar2020”) and 6-month 

period from 1 April 2020 to 30 September 2020 (“6M-Sept2020”) 

to provide a more meaningful comparison on the progress 

of its sustainability efforts. The scope of this Report covers 

approximately 80% of the Group’s revenues and more than 80% 

of the Group’s total assets in Singapore and Myanmar. Operations 

in China as well as companies and joint ventures where Yoma 

Strategic holds a share of less than 50% are excluded from the 

scope of this Report with the exception of Yoma Central (48%), 

Yoma Micro Power (35%) and Wave Money (34%)3. A complete 

overview of the Group’s entities can be found on page 6 of this 

Report. This Report has not been assured by a third party, but 

the Group is planning to seek external assurance for future 

reports, once it has completed the intended deep integration of 

sustainability into its operations and verified that all management 

systems are reliably producing the required metrics.

This report demonstrates the Group’s commitment to keep 

stakeholders abreast of its sustainability performance and all 

feedback from its stakeholders are welcomed.

CEO'S STATEMENT

During these challenging times, our top priorities have been 

protecting the wellbeing of our employees and their families, 

mitigating the spread of COVID-19, and running our businesses 

safely. Yet we have also retained our focus on our core mission 

– Build a Better Myanmar for Its People, while supporting 

the principles of the UN Global Compact and Sustainable 

Development Goals ("SDGs"). 

The Group’s businesses have contributed to the growth and 

development in Myanmar in many ways, from improving financial 

inclusion in Myanmar by serving the unbanked and underbanked 

communities through Wave Money, providing electricity through 

renewable energy for rural villages through Yoma Micro Power, to

providing modern affordable apartments for the aspiring middle-

income population through Yoma Land.

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digital 

transformation of many businesses and we have witnessed 

this trend first-hand in several of our operations as we rethink 

our interactions with our customers, suppliers and employees. 

At Yoma Strategic, we are taking every possible precaution 

to protect our people including implementing digital tools 

and accelerating processes to facilitate “Work from Home”. 

We accelerated the rollout of the Yoma Connect digital 

platform for internal communication and held regular virtual 

townhall meetings to maintain staff morale and ensure close 

connection during this time apart. As a result of these efforts, 

we are pleased to share that our employee satisfaction survey 

continued to improve despite the challenging environment and 

our staff reported pride in being part of the Yoma Family.

We are doing everything we can to support our customers 

across the various business segments, improving and changing 

the way we work while tapping on digital platforms to better 

engage our customers. We also continued our engagement 

with our institutional and retail investors through virtual 

group and one-on-one meetings to keep them abreast of the 

developments in Myanmar and in the Group’s businesses.

In serving the communities where we live and work, we strive 

to create jobs, mitigate impacts to biodiversity and respond to 

local concerns. Responsibilities of governance-related priorities 

including the management of environmental and social risks are 

extended from our Board downward to our executive leadership 

team, managers and employees at all levels.

Yoma Strategic will continue to serve the people of Myanmar. 

Our partnerships with Ayala Corporation (“Ayala”) and Ant 

Group Co.,Ltd (“Ant Group”) are expected to be far-reaching 

and will strengthen the Group’s future growth prospects. We will 

continue to leverage our businesses to help people, businesses 

and society while making the most of and adjusting to the ‘new 

normal’, and will continue to innovate to drive growth.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

Yoma Strategic is committed to supporting the UNSDGs in its operations.

SDG

YOMA STRATEGIC’S CONTRIBUTIONS

The Group’s businesses provide approximately 5,2384 jobs to locals in Myanmar. All of its employees 

are paid at least the statutory minimum wage. Aside from direct employment, the Group also supports 

local businesses, job creation and financial inclusion in communities throughout Myanmar. For instance, 

Wave Money, a mobile based financial services provider that facilitates secure and real-time payment 

transactions, runs a network of more than 68,000 agents in both urban and rural communities across 299 

townships. It caters to approximately 70% unbanked population of Myanmar, many of whom are micro and 

small businesses as well as migrant workers who have relocated to urban centres in search of employment 

but periodically remit their salaries to support their families in rural areas. Wave Money has also become a 

trusted partner for many government departments and non-profit organisations in disbursing COVID-19 

relief funds.

Yoma Heavy Equipment is committed to facilitate the mechanisation of Myanmar’s agricultural industry 

with the aim of helping farmers improve crop profitability and save time, energy and labour. Since 2012, the 

Group has sold approximately 4,200 tractors via its self-managed locations5, over 300 independent business 

associates and 30 independent parts distributors and continues to support a dedicated maintenance 

team to better serve rural communities throughout the country. Yoma Heavy Equipment also sponsored 

Myanmar’s first cassava conference and workshop to educate farmers about the crop’s potential, which was 

attended by the Ministry of Agriculture, the Department of Agricultural Research (DAR), the Department of 

Agriculture (DOA), local farmers and other stakeholders.

Various Yoma Group6 companies are partners of M2030. M2030 is a movement launched by the Asia Pacific 

Leaders Malaria Alliance (APLMA) to eliminate malaria in Asia by 2030. The existing M2030 partners include 

Pun Hlaing Siloam Hospitals, Wave Money, Volkswagen, New Holland, JCB, KFC, Auntie Anne’s, YKKO, Little 

Sheep Hotpot and Yoma Micro Power.

Approximately 41% of the Group’s workforce is female. In addition, Yoma Strategic has a 22% female 

representation on its Board of Directors as at November 2020. Training programs on building and 

maintaining a respectful workplace were rolled out in 12M-Mar2019. As at 30 September 2020, more than 

80% of the Group’s managers underwent such training which covered topics that included anti-harassment, 

maternity planning and career development.

As of September 2020, Yoma Micro Power has constructed and commenced operations at 318 off-grid 

solar micro power plants. Approximately 812 households in 11 villages in off-grid areas now have access to 

electricity. Yoma Micro Power plans to scale up to 750 solar micro power plants in financial year ending 

30 September 2021 and to more than 2,000 by the end of 2023.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

SDG

YOMA STRATEGIC’S CONTRIBUTIONS

The Group fully supports and practices the International Labour Organisation’s Eight l Core Conventions 

and the IFC’s Labour and Working Conditions Standards. The Group prohibits child labour at all of its 

business operations and projects, and there were no cases of child labour reported in 18M-Sept2020.

Yoma Land has developed City Loft, a product offering of quality affordable housing that caters to the 

underserved the middle-income market, in-line with its wider mission to build better communities for the 

future of Myanmar. The first project City Loft @ StarCity is expected to include commercial, communal and 

recreational areas and is designed to facilitate modern living standards that allow an inclusive community to 

thrive. 

Yoma Central, an integrated mixed-use development currently under construction in downtown Yangon, 

has adopted IFC EDGE (Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) as a sustainability standard for green 

design and construction principles. For example, the project plans to install low-emissivity glazing windows 

to reduce solar heat gain and will utilise natural day light and ventilation to minimise energy consumption.

The Group has generated approximately 0.57TJ of renewable energy from solar panels which were installed 

at Star City and The Campus. This is equivalent to the monthly electricity consumption of approximately 

920 households in Myanmar7. 

The Group strongly opposes bribery and all other kinds of corruption. To reinforce its Code of Conduct, 

the Group conducts training for all employees covering its policies on Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption, 

Conflicts of Interest and Whistle Blowing. These policies extend to the Group’s business dealings with third 

party service providers and vendors. 

The Group prohibits any form of discrimination or preference made on the basis of race, colour, sex, religion 

or political opinion which has the effect of impairing equal opportunity or treatment. As a committed 

nation builder, the Group believes that it is important to lead by example so as to ensure that internationally 

recognised best practices are established early on in the rapid development of Myanmar.

This Sustainability Report was prepared based on the internationally recognised Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) framework and 

aligned with the Singapore Exchange’s Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.

YOMA STRATEGIC'S

APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY



The Yoma Central site sits at the intersection between three Yangon townships – Pabedan, Dagon and Kyauktada. Various 

stakeholders based on their area of influence including township officials were engaged, and issues relating to the project’s impact on 

traffic, vibration, dust, noise, structural impact and damage to existing buildings in downtown were discussed. Some of the changes, 

which emerged based on the public’s input, have not only supported Yoma Central development, but also had an immediate impact 

on the community. For instance, based on the suggestion from the community, the Yoma Central team rerouted and improved the 

storm drains for the Yangon City Development Committee (YCDC). This led to improved flood mitigation for both the project and

concerns with the local community were incorporated in Yoma Central’s final design and ESIA (Environmental and Social Impact 

Assessment) submission and environmental mitigation measures.

The Group conducted its first materiality assessment and stakeholder engagement survey in 2018 through a third-party 

sustainability consultant to gather inputs from its key stakeholders on the significant issues relevant to our businesses. Since 2019, 

the Group has expanded the boundaries of its Sustainability Report to include new entities that have an impact on its material topics. 

In FP2020, the Group has improved its data collection process resulting in a better accuracy and reliability of the data. To enable 

employees to make sustainability part of their jobs, the sustainability team has also conducted regular engagement exercises with 

the various business units to raise awareness through employee training programs. An internal review of the Group’s material topics 

is carried out annually by the Sustainability Committee to ensure that they are still relevant to its businesses and stakeholders.

ECONOMIC

PERFORMANCE 

OUR BUSINESS

The Group aims to generate good returns to shareholders and 

other stakeholders who it works with. Despite COVID-19, all 

major business units recorded improvement in their top-line 

performances during FP2020. Yoma Strategic has also forged 

long-term strategic partnerships with reputable international 

companies including Ayala and Ant Group to contribute 

investment and expertise to the Group‘s businesses. Ayala‘s

US$155 million investment in Yoma Strategic represents one of 

the largest single foreign direct investments into Myanmar, and 

the largest ever investment into the country by the Philippines 

private sector. The partnership between Ant Group and Wave 

Money is another milestone for the Group and Ant Group's 

US$73.5 million investment and expertise are expected to 

accelerate Wave Money‘s digital transformation and facilitate the 

mass adoption of digital payments across the country to drive 

greater financial inclusion.

The Group’s telecommunications towers investment had 

generated significant returns for the Group over the past five 

years. In November 2019, the Group divested its remaining 

12.5% stake in edotco Myanmar, growing a total investment of 

US$20.0 million in 2014 to US$92.5 million upon exit. As part of 

the Group’s strategy to monetise the investment gains in non-

core asset portfolio and to recycle capital into the expansion of 

our core businesses, proceeds from the sale were redeployed 

to acquire an additional 10% stake in Wave Money and to reduce 

the Group‘s overall debt levels, allowing us to manage a prudent 

balance sheet.

The Group’s revenue for FP2020 was US$144.2 million and the 

economic value retained is a negative US$19.2 million. For more 

information on the Group’s FP2020 audited results, please refer 

to the financial report on page 96 to 104 of Yoma Strategic’s 

FP2020 annual report.

ETHICAL BUSINESS 

The Group is strongly opposed to bribery and all other kinds of 

corruption. This also extends to its business dealings with third-

party service providers and vendors. Its steadfast adherence to 

prudent business principles has seen Yoma Strategic become 

a trusted partner to some of the world’s leading brands as they 

look to expand into Myanmar. The Group also has the continued 

active support of IFC, ADB and FMO who are working in 

partnership to help the Group fulfil its mission according to these 

same principles.

OUR BUSINESS

ANTI-CORRUPTION, ANTI-BRIBERY

&amp; POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS

GRI 205-2, GRI 415-1

OUR APPROACH

Yoma Strategic manages its exposure to corruption risks by 

applying and emphasising good corporate governance, business 

ethics and transparency. Its reputation is one of its greatest 

assets. Corruption represents a risk to an organisation’s 

business and reputation. The Group is committed to a 

high standard of corporate governance for the long-term 

sustainability of the Group’s business. It has a zero-tolerance 

approach to corruption, bribery and fraud, and has developed a 

number of key policies and procedures such as Anti-Bribery and 

Anti-Corruption Policy, Code of Conduct, Conflict of Interest 

Policy and Whistle Blowing Policy which are disseminated and 

available to all employees, contractors, suppliers and business 

partners and are also publicly available on Yoma Strategic’s 

website at http://www.yomastrategic.com. Direct or indirect 

contributions to political causes may also represent a corruption 

risk because they can be used to exert undue influence on the 

political process. Yoma Strategic is not making – and has never 

made – any financial or in-kind political contributions, directly or 

indirectly.

OUR PERFORMANCE 

The Group’s employees are required to undergo training on the 

policies and procedures. In 12M-Mar2020, approximately 13% of 

its new employees received training on Corporate Governance, 

Operational Compliance and Code of Conduct. As of FP2020, 

approximately 25% of its employees received this training. With 

effect from May 2020, this training has been made available 

online for all its employees.

OUR TARGET (FY2021)

COMPLIANCE

GRI 419-1, GRI 307-1

OUR APPROACH

The Group continuously advocates a strong corporate 

governance culture among its employees to ensure that they 

operate in an ethical and responsible manner. The Group strives 

to comply with the relevant national environmental policies, laws 

and regulations as well as the IFC’s Performance Standards, the 

ADB’s Safeguard Policy and the Sustainability Policy Framework 

from FMO. The Group’s Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) 

system is designed to achieve a prudent and reasonable balance 

between risk and return, while providing the framework for 

managing risks and future events effectively to both protect and 

enhance the business in meeting its strategic objectives. It sets

risk appetite, tolerance levels and approach to manage risks. For 

details on the Group’s Risk Management, please refer to pages 

40 and 41 in the Yoma Strategic’s FP2020 Annual Report.

OUR PERFORMANCE

Yoma Land is the first developer in Myanmar to have received the 

Environmental Compliance Certificate issued by MONREC in May 

2019 for Yoma Central. Yoma Central has also adopted IFC EDGE 

(Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) as a sustainability 

standard for green design and construction principles.

Yoma Strategic continues to maintain its ranking within the 

top 5% of listed companies on the Singapore Governance and 

Transparency Index 2020.

In FP2020, there were no significant fines or non-monetary 

sanctions for non-compliance with environmental laws or 

regulation.

OUR TARGET (FY2021)



Uphold and adhere to the Group's zero 

tolerance approach to corruption and bribery.



The Group strives to maintain compliance 

with relevant national environmental 

policies, laws and regulations as well as the 

IFC’s Performance Standards and the ADB’s

OUR PLANET

Balancing the need for rapid development with good 

stewardship of Myanmar’s resources, Yoma Strategic is 

dedicated to safeguarding, and where possible, improving 

Myanmar’s environment – for the people of Myanmar, and 

to ensure the sustainability of its own business. The Group 

is mindful of its environmental impact and aware of the 

complexities involved in topics like climate change and water 

preservation. Yoma Strategic considers its efforts to have an 

overall positive contribution to the environment but many 

challenges remain as Myanmar continues to develop.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY &amp; CLIMATE CHANGE

GRI 302-1, GRI 302-3, GRI 305-1, GRI 305-2, GRI 305-4

OUR APPROACH

To raise awareness and highlight the importance of integrating 

sustainability into the Group’s day-to-day operations, training 

on its sustainability initiatives, which include topics such as 

energy conservation and waste reduction are provided to its 

employees. At the same time, the Group has in place active 

outdoor air quality monitoring systems at Pun Hlaing Dulwich 

College and StarCity Dulwich College. Updates on the air quality 

are provided to all residences on a regular basis. Other initiatives 

that the Group has undertaken to raise employee’s awareness 

on environmental stewardship include World Clean Up Day, Earth

Hour and Earth Day activities, which the Group has been actively 

participating since 2018. It is also eliminating or reducing the use 

of single-use plastics across our various business units so as to 

minimise harm to the environment.

The management of climate-related risks and opportunities is 

an integral part of Yoma Strategic. Beyond meeting standard 

expectations, the Group encourages individual business units 

to implement their own initiatives to reduce energy use and 

waste. The Group has been collecting data from April 2017 

across its various subsidiaries to have a better understanding 

of its energy emissions. Calculations for fuel and electricity 

data for both buildings and non-buildings which are owned and 

operated by Yoma Strategic are made available and its energy 

intensities based on the most relevant metrics for the business 

segments are reported, as shown in the tables on page 19 and 20 

of this Report. The Group will continue to monitor and evaluate 

the relevance of the metrics used as its business continues to 

evolve. The Group aims to set quantitative targets in FY2021. 

OUR PERFORMANCE

Yoma Group6 was awarded the Earth Hour Hero Award 2020 in 

recognition of its actions and efforts to help the environment 

and to inspire others.

Yoma Land strives to be a leader in the property development 

industry with regards to socially responsible construction 

and development. Yoma Land team implements protocols to 

minimise environmental impacts, as much as possible, on the 

surrounding environment during the construction of its real 

estate projects. As a result, StarCity has seen a thriving variety 

of rare butterflies and wild bird species. Two ancient trees which

are on the Yoma Central site have been conserved and 

transplanted in the StarCity River Park project to protect these 

trees from damage during the construction period.

In FP2020, the Group consumed a total of 222,557,597 MJ of 

energy across our various businesses. 






SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

19

OUR PLANET

A total of 12,279,203 MJ of renewable solar energy was generated from Yoma Land and Yoma Micro Power in FP2020. The 570,665 

MJ of renewable energy generated by Yoma Land has allowed us to avoid approximately 360 tonnes of CO2

10. The 318 off-grid 

solar micro power plants constructed by Yoma Micro Power generated 11,708,538 MJ of solar energy which was sold to telecom 

towers and communities in FP2020. This is equivalent to approximately 7,274 tonnes of CO2

10 that was avoided through the use of 

renewable energy.

The Group’s overall Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in FP2020 was 18,986 tCO2e. For 12M-Mar2020, the overall Scope 1 and Scope 2 

emissions was 13,755 tCO2e, this is 6% lower compared to the same period last year which was 14,578 tCO2e.

The Group tracked and monitored the energy intensity and GHG intensity of its business segments, based on square area or man 

hours worked as a basis to calculate intensity. The process started in the period of 12-month period from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 

2019 (“FY2019”). With a better understanding of its performance, the Group aims to use these data to set its FY2021 targets.

The Group recognises that there are still certain challenges related to the reporting of its climate impact. It is working with dedicated 

sustainability staff from each business unit to improve its data collection process which include new methods, process and records 

for identifying accurate data. Partial data were obtained across the Group since the process of data collection started in FY2019. The 

process has been improving gradually as the Sustainability Committee has been delivering training to the staff from each business 

unit.

WATER USE &amp; REDUCTION

GRI 303-1

OUR APPROACH

The Group acknowledges its responsibility to preserve the 

quality of the land, water and air and actively work to protect 

and conserve the land it owns and operates on. Most of the 

Group’s Real Estate and Automotive &amp; Heavy Equipment 

business segments use groundwater. The water data includes 

15 Yoma Heavy Equipment branches, Ducati, Volkswagen 

and Mitsubishi showrooms, Pun Hlaing Estate’s buildings, The 

Campus, StarCity’s buildings, KFC restaurants, Pun Hlaing Estate 

and StarCity golf courses and the coffee plantation. Some of 

the Group’s companies are in the process of improving its data 

collection methodologies relating to water usage. As Myanmar’s 

infrastructure improves, the Group strive to include additional 

data in its future sustainability reports.

A total of 1,058,382 m3 was used in 12M-Mar2020. The volume 

of water used at Yoma Motors has increased due to an increase 

in the number of showrooms being opened in 12M-Mar2020. 

As we continue to implement water saving measures across 

our various business sectors, we will also continue to monitor 

our water consumption patterns to identify opportunities for 

resource conservation.

WASTE &amp; EFFLUENT 

GRI 306-2

OUR APPROACH

Yoma Strategic is raising awareness on reducing use of single 

use plastics and the importance of recycling to reduce items 

being sent to landfill. In addition to implementing guidelines in 

procurement practices to substantially reduce waste generation 

through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse, the Group 

also advocates for the use of reusable bottles or jars. The Group 

has been part of the “Refill Not Landfill” campaign since 2018.

OUR PERFORMANCE

Yoma Central reused 117,236 tonnes of waste and recycled 773 

tonnes of waste in 12M-Mar2020. The overall amount of waste 

being disposed in landfill from the Group was reduced from 

5,704 tonnes in FY2019 to 2,330 tonnes in 12M-Mar2020. This 

60% reduction in non-hazardous waste further demonstrates 

the Group’s commitment to caring for the environment and 

all employees played an instrumental role in being part of the 

collective effort to minimise waste generation.

To help reduce the amount of waste going to landfill, Pun Hlaing 

Estate has also started to compost organic waste which is later 

used for landscaping and residential projects. In FP2020, 30 

tonnes of waste was composted.

OUR PEOPLE

Yoma Strategic is setting the benchmark for domestic and international companies operating 

in Myanmar with its strong commitment to be a responsible employer. From state-of-the-art 

workplaces in its new corporate headquarters, The Campus at Pun Hlaing Estate, to the working 

conditions and career opportunities that the Group is bringing to all parts of Myanmar, Yoma 

Strategic is creating a work environment that reflects the best international business has to offer. 

The Group invests in its people to build careers around a shared culture of fairness, diversity, 

empowerment and recognition.







To facilitate transportation for employees who may need to 

go home urgently or see a doctor, the frequency of the shuttle 

buses from The Campus to Pun Hlaing Station in the downtown 

area and the Pun Hlaing Hospital were increased.

An employee survey was done in October 2020 to better 

understand the concerns and challenges faced by the Group's 

employees, and in relation to the survey, the Anargat Program 

(or “Future Program”) was rolled out in January 2021 to address 

these concerns. The Anargat Program provides support to the 

wellbeing and family life of all employees. As part of this program, 

a maternity leave policy offering longer leave options (20 weeks, 

40 weeks or up to 1 year) and guaranteeing employment at the 

end of the maternity leave, was offered to the Group’s female 

employees. This program also includes pre- and post-pregnancy 

support counselling, as well as financial support for delivery of 

the child. A lactation room is also available at The Campus to 

support breastfeeding mothers.

OUR PERFORMANCE

The Group is made up of 39 corporate entities, the vast majority 

of which are based in Myanmar. The Group recorded a 30% 

overall increase in headcount from 4,026 employees in FY2019 

to 5,2384 employees in FP2020. The increase in headcount was 

driven largely by YKKO, which accounts for approximately 21% 

of its total headcount. The Group completed its acquisition 

of a 65% interest in YKKO in March 2019. There are currently 

42 YKKO branches throughout Myanmar, with 28 branches in 

Yangon alone.

The Group has achieved 86% employee satisfaction in a survey 

and was ranked 3rd in the top 100 employer list in MyJob’s survey 

of great companies to work for in Myanmar25.

WORKFORCE MOVEMENT

GRI 401-1

OUR APPROACH

The Group invests in its people to build careers around a shared 

culture of fairness, diversity, empowerment and recognition. 

Successful employee engagement is a necessary requirement 

for the Group’s ambitious growth plans and progress towards 

achieving its mission. Last year was a challenging period for its 

employees and the Group has initiated a People 2020 Program, 

which centred around the four core areas with the aim of caring 

for its employees using a holistic approach:

Eat Well

Improvement to The Campus’s canteen and by 

providing healthier food options.

Save Well

A retirement savings plan for its employees where 

a portion of their salary is set aside for retirement 

purposes, the Group will match that amount  

for the employee to keep. This serves as a form of 

investment for the employee as it grows at  

an attractive rate. Upon retirement, the sum 

of money accumulated will be available for the 

employee. 

Live Well

Allow employees to gain access to affordable  

homes at subsidised interest rates from Yoma Bank.

Move Well

Enable the Group's employees to gain access to 

gyms and exercise programs in Yangon.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, medical coverage for 

its employees has doubled. To help the Group's employees 

who might be facing financial difficulties during this time, Yoma 

Bank has offered a 12 months’ interest free loan up to twice the 

employees’ monthly salary. The Group’s Yoma Plus program 

offers low interest rates for instalment plans which allows 

employees to buy laptops or mobile devices, while its Telehealth 

initiative provides for easy online medical support for employees 

who need to see the doctors regarding any medical concerns. 

A Yoma Connect app was also rolled out so that the Company 

could quickly communicate with employees.

OUR PEOPLE

TRAINING &amp; DEVELOPMENT, TALENT RETENTION

GRI 404-1

OUR APPROACH

The Group invests in its people to build careers around a shared culture of fairness, diversity, empowerment and recognition. As 

such, the training, development and retention of talent in the organisation is very important to the Group.

Developing the Group's workforce means providing continuous learning opportunities for employees. Training and development 

programs cover a wide variety of topics to equip its employees with the relevant knowledge and skill sets to achieve goals such as 

higher productivity, efficiency, and workplace harmony and also health and safety, human rights and sustainability-related topics.

Succession Planning

Senior management currently comprises a large number of expatriates who provides skills and expertise that would otherwise not 

be readily available in Myanmar. A key KPI of these managers is to appoint a local replacement to their position within five years. 

Meeting this KPI involves the planned and coordinated transfer of knowledge to local staff, which provides unique opportunities to 

the Group’s local employees based on their individual performance, and regardless of gender, religion, or cultural identity. To support

these activities, the Group has also established partnerships with private institutions such as the Global Institute For Tomorrow 

(“GIFT”) and the Singapore Institute of Management (“SIM”) to develop high impact training courses for the development of its future 

leaders.

The Group’s employees have achieved a total of 44,638 training hours in FP2020, with each employee attending an average 

of 8.5 hours of training. The Group initially fell short of its FY2020 target of 40,650 hours. However, the target was achieved in 

6M-Sept2020 as more online training were delivered since May 2020. The number of local managers in the Group has increased to 

397 as at 30 September 2020, which is 13% higher compared to 31 March 2019.

OUR TARGET (FY2021)

DIVERSITY &amp; EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

GRI 405-1, GRI 406-1

OUR APPROACH

The Group recognises that employees are the foundation of its businesses and believes that a strong workforce will provide a better 

foundation to capitalise on the emerging opportunities in Myanmar. By nurturing their individual talents and providing them with 

opportunities for personal growth and career development, Yoma Strategic is helping its employees realise their full potential. As 

an organisation, the Group sees itself as a catalyst to empower its people to perform at their best. Yoma Strategic is committed to a 

working environment that is free of discrimination of any kind. As a committed nation-builder, the Group believes that it has to lead 

by example and ensure that internationally recognised best practices are established early in Myanmar’s development process. The 

Group is a founding member of the Business Coalition for Gender Equality (“BCGE”) and strives to be a role model in this area.

Board Diversity Pledge

The Board welcomes the push for greater diversity in the boardroom which can provide a more diverse approach to business 

decision making. The Company had, on 28 August 2015, supported the Board Diversity Pledge initiated by Singapore Institute of 

Directors and SGX-ST where the Company pledged its commitment to promoting diversity as a key attribute of a well-functioning 

and effective Board. It believes that a diverse Board will enhance decision making by harnessing the variety of skills, industry and 

business experiences, gender, age, ethnicity and culture, geographical background and nationalities, tenure of service, and other 

distinguishing qualities of the members of the Board.

Merit-Based Employment

Merit-based employment means that all Group's employees are given the same level of opportunities to succeed, regardless of their 

background. The Group understands the importance of giving its people autonomy and room to grow, both as individuals and as 

valued employees. As such, fulfilling careers are planned for and built upon the numerous opportunities constantly being generated 

within the Group.

 



The Group will continue to employ, empower and promote 

local and internal talent, as well as adapting exist training 

programmes to prepare its workforce for the upcoming 

digitalisation of its businesses.



To achieve 12 hours  

of training per employee in FY2021.


SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

OUR PEOPLE

OUR PERFORMANCE 

Currently, Yoma Strategic’s workforce consists of more than 29 nationalities as well as a large and growing number of returnees. 

Female and male representation in the Group is approximately 41% and 59%, respectively. Since the launch of our training program 

“Building and Maintaining a Respectful Workplace” in March 2019, 80% of our managers in the Group have been trained on topics 

such as anti-harassment to date. No incidents of discrimination were recorded during the reporting period.

The Yoma Group’s6 10-member Group Diversity and Inclusion Council, which is chaired by the Head of Human Resources and 

includes nine members of the Yoma Group6 Executive Committee, focuses on the following initiatives:

• 

Building Leaders - The Leading the Yoma Way Program is developed to build future leadership capability. This 6-month program 

is facilitated by senior business leaders of Yoma Group6 and comprises of classroom learning, social learning and project 

learning. 53 employees have graduated from this program since its launch in 2018. 

• 

Policies - The Group uses the Economic Dividend for Gender Equality (“EDGE”)26 certification to assess the Support Services 

group and PHSH Gender policies and practices. Both groups have passed the certification and have action plans in place to 

further address gaps identified.

OUR TARGET (FY2021)

HUMAN RIGHTS &amp; LABOUR MANAGEMENT

GRI 407-1, GRI 408-1, GRI 409-1

OUR APPROACH

Labour management includes basic labour practices such as those described by the International Labour Organisation (“ILO”) that 

includes not hiring child labour or forced labour. This material issue also covers collective bargaining, freedom of association, and 

sub-issues such as a minimum number of weeks’ notice provided to employees prior to significant operational changes.

The Group cares for its people and their welfare. As people will always be a vital resource in the organisation, employees are treated 

fairly and with respect. The Group believes in supporting the development of an organisational structure and culture that promotes 

motivation, performance, mutual respect, trust and transparency. This organisational structure is at the forefront of ethical 

behaviour in Myanmar.

Yoma Strategic is aware of the human rights risks in its operations and supply chain, including risks of child or forced labour, and 

operations and suppliers in which the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining may be at risk. Yoma Strategic 

also conducts training on human rights for new employees and has introduced training on topics such as anti-discrimination and 

workplace bullying.



100% of managers

OUR PEOPLE

OUR PERFORMANCE 

Trade Unions were legalised in Myanmar in 2012 and the Confederation of Trade Unions of Myanmar (“CTUM”) was officially 

recognised in 2015. It is an Umbrella body with various federations. Currently, none of the Yoma Group6 businesses have unions. As 

signatories to the UN Global Compact, Yoma Strategic recognises employees’ right to belong to unions, and it also follows Myanmar 

labour law in this regard. Yoma Strategic does not ask or require its employees to disclose if they are members of CTUM or any other 

Union. 

Yoma Strategic’s Human Rights Policy sets out the Group’s clear stance on Human Rights. This policy is publicly available on Yoma 

Strategic’s website at http://www.yomastrategic.com.

No cases of human rights breaches, violations or complaints were identified nor reported during this reporting period.

OUR TARGET (FY2021)

HEALTH &amp; SAFETY 

GRI 403-2

OUR APPROACH

Providing a healthy and safe work environment for employees, customers, business partners and visitors is one of Yoma Strategic’s 

top priorities. Every employee has a personal responsibility to support this commitment. Employees are obliged to carry out their 

work in a safe manner, without causing harm to themselves or others and to report any potentially unsafe or unhealthy situations 

immediately. They must observe and follow all safety and environmental regulations laid down in the operations instructions, 

including putting on the necessary safety equipment, where applicable.

Any health and safety accidents or incidents as well as occupational health &amp; safety inspections, food safety inspections and health 

cases of the Group are registered according to the type of case, and incident. These are consolidated into a monthly report and 

reviewed by Risk Management and Assurance, as part of the overall risk assessment process. 

OUR PERFORMANCE 

The Group achieved a total of 39,372 hours of health and safety training in 12M-Mar2020 compared to 27,162 hours in FY2019 across 

the business segments of Yoma Land, Yoma Motors and Investments. This is approximately 45% more training hours compared to 

FY2019 and exceeded its 12M-Mar2020 target by 5%. The total health and safety training hours achieved for FP2020 is 60,810 hours. 

Despite the Group’s efforts to ensure a safe working environment for its employees, the injury rate for 12M-Mar2020 was an average 

of 1.0227 while the lost day rate for 12M-Mar2020 was 7.5928. It was an improvement from the FY2019 injury rate of 1.263 and lost day 

rate of 8.28 and the Group will continue to strengthen its efforts in promoting safe work practices across the sites. 

For the 6M-Sept2020 period, injury rate and lost day rate were 1.13 and 3.41 respectively.

Pun Hlaing Hospitals is licensed by the Ministry of Health and Sports to carry out COVID-19 testing and is also able to treat 

COVID-19 patients. All employees of Yoma Group6 with COVID-19 symptoms are recommended to be tested at Pun Hlaing 

Hospitals. The cost of the test is covered under the Yoma Family Healthcare programme. Studies have shown that the COVID-19 

pandemic can take a toll on a person’s emotional, mental and interpersonal wellbeing. The Group is providing support for 

its employees who may need help to cope with various issues ranging from economic impact of COVID-19, to stress from 

telecommuting and social relationships affected by COVID-19. Employees can make an appointment to speak with Pun Hlaing 

Hospitals’ psychologist either in person or through teleconsultation.

OUR COMMUNITY 

The Group gives back to the community through its financial 

contributions and voluntary work. In FP2020, the Group's 

employees collectively achieved 11,592 hours of volunteer work 

and the Group contributed approximately US$165,000 for social 

causes which included the following programs and initiatives.

The Fight Against Malaria

Various Yoma Group6 companies are partners of M2030. M2030 

is a movement launched by the Asia Pacific Leaders Malaria 

Alliance (APLMA) to eliminate malaria in Asia by 2030. The 

existing M2030 partners include Pun Hlaing Siloam Hospitals, 

Wave Money, Volkswagen, New Holland, JCB, KFC, Auntie 

Anne’s, YKKO, Little Sheep Hotpot and Yoma Micro Power. Funds 

are raised annually for the M2030 campaign which support 

malaria elimination programs implemented by the Population 

Services International Myanmar, one of the leading non-profit 

organisations fighting malaria in the country.

Fund Raising from the annual Yoma Yangon International Marathon

The annual Yoma Yangon International Marathon (“YYIM”), 

which is co-organised by Yoma Strategic, FMI and Yangon City 

Development Committee, saw more than 11,000 local and 

international runners taking part in its 8th edition in January 

2020. The funds raised from this marathon contributed to five 

key projects to improve the welfare and education of the children 

in Myanmar. With the theme of “Run for Children”, the proceeds 

of the YYIM2020 fundraising efforts were donated to 5 charity 

groups. They are: (i) YCDC Non-Profit Child Day Care Center 

for Low Income Citizens, (ii) Myanmar Red Cross Society, (iii) 

Institute of Sports and Education, (iv) M2030, and (v) Jump! 

BEAM Youth Development Programme 

Step-In Step-Up program

Yoma Group6 supports Step-in Step-up, a Vocational Training 

Association based in Hlaing Thar Yar Township. Step-in Step-up’s 

primary focus is on making a difference to the lives of the young 

and vulnerable.

With its livelihood tailored training, Step-in Step-up focuses on 

preparing local youth for entry level jobs. To date, Step-in Step-

up has delivered and sourced employment for over 200 men and 

women from the age of 18 and up. Of that number, up to 93% of 

the candidates who completed the training to date have been 

successful in securing long term employment. Up to 85% of the 

graduates continue to maintain their position up to 12 months 

later. Finally, 6% of the candidates have been inspired to return 

to school or embark on a course to further their education.

During their training, Step-in Step-up interns work in the 

important frontline positions at Pun Hlaing Hospital, F&amp;B and 

Housekeeping at Awei Metta and Pun Hlaing Estate. Interns 

also volunteered at the quarantine centres within Daing Su and 

Nyaung Villages.

Yoma Group6 Covid-19 initiatives

When the Covid-19 stay home notice was issued, Wave Money 

and Yoma Bank supported Step-in Step-up by ordering masks 

which were sewn by interns who learnt this new skill while 

‘working from home’. More than 20,000 masks were made and 

distributed by Step-in Step-up interns and associated NGOs.

In conjunction with Yoma Bank, Step-in Step-up donated care 

packages consisting of medical, healthcare and food supplies to 

Daing Su and Nyaung villages in Hlaing Thar Yar Township. The 

donation yielded direct benefits to over 11,000 individuals, most 

of whom are hand-to-mouth workers and unemployed due to 

the pandemic.

Along with other donations, Yoma Group6 donated a tonne of 

chicken to Step-in Step-up which were distributed throughout 

the Village Communities reaching more than 25,000 people.
