The Board of Directors (the “Board”) is

pleased

to

present

the

inaugural

sustainability report of UG Healthcare for

the financial year ended 30 June 2018.

Since our inception as a small rubber glove

manufacturer in the late 1980s, we have

grown prudently and are committed to

producing premium quality gloves to cater

for our customers in diverse industries to

fulfill

their

professional

responsibilities

safely. We seized opportunities to expand

progressively in our product range and

manufacturing capabilities and capacity, as

well as broaden our global distribution

network

through

building

our

own

distribution presence in both developed

and developing countries over the years. In

addition to our upstream manufacturing

and downstream distribution operations, we

also

cultivate

our

proprietary

brands,

particularly the “Unigloves” brand.

We place significant emphasis on quality

control and production standards during

our production processes. As a testament

to our commitment to the production of

premium

quality

examination

glove

products,

we

are

certified

to

the

internationally recognised standards of ISO

9001 and ISO 13485. We have also been

certified by the Malaysia Rubber Board to

produce

Standard

Malaysian

Glove

for

export.

Our

products

also

conform

to

various

international standards and requirements

including the ASTM International (formerly

known as American Society for Testing and

Materials), EN455 (European standard for

medical gloves) and Acceptance Quality

Level requirements under the Food and

Drug Administration (“USFDA”). Consistent

product

quality,

ability

to

comply

with

various

stringent

international

standards

and on-the-ground customers service and

technical support to our end-users in each

local market, strengthen mutual trust and

retain many of our longstanding customers.

The

management

team’s

conscientious

effort

in

building

these

three

pillars

(manufacturing, distribution network, and

proprietary brands) concurrently over the

past decades saw the Group grow from

strength to strength, setting new record in

revenue year after year. While we continue

to grow and pursue business opportunities,

we

acknowledge

the

need

for

our

stakeholders

to

be

engaged

in

our

sustainable

growth

strategies

and

practices. We have conducted our first

materiality analysis in 2018 and identified

focus areas which are material to our

Group

and

our

stakeholders.

As

we

continue our sustainability journey, we look

to improve our disclosures over time on the

Group’s economic, environmental, social

and governance (“EESG”) practices as well

as to progressively include metrics and

targets that are material to our businesses,

providing more insights in our subsequent

sustainability reports.

This is UG Healthcare’s inaugural annual

sustainability report and is meant for our

employees, business partners, all other

stakeholders and the interested public. This

report

provides

an

overview

of

our

responsible business practices and has

been

prepared

with

reference

to

the

guidelines of Global Reporting Initiative

(“GRI”) and the Rules 711A and 711B of

the SGX-ST’s Listing Manual Section B:

Rules of Catalist as well as the SGX-ST’s

Sustainability Reporting Guide.

This report focuses on UG Healthcare’s

sustainability performance with regards to

the

Group’s

upstream

manufacturing

operations in Seremban, Malaysia from 1

July 2017 to 30 June 2018.

We intend to expand the scope of our

report in the future to also include our

downstream distribution operations in the

countries where the Group has a presence.

While we have been maintaining data and

information

with

regards

to

our

manufacturing

operations,

we

are

establishing the baseline for most of the

material topics that we have identified as

priorities.

We

intend

to

monitor

and

compare them in the subsequent reports,

and with that, identify and set measurable

sustainability targets.

No external assurance was sought for this

report.

We welcome stakeholders to provide us

with feedback and suggestions on this

report. You may contact us through our

investor relations email at ir@ughcc.com.

directed

by

the

senior

focused

on

generating

stable

and

sustainable value for our stakeholders by

managing the EESG impacts, as well as

risks

and

opportunities

present

in

our

businesses.

The Group has in place a Sustainability

Committee

which

is

led

by

key

management executives and supported by

representatives from various departments

in the Group. The Sustainability Committee

is responsible for reviewing the company’s

sustainability performance, material topics,

stakeholder concerns, setting of targets

and

goals

for

material

and

establishing

systems

to

collect,

meets

at

once

a

year

and

proposes,

coordinates and promotes the company’s

main sustainability initiatives.

The Board approves the Group’s general

policies

and

strategies,

including

those

relating

to

sustainability.

It

may

not

delegate this function. It also approves the

sustainability report.

The

Committee

is

also

regularly

updated

with

reports

on

the

progress

of

the

Group’s

sustainability

efforts.

To better align our efforts with our long-

term

strategy,

we

have

identified

our

sustainability

focus

areas

with

relevant

material EESG factors, which are detailed

This year was the first time UG Healthcare conducted a materiality analysis with internal

stakeholders to identify the social, environmental and governance issues that were most

relevant to the Group. This coincides with our initiative to participate in Sedex Members

Ethical Trade Audit (“SMETA”) to complement with our Quality Management System that

has been implemented group-wide since the late 1990s.

This process helps to define the contents of the report and the general sustainability

agenda. This systematic analysis process took into consideration:

•

Analysis of regulatory frameworks in the countries where we operate

•

Materiality analysis of other similar companies in this industry

•

Reporting frameworks (GRI Standards)

The material topics below show the most relevant concerns for UG Healthcare that were

identified in the internal materiality analysis. Given that this is our inaugural report, we

have just embarked on data collection for these material topics and would be sharing

more information on performance and targets in our subsequent reports.



Economic 

Performance

Financial 

Performance

The Group believes that our growth as well as our

environmental,

social

and

governance

factors

are

interconnected. The Sustainability Report tells only part

of our story and the complemented piece is our 2018

Annual Report which was published on SGXNET on 9

October 2018.

Our financial performance can be found on the following

sections in our 2018 Annual Report:

•

Financial Highlights and Performance Review

(pages 10 – 13)

•

Financial

Statements

and

Notes

to

Financial

Statements

(pages 46 – 94)



Compliance

Socioeconomic 

Compliance

Corporate 

Governance

The Group is committed to uphold high standards of

corporate

governance

and

regulatory

compliance,

ensuring

the

sustainability

of

our

businesses

and

safeguarding our stakeholders’ interests and value for

the long term.

We complied with the principles and guidelines set out

in the Code of Corporate Governance 2012, where

appropriate. Our corporate governance report can be

found on pages 17 – 36 of the 2018 Annual Report.

As we plan to also engage our other groups of stakeholders to better understand their

materiality concerns, the material topics may in the future reflect other issues which we

have not previously considered.



Building Our 

Customer 

Success

Customer 

Management

The Group believes the success of our businesses is

inherently

intertwined

with

the

success

of

our

customers.

We are committed to empathise with the glove users on

their

requirements

and

applications

for

single-use

gloves

in

their

respective

industries.

Through

our

innovative range of glove products, we seek to play a

part in our customers’ successes.

Occupational 

Health and Safety

Forced or 

Compulsory 

Labour



Care for Our 

Employees

organisation. We believe Human Capital management

is essential to increase the values of our employees

who contribute to the success of our businesses.
