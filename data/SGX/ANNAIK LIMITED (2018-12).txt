drive our sustainability initiatives 

forward so as to balance economic 

prosperity with Corporate Social 

Responsibility together.

About AnnAik

Ann Aik Pte Ltd (Registration no: 

197702066M) was incorporated in 

Singapore on 24 September 1977 and 

commenced operations as a stockist 

and distributor of general hardware 

products with a staff size of three in a 

rented shop house.

In the early 1980s, Ann Aik Pte Ltd 

made a strategic move to specialise 

in the sale and distribution of stainless 

steel products due to less competition 

and higher profit margin. In 1989, 

the Company was appointed as an 

exclusive distributor of stainless steel 

butt-weld pipe fittings by a Japanese 

manufacturer. The Company also 

distributes and sells other stainless steel 

piping products, such as pipes, flanges, 

valves and fittings. Currently, the 

Company has approximately 10,000 

different items stored in its Singapore 

warehouse to enable it to be one-stop 

supply centre for customers sourcing 

for stainless steel piping products.

On 4 September 2003, Ann Aik Pte Ltd  

was listed on the Singapore Stock 

Exchange and changed its name to 

AnnAik Limited. The successful listing  

of the Company’s shares marks a 

significant milestone in its corporate 

history.

Over the years, the Company has 

been strengthening its business and 

in early 2000s, it expanded upstream 

into manufacturing of steel forged 

flanges in PRC. Today, the Company 

has one plant in Malaysia which 

manufactures stainless steel and 

carbon steel forged flanges. The

Company has also ventured into 

environmental business in 2005 

by securing contracts to build 

wastewater treatment plants in PRC. 

Today, the Company has seven 

wastewater treatment plants in PRC 

under Build-Own-Transfer (“BOT”) or 

Build-Own-Operate (“BOO”) concept 

and one portable water supply 

company. In 2010, the Company set 

up an environmental technology and 

engineering company in Singapore 

to undertake consulting services 

in water resource management 

for governmental and commercial 

operators. In 2015, the Company also 

ventured into the construction and 

supply of rural wastewater treatment 

equipment in PRC to further enhance 

its environmental and engineering 

division.

Our company business can be segregated into three main divisions:

Our Vision

Code of Conduct &amp; Ethics

To be a global leader in stainless 

steel piping products, known 

for our outstanding quality 

and unique upstream and 

downstream capabilities, from 

manufacturing to distribution to 

engineering construction and 

environmental business.

The Group’s Code of Conduct 

(“Code”), comprising internal corporate 

governance practices, policy 

statements and standards, serves as  

a guide to all its employees and 

officers for both legal compliance  

and appropriate ethical conduct.

Accessible to Board members and 

employees of the Group as well 

as its agents, representatives and 

consultants, the principles and 

standards in the Code are intended 

to enhance investor confidence and 

rapport, and to ensure that decision-

making is ethically and properly carried 

out in the best interests of the Group. 

The Code is reviewed from time to time 

and updated to reflect changes to the 

existing systems or the environment  

in which the Group operates.

The Code sets out principles to 

guide employees in carrying out 

their duties and responsibilities to 

the highest standards of personal 

and corporate integrity when dealing 

with fellow employees; customers; 

competitors; suppliers; government 

agencies and officials; and the 

community in general. Among 

others, key areas covered by the 

Code include workplace health 

and safety; workplace and business 

conduct; safeguarding of assets 

of the Group and other parties; 

handling of confidential information 

and trading policy; conflict of 

interest; personal data obligations; 

and compliance with laws including 

a whistle blowing policy.

The Group has developed 

compliance education as part of 

the regular education programmes 

it administers. Under these 

programmes, employees are briefed 

on this Code and other compliance-

related issues, either on its own 

or with the support of corporate 

function departments.

Supply Chain Management

Governance Structure

Our major suppliers are the 

manufacturers of our Stainless Steel 

Distribution Business. Our suppliers 

are selected based on, amongst 

others, experience, expertise, product 

quality and past performances.

We have a Procurement Policy 

and ISO standard in place which 

provides procurement guidelines 

such as selection and evaluation of 

suppliers as well as ensuring adequate 

diversification of suppliers which 

results in cost-effectiveness and 

prevention of operational disruptions.

Sustainability Governance is led by 

the Board of Directors and supported 

by all levels of the Group.

Sustainability is a journey. The 

Board, with the assistance of Audit 

Committee, will ensure that we 

have the right policies and practices 

in place, with appropriate targets 

and measurements developed, and 

sufficient resources dedicated to 

sustainability-related initiatives. We 

will progressively strengthen the 

sustainability governance structure 

so that there is clear accountability 

and oversight.

We generally do not enter into 

long term exclusive agreements 

with any of our suppliers as we 

value the flexibility to evaluate and 

select our suppliers in accordance 

with our aforementioned criteria.

Our Directors believe that our 

business and profitability are not 

materially dependent on any 

industrial, commercial or financial 

contract with any supplier and will 

not be materially affected by the 

loss of any single supplier.

Risk Management

The Group ensures that a rigorous 

procedure is in place to adequately 

and effectively manage risks faced 

by its business divisions during 

the course of daily operations 

and long-term business planning. 

This is done by holding regular 

Senior Management meetings on a 

regular basis and including Board of 

Directors as required.

On a quarterly basis, the Senior 

Management will provide updates 

to the Board in areas of concern, if 

any, that may arise in relation to the 

Group’s key risks factors.

In addition, the Group has also 

requested its internal auditors, 

to take such risk factors into 

consideration when drawing up the 

annual internal audit plan, so as to 

review and monitor the identified 

risk areas. In the event that the 

Group intends to enter into any 

new markets, business venture or 

business sector, the Group may 

also appoint external professional 

parties to review or advise on 

additional areas of risk factors to 

consider in connection with such 

forays.

In order to ensure that it stays current 

and in compliance with applicable 

and relevant law and standards and/

or requirements issued by regulators, 

the Group tracks regulatory 

developments on a regular basis.

The Group’s Company Secretary, 

Corporate Lawyer and Sponsor 

advises the Board on changes in 

legal and regulatory issues while its 

external auditors provide changes in 

accounting standards to management 

for their consideration. The Group 

has engaged its external auditors 

to conduct at least one briefing per 

annum for the Board on changes in 

accounting standards.

To better manage compliance risk 

oversight, the Audit Committee has 

requested its internal auditors to 

assist the Management in evaluating 

and assessing the effectiveness of 

internal controls implemented by the 

Company to identify risks of non-

compliance in various areas. As part 



of its human resource practices, the 

Group ensures employee benefits 

are in place and healthcare insurance 

is taken out for eligible employees. 

Overall compensation and benefits 

structure also follows closely to the 

basic requirements at the Ministry of 

Manpower (“MOM”), and the Group 

keeps itself abreast through regular 

updates from MOM.

Whistle Blowing Policy

The Company has implemented 

relevant procedures, as approved by 

the Audit Committee and adopted 

by the Board, for the purposes of 

handling complaints, concerns or 

issues relating to activities or affairs 

of the business, customers, suppliers, 

partners or associates, activities or 

affairs of the Group or conduct of any 

employee, officer or Management 

of the Group. Staff of the Group 

has access to the Audit Committee 

Chairman and may, in confidence 

and on an anonymous basis, raise 

concerns about possible improprieties 

in any such corporate matters by 

sending an email or a letter in writing 

to the Audit Committee Chairman.

Operational Risk

Operational risks are managed on 

an ongoing basis. As the Group’s 

business is generally space-intensive 

by nature, the Group’s supply chain 

management is handled by the 

adequate sourcing of accredited 

suppliers as well as regular and 

effective management planning of 

its inventory stock and costs.

As part of its human resource efforts 

to add quality people to its workforce 

and retain its valued employees, the 

Group has implemented training 

and developed rigorous health and 

safety management programmes. 

The Group also provides highly 

incentivised working benefits which 

include insurance, medical and 

dental coverage.

The Group also has a robust Sales, 

Marketing and Communication 

strategy in place to ensure its 

message to stakeholders are aligned 

and it delivers on its sales targets. To 

achieve this, it has a sales strategy 

based on regular management 

review and communication with 

customers.

The Group monitors customer 

satisfaction upon conclusion of 

projects. The Group actively seeks 

to reduce its operational impact on 

the environment, and has stringent 

corporate responsibility and 

sustainability practices to manage 

its industrial waste by recycling 

and reusing where possible and 

engaging licensed waste collectors. 

To safeguard its legal interests, the 

Group hires professionals such as 

lawyers to provide professional 

advice in relation to operational risks.

For continuous operations, the 

Group’s IT infrastructure is handled 

by IT professionals to ensure system 

reliability compliant with stringent 

security measures to prevent 

information leaks or losses. In 

addition, the Group’s inventories are 

protected by adequate insurance 

covering all industrial risks in 

addition to its utilisation of on-site 

security device.





Sustainability Report 2018

Financial Risk

To mitigate its liquidity risks, the 

Group employs a tight capital 

management system to ensure it has 

sufficient working capital to meet 

debt obligations and pays close 

attention to critical financial ratios 

such as inventory turnover, accounts 

receivable/payable, gearing and 

current ratio for the early detection of 

red flags. Information on the Group’s 

Key Performance Indicators and ratios 

are reported quarterly to the Board.

To remain resilient amidst changing 

and increasingly diverse customer 

demands and an uncertain global 

economy, the Group constantly 

keeps itself abreast of market 

conditions, and stays close to its 

customers through regular visits 

and tracking of their purchasing 

patterns. This is to ensure right 

stock inventories are kept and is 

relevant to its existing and potential 

customers.



The Group also has a stringent credit 

policy that covers credit evaluation, 

approval and monitoring, as a 

safeguard to minimise all credit risks. 

In anticipation of unforeseen financial 

losses, the Group adopts hedging 

policies and is insured in relation to the 

following: workmen compensation; 

product liability; directors and 

executive officers’ liability; industrial 

risks; marine insurance; vehicles 

insurance; trade credit insurance; as 

well as travel, health and personal 

accidents insurance for the Group.

Materiality Assessment

The Board has been fully involved in 

the identification and prioritisation 

of material topics and has provided 

resources to manage the governance 

of sustainability.

We conducted a high-level 

benchmarking exercise on a universe 

of topics to shortlist the key topics 

where our company created 

significant economic, environmental 

and social impacts. We took into 

consideration the material topics 

and future challenges of our industry 

as identified by our peers and 

competitors. This include relevant 

laws, regulations and international 

agreements of strategic significance 

to our Group.

Material Topic

Material Factor

Economic

Economic Performance

Social

Diversity and equal opportunity

Employment 

Training and education

Local communities

Environmental

Energy consumption

Recycling, Reuse and Reduce

Our material issues are identified 

based on the significance of 

economic, environmental, social 

impacts and the degree of influence 

they have on stakeholder assessments 

and decisions. We develop our 

material topics through stakeholder 

feedback, new trends in sustainability, 

challenges facing the industries, 

experts’ views and our own business 

goals. We therefore focus our 

sustainability efforts and reporting on 

these issues.

The Group currently does not have 

any quantitative targets on each of the 

identified factors. Notwithstanding  

the same, the Group will formulate a 

target for the respective factors in the 

next sustainability report.

Environmental Protection

ENVIRONMENTAL

AnnAik conducts business in 

a manner that respects the 

environment by minimising the 

Group’s carbon footprint, reducing 

its consumption of resources and 

expanding its recycling initiatives. 

The Management has started to put 

in place best practices to support 

vendors that are eco-friendly rather 

than purely basing on initiatives that 

generate savings to the Group. 

Energy Consumption 

The Group has implemented various 

good practices to reduce energy 

consumption in Singapore office and 

warehouse as follows.

1. Old electronic equipment are 

replaced with equipment that are 

energy saving and environmental 

friendly

2. All staff are reminded to switch 

off lighting, air conditioner and 

other electrical appliances when 

not in use

3. Reminders to set air conditioning 

at certain temperature to reduce 

energy consumption

In the future, we are looking to 

implement additional initiatives to 

minimise our energy consumption.

In order to achieve continuous 

improvement in our environmental 

goals, AnnAik’s commitments are as 

follows.

1. Only “Green” vendor and restaurant 

are used for any corporate event 

requiring food and beverages

2. Reduce paper usage by using 

recycled paper for internal 

purposes, implementing paperless 

working environment e.g. 

e-invoices and e-statements to 

customer.

3. All stationery used are from eco-

friendly brand or from certified 

environmentally friendly vendor 

such as Environmental Quality 

Partner, Singapore Green Label 

&amp; FSC certified, and Programme 

for the Endorsement of Forest 

Certification.

4. Any waste paper, scrap metal and 

old electronics equipment will be 

collected and sent to recycling 

company.
