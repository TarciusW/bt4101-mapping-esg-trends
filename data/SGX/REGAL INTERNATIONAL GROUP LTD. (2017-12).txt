Sustainability Report 2017 

Overview of Report 

Regal International Group Ltd. (“RIG” or the “Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, the 

“Group”) is pleased to present its first Sustainability Report covering its sustainability 

performance in the financial year ended 31 December 2017 (“FY2017”). Our approach to 

sustainability is guided by the Company’s mission to create sustainable values for our 

stakeholders.  

This Sustainability Report aims to inform our stakeholders of our sustainability efforts and 

performance using a structured approach guided by the Global Reporting Initiative 

Sustainability Reporting Standards (“GRI Standards”), by reporting the key material aspects of 

sustainability as well as the Company’s strategies, initiatives and performance in relation to 

environmental, social and governance issues. 

Scope of Report 

RIG’s Sustainability Report will be published on an annual basis starting from FY2017. This report 

covers FY2017 from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.  

This report aims to provide a balanced and reasonable representation of the sustainability 

performance of RIG. All the information and statistics are in relations to the Group’s operations 

unless stated otherwise. All information and data are not verified by third party. Internal data 

monitoring and verification relied on to ensure accuracy. 

Reporting Process 

With FY2017 being the first year of issuing Sustainability Report, RIG engaged an external 

consultant to facilitate the sustainability reporting process and to advise on the industry 

leading practices on sustainability reporting. RIG’s Sustainability Reporting Committee (the “SR 

Committee”) consists of the Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO”), the Communications and 

Business Development Manager, and the management staff of each core business function.  

Headed by the CEO, the SR Committee directed the preparation of the report. The 

management staff collected the information necessary for this report from the various 

departments they each are responsible for. Overall, this process was coordinated by the 

Communications and Business Development Manager. The Group aspires to improve this 

process continually to ensure that our strategy is well integrated across all our business 

functions. 

Reporting Guidelines 

This report has been prepared based on GRI Standards. “Core Option” has been adopted for 

“General Disclosure” as this is the first time that RIG issues a sustainability report. The Group will 

consider adopting “Comprehensive Option”, which has more items to disclose, as and when 

the option is appropriate in the future.

Regal International Group Ltd. 

Sustainability Report 2017 

Message from the Board 

Over the past 13 years, the Group has maintained its consistency in constructing, completing 

and marketing a range of property development projects, mainly in East Malaysia, laying the 

groundwork for more successful years ahead. 

Paving the way to a sustainable future 

RIG has been dedicated to excel in everything we do, and at every level. As a Company, we 

understood the importance of not only considering the top-down, but also the bottom-up, 

and of considering stakeholders’ goals from every angle, from economic performance to 

social and environmental efforts. 

Achievements 

RIG has achieved commendable success in the Built Environment Industry. From a small 

building construction and property development company, the Group now owns a diverse 

property portfolio that includes shop houses, landed residential properties, condominiums, 

commercial and industrial units.  

On the 26 October 2017, representing RIG, our Group CEO, Mr. Su Chung Jye was conferred 

the prestigious Built Environment Industry (BEI) Asia Distinguished award at the BEI Asia Awards 

2017 Ceremony. The award acknowledged that the Group has demonstrated excellence in 

business while incorporating best business practices such as corporate social responsibility 

through sustainable efforts.  

Forward Strategy 

RIG adopts a strategy of product innovation and value chain creation to ultimately heighten 

demands and broaden its customer base. The Group is constantly on the lookout to enhance 

its development projects through value-added services and innovative real estate 

applications. 

Leveraging on RIG’s unique position as the gateway for international investors into Sarawak, 

the Group explores strategic ventures and collaboration opportunities in alignment with its 

vision and evolves as cross-border platform connector between investors from Singapore, 

Malaysia and China. 

Propelling ahead, RIG is confident that these strategies will enable the Group to attain its 

business success as a value-added builder developer that integrates real estate products with 

complementary business ventures of sustainable growth, keeping in mind its goal of integrating 

sustainability in its new projects. 

Social Program Initiatives 

We believe in giving back to the society and contributing to the general social well-being. 

Annually, the Company will conduct a Chinese New Year charity red packet handouts in 

Kuching, Sarawak, to as many as over 550 members from various welfare associations. In 

addition, the Group also organized Sarawak Children’s Cancer Society (SCCS) Charity Movie 

outings and participated in fund-raising food fairs organized by The Salvation Army for the less 

privileged.

Engaging Stakeholders 

 

Lastly, RIG believes in actively engaging its stakeholders in its sustainability journey. We would 

not be able to achieve any of this without the help of the people who work with us and for us. 

Our shareholders, investors, customers, employees, suppliers, contractors and the community 

all contribute to the success.  

 

We thank each of you for the support you have given us so far, and we look forward to 

collaborating and partnering with you as we continue our journey to a sustainable future. Your 

steadfast support has been a constant source of comfort and will be an impetus to drive us 

forward to achieve even more. 

 

RIG is confident that these strategies will enable the Group to attain its business success as a 

builder developer that integrates real estate products with complementary business ventures 

of sustainable growth.

Strategic Update 

Fundamental Beliefs 

RIG’s core corporate philosophy of “Happiness for You and Me” denotes creation of happiness 

and mutual well-being of the Company, staff as well as the public community.  

Initiated more than 12 years ago, RIG has been accumulating small deeds of kindness along 

the way by making positive contribution to society with the aim of creating and increasing 

awareness of the less fortunate groups in Malaysia so that more people will volunteer to help 

them. Our motto ‘Developing Sustainably for Everyone’ guides our business decisions when it 

comes to developing properties, keeping all stakeholders in mind. 

Commitment 

RIG is committed towards supporting communities and charitable organisations where it 

operates and cultivating employees with compassion. Seeds of empathy and kindness were 

planted along the way as the Group believes in giving back to the society and contributing 

to the general social well-being through the execution of development projects and the 

management of its operations. 

The Group partakes in food fairs and donation drives organised by registered charitable 

organisations in Kuching, Sarawak on a regular basis.  

On the 31 August 2017, Regal’s charity team participated in a fund-raising food fair organised 

by the Salvation Army, a charity association providing residential homes for children and 

elderly, family support services, refugee help and emergency relief services at the Salvation 

Army Kuching Boys’ Home.  

Apart from fund raising, the Group had organised a charity movie outing on 19 August 2017 

for Sarawak Children’s Cancer Society (SCCS). This event has brought about 100 participants 

from 16 families together. The Group hopes that this small initiative could provide some form 

of support and comfort to those who are fighting a strong battle against cancer. 

Earlier this year, the Group, together with NIIT College also presented a cheque of RM10,000 

to Chung Hua Middle School No.3, providing financial aid and supporting the educational 

environment for the youths. 

The Group also joined the Sarawak Housing and Real Estate Developer Association (SHEDA) 

with the aim of contributing to the creation of a developed and more prosperous nation and 





Movie outing with Sarawak Children’s Cancer Society (SCCS).

remained committed to pursuing a partnership with the Government, businesses and the 

public towards achieving quality living.  

 

As a sustainable property developer, RIG is committed to manage its supply chain across the 

whole life cycle of the project from its initiation and design development stages to subsequent 

construction and execution stages. This allows the Group to effectively manage its consultants, 

main contractors and subcontractors, as well as diverse services, materials and equipment 

required to deliver large-scale developments in a complex supply chain environment. 

 

 

 

 

 

In selecting its main contractors for projects in Malaysia, contractors are assessed under 

stringent criteria. These include track record, financial strength as well as commitments 

towards high quality, environmental and safety standards.  

 

Goals and Achievement 

 

With the aim of creating happiness for its staff and the community, as well as to develop our 

properties sustainably, RIG aspires to be the bridging gateway and platform for international 

partners and investors to access the abundant emerging business opportunities in East 

Malaysia. The Group focuses on East Malaysia as core market, and at the same time scaling 

up our presence in the other regions of Malaysia.

Regal International Group Ltd. 

Sustainability Report 2017 

About The Company 

Corporate Profile 

RIG is one of the first Sarawak-based companies to list on the mainboard of the SGX and is 

dual-listed on the mainboard of Singapore Exchange – Securities Trading Limited (“SGX”) 

(Stock code: UV1.SI) and as Taiwan Depository Receipts (TDR) on Taiwan Stock Exchange 

Corporation (“TWSE”) (Stock code: 911619.TW). 

Over the past 13 years, RIG has achieved an impressive track record of constructing and 

completing a range of property development projects in Kuching and Kota Samaraban areas 

in East Malaysia. This diverse property portfolio includes shop houses, landed residential 

properties, condominiums, commercial and industrial units. The Group has in recent years 

added Nilai (Negeri Sembilan, West Malaysia) and Bintulu (Sarawak, East Malaysia) to the 

geographical coverage of its property division.  

Our Singapore registered office is located at 63 Sungei Kadut Loop #02-01, Singapore 729484. 

Our East Malaysia office is at 1st Floor, S/L 39, Lot 672, Block 14 MTLD, Kuching/ Samarahan 

Expressway, 94300 Kota Samarahan, Sarawak, Malaysia. 

The Group engaged businesses in property development, investment and construction. All 

these are carried out by the associated Group of subsidiaries under RIG’s direct subsidiary, 

Regal International Holdings Pte. Ltd. Besides, Temasek Regal Capital Sdn. Bhd., a wholly 

owned subsidiary under Regal International Holdings Pte. Ltd., is also the Malaysian investment 

holding Company that brings together over 20 other subsidiaries and associated companies 

involved in property development and other related business activities. 

The Group’s main activities focus on property development and construction. Building on our 

strong pipeline of property projects, the Group further progresses strategically to manufacture 

its own building materials and develop ancillary services. Joint venture companies involved in 

supplying concrete, painting works and steel fabrication have also been established to realize 

better cost, quality and delivery controls to ensure sustainability. 

On 11 January 2017, the Group’s subsidiary, Temasek Regal Capital Sdn. Bhd. signed an 

agreement with Koperasi Jayadiri Malaysia Berhad (“KOJADI”) for the issuance of RM15 million 

worth of Redeemable Preference Shares with guaranteed cumulative dividend for the tenure 

of 3.5 years. The partnership with KOJADI shows a strong confidence in the Group’s focus on 

building up property development and related investment gateway business.  

Environmental and Social Impacts 

RIG’s diverse property portfolio includes a mixture of shop houses, landed residential 

properties, condominiums, commercial and industrial units, offering an array of shopping, 

dining, business and entertainment options. 

In 2016 and 2017, the Group completed phases of two mini-township projects, namely the 

Tondong Heights and Airtrollis. Both properties were constructed along the city outskirt area 

(20 - 30 minutes’ drive from city) of Kuching and Sepang to create new affordable residential 

township.  


 





7 

Regal International Group Ltd. 

Sustainability Report 2017 

 

Comprises of 11 blocks of 10-storey apartments, the Airtrollis offers a total of 1112 residential, 

commercial units and retail units. Residential units are between 820 to 970 square feet, priced 

reasonably and appropriately for the lower to middle income group. 

 

Tondong Heights is divided into three phases that comprises of 228 single-storey and double-

storey terrace houses. Houses and communities carved out of what used to be deserted rural 

lands to provide for the forming of new mini-township where residential, commercial and 

possible educational activities could prevail.   

 

Consequently, the development of these two property projects not only fulfil the need for more 

affordable housing, job opportunities for those living in the community were also created.  In 

addition, property development requires an increase in transportation and trade services that 

can benefit a local economy. The new construction in the areas is often accompanied by 

infrastructure improvements such as paved roads and better sewer lines, making it attractive 

to new residents and industries.  

 

The Airtrollis project boast plans to redevelop the surrounding area of Nilai to become a more 

vibrant community. This development would also bring greater connectivity to its residents with 

its proximity to an integrated transport system, boosting both tourism and economic 

opportunities.  

 

Similar holds true with Tondong Heights as well. 

 

Furthermore, the agreement with MyAngkasa Bina Sdn. Bhd. (“ANGKASA”) for the sale of all 

residential apartments to be built for Airtrollis phase 3 provided the Group with upfront security 

and assurance in residential units which would further lower financial and developmental risks 

for the Group.

Our employees are the driving force behind our sustained growth. The Group strongly believes 

in the importance of employee engagement, talent acquisition and retention. Our HR policies 

and initiatives are geared towards building a conducive workplace for our employees’ 

development and well-being. This increases our employees’ productivity and satisfaction,

In addition, the Group also recognizes that the contractors and sub-contractors at our 

construction sites are key resources to the long-term viability of our business. While they may 

not operate directly within our immediate realm of influence, this did not prevent us from being 

a strong advocate of health and safety across our value chain.

At RIG, we see human capital as one of the Group’s most valuable resources. It is crucial to 

develop competent, capable and motivated workforce that can meet the business

Employee Benefits (cont’d) 

 

As a statutory requirement from Singapore government, RIG is required to make Central 

Provident Fund (“CPF”) contributions to our staff employed under the subsidiaries in Singapore 

who are Singapore citizens or permanent residents of Singapore based on the monthly rate 

stated in the CPF Act. Under this defined contribution plan, both the employee and employer 

will have to make contributions on a monthly basis, building up the employee’s retirement fund 

for the future.   

 

Similarly, for our staff employed under the subsidiaries in Malaysia, there is also a government-

management retirement saving scheme, Employees Provident Fund (“EPF”), which provides 

retirement benefits for those who contribute.

Parental Leaves 

 

RIG supports the government’s pro-family policies with regards to parental leave. 10 

employees (8 females and 3 males) have taken parental leaves in FY2017.  

 

Looking back into FY2016, 6 female employees who had taken parental leaves remained 

employed by the Group one year after returning to work. Having such entitlements will further 

enhance the morale and sense of belonging of our employees as they are grateful for the 

essential supports given to them.

Training &amp; Development 

 

RIG regards employees as the foundation of our Group and strives to develop our employees 

to their fullest potential. Employees are required to attend various trainings to keep them 

abreast with the latest technology and work skills.  

 

All our employees are given abundant development opportunities across the Group, 

regardless of age, gender or position to develop their professional and managerial skills 

through various exposure, such as on the job training or external training programs whenever 

possible.  

 

Total hours of staff 

training in 2017 

552 hours 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All new joined employees are also required to attend a compulsory training program aiming 

to help them in understanding the Group’s culture and adapt to our environment easily. We 

believe that these investments are therefore necessary for us to succeed.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In addition, 100% of our people, including non-managerial and managerial staff, have gone 

through performance evaluation and career development reviews on a bi-annual basis. 

Regular appraisal of employee performance aids the personal development of individual 

employees. It also contributes to skills management and to the development of human capital 

within the organization. Regular performance and career development reviews can enhance 

employee satisfaction, which correlates with improved organizational performance.

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 

 

The Group has been supporting the local communities, welfare associations for the 

underprivileged and educational institutions through participation in food fairs, charity run 

events and donation drives on a regular basis. The Group believes in sharing our love, warmth 

and joy with the underprivileged Groups by organizing activities such as movie outings, charity 

lunches and charity giving.  

 

In March 2017, the Group, together with 

NIIT College presented a cheque of 

RM10,000 to Chung Hua Middle School 

No.3, 

providing 

financial 

aid 

and 

supporting the upgrading of school 

facilities for the youths. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Group organized a movie time for the 

children at Sarawak Children’s Cancer 

Society (SCCS) in August 2017 and raised 

funds for Sarawak Cheshire Home. The Group 

hopes that such outing would create 

bonding opportunities with their families and 

bring comfort to them as they continue to 

fight the battle against cancer. 

  

In December 2017, the Group also organized a Christmas 

charity lunch for the children at the Salvation Army to 

celebrate this joyous occasion with them.  

 

 

 

 

 

The Group believes strongly in planting seeds of kindness and cultivating employees with 

compassion. Therefore, RIG highly recommends all its employees to participate in various 

events, including the “Into the Woods Hash Run 2017” to raise funds for public education in 

Kuching. Through the execution of its CSR activities, RIG hopes to bring everyone closer to one 

another and advocates empathy for each other.
