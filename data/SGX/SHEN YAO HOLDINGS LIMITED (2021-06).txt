Sustainability Report 2021

Shen Yao Holdings Limited

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is both deep and 

widespread, affecting many countries and industries 

around the globe. At Shen Yao, we are focused on 

protecting our employees, contractors, customers, 

investors and supporting the communities in which we 

operate.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, in demonstrating 

our solidarity and work with the relevant authorities 

in controlling the spread of COVID-19, we established a 

dedicated team to ensure adherence with the relevant 

COVID-19 regulations and guidelines implemented by the 

authorities as well as to oversee the health and safety 

of our employees and contractors. The Group has been 

vigilantly complying with the directives of the government 

in the relevant jurisdictions in which it operates. 

We continue to conduct our businesses responsibly and to 

integrate sustainability into our operations to achieve the 

best possible outcomes for all our stakeholders. We value 

diversity and inclusion and bring together people from 

around the globe. We are working towards making Shen 

Yao an employer of choice and building an organization 

with a culture that focuses on the well-being of employees 

and also one that fosters personal growth, collaboration 

and open communication. 

We actively engage with our stakeholders, including 

customers, investors, communities and regulators, to foster 

mutual understanding and trust. 

In FY2021, the Group continues to adopt the Global 

Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) reporting framework in 

our sustainability reporting. Meanwhile, we commit 

our support to the UN 2030 agenda-17 Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs) as part of our commitment 

towards making continued progress on our sustainable 

development journey. 

Whether we are facing a COVID-19 pandemic outbreak or 

recovering sustainably and resiliently from a COVID-19 

pandemic, we are with our stakeholders and communities 

through thick and thin.

Thank you for these efforts, and I look forward to 

achieving success together as we continue to develop our 

sustainability efforts.

Shen Yao engaged Virtus Assure Pte. Ltd. to work with 

the Company to develop a questionnaire to identify the 

EESG factors that the Company considers important to its 

stakeholders, the details of which are set out on page 10 

of this report.

GPG has regular and ongoing interactions with various 

stakeholder groups, and the nature of such engagement 

varies for different groups. 

These stakeholders include external and internal parties. 

External stakeholders include individuals or entities such 

as shareholders of Shen Yao, goods and services providers, 

government regulators and neighbouring communities in 

the vicinity in which GPG operates.

To identify the stakeholders that needed to be engaged 

to determine the EESG factors to be reported upon, 

consideration was given to parties that could be expected 

to be extensively affected by Shen Yao’s activities or could 

affect the Company’s ability to carry out its business.

The mining industry is well established in Australia and there 

is an extensive support network of suppliers that cater to the 

needs of the industry.

GPG and its operating subsidiary, Balmaine Gold 

Pty Ltd, have entered into supply contracts with a 

wide range of suppliers to provide utilities, services 

and consumables.

Items such as explosives, ground support 

consumables, fuel, mechanical supplies, electricity 

and gas and other goods and services used in the 

mining operations are supplied to us under long 

term contracts. Appropriate commercial contract 

review and tender processes are followed to ensure 

that the best value for money is obtained and that 

products and services that are fit for purpose are 

sourced with reliable supply arrangements.

The London-based Risk Advisory Group published 

their Corruption Challenges Index 2020 in March 

2020. The index lists Denmark as the jurisdiction 

least challenged by corruption in the world, 

closely followed by New Zealand, Australia, United 

Kingdom, Finland and Singapore. While all the 

necessary security measures are taken to prevent 

fraud and error, our operations in Australia are not 

unduly challenged by corruption.

During the financial year, GPG dealt with 598 

(FY2020: 626) suppliers with the top ten accounting 

for 46% (FY2020: 52%) of total expenditure. GPG 

has a policy to support local suppliers in the 

Ballarat region or the state of Victoria where 

possible, although some of the specialist materials 

and services are sourced from the traditional 

mining states of Western Australia and Queensland 

as they are not available within the state of 

Victoria. 

SUPPLY CHAIN 



GPG’s total expenditure for FY2021 amounted to 

approximately A$67 million (FY2020: A$82 million) 

of which A$30 million (FY2020: A$29 million) 

was expended on labour and the remaining A$37 

million (FY2020: A$53 million) was spent on goods 

and services.  GPG contributes approximately 

A$50 million (FY2020: A$62 million) annually to 

the economy of the state of Victoria in the form of 

salaries and goods and services. 

Australia has extensive and rigorous industrial and 

health and safety laws to ensure that individual 

suppliers maintain appropriate practices to 

safeguard workers. These laws and policies cover 

the occupational health and well-being of not only 

the employees of GPG, but also the individuals 

working across GPG’s supply chain.

During the reporting period there has been no 

significant changes to operations of GPG or its 

supply chain. Operations have continued as in the 

past and while the Company operates in a dynamic 

business environment and may have moved from 

one supplier to another for strategic or economic 

reasons, such changes have not been significant. 

Gold ore produced by the site is forwarded to 

an Australian refiner for smelting and further 

refinement in accordance with the London Bullion 

Market Association standards and Australian 

Law. The refined gold bullion is then purchased 

by the Australian refiner for their use locally and 

internationally.

GPG has implemented a wide range of measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 

among our workforce and local communities as well as to keep our operations 

running.  GPG continues to work closely with the Minerals Council of Australia 

(“MCA”), Victoria’s Work Health and Safety regulator, and other Victorian mine 

sites, contractors and suppliers to ensure that all government directives and 

MCA protocols have been implemented.

Measures and controls that are being applied in GPG include:

• 

Temperature screening &amp; verbal health declarations on arrival.

• 

Increase in number of handwashing &amp; sanitising stations.

• 

Safe distancing on site and during team meetings.

• 

The mandatory wearing of face masks.

• 

Separation of teams.

• 

Cancellation of non-essential visits to site.

• 

Advisory signages and staff information sessions.

• 

Allowing support staff to work from home if possible.

• 

Continued mental health support.

• 

Removal of communal items from kitchens.

• 

Introduction of extra cleaning including use of virucidal disinfectant.

• 

Additional awareness sessions held for all employees.

•

During the year, GPG, in conjunction 

with the Ballarat Tram Way Museum, 

formed an agreement to donate 

labour for their offsite storage facility 

that was being built in-between 

one of the Victorian Government 

prescribed lockdowns. This is one 

example of GPG’s contribution to the 

wider Ballarat community.



In the last year, GPG continued to 

expand its apprenticeship program, 

encouraging locals who share the 

same passion and values to consider 

Ballarat Gold Mine as a starting 

point for their careers. In addition, 

we are continually trying to recruit 

skilled labour. However, GPG still

website also allows GPG to provide 

the latest blast vibration information 

for concerned residents.

Unfortunately, due to the continued 

lockdowns, several educational 

student visits to the mine site had 

to be cancelled. In past years, these 

education visits by various student 

bodies have formed a key component 

of the Group’s engagement strategy 

with the wider community. However, 

it is safe to assume that as Australia 

charts its way out of the pandemic in 

line with higher vaccination uptake 

rates, these events will eventually 

resume.

Although it has been another tough 

year for many companies in the state 

of Victoria, the Ballarat Gold Mine has 

been fortunate enough to be able to 

maintain our production and mining 

capacity, and along with this we have 

been looking to support the locals in 

the community by maintaining our 

employee numbers at around 220 

as well as to continue working with 

over 100 contractors that all work on 

site. In the last year, apprentices were 

also placed following a partnership 

between the Ballarat Gold Mine and 

Ballarat Group Training, an entity that 

GPG continues to navigate its way through the 



pandemic successfully, even as periodic lockdowns 



and restrictions are enforced upon our operations due 



to community transmission being identified within 



the state of Victoria. Despite this, GPG has continued 



its efforts in engaging with its stakeholders, which 



has been made possible with the use of technology, 



allowing GPG to communicate meaningfully with key 



stakeholders and the wider community by way of the

RELEVANT SDGs

We are committed to operating our business in a safe 



and responsible manner to prevent occupational 



injuries and illness to all our employees, contractors 



and the community we interact with.



Occupational Health &amp; Safety has been treated with the utmost importance 

since the inception of our mining and exploration activities.

The Company recognises that our safety record has an impact on our social 

standing and acceptance in the community and on the decisions of both our 

internal and external stakeholders. Moreover, safety regulations governing our 

operations and our commitment to remain compliant with such regulations 

ensure that high standards of safety are achieved, and our workers’ well-being 

is catered for.

The Topic Boundary for this important EESG factor is the workplace of all GPG 

employees. This is primarily within the perimeter of the Ballarat Gold Mine but 

also covers the regional exploration work sites.

The Company has taken a number of steps to ensure that Occupational 

Health &amp; Safety is managed proactively and consistently with diligence and 

commitment by everybody at all levels of the organisation. The Occupational 

Health &amp; Safety Policy shown below is a cornerstone of the Board and Senior 

Management’s approach to safety.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 



The GPG Health &amp; Safety Management System, depicted in the diagram below, is 



the central framework to achieving the above policy objectives.



Health &amp; Safety Management System is divided into 15 elements.

The elements are further separated into 4 categories:

1.  Commit

2.  Plan

3.  Do

4.  Check &amp; Act


Sustainability Report 2021

Shen Yao Holdings Limited

019

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

The intent behind and the performance requirements of each element provide 



goals that should be achieved for the system to work effectively in the present and 



to also achieve continuous improvement for the future. The management team 



sets targets for achievements annually which include lead and lag indicators.



Lead indicators are measurements of the extent that 

actions that are intended to pre-emptively manage 

hazards and prevent incidents and injuries are actually 

completed. Examples are number of audits completed, 

number of safety meetings held, safety training completed, 

safety assessments completed etc.. Lag indicators include 

total recordable injuries, number of hazards identified 

in incident investigations that were not identified in the 

safety assessments, number of safety incidents and injury 

frequency rates.

Overall, our target for the next year is to continue to 

proactively manage Occupational Health &amp; Safety risks to 

reduce the number and severity of work-related injuries 

and ill health.

The operation of the Health &amp; Safety Management System 

and ancillary activities are described in more detail below.

GPG is committed to ensuring that its Health &amp; Safety 

Management System:

• 

Improves overall health and safety performance,

• 

Is appropriate for GPG operations,

• 

Integrates with other systems and core processes,

• 

Enables GPG to meet its legal obligations, and

• 

Meets the requirements of the GPG Occupational Health 

&amp; Safety Policy.

The GPG Health &amp; Safety Management System has been 

implemented to adhere to the requirements of the 

Victorian Occupational Health &amp; Safety Act 2004 and 

Regulations 2017 (the “Regulations”). 

Crucially, Part 5.3 of the Regulations requires the operator 

of a prescribed mine to establish and implement a safety 

management system which provides a comprehensive 

and integrated management system for all risk control 

measures and is used as the primary means of ensuring 

the safe operation of the mine.

Scheduled audits of the GPG Health &amp; Safety Management 

System are completed by an independent organisation to 

comply with the Regulations, which require the operator 

of a prescribed mine to review and, if necessary, revise 

the safety management system at least once every three 

years.

Elements of the GPG Health &amp; Safety Management System 

are audited by the Victorian Health &amp; Safety Regulator 

(the “Regulator”) as part of the annual Major Mine Hazard 

Verification Audit. The scope of the audit and the elements 

assessed vary from year to year. The 2021 Verification 

Audit was conducted in February 2021 with a focus on 

Ground Failure, Fire Underground and Vehicles.

The GPG Health &amp; Safety Management System has been 

developed and implemented based on the guidelines 

published in the following Australian/New Zealand 

Standards:

• 

AS/NZS 4804:2001 Occupational health and safety 

management systems – General guidelines on 

principles, systems and supporting techniques

• 

AS/NSZ 4801:2001 Occupational health and safety 

management systems – Specifications and guidance 

An Occupational Health &amp; Management System has been implemented 

and provides a framework for the continual improvement of health 

and safety measures and processes for all employees, contractors and 

visitors across all GPG operations and activities.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

All employees, contractors and visitors are encouraged to 

actively identify hazards and reduce risks associated with 

all GPG activities without fear of victimisation or reprisals. 

Site personnel are instructed in the use of GPG Hazard and 

Risk Management tools upon induction and during periodic 

refresher training and are encouraged to stop and seek 

assistance if a task cannot be completed safely.

Hazards are routinely identified through a range of 

activities such as major mine hazard safety assessments, 

workplace inspections, environmental monitoring of the 

workplace, audits, risk assessments, job safety analysis, 

management of change workshops, and site safety 

meetings. 

Identified hazards are recorded and ranked according 

to risk potential using GPG Hazard report forms and the 

GPG Risk Assessment Matrix. Corrective actions are then 

assigned to each hazard utilising the Hierarchy of Controls 

to reduce the hazard as far as is reasonably practicable 

where the risks cannot be eliminated.

When unfortunate incidents resulting in injury, damage or 

loss occur, they are investigated using the Incident Cause 

Analysis Method. The basic cause and contributing factors 

are identified and, where appropriate, corrective actions 

are assigned to prevent recurrence.

Identified hazards, reported incidents and allocated 

corrective actions are recorded into the site safety 

database (the “INX-InControl”) and tracked through to 

completion. In FY2021, GPG implemented INX-InControl, 

a cloud-based Health &amp; Safety software solution for the 

reporting, tracking and closeout of hazards, incidents and 

corrective actions. The INX-InControl software enables 

real time reporting of hazards and incidents and with 

the incorporation of tablet technology, removes the 

administrative burden of the paper-based system.  

Hazards, incidents, and corrective actions are routinely 

discussed as an agenda item during site safety meetings 

and reported in weekly and monthly reports. Such 

reports are circulated internally to relevant individuals 

or department heads so as to keep them apprised of such 

matters and to allow for them to follow up on any action 

items if any.

Escalation workflows exist within INX-InControl to ensure 

the timely closeout of all actions raised from hazards, 

incidents, inspections and audits. 

Hazard and Risk Management is an integral part of the GPG Health &amp; 

Safety Management System. Proactively identifying and mitigating 

potential risks and hazards is an effective way to ensure a safe 

workplace.

Medical and health assessments are conducted before and 

during employment to ensure employees are fit to perform 

the inherent requirements of their role and to monitor 

workplace related health effects. 

Workers’ personal health related information remains 

strictly confidential and is secured both digitally and 

physically on site with restricted access.

Ergonomic assessments of workstations and tasks 

are undertaken as required and, where appropriate, 

adjustments are made to reduce the likelihood of injury or 

aggravation.

GPG conducts scheduled health monitoring for known 

occupational health risks including exposure to silica, 

diesel particulate matter, lead, mercury and arsenic. Health 

monitoring results are provided to all personnel via letters, 

site notice boards and reports. In addition to national 

exposure standards published by Safe Work Australia, 

the statutory agency established to improve work health 

and safety in Australia, GPG has established action levels 

for health hazards, i.e. when an exposure approaches a 

specified level below the exposure standard, action will be 

taken to reduce exposure through the application of risk 

control measures. 

GPG offers all employees free access to a weekly on-

site soft tissue clinic for the treatment of work-related 

and non-work-related injuries or physical complaints. A 

registered medical practitioner attends the on-site clinic 

and is available to employees during work hours. Where 

appointments relating to work-related injuries cannot be 

scheduled at the on-site soft tissue centre, appointments 

are arranged during work hours for employees at an 

external registered health clinic. Employees consent to 

allow the provider to discuss relevant health information 

and other personal information concerning identified 

health conditions or injuries with relevant and authorised 

site personnel such as their manager or Health &amp; Safety 

personnel. Personal health related information is retained 

offsite by the external providers and provided to Health 

&amp; Safety personnel where appropriate to aid with 

rehabilitation and recovery.

Fit for Role assessments are scheduled for employees 

whose medical examinations indicate a decline in their 

fitness for role. Assessments are conducted by an external 

health &amp; wellbeing consultant and participants were

provided with advice regarding blood glucose, cholesterol, 

blood pressure and body mass index. An individual plan 

was developed for each participant to assist in improving 

their fitness for role.

GPG provides surface-based employees with free annual 

skin cancer checks run by an external medical practitioner. 

Results are strictly confidential and are shared only with 

the employee and their general practitioner. The checks 

were last provided in December 2020.

Flu vaccinations are provided to GPG employees and 

long-term contractor employees as part of the COVID-19 

preventative controls on site. 

GPG is committed to operating in a safe and responsible manner so as 

to prevent occupational injury and illness.

Consultation and communication on health &amp; safety 

matters take place via several formal forums including 

safety meetings, pre-shift meetings, management of 

change workshops, notice boards, health and wellbeing 

presentations and through employee participation in risk 

assessments, procedure reviews, incident investigations 

and workplace inspections.

Employees and contractors are involved in the 

development, implementation and review of processes 

used for hazard identification, hazard/risk assessment 

and control of hazards/risks. Safe work practices and 

procedures are developed in conjunction with the 

personnel required to use them.

Worker consultation and communication has been further 

enhanced with the implementation of a site Health &amp; 

Safety Representatives (the “HSR”) program. HSRs are 

elected by their peers and utilised on-site to conduct 

safety meetings and participate in procedure reviews, risk 

assessments, workplace inspections and other site health 

&amp; safety functions. All elected representatives attend a 

five-day regulator-approved training course and undergo 

annual refresher training.

Ensuring that all employees, contractors 

and visitors are appropriately trained and 

competent in performing their relevant duties is 

a fundamental component of the GPG Health &amp; 

Safety Management System.

Each role within GPG is assessed for the necessary 

competencies and skills, utilising formal competency-based 

assessment.

 

Training is delivered by trained and competent personnel 

and, where applicable, contains both theory and practical 

components to assess competency.

Customised induction programmes which commensurate 

with the level of risk involved in a particular employment 

role are prepared and conducted upon commencement of 

employment with GPG. The same applies to contractors 

and visitors to GPG sites. Inductions cover relevant health 

&amp; safety risks, hazards, controls, behaviours, company 

objectives, policy, systems and procedures. GPG utilises 

INX – InTuition to ensure that competency assessments 

and training records are maintained and ongoing, and that 

periodic refresher training is provided.

Where major mine hazard safety assessments identify 

competency levels as a critical control, competency 

assurance forms part of the overall critical control 

assurance &amp; verification process.

All training and competency assessments are carried 

out by persons with appropriate knowledge, skills and 

experience. All records of training, qualifications and 

competencies are maintained with confidentiality.

GPG implemented INX-InTuition, a cloud-based training 

and competency software solution in September 2020. 

INX-InTuition streamlines spreadsheet and paper-based 

systems and allows for real time reporting and analysis of 

on-site training programs. 

GPG strives to maintain effective consultation 

and communication between all levels of the 

organisational structure in a manner that ensures 

that employees and contractors feel empowered 

to participate in maintaining a healthy, safe and 

enjoyable workplace with a positive culture.

In addition to mental health counselling services, the EAP 

provides assistance to employees for a range of topics 

including nutrition, sleep, resilience, mindfulness and 

addictive behaviours. 

The EAP is a free and confidential service facilitated by an 

external provider via face-to-face meetings or telehealth 

calls. The services offered as part of the EAP are promoted 

regularly in inductions, site safety meetings, health and 

wellbeing sessions and via site notice boards. All services 

are strictly confidential with all workers’ personal health 

related information retained offsite by the external 

providers. 

Monthly health and wellbeing topics are presented to 

GPG employees and contractors by the Health, Safety and 

Wellbeing Coordinator. Topics presented include mental 

health awareness, sleeping tips, coping with fatigue, stress 

&amp; recovery and nutrition.

GPG employees and contractors participate in daily 

pre-shift injury prevention exercises. The exercises are 

prescribed by a qualified group exercise trainer and 

are updated on a monthly basis. Exercises focus on 

strengthening and conditioning key areas of the body with 

the aim of reducing injuries.

A mental health education program was presented to all 

site employees by an external mental health consultant. 

The aim of the program is to reduce stigma associated 

with mental health conditions and to empower site 

personnel to actively seek help when needed. 

GPG has an on-site fitness centre with exercise equipment 

designed to promote the health benefits of daily exercise. 

The fitness centre is available for use by GPG employees 

before, during and after work.  An expansion of the fitness 

centre has been planned for fiscal year 2022 to allow for 

weight training in conjunction with cardio training. 

A fit for role program has been introduced to address the 

declining physical fitness for role in identified employees.  

Periodical medical assessments are undertaken for 

individuals in high injury risk roles to identify those who 

need to improve their physical condition.  The employee is 

then assessed by an occupational rehabilitation provider 

and a personalised program is developed to assist the 

employee in reducing his/her injury risk profile.

GPG offers all employees and their immediate family members access to the 

Employee Assistance Program (the “EAP”).

Through our ongoing efforts in continuous training 

and process improvement, we did not record any high-

consequence work-related injuries or fatalities in FY2021. 

We will continue this process while working to translate 

commitment into better day-to-day safety practices. As 

compared to FY2020, the number of recordable work-

related injuries (excluding fatalities) decreased by 9, despite 

a considerable increase in total hours worked in FY2021. 

We have a perpetual target of zero cases of work-related 

injuries and fatalities and is committed to working towards 

achieving this target.   

The various initiative of injury prevention on-site, including 

Training and Education, Soft Tissue Clinic and external 

Health and Well-being providers has contributed to the 

decrease in the injury frequency rate. Proper safeguards 

are put in place to prevent inappropriate access and use 

of any machinery or equipment which could result in the 

occurrence of any potential injury. The effectiveness of 

these programmes is being closely monitored and will be 

assessed on an ongoing basis.

RELEVANT SDGs

The mining industry in Australia is 



extensively regulated and there are 



numerous local, State and Federal 



legislation that govern mining and 



associated activities.



In addition, GPG also needs to comply with the conditions 

of its approved mining plan and the terms and provisions 

attached to our various mining and exploration tenements.

The main sources of legislation that govern our activities 

in respect of the Compliance with Licence Conditions and 

Community Relations ESG factors is the Mineral Resources 

(Sustainable Development) (the “MRSD”) Act 1990 and 

MRSD Regulations 2013.

On 30 March 2020, the Victorian Environment Protection 

Authority (the “EPA”) released a draft guidance on the 

scope and purpose of new operating licences and for the 

licence holders, addressing the new general environmental 

duty (the “GED”). The Environment Protection Act 2017 

came into effect on 1 July 2021. It gives the EPA more 

powers and tools to prevent risks to the environment and 

human health. They also allow the EPA to issue stronger 

sanctions to hold polluters to account. 

The GED is a centerpiece of the new laws. It requires 

all Victorians to manage risks to human health and the 

environment that are created as a result of their actions. 

Everyone must take steps to prevent or minimise those 

risks. For businesses, this includes correctly managing 

✓

✓

waste or storing chemicals safely. For individuals, this 

includes ensuring waste from renovations are properly 

disposed of or that household chemical are not released 

into stormwater drains. 

In addition to ensuring that all aspects of its operations 

are undertaken in accordance with all relevant legal and 

regulatory requirements, GPG also makes a conscious 

effort to develop and manage community relations.

The EESG factors relating to Compliance to License 

Conditions and Community Relations are closely 

related and are proactively managed together using an 

Environmental Management System pursuant to the 

Environmental Management Plan.

There have been zero non-compliances and one minor 

(Category 5) incident recorded during the reporting period. 

During the year, the Company did not incur any fines or 

non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with laws 

and/or regulations. We have a perpetual target of zero 

cases of incidents and non-compliance with laws and/

or regulations and are committed to working towards 

achieving this target.

GPG is committed to obtaining certification for the 

Ballarat Gold Mine’s Environmental Management Plan 

under the industry standard framework for environmental 

management - ISO14001.  This will provide assurance 

to GPG’s management, employees, as well as external 

stakeholders that environmental impacts are being 

effectively measured and addressed.

GPG has implemented the following policies regarding the environment.



ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION 


Sustainability Report 2021

Shen Yao Holdings Limited

032

GPG has an extensive monitoring network for the 

various environmental and community risks identified 

above. We continue wherever reasonably practicable to 

allay community concerns and ensure our “social and 

environmental impact” is as low as possible. 

GPG has an extensive monitoring program producing 

data sets for both online weather and water monitoring 

at five-minute intervals as well as annual usage of 

energy. We ensure that scarce resources are utilized in an 

environmentally and efficient manner.

Pursuant to licence conditions, environmental monitoring 

results are reported quarterly to the ERC and annually 

to the EPA, the National Pollution Inventory and the 

Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions – Earth 

Resources Regulation. 

ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION 

Operations with Significant Actual and Potential Negative 



Impacts on Local Communities





In addition to the overarching Community Policy, 

the three key goals and objectives for this 

community engagement plan are:

1. To continually improve community 

relationships through positive and constructive 

consultation. 

2. To share information with the community 

about activities undertaken by the operation 

that might affect the community.

3. To allow the community to express their views 

on such activities. 

GPG maintains a close working relationship with all 

statutory authorities to ensure we remain compliant and 

uphold our social contract.

GPG’s established procedures and regular monitoring 

and reporting of environment and community matters, 

as elaborated above, are an effective way of measuring 

and determining the efficacy of the controls being 

implemented. Should a control be identified as being 

ineffective, GPG will then launch an investigation to 

identify the issues and implement corrective actions so as 

to ensure that the site’s standards and licence conditions 

are maintained. The Topic Boundary for these important 

ESG factors extends beyond the operation’s border fence 

to the neighbours and locations where the effects of the 

Company’s activities are evident.

Impact from COVID-19



The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our 

community, with continued lockdowns and restrictions, 

disrupting communication with our neighbours and 

community. We have however conducted several letter-

drops providing updates in relation to our activities, and 

resumed face-to-face meetings in-between prescribed 

lockdowns. It was particularly exciting to be able to 

conduct two of the last three quarterly ERC on site at the 

Ballarat Gold Mine. We also provided the option of online 

participation to cater to members of the community who 

were unable to be physically present. 

We continue to update our website 

https://ballaratgoldmine.com.au/, which is an essential 

portal for communicating with the community through:

• 

The feedback form on the Contact Us page

• 

Dedicated pages to new projects 

• 

An eNews option for communication with a campaign 

to get concerned community to register for this via the 

link on the Contact Us page.

65% of the interactions with community residents for 

the reporting period were regarding vibration and noise 

relating to underground firings (i.e. explosives detonated 

underground to break rock for tunnelling and production 

purposes). A further 18% of community connection focused 

on positive engagement and education for various key 

stakeholders.

Vibration levels are measured as peak particle velocity 

(the “PPV”) which is a measurement of maximum ground 

particle speed.

GPG has been operating well within the two statutory 

limits which stipulates that 95% of all blasts must be 

less than 5 mm per second and never above 10 mm per 

second. 

All blasts continue to be monitored and during the year 

GPG undertook an upgrade of some vibration monitoring 

equipment to further enhance control and monitoring in 

this particular aspect.  There was also a greater emphasis 

placed on working with blast design engineers throughout 

the year to reduce the residual effects of blasting as much 

as is practicable for those living above the mine.

The table below sets out the recorded vibration levels 

compared against the statutory limits.

Examples of how GPG engaged with 

the community includes, but not 

limited to:

• 

Letter-drops for specific projects.

• 

Proactive phone calls and face-to-

face meetings when requested.

• 

Contributions to charitable 

organizations.

• 

Third party blasting reports and 

information sent to interested 

community members.

• 

On-site tours (suspended 

throughout 2020 and 2021 due to 

the COVID-19 pandemic).

ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION 

A solar powered, telemetric vibration monitor installed in May 2021. It allows the 

Environmental and Communication team to rapidly collect data and respond to feedback 

from blasts in the community.


Sustainability Report 2021

GPG has developed risk-based management plans (in 

relation to dust emission, noise pollution, vibration, 

waste-water, water pollution, erosion of sediments, ground 

disturbance, fire, release of hydrocarbon from waste oil 

or diesel spill, security breach etc.) which evaluates the 

identified risks and outline mitigation actions, steps taken 

to reduce the risk, enabling better compliance management 

and timely and informed decision-making. 

All complaints are promptly investigated, and measures 

are taken to manage the effects that gave rise to the 

complaints. Employees working in the Environmental and 

Community team work closely with geologists and blast 

engineers to share information and develop solutions to 

minimize the impact of blasting on residents living above 

the mine site. 

Vibration and noise associated with blasting activity was 

again the prevailing concern for neighbours with 85% of all 

contacts and 93% of complaints relating to GPG’s blasting 

activities. Other complaints related to noise resonating 

from around the waste rock dump and mill, long grass, fire 

prevention, weed control, tree management and rubbish 

dumping over vacant land. 

ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION 

Any blasts which exceed the internal limits is fully 

investigated and notification is provided to the staff 

responsible for preparing the blast. All complaints 

and feedback continue to be welcomed, recorded and 

investigated, and a response was issued when required.

In response to vibration related community feedback, GPG 

continues to undertake vibration monitoring at residents’ 

properties, and provide information about blast vibration 

and license limits. The SMS alert system introduced last 

year has been a success. We are also now able to provide 

information relating the location of the blast (which mining 

compartment the blast will take place in). Several visits 

to residents’ homes were conducted during the period, to 

both educate and listen to residents’ concerns. 

In response to the increase in community complaints 

relating to blast vibration, we have modified our mining 

methods to reduce vibration levels, including but 

not limited to, using low-density explosives, smaller 

multiple firings rather than one large firing and altering 

the duration and pace of the firings. Mining method 

modifications continue to be explored, and GPG have 

consulted with external organizations to ensure current 

industry best practices are employed. 

GPG continues to restrict production blasting times to 

weekday daylight hours between 09:00 and 17:00. GPG 

has also developed internal procedures and increased 

blasting training to ensure that the quality of the 

blast design and setup meets established guidelines. 

Furthermore, GPG has implemented a quality assurance 

system that continuously measures and reviews drilling, 

charging and firing practices to ensure optimal blasting 

results.  

The target for environmental performance and compliance 

with licence conditions is to review and adopt, where 

practicable, industry best practices for new technology and 

methods of work to ensure statutory limits continue to be 

met. Beyond simply complying with these limits, GPG is 

committed to reducing waste and the effects of emissions, 

improve efficiency of natural resources usage such as 

energy and water, and to undertake rehabilitation of the 

environment affected by our activities. 

GPG continues to strive towards improving our 

community relations to maintain the social license to 

operate. Community feedback is a critical measure of our 

performance and forms an integral part of our review and 

monitoring of our operations.

As at 30 June 2021, 74% of GPG employees were covered 

by an Enterprise Agreement and the remaining 26% have 

individual employment contracts.

GPG employed 100 contractors as at 30 June 2021. There 

are three main groups of contractors: 25 were engaged to 

carry out underground exploration drilling, 10 provided 

production drilling services and some ground support 

installation services with the remainder being involved in 

a variety of tasks comprising maintenance works in the 

mine.

As at 30 June 2021, the Group has 231 employees, 13 based in Singapore and 218 involved with mining and exploration 

operations in Victoria, Australia.

Due to the Victorian Government’s intermittent lockdowns 

caused by the current pandemic, GPG has faced a shortage 

of professional skilled employees. This situation is likely 

to prevail until vaccination uptake rate increases within 

Australia. GPG is also planning the introduction of a 

high-performance leadership development program to 

further drive ongoing sustainable performance within the 

organisation. This will help to empower its workforce to 

embrace innovation and new technologies to ensure that 

GPG is at the forefront of driving change in the mining 

industry.

GPG is constantly 



seeking opportunities 



to give back to the 



community beyond 



the economic benefits 



generated from 



operations. As such, 



GPG also contributes to 



the community through 



education projects or 



charitable donations.



This year, despite the COVID-19 lockdowns, GPG continued to make positive 

contributions to the wider community through a series of direct donations and
