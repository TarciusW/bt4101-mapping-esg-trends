THE DRAGON PATTERN

THE BAMBOO SHOOTS PATTERN

This pattern is believed by the Dayak Kutai Tribe (Urang Kutai) to 

symbolize water and the source of life. The Urang Kutai Tribe believe 

that the dragon is the master of water that controls fertility. For 

them, water commands the basic element of life, farming, flora, 

and medicine. The dragon pattern is also believed to bring hope of 

prosperity and armature.

Bamboo shoots or bamboo sprouts are often used as ingredients 

in Southeast Asian cuisines. The Dayak Kutai Tribe (Urang Kutai) 

believes that bamboo shoots represents the endeavors to always 

strive for the better. It is also believed to remind them to be wise 

in life and humble even though life as they reach the highest peak.

Kencana Agri Limited, a publicly listed company in 

the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”) since July 2008, is a 

palm oil plantation business with primary activities 

located in Indonesia. The Group engaged mainly in the 

cultivation of palms oil and processing of Fresh Fruit 

Bunches (FFB). 

In 2019 the Group reached a new milestone by 

commissioning a new mill in Sulawesi Tengah, with 

a capacity of 30MT/hour. The Group now operates 

a total 67,722 hectares of oil palm plantation, both 

nucleus and plasma, which are located in the islands 

of Sumatera, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi with a total of 

6 (six) operational mills. 

Kencana Agri has not fully realized its potential as 37% 

of its oil palm trees are still in the immature and young 

mature stage. This relatively young profile of palm oil 

trees, with a weighted average of 10 (ten) years, will 

soon enter their prime mature phase, driving up the 

potential for strong FFB production growth in the near 

future. 

Our main products are Crude Palm Oil (CPO), Palm 

Kernel (PK), Palm Kernel Cake (PKC) and Crude Palm 

Kernel Oil (CPKO). Kencana currently has 6 (six) palm 

oil mills with total processing capacity of 305 tonnes 

per hour and two kernel crushing plants with capacity 

of 435 tonnes per day.

2019 Sustainability Report




We are pleased to share with you our 2019 Kencana 

Agri Sustainability Report. Our fourth report contains 

updates on our commitment, approach and progress 

towards sustainable business practices. This will include 

achievements made in various critical issues as well as 

a disclosure on the challenges we faced along the way.

This year’s report theme is ‘SIGAP’ which is Bahasa 

Indonesia to describe agility, robustness, effectiveness, 

positivity, and full of spirit. We choose this theme 

because it represents the Group's corporate and 

people culture. As a company, we want the spirit of 

‘SIGAP’ is embedded in everything that we do, from 

how we do business, our operations, to how we engage 

and interact with our stakeholders. Agile in seizing 

business opportunities and in carrying out day-to-

day operations. Fast, robust, and effective in taking 

actions; and maintain positive views and full of spirit 

attitude in everything we do. 

Sustainable Business

We have a strategy with sustainability at its heart 

and I firmly believe it will lead to a better tomorrow. 

Over the last years, we’ve made significant progress 

on our sustainability journey. Yet our approach needs 

to constantly develop, much as the world around us 

is evolving  from increasing expectations of the role 

of business in contributing to the UN Sustainable 

Development Goals..

The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are 

a call for all organizations around the world to take 

action and achieve more sustainable future. This year 

the Group has mapped out several SDGs that have 

been in line with our commitments for the past few 

years, and will continue to be improved in the coming 

years. This will be our first small step towards our 

commitment within SDG.  Out of the 17 (seventeen) 

SDGs, Kencana Agri has prioritized 4 (four) where we 

believe we can make the greatest impact. These four 

SDGs are discussed throughout this report.

Sustainability 

also 

includes 

delivering 

strong 

operational and financial performance.  In 2019, we 

managed a total of 67,722 ha of planted areas within our 

palm oil plantations and 16,136 ha of this total planted 

areas are dedicated for our plasma smallholders. The 

total CPO produced was 187,899 tonnes or 4.7% lower 

compared to 2018 production of 197,149 tonnes. For 

the yield of fresh fruit bunches per hectare in 2019 

reached 14.7ton/Ha.

We have conducted  regular assessments to review 

our compliance with the PROPER, ISCC, and ISPO 

provisions. It is our commitment to maintain ISPO 

certificates at all plantations with mills. In 2019, 

we achieved ISPO certification for PT Agro Inti 

Kencanamas. To date, over 12,126 hectares of 2 (two) 

mills have received ISCC certification. 

We are also vigilant about our environmental 

performance, with no significant environmental 

events reported in any of our operation in 2019. As 

our commitment towards environment, we undertake 

High Conservation Value (HCV) Assessments as well as 

Social and Environmental Impact Assessments for all 

our new development areas. We carried out evaluation 

on habitat quality, soil conditions, peat presence, river 

quality, and community cultural identity. We strive 

to ensure our soil fertility by enabling our oil palms 

to attain their full productive potential, but through 

minimal use of inorganic fertilisers. We recycle all the 

biomass and organic by-products produced in our 

plantations and mills such as EFB and POME and use 

them as organic fertilisers.

Kencana Agri Limited


We are committed to being a responsible employer 

by continuously providing appropriate skills training 

to our employees, understanding their aspirations, 

upholding and protecting their rights, and taking care of 

their welfare by providing a safe working environment. 

We strive to employ local people originating from our 

operational areas to contribute to the growth of the 

local economy through job creation. 

In 2019, our focus is to improve workers conditions 

through several initiatives that will continue to be 

implemented beyond 2019. These initiatives include 

our partnership with Verité and GAR (Golden Agri 

Resources) for a long term strategy to improve our 

workers welfare, building an elementary school, and 

community empowerment program to increase the 

income of our workers. In 2019, we have completed 

the construction of Primary School Project within the 

vicinity of PT. Sawit Kaltim Lestari, which was a part of 

one stretch of estates in Kutai Area

We make safety and health our top priorities and, based 

on the principle that no one must be injured in our 

facilities, spare no effort in making work environments 

as safe as they can be for Group company personnel 

and the personnel of subcontractors. The OHS 

Management System complies with local regulations, 

which includes hazard identification and prevention, 

risk assessment and management, programme 

evaluation and continuous management system 

improvement. We managed to have zero fatality in 

2019. However, we regret to report that we have 2 (two) 

fore incident.

This report focuses on describing how our sustainable 

business model contributes to problem resolution 

and ongoing development for society, and how we 

will continue to pursue our business in coexistence 

with local communities. In 2019, doctorSHARE and 

Kencana Agri collaborated together to celebrate the 

10th anniversary of doctorSHARE in Jakarta. the 

event attracted donors to participate in building and 

strengthening doctorSHARE hence that it will continue 

to help the underprivileged around Indonesia for years 

to come.

Going forward

We remain committed to operating transparently 

and responsibly. We are reflecting this commitment 

through our ambition to integrate sustainability 

throughout every aspect of our business. We recognise 

that we will only achieve this aim through collaborative 

partnerships with all of our stakeholders.

I would like to thank our teams for their commitment 

and demonstrated ability last year to both deliver on 

our short-term commitments—through a balanced 

model of gradually accelerating growth, significant 

margin enhancement and a stronger balance sheet

Kencana Agri places great importance on maintaining 

dialogues with stakeholders and working in ways that 

promote the building of a sustainable society. We 

invite you to read this report and welcome your candid 

feedback on how we can improve in these endeavours. 

Sincerely, 

Chief Executive Officer

Sustainable Operation  

&amp; Products

Palm oil accounts for 35% of the world's vegetable oil 

market. The use of Palm kernel and palm oil are widely 

varied because they can be processed and blended 

to produce a vast range of products with different 

characteristics. Palm oil in many countries is used as a 

simple frying oil, but many other markets make use of 

both palm and palm kernel oil.

Growing 

demand 

coupled 

with 

increasing 

environmental concerns means that to continue to 

be viable, more sustainable production is required. 

Kencana is committed to sustainable palm oil 

production by investing in long-term solutions that 

will create both economic and social benefits, while 

minimising environment damage. 

Indonesia produced 47.1 million tonnes of crude palm 

oil (CPO) last year and 4.6 million tonnes of palm kernel 

oil. By the end of 2019, Indonesia held about 4.6 million 

tonnes of palm oil stockpiles. The production of palm 

oil in Indonesia is predicted to increase until 2020.

Expanding applications of palm oil in both edible and 

non-edible sectors remain the major growth-inducing 

factor for the market. However, the market for palm 

oil in 2019 remains fluctuates. The global production 

of palm oil is expected to grow to around 75.7 million 

metric tons in the marketing year 2019/2020, up from 

approximately 70.5 million metric tons in 2017/2018. In 

that period, Indonesia and Malaysia were the leading 

exporters of palm oil worldwide. (M. Shahbandeh, Jan 

31 2020, Palm oil: global production volume 2012/13-

2019/20, Statista.com)

Market conditions may fluctuate, but our commitment 

to pursue the highest standards of excellence in 

sustainability remains steadfast. We have continued 

to strengthen internal systems to ensure that we live 

up to our commitments and continuously improve our 

performance.  Our ongoing quest to achieve greater 

productivity and yields without compromising on our 

sustainability commitments is central to our business 

approach. 

Customer and Marketplace 

Kencana Agri is committed to delivering the highest 

level of customer satisfaction. As one of suppliers 

for palm oil products, we serve both domestic and 

international markets. The Group is proud to produce 

high quality products for palm oil refiners, traders, 

brokers, oleochemical companies, and fast-moving 

consumer goods companies (FMCG). In 2019, 100% of 

our products was sold in domestic market. [102-6]

We endeavour to accurately understand the unique 

requirement from our buyers by maintaining a close 

relationship and conducting periodic visits. We really 

appreciate the feedback from our customers related 

to our products and services as the foundation to 

achieve sustainability. Moreover, It is our commitment 

to comply with all prevailing regulations regarding 

production, distribution, and traceability. 

Respecting our customers’ privacy is essential to 

maintaining their trust in our business. Managing 

privacy risks effectively is core to our approach. Our 

privacy policies and framework govern how we collect, 

use and manage our customers’ information in order 

to ensure the confidentiality of their personal data and 

communications. 

Customer complaints is one way of communication 

from our customers. We believe that well customer 

complain management may lead to a higher customer 

satisfaction. Throughout 2019, the Group has recorded 

some complaints related to our CPO and kernels from 

customers and marketplace authorities regarding 

our products, marketing communication practices or 

anticompetitive behaviour. All complaints have been 

resolved.

Sustainable Operation

Kencana Agri adopts an innovative and inclusive 

approach to managing operation sustainably for the 

local community, our employees, and the entire value 

chain of the Group. To maintain the success of our 

business, we apply procedures and systems that will 

ensure the implementation of various aspects of our 

sustainability commitments. 

We works to continually improve its our efficiency 

across our supply chain by continually optimising 

the use of our resources including land, soil, water, 

fertilisers, seeds quality, and many more. We want 

to make our operations as efficient as possible using 

fewer resources and generating less waste. 

Supported by the adoption of best practice 

management practice across our production process, 

replanting programs, FFB transportation, better 

tending of our crops to produce higher yields, and 

improvement of soil fertility, has enhanced the 

productivity and effectiveness of our operation

We constantly looking for ways to reduce our carbon 

footprint in our plantation and our daily operations 

through 

continuous 

engineering 

improvement 

programs. Moreover, we strive to adopt best practise 

of water management system and chemical spraying 

system to achieve sustainability.

Soil fertility is the backbone of our business and 

plays a key role in determining our product quality. 

We manage our soil fertility by allowing the organic 

nutrients from biomass waste to be re-utilised as 

natural fertilisers for the soil. Moreover, we use legumes 

cover crops to protect soil integrity, conserve moisture, 

boost nutrients and reduce soil surface runoff. We also 

maintain buffer zones to protect riparian areas and 

water quality.

Kencana has always recognised our responsibility 

towards the our people and local community. Our 

people are our biggest asset, so we are creating an 

environment where everyone feels valued and able 

to contribute their unique skills. We are committed to 

actively involved in making our communities better. It is 

our commitment to help alleviate poverty and improve 

quality of life through economic development, health, 

education and social infrastructure programmes.

Maintaining Product Quality [GRI 416-1] 

Kencana Agri is committed to quality. We ensure 

that the products and services we provide meet or 

exceed our customer's expectations. We comply with 

industry best practices and continually improve the 

effectiveness of our quality management system. We 

have adopted Good Management Practices (“GMP”) 

which reflected within all of our Standard Operating 

Procedures (“SOP”). These include FIFO treatment 

for FFB, maintaining low stockpiles for CPO &amp; kernel, 

ensuring sufficient labour to support harvesting 

rotation, clean condition of collection point (TPH) 

and minimising mill breakdown amongst others, to 

maintain the quality of our FFA. 

In 2019 the Group took great attention on the quality 

of our kernel sold to our customers, as concerns 

in stone content has become on the rise in the last 

couple of years. To mitigate this issue Operations has 

implemented a strict policy where all FFB collection 

point must be provided with sacks to minimize the 

amount of stones to be collected into trucks. 

Sustainable Products &amp; Traceability

The strengthening of Indonesian Sustainable Palm 

Oil Organization (ISPO)  is a real commitment 

from the government and business community in 

Indonesia to build a sustainable oil palm sector. 

Kencana has implemented sustainability strategies 

at our plantations that are in compliance with ISPO 

certification main assessment criteria. ISPO aspects 

that we adopts include: [GRI 102-12]

•	 Environment Management

•	 Responsibility for Workers

•	 Social Responsibility &amp; Economic Environment  

•	 Sustainable Business Improvement 

In carrying our operations, we also implement 

the principles from both ISPO and ISCC within our 

operations. As our commitment, we conduct ISPO 

surveillance audits yearly and re-certification audits 

as required at all estates and companies. We also 

implement at all operation sites PROPER rating – 

environment performance rating by Indonesia’s 

Ministry of Environment and Forestry. We believe 

these initiatives provide competitive advantages in the 

market and help us ensure the quality, responsibility 

and sustainability of our products.

In Kencana Agri, to ensure the implementation of ISCC, 

ISPO and PROPER in our plantation, we  collaborates 

with independent certification bodies, namely SAI 

Global &amp; TUV Nord, and the Ministry of Environment 

and Forestry in conducting regular reviews and 

assessments. In addition, an annual surveillance 

audits are conducted to ensure that ISPO principles 

were implemented thoroughly and properly at all 

plantations. 

As our commitment to implement best practice 

principles towards climate change, we have adopted 

ISCC principles in PT Sawindo Kencana and PT Alamraya 

Kencana mas. ISCC is oriented towards the reduction 

of greenhouse gas emissions, the sustainable use of 

land, the protection of natural biospheres and social 

sustainability. All FFB Products coming and into the 

Company are traceable to any of our stakeholders. Our 

ability to provide product traceability guarantees that 

our CPO and FFB were produced in and by reputable 

sources.

Kencana Agri has achieved Sustainable Palm Oil certification from ISCC for 23.5% 

of our eligible nucleus palm oil plantation area which represents 12,126 hectares 

of plantations that equal to 26,303 tonnes of CSPO, and equivalent to 14.3% of the 

total CPO produced by the group in 2019. This number has dropped significantly 

from 2018 due to a drop in FFB production in PT.AKM, but also from a decision to 

delay PT. AKM’s ISCC re-certification process in 2019.

Emission Reduction and Monitoring 

The Group recognises that climate change can have 

an impact not only on the natural environment and 

vulnerable communities, but also on our business. 

We are dedicated to developing plans that will 

progressively reduce our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 

emissions.  

Kencana calculates net GHG emissions in our 

plantation 

operations, 

mills 

operations 

and 

transportation activities from both subsidiaries which 

were generated from fuel consumption, application of 

fertilizers. We have been able to monitor and calculate 

our GHG emissions from 2 (two) most significant 

operation areas, namely PT Sawindo Kencana and PT 

Alamraya Kencana

Having proper initiatives is essential to ensure that we 

do our part in protecting our planet. Our initiatives to 

improve GHG performance includes:

1. Utilizing biomass as fertilizer and an alternative fuel 

substitute for generators and boilers.  Also  reducing 

emissions from the use of fertilizers and diesel fuel 

in our estate and factories. 

2. Monitoring the use of generators for housing 

electricity. Housings in estates are connected to the 

government grid whenever possible, thus reducing 

emissions from diesel generators. 

3. Monitoring air quality every 6 months within our 

estate and mills area. We report on NOx, CO and SOx 

generated around our plantation and mills. 

Complying with the regulation from the Indonesian 

government, the environmental quality standard 

(Baku Mutu Lingkungan-BML) for NOx, CO and SOx 

values are 400, 30,000 and 900 µg/nm3 respectively. We 

committed to maintain the average of NOx, CO and SOx 

values under the BML. Even though we could maintain 

our GHG on the BML limit, we strive to keep lowering 

our air emissions to the best that we can. 

We calculated our GHG emission from our operation 

according to the Regulation of the Ministry of 

Environment and Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia 

Number 41 Year 1999. In 2019, we managed to reduce 

our GHG emission from the Group’s operation.

We managed to identify, monitor and reduce our 

carbon emissions throughout our operations. We have 

implemented a GHG calculation tool compliant with 

ISCC EU System 205 v.3.0 standard at all our mills and 

their estate supply base from two most significant 

operation areas, namely PT Sawindo Kencana and 

PT Alamraya Kencana Mas. The activities that we 

monitored include GHG emission from plantation 

operations, mills operations and transportation 

activities from both subsidiaries which were generated 

from fuel consumption, application of fertilizers. 

In 2019, our GHG calculation in plantation, mills and 

transportation activities in PT Alam Raya Kencana mas 

was 833.76 kgCO2/dry-ton CPO, while for PT Sawindo 

Kencana GHG calculation for 2019 operation was at 

651.67 kgCO2/dry-ton CPO, which showed 16% decline 

compare to 2018 calculation.

Energy Consumption 

Kencana Agri is committed to making changes in 

our operations to reduce our climate impact. One 

of the ways we’re working toward this commitment 

is striving to reduce emissions by focusing on two 

initiatives regarding energy, which are energy 

consumption reduction and maximising the utilisation 

of alternative energy sources through the use of 

biomass as renewable energy sources. In 2019, 

Kencana managed to minimise the consumption of 

fuels that were previously used for transportation 

vehicles (motorcycles) in our plantation areas to a very 

minimum insignificant volume. [GRI 103-1]

In order to increase energy efficiency ratio in our 

operation, we strives to optimized the quality of the 

FFB produced, hence resulting in a higher percentage 

of utilisation in the mills. In 2019, the average FFB yields 

were 14.7 tonnes (nucleus) and 14.05 tonnes (plasma) 

per hectare, while our Oil Extraction Rate (“OER”) 

was 20.95 %. These OER and FFB yields show that the 

Group’s growth potential is not yet fully realised as 37 % 

of its nucleus oil palms are in the immature and young 

mature stage. This data implies that the Group’s current 

processed FFB derived mostly from 63 % production of 

its prime mature oil palms (nucleus and plasma), which 

amounted to 885,625 tonnes of FFB in 2019. [GRI 103-2] 

Electricity used by our mills are generated from steam 

turbines fueled by kernel shells and leftover fruit fibre. 

Recycling by products not only helps manage input 

costs, but also reduces our carbon footprint.

Throughout the year, our mills were able to produce 

biomass fuel such as fibres and shells amounting to 

166,046 tonnes, or 2,027,817 Gigajoules of energy, 

which is equivalent to 19,125,980 kWh of electricity. In 

comparison to the total 21,134,027 kWh of electricity 

generated, the biomass fuel accounts for 90% of the 

Group's total generated electricity. [GRI 103-3, GRI 302-1] 

Note: The total volume conversion of biomass usage to GJ is multiplied by the Net Calorie Value.  

Net Calorie Value can be obtained from our laboratory sample test results at Sucofindo Laboratory in 2009.

Water Usage

Clean water is critical to sustain all kinds of life form on 

Earth. In rural areas with thousands of local residents 

are dependent on water supplies from lakes and rivers. 

Moreover, maintaining a clean and uninterrupted 

supply of water constitutes one of the most critical 

components in sustainable palm oil production. 

As an agribusiness, water is crucial not only for the 

maintenance of our crops but also in other areas of 

our operations such as the well-being of our workers 

and to generate steam for processing. We adopt best 

water management practices to ensure the efficient 

use of water. We implement Triple R programmes, as 

well as the installation and integration of wastewater 

treatment systems with our overall waste management. 

The objectives are to maximise the utilisation of 

wastewater from our operations and to be able to 

discharge it back to water bodies responsibly. [GRI103-

1, GRI 103-2] 

We developed our water management system with 

comprehensive hydrology, agronomy, and topography 

studies which enable accurate control and monitoring 

of water flow. Kencana also puts into consideration 

on environmental conservation aspects. Moreover, we 

conducted assessment on social impact of our system. 

Further evaluation has been done on the effectiveness 

and impact on our water management system started 

from the construction phase.  The Group use computer 

software modelling and simulation of the system, thus 

aiding the Group in designing an optimal system for 

each particular area. [GRI 103-2]

All the water used for our milling operations is 

withdrawn from rivers and we do not use groundwater. 

Throughout 2019, the Group withdrew a total of 

1,360,323 m3 of water from nearby reservoirs and rivers 

in our estates for mill processing. Most of the reservoirs 

we use sourced from rainwater. The water consumption 

intensity based on 2019 total water consumption was 

1,60 m3 of water per ton of CPO produced. Total water 

usage by the Group consists of 85% from reservoirs 

and the remaining 15% from rivers surrounding our 

estate areas. [GRI 303-1]

Various initiatives has been conducted to ensure water 

conservation by maintaining optimal water condition, 

thereby creating an ideal environment for palm oil 

cultivation. Our water management system aims to 

prevent flooding, minimise erosion, and to secure 

the water supply for our plantation areas during the 

dry season. Moreover, we also developed Watergate 

system in low lying areas, terracing system, and cover

Grievance  

Kencana has a grievance mechanism in line with our Sustainability Policy. A robust grievance procedure 

has been put in place to resolve all verifiable complaint and conflicts with all parties in our supply chain. 

The grievance mechanism is very important because it benefits open and inclusive dialogue with our 

stakeholders.

In 2019 there was one grievance filed to one of our estates, PT Sawit Kaltim Lestari (SKL) with regards to 

allegation on environmental pollution to a river in Desa Sabintulung, Kecamatan Muara Kaman. The 

allegation was first reported to Department of Environment and Forestry in April 2019. The case was based 

on accusations from the local village, related to the presence of several fish that died in the river and itchiness 

that arose after several residents bathed in the river. 

On 23 April 2019, SKL received the official complaint letter and offered a forum for an open dialogue with 

all of our related stakeholders. Subsequent to the open dialogue on 24 April 2019, representatives from the 

Department of Environment and Forestry conducted site visits around the Estate and Mill within the proximity 

of the alleged polluted river. The Department also interviewed village officials as well as residents.  With the 

help of Fisheries and Maritime Service they took 6 (six) samples from the river back to their laboratory. 

SKL continued an open discussion with the local villagers and monitor the water quality on the river daily 

during this time. In June 2020, once the result from the laboratory has been finalised, the Department of 

Environment and Forestry concluded there was no pollution originated from SKL operations. The report was 

presented to the village officials and local residents as well through an open discussion forum. 

SKL continued to help the local village to find the cause for the death of the fish in the river. And to support 

the local residents income, SKL helped them with fish seedlings to ensure they will have a sustainable 

business in the coming months.

Waste Management 

Good waste management shows the Group’s 

sustainable growth and production of palm oil. We 

are committed to reducing, reusing and recycling. 

The main waste products from milling processes 

include organic solid plantation waste such as 

empty fruit bunches (EFB), fibres, shells and palm 

oil mill effluent (POME), which are predominantly 

reused, recovered and recycled. 

EFB is applied as mulch to conserve moisture, 

improve soil fertility, and reduce weed growth. Shells 

and fibre also provide renewable boiler feedstock. 

Recycling production and plantation waste acting as 

organic fertilisers would reduce operational costs. 

As our procedure is to store the waste for a total of 5 

years. After that time has elapsed, the waste could be 

recycled into compost fertilizer that could be applied 

as an addition to our palm trees.

In 2019, we recovered 178,819 tonnes of empty 

fruit bunches, which is a significant decrease from 

204,913 tonnes in 2018, and 539,501 m3 of effluents 

from processing activities, which is also a decrease 

from the previous year of 619,283 m3. These are 

solely due to the drop in the FFB processed in 2019. 

[GRI 103-1, GRI 103-3] 

We have a holistic waste management system which 

aim is to harness waste as useful materials or minimise 

waste, so that the impact of our operations on the 

environment is mitigated. The Group can increase our 

overall yields while at the same time cutting costs by 

using less chemical supplements by efficiently utilizing 

land application methods to supplement our palm 

oil trees. We can reduce the costs needed to run our 

boilers and generators through the utilization of other 

biomass forms such as shells and fibre as a substitute 

for diesel. [GRI 103-2]

The Government has applied more stern regulations 

on the handling of hazardous materials. The Group has 

always been committed towards the regular monitoring 

of the use of waste, especially those categorized as 

hazardous materials, which consists of used lubricants, 

used rags, used batteries, used filters, empty paint cans 

and printer cartridges, and needles from health clinics. 

In our site office, the waste produced was less that 50 

kg for one day. Our procedure is to segregate, label 

and store in a secure, fire resistant temporary storage 

facilities. Our storage facilities are equipped with 

accidental spill containment kits, alarms, firefighting 

gears, shower/eyewash and first aid kits. The period 

of waste disposal relies on its type and category, with 

storage times ranging from 180-365 days. Furthermore, 

we have collaborated with community health centres 

or “puskesmas” for our medical waste which will 

incinerate the waste safely

Palm Oil Mill Effluent Management 

Oil palm plants are so productive, every part of it can 

be used such that nothing is wasted. Even the by-

products of palm oil production and processing can be 

turned into something useful which making oil palm 

one of nature’s zero waste crops.

The oil palm fruit produces 2 products namely crude 

palm oil (CPO) and crude palm kernel oil (CPKO). CPO 

is obtained from the mesocarp and CKPO from the 

kernel. During the extraction process, it generates 

waste such as empty fruit bunch (EFB) and palm oil 

mill effluent (POME). These wastes are applied to the 

fields in sustainable manners as organic fertilizer. 

By implementing POME as organic fertilizer, it helps 

reduce inorganic fertilizer usage.

As many as 539,501 m3 of waste water has been 

Hazardous waste are then collected by licensed third-

parties for proper disposal in accordance with national 

legislations and international best practices. The carrier 

would then issue a manifest of handling of hazardous 

waste transport which Kencana will use as proof to report 

to the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. Our Health 

and Safety Officers at each site has been properly trained 

and are qualified to monitor and ensure that the waste 

management practices are in accordance with the rules. 

Facilities are inspected regularly by the Regional 

Environmental Agency. We guarantee that our 

plantation have up to date facility permits.  In 2019, 

each mill produced an average 3.1 tonnes of hazardous 

waste, which was roughly the same amount produced 

in 2018. In 2019, there were no reports of any significant 

spills. [GRI 306-2, GRI [306-3] 

generated from our mills in 2019. The effluent quality is 

expressed using a median Biological Oxygen Demand 

(BOD) at 626 Mg/l. This number is below the regulated 

standard of BOD level at 5,000mg/l.

Our studies from 2014 to 2019 showed that addition of 

water and extra nutrients to the soil might boost yields 

of oil palm production from 6 tonnes/ ha to 8 tonnes/ha, 

compared with other blocks in the same planting year 

without land application of reutilised POME. Based on 

those studies, we put into use 100% of our production 

POME as fertilisers back into the field on areas that have 

already been licensed for land application.

It is important to note that the Group does not 

discharge any of our POME into waterbodies. The 

amount of palm oil mill effluent (POME) recycled back 

to the plantations was at a ratio of 0.63 m3 of effluent 

per 1 metric ton of FFB processed. [GRI 306-1]

We strive to maintain our Biological Oxygen Demand 

(“BOD”) level effluents to be applied for land 

application is safely below the standard.  The table 

below describes our BOD level across our mills of the 

wastewater treatment outlets, with the water later 

used for land application. [GRI 306-1]

Even though our BOD level is under the regulated 

limit, we continue to improve a robust liquid waste 

management system by ensuring minimum waste 

value. we continue to safeguard the quality of 

groundwater and prevent any risk of contamination by 

installing monitoring wells in surrounding areas. These 

wells are covered, locked and maintained regularly. As 

part of the PROPER assessment, representatives from 

the Regional Environmental Agency inspect the quality 

of the water within the wells regularly.

Integrated Pest Management 

Achieving maximum palm fruit yields with minimal 

pollution requires careful management of our inorganic 

fertiliser inputs. Combination of ecological, physical, 

biological, cultural and chemical methods are employed 

to control pests and diseases in our estates. This 

Integrated Pest Management philosophy seeks to prevent 

the excessive use of chemical pesticides which could have 

an impact on the environment and workers’ safety. 

The Group seeks to optimise the quantity of organic 

and inorganic fertiliser that it applies and supplements 

inorganic applications with organic fertiliser so as to 

maximise the use of the empty fruit bunches (EFB) 

discarded by the mills. The application of EFB for 

mulching provides the palms with organic matter that 

helps to retain ground moisture which is important 

during dry weather periods and also helps to minimise 

the application of inorganic fertiliser. [GRI 103-1]

Kencana 

conducted 

non-chemical 

pest 

control 

measures in our plantation to minimise the use of 

chemicals to sustainably maintain pest populations 

within economic thresholds with minimal harm to 

local ecosystems. In this system, encouraging natural 

predators have enabled a reduction in the utilisation of 

pesticide.  Since 2015, we managed to reduce our use 

of chemical pesticides. [GRI 103-2, GRI 103-3] 

Our integrated pest management strategy includes 

a combination of biological controls and good 

agricultural practices. Several pests found in the 

perimeter of Kencana Agri’s plantations and mills 

are including rats, rhinoceros beetles, bunch moths, 

bagworms, and nettle caterpillars.

The 

Group's 

long 

established 

Integrated 

Pest 

Management system aims to prevent pest outbreaks 

by boosting biological control. In order to optimise 

natural pest control, we breed owls to control rat 

populations.

Kencana has planted species of plants known to attract 

natural predators of the major leaf eating pests of oil 

palms, including bagworms and caterpillars to flourish 

by planting Turnera subulata, Turnera ulmifolia, 

Antigononleptopus, Cassia tora, and Nephrolepis. 

Moreover, to control metisanaplana, a pesky caterpillar 

native to West and Central Sulawesi region, the Group 

cultivates Turnera Subulata, Turneraulmifolia, Cassia 

tora, Euphorbia heterophylla, and Antigonon leptopus 

which are planted at each block alongside palm oil 

crops. These plants contain nectar and pollen that 

serve as a food source for parasitoid insects and 

predators of the pest caterpillars, ultimately bringing 

pest populations under control. 




Biological control clearly holds 

great promise for solutions to pest 

problems affecting our plantation. 

Allow us to introduce you to our

OUR BIOLOGICAL  

CONTROL 

OWL 

Owls are the best partners to oil palm 

growers due to their ability to adapt well in 

oil palm plantations, significantly reducing 

rat population and usage of rodenticides. 

We placed nest boxes around the perimeter 

of our plantations to invite barn owls 

to nest. By the end of 2019, PT Sawindo 

Kencana had been the home for a total 93 

adult owls (Tyto alba), 22 juveniles as well 

as 115 unhatched eggs. 

TURNERA ULMIFOLIA 

Turnera Subulata blooms every 8 AM in the morning. 

This flower is originally from Mexico and the West 

Indies. Aside from helping make the plantations look 

more colorful, the flower is also the perfect home 

for Sycanus. The flower becomes a food source and 

host plant for Sycanus, the predators of leaf-feeding 

worms, so that the pest attack can be suppressed,

TURNERA SUBULATA 

Beneficial plants such as Turnera subulata, are 

extensively planted throughout our estates 

as biological control for leaf-eating pests. The 

flower is the perfect home for Sycanus, a type of 

insect that hunts caterpillars and worms that can 

damage oil palms. This beautiful flower has been 

helping us to suppress and minimise pest attack. 

ANTIGONON LEPTOPUS 

Antigonon leptopus is regarded as an 

environmental weed in many parts of the world. 

It is flowering shrubs which host a range of 

predators of leaf-eating pests. This powerful 

beauty help Kencana in our pest control 

approaches.

Nature Conservation [GRI 304-1, GRI 304-3] 

Sustainability is defined as using resources to meet 

human needs while ensuring the conservation of 

natural systems and environments today and into 

the future. That is why sustainability resides at the 

core of our values and aspirations. The Group has 

been protecting the natural environment around 

the perimeter of its plantations and mills. We strives 

to conduct an operation in respect towards the 

surrounding environment, especially in regards with 

the protection of the biodiversity. 

Many tropical regions are facing the risk of losing their 

High Conservation Value (HCV) areas due to extensive 

conversion of primary forests into plantations. the 

Group conducts effective conservation efforts under a 

number of initiative in line with ISPO and ISCC standard. 

Our approach toward nature conservation includes 

continual improvement of our High Conservation 

Value (HCV) area monitoring efforts, internal capacity 

building, engagement with local communities and 

other oil palm plantation companies, as well as 

partnerships with academic and research institutions, 

NGOs and governmental organizations. [GRI 103-1] 

Kencana has committed to the conservation of 

environmentally valuable forest within our concession 

areas. We conducts HCV assessment for all new 

development areas through accredited independent 

HCV assessors. It is always our commitment to 

preserving all conservation areas, maintaining habitats 

and not converting HCV land into plantation.

By the end of 2019, we currently conserve and protect 

more than 42,600Ha of HCV forest inside our concession 

areas. We ensure to conduct HCV studies for all new 

development areas, through accredited independent 

HCV assessors, and implements a management 

strategy that focuses on these following key aspects:  

•	 Preservation of river border lines. 

•	 Cultivation local trees in HCV area 

•	 Educating the local community on the importance 

of preserving HCV areas. 

•	 Regularly monitoring river water quality. 

•	 HCV areas are regularly monitored and audited by 

the internal sustainability team. 

•	 Recording every wildlife species found in the 

estates, and taking notes of those classified as 

vulnerable and above on the list of protected 

species under Indonesian Government Regulation 

No. 7 of 1999 on Preservation of Flora and Fauna.   

A comprehensive and methodological HCV assessment 

has been conducted, and we have successfully 

identified 42 (forty two) flora and fauna distribution 

in Kencana Agri plantation areas. As many as 5 (five) 

species are categorized as endanger, another 5 (five) 

species are categorized as vulnerable, and 1 (one) 

species is categorized as new threated. While 31 (thirty 

one) species are categorized as least concern.

K

encana acknowledge that Fire Management, especially in Kutai Kartanegara has become 

an integral part of our daily operations. Despite our best efforts, in 2019 some fires have 

occurred within our concessions, especially during the dry weather season. In 2019 Kencana 

has identified that all of these fires originated from outside of our concessions, which are 

mostly set-off by the local communities that still practice burning either for land clearing, 

or to ease fishermen to look for fish in area covered by tall grass. Thus daily, a team of fire 

patrol conduct inspection along our perimeter, to ensure there is no fire within our concession. 

Each fire incident occurred close to the border, even if they are outside of our concession, are 

reported to the Police and relevant agencies. 

As we have managed in the previous years, Kencana continues to work together with the 

regional government to help the locals conduct their fishing practices in a more sustainable 

way, for example by educating them to make fish cages. However, to intensify our efforts, 

Kencana initiated a program to work together with six other oil alm companies, neighbouring 

with our estates in Kutai Kartanegara. This social development program is to be set across seven 

neighbouring villages: Desa Sabintulung, Desa Puan Cepak, Desa Sedulang, Desa Menamang Kiri, 

Desa Menamang Kanan, Desa Muarakaman Ulu, and Desa Liang Buaya. All companies agreed to:

•	 Each Company is to conduct social development programs within 

each of their integrated posts scattered among 7 villages.

Despite our best efforts, fires may occasionally occur in our concessions, particularly during the 

dry season. Most of these fires originate from enclaves within our concessions that are set aside 

and controlled by small scale farmers and local communities that continue to practice burning as 

a means to clear land. Some fires also originate outside our concession areas and spread to our 

concessions due to topography or wind.

Farmers Community Empowerment Program









In July 2019, Kencana Agri, through its subsidiary PT 

Sawit Kaltim Lestari launched a program to empower 

local females (Kelompok Wanita Tani Cempaka - KWT 

Cempaka) residing in Cipari Makmur village in East 

Kalimantan to improve their economic welfare by 

enabling them to cultivate their own farms producing 

cassava, ginger, curcuma and coffee. The KWT Cempaka 

consists of 15 (fifteen) women, all housewives, who 

wants to learn how to earn more income for their 

families. 

By utilizing approximately 1 (one) hectare of 

community owned land, these ladies learned how 

to grow their own produce through the support from 

the Plantation Agency of Kutai Kartanegara Regency 

in the form of seedlings and PT Sawit Kaltim Lestari in 

the form of palm pulp that are then used as fertilizers. 

In addition to offering support by giving the farmers 

free fertilizers, Kencana Agri  has also donated funds 

for the purchase of electric cassava cutting machines, 

spinner machines, MSME product packagings, banners 

and more. Products produced by the farmers are 

then largely partially purchased by Kencana Agri’s 

subsidiaries PT Sawit Kaltim Lestari, PT Agro Inti 

Kencanamas and PT Agri Eastborneo Kencana and 

distributed amongst the company’s employees in 

order to ensure steady income for the farmers. 

Through the support given by Kencana Agri to 

empower local female farmers, the community 

benefits as their income levels rise. Our involvement 

and CSR participation in the Cipari Makmur village 

surely helped the social economic welfare of the 

villagers to improve.

Palm oil operations are labour intensive, and 

new developments are often in rural areas that 

may otherwise offer few opportunities for local 

communities.  Building partnership with independent 

smallholders has become our main focus in 

managing our plantation in a sustainable manner 

and improving smallholders’ welfare. We believe by 

the implementation of partnership system  with the 

plasma smallholders will have a multiplier effect in 

the regions.

We will support smallholders by sharing sustainable 

best 

practices, 

providing 

technical 

assistance 

and including them in our Group's supply chain. 

Our plasma partnership program has successfully 

improved the quality of life of our farmers. Among 

other, our partnership program in PT Sawindo Kencana 

which located near a small village called Tempilang. 

The village has benefited positively with activities as 

monetary circulation has increased in the last two 

decades. The local community also host a cultural 

event called Ruahan every year.

According to government regulation, minimum 

requirement of plasma planted area is 20%. However, 

Kencana managed to have of smallholder account 

for more than 70% area in Bangka. Through our 

plasma partnership program, we provide practical 

training, quality seed stock, advice on fertiliser and 

pesticide procurement and usage, exposure to new

Kencana Agri’s plasma partnership programs consist of three main programs, namely:

•	 KKPA (Kredit Koperasi Primer untuk Anggota or 

Credit for Members of Primary Cooperative) 

 

Through KKPA program, we provide funding for 

the local community for plantation development. 

In this program, Kencana collaborates with 

banks and cooperatives, while the Group acts 

as Guarantor. Moreover, we provide training and 

mentoring sessions for local farmer cooperatives 

and its members about good agricultural practices, 

administration, cooperative management, basic 

financial management, and more.



•	 KKSR (Kebun Kelapa Sawit Rakyat or 

Community’s Oil Palm Plantation) 

 

Our KKSR program aims to empower local 

communities and support them to improve their 

welfare through the utilisation of uncultivated 

lands in the region which are owned by the 

government as palm oil plantation.  We collaborate 

with the local government by offering a purchase 

guarantee of the KKSR plantation output as our 

raw material.

•	 Revitbun (Revitalisasi Perkebunan

on providing health services free of charge to remote 

communities in Indonesia. It is a medical aid program 

initiated by dr. Lie Dharmawan that primarily operates 

a ship to provide free medical services throughout 

Indonesia. They seek to help unprivileged people 

who live in areas that are very remote and typically 

inaccessible by existing medical assistance.

The 4 (four) major programs that they offer, including 

major surgery (surgical procedure with full anaesthesia), 

minor 

surgery 

(surgical 

procedure 

with 

local 

anaesthesia), general consultation (including medical 

distribution but non-invasive) and health education. 

Through this program, the local communities who lives 

in the remote areas in Indonesia, can have an access 

to medical assistance without having to travel to the 

hospital.   

The Group sees that the humanitarian aid brought 

through DoctorSHARE is very honourable. We have 

cooperates with DoctorSHARE since 2014 to provide 

medical support for the community.   

In 2017, we invited dr. Lie to Kencana Agri to speak on 

his vision and mission in providing free medical services 

to the communities at remote villages throughout 





Indonesia. He emphasizes that the passion for serving 

the nation should never cease.

In 2019, DoctorSHARE and Kencana Agri collaborated 

together to celebrate the 10th anniversary of 

DoctorSHARE in Jakarta. The event was held in the 

floating hospital itself and was attended by many 

donors, government officials and guests from numerous 

private sectors. The aim of the event was to raise 

awareness on how some parts of Indonesia still have 

very limited access to good medical services. Thus, the 

event attracted donors to participate in building and 

strengthening DoctorSHARE hence that it will continue 

to help the underprivileged around Indonesia for years 

to come.

Kencana Agri’s Commitment  

Towards Better Performance 

At Kencana Agri, we share a set of core values for our 

people which underpin all the work we do. A program 

called BUSI (Budaya Eksekusi or Culture of Execution) 

was initiated in 2018 and continued to be implemented 

throughout 2019, from high management up to 

plantation workers to promote the synergy of our 

corporate culture. The objection of this program is 

to strengthen our culture where workers are able to 

execute their work plan. This initiative is a 'top- down' 

change management program that began in the top 

management level in Jakarta, then rolled out to middle 

management in both HO and SO, and finally to all 

workers at SO. 

With the spirit of better performance, we encourage 

our employee to know what are their goals and priority 

for the year. This goal should be derivatives of the 

Group’s most important goal. And how we execute this 

approach is every employee has to present to their 

target, their actual achievement, and their next target. 

This is implemented to everyone in Kencana, and 

carry out in a weekly basis. We expecting this exercise 

to stimulate every employees sense of urgency, how 

they will execute their programs accordingly, and more 

importantly to build better relationship within and 

between departments. 

To ensure the implementation of this program, the 

Group also holds BUSI training that aims to directly 

improve employee competency and indirectly on 

product quality. Moreover, in order to monitor the 

execution of this program, we carry out progress 

reviews of each department in achieving the goal.  

Important aspects in the implementation of BUSI, 

namely:

Remuneration [GRI 202-1]

A large majority of employees benefit from laws that 

guarantee a minimum wage, and, whenever this is not 

the case, the Group’s policy ensures that compensation 

is above the minimum wage (Upah Minimum Regional 

- UMR) observed locally. In 2019, our permanent 

employee receives an average of 2.81 times above 

the UMR across our area of operations. In the spirit 

of diversity, we give equal chances with equal wages 

strictly based on the UMR and personal competency 

and achievement.

Our trainings and development program covered various topic which is relevant for the Group business development. In 

2019,  as many as 14 (fourteen) trainings topic has been held for our employees, the topics and total participation of the 

trainings is described in the table below.

Besides our remuneration program, The Group provide 

facilities and programs for the families of our employees. 

We believe that providing a good quality of life for our 

employees would improve their ability to give their 

best. One of our priority is ensuring the best case and 

education for the children of employees. Moreover, we 

also provide transportation facilities for the children. 

As part of our commitment, a primary school was 

built to complete a project in PT Sawit Kaltim Lestari 

in which already began a few years back by running 

kindergarten classes for the workers’ children. The 

mission was commenced as a long term program not 

only to ensure the quality of education of which the 

workers’ children can receive, but also their safety as 

well. By building a school within the Estate’s vicinity 

the students no longer need to venture outside the 

Estates into the main road.

Although this school building program is a long-

term program, and will be implemented gradually 

throughout our Estates, to ensure the comfort of our 

employees, we facilitate each of our estate with a day 

care centre for the children of our workers. With this 

day care facility, we ensure that the children will be 

taken care until their parents finish working. Some day 

care also have developed character building program 

for the children and collaborate with local religious 

leaders and mosques to hold religious activities  and 

moral educations for the children.

PRIMARY SCHOOL PROJECT OF PT SAWIT KALTIM LESTARI

Started in 2018, Kencana Agri has initiated a project in building a primary school in 

Kutai Kartanegara, Kalimantan Timur. The school was built within the vicinity of PT 

Sawit Kaltim Lestari, which was a part of one stretch of estates in Kutai Area. The 

school was completed in 2019 and is currently in use for the workers children in 

support for 3 (three) estates and 2 (two) mills in our Kutai Area. 

The school is a filial school of the SDN 02 School in Muara Kaman. The school has 6 

classes from grade one to grade six. There are currently 9 teachers which includes 

one teacher for each grade, one Islamic education teacher, one Christian education 

teacher, and one physical education teacher.  As of December 2019, there were 109 

students attending the school and we are confident that there will be an increase in 

the number of students in the coming years. 

At the end of 2019 the school began to build a library and a new canteen facility 

which will be completed by early 2020.  The school is currently used mostly by the 

workers’ children, but the school is open for other children from the surrounding 

village, as the next nearest primary school can be a bit too far for some. In addition, 

we also provide transportation units to transfer the children to their school. The 

transportation unit is available in each estate of Kencana Agri. 

The school is currently used mostly by the workers’ children, but the school is 

open for other children from the surrounding village, as the nearest primary school 

could be located too far from the community residence. As of December 2019, there 

are 109 students attending the school and we are confident that there will be an 

increase in the number of students in the coming years.

WELFARE FOR EMPLOYEES’ FAMILIES 

Sustainability Practices Improvement  

in Collaboration with Golden Agri Resources &amp; Verite  

In the current global trading system, the traceability of products 

supplied to buyers is very important in the supply chain. Producers and 

buyers jointly have the responsibility of practicing responsible trade in 

a sustainability scheme. PT Sawit Kaltim Lestari as one of Kencana Agri 

Group subsidiaries which is also a supplier of CPO and Kernel products to 

GAR (Golden Agri Resources), has reached a new milestone by conducting 

a joint Sustainability Development Program study with Golden Agri 

Resources, Nestle, and Verité. The study was conducted to improve 

sustainability practices especially on the issue of workers welfare. 

The first visit was carried out in April 2019 in PT Sawit Kaltim Lestari, 

Kutai Kartanegara, East Kalimantan. The team consisted of 7 Verite team 

members from Indonesia, Vietnam and the Phillipines, and 1 team leader 

from GAR. The aim of the study is to:

a. Finding gaps in labour issues within our operations, and finding 

sustainable solution

b. Prepare action plans to improve workers condition

c. Provide training and recommendations to increase Kencana Agri’s HR 

management capacity

Within their visit in April, 39 people were interviewed; 15 people from 

mill and 24 people from estate. Out of the 39 people, 26 were male 

and 13 were female. Questions were asked around the topics of work 

safety, environment, and health related issues. Findings and their 

recommendations were compiled and presented to top Management. 

Kencana Agri together with GAR and Verité have conducted meetings 

following the visit in 2019, discussing a strategic model which would be 

implemented in the following years. We expect this partnership will not 

just strengthen our policies and facilities for the workers, but furthermore 

improve our HR management team.

Human Rights 

We respect the rights of its employees to form 

representative organisations and to join – or not to join 

– trade unions, provided this right is freely exercised. 

Through our relationships with the unions we wish to 

sustain the long term development of our company 

by maintaining a level of competitiveness adapted 

to our economic environment. This commitment is 

realized by involving Labors Unions in the process of 

formulating Collective Labor Agreement that aims 

to protect employees’ and employers’ rights and 

obligations. 

Our Collective Labors Agreement is a written legal 

contract which covers industrial relations, working 

hours, remuneration, out-of-post assignments and 

transfers, social security and welfare, occupational 

health and safety, and employment termination. 

According to the agreement, the rights of our 

employees have been socialized and are written within 

the Group’s regulations.

Each of our units has union representatives, elected 

by members, who meet with local management 

representatives regularly to discuss and resolve issues. 

In 2019, there were 187 labour unions  across our 

plantations in Indonesia.

In order to have a good synergy with our people, 

the Group has develop a grievance system for our 

employees. Through this system, Our employees can 

express their complains by filing a letter of Grievance. 

Once a letter is filed, the employees’ superior would 

get in touch with them at a private meeting to further 

discuss their complaint and provide solutions that is 

agreeable to both parties. [GRI 102-41] 

Diversity and Inclusion [103-1][103-2] [103-3][405-1]

We believe in and values diversity and promotes a 

workplace that is inclusive, fair and fosters respect 

for all employees. The diversity of its employees and 

management is crucial to the Group’s competitiveness, 

innovative capacity and attractiveness. Kencana 

works to develop its employees’ skills and careers 

while prohibiting any discrimination related to origin, 

gender, sexual orientation or identity, disability, 

age or affiliation with a political, labor or religious 

organization.

Our plantation sites are located in rural areas in 

Indonesia. It is our commitment to support the local 

community where we operate by recruiting local 

people. However, for our estates in Kalimatan, we have 

to hire non-local workers due to insufficient number of 

workers available in the surrounding areas. 

Our goal is to ensure that diversity commitment is 

embedded in our day to day working practices by 

recruiting female workers in our operation. However, 

the nature of agricultural work means that certain 

jobs continue to be more suited to male rather than 

female employees. In 2019, as many as 22.46% of 

our employees were women. While in the senior 

management level, 5 out of 28 Senior Managers and 

Head level were female. 

Moreover, the Group provides training sessions to 

ensure the candidates are fully equipped to take on 

greater responsibility. We also support the career 

development for our female employees in every 

positions. All of our female employee has the equal 

opportunity for trainings and career development.

children. We aim to prevent all forms of child labour, 

and we rigorously enforce these principles at all 

our plantations, mills and other places of work. The 

minimum age for employment in any capacity is 18 

years. Our recruitment officers check identification cards 

of the prospective employee’s. Moreover,  the Group 

ensures to prevent a practice where parents bring their 

children to the workplace through the daycare facilities 

that are available at our operational sites. 

Occupational Health and Safety 

The Group place health and safety at the heart of its 

ambition to be a responsible company. The measures 

and indicators used to manage the Group’s activities 

are based on this fundamental value, in accordance 

with the strictest standards, particularly relating 

to health. This commitment is enforced through a 

number of policies and procedures which also covered 

in a formal agreement with labor unions. The health 

and safety topics which are relevant to the Kencana’s 

operation are 100% covered in our formal agreement 

with the labor union. [GRI 403-4]

We emphasise the need for safe working environments, 

and regularly audit the safety of our work conditions, 

which must meet the Group’s corporate standards. The 

Group implements procedures and prepare facilities 

that can ensure safety. Moreover, we regularly conduct 

trainings such as first aid and emergency responses 

regularly across all estates and mills in making certain 

that all workers are fully aware of their safety roles 

and responsibilities or any risks associated with their 

activities. 

In 2019, Kencana had managed to record a Zero Fatality 

in our plantations and mills. While severity rate in our 

estates were 258.72.

We commit to monitor the implementation of OHS 

policies and procedures to protect our employees’ 

rights for healthy and safe working conditions. 

Furthermore, we also continue to improve the quality 

of our facilities across the regions and conduct 

socialization of the OHS materials. [GRI 103-3]

We currently had a total of 8 OHS certified officers. 

The officers are responsible to monitor all work 

accidents and report to the Sustainability Department 

for verification and evaluation. Our officers have 

participated in carious trainings both internal and 

external related to the OHS materials. The trainings 

include first aid training and basic occupational safety 

and health training. In 2019, a total of 563 officers 

received numerous Occupational Health and Safety 

training. 

In promoting health condition of our workers and 

their family, we have equipped our estates with health 

facilities in the form of clinic or a collaboration with 

a Puskesmas (community health centre) around 

the village areas. We have equipped the clinics with 

ambulances for emergency situations.

In our estates, we also build a health facility in form 

of a clinic which is led by a paramedic and is assisted 

by several nurses that are HIPERKES (Company 

Hygiene and Occupational Health) certified. in case 

some referrals and treatments cannot be treated at 

the clinics, we also have cooperate with the nearest 

Puskesmas. A doctor from the nearest Puskesmas 

conducts a regular visit to our on-site clinic.

Ensuring the health of our workers is also our priority. 

We have a medical check-up program for our workers 

which carried out at least once a year and are preferred 

for factory employees who work in areas with high 

noise, and even for employees who are often exposed 

to chemicals, such as spray employees. Depending on 

the area, a health check is carried out together with the 

local Puskesmas/ RSUD, or the local Province Health 

and Safety Center. Health checks generally examine 

audio-spirometry, lung, vision and cholinesterase. 

In addition, for our female workers who work with 

chemicals also receive pregnancy tests yearly, to 

ensure that no pregnant women are working while 

being exposed to chemicals. In 2019, as many as 852 

workers have received medical check-ups.
