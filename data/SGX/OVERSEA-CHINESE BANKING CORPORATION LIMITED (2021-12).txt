the sustainability strategy, initiatives and 

performance of our operations in key markets, 

namely Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and 

Greater China. This report covers the financial 

year ending 31 December 2021.

The disclosures in this report are provided at a 

consolidated level, covering all operations except

Great Eastern Holdings, a subsidiary of OCBC 

Group and a publicly listed company, publishes 

an independent Sustainability Report that 

provides detailed Environmental, Social and 

Governance (ESG) data concerning its operations. 

We recommend that this report should be read 

in conjunction with Great Eastern Holdings’ 

sustainability disclosures for a full overview of 

our performance.

Where applicable, data from previous financial 

years are included for comparison. This is OCBC’s 

first standalone Sustainability Report and should 

be read together with the OCBC Annual Report,

the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Responding to 

an extended and also a more severe Covid-19 

pandemic, we stepped up efforts to help our 

customers reduce social exposure and stay safe 

by enhancing our digital banking proposition. 

Customers’ expectations for an efficient, frictionless, 

and convenient digital experience have also risen. 

As digital banking will significantly change the 

conduct of banking and finance and to continuously 

improve our customer experience, we allocated 

more resources to our digital platforms to simplify 

and enhance the banking experience while instilling 

trust. Notably, OCBC Singapore is the first bank in 

Southeast Asia to enable face verification for ATM 

banking transactions without the need for ATM cards. 

In 2021, for every 10 new secured consumer loans, 

more than 6 were done digitally, and the volume 

of our digital secured loans were 3 times higher 

than a year ago. Almost all our new SME accounts 

are now opened digitally and after growing by 

about 40% from a year ago, our SME digital 

transaction volume was 6 times more than 

manual transactions. 

We are mindful of the dangers and the 

heightened risks posed by fraud and scam 

incidences and have put in place robust cyber 

defence and monitoring capabilities to strengthen 

our internal IT system security and enhance the 

security of digital banking for our customers. 

Advancing sustainability is central to OCBC’s strategy. Building on our past efforts, in 2021, we reinforced and integrated ESG considerations in our 

operations and businesses, partnered our customers to manage transition on climate change, promoted environmental sustainability, expanded our 

programmes to upskill and expand our talent pool, and helped our communities. The Board is confident that meeting the broader ESG goals in our markets 

will deliver sustainable and progressive long-term value with meaningful impact for our customers, employees, and the communities in the years to come.

Driving Sustainability

The Board stepped up its oversight of the Group’s 

overall sustainability agenda in 2021 by placing 

sustainability as central to OCBC’s strategy 

formulation. Our Sustainability Strategy focuses 

on five pillars - Putting Customers First, Building a 

Sustainable Future, Acting with Integrity, Valuing 

our People and Engaging Communities – which 

encompass the 15 material Environmental, Social 

and Governance (ESG) factors. The Board determines 

the relevance and significance of the 15 ESG factors 

to the Bank’s business operations and oversees 

the management and monitoring of these ESG 

factors. Additionally, these ESG factors contribute 

to meet six selected United Nations Sustainable 

Development Goals where we can make the 

greatest positive impact in our core markets.

The Board, through the Board Risk Management 

Committee, regularly reviews and approves the 

sustainability-related policies. Reinforcing the 

Board’s commitment, a sustainability training 

programme was conducted in 2021 for members 

to keep abreast of the changing global landscape 

and sustainability trends. 

Putting Customers First and Digital Transformation

The digitalisation of financial services and the 

innovations based on digital technology are rapidly 

evolving, accelerated by safety considerations and 

need to reduce social interaction brought on by 

While our banking systems and digital banking 

platforms are safe and secure, the Bank will be 

placing greater efforts through more active 

communication programmes with our customers. 

Additional safeguards, including lengthening 

of cooling-off period before implementation 

of requests for key account changes to minimise 

the risk of customers falling prey to scams 

were implemented.

Building Human Capital and Valuing Our People

The wellbeing and safety of our employees are 

paramount as Covid spread and turned more 

contagious in 2021. We stepped up our support 

to enable our employees to work effectively from 

home. Apart from enhanced safety measures, 

OCBC implemented several holistic wellness 

programmes to provide consistent and quality 

support, including the provision of Covid-19 

Vaccination Support Programme to all employees. 

To attract, retain, and develop our talent to ensure 

we are future-ready, we launched a suite of 

sustainability training modules for all 30,000 

employees across the Group as part of OCBC’s 

S$30 million commitment to talent development.

Advancing the Transition to a Low-carbon World

During the year, we strengthened our ‘Building 

a Sustainable Future’ agenda with a new Climate 

Strategy. A 5-year roadmap outlining our ambition 

to accelerate sustainable transition in our markets 

was rolled out. 

We are glad to report that we have achieved a 

significant milestone in our efforts to help customers 

transition to a low-carbon economy and exceeded 

our target of reaching a sustainable finance portfolio 

of S$25 billion by 2025 by achieving S$34 billion 

as of 2021. We also rolled out transition financing 

and expanded a wider range of offerings to provide 

credible solutions to our varied clients in all 

industries, including those in hard-to-abate 

sectors. As a result, our green loans to SMEs 

have doubled under the SME Sustainable 

Finance Framework.

Since becoming a supporter to Task Force on 

Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in 

2019, the Bank has enhanced our understanding 

and management of the Bank’s climate-related 

risks and opportunities, leading to the publishing 

of our first TCFD report in October 2021. 

As part of our Climate Strategy, OCBC is 

committed to achieve carbon neutrality for 

our banking operational emissions in 2022. 

This will be supported by a suite of environmental 

initiatives, including retrofitting our assets to 

improve energy efficiency, investing in low-carbon 

technologies and renewables, as well as developing 

a business travel policy to reduce business air 

travel. We are exploring investment in carbon 

credit-generating projects and pursuing responsible 

procurement of carbon offsets for our residual 

and unavoidable emissions.

To heighten global climate change awareness 

and challenges posed to businesses and society, 

OCBC launched a comprehensive climate survey 

to derive an Index score for Singaporeans. The 

purpose of the inaugural OCBC Climate Index is 

to serve as a starting point to raise awareness of 

carbon emissions and drive the adoption of 

environmentally sustainable practices among 

consumers and society at large.

Continuing Our Strong Engagements 

with Communities

Our sustainable goals include an active 

engagement and involvement of the development 

of the wider communities we serve. Building on 

the success from the first community shop a year 

ago, we supported a second community shop 

in 2021 to supply daily provisions to 1,000 needy 

families in Singapore and embarked on an ambitious 

3-year educational programme for children from 

low-income families. In total, we supported nearly 

200,000 individuals in 2021. We aim to support 

1 million vulnerable individuals in our core 

markets by 2023.

Fostering Stewardship and Governance

The Board is committed to ensuring OCBC’s 

core foundations of sound ethics and conduct 

and strong governance be continuously 

reinforced. In 2021, the first OCBC Culture and 

Conduct Dashboard was holistically developed 

to measure ethics and good conduct, by 

monitoring whether we are meeting desired 

outcomes for our stakeholders. The dashboard 

draws attention to key areas of culture and 

employee conduct so that a strong tone from 

the top is set for the entire organisation.

Creating a Sustainable World Together

While the uncertainties arising from the ongoing 

pandemic carry risks to our businesses and 

operations, we are ever conscious of the need to 

build greater resilience by being more responsive 

to rapidly evolving challenges and opportunities. 

Our strong fundamentals in capital, enlarged 

capabilities in our human talent, and our robust 

risk management process will enable us to grow 

new opportunities as we help customers attain 

sustainability in their business while transitioning 

to a low-carbon future. As we progress into 2022, 

we will continuously explore new opportunities to 

strengthen and grow our franchise, and explore 

new frontiers that will contribute to and create 

sustainable long-term value for all our stakeholders.

Championing sustainable transformation through 

innovative and responsible financing solutions, 

deepening collaboration across the Group businesses 

and entities, and enhancing our talent pool are 

imperative for the successful execution of our 

operational plan. Through forging a “One Group” 

integrated approach, we are dedicated to supporting 

our customers, employees, and the communities 

holistically across our core markets to create a 

sustainable world together.

We started a talent development programme 

called FRANKpreneurs to empower graduates to 

impact the banking world of today and the future. 

The 16-week summer internship allows graduates 

to work in cross-divisional groups across OCBC 

to generate future-oriented solutions to meet 

real world challenges. A new travel app launched 

by OCBC in 2021 was a result of this programme. 

At OCBC, we are committed to building an 

inclusive culture that embraces diversity, treats 

employees fairly and provides equal opportunities 

to all. We focus on maintaining a gender-equal 

workforce and strive to achieve 42% of leadership 

roles to be filled by women in 2022.

Our Approach  

to Sustainability

Stakeholder Engagement

We recognise the importance of understanding 

and being responsive to stakeholder expectations 

and interests. Stakeholder engagement is carried 

out on a regular basis and at every level of the 

business. Continuous, constructive and open 

dialogue is key to ensuring that we not only 

understand stakeholder expectations, but also 

that stakeholders gain a better understanding 

of our business. 

The outcomes of our interactions with 

stakeholders guide our approach to managing 

sustainability, including the identification of 

our material ESG factors and reporting on our 

sustainability performance.

 For more details on how we identify and respond to the 

needs of stakeholders, please see: www.ocbc.com/group/

sustainability/stakeholder-engagement 

Our Sustainability Governance Structure

A robust governance structure is the foundational building block for our sustainability strategy. The Board takes ultimate responsibility and drives 

all aspects of sustainability at OCBC.

OCBC regularly reviews our governance structure with regard to ESG and climate-related risks to achieve long-term sustainable growth.

Board

The Board provides oversight for the overall sustainability agenda and strategy at OCBC and is supported by the Sustainability Council. 

The Board determines the material Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors and considers sustainability issues as part of its strategy 

formulation. This includes providing oversight over the effective management of opportunities and risks associated with significant ESG issues 

such as climate change. The Board has ultimate responsibility for the Bank’s Sustainability Report. 

Sustainability Council

The Sustainability Council is chaired by the Group Chief Executive Officer and comprises members of senior management. Supported by the 

Sustainability Working Group and Climate Strategy Committee, the Council sets and drives the Group’s sustainability strategy, assessing ESG 

and/or climate-related risks and opportunities to ensure its alignment, relevance and effectiveness in supporting the Bank’s Corporate Strategy. 

It also ensures that the ESG factors are monitored on an ongoing basis and properly managed, and approves the Bank’s Sustainability Report. 

Sustainability Working Group

Climate Strategy Committee

The Sustainability Working Group (SWG) supports the 

development of the Bank’s Sustainability Report. As the 

Sustainability Champions of OCBC – driving, developing and 

supporting the implementation of sustainability initiatives 

within the Bank – the SWG also proposes Key Performance 

Indicators and targets for the ESG factors to be approved by the 

Sustainability Council annually.

The Climate Strategy Committee drives our 5-year Climate Strategy 

which encompasses five workstreams, namely, business, people, 

policies and systems, operations, and innovation and technology. 

They implement initiatives guided by three priorities of moving towards 

net zero emissions in alignment with the Paris Agreement goals, 

expanding sustainable financing and product portfolios, and growing 

a bank-wide ecosystem of sustainable solutions and partnerships.

Our Materiality Assessment 

Process

The sustainability context facing our business 

is changing faster than ever before. At OCBC, 

we take a long-term approach to assessing our 

materiality matters, considering ESG topics that 

can impact all stakeholders and our operations 

now and in the longer term. 

As part of our ongoing monitoring of ESG factors, 

we conduct an annual review to identify new ESG 

factors that have emerged as a result of recent 

global events and to validate the ongoing relevance 

of existing material ESG factors. As part of this 

review, we also seek to ensure that our selected 

United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 

(SDGs) continue to be relevant. In 2021, we 

worked with an external consultant to conduct 

our materiality assessment to ensure an objective 

review of our approach. The external consultant 

performed a gap analysis of OCBC’s material 

topics against global ESG best practices in the 

financial industry. Current sustainability trends 

and issues were also taken into consideration. 

Discussion sessions were held with OCBC’s 

senior management and relevant business units 

to review the results of the gap analysis. OCBC 

also consulted external stakeholders on their 

expectations of the Bank’s ESG efforts during 

periodic discussion sessions. The findings of the 

review were discussed and validated by the 

Sustainability Council before being presented 

to our Board for final approval.

How We Implemented the Results of the Review

Our current material topics and the SDGs remain relevant to our operations, aligned to industry best practices. However, we ramped up efforts and disclosures 

in responsible financing, sustainable financing, sustainability-themed products and investing, as well as our environmental footprint, to reflect our commitment to 

embrace the global climate agenda. This is further supported by the Group’s goal to achieve carbon neutrality for OCBC’s banking operational emissions in 2022.  

We believe our focus on climate action and sustainable transition is crucial at this juncture to preserve resources for the generations to come.

assessment report.

OCBC discussed with an external 

consultant to ensure an objective 

review of our approach. A gap analysis 

of OCBC’s material ESG topics against 

global best practices in the financial 

industry was performed. OCBC’s selected 

SDGs were also reviewed to ensure 

they are still relevant to the Group’s 

operations and initiatives.

OCBC’s senior management and 

Sustainability Working Group 

conducted regular discussions 

to keep abreast of global and 

local ESG topics that can impact 

stakeholders and operations 

at OCBC. We identified several 

ESG factors and trends that

As we progress on our sustainability 

journey and our business context 

changes, we will continue to evolve 

and update the relevance of our 

materiality through a regular review 

of our material ESG factors.

Sustainability Pillar 1: Putting Customers First

Digitalisation

Why this is Material to Us

The digitalisation of financial services is rapidly 

evolving, accelerated by the physical restrictions 

brought on by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. 

This comes at a time where customers’ expectations 

for a better, frictionless and convenient digital 

experience are increasing. As such, digitalisation 

is mission-critical for OCBC. We must continue 

to develop innovative and seamless digital solutions 

to meet customer expectations and improve 

digital banking services.

Our Management Approach

Digital transformation is an integral part of 

OCBC’s corporate strategy and cuts across every 

aspect of the Bank. Our digitalisation strategy is 

led by our Group CEO, who is supported by 

dedicated digital teams in Singapore as well as our 

other core markets. We remain committed to 

redefining digital banking by leveraging technology 

to make banking more inclusive and accessible to

technology, improving internal processes using 

data and developing data-led offerings.

New Initiatives and Ongoing Efforts

Democratising Wealth Management

OCBC has a suite of digital advisory solutions 

that provides data-driven insights for wealth 

management clients. In 2021, we continued 

to expand on our digital wealth management 

solutions by launching a comprehensive wealth 

trading platform. 

Our Digital Wealth Platform enables customers 

to make bite-sized and data-guided purchases 

across an extensive suite of asset classes such 

as Unit Trust, FX, Precious Metals, Equities and 

Insurance. Additionally, clients can select from a 

wide range of thematic or diversified portfolios 

through OCBC RoboInvest. We have also built an 

Integrated Wealth Dashboard to provide a snapshot 

of customers’ investment portfolios on the platform. 

Digital Wealth sales grew more than four times 

in 2021 compared to the previous year.

Expanding Cross Border Payments and Ecosystem

OCBC has launched a travel site called Travel 

with OCBC to help customers book airline tickets, 

hotels and car rentals using their OCBC reward 

points and OCBC Bank’s credit or debit cards. 

In line with this, we have also launched a 

travel-themed credit card, the OCBC 90°N VISA 

Credit Card, offering one of the highest air miles 

earn rates in selected daily spending categories 

among credit cards locally. This is all part of 

our strategy to build a larger digital ecosystem 

with value-added services beyond traditional 

banking products.

To further support our digital ecosystem for 

consumers, we have expanded our e-payments 

capabilities to include more fintech services 

in the markets we operate in such as PromptPay 

in Thailand. In addition, we have also expanded 

the services available on our platform, encouraging 

customers to use the apps more frequently. These 

include eGifting (Angbao), utilities payment (AXS), 

setting up automatic bill payments (EGiro) and 

expanding the coverage of recipients that our 

customers can pay to (FAST to non-FIs).

Improving the Everyday Digital Experience of 

Our Customers

We continued to roll out new digital initiatives 

across the region to serve different retail customer 

groups. Our new initiatives in 2021 included:

• Bank of Singapore launched an online trading 

platform for equities listed in seven major 

exchanges (i.e. NASDAQ, New York Stock 

Exchange, American Stock Exchange, Singapore 

Exchange, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing 

Market, Australian Securities Exchange and 

Tokyo Stock Exchange).

• Bank of Singapore launched digital onboarding 

services to help prospective customers open 

personal bank accounts virtually. The service 

eliminates the need for physical documentation. 

• OCBC Singapore is the first bank in Southeast 

Asia to enable face verification for ATM banking 

transactions without the need for ATM cards. 

Riding on Singapore’s National Digital Identity 

(NDI) infrastructure, Singpass Face Verification, 

OCBC customers can check account balances 

at selected ATMs. Additionally, Central 

Provident Fund (CPF) members can collect 

government pay-outs at OCBC ATMs via 

Singpass Face Verification.

• OCBC Singapore partnered with IRAS to enable 

instant tax payments using the Mobile Banking 

app to provide further convenience to customers.

• OCBC Singapore rolled out instant digital eco-care 

loans, a pre-approved car loan digital proposition 

and instant origination of multi-currency accounts 

as well as debit cards. A number of these offerings 

are approved within 60 seconds to 60 minutes.

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) 

are a critical part of our business. We help 

them achieve their aspirations by providing 

innovative financial and digital services that 

meet their needs. In 2021, we launched the 

following initiatives for SMEs:

• Made digital account opening for SMEs 

easier by enabling remote digital 

authentication via Singpass.

• Launched online self-help business account 

opening in Malaysia to reach SMEs across the 

country without requiring customers to visit 

a branch for physical document verification. 

This initiative will allow a wider range of SMEs 

to access our banking services.

• Expanded pre-approved digital loans to SMEs. 

This initiative aims to provide targeted relief 

measures such as temporary bridging loans 

Enhancing Digital Offerings for SMEs

and working capital financing to help SMEs 

maintain a healthy cash flow amid business 

disruption brought on by the ongoing pandemic.

• Established API connectivity with the 

Networked Trade Platform, achieving 

100% digital issuance of Regulatory Banker’s 

Guarantees (BGs) to Singapore Customs, with 

SMEs no longer requiring to lodge paper BGs, 

supporting their shift towards sustainable 

practices. Grew digital trade with SME 

customers in Singapore to 60%.

• Launched the Digital Business Debit Card, 

offering an instant payment capability upon 

issuance. This provides SMEs with greater 

flexibility and control over their cash flow. 

• Launched FX Online for SME customers, allowing 

them to book FX rates in real time via OCBC 

Velocity across all major currencies. OCBC is 

the first local bank to offer the FX Online 

capability to all corporates including SMEs.

• Enhanced OCBC OneCollect, a digital 

collections solution to help merchants 

collect and reconcile seamlessly through 

PayNow QR, Cross Border QRs and Chinese 

wallets, enabling merchants to pivot away 

from cash collections.

Sustainability Pillar 1: Putting Customers First

Customer Experience

Why this is Material to Us

We are committed to providing our customers 

with financial solutions that meet their needs and 

improve their lives. Deepening engagement and 

forging enduring relationships with our customers 

is also fundamental to our long-term success.

Our Management Approach

As we continue to digitalise banking, enhancing 

our customers' experience remains a key component 

in our approach. We embrace the practice of 

Human-Centred Design (HCD) that enables us to 

build a deep understanding of our customers' needs. 

As a result, we successfully develop products and 

services that are functional, easy to understand 

and emotionally engaging.

We also monitor and measure the quality of the 

delivered experience through customer satisfaction 

surveys on a day-to-day basis. We view feedback 

and complaints as opportunities for the Bank to 

learn and improve customer experience.

Our Complaint Management Council, comprising 

representatives across businesses and operations, 

ensures that all complaints received are reviewed 

and addressed adequately. Complaint data is also 

shared with senior management and the Board 

regularly to find areas for improvement.

Resolving Complaints Efficiently

We strive to ensure complaints are resolved 

efficiently and satisfactorily across our operations. 

When a complaint is received from a customer, 

the service staff will engage relevant internal 

business units to review it and work on a timely 

resolution. To ensure effective resolution, all 

retail banking departments have a service 

champion to support service staff dealing with 

customer complaints. For example, if a complaint 

is received on negative interactions with our 

mobile banking offering, the service staff 

handling the complaint will reach out to the 

mobile banking team to identify opportunities 

for improvement. 

OCBC scored the highest among financial 

institutions in Singapore in the 2021 Customer 

Satisfaction Index of Singapore (CSISG) Survey, 

validating our commitment to service excellence.

Upskilling to Improve Customer Experience

With the increasing shift towards digital banking, 

we continue to upskill our employees with 

technical capabilities to respond to the needs 

of our customers. This allows our staff to effectively 

recommend suitable digital services to meet 

our customers’ banking needs and enables 

them to share helpful tips with customers 

on how to safeguard their banking accounts.

Going Paperless 

We are making significant progress in our 

paperless and straight-through process initiatives 

at branches which help reduce the amount of 

time customers spend at the branches and also 

optimise customers’ experience. Through these 

initiatives, we have effectively eliminated laborious 

paperwork for our employees and in return free 

up time for employees to upskill their capabilities 

to provide more value-added services, such as 

financial planning for our customers. 

Achieved internal E-B score (1) of 79% for our 

Singapore Retail Banking, exceeding our target 

of 70% set for 2021

Our overall Net Promoter Score ranking among 

competitor banks in Singapore has remained stable at 

2nd place for 2021

100% of the 42 personal data-related complaints

Sustainability Pillar 1: Putting Customers First

Financial Inclusion

Why this is Material to Us

Providing innovative and accessible financial 

products and services is essential to meeting 

the needs of society, leaving no one behind. 

This is in line with the Bank’s strategy of 

helping individuals and businesses across 

communities to build financial resilience 

and achieve a sustainable future for all.

Our Management Approach

We take a holistic ‘cradle-to-grave’ approach 

in meeting our commitment to financial 

inclusion, ensuring the needs of retail and 

commercial customers throughout different 

stages of growth are met. We constantly 

develop new offerings and adapt our business 

to fulfil the diverse needs of society. For retail 

customers, OCBC has continued to offer tailored 

products for all age groups to help them meet 

their financial goals in different life stages 

including OCBC Life Goals, FRANK Study Loan 

and the OCBC Silver Years programme. For 

commercial clients, we are focused on ensuring 

businesses – from start-ups to larger enterprises 

across the region – have equal access to 

financing and other financial services to not 

only survive but also thrive and grow.

New Initiatives and Ongoing Efforts

Digital Loans to Micro-SMEs in Singapore

Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises 

(MSMEs) have been hit particularly hard by 

the economic disruptions brought on by the 

Covid-19 pandemic. As such, we have been 

providing targeted relief measures to help 

MSMEs strengthen their cash flows since 2020.

Through our digital lending capabilities, we 

expedited the financial assistance process 

for MSMEs by leveraging internal and external 

data that allowed us to pre-approve our offers 

in advance. By providing pre-approved loans, 

we also provide a sense of certainty for MSMEs 

and shorten the time to disbursement of funds. 

As a result of our efforts, we have been able 

to support our MSMEs clients who encounter 

financial hardship and loss of income. The amount 

of loans originated to MSMEs grew three times 

in 2021 compared to 2019. Going forward, the 

Bank will continue to provide relief measures 

to help MSMEs as the economy continues to 

recover from the pandemic.



Delivering on Our SDGs



Financial Solutions for Women Entrepreneurs 

The #TAYTB (1) Women Warriors was launched 

by OCBC NISP in 2020 to empower women-led 

businesses so they could reach their fullest 

potential. This is part of our commitment to 

contributing to the sustainable development 

agenda in empowering women to achieve 

gender equality and contribute meaningfully 

to Indonesia's socio-economic environment. 

We have rolled out a myriad of digital solutions 

to smoothen the financing and management 

of transactions for small businesses, including 

the provision of competitive interest rates 

for loans, the management of taxes and 

e-commerce transactions. Our women 

entrepreneurs have used the loans to help 

them increase business capacity, maintain 

healthy cash flow and purchase assets for 

business expansion. In addition, we have 

collaborated with external partners to support 

these entrepreneurs through various online 

learning forums and networking opportunities. 

In 2021, over 1,000 women entrepreneurs 

have benefited from this programme, with 

IDR 862 billion in new loans granted.

“The Bank understands our pain points and 

provides solutions, promoting the potential 

of women in business. Empowering women 

is one of the many ways to strengthen 

Indonesia's economy,” said an Indonesian 

woman entrepreneur who tapped on the 

services of OCBC NISP’s #TAYTB (1) Women 

Warriors initiative.

Sustainability Pillar 2: Building a 

Sustainable Future

Our Climate Strategy 

A Regional Leader in Sustainable 

and Responsible Banking

As part of our Sustainability Strategy, we have 

unveiled a 5-year Climate Strategy to support our 

actions in Pillar 2: Building a Sustainable Future.

Our Climate Strategy comes at a time where 

it is crucial for institutions, businesses and 

people to work in partnership to transition to 

a low-carbon economy to preserve a liveable 

planet for current and future generations. As a 

financial institution, we play a key pivotal role 

to help finance this transition. 

Our Climate Strategy’s priorities are:

Priority 1: Moving towards net zero emissions 

in alignment with Paris Agreement goals

Priority 2: Expanding sustainable financing 

and our sustainability-themed product portfolio

Priority 3: Growing a bank-wide ecosystem 

of sustainable solutions and partnerships

To deliver on our priority areas, we will 

implement initiatives and drive change across 

all our operations in partnership with our 

stakeholders. These include our supply chain, 

customers, government and communities 

in our core markets. For example, OCBC is 

an inaugural member of the Singapore Low 

Carbon Network (SLCN). Aligned with the 

Singapore Green Plan, the SLCN supports 

organisations and the community in their 

journey towards decarbonisation by building 

capability and sharing knowledge to achieve 

a low-carbon Singapore.

Vision: Regional leader in sustainable and responsible banking for a low-carbon economy by 2026

(1) The Poseidon Principles are a globally recognised framework that guides how a signatory bank determines, assesses and manages the climate alignment of its ship finance portfolio to support the shipping industry’s targets of reducing carbon emissions by at least 50% by 2050.

OCBC is committed to leading sustainable transition in the region. We are progressively aligning our financing and investing activities with the goals 

of Paris Agreement and partnering our customers to fortify their businesses against climate risks.

Seizing Growth Opportunities in 

Sustainable Finance

Our sustainable financing portfolio has grown 

from strength to strength. Having achieved our 

target of building a S$25 billion sustainable 

financing portfolio by 2025 ahead of schedule, 

we have now doubled our target to S$50 billion 

by 2025. Our financing will serve to accelerate 

the region’s climate transition in areas such as 

renewable energy and clean transportation. 

We are also well-placed to capture commercial 

opportunities in these emerging sectors created 

by the transition. 

Recognising that SMEs’ participation is crucial 

for sustainable development, we will continue 

to provide SMEs with access to climate financing 

solutions through our unique SME Sustainable 

Finance Framework, which has benefited more 

than 200 SMEs in the region.

Managing Climate Risks through 

Responsible Financing

In 2019, we were the first Southeast Asian bank 

to prohibit asset level project and corporate 

financing of new coal-fired power plants. We 

expanded our exclusion list to include thermal 

coal mines in the next year. Through these actions, 

our coal-related financing exposures and emission 

contributions are being phased out over time. 

We continue to strengthen our Responsible 

Financing policies which integrate ESG risk 

management, including climate risk, into our 

credit and risk evaluation process for our lending 

and capital market activities. As a signatory 

to the Equator Principles since 2020, we are 

committed to undertaking Climate Change 

Risk Analysis for applicable projects in high 

carbon intensity sectors.

Aligning our Management of Climate 

Risks and Opportunities with 

International Standards

Even as the global race to net zero gathers 

momentum, we must continue ensuring that 

our business strategies are resilient against 

climate risks and ready for new opportunities. 

To this end, we have been implementing the Task 

Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 

(TCFD) recommendations since pledging our 

support to them in 2019. Our inaugural TCFD 

report published in October 2021 outlines our 

progress in the areas of governance, strategy, 

risk management and metrics and targets with 

insights on short- and long-term climate risks and 

opportunities. Looking ahead, we will continue to 

ensure our actions and disclosures stand us in 

good stead for the net zero era, including 

measuring, reporting and reducing our financed 

emissions using best available methodologies. 

In 2021, we became the first bank in Southeast 

Asia to adopt the Poseidon Principles (1), joining 

leading global banks in a commitment to track, 

monitor and drive emissions reduction in our 

shipping portfolios. The Poseidon Principles 

provide a common global baseline for financial 

institutions to quantitatively measure and 

disclose the carbon footprint of their shipping 

portfolio against the ambition of the 

International Maritime Organisation (IMO).

Project Race-to-Zero: Achieving  

Carbon Neutrality for OCBC’s Banking 

Operational Emissions in 2022

As part of our Climate Strategy, we have a 

new plan to achieve carbon neutrality for OCBC’s 

banking operational emissions in 2022.

Our decarbonisation plan focuses on reducing 

Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions across all key 

operations in our core markets, as well as 

Scope 3 carbon emissions that are material to 

our operations. In 2021, we started disclosing 

business air travel under our Scope 3 carbon 

emissions. We will continue to monitor our 

emission sources and may expand our Scope 3 

emission sources in due course.

To meet our goal, we will implement a suite of 

environmental initiatives, including retrofitting 

our assets to improve energy efficiency, 

investing in low-carbon technologies and 

renewables, as well as developing a business 

travel policy to reduce business air travel. 

We are exploring investment in carbon 

credit-generating projects and pursuing 

responsible procurement of carbon credits for 

our residual and unavoidable emissions. 

Our targets and initiatives will be closely 

monitored and reviewed by the Sustainability 

Council on an annual basis. We will report our 

strategies and initiatives as well as our progress 

towards achieving carbon neutrality for OCBC’s 

banking operational emissions in 2022 in 

our annual Sustainability Report.

Increasing Renewables in Our Energy Mix

We intend to increase renewables in our 

energy mix to power our energy needs. 

We will begin installing solar panels in 

Singapore, and progressively roll out the 

installation in other key markets.

Reducing Energy Consumption 

and Improving Energy Efficiency 

We have set in place plans to increase building energy 

efficiency in all our properties such as replacing 

conventional lightings with LEDs and changing to 

more energy-efficient air-conditioning systems for all 

our managed buildings and Data Centre. This will 

contribute to the OCBC’s Sustainability plan in 

reducing carbon footprint. We will also relook at our 

existing spaces to consider how we can further share 

resources and reduce consumption. Additionally, 

we will review and tap on emerging smart building 

solutions to further cut energy use.

Converting All Corporate Cars  

in Singapore to Electric Vehicles

OCBC plans to replace all corporate cars in Singapore with 

electric vehicles when they are due for replacement. This 

approach ensures that we minimise wastage by maximising 

the use of our existing vehicles. 

We will also progressively replace our 

corporate fleet in other key markets.

Reducing Business Air Travel

Learning from our virtual work experience during the pandemic, we are able to carry out many 

of our cross-border interactions successfully without air travel. We will reduce our emissions 

by developing a group business travel policy for more effective business air travel, providing 

alternative travel modes for employees and streamlining our commercial activities to reduce 

business air travel.

Working with Partners to Invest  

in Carbon Credit-Generating Projects

OCBC is currently exploring investment in carbon credit-generating 

projects to offset emissions, such as nature-based solutions. 

As carbon credit is still an evolving field, we will approach this 

strategy with reputable partners with strong track records. 

We may also consider sourcing  

for carbon credit and Renewable  

Energy Certificates (RECs), where  

applicable, to offset residual  

and unavoidable emissions.

Building Electric Vehicles 

Charging Facilities 

We will install electric vehicle charging 

facilities for other Group-owned major 

commercial buildings. More electric 

charging facilities will complement 

the Bank’s initiative in converting all 

corporate cars to electric vehicles.

Our Target

Sustainability Pillar 2: Building a Sustainable Future

Responsible Financing

Why this is Material to Us

The growing threat of climate change and 

the urgent need for sustainable development 

pose both business risks and opportunities for 

the banking industry. It is imperative that we 

manage the evolving Environmental, Social 

and Governance (ESG) risks arising from and 

impacting our financing activities. We also have 

an opportunity to develop new solutions that 

can finance the transition to a low-carbon 

economy and a more sustainable future. 

Our Management Approach

Managing risks and ensuring that we are lending 

responsibly have always been key tenets of our 

approach at OCBC. We recognise that our financing 

activities may have an impact on the environment 

and society, and we aim to always manage the 

risks involved. Climate change will also have an 

impact on our clients and give rise to new physical 

and transition risks for the Bank. 

We are committed to supporting our clients 

in their transition to a low-carbon economy in 

line with the Paris Agreement. We recognise that 

doing so is not only socially responsible but is the 

best way to help the Bank mitigate climate-related 

risks and safeguarding the long-term success of 

our customers.

New Initiatives and Ongoing Efforts

Responsible Financing Framework 

Our Responsible Financing Framework defines our 

approach and commitment in managing ESG risks 

for lending activities. The Framework applies to 

key entities of OCBC Bank, comprising overseas 

branches, offices and wholly and majority-owned 

subsidiaries. The Framework sets the Bank’s

ESG-related approach to lending, debt issuance and 

debt underwriting activities for new and existing 

corporate, commercial and institutional clients. 

We will not engage in any financing activity where 

there is clear evidence of unmitigable adverse 

impact to the environment, people or communities 

or a violation of local regulations. 

We have begun aligning our Responsible Financing 

Framework with the Monetary Authority of 

Singapore’s Environmental Risk Management 

(EnRM) Guidelines for banks, which includes 

integrating climate risk considerations into our ESG 

Risk Assessment and credit underwriting process. 

This process is expected to be completed by 2022.

Enhancing our ESG Risk Assessment Process

We have also enhanced our ESG Risk Assessment 

Process for financing activities in 2021:

• The Bank’s ESG Risk Assessment Process 

governs all credit propositions and annual 

credit reviews conducted by relationship 

managers on applicable loans. Transactions 

that carry high ESG risks are subjected to 

enhanced evaluation and approval requirements. 

For instance, transactions with significant 

reputational risk will be escalated to the 

Reputational Risk Review Group (RRRG) (1) 

for additional review. In 2021, one transaction 

was escalated to the RRRG due to concerns 

regarding the client’s occupational, health 

and safety records; it was approved with 

conditions to ensure that the appropriate 

governance and procedures to manage health 

and safety issues were in place.

• As a signatory to the Equator Principles, we 

have integrated requirements from the Equator 

Principles into our ESG Risk Assessment Process 

for transactions within the scope of the Equator 

Principles. In 2021, an Equator Principles 

Implementation Procedure was established 

to provide relationship managers with detailed 

guidance on conducting ESG risk assessment 

for applicable transactions.

Exclusion List

• Our exclusion list and a summary of our 

sector-specific policies are available on our 

website. We will continue to monitor and keep 

abreast of the latest global sustainability and 

climate developments and adjust our exclusion 

criteria accordingly.

(1) The Reputation Risk Review Group was set up to review and make decisions on transactions with potential significant reputational risk to the Bank 

arising from Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues.

Sustainability Pillar 2: Building a Sustainable Future

Responsible Financing

Climate-risk Capacity Building Exercise

We conduct annual ESG Risks training for our 

relationship managers and credit risk managers 

on our Responsible Financing Framework 

and policies. In 2021, this also included topics 

such as MAS’ EnRM Guidelines and climate risk 

management and our TCFD pilot report. More 

than 790 relationship and credit risk managers 

attended our annual ESG Risks training. 

An external consultant was engaged to conduct 

sustainability training for our board of directors.

Topics covered include an overview of the current 

ESG landscape, impact of climate risks on financing 

activities and regulatory developments such as 

the MAS’ EnRM Guidelines. 

Responsible Investing Policy

OCBC has an organisation-wide Responsible 

Investing Policy, which integrates ESG considerations 

into the Bank’s investment activities. The policy 

is reviewed regularly and approved by our Board 

Risk Management Committee (BRMC).







We frequently engage with our stakeholders 

to build industry capacity in responsible and 

sustainable financing as well as climate risk 

management in financial institutions. The 

stakeholders engaged include industry 

associations, regulators, non-governmental 

organisations, employees and customers. For 

example, OCBC is part of the Association of 

Banks in Singapore (ABS)-led working group to 

develop a standardised climate risk 

questionnaire to assess climate-related risks of 

clients.

OCBC is a member of the MAS-convened Green 

Finance Industry Taskforce (GFIT) which focuses 

on addressing environmental and climate-related 

risks for financial institutions. We provide 

support in various workstreams under MAS 

GFIT such as enhancing the environmental risk 

management practices of financial institutions, 

improving disclosures, driving green finance 

Partnerships and Engagements 

solutions, capacity building and training. For 

instance, OCBC provided insights during 

the development of GFIT’s Capacity Building 

Series of e-courses on Fundamentals of 

Responsible Banking and Agriculture, 

Forestry and Fisheries. 

These e-courses were launched in 2021 by 

the Asia Sustainable Finance Initiative (ASFI), 

in collaboration with WWF Singapore and ABS, 

to enhance the capabilities of finance 

professionals in relation to environmental 

and social risks faced by companies. Our 

subsidiary, Bank of Singapore, is the first bank in 

Asia to roll out the new suite of e-learning 

courses from ASFI Academy to their 2,200-plus 

staff. We will continue to provide our support 

and engage regulators, industry, and customers 

in managing climate and ESG risks in line with 

our climate change statement.

Climate Risk Assessment of Financing Portfolio

Our first Task Force on Climate-related Financial 

Disclosures (TCFD) report was published in October 

2021, providing insights into our approach to 

governance, strategy and risk management, as well 

as key metrics and targets linked to climate-related 

risks and opportunities. The report also shows 

the results of our first assessment of how our 

corporate lending portfolios could be impacted 

by transition and physical risks under various 

future climate scenarios. This initial exercise

helped us explore the financial impacts our 

clients could face due to climate change and 

laid the groundwork for further efforts to support 

our clients’ climate transition.

Building on this study, we will continue increasing the 

breadth and depth of our climate risk assessments 

along with the advancements in data, tools and 

methodologies, through which we hope to navigate 

the climate transition alongside our clients with 

greater foresight, agility and resilience.

The Equator Principles are an 

environmental and social risk 

management framework to ensure 

that project-related financing is 

developed in a socially responsible 

manner, reflecting sound 

environmental management 

practice. In 2021, one Project 

Finance transaction was under 

the scope of Equator Principles. 

The Project was assessed and 

categorised in line with Equator 

Principles requirements. Please see

Sustainability Pillar 2: Building a Sustainable Future

Sustainable Financing

Why this is Material to Us

Financial institutions have a critical role to 

play in supporting sustainable development, 

in particular to accelerate the global transition 

to a low-carbon economy. As a market leader, 

we have the chance to catalyse sustainable 

solutions by directing capital flows to projects 

with meaningful social and environmental 

impacts or incentivising others to improve 

their sustainability performance.

Our Management Approach

We aim to be an Asian leader in sustainable 

finance by promoting banking products and 

services that embed sustainability in all our 

clients’ businesses within our wide international 

network. Our dedicated Sustainable Finance 

Group leads the Bank’s efforts to partner with 

like-minded customers, ensuring that the 

Bank offers bespoke and credible sustainable 

financing solutions that are aligned with 

international market standards and best 

practices. With sustainability becoming a 

strategic priority for many clients in all sectors, 

we seek to partner with our customers and 

all stakeholders in driving this agenda forward 

to continue to offer them meaningful and 

innovative sustainable finance solutions. 

This is how we want to contribute to 

Singapore’s ambition to become a regional 

sustainable finance hub.









Delivering on Our SDGs

Offering credible sustainable financing and 

engaging clients meaningfully require constant 

development of our teams. As an Asian bank, 

OCBC has a sizable business with corporates 

in agriculture sector. Deepening our knowledge 

in ESG issues in the agricultural sector is critical 

for impactful client engagement. The Bank 

partnered with ZSL (Zoological Society of London) 

– a renowned international conservation charity. 

ZSL is the organisation behind SPOTT 

Building Capacity on Sustainability Issues

(Sustainability Policy Transparency Toolkit) 

(spott.org) and an active member of FSC  

(Forest Stewardship Council) and RSPO 

(Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil). ZSL 

partnered with OCBC in offering a series of  

deep dive sessions on sustainability issues 

in the palm oil, forestry and rubber sectors 

for corporate customer-facing employees in 

Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore between 

May and November 2021.

New Initiatives and Ongoing Efforts

Green Loans for Singapore’s Small to Mid-Sized 

Developers and Building Owners

In 2021, we collaborated with the Building and 

Construction Authority of Singapore (BCA) to 

provide easy access to green loans for building 

owners, developers and small and medium-sized 

enterprises (SMEs). We leveraged BCA’s newly 

launched Building Energy Efficiency Assessment 

(BEEA) tool to avail a market-first S$148 million 

green loan facility for Tong Eng Group, one of 

Singapore’s leading private developers. The BEEA 

tool enables SME building owners and tenants to 

predict the energy performance of their buildings 

and projects assessed to be able to achieve a level of 

energy efficiency comparable to the certification 

standard of a BCA Green Mark 2021 GoldPlus Building 

will be eligible to obtain a green loan from us. 

This makes it simpler and more cost-effective for 

developers and SMEs to obtain green financing 

and to accelerate the shift towards green buildings 

and construction.

Easier Access to Sustainable Finance for SMEs

We launched the OCBC SME Sustainable Finance 

Framework in November 2020, the first of its kind 

in Singapore, designed to make it simpler and  

less costly for SMEs to gain access to sustainable 

financing. SMEs engaging in sustainable activities 

such as energy efficiency, renewable energy and 

clean transportation, in nine green project categories 

under the Green Loan Principles developed by the 

Loan Market Association, would be eligible for 

loans of up to S$20 million. We have offered green 

loans to over 200 SMEs through this process and 

the framework has also been implemented in 

Malaysia, Indonesia and Hong Kong SAR.

Financing Sustainable Transition

Sustainability Pillar 2: Building a Sustainable Future

Sustainable Financing

We are aware of the importance of developing 

a clear transition roadmap for corporates 

in hard-to-abate sectors. For instance, clients 

in the energy, transportation and agricultural 

industries are acting to future-proof their 

business and gain leadership in sustainable 

development. As such, OCBC aims to guide and 

support their ambition by offering credible and 

practical financing solutions to these clients.

In 2021, we expanded our offerings to include 

transition financing. Transition Financing is an 

emerging Sustainable Finance product to help 

businesses shift to a low-carbon economy. 

Transition loans require the companies to 

develop a transparent and time-bound transition 

roadmap; the financing must be used for 

activities related to shifting to low-carbon 

practices or technologies. Here are select 

examples of noteworthy sustainable finance 

transactions that OCBC advised in 2021:

Transition Loan with BW LPG 

BW LPG is on a journey towards achieving net 

zero carbon emissions. BW LPG has committed 

that by 2030, it will not have any newbuilding 

that cannot achieve net zero carbon emissions 

during its lifetime. BW LPG is retrofitting existing 

vessels with LPG dual-fuel propulsion engines 

that can potentially reduce carbon emissions by 

20%. To finance 6 of 15 vessels, BW LPG secured 

a US$45 million Transition Loan in August 2021 

which was the first ‘transition loan’ secured by 

the global shipping company in Singapore. 





OCBC acted as the sole green advisor for the deal 

and helped develop BW LPG’s Transition Finance 

Framework. V.E, part of Moody’s ESG Solutions, 

was engaged to provide a Second Party Opinion 

on the Framework.

of 10 banks. The global oil tanker owner and operator 

aims to accelerate its decarbonisation trajectory; 

the loan will have an annual sustainability margin 

adjustment based on Hafnia’s continuous 

improvement in emissions-related targets. 

OCBC acted as a joint sustainability coordinator, 

and Sustainalytics, a global leader in ESG data 

and research confirmed that the sustainability-

linked loan structure supports Hafnia’s 

sustainability strategy.

Sustainability-linked Loan with OUE C-REIT 

(Singapore)

OUE Commercial Real Estate Investment Trust 

(OUE C-REIT) has committed to improving its 

energy and water efficiencies in relation to 

their commercial portfolio in Singapore and 

Shanghai. To support its ambition, OCBC, together 

with other banks, offered a S$540 million 

sustainability-linked loan. OCBC acted as the 

sole sustainability advisor for the transaction. 

EY was engaged to provide an independent 

third-party opinion on the transaction.

Sustainability-linked Loan with Hang Lung 

Properties Limited (Hong Kong) 

OCBC provided a sustainability-linked loan 

of HK$1 billion to Hang Lung Properties Limited,  

which is their second sustainable finance transaction 

with the Bank. If Hang Lung Properties achieves 

a set of pre-determined targets covering a range  

of environmental, social and governance (ESG) 

metrics, its interest rate will be reduced on a 

tiered basis. These metrics include Hang Lung 

Properties’ performance as measured by external 

ESG benchmarking standards, one of which is 

its continued inclusion in the Dow Jones 

Sustainability Asia/Pacific Index. Hang Lung 

Properties has also obtained a green loan 

from OCBC in 2019.

Sustainability-linked Loan with Fortune REIT 

OCBC provided Fortune REIT with a 5-year 

sustainability-linked loan worth HK$1.5 billion. 

The facility is part of the Hong Kong-based retail 

REIT’s ongoing plan to integrate sustainability 

into its operations. The interest margins will be 

tied to a set of ESG targets including the reduction 

in electricity consumption, greenhouse gas 

emissions and waste generated by its properties.

Sustainability-linked Loan with Hafnia Limited 

Hafnia Limited has secured a 7-year US$374 million 

sustainability-linked loan in 2021 from a syndicate 









Delivering on Our SDGs

Spring City 66, Kunming is Hang Lung’s first property 100% powered by renewable energy. It is also the first commercial complex in Yunnan Province 

to achieve net zero carbon emissions in terms of annual electricity consumption.

BW LPG has the world’s largest fleet of LPG-powered VLGCs serving 

customers with the sector’s lowest GHG emissions profile. A total of 15 

VLGCs and over US$130 million have been committed to its keystone 

project to decarbonise operations.

Why this is Material to Us

Sustainable investing and sustainability-linked 

products have been gaining momentum globally 

in recent years amid greater demand from 

institutional and individual investors. This is 

driven by evidence that companies with strong 

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 

practices are more resilient and profitable over 

the long term. As a regional leader in responsible 

banking, we seek to meet this demand for 

sustainable investment products.

Our Management Approach

We recognise that there is no one-size-fits-all 

approach to sustainable investing for all customers. 

The ability to offer the right advice and solutions

centres on our deep understanding of our 

clients’ individual goals and preferences. 

As a trusted partner and advisor, we are 

able to provide unique and diverse products 

and services that help our customers achieve 

not only their financial goals, but also their 

aspirations to contribute to a more 

sustainable world. 

Our ESG product offerings cater to two 

different wealth management client segments, 

namely high-net-worth clients managed by 

Bank of Singapore (BOS), a wholly-owned 

subsidiary of OCBC Bank, and retail clients 

managed by OCBC’s Consumer Financial 

Services (CFS) division.

New Initiatives and Ongoing Efforts

Bank of Singapore’s Approach to Developing 

Sustainability-themed Products and Investing

Sustainable investing aims to achieve a positive 

and lasting impact for business and society. 

To this end, BOS adopts a “REAP” philosophy 

in our approach to ESG. 

Incorporating ESG considerations into BOS’ 

investment methodology provides for better 

decision-making as it allows the Bank to identify 

additional sources of risk and return based on 

key non-financial factors. These factors would 

have been excluded in a purely financial analysis. 

BOS focuses its analysis and decisions on the most 

material ESG issues, using third-party ESG data 

and research as starting points. Where material, 

such insights are taken into account as part of the 

investment decision.

Sustainability-themed Products  

and Investing









BOS also analyses broader sustainability themes 

and trends, including potential climate-related 

impact. This enhances its overall ability to 

understand and incorporate key environmental 

risk metrics into BOS’ research and investment 

analysis. To establish clear governance, BOS set up 

a Sustainable Investment Committee in 2021. This 

internal committee approves and evaluates BOS’ 

sustainable investment frameworks and policies. 

To grow the number of sustainability-themed 

products and investment offerings for clients, 

more than 75% of CFS and BOS’ recommended 

funds have a minimum of a ‘BB’ MSCI ESG Rating 

in 2021. Many of these recommended funds 

have incorporated ESG criteria in their investment 

process. Some of these funds also invest based on 

specific ESG themes such as ‘Clean Water &amp; Land’ 

and ‘Next Generation Energy’; these can tap on 

mid- to long-term sustainable opportunities such 

as global infrastructure development to support 

post-pandemic recovery, green energy transition, 

the accelerated adoption of electric vehicles 

and low-cost healthcare innovation. 

In August 2021, we launched the Electric Vehicle 

portfolio as part of our RoboInvest platform. 

This platform is for all segments of CFS individual 

customers with OCBC Digital access. 

The Electric Vehicle portfolio comprises stocks 

listed in the United States that are involved in 

the end-to-end value chain and production of 

electric vehicles. A proprietary methodology has 

been applied to ensure that only high-quality

The Electric Vehicle Portfolio

equities are included in the portfolio. Stocks in the 

portfolio have been screened for various factors 

including Earnings per Share (EPS), Return on 

Invested Capital (ROIC) and growth. In addition, 

proprietary algorithms on the RoboInvest platform 

monitor and rebalance portfolios on a quarterly 

or semi-annually basis. This theme resonated 

well with our clients and the EV portfolio was 

the second most popular among new investors, 

contributing &gt;20% of new investments from 

September to December.



To generate awareness of climate change and 

sustainability-related issues, Bank of Singapore 

organised four events in 2021, covering topics 

such as business sustainability practices, 

carbon footprint, climate action and 

sustainable investing:

• Beyond 2021 – The Great Reset Breakout 

session: Greening the Recovery

• ESG – Future of Mobility

• Singapore Redefined: The Green Agenda 

Webinar

• BOS Sustainability Summit

Most notably, BOS launched its first 

Sustainability Summit – The Climate 

Connection in 2021, bringing together 

thought leaders from private and public 

sectors to provide perspectives on key

climate change issues and risks; it delved into 

the role investors play in helping to achieve 

sustainability goals in Asia.



OCBC Group CEO Helen Wong and Chairman of the Singapore Economic 

Development Board Dr Beh Swan Gin at the Singapore Redefined 

conference; they participated in a dialogue on the challenges and 

opportunities for Singapore in a post-pandemic economy.

BOS is also the first in Asia to incorporate 

ESG factors in the assessment of the loan 

quantum for investment financing. With 

the inclusion of these, the quantum will be 

raised when the loan is secured by holdings 

in mutual funds with the best-of-class 

MSCI ESG Fund Rating of ‘AAA’ or ‘AA’.

Sustainability Training Programme 

CFS will intensify our efforts in educating 

and empowering staff. CFS has curated

a bespoke ESG training programme in partnership 

with Amundi Asset Management. 

The online training course was rolled out to all 

sales staff and wealth management product 

managers in Singapore and Malaysia in November 

2021 with the objective of building awareness and 

knowledge in sustainability and how that translates 

into responsible investing, ESG criteria for product 

selection and ultimately client-facing advisory. 

We have achieved 100% completion for Singapore 

and Malaysia staff.

our impact on the environment and do our part 

to protect the vital ecosystem that supports life 

on our planet. By not taking substantial actions 

now, we risk the long-term viability of our 

business and the wellbeing of our stakeholders. 

Our Management Approach

We are committed to reduce the environmental 

footprint of our physical operations. We unveiled 

our target to achieve carbon neutrality for OCBC’s 

banking operational emissions in 2022. This will 

be supported by a suite of environmental 

initiatives to increase energy efficiency and reduce 

consumption. 

New Initiatives and Ongoing Efforts

Tracking and Reducing Carbon Emissions

In addition to Scope 2 carbon emissions, OCBC 

began tracking and reporting Scope 1 and 3 

carbon emissions, including disclosing business air 

travel under our Scope 3 carbon emissions. 

Our carbon inventory serves to provide a 

baseline for the Group to assess environmental 

efforts needed to reduce carbon emissions in 

the long term. In line with our climate strategy, 

OCBC has launched the Project Race-to-Zero to 

drive strategies and initiatives to achieve carbon 

neutrality for OCBC’s banking operational 

emissions in 2022.

To continue providing relevant data to stakeholders, 

we will continue to improve the comprehensiveness

and completeness of our carbon emissions 

disclosures. This may include expanding 

Scope 3 carbon emissions disclosures aligned 

to industry best practices.

Building System and Energy Efficiency 

Green building ratings and certifications 

demonstrate the operating efficiency of 

our properties and premises. The Singapore 

Building and Construction Authority (BCA) 

Green Mark scheme is used to benchmark 

and improve energy efficiency for our 

operations in Singapore. 

We have achieved: 

• Green Mark Platinum Award for our 

Data Centre.

• Green Mark Gold Award for OCBC Centre, 

OCBC Centre East, OCBC Centre South, 

OCBC Tampines Centre One and OCBC 

Tampines Centre Two.

• Green Mark Certification for Bank of 

Singapore Centre.

• Green Mark GoldPlus Award for OCBC 

Holland Village Branch and NUS Frank Store.

• Green Mark Gold Award for OCBC Thomson 

Branch and OCBC United Square Branch.

OCBC plans to achieve Green Mark 

Certification for OCBC Campus by 2022 and 

achieve similar status for all the remaining 

retail branches by 2030. We believe greener 

buildings not only reduce our environmental 

impact but also improve employee wellbeing. 

Resilient Workspace 

We recognise the importance in creating 

sustainable, eco-friendly and healthy workspaces 

for our staff and customers. Leading by example, 

Bank of Singapore has achieved our first Green 

Mark Gold award for Office Interior in 2019 and 

targets to achieve the Green Mark Healthier 

Workplace award by early 2022 for all remaining 

Bank of Singapore’s offices. 

A Renovation Guide has also been developed to 

guide our team of interior designers, engineers 

and operations managers. The guide will include 

consideration of the use of energy-efficient 

lighting and equipment to achieve the lowest 

energy consumption, occupancy controls for 

energy conservation and using materials with low 

volatile organic compounds (VOCs) specifications 

to improve air quality. Renovation of offices and 

branches henceforth will take reference from this 

guide to convert our workplaces into spaces that 

are both sustainable for the environment and 

conducive for our staff.

Electric Vehicle Charging Stations

To encourage and enable the adoption of electric 

vehicles, the supporting charging infrastructure 

has to be in place. The OCBC Centre carpark has 

been installed with 10 electric vehicle charging 

stations to facilitate staff and corporate clients in 

their transition to electric vehicles. There are 

further plans to install electric vehicle charging 

facilities at other major Group-owned commercial 

buildings by 2025.

Environmental Footprint







In 2008, OCBC Wing Hang Bank, Hong Kong 

started its Corporate Environmental Responsibility 

(CER) movement, which drove the implementation 

of green environmental protection across its 

operations. It embarked on numerous initiatives 

to reduce waste, conserve energy, and cut carbon 

emissions, aspiring to be a sustainable and 

responsible bank. As a result, OCBC Wing Hang 

Tower (OWT) has won numerous green accolades.

More importantly, OCBC Wing Hang Bank, 

Hong Kong, managed to reduce energy 

consumption significantly by 11.9% between 

2018 and 2020.

(1) Our approach to carbon emissions is aligned to the GHG Protocol Standards, using the operational control approach to determine carbon emissions 

boundaries. The environmental data covers all our operations in Singapore, Malaysia, OCBC NISP in Indonesia, as well as OCBC Wing Hang (China, 

Hong Kong and Macau), unless otherwise stated. 

(2) Emission factors used to calculate carbon emissions are derived from, or in reference to, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 

emission factor database.

(3) We have expanded our carbon inventory in 2021 to include Scope 1 emissions as well as Scope 3 carbon emissions that are material to our operations. 

We do not provide Scope 1 and 3 emission data for previous years as the data is not available.

(4) Scope 1 carbon emissions include direct carbon emissions from backup diesel generators in OCBC premises and carbon emissions from petrol consumption by 

corporate cars. Energy consumption from these non-renewable sources of fuel amounted to approximately 3,305 GJ in 2021.

(5) Scope 2 carbon emissions refer to purchased electricity. OCBC reports Scope 2 carbon emissions using the location-based approach. Emission factor 

source: Energy Market Authority of Singapore, GreenTech Malaysia, Institute of Global Environment Strategies (IGES) - IGES Grid Emission Factors, 

HK Electric, Companhia de Electricidade de Macau, (Indonesia) Directorate General of Electricity.

(6) Energy consumption from electricity consumption, backup diesel generators in OCBC premises and petrol consumption by corporate cars amounted 

to approximately 398,550 GJ in 2021.

(7) We have started disclosing business air travel under our Scope 3 carbon emissions from 2021.

(8) All of our water use is withdrawn from the municipal water supply, consumed within our operations and discharged to the public sewerage system. 

The quality of water withdrawn and discharged is managed by the public utility provider. We recognise that OCBC operates in countries that may be 

water-stressed including Singapore and will therefore continue to do our part to promote water conservation.

(9) We have expanded our 2019 and 2020 data collection for paper usage to include more entities across core markets in line with the carbon emissions 

inventory. This provides a more consistent and complete environmental data collection approach across the Group.

(10) Our paper usage data accounts for paper used within the Group offices for business operations. 

Our commercial buildings, offices and retail branches 

in Singapore are installed with water-efficient 

fittings. As such, OCBC Centre, OCBC Centre East, 

OCBC Centre South, OCBC Tampines Centre One, 

OCBC Tampines Centre Two, Bank of Singapore 

Centre, OCBC Campus and our data centre building 

are certified as Water Efficient Buildings.

Reducing Paper Waste

As part of OCBC’s efforts to reduce resource 

consumption, we encourage customers to switch 

to e-statements. This has resulted in a 16% reduction 

year on year, and an overall reduction of 44% 

since 2016. 

 See page 25 for details on our Sustainable Procurement

Reducing Water Consumption at OCBC

Singapore has limited natural water resources and 

increasingly extreme weather events exacerbate this 

amid a warming planet. As such, water conservation 

is a critical priority in our environmental strategy. 

Water usage decreased by 19% in 2021 compared to 

the previous year as a result of slower global 

operations amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

To support our water conservation efforts, we 

also adopt best practices aligned to BCA’s Green 

Mark certifications to reduce water consumption 

within our premises. This includes providing 

guidance to our tenants, encouraging them to 

use recycled water (NEWater) for irrigation and 

installing water efficiency fittings as well as 

private meters to monitor water consumption.

Why this is Material to Us

Strong governance is the foundation of our success. 

Establishing appropriate control and oversight of 

business operations is essential to our role as a 

steward of wealth and value for our customers and 

society. In line with this view, OCBC’s governance 

framework enables us to build and maintain trust 

among stakeholders, creating long-term and 

sustainable value for them. 

Our Management Approach

We are committed to upholding the highest standards 

of corporate governance in everything we do, guided 

by our groupwide Code of Conduct and Group 

policies. In every jurisdiction that we operate in, 

we comply with all regulations, codes and 

corporate governance guidelines. 

OCBC’s robust corporate governance structure and 

policies are underpinned by its core values, LIFRR 

(Lasting Value, Integrity, Forward-looking, Respect 

and Responsibility). The Board Ethics and Conduct 

Committee is responsible for cultivating and 

maintaining these core values across the organisation, 

anchoring the way employees conduct themselves. 

OCBC takes a zero-tolerance approach to all forms 

of bribery and corruption, which is an integral part 

of the OCBC Code of Conduct. The OCBC Group 

Policy on Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABC) sets 

out its commitment and responsibilities via the 

ABC compliance programme which comprises 

(i) supporting policies and procedures, (ii) risk 

identification and assessment, (iii) training and 

communication, and (iv) reporting channel. The 

compliance programme is reviewed periodically 

to ensure its alignment with global best practices 

and standards. 

OCBC prohibits any political contributions and 

requires all employees to undergo bi-annual 

mandatory ABC awareness training and comply 

with its Gift and Entertainment Disclosure Policy. 

Apart from its employees, OCBC also communicates 

its strong anti-bribery and corruption stance to 

its service providers and suppliers via the ABC 

Notification Guidance and Supplier Code of Conduct.

New Initiatives and Ongoing Efforts

To inculcate a strong ethical sense and good 

corporate governance behaviour, several 

initiatives were launched in 2021.

Sustainability Pillar 3: Acting with Integrity

Strong Governance



Delivering on Our SDGs

OCBC Group Culture and Conduct Programme 

Framework

OCBC has in place a strong governance structure 

and policies to guide employee conduct. In 2021, 

we launched a programme to streamline and 

document the Group’s Culture and Conduct 

Framework via a three-pronged approach. It starts 

with a clear ‘tone from the top’ that cascades down 

to relevant bank-wide policies, programmes, 

processes to promote a robust corporate culture 

among employees, good accountability practices 

and effective conduct risk management. We 

regularly assess whether these objectives are 

met via monitoring and reporting mechanisms. 

The OCBC Culture Stewardship Programme was 

launched in 2020 and seeks to empower younger 

colleagues to lead the charge in building a 

stronger OCBC culture. A total of 70 colleagues 

from across OCBC Bank Singapore, Bank of 

Singapore and OCBC Securities Pte Ltd were 

nominated and formed 10 cross-divisional 

culture stewardship teams to develop solutions 

in achieving seven desired outcomes for a 

stronger OCBC culture. The seven desired 

outcomes included positive reinforcement 

for good conduct, promotion of a “Speak-up” 

culture and counter-balancing the fear of 

internal audit. Over 10 weeks, the teams 

brainstormed, debated and developed their 

ideas to achieve each of the outcomes. Three 

unique proposals were eventually selected 

for implementation.

The teams behind the three winning proposals with our Group CEO 

Helen Wong.

Sustainability Pillar 3: Acting with Integrity

Strong Governance

In the post-Covid-19 environment, OCBC 

Group is gradually resuming on-site operations 

to support economic activities in a safe and 

controlled manner. The Group Pandemic 

Taskforce, supporting the Crisis Management 

Team, centrally coordinated the activities and 

kept operational disruptions to a minimum. 

Strict enforcement of safe management 

measures have also resulted in isolated 

instances of infection.

As the adoption of some hybrid form of remote 

working arrangement becomes prevalent, the 

Bank recognised that associated risks such as 

data loss through mishandling and misconduct 

in an unsupervised environment need to be 

proactively identified and managed. Through 

rigorous assessments on business criticality, 

information confidentiality, surveillance 

over sensitive activities and other factors, 

remote working risks are managed robustly. 

A benchmarking assessment performed 

against the MAS Information Paper on Risk 

Management and Operational Resilience in 

a Remote Working Environment demonstrated 

that the Bank is aligned with all the identified 

key risk areas such as changes in the control 

environment, cyber security, staff misconduct 

and fraud.

Strengthening Corporate Governance Policies 

for a New Normal



Delivering on Our SDGs

Bank Culture and Conduct Dashboard

We developed a dashboard to strengthen the 

corporate governance culture within the Group. 

Our dashboard allows us to get a good sense 

of how OCBC is performing from a culture and 

conduct perspective, allowing the Board and 

management to pre-emptively sieve out concerns 

and demonstrate effective oversight. 

The Culture and Conduct Dashboard comprises 

both qualitative and quantitative indicators. 

These are used to monitor if OCBC is meeting the 

desired outcomes for our stakeholders, such as 

customers, employees, regulators, and the greater 

community. Examples of dashboard indicators 

include customer complaint trends, staff attrition 

rates and conduct risk management indicators.

OCBC Group Conflicts of Interest Policy

OCBC Group Conflicts of Interest Policy was launched 

in 2021 with the objective of establishing key 

principles and standards in identifying, preventing 

or managing conflicts of interest that may adversely 

affect OCBC’s integrity and reputation. Prior approval 

must be sought from the relevant governance 

committee for any conflicts of interest which may 

potentially give rise to significant reputational risk.

Whistleblowing Programme

OCBC is committed to the highest level of integrity  

and ethical standards. Our Whistleblowing Policy 

aims to provide a safe and anonymous platform 

for parties to raise fraud and misconduct concerns. 

The policy also governs the reporting and 

investigation of whistleblowing reports. 

Staff are continually reminded of the policy 

through the mandatory annual anti-fraud 

training that include the policy as a key topic, 

and information that is available internally. 

In 2021, the Bank enhanced the programme by 

publicising the whistleblowing programme and 

also made the whistleblowing channel, which is 

managed independently by an external vendor, 

accessible to the public. A total of 34 anonymous 

and non-anonymous whistleblowing reports 

were received by Group Audit through the various 

reporting channels. The reports were investigated 

independently by Group Audit, with findings 

reported to the Audit Committee.

Employee Conduct Triggers (ECT) Programme

In 2021, we successfully included the Bank of 

Singapore in our ECT programme. The ECT 

programme raises employees’ risk awareness 

and inculcates better risk behaviour by utilising 

clear and measurable conduct indicators to 

measure the Bank’s risk culture. Each employee 

will be accorded ECT points for non-compliance, 

which is subject to management review and can 

lead to disciplinary action.

Sustainable Procurement

OCBC’s Supplier Code of Conduct sets out our 

expectations across key areas: compliance with 

law, business integrity and ethics, human rights, 

health and safety, and environmental protection. 

Suppliers are required to acknowledge the Code 

as part of our supplier onboarding process. 

At OCBC, we take ESG criteria into consideration 

in our procurement evaluation. For instance, our 

environmental requirements incorporate the use 

of recycled material, green certification and energy 

efficiency of equipment, among other criteria. 

Our evaluation process involves a panel of evaluators 

to ensure fairness and openness. The OCBC Code 

of Conduct is to be adhered to where suppliers and 

evaluators are to declare any conflict of interest. 

We also conduct Know-Your-Vendor checks prior 

and during the contract period where vendors are 

screened against a staff database and sanctions 

lists, and via internet searches to detect any 

potential violation of OCBC’s policies.

Product Suitability Committee, Policy and Framework

This Framework governs the approval of new 

investment products, ensuring suitability for the 

target customer segments. The Product Suitability 

Committee is responsible for screening the 

suitability of investment products using OCBC’s 

Product Suitability Risk Rating Methodology. This 

methodology considers the risk factors for new 

investment products and the risk profiles of the 

target customers. Products are recommended 

based on the alignment of risk profiles of 

customers and product risks.

Additionally, product managers are required 

to take a test to ensure that they are well-versed 

in OCBC’s product suitability policy before they can 

propose new products to the committee. Overall, 

the Framework strengthens the transparency and 

comprehensiveness of our risk disclosures to 

ensure fair pricing and mitigate risks for consumers. 

Sustainability Pillar 3: Acting with Integrity

Fair Dealing

Why this is Material to Us

The OCBC Group brand name is synonymous 

with honesty and integrity. We continue to 

uphold the trust and confidence that customers 

place in us by maintaining the highest level of 

integrity and ethical standards in all that we do. 

Our brand promise – ‘Simply Spot On’ – underscores 

our commitment to take a long-term approach 

in building enduring customer relationships. 

We seek to act in customers’ best interest by 

understanding their needs, which enables us 

to deliver the right advice and solutions.

Our Management Approach

Fair dealing is a core part of our corporate culture. 

Our core values of ‘Lasting Value, Integrity, 

Forward-looking, Respect and Responsibility’ 

underpin our commitment to always do the 

right things for our customers. To fulfil this 

commitment, we:

• provide our customers with clear, relevant 

and timely information to help them make 

informed decisions;

• recommend products that are aligned with 

our customers’ financial objectives and 

risk profiles;

• deepen our sales employees’ knowledge and 

competencies so they can give appropriate 

advice and recommendations; and

• address customers’ feedback and complaints 

promptly and effectively.

We review and improve our practices regularly, 

striving to go beyond compliance with the 

Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Fair 

Dealing Guidelines. 

New Initiatives and Ongoing Efforts

Fair Dealing Committee, Framework and 

Monitoring Programme

A Monitoring Programme has been put in 

place to oversee our initiatives and conduct to 

ensure fair dealing is an integral part of our 

interactions with customers. The programme 

aims to measure and monitor our performance 

against the fair dealing outcomes set out by the 

MAS using quantitative and qualitative indicators. 

The Fair Dealing Committee, which includes 

division heads from various business units, uses 

the findings from this programme to determine 

the fair dealing performance of the Group.

The quantitative indicators in the Monitoring 

Programme comprise the number of misconduct 

cases reported to the MAS, audit results, 

compensation amounts arising from mis-selling 

and the MAS Balanced Scorecard results, covering 

financial, operational and business areas. Qualitative 

indicators are also included to reflect how systemic 

the cases of misconduct are. This grading system

Fair Dealing

We have a rigorous checks and balances system 

in place for vulnerable customers, especially 

customers who are aged above 62 years and 

those with special needs. This includes prohibiting 

the recommendation of certain complex 

investment products, such as perpetual bonds 

and Loss Absorbing Capital Instruments, to 

customers who are aged 62 years old and above. 

Not only do we provide customers with all 

product risks and features at point of sale, 

we continue to do so after that as well. This 

ensures that customers are kept abreast of 

the investment performance and any material 

developments affecting their investments. 

Doing so enables customers to make changes 

to their investments where necessary. 

Investment Products that Meet our Customers’ Needs

Weekly updated research views are available to 

customers via our mobile application. We also 

use automated notifications to ensure customers 

continue to receive clear, relevant and timely 

information to help them make informed 

decisions even during periods of increased 

market volatility and uncertainty. 

An in-house digital system was developed to enable the prompt dissemination of key market developments and adverse news to customers via SMS 

and email notifications. 



Vulnerable customers aged 62 years old and above are not allowed to 

buy perpetual bonds as a rule. If the customer insists on buying such 

an investment product, the customer must fulfil additional pre- and 

post-sale checks that ensure full understanding of the risks before 

being allowed to buy it by choice and against the Bank’s recommendation.

Combating Financial Crimes and Cyber Threats

Our internal controls include the following measures:

• Restrict accesses on a need-to-know basis

• Incorporate regular monitoring to facilitate 

prompt detection and follow-up of possible 

data breaches

• Broadcast updates on evolving threats  

(e.g. phishing and ransomware) to raise 

staff vigilance

In addition, we have continued to implement 

progressive enhancements, such as further 

strengthening of endpoint data loss prevention 

controls, to enable adequate data protection 

in the new norm of remote working.

Anti-money Laundering (AML) Measures

Since 2019, OCBC Singapore and participating 

Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) have collaborated 

in successful efforts to automate the handling of 

a production order to reduce turnaround time by 

99% to one to two days. 

The initiative, with further enhancements ongoing 

to processes and retrieval timeline, has helped 

the LEAs and banks work together to detect and 

investigate suspicious trends and patterns quickly 

and effectively. This helps in combating financial 

crime and mitigate money laundering risks. 

OCBC’s continuous efforts to increase risk 

awareness among staff have allowed for early 

detection of money laundering, terrorist financing, 

and sanctions risks and for swift and proactive risk 

mitigation actions to be taken. In June 2021, the 

Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) awarded 

the Community Partnership Award to OCBC 

Why this is Material to Us

Financial crimes and cyber threats can potentially 

disrupt banking services and result in financial 

losses impacting customers, our organisation 

and the broader economy. The continuous 

evolution of technology and digitalisation of 

products and services means that we will 

continue to face increased risks of cyber-attacks, 

data breaches, fraud, money laundering and the 

financing of terrorism. It is pivotal for the Bank 

to stay resilient against these risks.

Our Management Approach

We take a holistic approach to managing 

financial crimes and cyber threats, implementing 

measures covering risk governance, people, 

process, and technology. Our robust processes 

have helped to protect customers' information 

and assets from financial crime and cyber threats. 

We will continue to proactively invest in new 

technologies to mitigate cyber threats and 

financial crimes. 

The ongoing global pandemic has necessitated 

continued large-scale remote working arrangements 

and heightened the need to engage our customers 

digitally. As a result, our internal controls and 

risk management processes continue to be 

progressively strengthened to support the 

increased volume of digitalisation initiatives 

to serve our customers better.

OCBC also makes active efforts to strengthen 

the cyber resilience of the wider community. 

We partner with industry players to actively 

gather cyber threat intelligence, as well as 

collaborate with law enforcement agencies 

and other financial institutions to collectively 

combat financial crimes and cyber threats. 

New Initiatives and Ongoing Efforts

Anti-Fraud Measures

In 2021, we continued to raise scam awareness 

among customers and employees via multiple 

channels, including internet and mobile 

banking, social media, direct electronic mails, 

and webinars. 

In May 2021, we collaborated with the National 

Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) to launch an 

online scam quiz for retail customers. We assisted 

NCPC in broadcasting this to our customers via 

email, push notification and OCBC website. OCBC 

also partnered with the Singapore Police Force’s 

Anti-Scam Centre in Project FRONTIER to combat 

scams through swift interventions and intervene 

in fake gambling and investment scam cases.

Internally, we have further deployed fraud 

surveillance and anti-financial malware system 

across the Group. This will enhance security 

for our customers through the monitoring and 

alerting customers of suspicious transactions. 

The Bank also continuously identifies new fraud 

risks and implement enhanced internal controls 

to mitigate the risk of fraud.

Preventing Data Breaches

As most staff worked remotely during the year, 

data protection is of paramount importance. 

OCBC has in place comprehensive measures 

to prevent data breaches.

100% of employees completed mandatory AML 

and CFT training and assessment in 2021 (1)

100% inclusion of employees in the Social Engineering 

Test Programme in 2021

100% of employees completed the Annual Cyber 

and Information Risk Awareness Online Training 

and Assessment course in 2021 (1)

(1) The training performance includes employees from OCBC Singapore 

and international branches (excludes employees who are on Long 

Term Medical, Sabbatical leave etc).

Sustainability Pillar 3: Acting with Integrity

Combating Financial Crimes and Cyber Threats

Enhancing the Cyber Vigilance of Ecosystem Partners

The continued extensive remote working due 

to the global pandemic and the increasing trend 

of cyber-attacks against third-party organisations 

necessitate the continuous enhancing of the cyber 

vigilance of our ecosystem partners. We organised 

a webinar on “Taking Action to Enhance 

Operational Resilience” for our third-party 

service providers, where 132 participants from 

21 companies were equipped with leading 

cybersecurity practices. 

We continued to enhance the cyber vigilance of 

our customers through publication of advisories 

and alerts via various channels to heighten our 

customers' cyber awareness and alertness to 

various modes of scam attacks.

Strengthening the Anti-fraud Detection and Prevention Measures

We have seen an increased risk of customers 

falling victim to scams such as the recent and 

unprecedented SMS phishing scam where the 

fraudsters were especially sophisticated in 

exploiting customers’ concerns related to the 

security and status of their accounts. Given the 

circumstances of the SMS phishing scam, the 

Bank has made full goodwill payouts to customers 

affected by this scam. 

While our banking systems and digital banking 

platforms are safe and secure, the Bank continues 

to enhance its security measures; these include 

those introduced by the Association of Banks in 

Singapore (ABS) and the Monetary Authority of 

Singapore (MAS) on 19 January 2022 to bolster 

the security of digital banking. Among the measures 

are a 24-hour cooling off period for both digital 

token provisioning and key account changes, a 

‘kill switch’ that enables customers to immediately 

freeze all their current and savings accounts in an 

emergency, a dedicated customer service care team 

as well as a fraud hotline to handle customer 

queries and reports on fraud and suspected scams 

and increased customer awareness campaigns. 

We have also engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers 

Risk Services Ptd Ltd to perform an independent 

review of the incident and will be implementing 

their recommendations when issued, to enhance 

countermeasures against scams, as well as to 

strengthen our fraud surveillance and responses. 

Together with ABS and MAS, the Bank and the 

industry will continue to review and strengthen 

fraud detection and prevention measures.

61 awards received from the Singapore Police Force

who were victims of various scams such as business 

email compromise, impersonation scams, investment 

scams and love scams

Cyber Resilience

Under this heading, we:

• proactively review and update technology and 

cyber risk management policies and standards 

in accordance with an evolving risk landscape 

and regulatory requirements; 

• review and strengthen OCBC’s preventive, 

detective, and response capabilities to enhance 

the Bank’s cyber resilience, covering several areas 

such as advanced malware protection, access 

control management and management of cyber 

risks arising from the Bank’s third-party service 

providers, which include cloud services, to better 

address the evolving cyber threat landscape;

• perform regular vulnerability assessments and 

penetration tests of the Bank’s IT systems to 

continuously review their robustness. Incident 

response as well as disaster recovery exercises 

are also conducted to validate the Bank’s 

cyber resilience; and

• embarked on the next step in transforming 

people to be the strongest defence with a 

new Cyber Smart Programme, a sustainable 

and strategic initiative to elevate employees’ 

knowledge, skills and demonstrated behaviour 

in managing risks associated with social 

engineering, data loss and cybersecurity.

Sustainability Pillar 4: Valuing Our People

Employee Health, Safety and Wellbeing



Delivering on Our SDGs

Why this is Material to Us

The success of our business requires a healthy, 

resilient, connected and engaged workforce. 

As the nature of work and the workplace changes 

in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have a 

responsibility to our employees to provide a 

workplace that is safe, supports mental and 

physical health, and enables employees to 

have a fulfilling life beyond the workplace. 

It is also important that they remain connected 

and engaged with fellow colleagues, building 

trust and a sense of purpose at the workplace.

Our Management Approach

We will continue to prioritise the health, 

safety and wellbeing of our employees. This is 

supported by our robust policies and practices, 

which include tools that enable us to detect 

and respond to external threats such as terrorism, 

natural hazards, cross border conflicts or civil 

unrest that may impact the safety of our 

employees and operational continuity of the 

group globally. The Global Incident Management 

Centre provides the Bank with enhanced incident 

situational awareness, employing advanced 

technology services customised to our global 

footprint. This serves as the trigger for mitigating 

actions to events that may potentially have a 

severe impact to the Group.

In 2021, the Group responded to the civil unrest 

in Myanmar and ensured the safety for our 

employees while maintaining banking services 

for our customers. At the height of the crisis, 

local staff were provided with food, medical 

essentials and accommodation. The Bank also 

transformed operational processes to ensure 

customers in Myanmar continued to have 

access to banking services and financing.

New Initiatives and Ongoing Efforts

Operational Resiliency Amid Covid-19

As governments across the world continued to 

respond to the global pandemic in 2021, the Bank’s 

key focus was enhancing operational resiliency 

against Covid-19. The Group’s Pandemic Taskforce 

had weekly meetings and the Group’s Crisis 

Management Team convened to determine key 

policy decisions that provided a proactive response 

to the pandemic. The Group further enhanced its 

operational resiliency in three ways:

• A Pandemic-resilient Workforce: Our staff are 

our greatest asset; the progressive rollout of 

vaccinations protected them while ensuring 

business continuity. Staff were encouraged 

to be vaccinated and the Bank arranged talks 

by medical professionals to address any concerns. 

Policies were also rolled out to support vaccination 

including days off, working from home in the 

week they are vaccinated, medical leave without 

the need to produce a medical certificate, hospital 

coverage and transport claims. The Bank was 

among the first to collate staff vaccination data 

and, across the Group, 99% of our employees have 

completed the primary vaccination series as 

at end December 2021.

• Environmental Hygiene: Ensuring a hygienic 

environment is a critical component of the Bank's 

strategy in managing the pandemic outbreak. 

As Singapore’s national infection rate of Covid-19 

increased in the 3rd quarter of 2021, all employees 

were required to conduct self-administered 

Antigen Rapid Test (ART) and comply with all 

existing Safe Management Measures if they 

wished to return to the office.

• Transforming Work Arrangements: One of 

the key lessons learnt in the first year of the 

pandemic was the value of reducing physical 

contact and concentration risk. While safe 

distancing remained in force through 2021, 

the Bank further enhanced its business continuity 

plans, increased split operations and transformed 

onsite operations to enable remote working. 

The Group continues to take a forward-looking 

approach and is developing its future workspaces 

to support hybrid work arrangements, incorporating 

many lessons learnt from the pandemic.

MyWellness Fiesta 2021

In an effort to promote holistic wellness, we 

organised workshops on four pillars of wellness: 

physical, mental, social and financial wellbeing 

as well as sustainability-related topics under the 

banner of MyWellness Fiesta. This initiative aims 

to inspire employees to adopt the right mindset 

to live well and sustainably. 

Over a 5-week period, activities such as talks, 

quizzes, photo activities and sessions with 

nutritionists were held virtually. Participants 

were also provided with online resources to practise 

a sustainable lifestyle. A total of 7,331 employees 

attended MyWellness Fiesta across the Group. 

MyWellness Enabled

To further support employee wellbeing, OCBC 

has engaged a global mental wellness solution 

provider to provide high-quality and consistent 

services. This programme provides employees 

with both preventive care and clinical support 

to boost personal and professional growth. It is 

available at all hours, in multiple languages, 

to employees and their family members.

MyWellness Enabled offers a wide range of services, 

which includes online resources, training, webinars 

and wellness programme series as well as counselling 

and coaching support. This programme is currently 

available to all employees across 17 countries.

Inclusive Workforce

Why this is Material to Us

An inclusive and diverse workforce is important 

for an organisation to thrive in the face of disruptions. 

At OCBC, we continuously build an inclusive culture 

that embraces diversity, treats employees fairly 

and provides equal opportunities. Such a culture 

is crucial to our long-term success as it fosters 

innovation and creativity.

Our Management Approach

We seek to recognise each employee and his or 

her value to the Bank. This means cultivating a 

supportive environment so employees can maximise 

their potential given their individual circumstances. 

This includes providing learning and development 

opportunities for employees while providing an 

avenue for feedback via formal channels and 

encouraging real-time feedback. 

New Initiatives and Ongoing Efforts 

OCBC Fair Recruitment Practices and Hiring Policy

To build our inclusive work environment, 

we focus on maintaining a gender-equal 

workforce. We strive to increase the 

representation of women in OCBC, helping 

women reach leadership roles and achieve 

their full potential as they build a rewarding 

and successful career with OCBC.

We are an equal-opportunity employer 

aligned to the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair 

Employment Practices issued by the Tripartite 

Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment 

Practices (TAFEP). The Fair Employment 

Practices are centred around the recruitment 

and selection of employees based on merit.

(1) Statistics include permanent and contract staff at OCBC Group, excluding OCBC Capital Malaysia Berhad.

(2) We have included the performance of Great Eastern Holdings as part of OCBC Group. 

(3) This comprises permanent staff from Singapore (36%), Malaysia (25%), Greater China (14%), Indonesia (20%), and the rest of the world (2%), as well as contract staff from Singapore (2%), and Malaysia, Greater China, Indonesia

To further cultivate an inclusive workplace, 

we ensure that our recruitment process reflects 

our diverse and inclusive approach. We:

• removed biased language and terminology 

from all relevant documentation;

• developed gender-neutral job specifications, 

recruiting collaterals and advertisements. 

All final versions of advertisement copy are 

reviewed internally for any unintended bias;

• ensured roles are advertised through multiple 

media channels; and

• expanded outreach platforms to ensure 

diversity in job applicants.

Our hiring policy applies to everyone we directly 

employ in our core markets. In addition, subsidiaries 

may have varying conditions according to their 

local regulations.

Reverse Mentoring

OCBC Bank has a strong mentoring culture. Since 2018, more than 120 mentors have volunteered in various mentoring programmes championed by Group Human Resources. The Bank deliberately pairs 

individuals from different age groups – the mentor being the senior employee – to foster greater shared experience and understanding across the organisation. Through these organic experiences, our senior 

staff are reaping an unexpected benefit by being reverse mentored by much younger mentees. We featured four pairs from different divisions and regions in our communications to Group staff where both 

mentor and mentee gained from their relationship.

Both Jason and Malie learned a lot from the 

shared experience. With Jason, Malie shared his 

knowledge of the possibilities and limitations of 

technology and how social trends in technology 

would affect the human resource environment. 

This knowledge served to be useful for Jason to 

drive the digital HR transformation journey. Malie 

enjoyed the opportunity to hear thoughts directly 

from a senior leader and learned from the process 

of reframing his mind to speak in an engaging 

manner and prepare information that is relevant, 

insightful and digestible. 

Despite their age gap, Betty and Edbert hit it off 

immediately. Edbert offered fresh and daring ideas, 

offering different perspectives and ways of thinking 

about solutions. As a firm believer in learning from 

the younger generation, Betty gained refreshing 

new ideas from communicating with Edbert which 

is useful for business transformation. With the 

genuine two-way listening and learning, Edbert 

appreciated Betty’s candour and learnt to be more 

confident in communicating, although only in the 

early part of his career. 

Teresa enjoys her time interacting with Catherine. 

She learns what the younger workforce thinks and 

how to better communicate with them, becoming 

a better leader in the process. Sharing personal 

goals, embracing change through a growth mindset 

and adapting to the new normal during Covid-19 

also deepen their understanding and sense of 

connection. At the same time, Catherine felt 

affirmed and of value through Teresa’s leadership. 

Lai Lin provides a safe space for Edwina to voice 

her views without fear of judgement and keeps an 

open mind. Edwina shares a different viewpoint 

frankly and respectfully which Lai Lin thoroughly 

appreciates. Edwina enjoys this autonomy and 

in turn, has stepped up and given lots of guidance 

to Lai Lin in terms of data analytics, digitalisation 

and dashboards. Between them, they can learn 

from each other in different ways.

Talent Management 

Why this is Material to Us

Our talent is our most important asset. We believe 

that the best organisations thrive because of the 

strength of their people. We must continue to 

attract, retain, and develop our talent to ensure 

we are future-ready.

Our Management Approach

We recognise our responsibility to develop 

employees throughout their careers. We are 

focused on cultivating a learning culture that 

prioritises holistic development, helping employees 

realise their full potential both professionally and 

personally. We also strive to build sustainability-

related skills in our workforce in line with our goal 

to become a regional leader in responsible banking.

New Initiatives and Ongoing Efforts 

Fostering A Strong Learning Organisation

A strong learning organisation is the foundation 

for sustained people development and business 

growth. The OCBC Group Learning Blueprint 

is the first ever artefact of our learning culture, 

reflecting the state of learning and the collective 

aspirations of our people, and codifying the 

principles of learning to further perpetuate our 

strong learning culture by design.

OCBC committed S$20 million in the first phase 

of OCBC Future Smart in 2018. A total of 1,900 

programmes were developed, and employees 

completed over 178,000 programmes since then. 

As part of the second phase of OCBC Future Smart, 

we will invest S$30 million over the next three 

years to upskill 30,000 employees across OCBC.

In 2021, we introduced more than 20 new 

Sustainability learning programmes to help 

employees gain knowledge and skills for application 

in their roles. These programmes are aligned to 

the Group’s sustainability strategy and material 

ESG factors, addressing topics such as carbon 

footprint, climate risks, sustainability financing 

and investing, as well as environmental protection.

Employees will be equipped with technical expertise 

to manage sustainability-related transactions, 

design new products and innovations, as well as 

engage effectively with customers to transition to 

a more sustainable world. The learning programmes 

are extended to all employees in our core markets. 

This will help groom subject matter experts within 

the Group to enhance our sustainability push. In 

2021, more than 13,000 attendees participated 

in sustainability programmes, with over 80% 

reporting new knowledge gained on sustainability.

Future Smart Certification Programmes

We have developed 13 certification programmes 

for our employees to acquire knowledge that 

can help to expand their roles or even switch to 

new roles to meet future industry needs. The 

programmes cover areas such as data, cybersecurity, 

risk management, corporate banking, wealth 

management, among other skills development 

areas. These programmes are also accredited to 

industry standards.

Five new certification programmes were added 

in 2021. These include the Customer Centricity 

Pathway and the Digital Marketing Pathway. 

These are broad-based programmes that aim 

to build the relevant competencies that can be 

applied across businesses and roles. As of 2021, 

we have 1,636 participants who have completed 

Certification Programmes.

Future Smart Learning Festival

The Future Smart Learning Festival 2021 was 

organised between July and September to 

celebrate OCBC’s transformational work and to 

motivate our employees in their learning journeys. 

The festival was filled with exciting speaker sessions 

and experiential activities. Our Group CEO and 

Future Smart sponsor, Ms. Helen Wong, opened 

the Learning Festival. She also interacted with 

employees and gave insights into her professional 

and personal life through the questions posted 

by employees during the festival.

The theme for this year’s Learning Festival was 

“Level Up with Future Smart”, with 17 different 

talks conducted by internal and external subject 

matter experts around the world, spanning key 

topics covered under Future Smart.

Anchored in Leadership

At OCBC, it is important that talent management 

programmes are driven by senior leaders. This 

ensures continuation and relevance of the 

programmes in developing a first-class workforce.

Senior Management Sponsors driving OCBC’s 

talent development programmes:

• Helen Wong – MentorMe Programme for 

mentees and mentors

• Dato’ Ong Eng Bin – Campus Star Awards 

for internal trainers 

• Ching Wei Hong – BOLD Programme for  

C-2 leaders and Senior Vice Presidents

• Loretta Yuen – LEAD Programme for Vice Presidents

• Sunny Quek and Eugene Lau – Trust Series for 

people managers

Our Leadership Programmes

We curated and designed an extensive suite 

of programmes for our leaders to continue 

building the leadership pipeline for the Group. 

We have seen strong uptakes of our core 

leadership programmes:

• MentorMe Programme: Launched in 2018 to 

widen our female talent pool, the programme 

aims to help mentees develop networking skills 

and confidence to speak within and beyond the 

organisation. All mentees in the programme 

are female, while mentors can be of any gender. 

Following the success of the programme in 

Singapore, the programme was expanded 

to Malaysia as one of their women initiatives 

programmes in 2020.

• BOLD Programme: A 7-month flagship 

leadership programme jointly developed 

and facilitated by IESE Business School in 

Spain. It focuses on deepening leadership skills 

for our senior leaders, covering topics such as 

agility, sustainability, digital transformation 

and legacy building. This programme empowers 

senior leaders to overcome the increasingly 

complex challenges that emerge in this 

fast-changing world. Participants will expand 

their ability to build collaborative teams, 

champion change, and create a culture of 

high performance. As at end-2021, there are 

a total of 65 participants in the programme.

• LEAD Programme: Aims to strengthen the 

leadership pipeline for mid to senior level 

leaders across the Bank and equip leaders 

with skills and knowledge to thrive in the 

increasingly complex world. In partnership 

with the National University of Singapore (NUS), 

the 3-month journey builds core leadership 

competencies such as Leading Courageously, 

Adaptability, Building Talent, Fostering 

Collaboration and Strategic Thinking. 

Participants have the opportunity to 

collaborate across OCBC Group, harness 

one another’s strengths and sharpen their 

strategic thinking. As at end-2021, there are 

a total of 232 participants in the programme.

Talent Management 

OCBC started a talent development programme 

called FRANKpreneurs to empower graduates 

to impact the banking world of today and 

the future.

The 16-week summer internship allows 

graduates to work in cross-divisional groups 

across OCBC to generate future-oriented 

solutions to meet real world challenges. 

They are mentored by industry leaders 

and equipped with entrepreneurship tools 

to work on collaborative projects. Each year, 

teams developed innovative banking

Cultivating Innovation in the Group

solutions aligned to an annual theme provided 

by OCBC. A new travel app launched by OCBC 

in 2021 was a result of this programme.

In 2021, participants were given a business 

challenge, which comprised three main 

themes – 1. Digital Banking; 2. Sustainability;  

3. Post-Covid-19 environment. The themes are 

in line with OCBC’s organisational strategy to 

be a leading regional bank in this post-Covid-19 

environment by leveraging on its sustainability 

and digital banking efforts.



Delivering on Our SDGs

• DARE Programme: DARE is a core Leadership 

Programme that aims to build key leadership 

competencies through an exploratory leadership 

journey. The programme focuses on self-leadership 

and collaboration and prepares participants 

for leadership roles by increasing their exposure 

to global issues that impacts the business. As at 

end-2021, there are a total of 201 participants 

in the programme. 

• “W Suite” and “M Suite”: Tailored programmes 

for OCBC’s Senior Management Leaders. The 

programme aims to support senior leaders in 

their executive roles. These workshops explore 

topics ranging from building a confident 

presence to being a role model.

• INSEAD EDP: Since 2007, we conduct an annual 

Executive Development Programme in 

partnership with INSEAD for employees 

who are Vice President (or equivalent) level 

to prepare them for senior positions. To date, 

there are 480 participants. The programme 

aims to open the minds of the participants 

on the business environment &amp; strategy and 

encourage them to venture beyond their 

specialised areas to think enterprisingly and 

lead differently in the new normal. This year, 

the programme is curated to ensure a greater 

focus on ‘Sustainability’ and included a new 

topic on ‘Customer Value Creation through 

Data Analytics’. Also, instead of the overseas 

immersion, virtual guest speakers’ series were 

organised between Module 1 and Module 2.

• NTU EDP: Starting from 2019, we conduct an 

annual 2-week leadership development 

programme in partnership with Nanyang 

Technological University (NTU) for employees 

who are Assistant Vice President (or equivalent) 

level. There are 137 participants to date. The key 

focus of the programme is to help participants

Employee Engagement Survey 

Our Employee Engagement Survey (1) was refreshed 

to track employee experience across five aspects: 

(1) Horizontal Collaboration, (2) Trust, Integrity and 

Accountability, (3) Speak-up Culture, (4) Safe and 

Secure Workplace Environment and (5) Talent 

Development. Since 2017, we conduct the employee 

engagment survey on a biennial basis. Due to 

Covid-19, the employee engagement survey 

was conducted in 2021 instead. 

(1) The percentage score reflects the proportion of employees in the 

organisation who will speak positively about their work experience, 

be motivated to contribute more and stay with the organisation.The 

statistics reflect the engagement scores of OCBC Group employees 

excluding Great Eastern Holdings.

Sustainability Pillar 5: Engaging Communities

Community Development

Why this is Material to Us

We recognise that our long-term success is 

interwoven with the wellbeing of society. That 

is why giving back to society is an essential part 

of OCBC’s corporate culture. By engaging and 

supporting the communities in the markets 

we operate in, we can develop a sustainable 

future for all.

Our Management Approach

We remain committed to supporting underserved 

communities across our core markets. By leveraging 

the Group’s resources, we continue to address 

challenges and unmet needs in society. This is 

funded through our #OCBCCares programme. 

We focus on making a difference through 

targeted programmes in four thematic areas, 

in line with the Group’s sustainability strategy 

and our commitment to the SDGs: 

• Families: Supporting cohesive and healthy 

communities 

• The Elderly: Meeting the health and social 

interaction needs of an ageing population 

• Persons with Special Needs: Encouraging 

social inclusion and acceptance 

• Environmental Sustainability: Promoting 

environmentally responsible behaviour and 

reducing carbon emissions as part of our 

climate action strategy

In 2021, a key focus for our efforts has been 

on environmental sustainability, in line with 

the Group’s Climate Strategy to lead and 

accelerate the transition to a low-carbon 

future for all.

New Initiatives and Ongoing Efforts

Supporting Food Security for Low-income Families

We introduced several initiatives to support 

families and individuals who struggled to get 

sufficient, safe and nutritious food due to rising 

food prices and reduced incomes due to the 

pandemic. In Singapore, we helped set up two 

shop-for-free community shops that offered more 

than 1,500 families the option of taking only what 

they needed from these shops, minimising 

duplication and mismatch of food donations. 

Our volunteers in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia helped 

raise funds to purchase and pack food and essential 

goods for more than 1,500 low-income families. 

We placed these supplies in three selected locations 

in Jalan Gasing, Taman Mayang and Kota Damansara 

for families to collect when needed. 

Similarly, our volunteers in Hong Kong collected 

basic food items for low-income families. Over a 

span of two weeks, we collected more than 800 kg 

of food supplies for more than 4,000 individuals 

who may not have regular access to food.

Helping Seniors to Embrace Technology and 

Promote Social Interaction

To support the mental wellbeing of seniors who 

had kept to their homes during the pandemic, 

our Singapore volunteers organised regular virtual 

activities to promote social interaction. One such 

event saw 60 seniors attending a virtual durian 

party. With frequent practice, the seniors have 

become accustomed to embracing once-unfamiliar 

technologies to connect, interact and build 

emotional ties with one another. 

In China, our volunteers supported seniors in 

various activities to help them stay abreast of 

social changes and to empower them to 

contribute to society. These activities ranged from 

enabling them to support a low-carbon world 

through recycling to organising digital and risk 

prevention workshops to ensure they do not 

fall prey to scams.





Delivering on Our SDGs

857,292 individuals supported since 2017 when we 

launched our #OCBCCares Programme. On track to meet 

our target of helping 1 million vulnerable individuals

opportunities, we continued to contribute funds 

and skills to support disadvantaged segments of the 

community

• 275,552 individuals supported

• S$3.2 million donated

• 12,984 volunteers

• 59,272 volunteer hours contributed by our staff

Delivering on Our SDGs

After the success of Singapore’s first community 

shop at Mountbatten in 2020, we partnered 

Food from the Heart (FFTH) to set up a second 

shop at Boon Lay. More than 1,500 families 

now have the option to take only what they 

need from these shops, minimising duplication 

and mismatch of food donations. 

This shop-for-free concept offers beneficiaries 

the dignity to shop freely with more diverse 

options. They can select 12 food items from 

the shop each month. 

Staff volunteers from our customer analytics 

and decisioning team taught staff of FFTH 

how to apply analytics insights to improve

operations at the shops, from tracking food 

redemption patterns and stocking relevant 

food supplies to optimising shelf space usage.

A dipstick survey had shown that this community 

shop initiative has helped reduce the mismatch 

of food donations, with 73% of the respondents 

indicating that they knew what they wanted 

to redeem when they visit the shop. 

One of the beneficiaries, Mr. Ahmad Maricar 

Bin Abdul Maricar, 82, shared, “The shop has 

plenty of useful items to choose from, and 

I can even select the brands. I look forward 

to shopping there every month.”





Food from the Heart (FFTH) Community Shop

OCBC contributed S$1 million to fund pre-school 

education for 2,500 children from needy 

families in Singapore from 2020 to 2024 after 

learning that some families still struggle with 

educational cost despite hefty government 

subsidies. Our funding covers nutritional 

needs as well as language, social and cognitive 

programmes for these children. Volunteers 

from our wealth management business also 

conducted financial literacy classes for 

parents to help them manage their finances 

more efficiently. 

To date, 948 children have received support 

under this programme and 81 families have 

attended the financial literacy classes. The 

educators reported that children who attended 

the programme saw improvement in numeracy 

skills and social interaction, while parents have 

become more confident in managing their 

finances to meet their families’ needs.

Each child received a one-time payout of S$400 

into their Child Development Account (CDA). 

This was matched equally by the Singapore 

government under the Baby Bonus Scheme. 

After paying the relevant fees per month, 

the remaining money can be used for other 

educational and healthcare expenses approved 

under the Baby Bonus Scheme. 

"The funding received in my daughter's CDA 

has greatly benefited us as it will help to offset 

school fees and reduce some financial stress 

on my family. 

I participated in the OCBC Financial Literacy 

workshop, which has helped me understand 

the importance of saving and prioritising my 

spending. I also learned how to better manage 

my monthly budgeting. I am glad I attended the 

workshop.” shared Christabel's father, whose 

daughter is a beneficiary of the OCBC-NTUC 

First Campus Bridging Programme.

OCBC-NTUC First Campus Bridging Programme

Introduced in 2020, the OCBC-NTUC First Campus Bridging 

Programme will fund pre-school education for an estimated 500 

children each year, making it a total of 2,500 children by 2024.

Giving families choice to take only what they need from the community shops has helped reduce duplication and mismatch of food donations.

Why this is Material to Us

OCBC has a wide geographical footprint 

in Asia. We recognise the way we do our 

business will have a long-term impact on 

the development of the environment and 

society. To build and maintain public trust, 

we must be transparent about our economic 

value creation and distribution across 

different stakeholder groups. 

Our Management Approach

In addition to providing financial solutions, 

OCBC plays its role in supporting the local 

economy through fair and progressive 

compensation to employees, taxes to 

respective authorities and dividends to 

shareholders. We prioritise sourcing from 

local suppliers to support the economy in 

our core markets (1). We have also established 

policies, frameworks, procedures and 

processes to ensure that we are disciplined 

and responsible in our goal to drive long-term 

positive impacts for stakeholders.

Independent Practitioner’s Limited Assurance Report

INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONER’S LIMITED ASSURANCE REPORT ON SUSTAINABILITY INFORMATION 

OF OVERSEA-CHINESE BANKING CORPORATION LIMITED 

We have been engaged by Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (the “Company” or “OCBC”) 

to undertake a limited assurance engagement in respect of the selected sustainability information from 

the 2021 Sustainability Report of the Company described below for the year ended 31 December 2021 

(“the Identified Sustainability Information”).

Identified Sustainability Information

The respective Identified Sustainability Information for the year ended 31 December 2021 is set out below:

1. GRI 102-8: Information on employees and other workers

2. GRI 201-1: Direct economic value generated and distributed

3. GRI 204-1: Proportion of spending on local suppliers

4. GRI 302-1: Energy consumption within the organisation

5. GRI 305-1: Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions

6. GRI 305-2: Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions

7. GRI 401-1: New employee hires and employee turnover

8. GRI 404-1: Average hours of training per year per employee 

Our assurance engagement was with respect to the year ended 31 December 2021. We have not 

performed any procedures with respect to (i) earlier periods and (ii) any other elements included in 

the Company’s 2021 Sustainability Report, and in the annual report, website and other publications, 

and therefore do not express any conclusion thereon.

Reporting Criteria

The Identified Sustainability Information has been assessed against the Global Reporting Initiative 

(“GRI”) Sustainability Reporting Standards 2020 (“the Reporting Criteria”).

Management’s Responsibility for the Identified Sustainability Information

Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability 

Information in accordance with the Reporting Criteria. The responsibility includes designing, 

implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation of Identified 

Sustainability Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Practitioner’s Independence and Quality Control

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Accounting 

and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public 

Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles 

of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and 

professional behaviour. 

Our firm applies Singapore Standard on Quality Control 1 and, accordingly, maintains a 

comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures 

regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal 

and regulatory requirements.

Practitioner’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Identified Sustainability 

Information based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. 

We performed our limited assurance engagement in accordance with Singapore Standard on 

Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) – Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews 

of Historical Financial Information and, in respect of greenhouse gas emissions included in the 

Identified Sustainability Information, Singapore Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 – 

Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements (“SSAE 3410”) (collectively the “Standards”). 

These Standards require that we plan and perform our work to form the conclusion about whether 

the Identified Sustainability Information is free from material misstatement. The extent of our 

procedures depends on our professional judgment and our assessment of the engagement risk. 

A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the 

Company’s use of the Reporting Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability 

Information, assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information 

whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and 

evaluating the overall presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information. A limited assurance 

engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both 

the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures 

performed in response to the assessed risks.

Independent Practitioner’s Limited Assurance Report

The procedures selected included inquiries, observation of processes performed, inspection of 

documents, analytical procedures, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods 

and reporting policies, and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records. Given the circumstances 

of the engagement, we also performed the following:

• interviewed management and personnel in Group Operations &amp; Technology, Property Services, 

and Human Resources departments in relation to the Identified Sustainability Information; 

• obtained an understanding of how the Identified Sustainability Information is gathered, 

collated and aggregated internally;

• performed limited substantive testing, on a selective basis, of the Identified Sustainability 

Information (i) to verify the assumptions, estimations and computations made in relation to 

the Identified Sustainability Information; and (ii) to check that data had been appropriately 

measured, recorded, collated and reported, to the extent we considered necessary and appropriate 

to provide sufficient evidence for our conclusion; and

• assessed the disclosure and presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information. 

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, 

and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of 

assurance in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would 

have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Accordingly, we do not 

express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the Company’s Identified Sustainability 

Information has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.

Inherent Limitations

In designing these procedures, we considered the system of internal controls in relation to the Identified 

Sustainability Information and reliance has been placed on internal controls where appropriate. Because 

of the inherent limitations in any accounting and internal control system, errors and irregularities may 

nevertheless occur and not be detected.

The absence of a commonly used generally accepted reporting framework or a significant body of 

established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure subject matter allows for different, 

but acceptable, measurement techniques that can affect comparability between entities. 

The quantification of the greenhouse gas emissions data underlying the Identified Sustainability 

Information is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to 

determine emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gases, and 

the estimation uncertainty from the measurement and calculation processes used to quantify 

emissions within the bounds of existing scientific knowledge. This can affect the ability to draw 

meaningful comparison of the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions over time. 

Conclusion

Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our 

attention that causes us to believe that the Identified Sustainability Information for the financial year ended 

31 December 2021 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.

Purpose and Restriction on Distribution and Use

This report, including our conclusion, has been prepared solely for the Company in accordance with the 

letter of engagement between us. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 

responsibility to anyone other than the Company for our work or this report.
