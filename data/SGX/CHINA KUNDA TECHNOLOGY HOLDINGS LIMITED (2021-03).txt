THE REPORT




It is our pleasure to present China Kunda’s fourth Sustainability Report for FY2021. 

As both the Board of Directors (the “Board”) and the management team continue to dedicate our efforts 

to creating long term value for our stakeholders, we are extremely mindful of the continuous changes 

in the market trends. Therefore, whilst formulating the business strategy for the Group, we ensure 

the sustainability issues will continue to be integral in our strategy formulation and we will uphold our 

commitment towards ensuring that our business practices are sustainable. China Kunda also maintains 

a clear and transparent manner of disclosing our business practices, ensuring that our stakeholders are 

not only kept abreast of emerging sustainability issues but also what we do to adapt as we expand our 

business operations. 

Despite the worldwide spread of COVID-19 which has led to uncertainty to the global economy and our 

business, we are determined to weather through this crisis and emerge stronger as an organization.  

After reviewing the past disclosures to our stakeholders, we have decided to expand our reporting this 

year on Environment and include an additional topic - Energy and Emission. Therefore, this year, the five 

material topics would now include Energy and Emission, Regulatory Compliance, Innovation and R&amp;D 

(research and development), Material Use, Training and Advancement. These ESG matters were chosen 

to ensure our resources are focused on identifying risks and opportunities across our value chain, and 

they continue to be relevant in effectively safeguarding the interests of our stakeholders this year. 

Since most of the Group’s customer base is within China and that the COVID-19 situation was quickly 

under control in the country, most of the industries have resumed production and the pandemic has 

minimal impact on the supply chain of the Group. During this time, the safety of our employees is also 

our priority and we take serious safety measures such as safe distancing and trainings for employees 

to prevent any outbreak of COVID-19 at work sites. More details can be found in the “Our COVID-19 

response” section of this report. 

Finally, we would like to express our appreciation to all our stakeholders who have been with us 

throughout our sustainability journey. We look forward to your continued support as we continue to 

create value for our stakeholders and drive our business in a responsible and sustainable manner.

STATEMENT




OVERVIEW OF CHINA KUNDA 

China Kunda is headquartered in Shenzhen, China and listed on the Singapore Exchange as a limited 

liability company. We are a provider of plastic engineering and furniture solutions to a diversified 

customer base spread across a wide geographical region ever since our incorporation in 2007.

Apart from the manufacture and sale of In-Mould-Decoration and other plastic components (the “IMD 

Business”) through its subsidiary Kunda Plastic Electronic (Shenzhen) Company Limited (“KPE”), China 

Kunda is also involved in the manufacture and distribution of furniture and other related activities 

(“Furniture Business”) through its subsidiary, Shenzhen Shi Er Ju Quan Wu Ding Zhi Company Limited 

(“SEJ”). 

Since FY2020, KPE had expanded its business into the field of medical devices by leveraging its existing 

technical expertise, and it has contributed to revenue from the sales of non-contact infrared forehead 

thermometers (“Thermometers”). 

We are committed to continuing to use our technology and expertise to explore new product lines and 

sales channels to provide scalability and sustainability for our core business. 

China Kunda has considered the impact from IMD business, furniture business and medical devices 

operation when reviewing its EESG factors in FY2021 and concluded that in FY2021, in addition to the 

same EESG topics as reported in FY2020, we will be adding a new topic Energy and Emissions. For more 

details of our materiality assessment, please refer to the section: materiality assessment.

The operation sites covered in this report are listed below in Figure 1.

Ethics and Integrity 



In China Kunda, we reaffirm the importance of promoting strong ethics and integrity to our business 

success. To maintain high standards of ethics and integrity and expect employees to show consistent 

adherence to strong moral principles and values, we integrated our ethics and integrity policies into 

China Kunda’s values and key principles as shown in Figures 2 and 3. Both of them have been reviewed 

and approved by our Core Operations and Decisions Management Committees (“Core team”) this year. In 

addition, all employees will attend training annually to acknowledge their understanding of our corporate 

values and principles.

SUPPLY CHAIN

In China Kunda, we believe that selecting reliable, high-quality and cost-efficient suppliers can help us 

achieve long-term business value. 

With the pandemic still ongoing, preventive and control measures are required by the government. With 

these measures in place, the Group, its customers and suppliers have fully resumed business. In FY2021, 

despite the pandemic, it has not caused a major disruption to our supply chain. This is because our raw 

materials are mainly being sourced from local vendors in China where the pandemic is largely under 

control. Our top 10 suppliers are mainly short production cycle manufacturers supplying materials and 

services ranging from electronic parts, sheets, mould processing.  

Please see figure 4 for the total amount spent on our top 10 suppliers in FY2021.

CHANGES TO THE ORGANISATION AND ITS SUPPLY CHAIN 

In FY2021, the Group continued to engage the supply category which is comprised of materials and accessories 

used for the production of Thermometers. With the increase in the number of companies producing such 

Thermometers, market demand is expected to slow down in the next fiscal year. Despite the expected 

slowdown in the Thermometer business, the Group remains optimistic and is exploring the market potential 

of other medical devices in light of the increase in health awareness which will contribute to the growth of the 

global medical devices industry in the long term. Currently, the Group is exploring to supply other homecare 

medical equipment.

Arsing from the above, there was a total number of 62 key suppliers1  engaged by China Kunda in FY2021, a 

16.4% increase in numbers compared to 55 suppliers in FY2020.  

 

OUR PEOPLE 

The total number of our employees fell slightly from 130 in FY2020 to 128 in FY2021 as shown in Figure 5. 

All employees under China Kunda work full-time, there is no change in the percentage of gender employees 

where it remained at 41% female and 59% male. There were 22 and 24 permanent employees in FY2020 and 

FY2021, respectively, while the rest were under fixed-term contracts. Under permanent employees in FY2021, 

there were 7 females and 17 males. In FY2021, there were no significant changes in employee numbers 

throughout the year.

1   Key suppliers refer to those who offer goods and services valued more than RMB 100,000 or equivalent to HK$114,561 per 

annum which was computed based on the average exchange rate RMB1.00:HK$1.14561 in FY2021 as compared to HK$112,224 

per annum based on the average exchange rate RMB1.00:HK$1.12224 in FY2020.

OUR COVID-19  RESPONSE

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board had provided support through reviewing the 

measures taken by the management, as well as provided guidance along the way to ensure the China 

Kunda has taken the right measures to safeguard our people and business. Regular meetings were held 

among our top management to ensure that China Kunda will always stay updated on the latest situation 

and was always in compliance with regulations imposed by the local authorities. China Kunda has also 

implemented safety management measures in accordance with the relevant requirements of the local 

government, such as regularly distributing masks and disinfectants, working from home if possible and 

controlling total personnel on-site, avoiding large gatherings, employees regularly performing COVID-19 

tests. On top of this, as of July 2021, more than 80% of our employees had received COVID-19 vaccination.

Employees 

The health and safety of our employees is our priority at China Kunda. We have been proactively taken 

measures and requirements against the spread of the pandemic from the top management since the 

start of the pandemic to safeguard the health and well-being of our employees. At the worksite and offices 

of China Kunda, we regularly distribute masks and disinfect common spaces weekly and all employees 

are required to take the temperature at the security before entering the company compound. Upon 

entering the company compound, sanitisers and disinfectants were also placed around the compound 

and all employees are required to practice safe distancing and large-scale gatherings were all cancelled.

To ensure that all of the employees are educated on such measures, the HR department has provided 

training to employees of China Kunda. Some of the training materials include what are the measures they 

should take when employees of China Kunda need to bring outsiders into the company compound, safe 

distancing measures at all times even during mealtimes and mandatory mask wearing for all production 

operations.

Supply Chain

Since most of China Kunda’s suppliers are within the country, there was no significant impact of the 

pandemic on our supply chain. This is so because the domestic pandemic was quickly brought under 

control and all the relevant industries have resumed production within a relatively short period.

Government

Although the pandemic was well controlled, the Group would still actively implement pandemic prevention 

measures in accordance with the PRC Government’s relevant pandemic regulations. On the other hand, 

our company also received certain government subsidies to help us minimize the impact of the epidemic 

on business. Since February 2020, small-scale enterprise tax is lowered from 3% to 1%. In addition, from 

February 2020 to December 2020, the Social Insurance Premiums Payable by Enterprises was temporarily 

reduced and exempted. Specifically, the work-related injury, unemployment, and endowment insurance 

were exempted, the medical insurance was halved, and during this period, the company received an 

pandemic prevention subsidy of RMB 20,000 from Longgang District Government.

Customers 

At China Kunda, we value our customers as much as they support our business. In FY2021, IMD revenue 

decreased by 17.4% as compared to FY2020, mainly attributed to the decline in sales of IMD and plastic 

injection parts to the customers in consumer electronics and electrical appliances industries who were 

adversely affected by the effects of poor market sentiment in global market largely due to Covid-19. In 

order to gain more sales orders from new customers and existing customers, the Group incentivises 

some major customers of the IMD business with IMD moulds at discounted prices or free of charge 

which will ultimately be used by Group to produce IMD products.

PROFILE




Overall, our Group adheres to sound corporate governance to safeguard shareholders’ interests and the 

Company’s assets. 

Risk Management 

China Kunda has in place an Enterprise Risk Management Framework (“ERM”), supported by the Audit 

Committee whose members are all Non-Executive Directors, that covers risk management and our 

internal control system. This ERM mobilises our ability to manage EESG risks and seize opportunities that 

help achieve our Company’s objectives.

respectively. Each management team governs the process of risk assessment under the guidance of 

external advisors and monitors the Company’s daily operations and internal control procedures. 

Concerns highlighted by both management teams are reported to the Board on a regular basis.

Sustainability Governance 

In China Kunda, our sustainability management team is responsible for overseeing sustainability policies, 

implementing sustainability initiatives and monitoring our sustainability performance. Details of the 

roles and responsibilities of our sustainability management team can be seen in Figure 8 below.

Materiality Assessment 

China Kunda first conducted a 3-steps materiality assessment in FY2018 and identified four key material 

matters that aligned with the Company’s EESG priorities. Regulatory Compliance, Innovation and R&amp;D 

Material Use, Employees Training and Advancement were chosen as critical to our business operations 

and disclosed in our inaugural sustainability report.

In FY2021, the Board and management team have reassessed these matters and decided to add a new 

material matter - “Energy and Emissions” to this year’s EESG priorities as this is a topic interested by 

external stakeholders and is important to the business operations. 

We will continue to review the materiality matters in the subsequent reporting period to ensure that the 

EESG matters remain relevant to China Kunda and are addressed in our sustainability report.

The process of China Kunda’s materiality assessment is shown in Figure 10, and the results of the 

assessment are subsequently highlighted in Figure 11.

AND APPROACH 




Regulatory Compliance 

China Kunda is committed to maintaining good corporate governance and recognises the importance 

of its internal controls put in place to ensure operational efficiency and continued compliance with 

laws, regulations and policies. We strive to apply the highest regulatory standards across our business 

operations and take all compliance issues and concerns reported seriously.

Reporting scope for this topic includes operations in both KPE and SEJ.

Policies and Practices 

In FY2021, China Kunda continued our efforts in our compliance responsibilities by:

• 

Setting up compliance cultures and sound compliance management systems to avoid risks on non-

compliance behaviours.

• 

Communicating compliance regulations/standards to all employees and including compliance rules 

in our Employee handbook. 

• 

Utilising compliance management system to guide our senior management’s actions to minimise 

non-compliance risk.

• 

Having the core team to review, monitor, and respond in real-time to any non-compliance issues

Whistle-blowing Policy 

Our Regulatory Compliance is facilitated by our Whistle-blowing policy which provides a formal grievance 

handling procedure as described in figure 12 that allows the Company to manage all our stakeholders 

to raise any issues they encounter. This Grievance Mechanism provides our employees with a safe 

environment and any other persons to raise their concerns, and we continue to encourage all our 

stakeholders to raise any issues they encounter in their relationship with the Company. Our Audit 

Committee will be responsible to review any potential conflicts of interest and if any, they will ensure 

procedures for resolving such conflicts are strictly adhered to. 

For more details of our Corporate Governance and Whistle-blowing Policy, please refer to our Corporate 

Governance Report and its section: Audit Committee and Whistle Blowing Policy in our annual report.

Targets and Performance  

In FY2021, KPE remained certified with Management System Standards ISO 9001, ISO 16949 and ISO 

140012 . Both KPE and SEJ have zero reported cases of non-compliance, demonstrating China Kunda’s 

full compliance with the laws, regulations and standards with regards to economic, environmental and 

social areas. China Kunda aims to maintain full compliance through strict adherence to our internal 

corporate governance system and hope to continue providing confidence in our regulatory compliance 

to our stakeholders. 

Figure 13: FY2021 China Kunda regulatory compliance performance 

2 As our business in SEJ is focus more on trading rather than manufacturing and the manufacturing activities of SEJ is relatively 

small, we believe these standards are not relevant to our SEJ operations as of now. However, we would like to consider 

obtaining such standards in the future when appropriate.

3 The reward per new client is only applicable in KPE and is not applicable in SEJ which commenced its manufacturing activities of 

customised cabinetry products in FY2020, and its current manufacturing activities do not involve any innovation and improvement 

in technology. 

Innovation and R&amp;D 

China Kunda is a strong advocate for continued innovation and improvements in technology to meet 

our long-term objectives of raising productivity and reducing capital costs. Furthermore, enhancing our 

capability in technology can place us in a good position to gain a competitive advantage and further our 

sustainable development goals, considering the relatively short product replacement cycles in our industry. 

Reporting scope for this topic includes operations in both KPE and SEJ.

Management Team 

The Technology Development Department is responsible for reviewing innovation policy, overseeing the 

innovation practices and evaluating the results of our innovative projects in KPE. 

Our Executive Director and the core management team oversee our business in SEJ ranging from material 

sourcing, sales, manufacturing, finance, human resources as well as innovation and R&amp;D matters. 

Currently, the main function of research and development projects were outsourced to the external 

technology company in order to avoid high capital commitment.  Our Executive Director and the core 

management team is working closely with the external technology company for the progress and results 

of research and development projects.

Policies 

In FY2021, we continued the Innovation Incentive Policy in Technology Development to reward innovative 

projects. Any project proposed is reviewed and approved by our core management team and Technical 

Director. 

With key decisive factors such as market influence, projected production level, final output and production 

location in mind, the policy has been reviewed in FY2021 and is summarised as follows (Figure 14):

Practices 

Our clients strictly evaluate and assess our new projects. We will only deliver the products to our 

customers when the products achieve certain testing requirements from clients. Our new patents will 

also be reviewed and certified by the authorised departments of the local government. Only when we 

have received the certificates from the government, will we then proceed to reward our employees for 

their contribution to the projects based on our Innovation Incentive Policy. China Kunda will proactively 

and continuously improve our R&amp;D and product quality accordingly to any feedback received from our 

clients.  









Case Study #1:KPE 3D texture printing 

The traditional IML process helps to design logo, colour, and have the pattern on the back 

of the film through screen printing, colour printing, etc. With the use of in-mould injection 

technology, it will help to attach the film to the surface of the plastic part to increase the 

aesthetics of the product.

KPE has been committed to the R&amp;D and manufacturing of IML technology since 2002. With 

the recent developments of IML technology, ID designers tend to have higher expectations 

where traditional and simple patterned or colour craftmanship can no longer satisfy their 

expectations. This is because they will be more inclined to more visually impactful, eye-

catching designs which will help to increase the selling point of their products. Therefore, 

the traditional IML appearance can hardly meet the needs of the younger generation of 

consumers. As such, our engineering and technical team has transferred 3D texture with light-

curable ink to the back of the transparent film, combined with optical coating, screen printing, 

colour printing and other processes to achieve a visual breakthrough in film materials.  

At present, the 3D texture IML process has achieved mass production and is matured 

and stable. Currently, the shipment has exceeded 1 million pieces, which has become our 

company’s market-competitive process technology.

Material Use 

In light of the rising prices of industrial raw materials in recent years, careful operational management of 

the resources that we purchase and use in our production lines will go a long way in not only cost savings 

but also reducing the amount of waste we generate. China Kunda believes that our consistent monitoring 

of the raw materials we use will improve economic efficiency and contribute to the Company’s sustainable 

development goals. 

Reporting scope for this topic includes operations in both KPE and SEJ.

Management Team 

There are two separate core management teams led by the respective general managers responsible for all 

business activities in KPE and SEJ respectively. The production managers and procurement managers within 

the core management teams are responsible for material utilization and procurement of raw materials 

respectively. 

Policy 

China Kunda has in place an incentive system to reward employees for their performance in managing the 

Company’s resources based on their ability to reduce the overall material cost ratio.

China Kunda’s annual KPI is set for each department which is linked to China Kunda’s bonus plan. Through 

the optimization of engineering accounting standards and the lower product defect rate, the material 

loss will be reduced. The reduction of material used will be reviewed at the end of the year to assess the 

distribution of department bonuses. 

Practices 

With the overarching goal of optimizing its manufacturing processes, China Kunda consistently monitors 

its usage of both renewable and non-renewable materials. We adhere to international standards in our 

production lines, and in KPE, our management system is ISO14001 and ISO9001 certified. Not only does 

this translate to cost savings in waste, recycling and consumption in the long run, but it also builds a system 

that allows the Company to better manage its environmental risks while meeting customer and regulatory 

requirements simultaneously. 

Target 

Our efforts in optimizing the efficiency of production have paid off by achieving KPE’s FY2021 target of 41% 

raw material cost ratio in FY2021 (Figure 16).

The decline in IMD sales accordingly decreased plastic sheets, paint and protective film usage from KPE, 

the total consumption of KPE’s non-renewable materials5 decrease from 539,937kg in FY2020 to 338,588kg 

in FY2021.

Total renewable material consumption in KPE, mainly cardboard in our operations, increased slightly 

from 19,374 pieces in FY2020 to 19,440 in FY2021. Our resources recycling practices achieved 26% (5,128 

pieces) of cardboard recycled in FY2021, a 10% increase from 16% (3,100 pieces) of cardboard recycled in 

FY2020. This is due to the increased percentage of existing customers in our client base who have a greater 

willingness to use recycled cardboard as packaging materials. 

Two renewable materials – multi-layer plywood and quartz were used solely in our SEJ operations in FY2021, 

which increased from 8,340 kg to 24,310 kg and 2,400 kg to 7,120 kg respectively as compared to FY2020, 

in tandem with the increased sales from customized cabinetry products.

ENVIRONMENT






As a manufacturing operator, it is extremely detrimental that China Kunda is conscious of our environmental 

footprint therefore this year, the Group decided to introduce this topic into the reporting as a material ESG 

factor to manage our energy consumption in a suitable manner. Various policies and procedures have 

been put in place to guide our efforts in enhancing our internal capabilities in order to increase the energy 

efficiency in all of the aspects of the Group’s operations. 

Management Team 

There are two separate core management teams led by the respective general managers responsible for 

all business activities in KPE and SEJ respectively. The production managers and procurement managers 

within the core management teams are responsible for material utilization and procurement of raw 

materials respectively. 

Policies 

At China Kunda, energy-saving management is an important part of the company’s operation and 

management. Therefore, we ensure that

• 

All employees have a role to participate in and perform energy-saving work.

• 

All departments will help to strengthen energy conservation publicity and actively promote new 

energy conservation technologies and facilities.

• 

Our management system is following the national energy management guidelines which will be 

integrated into our daily routines at the company’s production. 

• 

Our energy management efforts adhere to the principles of relevant national laws and policies. 

Practices

Through the years, China Kunda has identified several common findings at different sites and has set up 

a guideline for Energy Management System. This guideline provides the desired practices at offices and 

worksites of China Kunda. The relevant topics in the guideline are as follow:

Case Study #3: Managing the energy 

consumption in workspaces 

To ensure that we maintain our energy 

consumption at workplaces, we have an 

Energy Management System that has been 

put in place.  Such example of initiatives 

would be to turn off the computer display 

screen and disconnect the power supply 

after working hours, computers, printers, 

fax machines and photocopiers should 

be turned on only when needed and it 

should be set at automatic energy-saving 

consciously turn off the power of various 

electrical appliances when they get off work. 

The air conditioner at our offices are also set to a reasonable temperature and all the doors 

and windows are to be closed when the air conditioner is turned on. We will also regularly 

clean the fan coil, filter and other devices of the air-conditioning system to improve the energy 

efficiency of the air-conditioning system. In order to save energy, we will try to purchase energy-

efficient equipment as much as possible and priority should be given to purchasing energy-

saving equipment. Since this implementation, China Kunda has been purchasing energy-efficient 

equipment

By FY2021, for the SEJ business, 100% lighting fixture has changed to LED lighting. The sensor 

has also been installed at the staircase so that lights will only be switched on only when needed.

Electricity Management 

To ensure that we manage our electricity usage at offices, the Electrical Technology Department will have 

to make sure that there is a normal supply of power for the entire company, supervise and inspect the 

power consumption of each workshop and its various departments. From there, they would then put 

forward new suggestions for saving electricity and actively cooperate with the various departments on 

saving electricity. 

As for the company production, the production department has come up with reasonable scheduling for 

the equipment. For some major power-consuming equipment, the production team would try to focus 

on production, and strictly control the starting shifts so as to try to increase the load rate and reduce its 

unit power consumption. 

Fuel Management 

At China Kunda, we will ensure that there is an efficient use of vehicles. We are transparent on the fuel 

consumption of the vehicles to the public and using the statistics posted, we will reasonably determine 

the service life of vehicles, and promptly scrap and eliminate vehicles with high fuel consumption and 

environmental non-compliance. We have been conducting training on driving behaviour, providing 

regular maintenance on their vehicle that is in operation and maximizing the load for each trip. We also 

continuously monitor the management system of office vehicles and provide daily maintenance to the 

vehicles to improve the efficiency of vehicle use. To minimize unnecessary trips of the office vehicles, 

during each trip, a list of things is to be made and drivers will strive to complete the tasks within one trip. 

By doing this, we aim to maximize each trip and reduce the waste of energy and environmental pollution 

caused by the trip.

Performance

At China Kunda, we continuously improve our energy consumption at our offices and worksites. We are 

pleased to announce that through the combined efforts of all the employees at China Kunda, our overall 

energy consumption has decreased from 6.74 TJ in FY2020 to 6.47 TJ in FY2021, a 4.2% decrease. This is 

mainly due to the decrease in the use of electricity in the offices and worksites where the energy consumption 

of electricity decreased from 6.15 TJ in FY2020 to 5.72 TJ in FY2021. As for the fuel consumption, there is a 

slight increase of 0.59 TJ in FY2020 to 0.75 TJ in FY2021 in the usage of gasoline for the company vehicles as 

the number of cars increased to facilitate business expansion.

We have calculated the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Scope 1 and Scope 28 from our business 

activities as shown in Figure 23 and Figure 24. In FY2021, our scope 1 emissions have a 27.1% increase from 

41.03 tCO2 in FY2020 to 52.16 tCO2 in FY2021 and this is mainly because of the increased usage of gasoline 

for the company vehicles. Due to the decreased consumption of electricity, there was a 7.6% decrease in 

our scope 2 emissions in FY2021 where it has decreased from 1,042.38 tCO2 to 968.71 tCO2. Overall, our 

total GHG emissions decreased by 62.38 tCO2 or 5.76% from FY2020.

Training and Advancement 

China Kunda’s employees play a crucial role in the sustainable development of the Company, and we invest 

resources in providing them with the necessary training and development. For each employee, such training 

opportunities allow them to acquire new skills, sharpen existing ones, and help them further their career 

growth; for the Company, investing in our employees will increase productivity and efficiency, allowing us 

to gain a competitive advantage.

Reporting scope for this topic includes operations in both KPE and SEJ. 

Management Team 

Human Resources departments who are responsible for arranging the trainings and overseeing the 

employees’ performance reviews are set in both KPE and SEJ. 

Practices 

New hires are required to attend mandatory orientation workshops conducted by the Human Resources 

Department, which provide important information regarding production safety, mechanical operation, 

craftsmanship and product quality requirements. These orientation programs are also an avenue for 

employees to integrate into our Company culture seamlessly. This FY2021, given the current pandemic 

situation, the HR Department has conducted trainings on the safe measurements that employees should 

take at their workplace. 

China Kunda has also arranged external off-site trainings for our employees.  These training courseswill 

enable our people to upgrade their skills.

In addition to our commitment towards providing all employees with training, China Kunda also provides 

employees with tailored career planning sessions based on results from the regular employee performance 

assessments. This helps the Company better understands each employee’s career goals and enable us to 

align them with long-term Company objectives. 

Lastly, China Kunda provides subsidies to our employees who seek to further upgrade their education and 

skills. A training institution has been set up to regulate the management of training subsidies. An incentive 

system is also put in place to reward employees that have excellent performance in training sections.

Case Study #4:  

Internal development programs

China Kunda believes in providing our employees with various opportunities to grow. In FY2021, 

multiple meetings, trainings and tea sessions were arranged. For example, our strategic meeting 

in KPE reviewed our overall work performances in FY2020 which included our achievements 

and weaknesses and how we can benefit from these experiences to do better in FY2021. The 

purpose of these meetings, trainings or tea sessions is to ensure that our employees are growing 

in the same direction with the Company as well as interacting with the employees. The company 

conducts training for different positions, including,

1. New hire trainings, mainly about corporate culture and company regulations and policy

2. Marketing management, communication skills training for the salesman

3. Fire drill for all employees

4. Career planning training and management training for managerial employees

The internal development program and meetings will increase the employees’ understanding of 

the company and enhance their sense of belonging and ownership of the company, to facilitate 

future work. After the training, our employees can follow the standard to operate and strengthen 

their emergency handling capabilities, therefore, the likelihood of operation incidents can be 

reduced. We provide opportunities for self-improvement through learning new knowledge. It 

helps us to gather talents, increase productivity and performance and improve organizational 

structure.

Case Study #5: External field trips  

and learning journeys

In FY2021, we also organised several out-of-office development programmes for our 

employees to participate in, which not only included field trips and learning components but 

also provided opportunities for the unity of the employees. These activities also provided an 

avenue for employees to form connections with people outside their professional expertise 

and determine their career paths. 

In KPE, we have also arranged a trip to a well-known attraction in China, Qilangshan. We 

took this as an opportunity to let our people share their experience, exchange their views as 

well as motivating the employees. Team building can cultivate the collaboration and team 

awareness of the core team so that employees can fully realize the strength of the collective, 

enhance team cohesion. Meanwhile, this is an opportunity to relax and get close to nature, 

have work-life balance, do exercise and increase employees’ passion for work.
