For this year, each of the specific sustainability matters is explained in detail in the following sections.  

 

MATERIAL ESG FACTORS 

ENVIRONMENT 

Under the environment material matters, we focus our efforts relevant to our business operation – 

forest plantation. Key material sustainability matters relevant to forest plantation are:  

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION 

Being a forest resource company, the principles of sustainable forest management are:   

• 

protection forest reserves, wildlife reserves, virgin jungle reserves etc.  

• 

protection of riparian reserve.  

• 

not to discharge any toxic chemicals into the river which is liable to cause pollution. 

• 

no illegal logging, no hunting of wildlife, no fishing, explosives or poisons. 

We achieve the principles by complying with Sustainable Forest Management License Agreement 

(“SFMLA”). Details of our compliance efforts are outlined in the compliance SFMLA section.  

 

 

 


6 

 

COMPLIANCE SFMLA 

The Company is required to submit 10-year Plantation Development Programme as part of our Forest 

Management Plan (“FMP”). All plantation activities are conducted in strict compliance with the FMP 

and all standards pertaining to plantations in the SFMLA. 

Practices to ensure the perpetuity of forest as natural resource include: 

• 

precautionary measures to protect the forest from fire, encroachment and poaching including 

patrolling; 

• 

planting, regenerating, harvesting, silvicultural treatments of residual stand and forest protection; 

• 

observes the rules within the riparian reserve; 

• 

recognizing the limitations on the capacity of the forest to produce a sustainable flow of products 

through schedule replanting; 

• 

establish the goals and actions for managing the Commercial Class II Forest Reserves on an 

ecologically sustainable and economically substantiated basis.  

• 

emphasis shall be placed on all aspects of forest management including silvicultural treatment and 

enrichment planting, 

• 

Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is considered during the planning process to reduce the 

adverse environmental impacts. 

• 

minimizing environmental impact through reduced impact logging and extraction of logs.   

As part of our forest regeneration through replanting, the replanted areas will be curated, and site 

preparation is planned thoroughly. The site preparation includes under brushing and felling of 

remaining vegetation post salvage logging. All felled vegetation will remain on site, mechanically 

spread and crushed by excavators. Once the site cleared and crushed, the site will be treated to 

suppress weed growth prior to planting.   

To facilitate the planning and implementation of site preparation operation and planting, each site is 

compartmentalised, and each compartment is divided into smaller blocks in sizes of 10 – 40 hectares. 

This will ensure site clearing and planting can be carried out systematically and concurrently, in a 

phased approach to reduce bare-soil exposure.

During the year, we achieved the following: 

 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

The Group conducted its research and development in terms of developing most productive and 

strong seedlings for various type of trees for replanting. Our efforts include establishing germination 

house to ensure most suitable condition for the seedlings to grow and finding the best method for 

propagation techniques.  

We germinated and successfully produced a total of almost 357,000 seedlings for replant in our forest 

concession. The seedlings include type from Laran (Local), Laran Merah, Albizia Falcataria, Eucalyptus 

pelita and E. Pelita.  

•Achieved 94.5% of 

silviculture treatment for 

forest concession under 

our management, 

representing almost 659 

hectares.

SOCIAL 

WORKFORCE DIVERSITY 

We have 63 employees as at 31 July 2019.  Our Group takes an active role in succession planning and 

work towards creating a diverse workforce as regard to age, gender and ethnic diversity. One third of 

our Board members are women and 50% of our Board members consist of independent directors. 

Our employee comprising of 68% male: 32% 

female. We include women in all our 

recruitment 

processes 

and 

women 

candidates are open to all designation.  

Due to our nature of dealing with forest 

areas which are located in rural areas, our 

female employees are mostly in the area of 

administration and office-based, although 

we do have operational female staff 

handling 

seedlings 

and 

research 

&amp; 

development.  

The Group has taken appropriate steps to 

employ Malaysian Bumiputras in line with 

the country’s national policy. Among the 

steps taken include: 

• 

Training and instruction shall be both on the job and in educational or professional institutions 

in Malaysia or abroad so as to develop capabilities of local staff and to transfer the technical 

and managerial skills. 

• 

Equal right shall be accorded at all times to all employees in the same job classification 

regardless of race and religion. 

• 

Adequate insurance cover for its employees and third parties’ liability.

and conduct training to protect the health and safety of its’ employees. All accident incidences 

have to be reported to the OSH committee immediately with action plan.    

• 

Establish educational institutions in conjunction with the Education Department. 

 

Our Employee Age Profile as at 31 July 2019 

We have a young employee profile with our employees aged 50 and below representing almost 95% 

of our employees. This youthful profile is due to challenging and labour-intensive environment 

particularly working in the remote forest areas. In addition, we want our young employees to grow 

with us.

LEGAL COMPLIANCE AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

Legal compliance and corporate governance have always been one of the top priorities of the Group. 

The decision-making process of the Group is strictly in line with legal and regulatory requirements, 

and in compliance with the Code of Corporate Governance and the regulations and guidelines issued 

by the State of Sabah Government in respect of the Sustainable Forest Management License 

Agreement (SFMLA). 

ETHICS AND INTEGRITY 

We promote an ethical “act with integrity” culture throughout the Group and seek to conduct our 

business in an ethical manner and in compliance with the best practices. All directors are required to 

complete and sign an annual declaration form declaring any direct or indirect interests and any 

interested party transactions in relation to the Group.  

ANTI-CORRUPTION AND ANTI-FRAUD 

The Group is committed to zero-tolerance policy to bribery and corruption, we have put in place 

monitoring and management control systems to detect bribery, fraud or other malpractices. We have 

also established a whistle-blowing policy for employees and other stakeholders to get direct access to 

our Audit Committee Chairman. By doing so, our employees and stakeholders can be assured that all 

reports or suspicions of potential breaches of our Code of Ethics, corruption and frauds are taken 

seriously by the Board.  The whistleblowers can also be assured their identities are kept anonymous. 

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS 

The Group has put in place policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the relevant laws and 

regulations e.g. the Listing Rules of SGX-Catalist Rules, SFMLA and Personal Data Protection Act 

(“PDPA”) etc. 

 

 




12 

 

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT (“ERM”) 

We recognize the importance of risk management and how business risks may adversely affect the 

Group’s financial and operating performance. The Group has implemented an ERM system and 

performed at least half yearly risk refresher exercise to identify, assess and manage the top five risks. 

The outsourced internal auditor is engaged to independently carry out a yearly risk re-assessment and 

update risk profiles and risk registers. While it is the responsibility of the Audit Committee, as 

delegated by the Board of Directors, to oversee the effectiveness of the system of risk management 

and internal controls, the core function of the ERM framework remains with the Senior Management.
