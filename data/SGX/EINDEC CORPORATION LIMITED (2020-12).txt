BOARD STATEMENT

05

Sustainability Report 2020

The board of directors (“Board”) of Eindec is pleased to 

present the annual sustainability report for the financial year 

ended 31 December (“FY”) 2020. 

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause 

disruptions to business activities and everyone’s daily lives 

since early 2020. Lockdowns of cities were re-implemented 

and extended to curb resurgence of the virus transmission. 

The Group remains committed to doing business in a responsible 

manner, ensuring that health and safety of our stakeholders, 

particularly our employees and customers, remains as our 

utmost priority. We have adopted all the recommendations 

set out by the health ministries of the respective countries in 

which we operate, implemented split team arrangements as 

well as safe distancing in workplaces to ensure a safe working 

environment for our employees. 

During the year under review, the lockdown in China, the 

circuit breaker measures in Singapore, and the movement 

control order in Malaysia affected our operations. As China 

emerged from the pandemic, the Group was able to resume 

its operations gradually and performed better in the second 

half of the FY2020. Nevertheless, the Group continues to stay 

vigilant and compliant with the directives of the respective 

governments and authorities, ensuring the health and safety of 

our stakeholders (primarily employees, customers and business 

partners). Our employees have adopted telecommuting and 

online trainings, as well as making the necessary adjustments 

in our manufacturing facility to continue production of 

customised equipment to fulfil orders for our customers. We 

are appreciative of the concerted efforts of our employees, 

suppliers and customers to overcome the adversities during 

this challenging time.  

With the Group’s core business focusing on clean 

environmental air solutions and products – an essential indoor 

requirement for quality air management systems, we believe 

that our transformation from an equipment manufacturer to a 

customised clean environmental air solutions provider over the 

years, will drive sustainability in our business naturally as more 

businesses re-open when the pandemic is under control.   

The Board will continue to oversee the management and 

monitoring of key factors in our sustainability practices, 

improving on our disclosures as well as progressively including 

metrics and updating targets that are material to our business. 

This sustainability report is prepared with reference to the 

Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards and in compliance 

with Rules 711A and 711B of the Singapore Exchange 

Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Manual Section 

B: Rules of Catalist (the “Catalist Rules”) as well as the SGX-

ST’s Sustainability Reporting Guide. We have chosen the 

GRI framework as it is a well-known and globally-recognised 

sustainability reporting standard. 

This sustainability report highlights our key economic, 

environmental, social, and governance (“EESG”) performance 

during the 12-month period, from 1 January 2020 to 31 

December 2020, focusing on the Group’s manufacturing 

facility in Malaysia, and operations in Singapore. Performance 

data from our China operations, primarily the air purification 

system solutions segment (“AP”) has not been included as 

part of the report as the operations are usually on project basis. 

Our initiatives during FY2020 in broadening our solutions 

and services in the AP segment to encompass ‘smart home’ 

or home automation solutions and services will take time to 

stabilise. Notwithstanding that, we intend to expand the scope 

of our sustainability performance of the operations in China in 

the future, when more activities take place. 

No external assurance was sought for this report. This 

sustainability report is done in good faith and to the best of 

our knowledge. 

This sustainability report will not be printed as part of Eindec’s 

commitment to environmental conservation. The report is 

available on Eindec’s corporate website www.eindec.com.sg 

and under the Company’s corporate announcements on www.

sgx.com.

We welcome feedback from our stakeholders with regards 

to our sustainability practices and reporting, which could 

potentially assist us to further improve our policies and 

systems. You may reach out to us at enquiry@eindec.com.sg.

Sustainability Report 2020

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

The Board approves the Group’s general policies and strategies including those relating to sustainability. 

The management team reports to the Board and is responsible for reviewing the Group’s sustainability 

performance, material topics, stakeholder concerns, the setting of targets for material topics, and 

establishing systems to collect, verify, and monitor information required for the sustainability reports.

The adoption of the matrix-based approach, which is based on the likelihood and impact of occurrences to 

address the Group’s sustainability risk profile and priority issues, allows the Group to continue to use this 

method to monitor our risk profile on a regular basis. 

We reviewed our material topics in FY2020 based on internal stakeholders’ discussion. The material topics 

reviewed continue to have an economic, environment and social influence on our business activities. 

As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Group’s business activities in the manufacturing of air 

environmental equipment in Malaysia as well as the marketing and operations in Singapore slowed down. 

Nevertheless, we endeavour to increase our interactions with the various stakeholder groups related to the 

material topics identified for our subsequent sustainability reports as we look forward to normalcy in our 

business operations.

Economic Performance

We continue to give our best efforts, driving possible improvements to be the partner of choice for customised clean 

environmental air solutions and services in residential, commercial and industrial property developments.

The Group’s operations in China were the main contributor to the set of satisfactory 

results in FY2020 as the rest of the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 

pandemic. The Group had ceased its operations in Singapore and Malaysia during 

the lockdowns of cities due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In FY2020, the Group registered 81.3% year-on-year increase in revenue to S$20.40 

million, up from S$11.25 million for the financial year ended 31 December 2019 

(“FY2019”). The increase was mainly attributed to contributions from cleanroom 

equipment (“CRE”) and air purification system solutions (“AP”) segments. In 

FY2020, the AP segment registered commendable growth with the completion of 

projects and the increase in demand for air purification systems, as well as maiden 

contribution from the enhanced services through the Group’s Chinese subsidiaries, 

Henan Yunzhi Security Technology Co., Ltd and Henan Eindec Construction &amp; 

Technology Co., Ltd. The CRE segment had also recorded higher revenue from 

demand for cleanroom equipment in semiconductor factories located in Malaysia. 

These higher contributions were partially offset by the Group’s heating, ventilation 

and air-conditioning segment registered a negative growth in FY2020 on the back of 

suspension of work at construction sites in Singapore.

 

Please refer to the following sections of our annual report for FY2020, which can

Performance in FY2020

� Delays in fulfilment of secured 

contracts due to suspension of 

work for property development 

projects in Singapore, had an 

adverse impact on the Group’s 

revenue and earnings.

� Narrowed net loss attributable 

to shareholders by 63.1% to 

S$0.61 million on the back of 

improved operational efficiency 

and strong contribution from 

China operations and Malaysia.

� Reduced operating expenses 

by 11.1% from S$5.18 

million in FY2019 to S$4.60 

million in FY2020 with lower 

administrative expenses as well 

as research and development 

expenses for industrial dampers 

and air purifier products.

Targets for FY2021

� The uncertainties arising from 

the COVID-19 pandemic 

continue to affect the operations 

and financial performance of 

the Group, particularly the 

operations in Malaysia and 

Singapore.

� The Group will strive to improve 

financial performance through

 

cost management and look 

forward to fulfil the secured 

contracts when construction 

and property development 

activities resume.

� Continue to explore 

opportunities within the Group’s 

existing range

 

of products to drive growth.

Anti-competitive Behaviour 

 

The Group is committed in ensuring businesses are conducted in an ethical and 

fair manner. We actively seek to enhance and expand our clean air environmental 

solutions and services to satisfy the requirements of our customers.

The Group has implemented a Fraud and Whistle-blowing Policy whereby a 

designated mailing address and email address are provided for all employees to 

raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other 

matters, which they become aware and to ensure that:

1. 

independent investigations are carried out in an appropriate and timely manner; 

2. 

appropriate action is taken to correct the weakness in internal controls and 

policies which allowed the perpetration of fraud and/ or misconduct and to 

prevent a recurrence; and 

3. 

administrative, disciplinary, civil, and/or criminal actions that are initiated 

following the completion of investigations are appropriate, balanced, and fair 

while providing reassurance that employees will be protected from reprisals or 

victimisation for whistle-blowing in good faith and without malice.

EINDEC CORPORATION LIMITED

Enterprise Risk Management

The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management 

framework.

The Group had engaged third party professional to establish the Group’s Risk Control Assurance 

Framework. Risk management policies have been established to identify and analyse the key risks faced 

by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, develop a risk control matrix, and to implement 

procedures to monitor and report risks and adherence to limits.

Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and 

the Group’s activities. The Group, through training and management standards and procedures, aims to 

develop a disciplined and constructive control environment whereby all employees understand their roles 

and obligations.

The Audit Committee of the Company oversees how the management monitors compliance with the 

Group’s risk management policies and procedures, and from time to time, reviews the adequacy of the 

risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Audit Committee is assisted in 

its oversight role by the internal auditor. The internal auditor undertakes both regular and ad-hoc reviews 

of the Group’s risk management controls and procedures and reports its findings to the Audit Committee.

We will continue our practice of performing risk assessment at least once per year, either internally or with 

the assistance of a third party professional as determined by the Audit Committee.
