BOARD 

STATEMENT 

 

Dear Stakeholders, 

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Dutech Holdings Limited (“Dutech” or the “Group”), I am 

pleased to present our inaugural Sustainability Report 2017. As a manufacturer, we are aware that 

our operations are consuming the social resources and have some impacts on the environment 

and community.  

 

SUSTAINABLE INITIATIVES 

 

We strive to have a positive impact on the environment and society as a whole, while remaining a 

successful business and increasing shareholder‟s value. We take sustainability as the fundamental 

to the long-term development and introduce the concept of “Sustainable” in our objectives related 

to all the processes, plants and systems in our operation business. In 2017, Dutech stepped 

forward for firstly presenting in details our sustainability strategies, initiatives and performance 

related to environmental, social and governance to our stakeholders. We set up our approach to 

the sustainability with four material pillars, including Environment, People, Economics and 

Community to ensure the implementation of the sustainability strategy.  

 

COMMITMENT&amp; ASSURANCE 

 

This is Dutech‟s first sustainability report. When preparing the report, the Board delegated the 

authority for daily management of economic performance, people and environmental topics to the 

Sustainability Working Group in Shanghai headquarters to oversee the sustainability process 

within the Group and ensure the proper and consistent direction of the Group‟s strategy. Our 

Sustainability Working Group worked hard on the determination and assessment of material 

environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors, after gathering all the information from 

different functions. All the processes are monitored by the board.  

 

The board took the responsibility to review the report, as a result, we can ensure herein:  

The following sustainability report is prepared with the internationally recognized Global Reporting 

Initiative (“GRI”) Standards and is complied with the SGX-ST Listing Rules 711A and 711B.

ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT 

 

We will inevitably create noise, produce waste water and emit polluted air with dust in the 

production process. Environmental protection is extremely important to us. We continuously seek 

to provide quality products that minimally influence the environment, while reduce our 

environmental footprint in the production. To minimize the environmental footprint,  

1. 

We have put in place a specific guideline for every step in the production process to ensure 

adherence to the requirements of the ISO14001 environmental management system 

certification. 

2. 

We designated a full-time environmental specialist to be responsible for the environmental 

management on the plants. Based on the review from our environmental specialist, we are 

continuously trying to make improvement on our environmental management system.  

3. 

Periodic testing and audits are conducted by the environmental specialist to identify any 

deficiency in our environmental management system. 

 

POLLUTED AIR&amp;NOISE 

 

Each workshop at our plants is equipped with dust removal systems. Noise is isolated by moving 

source away from the circumjacent residential and business areas, thickening shock pads and 

building sound-proof premises. From 2015, we passed all the tests for air and noise emission.  

 

WASTE WATER,  

Based on our local regulation before FY2015, all 

the hazardous water should be collected together, 

stored for centralized treatment by the qualified 

plant. We outsourced the waste water disposal to 

the qualified plant before discharging, we also 

have put in place specific procedure for workers to 

collect and store waste water.  

 

Since FY2016, to meet our local environmental regulation, we started to build a sewage treatment 

station at main plant. The new sewage treatment station is designed with 17 processes to dispose 

the wastewater, ensuring 100% meet the emission standards. The situations of sewage discharge 

and air emission are detailed in the table above

ENERGY CONSUMPTION 

 

We consume a large amount of water, electricity and nature gas in various forms in daily 

production, while at the same time, will leave some adverse impacts on environment.  

 

In FY2017, Electricity Consumption per 10,000 RMB Output was decreased from 54.03KG to 

41.53KG in FY2016, largely because of the reconstruction scheme of air compressors conducted 

in June FY2016, which was also well managed in FY 2017 with a slight decrease of 0.47KG. It 

successfully saved 23% electricity compared with FY2015, 1% compared with FY2016. Water

RESTRICTION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES (ROHS) REQUIREMENT  

Since the new ROHS Directive 2011/65/EU have been published in the Official Journal of the 

European Union on 1st July, 2011, we took the rapid response. We worked closely with our 

suppliers to collect materials information to assure the quality of supply.

undertake to ensure that their supply complies 

with 

the

Substances (RoHS), and clearly explicit this 

warranty clause in the renewed supply 

contract.  

 

Besides, in order to retain the reliable and 

qualified 

suppliers, 

we 

make 

regular 

performance evaluation of our suppliers with 

respect of quality, availability and On-Time 

test.  

 

According to the performance evaluation, the number of the qualified suppliers in 2017 increased 

to 1,369, among which 77.3% achieved a long-term cooperation with us.  

 

Internally, we also strictly controlled production process by properly managing chemical 

substances, reducing hazardous substances in our products, regularly inspecting of finished 

products. Up to now, all the inspections showed that our products are qualified under the new 

RoHS.
