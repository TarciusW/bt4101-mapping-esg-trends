ESG IN THE CONTEXT OF BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS | SOCIAL IMPACTS | GOVERNANCE | TARGETS &amp; POLICIES | APPENDIX

Headquartered and listed in Singapore, Procurri Corporation Limited is a leading 

global independent provider of IT lifecycle services and data centre equipment. It offers 

Lifecycle Services, which includes Hardware-as-a-Service, Independent Maintenance 

Services and IT Asset Disposition, alongside IT Distribution, which includes Hardware 

Resale and Supply Chain Management. Procurri employs more than 400 employees 

across its 14 offices worldwide, with an extensive operations and services coverage 

spanning over 100 countries. 

Procurri works to keep its environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance 

positive by being a responsible, diverse and equal opportunities employer, extending 

product life where possible to reduce society’s carbon and waste footprint.

ESG IN THE CONTEXT OF BUSINESS

Technology is rapidly evolving and changing our lives in ways that were unimaginable just a mere 

decade ago. All modern economies rely on technology and information services to develop and 

grow. The combined use of software and hardware systems helps in the development of economically 

important products by increasing efficiencies and providing new services. With the sudden overhaul 

of existing systems or technologies that is taking place due to innovation in Information Technology and 

Communications, new challenges for sustainability are becoming material. New technology brings with 

it new social and environmental externalities that need to be addressed in order to protect stakeholders. 

Being proactive in material sustainability issues provides companies with the opportunity to increase 

their value, both in business and financial terms. Focusing on these key materiality issues will allow 

companies to positively impact their growth both in terms of profit and customers, while failure to address 

externalities can cause harm to the company’s reputation and profits. 

Understanding the environmental and social impacts from software and IT firms will allow Procurri to 

capitalise on the services it provides. Our sector has tremendous potential to not just fuel growth but to 

also help economies progress in a sustainable manner. 

Globally, IT and software firms can have significant 

environmental and social impacts. By understanding these 

potential issues, Procurri can capitalise on the services it provides.

BOARD STATEMENT

As a leading global player in the enterprise IT services and hardware industry, Procurri is aware of the 

importance of good corporate citizenship. 

The ethos of our business is deeply entrenched in the three Ps of the Triple Bottom Line – People, Planet 

and Profit – coined by John Elkington, a world authority on corporate responsibility and sustainable 

development. Our Hardware Resale encourages the use of pre-owned or refurbished equipment and 

our Independent Maintenance Services enable companies to prolong the lifespan of their enterprise 

hardware, while our IT Asset Disposition empowers companies to dispose e-waste responsibly. 

In compliance with the Singapore Exchange’s sustainability reporting framework, we are excited to be 

publishing our inaugural Sustainability Report 2017. This complements our ongoing green effort with the 

electronic dissemination of our Annual Report 2017 and accompanying Appendix to shareholders via 

our corporate website. This report evidences the ESG key performance indicators (KPIs) that are material 

to the practices of Procurri, identified using established materiality assessment of the Sustainability 

Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and refined for purpose by Trucost, part of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices 

and world-leading independent ESG analysts. 

Procurri recognises the importance of good governance for continued growth and investors’ confidence. 

Furthermore, it has set targets for the short, medium and long term to strive to improve its performance. 

Analysis has identified the most significant cause of GHG emissions in Procurri operations is associated 

with electricity consumption. In contrast to many companies in the IT sector, embedded energy of 

equipment is not the most significant impact, as Procurri sources equipment from pre-used sources, 

resulting in a net benefit carbon footprint for the products. 

The Board recognises and values the importance of the ESG performance of Procurri and ultimately 

oversees all ESG factors and policies.

The ethos of our business is deeply entrenched in the 

three Ps of the Triple Bottom Line – People, Planet and 

Profit. Our businesses encourage the reuse and recycle of 

enterprise hardware equipment, resulting in a net benefit 

carbon footprint for the products.

MATERIAL ESG FACTORS &amp; REPORTING FRAMEWORK 

Identifying the impacts that are material to investors and other stakeholders is crucial for IT companies in 

order to streamline available resources. At present, many companies do not have an active approach 

to ESG issues. While ESG issues may be on their agenda, they are not prioritised as significantly as 

they should be.

Procurri recognises the importance of identifying issues important to the financial operation of its business, 

as well as stakeholders, such as investors, society and customers. This report focuses on the four regional 

head offices of Procurri in Singapore; Atlanta, the United States of America ("USA"); and Cirencester 

and Warrington in the United Kingdom ("UK"). These are the most important sites and cover 61% of the 

total employees of Procurri's global operations. The remaining 39% are widely spread across numerous 

geographical bases. The one exception to be included in future years of reporting is Rockland Congruity 

LLC, a 51%-owned company set up in January 2017 with its office in Boston.

When considering materiality, Procurri conducted a two-phase assessment. It initially considered all 

sector-level materiality to identify all issues relevant to companies operating in the sector. These themes 

were identified using the SASB Hardware, Software and IT standards, investor trend review and a wider 

literature review. 

Sector-level materiality was identified and refined based on specific practices of the company. Many of 

these issues are not applicable to Procurri due to its specific operations. To give an example, one of the 

most significant causes of environmental impact in the sector is the production of the hardware itself – 

including sourcing of raw materials, such as rare metals. However, as Procurri sources its equipment from 

recovered units, and is essentially replacing the need for additional original equipment manufacturing, 

few virgin raw materials are required. As such, the environmental footprint of equipment is not relevant 

to Procurri. 

Exhibit 1 highlights the material ESG issues identified for Procurri. Sector material issues that are not 

relevant to Procurri, but were considered, are represented with dark grey shading, while issues that are 

immaterial for the sector and operations are coloured light grey.

Procurri does come into contact with data through the disposal of assets, and this is therefore reported 

as relevant within the Governance section of the report. However, Procurri does not collect personal 

customer data, such as home telephone numbers or home addresses, as part of its business operations 

or for use in its business operations.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS 

OPERATIONAL FOOTPRINT 

Procurri considers environmental responsibility to be crucial to the successful operation of its business and 

operates both its UK and Singapore sites to the environmental management system standard ISO 14001, 

and quality management standard ISO 9001. It has set a target to achieve these standards across US 

operations within the next five years. 

Procurri’s operational environmental footprint was calculated by independent ESG experts Trucost, part 

of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Analysis is based on onsite energy use, water use, vehicle fuel and business 

travel. 

For the purposes of this report, Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions to air are reported in line with the 

Greenhouse Gas Protocol, an international corporate accounting and reporting framework developed 

by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. The 

Greenhouse Gas Protocol differentiates between direct and indirect emissions using a classification 

system across 3 different scopes: 

Procurri extends the life of equipment wherever possible and in 

2017, conducted almost 1,780 service and maintenance jobs. 

Over 388,000 items were made available for reuse in 2017.

SCOPE 1

includes direct emissions 

from sources which 

a company owns or 

controls. This includes 

direct emissions from fuel 

combustion and industrial 

processes.

SCOPE 2

covers indirect emissions 

relating solely to the 

generation of purchased 

electricity that is consumed 

by the owned or controlled 

equipment or operations of 

the company.

SCOPE 3

covers other indirect 

emissions including  

third-party provided  

business travel.

EXHIBIT 4: GHG EMISSIONS BY SCOPE

EXHIBIT 5: WATER CONSUMPTION BY SOURCE

The majority (58%) of the captured GHG emissions were associated with purchased electricity across 

the sites, though it should be noted that business travel is the only Scope 3 category included in this 

assessment. If wider Scope 3 categories such as purchased goods and services, and use of products, 

were included, emissions are likely to increase significantly.

Procurri used only supplied water across all of its sites globally, and the majority of use was associated 

with domestic requirements, such as toilets and hand basins. As such, water use was relatively low.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

REUSE &amp; RECYCLING OF IT EQUIPMENT

EXHIBIT 6: WASTE HIERARCHY AT PROCURRI

In addition to Procurri’s own operational footprint, consideration of the environmental impact of company 

activities was given. Refurbishment and reuse of equipment prolong its useful life with minimal additional 

environmental cost and are the preferred approach for a sustainable solution. Procurri extends the life of 

equipment wherever possible and in 2017, conducted almost 1,780 service and maintenance jobs. 

Over the financial year 2017, over 388,000 items were made available for reuse. This included a 

wide range of equipment and component pieces.

Though details of each individual piece are not recorded, a newly manufactured single laptop or 

desktop computer would typically emit approximately 160 and 210 tonnes of carbon dioxide (tCO2e), 

respectively, before being used (EcoInvent, 2016)1. Although data was not collected for all sites, based 

on UK activity alone, if only 5% of equipment recovered was a laptop or computer, GHG emissions 

avoided would be greater than those associated with onsite fuel use and electricity use at all four offices. 

When products reach a stage where this is no longer economically viable, Procurri provides a service 

that ensures environmentally sound recycling into raw materials for reuse, both diverting material from 

landfill and preventing detrimental impact through landfill management, and preserving resources by 

avoiding virgin material extraction for new products.

Procurri aims to create an environment that encourages and values diversity within its workforce and 

builds on the differences individuals bring. It aims to draw upon the widest possible range of views and 

experiences in order to meet the changing needs of employees, clients and partners. 

EMPLOYEE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

Procurri believes diversity and inclusion: 

• Are imperative to its business;

• Drive its business results, enhance its reputation, and help attract, recruit, engage and retain a 

diversified team of business talent; 

• Mean recognising that individuals differ in all ways – nationality, religion, race, culture, gender, 

education, experience, belief and ideas. These are what make all of us unique individuals; and

• Enable it to leverage and value employees’ differences, believing that this will lead to greater 

innovation and creativity, leading to superior business results. 

As such, business activities, such as hiring, training, compensation, career progressions opportunities, 

terminations and recreational events, are conducted without discrimination, based on merits and 

unhampered by artificial barriers, prejudices or preferences. 

Employee development is important and Procurri recognises that regular performance reviews and 

training help keep staff motivated and the company successful.

SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT

Procurri participates in a range of community engagement and charitable activities. Activities in 2017 

included a "Build a Bike" Challenge teambuilding activity, where Procurri Singapore employees had to 

build a bicycle from scratch by assembling bicycle parts within two hours. The completed bicycles were 

then donated to Hougang Sheng Hong Family Service Centre, a neighbourhood welfare services centre.

In the UK, Procurri sponsored employee attendance at an event for the Jumbulance Trust, a charity that 

makes travel possible for adults and children with disabilities or chronic illnesses. 

The US office participated in the Smart Kid Program. This is run by Action Ministries and the Smart Lunch 

to bring free and nutritious meals to children in need. The US team participated through cash donations, 

as well as assisting with buying the ingredients, assembling the lunches and delivering them to over 60 

children in the local community weekly.

Procurri operates with company policies of Equal Opportunities, Code of Conduct, Employee Diversity 

and Inclusion, Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption, Grievance Process and Disciplinary Policy, all reflecting 

a commitment to respect workers in both its own business and its supply chain worldwide. The following 

section considers some of the key governance structures in place. 

BOARD DIVERSITY

The Board currently comprises five directors, three of whom are independent non-executive directors. As 

independent non-executive directors make up half of the Board, the Board is able to exercise objective 

judgment independently from management and no individual or small group of individuals dominate 

the decisions of the Board. Currently, the Board consists of five males, with combined expertise across 

a range of specialties, including finance, accounting, legal, business and industry knowledge. Procurri 

provides detail of its Corporate Governance in an annual report which can be found here. 

DATA AND SECURITY

Procurri does not collect personal client data as part of its business operations or for use in its business 

operations. Procurri comes into contact with client data as part of its IT Asset Disposition offering, when 

clients entrust their end-of-life IT equipment to Procurri for testing and verification, data erasure and/or 

disposal. Procurri handles these electronic equipment with utmost security and ensures data security is 

maintained at all times. Telephone numbers, customer identification numbers, address details and other 

personal information is destroyed as part of the IT Asset Disposition process and not stored for ongoing use. 

Each region operates to local requirements and best practices, though key processes are the same. Asset 

testing and verification premises are in a caged and secure location and only accessible by authorised 

personnel. All storage equipment that is erased has certificates generated citing the type of erasure 

standard requested. For data erasure, Singapore operations use Blancco certification, an ISO 27001-–

compliant third party data erasure provider. The UK uses the ADISA ICT Asset Recovery Standard, for 

which it is externally audited. 

For asset disposal, the three regions use third-party vendors detailed below:

• Singapore: National Environment Agency-approved vendor. 

• USA: R2-certified recycler audited annually. 

• UK: UK Environment Agency licensed and authorised recycler. 

Specifically, and for the purposes of transparency, data security details are given below.

TARGETS &amp; POLICIES

Procurri is excited to be releasing its inaugural Sustainability Report for the financial year 2017. As a 

business focused on providing sustainable solutions to the global waste challenge, Procurri has relatively 

low ESG impact for onsite operations, but continues to target optimisation to further reduce negative 

impacts and promote positive impacts. 

Procurri considers responsible management of ESG issues to be critical to successful business practice. 

It strives to continuously improve its ESG performance and, as such, has set a series of public targets to 

achieve in the short, medium and long term. 

• Formalise an Investor Relations policy by 2018.

• Expand social data coverage to include employee training hours for all four regional headquarters 

by 2020.

• Expand ISO 14001 &amp; 9001 certification to the US office, in line with its Singapore and UK regional 

headquarters, by 2022.

CALCULATING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

Different GHGs have different Global Warming Potentials (GWP)3 or abilities to contribute to rising 

temperatures. Data is standardised by converting the different greenhouse gases into their carbon 

dioxide equivalent according to the GWP index published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 

Change (IPCC)4. The index identifies the radiative effects of different GHGs in the atmosphere relative 

to an equal mass of CO2 over a 100-year timeframe. GWP enables all the GHGs to be expressed in 

terms of CO2 equivalents, or CO2e. Quantities of GHG emissions are derived from data on operational 

and vehicle fuel consumption, electricity use and business travel. 

3 Global Warming Potential (GWP) is the ratio of the warming of the atmosphere caused by one substance to that caused by a 

similar mass of carbon dioxide, which is assigned a reference value of 1.

4 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the World Meteorological 

Organisation (WMO) and by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) with a mandate to provide an objective source 

of information about climate change.
