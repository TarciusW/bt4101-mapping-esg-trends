ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES

ENERGY, WATER CONSUMPTION AND WASTE MANAGEMENT

The Group is strongly committed to eco-friendly practices. We implement and encourage energy saving, 

water conserving and waste reduction measures in the workplace. Some of these initiatives include:

- 

Perform regular maintenance of machinery and equipment to improve productivity, prolong their 

useful life spans and minimise energy consumption

- 

All employees are reminded to switch off lighting, air conditioner and any electrical appliance when 

not in use

- 

Perform regular maintenance of water fittings to reduce risk of leakage

- 

Encourage employees to report to Admin Department in the event of any water leakage 

- 

Awareness and education initiatives to encourage energy and water conservation and 3Rs – reduce, 

reuse and recycle

- 

Reduce paper usage through double-sided printing 

- 

Reuse paper with single side printing

- 

Implement paperless initiatives e.g. e-invoice and e-statement to customers

- 

Paper that cannot be reused are sent to recycling plants

- 

Recycle used toner cartridges

ENERGY AND WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS

As part of our commitment to protecting the environment, we bring in products that are energy efficient. 

While we ensure that refrigerators and laundry dryers meet the minimum requirements of NEA before 

they are allowed for sale in Singapore, we are conscientiously working with suppliers to increase the 

range of more energy efficient products such as refrigerators and laundry dryers for distribution at 

competitive prices. Conscious efforts are made by our sales team on promoting highly energy efficient 

products such as heat pump dryers which are labelled with the most “ticks” in energy saving grading by 

NEA. 

As for products which are listed to be water efficient by PUB before they can be brought in to Singapore 

for sales, we ensure that these products, namely faucets and washing machines, comply with at least the 

minimum requirements. In addition to that, we endeavour to bring more products which are of higher 

grading in terms of water efficiency.
