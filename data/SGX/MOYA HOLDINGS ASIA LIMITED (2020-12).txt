DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

On behalf of the board of directors (“Board”) of Moya Holdings Asia Limited (the “Company” or “Moya”), and 

together with its subsidiaries, (the “Group”), we are pleased to present you with the Company’s Sustainability 

Report (“Report”) for the financial year ended 31 December (“FY”) 2020.

COVID-19: AN UNPRECEDENTED SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGE

Since the first reported COVID-19 outbreak at the end of 2019, the world and Indonesia continued to grapple 

with a monumental challenge in 2020. As of 10 May 2021, approximately 1.71 million people have been infected 

with COVID-19 in Indonesia. While 1.47 million people have recovered, 46,842 deaths were recorded.1 The World 

Bank has estimated that Indonesia’s GDP contracted by a substantial 2.2% in 2020. In response, the Indonesian 

government disbursed a total of IDR 579.8 trillion in 2020, representing about 3.8 percent of GDP, as part of an 

ongoing national economic recovery program.2 This pandemic is an unprecedented sustainability challenge 

in every sense.

With the virus mutating into new strains, the world continues to be confronted with a most formidable and 

mortal enemy.3 In the face of this, we are very heartened to see that the world’s best scientists, institutions 

and governments have galvanised themselves to create COVID-19 vaccines in record time. The Indonesian 

government is targeting COVID-19 vaccinations for 181.5 million people, about two-thirds of the population. As 

of 17 May 2021, approximately 9 million people have been fully vaccinated.4 Daily infection rates have started 

to fall from a peak of 14,000 a day to less than 6,000 a day.5 This is a tremendous effort by the Indonesian 

government, which will underpin the country’s steady recovery from the pandemic. We have pledged our full 

support to the Indonesian government in fighting and overcoming this pandemic.

CLIMATE RED ALERT

Amidst the pandemic, the world and Indonesia continue to face many environmental challenges. The World 

Meteorological Report 2020 noted several worrisome climate records in the year, such as increased greenhouse 

gases concentrations, third warmest year in history, and extreme weather conditions.6 Jakarta was affected by 

severe floods at the start of 2020, which also disrupted electricity supply to the city.7

As the climate crisis will slowly but surely impact our water business, the Group is doing its small part by 

committing to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprint with each passing year.

STEADFAST BY OUR PEOPLE

All these public health, climate and economic crises are individually extremely challenging – when they 

converge, humanity may be faced with an existential threat. We must pool all our best minds, communities, 

institutions and governments to vanquish these threats to our people and planet.  In this regard, the Group’s 

business philosophy is, more than ever, a compass for sustainability – everything that matters, is about people. 

Our management re-assessed the Group’s ESG materiality factors for 2020, such that the people-centric issues 

received our priority attention. As a result, Occupation Health and Safety (GRI 403), Local Community (GRI 

413), Socioeconomic Compliance (GRI 419), and Employment (GRI 401) were factors which were elevated in 

our materiality assessment. Our major concerns centred around the safety of our staff as well as the security 

of their employment with the Group.

Our community commitments were not disrupted and were in fact increased. The total number of our 

community service engagements went from 78 to 103 in 2020. We installed public wash basins in multiple public 

locations such as bus-stops to enable the public to commute in a cleaner environment. We also contributed 

water facilities to public kitchens which served emergency hospitals that were built during the height of the 

COVID-19 outbreak. One of our larger community projects includes the river widening projects by PT Aetra Air 

Jakarta (“AAJ”) to help reduce flooding in the Buaran area. In 2020, we also sponsored our first scholarship 

awards to children of Moya’s employees seeking further education in areas that would aid our operations in 

the future.

SUSTAINABLE SAFE OPERATIONS

More than a year from the onset of COVID-19, extensive and strict safety protocols have become the norm in our 

Group. Safe-distancing, remote-working, temperature-screening, contact-tracing, routine work-place sanitising, 

and the use of face masks have all become basic workplace practices. With only 25% of our workforce on 

rotational onsite shift, we have effectively controlled the risk of COVID-19 infections in our operations. In addition, 

we augmented our human resource policy so that we can provide basic healthcare to our employees such 

as free health kits, vitamins and meals. We also ensured that there is practical health education and timely 

information flow across our organisation.

In the densely populated city of Jakarta in which we operate, and like the experience of many large 

organisations, we could not completely protect our staff from COVID-19 infections. However, with strict preventive 

and reactive safety procedures and resources firmly in place, we were able to keep our overall staff exposure 

to COVID-19 infection to under 10% of our total workforce.

STAKEHOLDERS IMPACTS

Our customers and suppliers were not spared by COVID-19. Our commercial and industrial customers 

experienced a sharp decline in their business, which had a knock-on effect on their level of water consumption. 

In these circumstances, management worked closely with customers to resolve their difficulties such as cashflow 

management.

A substantial portion of our overseas suppliers faced shipping delays during the year. Supply chains are 

gradually returning to normal. These disruptions necessitated that the Group seek alternative supply sources, 

which will help to improve our business continuity.

FORGING AHEAD IN OUR CAPACITY

Despite the pandemic, it is critical that the Group forges ahead in providing clean water across Jakarta, so 

that we can steadily help communities reduce the usage of groundwater – an age-old practice in Indonesia 

which has caused significant environmental damage. Importantly, clean water contributes to general hygiene 

and health in the communities and can help reduce the risk of widespread diseases.

In 2020, the Group significantly expanded its operations through the acquisition of Obor Infrastructure Pte. Ltd 

and its subsidiaries, bringing approximately 4,600 litres per second (“lps”) to serve over 2 million population 

in part of Western Jakarta and Tangerang area. The Group’s subsidiary, PT Tirta Kencana Cahaya Mandiri 

(“TKCM”), which supplies clean water to the Tangerang Regency area, also saw its capacity increase from 

1,300 lps to 1,600 lps.

We are also gratified that the Group’s IDR 417 Billion West Semarang Water Supply project, under 

PT Air Semarang Barat (“ASB”), received a “Highly Commended” recognition at the Global Water Awards 

2020 ceremony. ASB commenced commercial operations on 22 May 2021.

A key lesson from the pandemic is the importance of technology. We are committed to continually invest in 

sustainable technologies, especially in our water treatment operations. In February 2020, we further completed 

two new cutting-edge sludge treatment units.

PLEDGE AND APPRECIATION

It is vital that the Group stays steadfast and vigilant through this unprecedented sustainability crisis. This can 

only be accomplished with the strength and cohesion of our team and our families, and the support of all our 

external stakeholders. We would also like to record our appreciation, respect and support to healthcare workers, 

who have, and continue to make immense sacrifices for the nation. We would like to express our heartfelt 

appreciation to our management, staff and partners who have contributed directly and indirectly to this report.

Last but not least, we wish to express our deepest condolences to those who have lost their loved ones to 

COVID-19. We must strive forward and overcome this pandemic together, so that their loss will not be in vain.

positive ESG impacts and (ii) to minimise detrimental impacts.

II. 

OPERATIONS

• 

Identify our key stakeholders and consider how we can collaborate to advance our sustainability 

strategy.

• 

Actively engage with our key stakeholders in the material ESG topics across multiple communication 

platforms.

• 

Continual development and improvement of current polices and reporting procedures.

• 

Review latest data gathering methods in accordance with management criteria, and in compliance 

with international standards to inform management decisions.

THE GRI STANDARDS

To maintain continuity with previous years’ reports, the FY2020 sustainability report is prepared with reference 

to the GRI standards. This report builds upon last year’s performances to provide context to our efforts towards 

our long-term sustainability goals.

We have chosen to report using the GRI standards as it is internationally renowned and is a widely accepted 

reporting framework among the world’s largest corporations. More importantly, the GRI standards are continually 

reviewed and refreshed to maintain relevancy to the ever-changing issues surrounding sustainability, The GRI 

standards framework maintain an expansive scope of reporting surrounding major economic, social, and 

environmental issues.

Material ESG topics identified are assessed and presented with data, where available. Reference to specific 

GRI standard and disclosures are mentioned throughout the report.

Moya has identified six key stakeholders which are Investors, Customers, Employees, Communities, Suppliers, 

Government and Regulators. As with previous years, we have maintained close relations with all our key 

stakeholder groups through active engagements such as conferences, focus group discussions, interviews, 

and surveys. This allows Moya to accomplish an ongoing conversation with the stakeholders, enabling Moya 

to identify, plan and minimise sustainability-related risks. In 2020, COVID-19 clearly dominated the concerns 

of all stakeholders and the Group endeavoured to support all stakeholder groups in navigating through the 

pandemic.

Evaluation of areas of interests are reflected in the table below.

The material ESG factors have been identified by the Sustainability Task Force through the major issues 

highlighted by stakeholders during the engagement process. The material ESG factors identified remain similar 

to those in previous years in line with the stability of the structure of our business. The set of material ESG factors 

determined in this robust manner ensures relevancy and accuracy.

The Sustainability Task Force assessed and ranked the material ESG factors based on the urgency and scale, 

and it advised management to deploy the Group’s resources accordingly. There was a significant re-ordering 

of the Group’s priorities towards material ESG factors compared to previous years, as we focused on our people 

during the ongoing pandemic. Many social material factors were elevated in our assessments. Occupational 

Health and Safety became the Group’s top ESG concern.

ECONOMIC IMPACT OF COVID-19

President Joko Widodo issued a public health emergency decree on 31 March 2020, whereby extensive 

movement restrictions, business and school closures were mandated. Indonesia has also closed its borders to 

international travel, except in special cases. At this time, Indonesia had in place a partial lockdown whereby 

public and commercial activities were restricted to certain hours of the day. These measures are critical to 

prevent the catastrophic spread of COVID-19 in the country. Inevitably, the pandemic control measures had 

major economic consequences across the country. The Group’s management promptly organised its teams 

to work closely with customers and suppliers to tide through the difficult period together.

Impact on Customers

As a result of the lockdowns and border closure, business activities of commercial and industrial customers 

served by the Group decreased and sales volume to these sectors dropped. However, due to an increased 

hygiene awareness during the pandemic, there was an increase in sales volume in the residential sector.

Nonetheless, with a widespread business contraction in the country, many of our customers had to delay their 

bill payments to us, which caused some temporary cashflow disruptions. As restrictions eased in the second 

half of the year, our collections improved. As of 31 December 2020, Moya has managed to maintain a positive 

operating cash flow. With prudent financial management and the support of our banks, we have managed to 

stabilise our business with our customers.

Impact on Suppliers

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted businesses and supply chains globally. Several of our suppliers were 

not able to ship out their products in time during the year. In 2020, 60% of Moya’s overseas suppliers faced 

shipping delays, which in turn slowed down some of our operations. In addition, protocols implemented by the 

government also restricted operations in the field. These delays resulted in the rescheduling of various projects, 

such as the construction of Water Treatment Plant-7 at PT Moya Tangerang (“MT”) which was delayed by four 

months, and an uprating project at TKCM, which was delayed by 2 months.

In addition, our management responded by actively sourcing for alternative supply sources. For locally 

sourced materials, alternative suppliers were found for all resources required by the Group. As for imported 

resources, most were requested and received early in the year and had little impact. These actions have been 

incorporated into our business continuity policies and will serve the Group well in the long term.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (GRI 403)

COVID-19 Safety and Security Measures

In the densely populated city of Jakarta in which we operate, and like the experience of many large 

organisations, we could not completely protect our staff from COVID-19 infections. However, with prompt action 

and strict implementation of safety measures since the onset of COVID-19, we were able to contain the COVID-19 

infection rate to less than 10% of our total workforce. No staff was terminated for any COVID-19-related issues.

The Group mobilised its health, safety, and operational security plan to protect its workforce and water treatment 

facilities at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Indonesia. Our safety and security policies were then 

expanded in line with the Guidelines for COVID-19 Prevention and Control in the Office and Industrial Workplaces 

issued by the Minister of Health of the Republic of Indonesia.

MATERIALITY 

ASSESSMENT

Several of Moya’s operations which interface with the public at large expose our staff to health and safety 

risks. Management has developed strict ‘health and safety’ protocols when dealing with the public across the 

Group. These initiatives undergo periodic reviews to ensure their operational relevance and effectiveness. These 

measures help to safeguard our employees while providing assurance to our customers.

Apart from these measures, Moya expanded its healthcare to employees to include the provision of free medical 

masks, hand sanitizers, and hand wash while they were onsite. Routine workplace cleaning and disinfection 

were also carried out to maintain a safe hygienic environment.

COVID-19 rapid tests were also done regularly on employees to further ensure their safety. Any positive cases 

detected among our staff would be immediately followed-up by tracing, monitoring, Polymerase Chain Reaction 

(PCR) tests, and medical treatment. As an additional protection for our employees, Moya is also gradually 

rolling out vaccinations for our workers and their families.

Work-Related Safety

For the third consecutive year, Moya has managed to prevent any work-related fatalities. The established 

Occupational Safety and Health Management Committee (P2K3) has full authority regarding the management 

of Occupational Health and Safety (“OHS”) and the environment, and are striving to further improve the 

performance and reliability of OHS and Environmental management systems.

WATER AND EFFLUENTS (GRI 303)

With climate change becoming an increasingly serious issue, water resources are severely affected in many 

parts of the world. In areas like Jakarta, which are prone to annual floods, water security becomes a more 

pressing concern.

Water being a vital resource to both the community as well as to nature, Moya is fully committed to reducing 

the various adverse environmental, social, and economical impact of our operations by investing in the latest 

technologies. As one of the leading water suppliers in Indonesia, Moya sets strict standards by adhering closely 

to all government regulations and compliances regarding the withdrawal of water from designated sources.

In 2020, facing the sudden COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in water consumption by affected 

communities, as well as for temporary facilities such as hospitals and service kitchens. Moya provided 

emergency water supplies to many pandemic-hit areas. Coupled with the acquisition of TKCM and PT Traya 

Tirta Cisadane (“TTC”), these events resulted in a surge in water withdrawal and consumption in 2020.

EFFLUENTS AND WASTE (GRI 306)

The process of water purification produces effluents and waste as an inevitable by-product. As these discharges 

contain chemicals that could be harmful to the environment and the health of local communities, Moya invests 

heavily in the proper treatment and disposal of the sludge generated from its water treatment plants. Sludge 

processors are installed in all of our water treatment plants.

Through rigorous water quality testing and operational reviews, Moya ensures that the water produced by our 

water treatment plants meet all the required standards. Staff training and technical competence is fundamental 

to our water production. Our staff undergoes extensive training and education to highlight any potential 

improvements after each operational review. All these processes help ensure that Moya strictly complies with 

extensive operational rules and regulations on water quality and overall waste management.

In February 2020, Moya completed the construction of two sludge treatment units at TTC and TKCM. These 

sludge treatment units feature cutting-edge sludge dewatering systems. The sludge produced by these systems 

are safely chemically treated and prepared for safe disposal. In addition, water recovery tanks are installed 

to reduce water loss during production, as well as recycling the water produced, further reducing the impact 

on the environment.

Such new systems can result in additional operating costs. Moya is actively switching to environmentally-friendly

ENERGY AND EMISSION (GRI 302, 305)

Moya experienced a considerable surge in energy consumption and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions from 

2019 to 2020. This was due primarily to the consolidation of figures from major new acquisitions of TKCM and 

TTC. Moya’s energy consumption mainly comes from the treatment and processing of raw water. The inclusion 

of TKCM and TTC plants increased our water consumption by 37%, causing the surge in energy and emissions in 

2020.  Management is actively studying various ways to rationalise energy consumption and reduce emissions 

in the new subsidiaries.

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, fewer training sessions were conducted, and each session had to 

accommodate a smaller group of employees to ensure safe distancing. Despite the reduced training hours, 

Moya endeavoured to ensure that sufficient training was provided to staff involved in critical operations. We 

plan to re-establish our training targets as soon as it is safe for our employees to return to classroom training.

LOCAL COMMUNITIES (GRI 413)

Local communities in which we operate are a major stakeholder for the Group, especially during the pandemic. 

Development of local communities is a classic demonstration of the circular economy in our business.

During the construction of a water treatment plant in West Semarang, 40% of employees consisted of workers 

from local communities. On top of that, Moya has engaged local communities through a myriad of programs 

in line with our Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) pillars.

In 2020, Moya further provided clean water connections to several schools, mosque, less fortunate communities, 

as well as public facilities. We believe that having access to clean water should be a basic right and these 

connections help to reinforce the culture towards clean water usage.

During the pandemic, the community faces an increasing need for clean water. AAJ has helped to provide 

clean water to 40 public washing stands. These stands, located at bus stops, allows passengers to wash their 

hands before and after their commute and helps to promote community hygiene. AAJ also helps to supply 

water to public kitchens serving various Emergency Hospitals set up in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

to SMP Negeri 1 Jayanti. This is aimed at improving the learning experience for the students and to spur their 

desire for knowledge and development.

In an effort to further improve both the welfare and competency of our workforce, Moya has established 

an education program for our employees and their children. In 2020, we founded the ‘MOYA ACADEMY’ in 

collaboration with Politeknik Harapan Bersama, Tegal, which provides scholarships to those who wish to further 

their studies and contribute back to Moya and society in the future. This supports students who wish to pursue 

mechanical and electrical engineering degrees, which are qualifications that are fundamental to Moya’s water 

treatment operations.

DONATIONS

The pandemic and lockdowns affected the livelihoods of many households in Indonesia. This was especially felt 

in Jakarta due to the high rate of infections in a densely populated city. Coupled with lockdowns in a high-cost 

city, many families experienced financial hardship in Jakarta.

In light of this, AAJ and MT made several donations to various charity organisations to support their efforts to 

deliver aid to many hard-hit communities.

The areas around Jakarta were also hit by a major flood at the start of 2020. The flood severely impacted the 

community as it also disrupted the supply of electricity. Through channels such as the East Jakarta Mayor and 

DKI Provincial Government, Moya made donations in the form of food aid packs as well as monetary donations 

in an effort to alleviate the damage caused by the floods.

NATURE CONSERVATION

Through river widening projects, AAJ has managed to help reduce flooding in Buaran for its surrounding 

residence. Flooding not only damages properties in the area, disrupts people’s lives, but also causes 

contamination in the water supply which the residents heavily rely on. This project exemplifies Moya’s 

commitment to the provision of clean water and their care and concern to the local communities. The widening 

projects in 2020 has helped ease flooding in areas affecting approximately 3,900 residents in 13 different 

suburbs.

CASE STUDY 1: PLANTING A GREENER TOMORROW

In 2020, Moya has identified the importance of maintaining nature’s greenery, especially in 

our areas of operation. As nature’s own filtration system, a healthy forest system can help 

filter sediments and various other pollutants, preventing them from reaching the water 

bodies, which results in cleaner water.

In September 2020, as part of the Nature Conservation arm of Moya’s CSR, AAJ partnered 

with the Natural Green Lestari Foundation to plant 1600 tree roots along the conservation 

areas in Sukabumi. The seeds planted consisted of nutmeg, clove, banyan, and coconut 

trees, and were planted along the upper banks of the Cikaso river.

In October 2020, Moya partnered with management of the Cidurian River Basin to plant 

fruit trees along the Pasar Baru Dams. The aim of this project was to bolster the sustainability 

of the rivers.
