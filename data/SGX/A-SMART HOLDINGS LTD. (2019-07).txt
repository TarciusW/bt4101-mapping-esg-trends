SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OPERATIONS 

During FY2019, the Group acquired controlling stakes in two newly incorporated property development 

companies in Timor-Leste, namely Timor Marina Square S.A. and Timor City Square S.A., and their principal 

businesses are as follows:

TIMOR MARINA SQUARE

Dili, Timor-Leste

In March 2019, Timor Marina Square S.A., in which the Group owns 60% as at 31 July 2019 and increased to 

69% on 4 October 2019, entered into an agreement to develop two blocks of 20-storey mixed development, 

comprising retail, luxurious residential apartments and offices, in Timor-Leste. Upon completion of the 

development, it will be an awed landmark primed to target investors from China, Taiwan and Singapore.

TIMOR CITY SQUARE

Dili, Timor-Leste

Timor City Square S.A., in which the Group owns a 60% stake, has acquired a 99-year leasehold Surface Rights 

over the project site. Under Timor-Leste laws, the Surface Rights allow companies holding such rights to 

establish a horizontal property regime for the land which in turn, allow for properties built on the land to be 

sold and owned by third party buyers. Given that there will be an allowance of 9 years till commencement of 

construction works for Timor City Square, the Group intends to build temporary structures in the interim, such 

as workers’ dormitory and a wholesale centre, with the intention of generating rental income from it.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

A materiality assessment in the form of surveys was conducted in FY2019, where we identified sustainability 

factors that were material to our business operations. The management and employees who are responsible 

for the key functions of the Group have participated in preparing the Report, assisted the Group in reviewing 

its operations, identifying key ESG issues and assessing the importance of these issues to our businesses and 

stakeholders. We have compiled a questionnaire in reference to the identified material ESG aspects to collect 

the information from relevant departments and business units of the Group. The Group’s material sustainability 

aspects will be covered in this Report and the materiality matrix is as follow:

ECONOMIC

   ANTI-CORRUPTION

The Group strives to achieve high standards of ethics in our business operations and does not tolerate 

any corruptions, frauds and all other behaviours violating work ethics. Unethical or illegal events such as 

corruption, bribery, and collusion are strictly prohibited. We stipulate the disciplinary code and code of conduct 

in the Employee Handbook, and encourage employees to report any suspected misconduct. 

We communicate and educate all our employees with the anti-corruption procedures. We also share our anti-

corruption policies to our clients, business partners and suppliers. The composition of employees and details 

of business partners that the Group’s anti-corruption policies and procedures have been communicated to are

   WHISTLE-BLOWING POLICY

In accordance with the Code, the Audit Committee (“AC”) has put in place a whistle-blowing policy to provide 

arrangements whereby concerns on financial improprieties or other matters raised by whistle-blowers will be 

investigated and appropriate follow up action will be taken. Under such whistle-blowing procedures, employees 

are free to submit complaints confidentially or anonymously to the Chairman of the AC who is well known to 

many employees and easily accessible. All complaints are to be treated as confidential and are to be brought 

to the attention of the AC. Assessment, investigation and evaluation of complaints are conducted by or at the 

direction of the AC. If it deems appropriate, independent advisors will be engaged at the Group’s expense. 

Following investigation and evaluation of a complaint, the AC will then decide on recommended disciplinary or 

remedial action, if any. The action so determined by the AC to be appropriate shall then be brought to the Board 

or to the appropriate senior executive staff for authorisation or implementation respectively.

The AC receives reports relating to serious offences and criminal activities in the Group and reports such 

matters to the Board at the Board meetings. The AC and the Board have access to the appropriate external 

advice where necessary. Where appropriate or required, a report shall be made to the relevant government 

authorities for further investigation or action. The AC is updated annually or from time to time on any changes 

to the accounting and financial reporting standards by the external auditors. No former partner or director of 

the Group’s existing auditing firm has acted as a member of the AC.

There were no whistle-blowing reports received during FY2019.

ENVIRONMENTAL

   ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

The Group strives to protect the environment through the implementation of control activities and monitoring 

measures in its business activities and workplace. We are committed to promoting a green environment by 

introducing environmentally friendly business practices, educating our employees to enhance their awareness 

on environmental protection and complying with the relevant environmental laws and regulations. During 

FY2019, the Group has not identified any material non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations, 

including but not limited to “Environmental Protection and Management Act” and “Environmental Public 

Health Act” in Singapore.

   ENERGY CONSUMPTION

Electricity consumption accounts for a substantial part of the energy usage of the Group in our operation. The 

Group continues with initiatives to introduce resource efficiency and eco-friendly measures to the Group’s 

operations, and is committed to optimising the use of resources in all of its business operations. We encourage 

our staff to implement energy conservation initiatives in the office such as switching off unnecessary lighting 

and idling equipment or computers when not in use or after working hours, adopting power-saving features 

for office equipment and computers and procuring energy efficient appliances only upon replacement of old 

appliances or due to new business needs.

The Group strives to be a role model for incorporating environmental protection into business operations and 

supports the investment in renewable energy. During FY2019, 20% of total power consumption is clean energy 

generated from solar systems by Sunseap Energy.

During FY2019, the electricity consumption of the Group was approximately 596,055.00 kWh and its intensity 

was approximately 86,135.12 kWh per S$ million revenue. We target to maintain or reduce the electricity 

consumption intensity in FY2020.

The detailed summary of the electricity consumption of the Group is as follow:

INDICATOR

AMOUNT CONSUMED (kWh)

86,135.12

Note:

1. The total revenue of the Group during FY2019 is S$6.92 million. This number would also be used for calculating other intensity data in 

this Report.

   WASTE MANAGEMENT

As an organisation involving printing business, we require large amounts of ink chemicals for our print 

products. The proper management of waste is important to the communities where we operate and thus, we 

are committed to disposing waste chemicals responsibly.

We have a dedicated team of experienced handlers that store chemicals in the designated safe areas, so that the 

risk of any chemical leaks can be minimised. These safe areas are under surveillance and can only be accessed 

by authorised personnel. The Group has obtained the Petroleum and Flammable Materials Storage Licence 

from Singapore Civil Defence Force for storing the chemicals in the designated areas. The Group is aware of 

the negative effects that inappropriate handling and disposal of chemical waste can have on the environment. 

Therefore, the Group engages a NEA licensed waste management company to handle the disposal of chemical 

waste.

In addition, the Group also has, as part of the Emergency Response Plan, guidelines on how to respond to 

accidents or hazardous events resulting from chemical spills or fire.


A-SMART HOLDINGS LTD.  Sustainability Report 2019 | 11

ENVIRONMENTAL

   GREENHOUSE GAS (“GHG”) EMISSIONS

The consumption of electricity at the office is the largest sources of indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2) of the 

Group. Aiming to minimise carbon footprint, the Group has implemented measures to ensure efficient use of 

electricity, which are stated in the section “Energy Consumption”. During FY2019, the total GHG emissions 

of the Group was approximately 199.70 tCO2e and its intensity was approximately 28.86 tCO2e per S$ million 

revenue. We target to maintain or reduce the GHG emissions intensity in FY2020.

The detailed summary of the GHG emissions of the Group is as follow:

for Sustainable Development, the latest released Singapore’s Grid Emission Factor, “Global Warming Potential Values” from the IPCC 

Fifth Assessment Report, 2014 (AR5).

   WATER CONSUMPTION

We promote behavioural changes at office and encourage water conservation. We encourage our employees 

to turn off the tap when not in use and report leaking faucet or pipe to the relevant authority. The only source 

of water the Group consumed is from municipal water supplier. During FY2019, the water consumption of the 

Group was approximately 285.30 m3 and its intensity was approximately 41.23 m3 per S$ million revenue. The 

Group did not recycle or reuse any water.

   RAW MATERIAL

Paper makes up a substantial portion of the Group’s inputs and remains the main raw material used throughout 

the Group’s business operations. To promote environmental sustainability and protect trees, the Group believes 

management of paper use is essential for the business.

To reduce the amount of paper used as well as paper waste generated, our sales team works very closely with 

our customers to ensure customers’ requirements are interpreted correctly. Our production team calibrates 

the design of print jobs to ensure the optimal use of paper. Upon request by customers, we use paper with 

recycled content to mitigate resource consumption. Our employees are well-trained in the areas of efficient 

cutting, binding techniques and printing colour control which further reduce paper waste. Unusable waste 

papers are treated as non-Forest Stewardship Council (“FSCTM”) label usage and could be sold to scrap dealers 

for recycling purpose. 

Furthermore, we purchase paper only from responsible certified suppliers, such as those with FSCTM certification 

as FSCTM certified suppliers obtain paper supplies only through sustainable forest management solutions.


12 | A-SMART HOLDINGS LTD.  Sustainability Report 2019

SOCIAL

   SOCIOECONOMIC COMPLIANCE

Socioeconomic compliance is one of the key factors for the Group to obtain social license to operate. The 

management of the Group regularly reviews the business activities, sets up clear policies and procedures in 

advance to prevent potential infringement of related laws and regulations. Employees are also encouraged to 

report suspected cases of violation in any laws and regulations. During FY2019, there were zero incidents of 

non-compliance with relevant material socio-economic laws and regulations. We aim to maintain this trend 

for the forthcoming year.

   RECRUITMENT AND DISMISSAL

Human resources are the foundation to support the development of the Group. We believe that every employee 

plays a vital role in executing good service experience for our customers. Therefore, we dedicate in offering 

a pleasant working environment that encourages communication, innovation, continuous learning and 

fosters employee engagement. Hence, we established relevant policies to fulfil our vision on people-oriented 

management and to realise the full potential of employees. The human resources management procedures 

are formally documented in the Employee Handbook, covering employment contract, promotion, performance 

evaluation, transfer, training, working hours, welfare and remuneration. 

During FY2019, there were no instances where a significant portion of the organization’s activities were 

performed by workers who are not employees.

Any termination of recruitment contract should be based on reasonable, lawful grounds and internal policies, 

such as the Employee Handbook. The Group strictly prohibits any kind of unfair or illegitimate dismissals. For 

those who have poor working performance or constantly make mistakes, the Group would warn verbally before 

issuing a warning letter. For those who remain untamed despite making the same mistakes repeatedly, the 

Group would dismiss the person according to relevant laws.

   REMUNERATION AND BENEFITS

The Group respects the effort put by each of our employees building the success of the Group. Our employees 

are remunerated at a competitive level and rewarded according to their performance. The remuneration 

package includes not only diverse types of leaves but also insurance and cares, which is detailedly stated in the 

Employee Handbook. Such leave types include but not limited to medical and hospitalization leave, marriage 

leave, national service (“NS”) leave, compassionate leave, maternity and paternity leave. With our E-Leave 

System, our employees are able to apply their leave and check their leave balance before applying for leave 

through the online portal. 

Also, the Group provides medical treatment including outpatient medical and dental care, life insurance, the 

Group Travel Insurance Policy and an Insurance Scheme covering maternity expenses, hospitalization and 

surgical expenses. Other benefits and protection for our full-time employees include the Central Provident 

Fund (“CPF”), allowance for overseas business trips, reimbursement claims, and the Long Service Awards that 

will be given to employees who have completed at least 5 years of service. 

The Group adopted the A-Smart Employee Share Option Scheme 2018 (“A-Smart ESOS”) to provide an 

opportunity for employees and directors of the Group to participate in the equity of the Group so as to motivate 

them to greater dedication, loyalty and higher standards of performance, and to give recognition to those who 

have contributed significantly to the growth and performance of the Group.

During FY2019, no employee has taken parental leave, and no share options have been granted under the 

A-Smart ESOS.

   DIVERSITY AND NON-DISCRIMINATION

We practise transparency and equal treatment in recruitment, remuneration, promotion and benefits aspects. 

Performance targets are mutually set and agreed with employees and desired behaviour aligned to the 

Group’s values are shared with the employees. All employees are given fair opportunities based on objective 

assessment, regardless of gender, race, marital status, disability, age or family status.

   OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

The Group highly prioritises workers’ safety in the organisational value system as employees are our key assets. 

Thus, we are committed to maintaining a healthy and safe workplace for employees. To prevent workplace 

injuries and illnesses, we conducted training and set up safety procedures to improve occupational health and 

safety awareness of the employees.

SOCIAL


A-SMART HOLDINGS LTD.  Sustainability Report 2019 | 15

SOCIAL

We developed the Occupational Health and Safety and Security Policy, monitored by all managers and 

supervisors, to prevent all occupational injuries and illness by achieving the following:

• 

Identifying and reducing the risks of all types of work activities that have the potential to produce personal 

injury;

• 

Providing instructions, training and supervision to improve individual’s understanding of workplace 

hazards, including safe work practices and emergency procedures;

• 

Involving individuals in occupational health and safety matters and consulting with them on ways to 

recognise, evaluate and control workplace hazards;

• 

Ensuring that everyone (including visitors and sub-contractors) complies with appropriate standards and 

workplace directions to protect their own and others health and safety at work; and

• 

Providing adequate systems and resources to effectively manage rehabilitation and return to work 

processes.

We also set up Risk Management Team, led by our Office Support Executive and composed of workers 

from different designation, in order to proceed risk assessment in our operation location, modify Safe Work 

Procedures and formulate Risk Management Implementation Plan. Suitable employees are designated as 

safety personnel and sent for Occupational First Aid Courses at government approved centres. Additionally, 

we review our Emergency Response Plan regularly and we are certified by the Singapore Civil Defence Force 

for fire safety works in our office completed satisfactorily in accordance with the requirements of the “Fire 

Safety Act”.

During FY2019, we assessed our laser cutting machines involved in our printing business for improvement 

regarding health and safety impacts. As laser cutting machines release fume which is related to our workers’ 

health concerns, improvement is made on safety procedures to ensure plastic doors must be closed at all 

times during the laser cutting process to avoid creating any health issues for our employees.

During FY2019, the Group encountered zero workplace fatalities. There was 1 workplace injury involving finger 

injury and a total of 6 lost man days. The injury rate and lost day rate were 6.62 and 39.73 respectively, based on 

a million hours worked. The Group has not identified any material non-compliance with laws and regulations 

relating workplace health and safety. We target to maintain zero incidents of non-compliance resulting in 

regulatory breaches related to relevant health and safety legislation in FY2020.

   TRAINING AND EDUCATION

The Group regards its staff as the most important asset and resource as they help to sustain its core values 

and culture. 

Our Training and Development Policy encourages employees to upgrade their skills and enhance their 

knowledge. The Human Resource (“HR”) Department is responsible to facilitate any staff development activities 

and processes. The Group supports employees to participate in personal and professional training including 

formal training sessions (individual or corporate), employee coaching and mentoring, on-the-job training, job 

shadowing, job rotation and participate in conferences. As part of our learning and development provisions, we 

will also arrange for job-related subscriptions or educational material, so employees will have access to news, 

articles and other materials that can help them become better at their job.

As a company providing a full range of print management services, we are certified according to the FSCTM 

standards and conducted FSCTM trainings to equip our workers with knowledge on FSCTM overview, job folder 

and cutting ticket. Externally, we occasionally engage experts to organise trainings such as equal employment 

opportunity training, diversity training, leadership training for managers and conflict resolution training for 

employees. Internally, our managers and experts conduct training programs to train new employees, to train 

teams in company-related issues (e.g. new systems or policy changes) or to train employees to prepare them 

for promotions, transfers or new responsibilities.

During FY2019, the Group invested a total of 54.5 training hours on employees who were sent for training. The

SOCIAL

   PROCUREMENT PRACTICE

The Group highly values its relationship with its suppliers and consultants, and regards them as important 

business partners. As a company providing a full range of print management services, our major suppliers 

include paper suppliers for our printing business.

To ensure our suppliers have met our requirements in regards to quality as well as environmental and social 

standards, we have formulated an approved list of paper suppliers who are FSCTM Chain of Custody (“COC”) 

certified and the types of FSCTM paper they carried. The material categories such as labels on packing and 

claim in invoice are also included for easy reference. The Purchasing Executive is responsible for compiling 

the record of suppliers and searching from the FSCTM Database for the information of FSCTM certified suppliers. 

If possible, FSCTM paper samples would be collected from the certified paper merchant for reference purpose.

   LOCAL PROCUREMENT

To give back to society, the Group strives to select local suppliers for our business operation so as to support 

local companies, create job opportunities for local community, promote local economic development and fulfill 

our social responsibilities. We define suppliers in Singapore as local suppliers and the local procurement 

performance of the Group is as follow:

   CUSTOMER HEALTH AND SAFETY

The Group values customers’ health and safety impact brought by its services and products. We have established 

appropriate policies and measures to maintain product and service quality in order to protect customer health 

and safety. The relevant policies and measures instruct the appropriate and standardised steps taken by 

employees when providing services to its customers. 

During FY2019, the Group has not identified any incidents of non-compliance with regulations or voluntary 

codes concerning the health and safety impacts of products and services.

   CUSTOMER PRIVACY

At all times, the Group is committed to protecting customers’ privacy during our operation and paying attention 

to data security. To comply with privacy-related laws and regulations, including but not limited to the “Personal 

Data Protection Act”, an outsourced professional company was engaged to handle the destruction of personal 

information of our customers. We strictly follow the off-site and on-site shredding processes provided by 

professions and are accredited with the Certification of Destruction, in order to mitigate the risk of non-

compliance and leakage of personal data.

The Group has developed its own Information Labelling Procedure to ensure that all staff are aware of their 

individual responsibilities in relation to the appropriate labelling and classification of information. The procedure 

gives clear instructions on how to manage restricted documents and lists out each level of confidentiality for 

each individual department. Any employee that is found to have violated the procedure may be subject to 

disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

During FY2019, the Group did not receive any substantiated complaint concerning breaches of customer 

privacy, or any leaks, thefts, and loss of customer data.
