OTHER INFORMATION


However, business sustainability is not new to us. 2019 

marks our 120th anniversary – we have always focused 

on non-financial factors that contribute to the long-term 

viability of our businesses. 

2018 has once again been a strong year for 

Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage (“JC&amp;C” or “the Group”) 

producing solid results. We were also ranked the third 

highest among the Straits Times Index constituent 

stocks with 18% annualised total returns, over a 10-year 

period. Underpinning our strong shareholder returns is 

our consideration of environmental, social and 

governance processes, practices and policies. 

Our long history investing in Southeast Asia has enabled 

us to develop deep insights and a strong network in the 

region. It is our valued partnerships with customers and 

communities, business associates and suppliers, and 

employees that drive our performance.

In 2018, we continued and expanded our stakeholder 

engagement, working with a range of stakeholders 

from employees and shareholders, to regulatory bodies 

in Singapore and Malaysia on sustainability topics that 

are material to us. Our material sustainability topics are 

confirmed and overseen by the Board, with supervision 

extended through the JC&amp;C Executive Committee where 

material topics are managed and monitored.

Sustainability for JC&amp;C extends to our approach to 

investments: our Southeast-Asian focused investments 

are long-term and strategic in nature. Our investment 

decisions are rooted in the fundamentals of the 

industries. Our priorities are never based on short-term 

metrics alone – we have a track record of investing in 

companies with robust financial performance, strong 

leadership, sound governance and long-term potential. 

W

e are pleased to share 

our Sustainability Report 

2018. Since publishing 

our first report last year, we 

have continued to deepen our 

commitment of ensuring the 

sustainability of our businesses.

OTHER INFORMATION

We are proud of the role our diversified interests play 

in the development of Southeast Asia, by supporting 

the region’s urbanisation as well as responding to 

aspirations of the emerging ASEAN consumer, a growth 

trajectory our consumer-focused interests continue 

to ride on. 

One of our most significant interests in consumer 

products is our presence in the automotive sector. 

Our automotive activities in Singapore, Malaysia and 

Myanmar operate under the “Cycle &amp; Carriage” banner. 

As part of the 120th anniversary celebrations, 

Cycle &amp; Carriage launched a new brand promise 

and tagline “Exceptional Journeys”. The new brand 

positioning encapsulates Cycle &amp; Carriage’s passion 

to create people-focused experiences. Recognising 

the disruptions and shifts in the automotive sector, 

“Exceptional Journeys” reflects the brand’s evolution 

from focusing on delivering quality products and services, 

to enhancing the experience for customers, partners, 

employees and communities. 

As we think about what makes our businesses 

sustainable, we must also consider what sustainability 

means to society. Over the past few years we have 

witnessed significant advancements in electric 

vehicles within Asia. In 2018, Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore 

expanded into the material-handling equipment sector 

when we were awarded the BYD electric forklifts 

distributorship. BYD is one of China’s leading automotive 

companies and is paving the way in electric vehicle 

development. The BYD electric forklifts are powered by 

the revolutionary lithium iron phosphate battery that 

drives operational efficiency, generating higher cost 

savings with zero emissions. The partnership with BYD 

expands Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore’s offerings and 

strengthens its technical expertise and readiness for 

further electric vehicle roll-out. 

Our people are at the heart of the long-term success of 

our businesses. We are delighted to share that in 2018, 

Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore was named among HR 

Asia’s “Best Companies to Work For”, the fourth 

consecutive year that we have received this award. 

Similarly, our efforts to strengthen stakeholder 

engagement have been acknowledged. JC&amp;C was 

named a runner-up for the “Most Transparent Company” 

at the SIAS Investors’ Choice Awards 2018. 

JC&amp;C is also proud to support the incredible work of 

MINDSET, the Jardine Matheson Group (“Jardines”) 

registered charity that focuses on making a difference 

to the lives of those affected by mental health issues. 

MINDSET was recognised for its contributions, 

receiving the Charity Governance and Transparency 

awards conferred by Singapore’s Charity Council in 

2018. Furthermore, Jardines was named a “Champion 

of Good” by the National Volunteer &amp; Philanthropy 

Centre in Singapore. 

We are heartened by these acknowledgements and 

achievements but recognise that there is still more to 

be done. 

On behalf of JC&amp;C’s Board and Management, we would 

like to express our appreciation to our people and 

partners who have been alongside our 120-year journey 

and we look forward to building a more resilient 

future together.

SUSTAINABILITY AT  

JARDINE CYCLE &amp; CARRIAGE

To this end, it is essential to engage stakeholders and 

identify and manage the material sustainability topics 

that are of importance to both our stakeholders and the 

business. Our focus remains on cultivating relationships 

that are mutually beneficial and enduring as our 

partnerships with customers and communities, 

business associates and suppliers, and employees are 

important factors that drive our performance. 

We believe that each of our businesses should take 

ownership of its long-term sustainability. To effectively 

manage its operations, each business must determine 

what is relevant and important to them. 

SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT  

(GRI 102-18)

According to Singapore’s Code of Corporate Governance, 

the Board of Directors is collectively responsible for the 

long-term success of a company. One of the Board’s 

roles is to provide entrepreneurial leadership, and set 

strategic objectives, which should include appropriate 

focus on value creation, innovation and sustainability. 

At JC&amp;C, the Board is supported by the JC&amp;C Executive 

Committee on managing and overseeing sustainability 

practices, with the JC&amp;C Legal &amp; Corporate Affairs 

department responsible for facilitation and reporting. 

For a full description of Corporate Governance at JC&amp;C, 

please refer to the Annual Report 2018.

JC&amp;C has established a Sustainability Steering Committee 

(“the Committee”) comprising senior management 

from finance, corporate real estate, human resources, 

information technology, legal and operations representing 

JC&amp;C parent company, Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore and 

Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang. Convened in 2017, the Committee 

is tasked with evaluating performance and setting 

sustainability goals, reviewing processes and procedures, 

and supporting the Group in integrating sustainability into 

its culture. The Committee is chaired by JC&amp;C’s Group 

General Counsel who is also the Director of Legal &amp; 

Corporate Affairs, the Company Secretary and a member 

of the JC&amp;C Executive Committee. 

We remain committed to the process of building internal 

understanding of sustainability and the role each of us 

takes in contributing to performance. This year, our 

focus has been on internal processes and environmental 

management. Building on this, we will further develop 

our targets and report on performance going forward.

To ensure the long-term success of our businesses spanning different 

industries and geographies, we need to balance commercial focus against key 

considerations including Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) factors.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

(GRI 102-40, 102-42, 102-43)

We aim to continually engage our stakeholders.  

We are committed to cultivating relationships with 

our stakeholders to build beneficial and enduring 

partnerships by listening and responding to them. We 

engage our stakeholders through a variety of means, 

such as meetings, reviews, discussions, calls, surveys 

and focus groups. 

Having engaged internal and external stakeholders 

for two consecutive years as part of our sustainability 

reporting cycle, our engagement in 2018 reached out 

to external subject-matter experts and was focused 

on understanding the energy and water management 

practices both in Singapore and Malaysia to support 

better environmental practices.

In 2019, we will continue to find the most effective 

channels for interacting with our stakeholders and will 

expand our stakeholder engagement to re-visit our material 

topics and ensure that our ESG focus remains relevant.

MATERIAL TOPICS 

(GRI 102-42, 102-43, 102-44, 102-47, 103-1)

Our sustainability efforts are focused on those topics 

that matter the most to our businesses and stakeholders.

Material topics across JC&amp;C parent company,  

Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore and Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Bintang were established in 2016 following a 

comprehensive materiality process involving context 

review, internal stakeholder engagement, assessment 

of materiality and review by the Executive Committee. 

A shortlist of 22 topics most relevant to our businesses 

was identified by the context review. Through internal 

engagement with JC&amp;C, Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore and 

Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang employees as well as further 

assessment with senior management, the list was 

narrowed down to seven material topics for JC&amp;C parent 

company, and 12 material topics for Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Singapore and Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang.

The material topics were then reviewed again in 2017 

through a process of both internal and external 

stakeholder engagement. 

Our material topics remain unchanged in 2018, allowing 

us to further focus on our ESG management and 

performance. Material topics for 2018 are confirmed 

by the JC&amp;C Board of Directors.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, CG-1)

At JC&amp;C, the Board of Directors is the highest 

governance body. Board Committees comprise the 

Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee and 

Nominating Committee. The Board of Directors is 

responsible for corporate governance, together with 

the management team. 

The terms of reference for the Board and Board 

Committees adhere to the principles prescribed in the 

Singapore Code of Corporate Governance (“CCG”) 

and the SGX Listing Rules.

JC&amp;C has a Corporate Governance Policies Manual  

(“the Manual”) to assist it to comply with the requisite 

corporate governance principles. The Manual sets out 

the terms of reference of the Board and its various 

committees. In addition to the Manual, the CCG and 

the SGX Listing Rules, corporate governance at JC&amp;C 

is also influenced by: 

1. 

the Companies Act and other relevant statutes;

2. 

the Constitution of the Company;

3. 

internal limits of financial authority; and

4. 

various internal guidelines on Board membership, 

renewal, remuneration, performance appraisal, 

independence and other corporate governance-

related matters.

Corporate governance policies and procedures are 

actively monitored and constantly under review and 

assessment, with changes made as appropriate to 

comply with the latest developments in the laws, 

regulations and practices of corporate governance in 

Singapore. Periodic audits are also conducted by 

internal and external auditors on certain aspects of 

corporate governance e.g. financial reporting, risk 

management and internal controls, and reported to 

the JC&amp;C Audit Committee with any issues followed 

up by management. 

To safeguard the interests of our stakeholders, we are committed to high 

standards of accountability. Strong governance, compliance and fair business 

conduct and behaviour are essential standards and values that we uphold in 

operating our businesses. Observing the relevant policies and guidelines is 

important to achieve the necessary controls that are conducive to successful 

operations, reputable business practices and proper risk management.

The JC&amp;C Nominating Committee oversees the 

appraisal of Board performance against a set of 

quantitative and qualitative performance criteria. 

This appraisal is prepared annually by independent 

external consultants, focusing on the criteria of share 

price performance, return on capital employed and 

earnings per share. Company information is compiled 

for review for a five-year period. Share price 

performance is compared against the Straits Times 

Index, the Jakarta Composite Index and a benchmark 

index of industry peers selected by JC&amp;C, with the 

comparison looking at varying periods within the last 

15 years. The components of the peer benchmark index 

and their weightages are reviewed annually to ensure 

that they remain relevant. The results of the comparison 

are set out in a performance benchmark report for the 

Nominating Committee and Board’s review, with any 

issues followed up by management. 

The latest Corporate Governance Report is available on 

the JC&amp;C website. This statement contains further 

details on the responsibilities of the Board and Board 

Committees, and details on regulations, standards and 

evaluations applied.

In 2018, JC&amp;C received an overall rank of #57 in the 

Singapore Governance and Transparency Index 

published by the National University of Singapore 

Business School which provides corporate governance 

performance rating for Singapore-listed companies. 

This is up from #88 in 2017 and #187 in 2016.

At Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore, the corporate governance 

approach meets the same regulatory requirements for 

companies in Singapore as JC&amp;C parent company. It is 

also supported by the Constitutions of the respective 

companies that make up Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore 

and guided by the internal limits of financial authority. 

Periodic audits are conducted by internal and external 

auditors and reported to the JC&amp;C Audit Committee, 

with any issues followed up by management.

Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang operates in Malaysia and is 

listed on Bursa Malaysia. Its Board Charter sets out, 

among other things, the responsibilities, authorities, 

procedures, evaluations and structures of the Board and 

Board Committees, as well as the relationship between 

the Board with the company’s management and 

shareholders. Its Board of Directors, together with its 

senior management team, are responsible for corporate 

governance, with policies and procedures actively 

monitored and constantly under review and assessment. 

Changes to approaches are made as appropriate to 

comply with the latest developments in the laws, 

regulations and practices of corporate governance in 

Malaysia. This includes Bursa Malaysia’s Main Market 

Listing Requirements, the Malaysian Code of Corporate 

Governance 2017 (“MCCG 2017”), and the Companies 

Act 2016, in addition to the following measures:

1. 

Semi-annual return on matters of serious 

concern reporting;

2. 

Semi-annual control and compliance 

assurance return; and

3. 

Quarterly legal report submitted to JC&amp;C 

parent company.

Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang’s Board fully supports the 

recommendations of the MCCG 2017 and is committed 

to applying the recommendations of the code 

(as applicable) to ensure that good corporate 

governance is practised to effectively discharge its 

responsibilities. The effectiveness of this management 

approach is evaluated through engaging professional 

advisors, liaising with the JC&amp;C parent company 

legal team, and certain aspects where applicable  

(e.g. financial reporting, risk management and internal 

controls) are reviewed by internal and external auditors. 

Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang’s Corporate Governance 

Statement is presented in its Annual Report 2018. 

Its latest Board Charter, updated in 2018, is available 

on the company’s website. 

COMPLIANCE 

(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, C-1)

Under the JC&amp;C Board’s terms of reference, its role 

includes reviewing, at least annually, the adequacy 

and effectiveness of the risk management and internal 

control systems, including amongst others compliance 

controls. No cases of non-compliance with laws or 

regulations were identified for JC&amp;C parent company 

or Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore during 2018. Cycle &amp; 

Carriage Bintang received a nominal fine due to an error 

in waste labelling and a delay in filing which has since 

been rectified.

The Jardine Matheson Code of Conduct requires that all 

its companies and businesses comply with the general 

law, with all rules and regulations applicable to each 

business and with proper standards of business 

conduct. This ensures that relevant laws, such as the 

Competition Act, Companies Act, Income Tax Act, 

Personal Data Protection Act, Prevention of Corruption 

Act, Corruption, Drug Trafficking and other Serious 

Crimes (confiscation of benefits) Act and other relevant 

legislation are addressed. Specifically, with regards to 

compliance topics:

• Anti-Competitive Practices. Restricting competition, 

such as price-fixing, non-competition agreements, etc., 

are illegal in certain countries. Senior management 

must be consulted in such cases to ensure it is legal.

• Tax Compliance. Ensuring compliance with all 

tax laws and regulations. 

• Business Licences. Ensuring proper licensing to 

carry on business and not exceeding the scope of the 

licences held. 

• Exchange Controls. Care must be exercised to 

ensure employees do not do anything which is in 

breach of any exchange control laws and regulations 

in countries in which or with which they do business.

• Information Security. Compliance with all 

information laws and regulations, including data 

privacy, data retention and computer security laws. 

Ensuring the safeguard of availability, integrity and 

confidentiality of information by following the 

information security policies and procedures 

applicable to business. 

• Illicit Payments. Employees must not give or 

receive any bribe, other illicit payment or inducement. 

If employees receive, are asked to receive, or become 

aware of any proposal or suggestion to give or 

receive any bribe, other illicit payment or inducement, 

they must report immediately to a member of senior 

management. If they are in doubt whether a payment 

is illicit, they should seek advice. 

• Gifts, Favours and Entertainment. Employees may 

give or receive gifts or favours so long as they fall 

within generally accepted standards of business 

conduct, and are in the ordinary course of their 

duties. No cash payments are permitted.

Overall, JC&amp;C’s Board of Directors is responsible for 

compliance with the applicable laws and regulations, 

together with the senior management team. Each 

department head is responsible for compliance under 

their area of responsibility, with senior managers 

expected to interpret and adapt the policy to their 

operating environment. Additionally, the finance 

department is responsible for compliance with financial 

reporting requirements and tax compliance, with the 

legal department supporting the overall compliance 

requirements of the company. 

Periodic audits are conducted by internal and external 

auditors regarding compliance, with results reported 

to the JC&amp;C Audit Committee and followed up by 

management. Twice a year, management also completes 

a control and compliance checklist prepared by internal 

auditors which covers anti-competitive practices, tax 

compliance, business licenses, exchange control and 

information security, as well as a return on matters of 

serious concern. Quarterly legal and compliance reports 

are also prepared and submitted to the legal department 

for review, highlighting legal and compliance cases, 

disputes and litigation matters. The returns are signed 

off by the business heads and ultimately the JC&amp;C 

Group Managing Director and reported to the JC&amp;C 

Audit Committee for review.

We believe in and encourage the early reporting of 

matters of serious concern that may affect the 

professional and compliant operation of our businesses 

and reputation. In addition to the CoC, we also have 

in place a whistleblowing policy that comes under the 

purview of the JC&amp;C Audit Committee. This ensures 

independent investigation and appropriate follow-up 

action on any concerns raised, including those raised 

anonymously. Any cases reported are monitored 

centrally by appointed management representatives.

Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore also applies the CoC and 

follows the same auditing schedule that is reviewed 

by the JC&amp;C Audit Committee. For Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Singapore, the respective department heads as well as 

the legal, finance, tax &amp; treasury and IT departments are 

responsible for overseeing compliance matters.

Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang also applies its policies on 

dealing in listed securities by Board Directors and 

Principal Officers, Division Standard Operating 

Procedures, Whistle Blowing Policy, Good Compliance 

Practices, and Occupational Safety and Health Manual 

in managing compliance matters. Applicable key laws 

and regulations include the Bursa Malaysia Main Market 

Listing Requirements, the MCCG 2017, Companies Act 

2016, Income Tax Act 1965, Personal Data Protection 

Act 2010, and Environmental Quality Act 1974. The CEO 

and management team are obliged to ensure full 

compliance with the law and applicable regulations. 

Measures to assess compliance include semi-annual 

return on matters of serious concern reporting and 

control and compliance assurance return, quarterly 

legal reports submitted to JC&amp;C parent company, and 

an annual fraud questionnaire completed for external 

auditors. Both external and internal audits are reviewed 

by Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang’s Audit Committee 

and elevated to its Board of Directors if there is any 

non-compliance with the law and regulations or Group 

policies recorded.

TRANSPARENCY AND  

ANTI-CORRUPTION 

(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 205-2)

We are committed to high standards of accountability 

and responsible business. We are of the view that it is 

vital to continue managing our businesses well and 

attract the right people who will uphold our commercial 

standing and reputation. Being transparent and 

combating corruption are necessary to ensure that our 

operations are conducted in a fair and lawful manner. 

The JC&amp;C parent company, Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore 

and Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang adopt the Jardine 

Matheson Group CoC, which sets out policies on illicit 

payments, as well as gifts, favours and entertainment. 

The CoC is aimed at upholding high standards of 

honesty, integrity and fair dealing. The CoC is also 

available on the internal communications platform 

(Workplace by Facebook) and accessible to all 

employees. Updates to the CoC are communicated 

from time to time.

In addition, Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore has implemented 

an anti-corruption clause in its suppliers’ contracts to 

further ethical business practices within its supply chain.

To enable us to better evaluate our anti-corruption 

effectiveness, JC&amp;C parent company and Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Singapore conduct twice yearly control and compliance 

checklists on areas that include illicit payments and 

favours, as well as a return on matters of serious 

concern. Returns are signed off by the business heads 

and management team, and then reported to the JC&amp;C 

Audit Committee for review. At Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang, 

effectiveness of anti-corruption measures is assessed 

in liaison with the JC&amp;C Legal and Risk Management 

teams, with external advisors engaged where applicable.

Effective from October 2015, all new employees are 

provided with a copy of the CoC during onboarding at 

JC&amp;C parent company and Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore, 

and all non-bargainable and sales employees are 

required to undergo a CoC e-learning course. 

Recertification for the CoC e-learning course is required 

every two years. As part of the onboarding process at 

Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore, new joiners are also briefed 

on gifts and entertainment declarations, and referred to 

the General Conduct, Ethics and Discipline Policy.

All new hires at Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang are provided 

with a copy of the CoC and a ‘Good Compliance 

Practices’ brochure during their on-boarding. In 2018, 

all new non-bargainable hires also completed the 

CoC e-learning course that reinforces the Group’s 

principles within one month of joining. A refresher is 

required to be completed every two years. Cycle &amp; 

Carriage Bintang also plans to conduct a refresher 

training for all its employees on the Group’s Good 

Compliance Practices in 2019. The latest version of the 

CoC is updated on Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang’s internal 

communications platform (Workplace by Facebook) 

and website and made accessible to all staff.

A full break-down of the numbers for the 2018

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

(GRI 102-7, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 201-1, 201-4)

The Group generates significant economic value for its 

shareholders from businesses across Southeast Asia.

As a group, JC&amp;C has policies and procedures in place 

to ensure goods and services obtained or paid for 

represent good value and are obtained on fair and 

competitive terms. Employees are treated fairly and 

impartially, and we comply with necessary tax laws 

and regulations. Similarly, we respect the needs of the 

communities that we operate in. In Singapore, where 

we are headquartered, our community initiatives and 

investments are primarily focused on mental health, 

an area that is under-served by the private sector; see 

Engaging our Communities section for further details.

To monitor our financial performance, we actively and 

regularly review and manage our capital structure to 

ensure optimal shareholder returns, considering future 

capital requirements and capital efficiency, prevailing 

and projected profitability, and projected operating cash 

flows, capital expenditure and strategic investment 

opportunities, before the distribution of economic 

value to shareholders.

A significant component of our economic performance is 

also derived from profitability. This is measured regularly 

against budgets, forecasts, and projections assessed on 

a periodic basis. Each business entity under the Group is 

responsible for its economic performance. 

In addition, as a responsible and long-term business, 

we need to be aware of changing market conditions and 

operating landscapes to ensure that we remain relevant 

and competitive, to continue delivering economic value.

We also receive various government financial assistance 

in Singapore in the form of tax relief and tax credits as 

well as certain grants. In 2018, over S$1.1 million was 

received in governmental assistance for our Singaporean 

operations. Of the amounts received in 2018, 74% of 

JC&amp;C parent company’s and 100% of Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Singapore’s tax relief and tax credits were the result of 

statutory rebates and deductions that are provided to 

all Singapore companies. No governmental financial 

assistance was received in Malaysia in 2018.

As listed companies, the financial performance of 

JC&amp;C parent company and Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang are 

audited annually and financial results reported quarterly 

on SGX and Bursa Malaysia respectively. The share prices 

of JC&amp;C parent company and Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang

GOVERNANCE

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

&amp; COMPLIANCE

We will continue to adhere to the principles and guidelines of the  

Singapore Code of Corporate Governance as updated in 2018, and the 

Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 2017, focusing on strong 

corporate governance and maintaining high standards of accountability 

and conduct.

TRANSPARENCY AND 

ANTI-CORRUPTION

We will continue to ensure that all employees of JC&amp;C parent company,  

Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore and Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang are trained 

and abide by the CoC. Our target is to maintain 100% achievement  

year-on-year for training of new hires and re-certification of existing 

non-bargainable and sales employees.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

The Group aims to produce sustained growth in shareholder value. 

We actively and regularly review and manage capital structure to 

ensure optimal capital structure and shareholder returns, taking into 

consideration the future capital requirements of the Group and capital 

efficiency, prevailing and projected profitability, projected operating 

cash flows, projected capital expenditure and projected strategic 

investment opportunities.

FUTURE PLANS AND TARGETS

ENVIRONMENT

Environmental topics have been identified as material for both 

Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore and Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang. The primary activities 

of Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore and Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang involve distributing, 

retailing and servicing of motor vehicles. Through the course of these activities, 

we manage our energy and water consumption together with our waste generation. 

Such environmental factors also serve as indicators of operational efficiency apart 

from the impact on the environment. 

At Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore and Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Bintang, electricity consumption and water usage are 

managed by the Corporate Real Estate service 

managers in both countries with the support of 

externally engaged facilities management team from 

JLL in Singapore. The same team also manages waste 

for Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore, while the aftersales 

service managers are responsible for waste 

management at Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang and apply 

specific procedures as specified in its Scheduled Waste 

Management Safe Working Procedure (SWP).

MANAGING ENERGY 

(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 302-1)

We do not generate our own electricity at Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Singapore and Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang. Electricity is 

sourced from the national grids and electricity consumption 

is based on the utilities bills issued by the respective 

power suppliers in Singapore (SP Services) and Malaysia 

(Tenaga Nasional Berhad).

In 2018, Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore and Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Bintang had a total energy consumption of approximately 

56,662.9GJ. A full breakdown of 2018 data is given in 

the Appendix: ESG Data.

To reduce electricity consumption, Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Singapore is planning to retrofit LED lighting into all 

workshop spaces moving forward.

At Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang, energy saving projects 

were implemented in 2018 including the use of 

energy-saving LED lighting in all new development 

projects. Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang also began the 

replacement of older high bay light fittings with LED 

technology. In addition, it launched a back-office 

awareness campaign using the internal communications 

platform (Workplace by Facebook) and posters that were 

put up across all operations to increase awareness on 

energy conservation. 

BUILDING TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND  

READINESS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES

In 2018, Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore entered the 

material-handling equipment sector. It now represents 

BYD’s lithium iron phosphate electric forklifts as the 

exclusive distributor in Singapore. BYD is a world-leader 

in new energy and battery technologies.

The BYD electric forklifts are powered by the 

revolutionary lithium iron phosphate battery, 

a cutting-edge technology that is set to be the next 

wave in the material-handling equipment space. 

The forklifts are designed to drive operational 

efficiency that will generate higher cost savings 

while offering zero emission and pollution.

“With stricter carbon emission standards and the 

growing importance of corporate sustainability, 

we believe that lithium battery technology will be 

a game changer for the material-handling industry, 

replacing diesel and conventional lead-acid 

electric forklifts. In addition, this exclusive 

distributorship expands Cycle &amp; Carriage’s 

automotive offerings and will strengthen our 

electric vehicle knowledge and expertise which we 

envision will be the future of the industry.”

MANAGING WATER

(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 303-1)

Managing water consumption at our operations is 

important in Singapore and Malaysia, where water is a 

precious resource. It also reduces costs and supports 

the long-term viability of our business operations. 

Water used for the operations is supplied by the national 

water agencies, with supplemental supply provided 

through rainwater collection for Malaysian operations. 

In 2018, Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore and Cycle &amp; 

Carriage Bintang had a total water consumption of 

approximately 176,949m3, as derived from the utilities 

bills issued by the water suppliers in Singapore and 

Malaysia. Malaysia also used an additional 1,233m3 of 

rainwater that it collected at one of its sites in 2018. 

An underground water leakage reported at a Cycle &amp; 

Carriage Singapore facility in 2017 was also rectified in 

2018. A full breakdown of 2018 data is given in the 

Appendix: ESG Data.

MANAGING WASTE AND  

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS 

(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 306-2, 306-4)

Both Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore and Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Bintang ensure continued compliance with the 

respective national legislation on waste disposal by 

engaging licensed waste disposal contractors to collect 

and dispose both hazardous and non-hazardous waste. 

No environmental non-compliance issues were identified 

in 2018, except for a nominal fine received by Cycle &amp; 

Carriage Bintang relating to an error in waste labelling 

and a delayed entry to Malaysia’s eSWIS portal 

(Electronic Scheduled Waste Information system). 

The issue was rectified. In addition, the appointed waste 

vendor provided a briefing to the relevant ground team 

to reinforce correct practices to avoid recurrence.

An estimated 1,482kg general waste was generated in 

2018 by Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang, based on approximate 

extrapolated rates across the larger outlets. All general 

waste collected was disposed to landfill. 

Figures for general waste are not currently available 

for Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore. Waste management 

programmes during 2018 include newly-fitted recycling 

bins at Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore, aimed at increasing 

recycling rates as well as enhancing employee 

awareness of better waste management practices. 

The service centres of Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore and 

Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang generate certain hazardous 

materials such as oily water, used engine oil, used 

batteries, scrap metal and waste sludge. 

In Singapore, the handling, transport and disposal 

method for hazardous materials is agreed upon with 

the engaged contractors licensed by the National 

Environment Agency of Singapore to ensure that the 

hazardous materials are properly managed. Disposed 

waste oil is routed through a recovery process with the 

derivatives routed to further treatment systems and 

disposal externally.

In Malaysia, the disposal method of hazardous 

materials is governed by the Department of 

Environment, Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology 

and Climate Change. Procedures in the handling and 

transporting of hazardous materials to the contractors’ 

premises are established and agreed with the engaged 

licensed waste disposal contractors. Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Bintang’s Scheduled Waste Management SWP further 

dictates additional requirements and procedures for 

waste disposal, including safe storage, labelling, and 

procedure in the event of a spillage. In 2018, Cycle &amp; 

Carriage Bintang added waste water treatment facilities 

at its branches. It also contracted licensed scheduled 

waste contractors to dispose 192,400L of used engine 

oil, with the waste routed through a recovery process 

and the derivatives routed to further treatment systems 

and disposal externally. 

Going forward, JC&amp;C plans to establish a reporting 

system for hazardous materials to be standardised 

across both Singapore and Malaysian operations.

WATER 

We will continue to track both our energy and water consumption at 

Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore and Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang to understand 

our usage. We will evaluate setting reduction targets, specific initiatives 

or cost saving measures over the next reporting cycle.

MANAGING WASTE &amp; 

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

We will seek to standardise the recording of general waste generated at 

our premises in Singapore and Malaysia. We will also consider starting a 

register of waste consignment notes for our hazardous/scheduled 

waste collections.

Looking to the long-term success of our businesses, we value partnerships with 

our stakeholders and community, respect their views and seek to support them 

in a relevant way. 

HEALTH &amp; SAFETY 

(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 403-2, 403-4)

Our people are integral to our businesses and 

operations. The health and safety of our employees 

are paramount in safeguarding the welfare of our 

people and ensuring that our businesses operate 

with minimal disruption.

Health and safety obligations are set out in the 

collective agreements with the respective trade unions 

in Singapore and Malaysia. They include personal 

protective equipment, training or educating employees 

on health and safety topics such as work injury 

compensation, feedback and grievance mechanisms 

for employees and compliance with national health and 

safety legislation.

In Singapore, operations for both JC&amp;C parent company 

and Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore comply with the safety 

and health management arrangements set out in the 

Workplace Safety &amp; Health Act. Each complex has 

designated safety officers who review workplace safety 

guidelines and oversee implementation of measures 

within the work premises. Incidents are recorded and 

investigated as needed, with feedback from accident 

reports applied in addressing and rectifying any 

potential areas for improvement and the prevention of 

accidents. We have attained the BizSAFE 3 standard for 

operations in Singapore.

JC&amp;C parent company and Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore 

also have in place a Workplace Health Programme to 

encourage and engage employees to maintain good 

health. All employees receive complimentary company-

wide health screening every three years and senior 

management undergoes an annual comprehensive 

health screening provided by the company.

Health and safety matters are further managed by the 

Workplace Health and Safety Committee and the 

Company Emergency Response Team for each building 

complex at Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore. The committee 

comprises the complex managers of its six facilities in 

Singapore. The committee is advised by an external 

Group Safety Advisor. Each member of the Emergency 

Response Team is required to undergo training to attain 

certification. Incident report forms are reviewed by 

worker representatives and rectifications are 

recommended and implemented. A whistleblowing 

platform is also available for workers to report unsafe 

work conditions confidentially.

Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang’s operations ensure 

compliance with Malaysia’s Occupational Safety &amp; 

Health Act 1994, with implementation of measures 

together with employee briefings and training on health 

and safety matters provided by the Corporate Real 

Estate service managers at each location of operations. 

In addition, its Occupational Safety and Health Manual 

includes a health &amp; safety policy that guides the way it 

manages operations and sets out procedures for a 

safe working environment. Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang’s 

collective agreement further requires it to establish a 

Health &amp; Safety Committee to oversee occupational 

health and safety matters. 

A full breakdown of our health and safety figures for 

2018 are provided in the Appendix: ESG Data.

EMPLOYEE WELFARE 

(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)

We have always recognised the importance of our 

people to the sustainability and long-term success of 

our businesses.

A human resources policy is in place covering hiring and 

employment including compensation and benefits, as 

well as training and development aspects for both JC&amp;C 

parent company and Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore, while 

Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang has an employee handbook. 

These are reviewed regularly by the respective HR 

divisions, taking into consideration feedback from new 

hire/exit interviews, performance reviews, and employee 

engagement results. The respective HR divisions are 

also responsible for aligning our welfare practices 

across our businesses with legislative requirements 

while evaluating our benefits schemes through insights 

from participation in market surveys.

JARDINE CYCLE &amp; CARRIAGE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

In Singapore, both JC&amp;C parent company and  

Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore ensure the implementation 

of the provisions as stated in the Employment Act,  

while considerations for bargainable employees, such as 

working hours, break times and meal allowances, are set 

out in the collective agreement with the trade union  

in Singapore.

In Malaysia, Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang’s HR division aligns 

practices with the Employees Social Security Act 1969  

and the Employment Insurance System Act 2017, with  

all HR staff attending training on the latest legislative 

requirements. Provisions for the welfare of bargainable 

employees are also set out in the collective agreement 

with the trade union in Malaysia.

The effectiveness of our approach to employee  

welfare is assessed through our employee engagement 

surveys undertaken every two to three years, as well as 

through employee feedback during exit interviews and 

performance reviews, combined with the measurement 

of indicators through data analysis and scheduled 

reporting. Additionally, sampling of employee records is 

reviewed from time to time to ensure legal compliance. 

A grievance procedure for any labour concerns is also 

available to employees.

To better engage with our people, we listen to their 

views and offer an environment that is collaborative and 

productive. Since launching Workplace by Facebook for 

our Singapore operations in December 2017 and for 

Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang in March 2018, 95% of our 

nearly 2,000-strong Singapore-based and Malaysia-

based employees are connected on this internal 

communications platform. This has enabled us to better 

reach out to our colleagues across Singapore and 

Malaysia, and for management to strengthen staff 

cohesion within the organisation.

Our efforts to look after the welfare of our employees 

have not gone unnoticed. In 2018, Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Singapore was named among HR Asia’s “Best 

Companies to Work For” and is the only company to 

have received this accolade for four consecutive years.

OUR WORKFORCE 

(GRI 102-7, 102-8, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3) 

In 2018, JC&amp;C parent company, Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Singapore and Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang employed a 

total of 1,955 staff, nearly all of them based across 

Singapore and Malaysia. JC&amp;C parent company also 

has representative staff members based in Malaysia (2), 

Myanmar (2) and Vietnam (1).

There is good gender diversity within Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Singapore and Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang, especially 

considering the nature of the automotive business 

that they are engaged in.

While the workforce is not influenced by seasonal 

variations and hiring is based on long-term planning 

and demand, Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore and  

Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang also use the flexibility of 

in-house contractors to supplement and support some 

of their business needs, such as new car logistics and 

aftersales. However, most activities are performed 

by their own employees.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 

(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 401-2, 401-3)

Apart from complying with the relevant statutory 

requirements related to employment in Singapore and 

Malaysia, including retirement provision (CPF and 

EPF respectively), SOCSO (social security protection) 

and Employment Insurance System (EIS), we also 

provide benefits such as life and medical insurance for 

all permanent full-time employees in Malaysia effective 

1st January 2018.

We believe in actively supporting working mothers 

and fathers. All employees are eligible for parental leave, 

with childcare leave of an additional six to eight days 

annually for employees in Singapore. We ensure that 

employees receive the statutory maternity leave 

allowance of eight or 16 weeks in Singapore, up to 

four weeks of shared parental leave in Singapore, 

and 60 consecutive days for maternity in Malaysia. 

Since 1st January 2017, all working fathers are also 

entitled to two weeks of paternity leave in Singapore. 

In Malaysia, working fathers receive four consecutive 

days of paternity leave.

In 2018, two employees took parental leave 

(e.g. maternity or paternity leave) at JC&amp;C parent 

company with a return-to-work rate of 100%. As no 

employees took parental leave at JC&amp;C parent company 

in 2017, 12-month retention rates for returning 

employees are not applicable.

At Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore and Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Bintang, 57 employees took parental leave in 2018 with 

a return-to-work rate of 100%. The retention rates for 

employees in 2018 after 12 months from their return 

from parental leave in 2017 are 100% and 79.2% 

respectively for Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore and  

Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang. 

A full breakdown of our parental leave figures for 2018 

are provided in the Appendix: ESG Data.

TRAINING, PERFORMANCE AND  

CAREER DEVELOPMENT 

(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 404-1, 404-2, 404-3)

All employees receive an annual performance and 

career development review1. Apart from reviewing 

performance, the review also serves to align the training 

needs of employees with overall business objectives. 

We believe that developing employees’ capabilities for 

their current and future roles, as well as giving our 

people a voice, are essential to employee engagement 

and retention as well as key to the long-term sustainability 

of the business.

To encourage further learning, we have an Education 

Assistance Programme in Singapore that sponsors 

our employees for further education, providing them 

opportunities for professional and personal development.

At Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore, its Service &amp; 

Development Division together with its motor vehicle 

principals conduct annual technical training for its 

people to enhance their skill sets and expertise. 

In Malaysia, training is provided in line with the 

provisions of the country’s Human Resources 

Development Act. Relevant personnel at Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Bintang are nominated by the individual business units 

and the HR department to attend specific training 

programmes such as Mercedes-Benz certification 

programmes as well as JC&amp;C and Jardine Matheson 

training programmes. Representatives from various 

business units, product training department, and the 

Goal Alignment &amp; Continuous Excellence department 

also work with the HR division to organise internal, 

external and local training programmes as needed.

A full breakdown of training, performance and career 

development reviews in 2018 is given in the Appendix: 

ESG Data.

EMPLOYEE RETENTION 

(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 401-1)

We believe in treating our people well and aim for them 

to grow and build lasting careers with us. In Singapore, 

the average length of stay of our employees is 11.8 years 

and in Malaysia, it is eight years. 

If an employee decides to leave us, an exit interview will 

be conducted to gather feedback. Information gathered 

is reviewed and analysed on a quarterly basis by our 

HR division. A full breakdown of new hire and turnover 

figures for 2018 is provided in the Appendix: ESG Data.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT

We are invested in our employees, and want to foster a 

culture of engagement, value and respect. We believe

seconded overseas. Employees undergoing probation will receive 

a career review upon the completion of their probation period.

this is fundamental in driving the quality and retention of 

our people.

At JC&amp;C parent company and Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Singapore, this includes the annual dinner and dance, 

the annual MINDSET Challenge &amp; Carnival as well as 

regular workplace health activities such as the quarterly 

healthy breakfast for employees. We also support family 

focused initiatives such as “Eat with Your Family Day”, 

where employees finish their workday earlier to spend 

time with their families. 

Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore’s Family Day is an annual 

event where employees and their families go on an 

overseas vacation together at subsidised rates. In 2018, 

150 employees and their families went on a three-day 

trip to Chiang Mai, Thailand. Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore 

also provides Sports &amp; Social Club activities throughout 

the year, such as Go Karting and bowling. Annual 

townhall meetings are also held where the Managing 

Director provides updates on the company’s achievements 

and plans, and exemplary employees are recognised. 

Apart from annual townhall meetings to engage its 

employees, Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang also holds annual 

three-day team building sessions that aim to foster 

team spirit at the department level. Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Bintang also holds a company dinner every two years to 

provide the opportunity for its employees from different 

branches to bond and mingle. 

PREVENTING DATA FRAUD AND THEFT 

(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, DF-1, DF-2, 418-1)

Given the customer-based operations at Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Singapore and Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang, preventing data 

fraud and theft is important to us to safeguard customer 

data and prevent unauthorised use of information. As we 

continue to revamp and develop our websites and 

mobile apps to better engage our customers, we have 

undertaken additional IT security measures to prevent 

security breaches and ensure our digital properties are 

not compromised.

The JC&amp;C Group adopts the Jardine Matheson Group CoC 

where employees must comply with all information laws 

and regulations, including data privacy, data retention 

and computer security laws. 

Availability, integrity and confidentiality of information 

must be safeguarded by following information security 

policies and procedures applicable to their business. 

Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore follows the guiding 

principles as set out by the JC&amp;C parent company 

necessary to establish sound information security 

management, as overseen by the JC&amp;C parent 

company’s Information Technology department. 

Internal and external audits are further conducted and 

reviewed to evaluate the effectiveness of approach and 

processes. The evaluation also enables the update of 

the Information Security Policy to keep up with new 

information security threats.

Relevant information security awareness materials are 

regularly posted on the Workplace by Facebook internal 

communications platform to heighten user awareness 

and educate employees in identifying and responding to 

potential phishing emails. To strengthen internal 

understanding of potential cyber risks, a simulated 

phishing email campaign was conducted in Singapore 

in 2018 to evaluate user responses and further promote 

awareness.

In Malaysia, Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang applies their 

Information Security Policy together with the Personal Data 

Protection Policy. In addition, only authorised users in 

the respective departments can perform data extraction 

or changes to customer, employee or financial records. 

Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang also conducts regular network 

and infrastructure security review and technology 

updates, with only authorised users in the department 

able to perform any network configuration changes.

There was no digital attack incident or digital security 

breach incident recorded in 2018.

ENGAGING OUR COMMUNITIES

We believe in being a business beyond profitability. 

JC&amp;C is committed to growing alongside the 

communities we engage in and developing under-served 

sectors in our community as a part of our overall 

business strategy. 

According to research conducted by the Lien Centre for 

Social Innovation, a thought leader for positive social 

change in Singapore, those with mental illness were 

identified as a vulnerable community in Singapore. 

Headquartered in Singapore, JC&amp;C parent company’s 

community initiatives in Singapore are primarily focused 

on mental health, an area that is under-served and lacks 

meaningful support from the private sector.

OTHER COMMUNITY EFFORTS

In 2018, JC&amp;C parent company, Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Singapore and Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang also supported 

several other community efforts, including in the areas 

of mental health, education and road safety.

JC&amp;C champions the mental health cause in Singapore. 

In 2018, in addition to its contributions towards MINDSET, 

JC&amp;C and Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore supported Mental 

Muscle from the National University of Singapore in their 

fundraising efforts and took part in the Social Innovation 

Festival to educate the public and raise awareness of 

mental health. As part of The Business Times’ Charity 

Auction, JC&amp;C also sponsored two paintings created by 

mental health persons-in-recovery from the Singapore 

Association for Mental Health. The auction provided an 

opportunity to raise awareness of the mental health cause 

among fellow corporates and media partners in Singapore 

as well as contributed to “The BT Budding Artist Fund”. 

Education and governance remain focus areas for us. 

JC&amp;C and Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore continued our 

support of Singapore’s Institute of Policy Studies for 

their contribution towards better policy making and 

responsive governance. In Malaysia, Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Bintang donated to The Otomotif College, a leading 

Approved Higher Education Institution that aims to push 

the boundaries and shape the future of students and 

alumni in the automotive industry in Malaysia.

As a leading automotive dealer group, Cycle &amp; Carriage 

Singapore also gave its support to positively influence 

drivers and pedestrians to practise road safety. As the 

main sponsor for Singapore Road Safety Month 2018, 

Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore supported the Land 

Transport Authority of Singapore’s promotional 

campaign to encourage road safety on print and social 

media channels. 

HEALTH &amp;  

SAFETY

The health and safety of our people are of upmost importance, and it is our 

responsibility as an employer to ensure the health and safety of our employees. 

In 2019, we will continue to standardise our record keeping of health and safety 

issues at Cycle &amp; Carriage Singapore and Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang. We target a 

zero-fatality rate year-on-year.

EMPLOYEE  

WELFARE

Continuous learning and development will remain as a key priority to ensure our 

workforce capabilities remain relevant. We aim to achieve an average of 16 hours 

annual training per employee. In addition, in Singapore, we will continue to retain  

our workforce by keeping turnover lower than the general industry.

PREVENTING DATA  

FRAUD AND THEFT

Despite having zero digital attack incidents or digital security breach incidents in 

2018, we actively continue to take steps to prevent data fraud and theft. We will 

formalise our security review process in 2019 and target zero data theft year-on-year.

ENGAGING  

COMMUNITIES

In Singapore, we will continue to support the mental health cause and keep a record 

of our contributions through MINDSET, whether it is in terms of funding or employee 

volunteering hours or the provision of communications, corporate secretariat, 

finance and legal support. In Malaysia, Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang will continue to 

support community projects that are focused on creating positive social impact.
