Taka Jewellery Holdings Limited

Sustainability Report 2021

We are in the fourth year of our sustainability reporting journey, where we are pleased to present the Sustainability 

Report for Taka Jewellery Holdings Limited, together with its subsidiaries (“Taka Jewellery” or the “Group”) from 1 

July 2020 to 30 June 2021 (“FY2021”). 

The Group remains committed to broaden our business operations and enhance stakeholder value, by reporting on 

our initiatives in relation to key environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) objectives. The Board of Directors 

(the “Board”) strongly believes that in each of the three core areas of our business – Exhibitions, Retail and Financial 

Services – sustainable practices allow us to stay competitive, while delivering results to our stakeholders. 

The Board values the importance of our sustainability commitments in managing the long-term strategy of the company. 

The Board is also responsible for monitoring and overseeing the management of these material environmental, social, 

and governance (“ESG”) matters.

As with FY2020, FY2021 has proven challenging with the effects of a prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, and our wholesale 

and exhibition business segment has been especially impacted. As there are continuous challenges to showcase our 

jewellery in large-scale exhibitions as before, our team have pivoted to showcasing our jewellery on regular virtual 

meetings, promoting our jewellery through digital platforms such as our website for our wholesale customers to browse, 

and holding virtual exhibitions. 

Revenue in our retail stores is largely dependent on the safe management measures adopted at various phases of 

COVID-19. For example, revenue grew when the measures in June 2020 eased to allow more visits to public areas. 

However, after the announcement of Phase 2 Heightened Alert, retail sales saw a corresponding reduction in revenue. 

Nevertheless, we believe strongly in our foothold in this industry, and we have also diversified into digital space to 

combat the volatility of revenue in the retail space. This also gives our customers the opportunity to browse our items in 

the comfort of their homes.

The Board would like to express our gratitude and sincere appreciation to our stakeholders for your unwavering 

support over the years. We strive to brave through this pandemic with your support and develop a more sustainable 

environment for all.

Best wishes,

Taka Jewellery Holdings Limited

Sustainability Report 2021

As a business, we are committed to acting responsibly and reducing the impact of our operations along the product 

supply chain. Our primary focus is ensuring the sustainability of our value chains, so our customers can be confident in 

our products. 

Diamonds and gold are the main items we purchase from our approved suppliers, which are of high quality. We critically 

evaluate all our suppliers based on their expertise, quality and past performance. We are committed to sustainable 

and responsible business practices, and our procurement team evaluates all suppliers based on a set of strict criteria 

ensuring that they comply with local laws and regulations, including ethical business practices. Our long-term 

relationship with our suppliers has been built on strong relationships, and we will continuously monitor the performance 

of our suppliers to ensure that we obtain products from those who are qualified.

There are policies and procedures in place to guide and facilitate the different stages of procurement, including 

selection, comparison, and periodic evaluation. We base our pricing policy on three factors: competitive profit margins, 

bulk purchasing power, and disintermediation. 

Additionally, we have put in place a quality assurance system, which allows us to conduct random checks to ensure that 

diamonds and gold are properly certified by institutions like the Gemological Institute of America (“GIA”).

The outbreak of COVID-19 has had an unprecedented impact on the global supply chain. We are committed to 

maintaining a collaborative relationship with our suppliers and business partners over the long term in order to act 

quickly when new challenges arise. No major disruptions have been experienced by the Group’s supply chains. Based on 

its operating needs, the Group continues to plan and replenish its raw material inventory from suppliers in Singapore, 

China and Hong Kong. In terms of production and supply, the company will closely follow market demand and sales 

forecasts. However, fierce market competition, currency fluctuations, and raw material price fluctuations are expected to 

continue, affecting the Group’s results.  

In FY2021, we received no significant complaints about our products or services. As we move forward, we aim to keep 

complaints to a minimum.

Taka Jewellery Holdings Limited

Sustainability Report 2021

ECONOMIC

PERFORMANCE

The Group’s revenue dipped 15% in FY2021, largely due to lower revenues from the wholesale and exhibition business 

segment, with an overall year-on-year decline of 48%. As a dominant player in major and large-scale jewellery exhibition 

and fairs, the global travel restrictions and cancellation of these fairs have impacted our Group’s wholesale and exhibition 

business segment significantly. In view of this, our team have diversified to showcasing our jewellery on regular virtual 

sales events  as well as promoting our jewellery through digital platforms such as website for our wholesale customers to 

browse and holding virtual exhibitions. 

Our revenue stream in retail depended heavily on the different phases of COVID-19 measures in Singapore. Domestically, 

our retail business segment has risen 10% in sales in comparison to FY2020. In the beginning of the financial year, our retail 

revenue grew following the relaxation of COVID-19 measures in June 2020, showing signs of gradual recovery in sales as 

footfall increased in malls, where most of our Taka Jewellery retails outlets are located at. However, the implementation of 

Phase 2 Heightened Alert, once again, dampened our retail sales. 

In light of the volatility of our retail sales in relation to COVID-19 measures, our Group have taken significant steps to 

reduce any non-essential expenditure, such as capital expenditure and expansion of retail outlets to manage cost. We are 

also more involved in the digital space such as conducting exclusive live webcasts to showcase our products, promoting our 

products through online shopping channels and through social media platforms.

As we progress on to the new financial year, the decision to diversify into money lending business as part of the Group’s core 

business activities would further strengthen our position in growing our revenue sources and to complement our existing 

business activities.

to keep Taka Jewellery updated with the latest regulations 

to prevent and better detect any suspicious transactions. 

With periodic review of any unusual cash transactions, 

such as abnormally large amounts or sudden surges in 

activity level, we are able to monitor and detect activities 

which may require a report. 

We are proud to report that there was no reported case 

of money laundering in FY2021. We aim to maintain this 

record in FY2022.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY

In their periodic review of the Group’s conflict of interest 

policy, the Board addressed general principles related to 

conflicts of interest, guiding key management in identity 

disclosure, and managing potential conflicts identified. 

Upon becoming aware of any direct or indirect conflicts of 

interest related to the Group’s transaction, management is 

required to disclose them. In FY2021, conflict of interest 

declarations has been made by all key management and 

relevant personnel.

CODE OF ETHICS

Employees are expected to follow professional ethics when 

conducting business. This is outlined in the Employee 

Handbook. It emphasizes the need to safeguard sensitive 

and confidential information while protecting the interests 

of the company.

RISK MANAGEMENT 

The Board of Directors, supported by the AC, is 

responsible for risk governance. In order to mitigate 

financial, operational, compliance and information 

technology risks, we have implemented comprehensive 

internal controls on key operations. For these controls 

to be effective, independent audits are required from 

time to time, as well as regular reviews by the Group 

management and Board of Directors.

Please refer to our FY2021 Annual Report for more details 

on the Group’s Corporate Governance structure. In 

FY2021, we maintained zero-reported cases of confirmed 

corruption and wrongdoings. We aim to maintain this 

record in FY2022 and continue to conduct relevant training 

for our employees to increase the awareness of relevant 

channels available for their feedback and concerns.

As part of its corporate governance practices, Taka 

Jewellery aims to ensure transparency in all its processes 

and policies. As a Group, we regard corporate governance 

as a vital component to success. We do not tolerate 

unethical behaviour. We have adopted the revised 2018 

Code of Corporate Governance (the “2018 Code”) and 

practice guidance issued by the Monetary Authority of 

Singapore (MAS). As a guide, the 2018 Code lays the 

foundation for organisations to achieve their vision 

and mission. The Group has established policies and 

procedures on Conflict of Interest, Whistleblowing, and 

Code of Business Conduct as the cornerstones of good 

corporate governance.

WHISTLE-BLOWING POLICY 

We regularly review our whistleblowing policy to ensure 

it is up-to-date, in accordance with our commitment to 

good governance. Details of the whistleblowing policy are 

communicated to all employees via internal memos and a 

copy of the policy is stored on the Group’s internal shared 

drive.

Our whistle-blowing policies and channels allow employees 

to inform us about possible improprieties related to 

financial reporting, misconduct, unlawful activities, and 

other improper activities. The Audit Committee (“AC”) 

will take appropriate disciplinary action following the 

completion of its investigation to protect employees 

against reprisals or victimisation when they submit a 

whistle-blowing report in good faith and without malice.

In FY2021, there were no whistle-blowing reports 

received. As we progress on to FY2022, we aim to 

maintain the zero reports record.

ANTI – MONEY LAUNDERING POLICY

 

We are committed to maintaining professional value and 

integrity. The Group has in place an active anti-money 

laundering framework to remain vigilant for suspicious 

transactions. This allows any suspicious cash transactions 

to be reported to the Suspicious Transactions Reporting 

Office of the Commercial Affairs Department of Singapore. 

Our employees continue to adhere to our Code of 

Corporate Governance, which sets forth the standards of 

conduct and formal disciplinary procedures in the event 

any unethical conduct or malpractices are identified by the 

AC. 

Our employees have received communications on the 

updates to the anti-money laundering framework. Our 

employees have attended training by the Ministry of Law

our lighting to create the desired atmosphere in our outlets, while also assessing energy-efficient methods to conserve 

energy.

We are proud to announce that our total energy consumption has decreased over the board for our headquarters, Taka 

outlets and Top Cash outlets as detailed below. This proves that our conscious steps to monitor and implement energy 

saving measures to improve our energy performance have shown some results. Moving forward, we will continue to 

monitor and hopefully reduce our energy usage for all three locations in FY2022.

Taka Jewellery Holdings Limited

Sustainability Report 2021

We are committed in being a socially responsible corporate citizen and we understand the importance of giving back to 

the society. 

In FY2020, the company had participated in “Walk for Children” which was organised by the Singapore Children’s 

Society to contribute back to the society. We worked with business partners and members of Singapore Children’s 

Society to raise funds and support specialised programmes catered for children and youth. We have also set up booths 

to market costume accessories to help in fund raising.  

In light of the COVID-19 restrictions, we have postponed participation in physical local community programmes events 

until safe management measures have been relaxed to allow such events. 

In the coming financial year, we will continue to actively look for opportunities to contribute to the community to build a 

positive impact in our society.

Customers are increasingly concerned as to how personal data are collected and used. Hence, customer privacy has 

always been of utmost importance, and we seek to prevent any loss of customer data by putting mitigating controls in 

place.  We strictly abide by the rules of our local regulators, the Personal Data Protection Council, and the Personal Data 

Protection Act (“PDPA”). 

Taka Jewellery has implemented data protection policies and procedures which includes the approach on responsible 

data handling and use of data and compliance monitoring. To ensure that our employees keep to the highest standards 

of protecting our customer data, we have circulated the policies to all employees to keep them aware on data handling. 

We have also made in-house training on online data and privacy mandatory for all employees. In addition, we have an 

appointed Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) to oversee the data protection programme within the organisation and ensure 

compliance with PDPA.

The Group has stringent data protection policies and procedures to protect customers’ personal data, such as:

- 

Implementation of cybersecurity measures, such as antivirus protection and password management software, to 

better complement our data protection posture. 

- 

Limited data access rights are given to the employees to ensure that sensitive customer data are restricted to only 

authorised personnel in the Group. 

- 

In Headquarters, we have implemented strict access control over the entry points as well as CCTV surveillance in 

place to detect unauthorised entry or access.

- 

In our retail outlets, we have implemented CCTV surveillance over the filing of documents, and printed documents 

are kept under secure physical safeguards. 

Under the Pawnbrokers Act 2015, we retain our pawn tickets for a period of five years. The physical documents are 

stored with restricted access controls in place. 

In FY2021, we are proud to report that there was no incident of loss of customers’ data and no report of breaches of 

customer privacy. As we move forward to the next financial year, we will continue to do our utmost best in protecting 

our customer data and ensure that customer data are not used for other purposes without customer’s consent.
