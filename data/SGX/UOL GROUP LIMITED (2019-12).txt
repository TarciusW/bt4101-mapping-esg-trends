UOL’s annual sustainability report covers performance data and related information on our material 

environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues for the period 1 January to 31 December 2019  

(FY2019). This report should be read together with our website, which contains additional corporate 

sustainability information such as our Group Sustainability Governance Structure and Enterprise 

Risk Management Framework. For more information on our approach to sustainability, visit  

www.uol.com.sg/sustainability/our-approach. 

The report covers the property development, property investments and hotel operations in Singapore, 

excluding those of listed United Industrial Corporation Limited (“UIC”) but including the common 

associated and joint venture companies of UOL Group and UIC. UIC publishes its own sustainability 

report, which is available on its corporate website. Assets and revenue from operations covered in the 

report comprise approximately 44% of the Group’s total assets and 34% of the Group’s total revenue 

respectively as at 31 December 2019. We intend to expand the scope of reporting to include our overseas 

operations when an operation significantly contributes to our assets or profit i.e. more than 10%.

This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option, and includes 

consideration of the GRI Construction and Real Estate Sector Disclosures. The report also complies 

with requirements of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (SGX-ST) Listing Rules  

Practice Note 7.6 Sustainability Reporting Guide. Definitions and source of data measurements are 

indicated in Appendix B. 

We continue to independently assure our sustainability report to ensure the accuracy and reliability 

of its contents. For FY2019, KPMG was engaged to provide limited assurance using SSAE 3000 to  

ensure alignment of the report with SGX Sustainability Reporting requirements under Listing Rules 711A  

and 711B. The assurance statement can be found on page 65 of this report.

We are committed to listening to our stakeholders. We welcome any feedback to help us improve our 

performance in sustainability and this report. Please send all feedback, questions and comments to 

Head, Corporate Communications &amp; Investor Relations, at sustainability@uol.com.sg.

BOARD STATEMENT

UOL is committed to our vision of creating value, shaping future by conducting our business operations 

in a manner that practises high standards of corporate governance, and considers the environmental 

and social impacts to sustain profitable growth. 

 

The principal responsibilities of the Board include reviewing UOL’s strategic business plans, taking 

into account ESG issues which could impact the business. The Board oversees the management of  

material sustainability issues and their performance indicators. The Board also approves the annual 

sustainability report.

UOL GROUP SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

The Sustainability Steering Committee comprises the Group Chief Executive, Chief Executive Officer 

(PPHG) and other members of the Senior Management team. It makes key decisions, including materiality 

assessment. The Sustainability Steering Committee is supported by the Sustainability Working 

Committee, which comprises representatives across departments including Corporate Communications 

&amp; Investor Relations, Finance, Human Resource, Investment, Legal &amp; Secretariat, Marketing, Project 

Development, Property &amp; Engineering and the Group’s hotel subsidiary PPHG.

 

The governance structure of sustainability permeates functions and seniority, ensuring that 

sustainability is integrated both at operational and strategic levels.

MATERIALITY REVIEW AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENTGRI 102-46

To ensure UOL’s material issues remain relevant and significant to our business operations, we  

conducted a materiality review exercise in October 2018 and a stakeholder engagement survey in 

July 2019, facilitated by an external consultant. The materiality review examined UOL’s 12 existing 

material issues, their targets and commitments to the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development 

Goals (SDGs), local and global corporate sustainability reporting trends, sustainability reporting  

frameworks, as well as benchmarking against industry peers. The stakeholder engagement survey 

allowed our key stakeholders including guests, tenants, business partners, regulators and investors 

to review and determine the ESG issues that were most material to the Group. The survey results 

affirmed that UOL’s 12 material issues remained important and relevant. The Board and Management 

also reviewed the survey results and agreed that the 12 material issues continued to be the 

Group’s key issues of interest. We also renamed three material issues to be aligned with reporting 

trends: Corruption &amp; Bribery, Data Privacy and Carbon Footprint were renamed to Anti-corruption  

&amp; Anti-bribery, Data Protection and Climate Change respectively.

We have mapped our material issues against the SDGs in the following section. More details on our 

material issues are on our website at www.uol.com.sg/sustainability/materiality.

Dear Stakeholders

In 2019, the call for climate change action became even more urgent as the world witnessed significant  

extreme weather, rising sea levels and melting of polar ice caps. Singapore, as a low-lying island state, 

is very vulnerable to the effects of global warming. Our government had also pledged to do its part to  

mitigate climate change together with the international community at the United Nations Climate  

Action Summit last year. 

At UOL, we are in the business of creating inclusive and green spaces that enhances the liveability 

and sustainability of Singapore. We take actions to mitigate the effects of climate change through 

advocating green architecture, adopting innovative construction technologies and embracing digital 

transformation, to reduce our impact on the environment, protect communities, and enhance resiliency 

of the real estate industry. 

Our theme for this report is “Together for the Future”. It envisions every Singaporean and every nation 

coming together to make conscious decisions and efforts to lower our carbon footprint. 

BUILDING A RESILIENT CITY

As a developer, UOL also plays a key role in rejuvenating the cityscape. Avenue South Residence, a 

56-storey development, sits on the doorstep of the Greater Southern Waterfront, which the government 

plans to be a seamless extension of the city and will open up new live-work-play opportunities.  

The development incorporates both greenery – with the preservation of mature trees along its  

boundary of the Rail Corridor, as well as heritage – with the retrofitting of conserved four-storey flats 

from the early days of public housing in Singapore. Avenue South Residence is our second project that 

deploys the prefabricated prefinished volumetric construction (PPVC) method, which helps minimising 

the impact of construction to the environment while increasing productivity and maintaining work  

safety. Upon completion, the development will be the world’s tallest residential project that adopts the 

PPVC method.   

In line with Singapore’s “Year Towards Zero Waste” in 2019, UOL is committed to waste reduction  

through our operations. For our hospitality business, we are transforming Pan Pacific Orchard into the 

first zero-waste hotel in Singapore comprising 347 rooms along the Orchard Road shopping belt when 

it is targeted to open in 2021. Designed to include self-sustaining landscapes that rely minimally on 

energy and water  resources, the iconic hotel will have low carbon footprint and be resource efficient,  

a testament that good design can also be good for the environment. 

SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE IN 2019

As our commercial properties and hospitality business had achieved some of our 2020 environmental 

targets in 2018, we set new long-term goals in 2019 for the year 2030.

During the year, our commercial properties achieved a 17.7% reduction in energy intensity by GFA 

occupied and a 14.9% reduction in water intensity by GFA occupied, compared with the base year of  

2010. We aim to achieve a 25% reduction of energy intensity by GFA occupied and a 25% reduction of 

water intensity by GFA occupied by 2030, compared with the base year of 2010. 

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE STATEMENT

Our hospitality business achieved a 26.5% reduction in energy intensity by guest night and a 24.3% 

reduction in water intensity by guest night in 2019, compared with the base year of 2013. We target to 

attain a 30% reduction of energy intensity by guest night and a 28% reduction of water intensity by  

guest night by 2030, compared with the base year of 2013.  

As most of our development projects are in their piling and structural construction stages, where 

diesel generators are the main source of energy, we recorded an increase of 39.3% in GHG emissions  

intensity by value of work completed and an increase of 4.8% in water intensity by value of work 

completed year-on-year. 

We maintained a good safety record in 2019, with an accident frequency rate of 0.5, a decrease 

from 2018. We continue to strive for zero incidents at our workplaces, maintaining high standards of  

occupational health and safety standards across all development projects.

COMMITMENT TO STAKEHOLDERS

Stakeholder feedback is important to us when we develop our sustainability approach and initiatives, 

as we can better prioritise activities among the material issues critical to us. During the year, we 

conducted a stakeholder engagement exercise and the outcome showed that we are aligned with our  

stakeholders in our sustainability efforts.

TOGETHER FOR THE FUTURE

This year, the world is facing another extraordinary challenge posed by the COVID-19 outbreak that  

has taken a severe toll on the global economy. It has even changed the way we live, work and socialise. 

In Australia, Pan Pacific Perth stepped forward and opened up its rooms to homeless people to protect 

them during this health crisis. Closer to home, PARKROYAL on Kitchener Road and PARKROYAL on  

Beach Road provided temporary accommodation for Malaysian workers who were affected by the 

lockdown in Malaysia, while Pan Pacific Singapore and PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering served  

as dedicated facilities for returning residents to serve their stay-home notices. UOL is committed to  

playing our part. 

As we navigate this challenging period, the sustainability fundamentals have become even more 

important. I have confidence in the resilience of the Group to weather through this crisis together  

with our employees, business partners, customers and communities, for our future. We look forward  

to your continuous support as we strive to build a better and sustainable future together.

At UOL, we take innovative approaches to create award-winning buildings and hospitality services that 

exceed the expectations of our stakeholders. We also adopt sustainable practices and manage our 

operations in a customer-focused and resource-efficient manner.

We require all our development projects to be certified to the Construction Quality Assessment 

System (CONQUAS) by BCA. We continue to build on the success of our completed project, The Clement 

Canopy, by using innovative technologies such as PPVC for our current development project, Avenue  

South Residence. This building technology not only improves the quality of our buildings, but also  

creates positive social and environmental impacts such as improved workers’ safety and reduced  

dust and noise at construction sites.

Employee development and training is a key factor in the provision of service excellence in our  

hospitality business. We closely monitor in-house guest satisfaction surveys and external reviews 

on multiple platforms, and benchmark our performance via an external Quality Assurance specialist.  

We also invest in new technologies and management systems to enhance service quality.

An Environmentally-Responsible Development that 

Conserves Heritage



Located along Silat Avenue and at the doorstep of Greater Southern Waterfront, Avenue South  

Residence consists of two towers of 56-storey residential apartments with five blocks of four-storey 

conserved Singapore Improvement Trust flats. 

We are committed to the preservation of the existing conserved buildings, which serve as physical 

memories of early-day public housing in Singapore. Through adaptive reuse, key architectural façade 

and some structural elements will be retained in the buildings’ retrofitting.

The two towers are oriented in the north-south direction to allow for natural cooling and airy living  

space, which can reduce energy consumption. The addition of sky gardens also serves to create a 

nature-immersed living environment. A unique feature of the development is its direct connection 

to the Rail Corridor that would encourage residents to be active outdoors and connected to the  

community. Seven mature trees were also conserved with the development along the Rail Corridor. 

Leveraging our experience and expertise in PPVC, Avenue South Residence will set a new world 

record for tallest reinforced concrete PPVC development, surpassing our own record for the two 

40-storey towers of The Clement Canopy, which was completed in March 2019. Through the PPVC 

method, we are able to provide a safer working environment for workers while reducing waste both  

on-site and off-site.

Avenue South Residence (artist’s impression) is directly connected to the Rail Corridor that allows residents to enjoy 

recreational activities.

At Pan Pacific Singapore, the Luggage Management System was launched to trace and retrieve guest 

bags easily using QR codes. The hotel also has two autonomous delivery robots to transport linen to 

the housekeeping stores. MIKA, its digital concierge, provides general information to guests, including 

in-room dining order requests. Going green is not at the expense of convenience when guests can do 

e-registration upon check-in and their invoices will be issued via email upon check-out. Guests also 

have access to PressReader, which gives them access to thousands of magazines and newspapers  

online from around the world.

PARKROYAL on Kitchener Road also embarked on digital transformation and job redesign efforts in 

early 2019. Most rooms have now been refurbished with built-in rollaway beds for quicker response 

time. Technologies such as the Luggage Management System and paperless check-in service were  

deployed. Self-service check-in kiosks will also be introduced by the third quarter of 2020. With the 

current downtime experienced by the hospitality sector due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the hotel 

accelerated its transformation and made use of the government’s job support scheme to raise the skills  

and capabilities of employees, and the quality of operations.

Improving Productivity and Enhancing Guest 

Experience Through Technology



In line with Singapore’s Smart Nation vision, PPHG partnered the government agencies to contribute 

to the digital transformation of the hotel industry. Technology will not only further drive productivity 

and enhance guest experience, but also free employees from time-consuming and repetitive tasks,  

so that they can pursue higher value-added jobs. 

Through the Tourism Innovation Challenge for Hotels programme launched by the Singapore Tourism 

Board (STB) and Singapore Hotel Association (SHA) in 2017, PPHG has since worked with participating 

solution providers to provide real-world environments to trial prototypes, with the potential to scale  

for wider industry adoption. PPHG also pledged to participate in the Hotel Job Redesign Initiative in 

2019 launched by Workforce Singapore in a tripartite collaboration with STB, SHA and NTUC affiliates,  

to enhance job satisfaction among employees.

PARKROYAL on Beach Road piloted a year-long centralised predictive maintenance solution, which 

leveraged technology for the chiller and energy readings to be collected in real time and transmitted  

to the cloud database. Daily tedious and manual checks by its engineering team are no longer needed, 

and paper used to record readings has reduced from about 350 pages per chiller per year to zero. 

Following the successful implementation, PARKROYAL on Beach Road and the solution were featured 

in STB’s Smart Hotel Technology Guide 2019, which helps hotels tap on data and smart technologies.  

The solution has since been rolled out to the rest of the Group’s hospitality properties in Singapore.

In 2019, the Group’s energy consumption and GHG emissions were 112,580 MWh and 46,828 tonnes of CO2 

equivalent respectively, which was a reduction of 2.1% compared with 2018. Building energy includes 

electricity consumption from the grid, cooling consumption, piped gas and diesel used on-site.

Given the nature of their operations, our hotels have the highest energy and water consumption, and are 

the largest contributor to the Group’s building energy and water consumption. Our hospitality business 

has been consistently implementing initiatives to improve operational and resource efficiency, such 

as through installing Building Management Systems and other energy- and water-saving equipment. 

We continue to seek opportunities to help us achieve our targets, through process strengthening, 

digitalisation and control, chiller optimisation and retrofitting.

In 2019, we revised our previous 2020 energy intensity target for commercial properties as they exceeded 

the target of a 16% reduction in energy intensity with 2010 as the base year in 2018. A new long-term  

target was set to achieve a 25% reduction by 2030 with 2010 as the base year. Our commercial properties 

achieved a 17.7% reduction of energy intensity by GFA occupied in 2019.

We also set a new long-term energy target for our hospitality business to achieve a 30% reduction of 

energy intensity by guest night by 2030 compared with the base year of 2013. Our hospitality business 

achieved a 26.5% reduction in 2019.

Given the different nature of our businesses, the normalisation factors used in our energy and water targets for our commercial 

properties and hotel operations are GFA occupied and guest nights respectively. The intensity data for the Group is reported on a by

ENVIRONMENT

As a leading property developer, integrating environmental considerations throughout our business, 

from design to construction and operation, is central to our long-term success. We also monitor the 

environmental performance of our properties and improve the efficiency of our owned buildings through 

ongoing maintenance and fit-out.

We reviewed and revised the 2030 water intensity target from 30% as reported in UOL Annual Report 2019 to 25% at the time of 

publication of this report.

The Group’s building water consumption was 904.3 thousand m3. Water used at all our properties is  

from municipal sources.

In 2019, we revised our previous 2020 water intensity targets for commercial properties and hospitality 

business as they exceeded their targets of 10% and 25% reductions by 2020 respectively in 2018.  

As such, we set new long-term targets for 2030.

In 2019, our commercial properties achieved a 14.9% reduction in water intensity by GFA occupied with

We had seven ongoing development projects in 2019: Amber45, Avenue South Residence, Botanique  

at Bartley, MEYER HOUSE, The Tre Ver, The Clement Canopy and Pan Pacific Orchard. 

In 2019, total energy consumed at our development projects was 41,536 GJ. Energy consumed mainly 

comes from electricity and diesel use. During the piling and structural stages of construction, main 

contractors rely on diesel for power generation and/or temporary power supply from SP PowerGrid for 

their electricity supply, as a permanent connection to the municipal supply has not yet been established.  

Five of our development projects were at those construction stages and this explained the increase 

in diesel and total energy consumption. As these projects progress over the next two years, energy 

consumption is expected to remain high.

Total GHG emissions was 3,210 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, with a breakdown of 2,847 tonnes and 363 

tonnes from Scope 1 and Scope 2 respectively. The GHG intensity by value of work completed was  

24.6 kg of CO2 equivalent per thousand dollars.

 

Total water consumption, which is from municipal sources, was 113.6 thousand m3 in 2019. We reduced 

water usage at our development projects by using wastewater from construction activities to wash 

trucks and other vehicles before they leave the construction sites, to minimise pollution to public  

road surfaces.

All our main contractors undertaking our projects in 2019 were certified to ISO 14001. They were also 

awarded the Green and Gracious Builder certification, with the exception of one main contractor 

that was a newly incorporated company. That main contractor targets to achieve the Green and  

Gracious Builder certification by the third quarter of 2020.

ENERGY CONSUMPTION FOR CORPORATE OFFICE

Our corporate office is located within one of our commercial properties. In 2019, our corporate office 

used 316.7 MWh of energy, a decrease from 331.3 MWh in 2018. GHG emissions also decreased by  

4.4% from 139 tonnes of CO2 in 2018 to 133 tonnes of CO2 in 2019. The decrease in energy consumed  

was due to efforts to enhance staff awareness of methods to conserve energy in the office.

WASTE AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

We report waste and recycling data for all our commercial properties, hotels and serviced suites.  

In 2019, the Group recorded 7,362 tonnes of waste disposed with a breakdown of 3,781 tonnes and 3,581  

tonnes from our commercial properties and hospitality business respectively. 

Our commercial properties and hospitality business had 370.4 tonnes and 72.7 tonnes of waste for 

recycling respectively. Notably, our hospitality business recorded a reduction of 14.3% waste recycled 

due to its initiative to eliminate all single-use plastic straws and plastic bottled water across its  

properties by the end of 2019, resulting in less single-use plastics being sent for recycling.

Our First Zero-Waste Hotel







Pan Pacific Orchard is slated to be the first zero-waste hotel in Singapore when it is targeted to open  

in 2021.

Designed by award-winning architectural firm WOHA, the 347-key hotel will be a showcase of 

environmental sustainability, offering rooms with eco-friendly features and three levels of experiential 

sky gardens that will redefine the vertical sky-rise typology. The foliage will cover more than 300%  

of the hotel’s land area. 

As a zero-waste hotel, Pan Pacific Orchard’s landscapes are designed to be self-sustaining and rely 

minimally on energy and water resources. Light, motion and rain sensors help regulate energy usage, 

while a rainwater harvesting system irrigates lower floors. Solar cells on the roof supplement the 

building’s energy usage and power the gardens, thus saving energy. Other sustainable features of the 

hotel include a food waste management system that transforms kitchen waste into nutrient water  

for gardens, and water dispensers that eliminate the need for plastic bottled water.

Additionally, the design of the terraces optimises natural daylight and facilitates cross ventilation,  

reducing overall dependency on energy usage and creating a unique urban resort ambience with natural 

light and fresh air. 

In January 2020, the hotel attained the BCA Green Mark Platinum, which is the highest rating in the 

certification standard.

We strive for zero health and safety incidents at all our development projects.

UOL tracks safety rates regularly at site meetings. As all main contractors are OHSAS 18001 or ISO 45001 

certified, they have in-house safety requirements. Every project site has appointed safety supervisors  

and personnel who conduct regular safety briefings and checks. 

In 2019, our contractors recorded one injury and a total of 69 lost days, including lost days carried over 

from an injury in 2018. We recorded a decrease in our accident frequency rate (AFR), from 0.8 in 2018 to 

0.5 in 2019. However, the accident severity rate (ASR) increased from 17.0 in 2018 to 31.7 in 2019, due to a 

reduction in man-hours worked in 2019 that resulted in the impact of the lost days from injuries being more 

pronounced. Man-hours worked are dependent on the stages that development projects are in. As two 

projects were in the final construction stage and five others were in the piling and structural stages where  

manpower needs are low, man-hours worked in 2019 were substantially (58%) less compared with 2018.

FOOD SAFETY &amp; HYGIENE 

For our hospitality business, food safety is a fundamental priority in ensuring the well-being of our 

guests. 

We have a comprehensive Food Safety Management System (FSMS), which includes extensive food 

safety training along with external audits along the entire food chain, from receipt of raw produce, 

preparation to delivery. The FSMS serves to enhance our existing procedures and helps cultivate  

best-practice in our food safety culture. 

Our hotels maintained our track record for food safety. A marginal number of cases were reported and 

thoroughly investigated with laboratory tests, where possible. No indications of contamination were

Our people are our greatest asset. We employed 1,777 people in Singapore in 2019; the vast majority  

(over 90%) are employed in the hospitality business. Our turnover rates for the property and hospitality 

businesses remain well below the respective national industry averages every year. The turnover rate  

of the property business increased slightly from 13.3% in 2018 to 16.9% in 2019, while the turnover rate of  

the hospitality business decreased from 32.1% in 2018 to 27.4% in 2019. 

The Group recorded an absentee rate of 3.6% in 2019 (2.8% in 2018), or roughly an average of 8.2 days of  

sick leave per employee, based on a five-day work week. The absentee rate of our property business was 

2.5% while that of our hospitality business was 4%.

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

We believe a diverse work environment will enrich our perspectives and attract high-calibre candidates 

from the widest talent pool. Our workforce consists of 16 nationalities across the Group. 

We value gender diversity and believe we have a responsibility to contribute to a fair and productive 

society. We ensure commitment towards equal opportunities at all levels of the organisation. In 

our property business, 46% of Senior Management were female compared with 40% in 2018. In our  

hospitality business, 43% of Senior Management of our various business units were female compared 

with 48% in 2018.

We also recognise that our employees have family responsibilities. We seek to foster a supportive 

environment for employees with children and dependents. We offer paternity leave to working  

fathers whose children are not Singapore citizens, even though paternity leave is only applicable  

to employees whose children are Singapore citizens, under the Ministry of Manpower’s regulation. 

We recognise retiring employees as assets to our organisation and promote the redeployment  

of mature workers into the business. As at end December 2019, 20.1% of employees in our property 

business and 21.0% of employees in our hospitality business were above the age of 50. 

We believe in leveraging and developing the skills of the people in our local communities. In 2019, 

Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents constituted 96.2% of Senior Management and 97.7% 

of other employees in our property business, and 88.2% of Senior Management and 58.6% of other 

employees in our hospitality business. We continue to align ourselves with Singapore’s national targets 

on diversity and inclusion in our workforce.

For our hospitality business, the average training hours per employee was 56.7 hours, compared

Group

As a responsible business, we see it as part of our duty to give back to the society in which we operate. 

We focus our community efforts on children, youth, education, sports and the arts. Our community 

initiatives include donations, in-kind donations and staff volunteerism to deliver meaningful impact.  

Not only do these initiatives help the local community, but they also help our employees engage and 

benefit personally from helping others. 

In 2019, UOL established the UOL Group - SUTD Scholarship in 2019 with the Singapore University 

of Technology and Design (SUTD) to support the Architecture and Sustainable Design degree  

programme. We also helped needy SUTD students through bursaries.

Since 2017, UOL has been sponsoring a therapy horse at Riding for the Disabled Association of Singapore 

to help people with physical and mental disabilities. In 2019, we extended our support by sponsoring a 

group of children with special needs for their riding therapy.

Besides supporting the disadvantaged financially, we encourage our employees to volunteer their  

time to help the less fortunate. During the year, employees participated in three staff volunteering  

activities with beneficiaries from Care Corner Student Care Centre, National Library Board’s kidsREAD 

programme and AWWA Senior Community Home. 

UOL has been a long-term supporter of the arts. Since 2014, we have been supporting Very Special 

Arts (VSA), which seeks to create and provide access and opportunities for people with disabilities 

through the arts. We regularly purchase paintings from the VSA artist community for display at our 

residential showflats and condominiums. We also provide opportunities for VSA artists to put up their 

works for sale whenever possible. In 2019, PPHG sponsored the venue for a series of art exhibitions 

held by VSA at Pan Pacific Singapore. PPHG also published “The Art of the Journey”, an art book 

which brings together 170 pieces of artwork by 85 artists, including works from Singapore’s Cultural  

Medallion recipients.

In addition to continuing our five-year sponsorship of a marble sculpture at Gardens by the Bay 

that began in 2018, we forged a new partnership with the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) to support 

its Saturdays@ACM and Weekend with ACM programmes. Under this programme, family-friendly  

activities will be held at ACM and UOL premises for three years. For giving towards heritage causes 

like this, UOL will be receiving the Patron of Heritage Awards 2019 by the National Heritage Board  

in 2020. We also received the Friend of the Arts Award at the Patron of the Arts Awards 2019 presented  

by the National Arts Council, in recognition of our support for the local arts scene. 

PPHG also continued its Eat Well With Us (EWWU) programme launched in 2015 in partnership with 

the National Council of Social Service. In 2019, senior chefs from PPHG held 10 hands-on culinary  

sessions to impart skills and recipes to cooks from Social Service Agencies (SSAs) in Singapore, 

enabling them to create healthier and tastier meals for their residents. In 2019, EWWU benefitted  

more than 4,000 residents in 20 SSAs.

Appreciation to Healthcare Workers

Our Commitment to Stakeholders During COVID-19

Our two malls, United Square and Velocity@Novena Square, are located near Health City Novena, where 

healthcare professionals are working hard in taking care of patients who are infected by COVID-19. 

As a gesture of appreciation towards their effort and dedication during this challenging period, UOL 

launched a Healthcare Appreciative Package for 1,000 healthcare professionals. Each healthcare 

professional received $40 worth of shopping and dining vouchers for redemption at the participating  

mall outlets.

The COVID-19 outbreak has widespread impact on the global and local economy. During this challenging  

time when businesses are affected, the Group remains committed to supporting our affected 

stakeholders.

With the retail sector being one of the hardest hit, UOL rolled out rental waivers, inclusive of full property 

tax rebates, to our retail tenants from March to July 2020. The Group also executed a comprehensive 

range of precautionary measures across our commercial properties. These included stepping up the 

frequency of cleaning of public areas, temperature screening, contact tracing and implementation  

of safe-distancing measures.

As the hospitality sector is also facing a downtime, our hotel subsidiary PPHG made use of the opportunity 

to send the employees for training to raise their skills and capabilities. This demonstrates our continual 

commitment to our employees to invest in training, so as to help them develop personally, and raise the 

quality of our hotel operations.

The Group has been following the government guidelines to ensure good hygiene and health standards 

for the well-being of our employees, tenants, visitors, shoppers and hotel guests. Social distancing 

measures, temperature checks, health and travel declarations, and frequent disinfection of buildings 

are being carried out. The Group has also implemented team segregation, staggered work timings and 

work-from-home arrangements for employees where necessary. Employees are also engaged and 

updated on the evolving situation and measures carried out by the Group.



Frequent cleaning and disinfection are carried out for the well-being 

of our building occupants.

Separation markers for social distancing were put in place in UOL’s 

premises.



Promoting Heritage and Culture Through 

Partnership with ACM



On 10 November 2019, Velocity@Novena Square attracted more than 8,000 people who had turned up to  

try their hand at Chinese ink painting at INKspired, a fringe event organised by ACM held in conjunction  

with its special exhibition on Chinese art held at the museum. 

A large colourful wall painting formed the main backdrop of the activity booth. Mr Raymond Lau, an 

established and award-winning local artist, had created an outline with black ink to allow visitors 

to contribute their own interpretations of a landscape painting. Visitors also had fun dressing up as  

Chinese scholars, painting scholar figurines and carving rubber seals. 

UOL sponsored the venue for INKspired as part of the three-year partnership that we have with ACM 

to support Saturdays@ACM and Weekends with ACM, a family-friendly programme held at ACM 

and UOL premises. With our malls as a community space, people can access culture and arts easily.  

ACM can also reach out to more people through fringe events held at our malls. 

“We thank UOL for its support that will allow ACM to continue its efforts in formulating educational 

programmes fit for all ages to connect more closely with culture and the arts,” said Mr Kennie Ting, 

Director, Asian Civilisations Museum &amp; The Peranakan Museum.

Local artist Raymond Lau (in pink) was delighted to see how children added their own creativity 

to the landscape painting such as drawing dragons around the mountain and rainbow in the sky.

APPENDIX B: NOTES FOR SUSTAINABILITY 

PERFORMANCE DATA

GENERAL

1. 

Buildings 

 

Mixed Developments: Novena Square and United Square

 

Offices: Faber House and Odeon Towers

 

Retail: KINEX

 

Hotels: PARKROYAL on Beach Road, PARKROYAL on Kitchener Road, PARKROYAL COLLECTION 

Pickering (former PARKROYAL on Pickering), and Pan Pacific Singapore. Pan Pacific Orchard  

was excluded as it closed for redevelopment on 1 April 2018.

 

Serviced Suites: PARKROYAL Serviced Suites Beach Road, Pan Pacific Serviced Suites Beach  

Road, and Pan Pacific Serviced Suites Orchard.

2. 

Development projects: Refers to construction and redevelopment activities that took place in 

Singapore, including joint ventures with UIC. 

3. 

Corporate office: Refers to electricity consumption at UOL’s corporate office, based on utility 

bills. Water data is unavailable, as water is not separately metered. Our corporate office sits within  

United Square and forms a subset of the building energy and water figures reported.

ENVIRONMENT

4. 

Coverage within building: Data from tenants is excluded for Mixed Developments, Offices and 

Retail properties. Energy data reported for Hotels and Serviced Suites includes areas owned  

and  managed by PPHG, except for Pan Pacific Singapore where data includes retail and F&amp;B tenants.

5. 

District Cooling: The BCA Energy Benchmarking Report excludes properties with district cooling, 

which can form a significant part of the energy consumption. One of our hotels, Pan Pacific  

Singapore, uses district cooling technology.

6. 

GFA and GFA occupied: We report our energy, GHG emissions, water, and waste intensity figures  

by GFA and GFA occupied.

 

We adopt BCA’s definition for GFA. All covered floor areas of a building, except otherwise exempted, 

uncovered areas for commercial uses, are deemed the GFA of the building. Generally, car parks  

are excluded from GFA computation.

 

GFA occupied is calculated by occupancy rate (simple average of monthly occupancy rates)  

multiplied by GFA. 

 

Occupancy rate for PARKROYAL on Kitchener Road in 2019 is calculated based on available rooms 

as the denominator. This denominator decreased from 2018 as the hotel is undergoing renovation,  

thus reducing the number of available rooms. 

 

Odeon Towers has a reduced GFA from 23,273 m2 to 23,236 m2 (reduced by 37 m2 or 0.2%) effective 

1 July 2015. We recognise this change in our reporting from 2016 onwards.

 

The GFA for PARKROYAL Serviced Suites Singapore was updated in 2018 to reflect improved data. 

The new GFA was applied to historical years (where relevant).

7. 

Guest night: We adopt the definition from EarthCheck, a leading tourism benchmarking group. 

Guest night includes i) guests/staff staying overnight, ii) day/banquet guests and iii) non-resident  

restaurant guests, as illustrated in the equation below:

 

Guest night = Overnight guests/staff + (Day/banquet guests ÷ 3) + (Non-resident restaurant guests  

÷ 4)

 

i)  Guests/staff staying overnight: The number of guests staying overnight equals the number  

 

people staying over each night (including complimentary stays and staff that live on-site),  

 

added up over the year.

 

Example: Two people sharing a room for three nights is equal to 6 guest nights (2 x 3)

 

 

ii) Day guests: Day guests represent the number of non-resident day guests (for example,  

 

the number of people turning up to use on-site facilities such as a spa, golf course, MICE or  

 

business centre, but do not stay overnight) added up over the year.

 

 

Day guests would also include delegates attending day conferences and/or functions. Please  

 

note that ‘Day guests’ does not include restaurant covers.

 

 

Example: Over the year, a hotel’s fitness centre received an additional 3,750 non-resident users.  

 

This would be equivalent to 1,250 guest nights (3,750 ÷ 3).

 

iii) Non-resident restaurant guests: Non-resident restaurant guests represent the number of  

 

non-resident day guests (for example, the number of people turning up to dine at F&amp;B outlets/ 

 

restaurants, but do not stay overnight) added up over the benchmarking period (typically  

 

365 days).

 

 

Example: Over the year, a hotel’s restaurants/F&amp;B outlets received an additional 2,000  

 

non-resident restaurant users. This would be equivalent to 500 guest nights (2,000 ÷ 4).

8. 

Building and development site details including property type, area and occupancy rates are  

available in UOL Annual Report 2019’s Property Summary, pages 68-75.

9. 

GHG conversion is based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Emission factors for electricity  

generation are sourced from the Energy Market Authority (EMA), 2019. Electricity Grid 

Emission Factor for 2018 was updated from EMA. Due to this, past year emission data for 2018 

was restated based on figures from EMA, which had a slight (&lt;1%) difference from figures 

used previously. Greenhouse Gas Protocol Emission Factors from Cross Sector Tools, March 

2017 were used for diesel conversions. The Global Warming Potential of CH4 and N2O is not  

considered because its effect on the overall emissions is insignificant.

U O L  S U S T A I N A B I L I T Y  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9

52


10. Source of conversion factor from diesel in litres to kWh is the Carbon Disclosure Project. Technical 

Note. Conversion of fuel data to MWh, 2016. 

11. Waste data for Mixed Developments, Offices and Retail properties include all users of the buildings.

 

Waste recycled for United Square in 2Q, 3Q and 4Q 2019 was computed on the basis of estimation 

as the vendor that provided paper recycling services to United Square from May to October 2019  

did not provide any invoices.

12. Waste data for Hotels and Serviced Suites includes guests, but excludes retail and F&amp;B tenants, 

except for PARKROYAL on Beach Road, where waste data includes disposal from PARKROYAL 

Serviced Suites Singapore and tenants at The Plaza, as these properties share the same disposal 

receptacle.

13. Waste intensity formula excludes waste recycled. Waste intensity for hospitality is derived by  

total number of guest nights for simplicity.

HEALTH AND SAFETY

14.  Workplace health and safety data include development projects and hospitality. 

 

Coverage for development projects: Workplace accidents involving main contractors and  

sub-contractors.

 

Coverage for hospitality: Workplace accidents involving all employees and contractors at hotels and 

serviced suites.

15.  Accident frequency rate is defined as the number of workplace accidents for every one million  

man-hours worked.

16.  Number of man-hours worked in safety data reported:

 

Development projects: The number of man-hours includes main contractors’ and sub-contractors’ 

hours. 

 

Hospitality: The number of man-hours includes employees’ and contractors’ hours.

17.  Workplace accidents must be reported to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) if the accident results in 

hospitalisation for 24 hours or more or medical leave for three days, whether consecutive or not. 

Fatalities as a result of work must also be reported to MOM. 

18.  The new standard ISO 45001 will replace OHSAS 18001. Companies must migrate to the new 

standard by March 2021. Two main contractors for development projects were certified to the  

new ISO 45001 standard in 2019. 

PEOPLE

19.  While UOL Management Services (UMS) is a wholly-owned subsidiary, the working relationship 

is such that UMS is considered to be a contractor supplying facility management services to 

UOL. As such, figures reported for our property business exclude UMS as employees and instead  

report figures relating to UMS under contractors, where applicable.

20.  There are no significant variations in the total number of employees for both our property and 

hospitality businesses.

21.  Scheduled workdays is calculated by 5 days x 52 weeks minus actual public holidays, actual annual 

leave and actual parental leave.

22.  A significant portion of the property development business is performed by our contractors during 

construction. Facilities management services are provided by UMS.   

23.  Training figures for 2015 do not include the corporate office of our hospitality business. These 

figures are provided in 2016 and onwards.

24.  Average training hours per employee = Total training hours for the year / Number of employees as  

at 31 December. 

25.  The definition of Senior Management is ‘Assistant General Manager and above’ for the property 

business, whereas for the hospitality business, it is ‘Vice President and above, Executive Committee 

Member and Head of Department’.

COMMUNITY

26. We track our community contributions internally and currently do not report on it externally, 

as this report is focused on our key material topics.

COMPLIANCE

27.  Scope of number of significant fines or non-monetary sanctions includes:

 

• Non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

 

• Incidents of non-compliance concerning the health and safety impacts of products and services.

 

• Substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy and losses of customer data.

 

• Non-compliance with laws and regulations in the social and economic areas.

INDEPENDENT LIMITED ASSURANCE REPORT

To the Directors of UOL Group Limited

CONCLUSION

We were engaged by the Board of Directors of UOL Group Limited (the Group) to provide limited 

assurance on the accompanying UOL Sustainability Report 2019 for the year ended 31 December 2019 

(the Report), and the selected Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards disclosures  

(Selected GRI Disclosures) as identified below.

Based on the evidence we obtained from the procedures performed as described in the Auditors’ 

Responsibilities section of our report, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that:

(a) the Report has not described the sustainability practices on a comply-or-explain basis with  

 

reference to the following components as listed under Rule 711B of the Singapore Exchange’s (SGX)  

 

Listing Manual;

• Material environmental, social and governance factors;

• Policies, practices and performance;

• Targets*;

• Sustainability reporting framework; and

• Board statement; and

 

* With the exception of certain environmental and market presence factors, for which targets for the forthcoming  

 

year have not been set due to uncertainties attributed to COVID-19.

(b) the Selected GRI Disclosures as identified in the table below, are not calculated, in all material  

 

respects, in accordance with the relevant topic-specific disclosures requirements in the GRI  

 

Standards: Core Option.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSION

We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with Singapore Standard on Assurance 

Engagements 3000 Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 

Information (SSAE 3000). Our responsibilities are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities 

section of our report.  

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Accounting and 

Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants 

and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity,  

objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.

Our firm applies Singapore Standard on Quality Control 1 and, accordingly, maintains a comprehensive  

system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with 

ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT

Management is responsible for: 

• 

preparing and presenting the Report in accordance with the GRI Standards and Rule 711B of the  

SGX Listing Manual, and the information and assertions contained within it; 

• 

determining UOL’s objectives in respect of sustainable development performance and reporting, 

including the identification of stakeholders and material issues; 

• 

establishing and maintaining appropriate internal control systems that enable the preparation 

and presentation of the Report and the selected GRI disclosures that are free from material 

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; 

• 

preventing and detecting fraud and for identifying and ensuring that the Group complies with  

laws and regulations applicable to its activities; and

• 

ensuring that staff involved with the preparation and presentation of the Report are properly 

trained, information systems are properly updated and that any changes in reporting encompass  

all significant reporting units.

AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES

Our responsibility is to carry out a limited assurance engagement in accordance with SSAE 3000 and to 

express a conclusion based on the work performed. SSAE 3000 requires that we plan and perform the  

engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Report is free from material misstatement. 

The extent of our work performed depends on our professional judgement and our assessment of the 

engagement risk. 

A limited assurance engagement consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for 

the preparation of information presented in the Report, and applying analytical and other evidence  

gathering procedures, as appropriate. These procedures included:

• 

inquiries of management to gain an understanding of UOL’s processes for determining the material 

issues for UOL’s key stakeholder groups;

• 

interviews with senior management and relevant staff at the corporate and selected business unit 

level concerning sustainability strategy and policies for material issues, and the implementation  

of these across the business; 

• 

interviews with relevant staff at the corporate and business unit level responsible for providing the 

information in the Report;

• 

inquiries of the design and implementation of the systems and methods used to collect and report 

on the GRI Disclosures, including the aggregation of the reported information;

• 

comparison of the GRI Disclosures presented in the Report to corresponding information in the 

relevant underlying sources to determine whether all the relevant information contained in such 

underlying sources has been appropriately included in the GRI Disclosures; and

• 

reading the information presented in the Report to determine whether it is in line with our overall 

knowledge of, and experience with, the sustainability performance of the Group.

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and  

are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance 

obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have 

been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.

Due to the inherent limitations of any internal control structure it is possible that errors or irregularities 

in the information presented in the Report may occur and not be detected. Our engagement is not 

designed to detect all weaknesses in the internal controls over the preparation and presentation of 

the Report, as the engagement has not been performed continuously throughout the period and the  

procedures performed were undertaken on a test basis.

RESTRICTION ON USE

This report has been prepared for the Directors of UOL Group Limited for the purpose of providing an 

assurance conclusion on the Report and Selected GRI Disclosures and may not be suitable for another 

purpose. We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this report, to any person other 

than the Directors of UOL Group Limited, or for any other purpose than that for which it was prepared.
