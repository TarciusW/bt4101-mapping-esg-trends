DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

On behalf of the Board and management of YHI International Limited (“YHI” or the 

“Group”), I present our third annual sustainability report (the “report”). This report 

compiles our sustainability strategy and initiatives as we continue to evolve and 

improve on our sustainability journey. At YHI, we want to contribute towards making a 

difference to issues that matter most to our business and to the world. 

2019 was Singapore’s Year of Zero Waste, an issue we are keenly aware of at YHI. 

Our manufacturing operations produce waste, so we continuously strive to reduce 

the amount of virgin materials that we require, increase the amount of waste that 

is recycled, and ultimately, reduce our contribution to landfills. Through our Kaizen 

initiatives, our various subsidiaries re-evaluate the status quo and innovate to find new 

ways of reducing wastage and improve efficiency. 

AT YHI, the Board oversees the Group’s sustainability performance, practices and 

initiatives and its compliance with SGX guidelines on corporate governance and 

sustainability reporting. It has played a key role in determining and re-evaluating the 

material environmental, social and governance factors examined in this report, and 

considers sustainability an important part of our strategy formulation. As a listed 

company, YHI is committed to the Code of Corporate Governance of Singapore, 

which provides an important framework for controls and checks that help the Board 

govern with transparency and integrity. 

It bears mentioning that at the time of this report, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread 

across the globe. The pandemic has had devastating effects on many lives, both 

from a health perspective and from a livelihood perspective. Economies have slowed 

down, supply chains have been disrupted, many businesses have come to a grinding 

halt. Although the full effects of the COVID-19 pandemic likely won’t be known for 

some time to come, it has prompted a re-evaluation of values and priorities for many 

governments, businesses and individuals. At YHI, the pandemic has reinforced our 

belief in the importance of thinking long-term and making decisions that protect our 

stakeholders, including our shareholders, employees and customers. We are keeping 

a close eye on the situation and are shaping our decision-making accordingly. 

We hope this report will provide our stakeholders with valuable insights on our 

sustainability efforts.

CHAIRMAN’S

MESSAGE


This is the third sustainability report published by YHI International Limited, providing an update of the Group’s sustainability 

performance for the year ended 31st December 2019. This report has been prepared with reference to the Global Reporting 

Initiative (“GRI”) Standards. For this, we sought guidance from external consultants who advised us on relevant reporting 

requirements set out in the GRI Standards as well as in the SGX guidelines.

This report covers our five major distribution subsidiaries in Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand, and all three 

factories in Malaysia, China and Taiwan. The eight subsidiaries which form the reporting boundary for this report are provided 

in Exhibit 1 below:

OUR COMMITMENT

As a corporate business, it is our responsibility to continuously create and achieve greater economic value for our shareholders, 

and we aim to operate in such a way that the economy and society also benefit from our business activities. We also believe 

that this value creation journey can never be a zero-sum game, as it can only be sustainable for the present and our future 

generations if the well-being and development of the environment, society and people are not unfairly compromised and the 

resources used for our activities are not irresponsibly depleted or wasted. To ensure sustainability, there is no better way than 

the consistent monitoring of resource input and output of our commercial activities and the proper balancing of respective 

stakeholders’ interests. 

We firmly believe in recognising our responsibility to the environment, society at large, the market, as well as our employees. We 

have been incorporating and managing sustainability as part of our corporate policies, business strategy and risk management 

practice over the years. From our experiences, we have learned that with proper planning and implementation, our business 

practices can simultaneously maximise economic value creation and also achieve sustainability objectives. 

When the opportunity arises, our employees strive to support the local community. For example: 

• 

YHI Singapore was a gold sponsor of The Singapore Island Country Club May 

Day Charity Golf 2019. The funds raised were used to help various charitable 

organisations and underserved communities in Singapore. 

• 

YHI New Zealand organises blood donation drives regularly and allows employees to 

take paid volunteering leave to participate in community service activities.  In 2019, 

YHI New Zealand organised a donation drive to support the victims and families of 

the tragic Christchurch mosque shootings. 

• 

YHI New Zealand is also a platinum sponsor for Totara Park Riding for the Disabled, 

an Auckland-based charity bringing differently-abled individuals to interact with 

horses. The activities help improve physical ability, independence and self-worth for 

children and adult with physical, intellectual, emotional and social challenges. 

The COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping through the planet at the time of this report’s preparation. The pandemic has caused 

unprecedented damage to global communities. High rates of spread and mortality, economic disruption through the halting 

of business activity across entire value chains has placed great strain on many economies and individuals. While it is unclear 

when the pandemic will end and how extensive its impact will be, the pandemic has prompted much reflection on prevailing 

values and actions. YHI is vividly reminded of the importance of being a responsible business for its stakeholders, namely 

customers, principals/suppliers, employees and shareholders, as YHI’s actions and business sustainability will have direct 

impact on their economic and social wellbeing. 

OUR REPORTING APPROACH

We adopted a phased approach in preparing and publishing our sustainability reports:

• 

In our first sustainability report we provided an overview of the identified material ESG factors, how we are addressing 

these factors, and data on our performance.

• 

In our second and third sustainability report, we reported on our material ESG factors, tracked performance progress 

and set future targets for the material ESG factors. 

GOVERNANCE OVER SUSTAINABILITY MATTERS

Our Board of Directors oversees YHI Group’s sustainability matters. The Board is supported by YHI’s Enterprise Risk 

Management Executive Committee, which comprises members from senior management and is headed by the Executive 

Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. On behalf of the Committee, the Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer report 

to the Board of Directors on all matters concerning sustainability.

YHI INTERNATIONAL LIMITED   SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019



As one of our key corporate policies, for many years, we have embraced the Japanese business philosophy and practice of 

“Kaizen”, which can be translated as “improvement”. To stay competitive, our subsidiaries are aware of the importance of 

continually reviewing their existing business and operational practices to identify areas for improvement. Improvements can 

be delivered through innovation, enhancing productivity or reducing waste. In addition to Kaizen, our “3R” policy of reducing 

stock-holding, accounts receivables and operating costs also assists us in minimising resource consumption and waste. 

ENERGY CONSUMPTION &amp; EMISSIONS

We consume a significant amount of energy to manufacture and distribute our products. Our distribution subsidiaries’ offices 

and warehouses primarily consume electricity, whereas our factories rely on both electricity and natural gas.

Our energy consumption level is generally aligned with our business activities. For example, an increase or decrease in the 

storage and shipment of goods, or an increase or decrease in the production level has a direct impact on the distribution 

segment or our factories’ energy consumption. However, there are other factors that also affect energy consumption such as 

the use of more energy-saving equipment or lighting or factories producing more energy or resource intensive products. 

YHI consistently strives to increase efficiency and minimise energy consumption.   

Over the years, we have implemented various energy efficiency and energy conservation policies and guidance for both 

business segments. For example:

• 

For factories, energy consumption is closely monitored and systematically assessed for potential savings. Where 

feasible, we undertake energy saving initiatives. One good example is the Suzhou factory’s in-house innovation under 

the Kaizen initiative of channelling the waste heat discharged from air compressors of the casting department to the 

painting department to heat up the water used for alloy wheel washing. The recovery and innovative use of waste heat 

in the painting department has led to a significant decrease in the amount of natural gas consumption and reduction in 

associated emissions. 

• 

For warehouses and offices, we have a clear policy that we should turn off lights and air-conditioners while not in use. 

Where feasible, we will opt for individual workspace lighting instead of centralised lighting in order to conserve energy. 

Energy-saving LED lighting or light control switch and motion sensors have also been installed so as to reduce the energy 

consumption level.  

The total energy consumed by the five major distribution subsidiaries and the three factories in 2019 is provided in Table 1. 

The scope 2 emissions associated with our electricity consumption is also provided.

For 2019 as compared with previous years:

• 

The five major distribution subsidiaries recorded a lower level of electricity consumption largely due to the installation of 

energy-saving LED lighting and motion sensors in some of our major warehouses. 

• 

The factories recorded increase in electricity consumption due to an increase of energy intensive production activities 

based on customer specifications.

EFFLUENTS &amp; WASTE MANAGEMENT AND REDUCTION

At Manufacturing Segment

Our factories produce wastewater and waste materials during the manufacturing process. The waste materials primarily 

include aluminium dross, sludge, paint waste, waste coolant and non-reusable packaging materials. While our factories’ 

level of effluents and waste discharge or disposal is aligned with production activities, other influential factors include varying 

product design requirements and the discharge or disposal quota imposed by the local regulators.  

We endeavour to minimise water and resource consumption at our factories to reduce effluent and waste output and continue 

to practise recycling and/or reuse where feasible. For example: 

• 

Both Suzhou and Malacca factory practise water recycling and reuse: 

 

- 

As the amount of wastewater discharge is limited by the discharge quota imposed by local authority, Suzhou 

factory strives to maximise its recycling and reuse of wastewater through water treatment. If wastewater discharge 

is needed, Suzhou factory will adhere to the discharge quota and the pollution limits (such as the level of chemical 

oxygen demand contained in the wastewater) set by the authority.

 

- 

There is no wastewater discharge at Malacca factory as wastewater produced will be chemically treated for 

recycling and reuse.

• 

All factories closely monitor the amount of aluminium consumed and the amount of production scraps produced. Excess 

aluminium trimmed off during alloy wheel moulding and refining process is put together and evaluated for possible reuse. 

Packaging waste is minimised through efficient consumption of packaging materials. 

• 

Wood or plastic pallets for factory and warehouse storage use are purchased in accordance with forecasted usage. 

Pallets are reused until damaged beyond repair. Some factories also recycle their scrap metals by giving the scraps to 

external contractors to weld and build into storage racks and shelves for reuse.





(Above) Furniture and garden trellis hand built by factory workers in Malacca and Suzhou using damaged wooden pallets.

Non-recyclable or reusable effluents and waste are discharged and disposed of in accordance with local regulations. For 

example: 

• 

If wastewater discharge is required, Suzhou factory will discharge the water to an external wastewater treatment plant 

designated by the local authority in compliance with the discharge quota and the pollutant limits imposed; whereas, 

Taiwan factory’s wastewater is chemically treated in accordance with local regulations before being discharged to public 

sewer.

• 

Waste materials are disposed of by factories to waste disposal collectors in compliance with the respective local 

regulations. Similarly, damaged tyres and batteries are also disposed of by the distribution business to waste disposal 

collectors in compliance with local regulations.

Table 2 provides the aggregate  water discharge by quality and destination for the three factories between 2017 and 2019. 

Table 3 provides the aggregate amount of waste disposal by type and disposal method for the factories between 2017 and 

2019.

For 2019 as compared with previous years:

• 

The amount of wastewater discharged by Suzhou factory in 2019 was same as last year in compliance with the discharge 

quota imposed by local authority. Wastewater not discharged was treated and reused in the factory; whereas, the decline 

in the amount of chemically treated water discharged by Taiwan factory was primarily due to the factory’s adoption of 

new water treatment equipment and method.

• 

The factories had recorded reduced amount of hazardous and non-hazardous waste primarily due to their continual 

control of material planning and consumption and prompt actions taken to reuse or recycle certain materials.

There were no incidents of non-compliance with the relevant water discharge or hazardous waste handling regulations between 

2017 and 2019. YHI aims to maintain zero incidents of non-compliance in 2020.

At Distribution Segment 

The waste produced at our distribution subsidiaries primarily includes damaged tyres and batteries. We do not find the amount 

of wastewater produced to be material for this reporting period.  

Our damaged tyres and batteries are disposed of by our distribution subsidiaries to waste collectors. Given the varying disposal 

and measurement methods based on relevant local regulations, we encountered difficulties in standardising and consolidating 

the disposal data and have not provided this data in this report. We aim to improve our data collection and consolidation 

methods and report the relevant information in our future reporting. From 2017 to 2019, there were no incidents of non-

compliance with the relevant hazardous waste handling regulations. YHI aims to maintain zero incidents of non-compliance in 

2020.

EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT

Our employees are key to the success of our business. Without them, we would have been unable to achieve the business 

growth we have experienced. It is stated in our corporate mission that we treat our employees with care, consideration, respect 

and provide them with the growth opportunities they seek in order to have long, successful careers at YHI. The core values of 

YHI also specifically promote “teamwork”, “mutual respect”, “integrity &amp; honesty”, “quality of work” and “commitment”.

At YHI, we are committed to providing equal job opportunities in the countries we operate in, regardless of gender, age and 

race. We are also committed to recruiting locals or residents to run and manage the operations in our overseas subsidiaries. As 

a global distributor with business operations in various countries, we believe that it is important for us to be an open-minded, 

fair and responsible employer.

We also place emphasis on fair and equal remuneration and employee development to improve their employability. We believe 

these measures help us attract and retain our talent pool and prepare them for leadership roles. We also regularly benchmark 

against industry peers to monitor and improve our employee remuneration and benefit packages. 

We promote work-life balance for our employees and encourage them to organise a variety of activities such as holiday trips 

and festive gatherings. The activities are open to all employees and subsidized by YHI. Some of the activities such as family 

days are also open to the employees’ children.  

All our subsidiaries are encouraged to conduct annual employee satisfaction surveys and review the results to identify areas for 

improvement. It is YHI’s goal that by 2021 the employee satisfaction survey and review will become a routine annual exercise 

for all subsidiaries.

For 2019 as compared with previous years:

• 

For distribution business, the hiring and turnover was aligned with respective distribution subsidiaries’ sales revenue and 

business forecasts.

• 

For factories, the hiring and turnover of production workers was aligned with the industry norms in respective countries, 

labour supply conditions and business forecasts.  

EMPLOYEE TRAINING AND EDUCATION

To stay competitive, it is important to ensure that our employees are adequately trained and equipped with the knowledge and 

skills required by their roles. Our subsidiaries’ management teams are tasked with identifying employee training needs and 

training schedules in accordance with operational and business development plans.

For both the distribution and manufacturing businesses, training topics provided to employees include product and quality 

knowledge, machine operations, relevant ISO standards, workplace health &amp; safety policies, sales and management skills, 

self-development skills, information technology, relevant financial reporting standards and tax regulations. The trainings are 

either delivered by in-house personnel or external trainers. Certain job functions in both the distribution and manufacturing 

businesses also require supervised on-the-job training.

The average hours of training per employee from 2017 to 2019 is provided in Table 5. There were no significant changes in 

the average hours of training per employee between 2018 and 2019 for both distribution subsidiaries and factories. Using 

2018 as the base year, YHI aims to increase the annual average hours of training for each employee by at least 20% by 2021.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

We would not be able to fulfil our business obligations to customers without the hard work and dedication of our employees. 

We are conscious of our employees’ wellbeing and work to ensure their safety at all times. Management teams of respective 

subsidiaries are also required to ensure compliance with relevant local workplace health and safety regulations. 

While the specific policies developed by subsidiaries may vary in accordance with local work environment and regulations, 

all such policies entail workplace risks and hazard identification and the formulation  of effective measures to minimise them. 

There were zero incidents of work-related fatalities between 2017 and 2019. YHI aims to maintain zero work-related fatalities 

in 2020. The aggregate number of work-related injuries and lost days for the five major distribution subsidiaries and the three 

factories from 2017 to 2019 is provided in Table 6.

Breakdown not provided in 2017 sustainability report

For 2019 as compared with previous years:

• 

For the distribution business, the number of injury cases reported is the same as in 2018, with fewer severe injuries 

resulting in fewer lost days.  

• 

For the manufacturing business, there was an increase in the number of injury cases and lost days reported. The 

factories have investigated the injury cases and strengthened the preventative measures at workplace and reminded the 

employees to observe workplace safety and exercise care at all times.

Lessons from the work-related accidents are shared across YHI to prevent recurrence and we will continuously work towards 

reducing the occurrence of workplace accidents.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

As a corporate business, we are committed to deliver stable and sustainable economic growth for the business and financial 

returns for the shareholders. 

2019 brought many challenges given an unconducive political atmosphere. Export and manufacturing-led regional economies 

were impacted by the China-USA trade war and the downturn in the electronics sector. To mitigate the difficult operating 

environment, YHI adhered strictly to the tried and tested strategy of keeping a strong balance sheet while seeking opportunities 

to expand revenue streams. Through cost, inventory and receivables management in tandem with our marketing strategy of 

extending the depth, breath and reach of products, we have been able to ensure our businesses remained robust, efficient 

and on course for long-term growth.

ANTI-CORRUPTION AND ANTI-COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOUR

We are proud of our progress from our humble beginnings because we have maintained honour and integrity 

at every step of the way. We strongly believe in our corporate values and constantly strive to uphold them in all 

business decisions and through our operations. If we were to violate them, we would risk losing the trust of our 

stakeholders. 

 

Employees are given Code of Conduct handbooks upon joining. As supply chain is an integral part of YHI’s overall 

operations, YHI also has a Group Management Policy covering ethical conduct in purchasing and procurement. 

This policy outlines the responsibilities of purchasing personnel, including clear and transparent dealings with 

principals/suppliers, no bribery or corruption, and vetting of suppliers to be certain that they are compliant with 

governing regulations. 

A Group Whistle-Blowing Policy has been put in place and communicated to all employees. The Policy provides 

employees with clearly defined processes and channels through which they can raise their concerns or complaints 

in relation to possible violations of the Group’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct or suspected irregularities 

to the Audit Committee through the internal audit function. 

There were zero incidents of anti-corruption, anti-competitive behaviour or anti-trust/monopoly practices reported 

between 2017 and 2019. YHI aims to maintain zero incidents in 2020.
