GemLife Group

Australia

Thakral Capital Holdings Pte Ltd

Singapore

The Group’s Investment Division was set up 

to create another sustainable revenue stream 

and contribute to positive shareholder value. 

It is now by far the largest component of 

the Group in terms of net assets as well as 

profitability.

Thakral Capital Holdings Pte Ltd (“TCH”), the 

holding company of the Group’s Investment 

Division in Australia, was incorporated in 

2009 and the TCH group started operations 

in Australia as Thakral Capital Australia 

Pty Ltd (“TCAP”) in early 2011. TCAP 

operates as a finance partner with real 

estate developers and provides value-added 

services including originating, packaging 

and managing investment projects. It has 

been the financial backer and investment 

partner for a slew of major apartment and 

townhouse developments in Australia since 

2011, investing and committing in excess of 

A$454 million of capital into projects with an 

end value surpassing A$4.3 billion. It has to 

date successfully completed 17 projects, with 

another two in the pipeline, and eight under 

construction. The Group participates in higher 

yielding, niche high-end property projects in gateway cities such as Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.

The division’s retirement living joint venture with the Puljich family, under the GemLife brand, has been successfully 

built into one of Australia’s most respected brands in the resort-style retirement homes sector within 4 years of its 

establishment. Two of GemLife’s resorts – Bribie Island and Highfields, were crowned Master Builders Queensland 

regional winners in 2019 for their respective clubhouses and associated facilities. To date, GemLife has eight resorts 

with more than 1,900 homes in various stages across the eastern seaboard and a pipeline of seven more sites, which 

may add 1,600 homes to be built.

The Group’s diversification into the retirement living segment is expected to provide sustainable returns in a growing 

sector in Australia.

The Group’s Japanese investment portfolio is structured through its pooled investment subsidiaries, Thakral Japan 

Properties Pte Ltd, TJP Pte Ltd and Thakral Umeda Properties Pte Ltd. The portfolio has grown significantly since 

establishment about five years ago and now comprises seven commercial buildings – Yotsubashi Nakano Building, 

Yotsubashi East Building, Itachibori Square, Utsubo East Building, River Point Kitahama Building, Yotsubashi Grand 

and Umeda Pacific Building; and three business hotels – Best Western Osaka Tsukamoto Hotel, R Hotels Inn Osaka 

Kita Umeda and Hotel WBF Namba Motomachi.

The latest addition to its portfolio in 2019 was the Umeda Pacific Building, an 11-storey office building in Osaka. The 

property, located just 3-minute walk from Higashi Umeda Station and the main Osaka Station, sits on 861 sqm of 

freehold land. The building has a gross floor area of 9,179 sqm and net rentable area of 6,359 sqm. The fully-tenanted 

property is prominently and strategically located along Mido Suji with broad street frontage.

The Group looks forward to continuing to capitalise on the growing tenant demand in Osaka together with rising real 

estate values brought about by the limited supply of quality assets and the country’s low interest rates.

The Group will also be looking to sell some of its properties 

to realise profits while continuing its search for reinvesting 

in niche properties.

BOARD STATEMENT

BOARD  

STATEMENT 

Dear Stakeholders,

As the Group progressed to the third year of our sustainability reporting journey, we have also made strides in 

strengthening our sustainability performance. We recognise that the long-term success of our business is closely 

intertwined with the health and prosperity of the communities we operate in. Hence, we have stepped up our efforts 

in managing our material Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) topics to impact our stakeholders positively 

during the year.

STRENGTHENING OUR ESG PERFORMANCE

Economic and Environmental



FY2019 saw the Group continuing to deliver a satisfactory economic performance, registering a profit attributable to 

equity holders. For the year ended 31 December 2019 (“FY2019”), the Group paid two interim dividends totalling 4 

cents per share as it reported a profit of S$9.1 million attributable to equity holders. The Group recognises the need to 

balance financial growth alongside sustainable ESG performance and will continue to strive to maintain high standards 

of corporate accountability and transparency, even as we grow our business.

On the environmental front, we are committed to fully comply with applicable laws and regulations across our business 

operations. Our Investment Division in Australia continues to encourage its partners to meet all applicable green 

standards; obtain prominent energy efficiency and green ratings wherever possible and to deliver designs and use 

eco-friendly materials to minimise the environmental impact on the developments’ communities. The Group’s joint 

venture retirement living resorts under the GemLife brand are designed to offer residents high quality livable units that 

are both attractive and environmentally-friendly. Every GemLife home and clubhouse is fitted with solar panels designed 

to power the entire site. We aim to deliver GemLife’s clients a unique product that is becoming increasingly attractive 

to property savvy baby boomers.

Similarly, energy efficient air-conditioning and lighting was also installed during renovation of certain properties in Japan 

during the year. This will be an ongoing effort undertaken as circumstances permit.

Our Lifestyle Division has limited ability to influence environmental, social and governance practices of its business 

associates. On the supply side, the division generally receives pre-packaged finished goods from brand-owners or 

vendors and has little say in the manufacture or packaging of such products. Manufacturers/brand-owners continue 

to adapt to present day consumer demand that leans towards environmentally-friendly products. Logistics partners 

for bulk shipments are generally appointed by the larger suppliers themselves with cost, margins and speed-to-market 

being major considerations in the choice of service provider. On the sales side, customer requirements determine the 

shipment/delivery mode.

At the operational level, we adhere to basic environment-friendly practices such as switching off lights and air-

conditioning in rooms or spaces unoccupied during the work-day, powering down personal computers overnight, 

on weekends and on holidays, using recycled/EA-Eco printer toners, returning used photocopier toner cartridges for 

recycling in locations that support this, using PEFC/FSC certified paper (i.e., from sustainably managed forests, recycled 

and controlled sources) as well as disposing of used paper in a manner that enables recycling, etc. Board meeting 

documents have been digitalised since 2018 to achieve significantly reduced paper usage.

In FY2019, there were no incidences of regulatory non-compliance with environmental laws and/or regulations.

STATEMENT 

Social



On the social front, we recognise that the importance of building and developing the capabilities of our employees will 

improve our brand profile. We fully support the professional development and occupational needs of our employees, 

enabling them to maintain and advance their skills and productivity. Given the fast-changing and hands-on nature of our 

work, our Lifestyle Division is focused on on-the-job learning and targeted internal workshops. These training initiatives 

advance our teams’ product knowledge, selling and management skills enabling them to work more effectively with 

our brand and channel partners.

The Group has reinforced its commitment towards supporting social and community causes. Our China subsidiary, 

Thakral China Ltd, through collaboration with the Chinese equivalent of Red Cross, identified specific areas in China 

that had difficulties and required financial assistance. The Group provided financial assistance to needy students and 

families and made charitable donations to certain schools in helping to improve/re-build their infrastructure.

The Group made a charitable donation to the Asian Women’s Welfare Association (“AWWA”) in building the second 

AWWA School in Singapore for students with autism. The school, when operational in 2021, will benefit up to 300 

students aged between 7 to 18 years. AWWA is a local Social Service Agency that provides community-based 

programmes and services to people of all ages.

The Group is also proud to be one of the key sponsors of the North East Growth Fund (Milk &amp; Diaper). The North East 

Growth Fund (Milk &amp; Diaper) was introduced to help needy families residing in Singapore’s North East district to defray 

the cost of raising young children. The Group’s contribution supports 250 children per year in Singapore for three years 

with the purchase of formula milk for needy families with children aged three years and below.

Governance



On the governance front, we ensure that ethical and responsible corporate practices are carried out by having a good 

corporate governance structure and ensuring our business process and practices are compliant with the relevant laws 

and regulations. Our Sustainability Working Group (“SWG”) oversees and drives ESG practices across the Group’s 

business, and will continue to integrate sustainability into our daily operation. The approach of integrating sustainability 

initiatives or measurements into our corporate strategy will provide a holistic view of the Group’s ESG performance 

and progress to our stakeholders.

In FY2019, there were no incidences of regulatory non-compliance with laws and/or regulations.

LOOKING AHEAD

The Group is on track to build a resilient business that is committed to integrating sustainable practices into our 

business operations. We believe in doing the right thing, and will continue to place sustainability as an integral 

part of our business. With the support of the Audit Committee and the SWG, the Group will continue to consider 

sustainability matters in the formulation of its strategies, oversee the management of material ESG issues and the 

Group’s sustainability performance. The continuous integration of sustainability measures in our corporate strategy 

will be complemented by quality disclosures to provide stakeholders with a holistic view of the Group’s sustainability 

performance and development.

APPROACH

The Group’s sustainability approach remains focused on value creation for all its stakeholders. The approach follows 

the Group’s sustainability policy, which is to:

Sustainability is managed across the business value chain via relevant policies, programs, and operating procedures 

(“Sustainability Approach”). The Group continually reinforces its employees for its Sustainability Approach through the 

implementation of training programs and ensuring that their roles and responsibilities remain well defined. Furthermore, 

the Group guides Management on decision-making processes to ensure that it continues to deliver its business 

principles across all of its operations.

A risk-based management method is adopted to manage the Group’s Sustainability Approach by reviewing its policies 

periodically and updating its breach response while reporting compliance. The Group firmly believes that Thakral 

must integrate the best practices into its day-to-day operations to honour its sustainability goals and core values. 

Furthermore, Thakral remains true to its long-term goal – to contribute to local economies where the Group has a 

presence and to create a workplace that brings out the best in its employees. Most importantly, the Group wishes to 

build a sustainable business based on trust through sustainable practices. Thus, the Group has adopted a precautionary 

approach by taking critical actions to reduce environmental impact. The Group is also committed to integrating positive 

sustainability practices into its working environment and business processes. This remains essential for Thakral, to 

allow it to continually deliver value to its business partners, foster trust within its communities, and ensure transparency 

and sustainable growth for its investors.

The Group remains committed to being a responsible corporate citizen by embedding sustainability in its operation. 

This entails ensuring that the needs and concerns of the Group’s key stakeholders are taken into consideration in the 

development and execution of its business strategies.

FOCUS

The Group updates the assessment regularly to ensure it remains accurate and relevant to its businesses. This helps it 

to prioritise material Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) factors to continue its communication, reporting, 

and engagements, internally and externally. The Group identified ESG factors by conducting a Stakeholder Engagement 

and Materiality Assessment Workshop during the year with the assistance of its external consultant. The Group reviewed 

the ESG factors of the respective stakeholders for material issues that have the potential to affect its performance in 

the long-term. This allows the Group to understand the concerns of its stakeholders better and to offer better solutions 

to safeguard the sustainability of its business.

In 2018, the Group observed that six material issues were of key priority in its sustainability agenda. For 2019, it 

reassessed and prioritised seven material topics including a new topic, GRI 404: Training and Education. The table 

below outlines the material ESG topics and its scope and boundary for 2019:

DRIVING CHANGE IN PUSHING FOR SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES IN AUSTRALIA

In Thakral’s bid to further drive sustainable business, the Group made it imperative to incorporate environmentally 

friendly practices in all its business strategies. The Management continues to strive for excellence in terms of 

the Group’s environmental practices across the region. This includes constant improvements in energy usage 

efficiencies for its day-to-day business operations.

While maintaining its stellar financial performance, Thakral also ensures that sustainability is embedded in all its 

investment decision to drive long-term growth. Thus, on 30 September 2019, Thakral has acquired 4.4 hectares 

of prime land in Queensland, Australia, through its GemLife joint venture, for over-50s lifestyle resorts in Australia. 

This is in line with Thakral’s expansion into this profitable market of the growing aging population, which in 

turn drives the demand for retirement housing in Australia. Furthermore, before any investments are made, the 

properties and land, which they are developed on, are reviewed thoroughly to ensure that its investment decision 

is environmentally sustainable in the long run. Furthermore, the Group will continue to push for all of its properties 

to meet all applicable green standards as well as obtain energy efficiency and green ratings as Thakral strives to 

minimise its impacts on nature and community where the developments are located. Every GemLife home and 

clubhouse is fitted with solar panels designed to power the entire site.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE7

The Group strongly believes that compliance with environmental laws is crucial to ensure its business minimises any 

negative impact on the environment. Complying with environmental laws and using renewable energies provides the 

company with long-term financial benefits and growth; there are various opportunities for the company to receive 

government subsidies, enabling the division to improve its operations. Within the GemLife business of the Investment 

Division, a review of environmental conditions is taken for each unique project the company executes. This review 

consists of taking into consideration the impact of the development on existing land, nature, or wildlife. Prior to the 

commencement of any site works, submissions are made to the local councils to obtain development approval. 

Moreover, opportunities are explored to create a development which utilises renewable energies, where possible. 

For example, solar panels are installed for the household to reduce the impact on the environment and also helps in 

reducing electricity costs.

To ensure that results are being achieved, constant monitoring and evaluation takes place. For example, external reviews 

are conducted in order to ensure that construction has been completed in accordance with the approved development 

application. This is to ensure that construction results in a safe structure that complies with local building legislation 

and does not negatively impact the environment.

environmental laws, and/or regulations: NIL
