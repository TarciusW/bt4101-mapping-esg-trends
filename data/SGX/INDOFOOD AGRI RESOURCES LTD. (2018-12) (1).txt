Sustainability in Palm Oil: Governance and Management

Each key material topic is managed by teams on

the

ground

under

a

set

of

six

Sustainability

Programmes.

We evaluate our performance for material topics by

measuring progress towards targets. The targets

for certain material topics are an extension of the

ISPO1 certification of estates and processing sites

and

the

PROPER2

environmental

reporting

initiative, namely:

(i) Governance and integrity;

(ii) Land rights;

(iii) Smallholder engagement and livelihoods.

Evaluation of our approach depends on audit

(internal and external), performance trends and

stakeholder feedback.

We recognise that agribusinesses are exposed to a dynamic set of risks and opportunities related 

to the environment, to communities, and to stakeholders.

Guided by our Vision, Mission, Values, and Policy, our teams of well-trained personnel manage

these material topics and impacts in order to improve operational efficiency, to stimulate

innovation, and thus to preserve value over the long-term.
