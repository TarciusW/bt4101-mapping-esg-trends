Dear Stakeholders,

I am pleased to present the 

Sustainability Report of Oxley 

Holdings Limited (the “Company”, 

and together with its subsidiaries, 

“Oxley” or the “Group”) for the 

financial year ended 30 June 

2021 (“FY2021”), which provides 

information on the economic, 

environmental, 

social, 

and 

governance (“EESG”) aspects of 

sustainability practices in our 

2 major operating segments, 

namely property development and 

hospitality. 

In May 2021, due to the challenges 

posed by the COVID-19 pandemic 

that caused delays to construction 

activities, project completions and 

collection of project proceeds, 

the board of directors of the 

Group’s wholly owned subsidiary 

in Australia, Pindan Group Pty Ltd 

(together with its subsidiaries, the 

“Pindan Group”) decided to appoint 

voluntary administrators for 

Pindan Group.  The appointment 

of voluntary administrators has led 

to the Group’s loss of control over 

Pindan Group, and therefore the 

construction operating segment 

will not be covered in this report.

CHAIRMAN’S 

MESSAGE



FY2021 has been a challenging 

year for the Group due to various 

disruptions caused by COVID-19. 

On-going property development 

projects were affected to varying 

degrees by lockdowns, movement 

restrictions and man-power 

and resource shortages. Our 

hotel business continues to be 

negatively impacted by the severe 

downturn in the travel and tourism 

sector.  Nonetheless, the Group 

remains committed to integrating 

sustainability practices into our 

business operations. 

The Group places strong emphasis 

on environmental sustainability 

considerations in the design and 

construction of our residential, 

commercial and hotel properties 

and we aim to achieve green 

building certifications for our 

buildings. The Group continually 

strives to optimize energy and 

water usage levels in our hotel 

operations.  In addition, we have 

also implemented various green 

practices such as to reduce and 

eliminate the usage of disposable 

plastics comprising straws and 

bottles and replace them with 

more eco-friendly alternatives.  We 

have also embarked on “Mercure 

Discover Local Campaign” this year 

in a bid to source fresh ingredients 

from local farms and reduce our 

carbon footprint in food sourcing, 

to the extent possible.  

Health and safety are important to 

us.  Our commitment to workplace 

health and safety is reflected in 

the selection of contractors and 

suppliers who are competent 

and committed to managing 

environmental, health and safety 

risks and our strong advocacy 

among contractors and suppliers 

on the importance of maintaining 

safe work practices.  

Our hotels have continued 

to 

support 

the 

Singapore 

government’s COVID-19 measures 

and served as accommodation 

facilities for people served with 

Stay Home Notices or Quarantine 

Orders during FY2021.  Whilst 

providing the facilities, the hotels 

have also implemented strict 

measures to protect the health and 

safety of the employees working at 

the hotels.  

This year, we have expanded 

disclosure of the ESG targets to 

include our property development 

businesses 

overseas. 

 

We 

will endeavour to integrate 

sustainability practices into 

our business operations as we 

continue to expand our footprint 

overseas.    

At Oxley, we believe that a diverse 

workforce brings different skillsets 

and experience to the Group.  As 

such, we hire employees of different 

ages (including post-retirement), 

genders and nationalities to 

diversify our workforce.  We value 

the contributions of all our staff and 

remunerate them fairly.

On behalf of the board of 

directors (the “Board”), I would 

like to express my gratitude to 

our clients, business partners and 

shareholders for their unwavering 

support over the years. We look 

forward to your continuing support 

as we strive to develop a more 

sustainable environment for all.

Oxley is an international property 

group established in 2010 and 

headquartered in Singapore. Oxley 

specialises in the development of 

quality residential, commercial, 

industrial and hospitality projects. 

These developments are typically 

located in choice areas that 

are easily accessible. Most of 

its projects incorporate retail 

elements, as well as lifestyle 

features and facilities.

Oxley is listed on the Main Board 

of the SGX-ST (SGX: 5UX) and 

has a market capitalisation of 

approximately $0.9 billion as at 

16 September 2021. Since its 

incorporation, Oxley has launched 

a portfolio of 48 projects, of which 

36 projects have been completed.

Oxley has a strong reputation 

in market foresight, execution, 

marketing and sales, which 

is evident in its project track 

record in Singapore in the past 

years. The Group has launched 

and sold more than 3,600 

residential and commercial 

units in Singapore since April 

2018. Four out of the Group’s 

ten residential development 

projects in Singapore, namely The 

Addition, Sea Pavilion Residences, 

Sixteen35 Residences and The 

Verandah Residences, have 

obtained Temporary Occupation 

Permits (“TOP”).  The remaining 

projects are expected to obtain 

TOP progressively in 2022 and 

2023.

For the hospitality segment, 

the Group owns the 254-room 

Novotel Singapore on Stevens 

and 518-room Mercure Singapore 

on Stevens which are located 

in a lush urban paradise just 

minutes away from the iconic 

Orchard Road shopping belt and 

Botanic Gardens, a UNESCO World 

Heritage Site.

Building on this strong foundation, 

Oxley has also been successful in 

expanding its footprint overseas. 

Currently, the Group has a 

business presence across various 

geographical markets including 

Singapore, the United Kingdom 

(the “UK”), Ireland, Cyprus, 

Cambodia, Malaysia, the People’s 

Republic of China (“PRC”) and 

Vietnam. 

Our flagship project in the UK, a 

waterfront township development 

in London, Royal Wharf, has been 

fully completed and is close to 

100% sold.  Dublin Landings, 

one of the largest mixed-use 

developments in the business 

district of Dublin, Ireland achieved 

practical completion for its three 

remaining residential blocks 

in June 2021 and is in the final 

stages of completing the sale 

transaction of its remaining 

residential block.  The Group’s 

mega mixed-use development 

in Phnom Penh, The Peak, is 

87% sold as at 16 September 

2021. Construction for its retail, 

residential and office components 

have been completed, whilst the 

hotel component is expected to be 

completed in 2022.

The Group’s upcoming projects 

include i) Connolly Station, a 

mixed-use 

development 

in 

Ireland comprising 180 residential 

type units, 6 office blocks and a 

hotel with 236 rooms (subject 

to finalisation of planning 

permission), ii) Deanston Wharf, 

a 

mixed-use 

development 

in London which will deliver 

769 new homes, 1,125 sqm of 

commercial floorspace and a 

170-metre-long expansion to the 

adjoining Lyle Park, iii) Mozac, a 

270-unit residential development 

in Vietnam and iv) Trinity 

Wellnessa, a 1,200-unit residential 

development in Malaysia.

As at 30 June 2021, Oxley holds an 

approximately 9.4% stake in Aspen 

(Group) Holdings Limited (“AGH”), 

a Malaysian-based property group 

listed in Singapore and a 40% 

equity interest in Aspen Vision 

Homes Sdn. Bhd., a subsidiary of 

AGH, which is slated to develop a 

mixed-use project in Penang.

Oxley posted total revenue from continuing operations, of S$1.36 billion for FY2021 representing growth 

of 33% compared to S$1.03 billion for FY2020.  This was mainly due to higher revenue from the projects 

in Cambodia, Singapore and Ireland, partially offset by lower revenue from the project in the UK.  The 

Group achieved a net profit of S$49.5 million for FY2021. Excluding the loss from discontinued operations 

of S$40.0 million as a result of the voluntary administration of Pindan Group, the Group would have 

generated profit after tax of S$89.5 million from continuing operations, a turnaround from the S$266.83 

million net loss position in FY2020.

ENVIRONMENT

Oxley is committed to be a responsible corporate citizen in the communities that we operate in, and 

we endeavour to deliver safe, environmentally sustainable and high-quality property developments. We 

strive to minimise our impact on the environment by reducing our carbon footprint, energy and water 

consumption in our business operations.

Energy Consumption, Emissions and Waste Management 

Sustainable Buildings

At Oxley, we are committed to designing green and sustainable buildings. All our newly completed 

properties have received Green Mark certifications, which is a testament to our commitment to 

maintaining the environmental friendliness and sustainability of our buildings in terms of design, 

construction and operations. 

We continuously work towards improving the energy and water efficiency of our properties. Apart from 

implementing energy-efficient features such as LED lights or photovoltaics in the common areas of our 

properties, we also adopt energy-efficient air-conditioning systems and motion-sensor lightings where 

possible, to optimise energy consumption.  Our properties are also designed with water-efficient features 

that adhere to local regulations and requirements.

Oxley is committed to working closely with contractors and subcontractors to manage our energy 

efficiency and carbon footprint. They are required to comply with our environmental policies and 

guidelines at all geographical locations where we operate.

Energy Efficiency

The orientation of the buildings 

and units in the development 

are predominantly north-south 

facing with no direct west-

facing windows. Energy efficient 

features such as 4-ticks energy-

efficient air conditioners and 

energy efficient lifts with sleep 

mode features are installed in 

the buildings.

Water Conservation

The development uses Excellent 

or Very Good WELS (“Water 

Efficiency Labelling Scheme”) 

rated water fittings to optimize 

water usage.

Sustainable Facilities

Sheltered bicycle lots are 

provided to encourage low-

carbon commuting in line with 

Singapore’s plan towards a 

car-lite culture.  Recycling bins 

are placed at open areas that 

are convenient and accessible 

to the residents to encourage 

recycling habits. 

Green Construction 

The development uses 

Prefabricated Bathroom 

Units (“PBUs”) which is pre-

assembled off-site complete 

with finishes, sanitary wares, 

concealed pipes, ceiling and 

bathroom cabinets before they 

are delivered and installed 

on-site.  This brings various 

benefits including improved 

productivity from man-power 

savings, a better construction 

environment due to less 

pollution generated on site and 

better control of the quality of 

the end product. 



Featured Development Project 1: Affinity at Serangoon, Singapore

O X L E Y  H O L D I N G S  L I M I T E D   |    S U S T A I N A B I L I T Y  R E P O R T  2 0 2 1      1 1


Energy Consumption and 

Emissions Management

Electricity is a major source of the hotels’ 

energy consumption and greenhouse 

gas (“GHG”) emissions. To reduce 

energy usage and emissions in the daily 

operations, 80% of the lights installed 

at the hotels are energy-efficient LED 

lights. We encourage all employees 

to practice environmentally friendly 

habits such as switching off lights and 

air-conditioning when not in use.  

Energy Efficiency

As the site is elongated 

in shape, a key design 

consideration was to minimize 

any residential unit’s façade 

exposure to the west-facing 

sun and this was achieved by 

locating the staircase and lift 

core on the western elevation. 

This helps reduce energy 

consumption by reducing heat 

load. The residential units are 

equipped with 4-tick energy-

efficient air conditioners and 

energy-efficient lifts with sleep 

mode features. The common 

areas of the development are 

fitted with LED lights that come 

with timers and sensors to 

reduce power consumption.

Water Saving

Approximately 80% of 

the development uses 

Excellent-rated WELS and 

the remaining 20%, Very 

Good-rated WELS rating water 

fittings to optimize water 

usage. The development 

also incorporated water-mist 

fire-protection system which 

uses 80% less water than 

a standard water-sprinkler 

system.

Sustainable Facilities

Common recycling bins are 

provided for the residents of 

the development to encourage 

recycling habits.

Transportation

To maximise land usage 

for greeneries and for 

resident’s communal facilities, 

a mechanised carpark 

system was applied for the 

development. There is a bus 

stop outside the development 

and a sheltered walkway 

directly linked to the lift lobby 

was built to encourage the use 

of public transportation among 

the residents.

Green Environment

The development is surrounded 

by lush greenery. Aside from 

ground planting, a full-height 

green wall and sky garden are 

provided for the development.



Featured Development Project 2: Sea Pavilion Residences, Singapore

The Sea Pavilion Residences involves the conservation of a beach 

out-house that was on the edge of what used to be the Singapore 

coastline. This has been refurbished to host the resident’s 

common facilities. The construction of the new residential block 

applied buildable and environmental-friendly products such as 

aerated autoclaved concrete that are less labour intensive and 

utilise recycled aggregates. Apart from that, the development 

also uses cementitions products &amp; carpentry laminates endorsed 

by the Singapore Green Building Council.

The hotels served as accommodation facilities for people served with Stay Home Notices or Quarantine 

Orders for the full FY2021 compared to four months in FY2020.  There was a significant reduction in 

hospitality services compared to pre-COVID-19 days as some of the practices such as daily change of 

linen have been cancelled. Hence, the energy consumption and GHG emissions at both the hotels have 

further decreased compared to FY2020.  Energy consumption and GHG emissions at Novotel Singapore 

on Stevens and Mercure Singapore on Stevens have decreased by 32% and 21% respectively in FY2021 

compared to FY2020.

Reducing Plastic Pollution

We are committed to playing our part towards minimizing plastic waste. Since 2019, the hotels 

have signed up with the Plastic ACTion initiative by the World Wildlife Fund Singapore, which aims 

to eliminate plastic pollution and move towards a circular economy on plastics. All plastic straws 

and plastic stirrers are no longer used in the hotels and all takeaway packaging products have been 

replaced with biodegradable options. We have also eradicated the use of plastic bottles at events and 

seminars and replaced them with reusable water jugs and cups. We are progressively doing away 

with disposable plastic products and individually packaged materials such as plastic cotton buds and 

replacing them with more ecological options. The hotels also continuously work with Accor’s global and 

regional procurement teams to identify and adopt greener solutions in the hotel operations.

Sustainable Food and Beverage Culture 

To reduce carbon footprint in food sourcing, we embarked on 

“Mercure’s Discover Local Campaign” and sourced fresh 

ingredients from local farms.  

In June this year, we partnered with Kin Yan Agrotech, a local 

organic farm which produces and supplies wheatgrass, aloe 

vera and mushrooms which are high in nutritional value, free 

from any form of artificial components such as pesticides, 

chemical and artificial fertilizers to bring in fresh, locally grown 

mushrooms.  This collaboration with our passionate and 

talented hotel culinary team inspired new culinary creations 

like baked fish with braised mushroom and black fungus and 

mushroom-inspired cocktail drinks. 

From April to December 2021, there will be a series of Discover 

Local Campaigns to bring in other locally farmed products such 

as eggs, fish and goat milk to Winestone, the modern European 

restaurant at Mercure hotel.





The hotels have been awarded impact certificates by BioPak as a recognition for their 

support on the use of sustainable packaging

Contractor Environmental and Social Assessment

All main contractors and subcontractors are reviewed and selected based on workplace health and 

safety,  environmental and social criteria, while all suppliers are reviewed and selected based on their 

product quality and timeliness of delivery.

We assess new contractors and subcontractors based on their track records and worksite health and 

safety practices during the quotation and tendering process before awarding the contract. Those who do 

not meet our standards will be delisted from our approved list of vendors.

We will continue to screen our appointed main contractors to ensure their competence and commitment 

to environment, health and safety based on recognized benchmarks such as the BCA Green and Gracious 

Builder and Construction Quality Assessment System (“CONQUAS”) scores in Singapore. 

Environmental Awareness 

The Group understands that climate change is one of the biggest threats our world faces today. We 

therefore strive to enhance awareness of environmental protection amongst our employees and 

stakeholders through participation in environment-related events. 

To demonstrate our commitment towards climate action, the hotels participated in the annual Earth 

Hour which was held on 27 March this year to switch off or dim the lights in guest rooms, restaurants 

and common areas. In July 2021, the hotels also participated in the Singapore Green Plan Climate Action 

Week 2021 during which a line-up of activities was held to rally citizens and communities to take collective 

climate action and secure a sustainable future for Singapore. 

During FY2021, the Group had no incidence of non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations.



ENVIRONMENT

The use of overfished species including 

sharks, rays, bluefin tunas, groupers, 

eels and caviar from wild sturgeons are 

currently banned at the hotels.  Where 

possible, 

food 

products 

with 

third 

party labels (e.g. fair-trade, organic) are 

purchased.  To manage food waste, such 

waste is also measured and tracked on a 

daily basis at the hotels. 

Commonly used herbs in the hotel 

kitchens are grown in the herb garden 

so as to have greater control over the 

level of pesticides used and offer hotel 

diners healthier and better quality food 

ingredients.

The safety and well-being of our staff, customers, hotel guests, partners and contractors remain of 

utmost importance to us.

In addition to incorporating environmentally sustainable features in our developments, our priority is 

to ensure safety standards are maintained at project sites during the construction phase and we deliver 

safe and quality buildings to our customers.

Oxley also actively manages the hotel operator to ensure strict compliance with local environmental 

and social laws and regulations.  Our aim is to provide a positive hospitality experience while running 

a sustainable operation.  The health and safety of our guests and employees are ensured through the 

implementation of sound food and physical safety practices.

Occupational Health and Safety (“OHS”)

Construction Safety Management

The Group ensures all contractors and subcontractors are notified of their worksite health and safety 

responsibilities during the vendor selection process, and are able to meet the standards that qualify for 

International Organisation for Standardisation (“ISO”) certifications.

We also appoint Design for Safety (“DfS”) professionals to identify, design and implement measures to 

eliminate and mitigate foreseeable risks to health and safety during and beyond the construction stage 

i.e. subsequent use and maintenance of the buildings.

In FY2021, there was one contractor staff work-related fatality5 and one incident of safety lapse at one of 

our project sites.  Necessary follow up actions to rectify safety-related non-compliances on the site have 

been taken.  We will continue to monitor the OHS performance of our main contractors and reinforce 

safety standards. 

Occupational Health and Safety

The Group is aware that staff health and safety is an important consideration in running a hotel business. 

During the initial selection of the hotel operator, we assessed the safety practices and procedures adopted 

in maintaining employee health and safety. We also assess the hotel operator annually to ensure that 

there is no breach of employee health and safety regulations and protocols. The hotel operator has 

to train the employees regularly to adhere to safety policies. We periodically review safety risks and 

implement safety measures to mitigate these risks.

In FY2021, there was no major breach of regulations on occupational health and safety at our hotels.

Based on preliminary investigations, the incident is not due to contractor negligence and there was no SWO issued to the 

project site.

Customer Health and Safety 

Occupant Safety

The Group’s property development projects comply with local design and construction requirements and 

guidelines. 

To comply with BCA Code on Accessibility in the Built Environment, we have implemented barrier-

free access in our properties to ensure our buildings are accessible and user-friendly to persons with 

disabilities and families with young children.

To ensure fire safety, we have implemented Home Fire Alarm Device (“HFAD”) which sounds an early 

warning to alert the occupants of an impending fire.

We comply with CONQUAS, an assessment system developed by BCA, for the construction of our 

properties. This assessment evaluates the quality of building projects and considers aspects such as 

safety, comfort and aesthetic defects.

COVID-19 Safety Measures

Since the onset of COVID-19, the Group has adapted to providing virtual show flat tours for prospective 

property buyers.  Further steps have been taken to allow keen buyers to purchase an apartment and 

complete the entire paperwork process remotely through electronic payment platforms and electronic 

signing of documents at the point of sales.  This has helped to minimize physical interaction, enabling us 

to protect the health of our employees and customers whilst at the same time, minimizing disruption to 

business operations.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the hotels have served as accommodation facilities for people served 

with Stay Home Notices or Quarantine Orders.  The hotels are aware of the potential impact of health 

and safety on our guests and employees. Apart from more regular cleaning and disinfection of high-

touch common areas, precautionary measures such as temperature screening before entering the hotels 

and movement monitoring through safe entry check-in applications are implemented. The hotels strictly 

follow social distancing measures and review the policies regularly in order to adhere to government 

policies and to ensure the safety of employees.

Hotel Guest Health and Safety

The hotel operator, Accor, is a reputable international hotel management group. The hotel management 

team takes the safety and security of the hotel guests seriously and regularly reviews the safety measures. 

Proper safety measures such as implementing fire safety measures and conducting routine fire drills at 

the hotel premises are put in place. Security cameras are installed at the hotel premises and only hotel 

guests are able to gain access to their hotel rooms with their room cards.  

The hotel operator is required to comply with laws administered by the National Environment Agency 

(“NEA”) and other local health and safety regulations. During FY2021, there was no major incidence of 

non-compliance with guest health and safety regulations.

Ethical Product Marketing

At Oxley, we strictly comply with Controller of Housing (“COH”) guidelines which require show units to be 

accurately depicted. We also obtain the approval of COH for our building plans before opening our show 

flats for viewing.

Below are the key COH guidelines that we comply with:

By complying with COH guidelines, we provide assurance to prospective buyers that our show units 

accurately represent the units for sale and ensure that there is no marketing misrepresentation.

In FY2021, there was zero incidence of non-compliance concerning marketing communication of our 

properties.

Customer Privacy Protection 

Oxley takes utmost care in protecting the privacy and data of hotel guests. The hotels are in strict 

compliance with the PDPA.

There was no reported breach of data privacy regulation in FY2021.

Compliance with Socioeconomic Laws

At Oxley, we endeavour to be a socially responsible corporate citizen and we strictly comply with local 

social laws and regulations in the countries where we operate.  

Our selected hotel operator, Accor, ensures strict compliance with local and international legal 

frameworks, including the International Labour Organisation’s fundamental conventions and the 

ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact. Accor exercises due diligence when assessing 

their suppliers and service providers to ensure there are no incidences of child labour and forced or 

compulsory labour.

In FY2021, there was no incidence of non-compliance with social laws and regulations on discrimination, 

child labour, forced or compulsory labour and infringement of human rights.

At Oxley, we endeavour to create an inclusive 

workplace environment, and are committed 

to mutual respect, fairness and equality for all 

our employees. We provide opportunities for 

continuous learning and skills improvement.

Workforce Diversity

We advocate fair employment and endeavour 

to achieve a balanced and diversified workforce, 

including hiring employees above the Singapore 

mandated retirement age of 62 years old. As at 

30 June 2021, our total staff strength was 153.

Employee Remuneration and Benefits

We recognise the valuable contribution of all employees. We strongly believe in fair remuneration. All 

employees are assessed regularly and remunerated fairly based on their experience, qualifications and 

performance.

We prioritise the welfare of our employees by offering a range of employee benefits such as medical 

insurance, healthcare and parental leave. During FY2021, 7 employees took parental leave and 6 returned 

to work in FY2021 after their parental leave ended.

Training and Education

The hotel team recognizes that staff training and development is vital to the smooth running of daily 

operations and sustained business growth. External training courses and on-the-job training are provided 

to employees to help them to improve or pick up new skills, keep pace with industry changes and improve 

employee job satisfaction and morale. The downtime last year due to COVID-19 was an opportune time 

for training and the hotels took advantage of various government funding schemes e.g. Job ReDesign 

and Skills Future Enterprise Credit, to send employees for training.  It was a win-win for both employees 

and the hotels as employees were able to upskill and diversify their skills set whilst the hotels managed 

to retain the headcount.

Equal Opportunity

The Group is committed to creating and maintaining an inclusive and collaborative workplace culture in 

which all can thrive. The Group is dedicated to maintaining workplaces that are free from discrimination, 

physical or verbal harassment against any individual on the basis of race, religion, colour, gender, physical 

or mental disability, age, place of origin, marital status and sexual orientation. During FY2021, there was 

no incidence of discrimination reported.
