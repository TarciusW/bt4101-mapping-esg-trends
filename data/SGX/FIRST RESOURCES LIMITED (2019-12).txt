We are pleased to present 

First Resources’ 2019 

Sustainability Report. 

In this report, we 

provide a transparent 

account of our 

commitments, successes 

and challenges in 

integrating sustainability 

practices across our 

operations. The contents 

of this report have 

been determined by a 

refreshed materiality 

assessment in 2019, and 

ongoing stakeholder 

dialogue. 

This report should be 

read in conjunction with 

First Resources’ Annual 

Report and website, as 

some information will 

be accessible through 

those channels. The 

reporting exercise is not 

only an important facet 

of our commitment 

to transparency and 

accountability to 

stakeholders, it also 

allows us to reflect on the 

progress we have made 

and the areas that still 

need work. 

SCOPE OF THE REPORT [102-45, 102-50, 102-52]

This report covers the operations of First Resources Limited (First 

Resources) in Indonesia and Singapore, and excludes our rubber 

plantations in Indonesia, which contributes to a very small proportion of 

our business. We produce a sustainability report on an annual basis and 

the content of this report focuses primarily on activities carried out within 

the financial year ended 31 December 2019. Where applicable, data from 

previous financial years have been included for comparison. 

REPORTING FRAMEWORK [102-54]

Our report is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative 

(GRI) Standards: Core option. The GRI content index can be found at the 

end of this report, on pages 60–67. The GRI disclosure numbers have also 

been included below the titles throughout the report where the relevant 

information is covered.

We have determined the content of this report using the GRI principles 

of stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context, materiality and 

completeness. To ensure the quality of our content, we have applied the  

GRI principles of accuracy, balance, clarity, comparability, reliability  

and timeliness. 

This report also adheres to the SGX-ST Listing Rule 711A on preparing an 

annual sustainability report and describes our sustainability practices with 

reference to the primary components set out in SGX-ST Listing Rule 711B.

DATA AND ASSURANCE [102-56]

We did not engaged a third party in the assurance of our sustainability 

report this year. In-depth assessments have been undertaken in material 

areas such as High Carbon Stock (HCS), High Conservation Value (HCV) 

and Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), which provide strong 

independent verification of our performance. Furthermore, all of the data 

included in this report has been subjected to rigorous reviews as part of our 

internal processes.

Dear Stakeholders,

This Sustainability Report is our 

sixth report, communicating our 

Group’s commitment, approach and 

progress towards sustainable business 

practices. Since our inaugural 

sustainability report for FY2011 and 

our pledge for “No Deforestation, 

No Peat and No Exploitation” 

(NDPE) in July 2015, we have made 

significant strides towards striking 

a balance between seeking financial 

profitability, providing genuine long-

term economic and social benefits for 

our surrounding communities, and 

protecting the natural environment 

that we operate in. This is no easy task 

as the balance is a very delicate one, 

where there can often be conflicting 

stakeholder needs and shifting 

priorities and concerns over time. 

We express our commitment to 

sustainability through the continual 

alignment of our understanding 

and values, the championing of 

behavioural changes within our 

organisation, and the upgrading of 

our business processes. And to these 

ends, over the last decade or so, we 

have grown our in-house technical 

capabilities in several sustainability 

sub-disciplines, incorporated 

sustainability considerations when 

evaluating operational and strategic  

initiatives, and introduced 

sustainability key performance 

indicators for senior and other 

relevant executives. Our Board also 

takes into consideration sustainability 

issues and concerns relating to 

environmental and social factors 

as part of its strategic formulation, 

and oversees the identification, 

management and monitoring of 

material sustainability risks as part of 

its risk management process.

The views and inputs from 

stakeholders matter to us. Your 

feedback provides us with insights on 

prevailing sustainability priorities and 

trends, and on where we can aspire 

to do more. We also rely on credible 

third-party assessors to take stock of 

how we are performing. We  

thank you for your interest in  

reading this sustainability report, 

and invite you to share with us any 

feedback to improve and enrich our 

sustainability journey.

CHALLENGES IN 2019 

2019 was truly a difficult year for 

our industry, which saw the lowest 

average crude palm oil (CPO) prices 

in more than a decade, as well as an 

annual decline in CPO production 

for ourselves and many of our 

peers. Consequently, our economic 

profit fell year-on-year. Profitability 

in the oil palm sector suffered so 

badly that during some parts of 

2019, independent smallholders 

experienced very poor cashflows. 

These independent smallholders’ 

knee-jerk reaction was to curtail 

fertiliser applications, which 

would bring about longer term 

detrimental effects to production. 

Our smallholder cooperatives, or 

commonly termed as plasma farmers, 

were able to reap better prices which 

were set by regional governments. 

From a sustainability perspective, 

we were able to contribute to our 

plasma farmers’ economic viability by 

providing them fairer prices.

The same year also brought a new 

season of transboundary haze across 

Southeast Asia. Unfortunately 

in 2019, many mainstream news 

media continued to castigate the 

oil palm industry, as they believed 

irresponsible actors were clearing 

land by fire with the intention to 

plant oil palm. One needs to bear 

in mind the market environment in 

2019, where exceedingly low palm 

oil prices have resulted in both 

large scale oil palm producers and 

smallholders to suffer negative or 

abysmal profits. It seems illogical 

therefore that there would be strong 



S U S T A I N A B I L I T Y  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9

03


desire and means to plant new oil 

palm trees under such circumstances, 

as any new planting would require 

further capital investments for the 

next three years. In fact, palm oil 

prices had been low for some time 

already, starting even before 2019 

and new seed sales for planting have 

reportedly been low. While one 

cannot refute that land clearing was 

a likely trigger for the fires, squarely 

shifting the blame on oil palm is 

unjust, and could well be counter-

productive by bringing about the 

wrong remedy to the detriment of 

everyone. For instance, smallholders 

should be taught the benefits of land 

clearing using non-burning methods, 

as opposed to the benefits of one crop 

versus another.

Relating to this haze episode, we 

have drawn from the 2015 El Niño 

experience and have toughened 

our efforts on fire prevention and 

management. Although we have 

been following a strict Zero Burning 

policy for many years now, even 

before our Roundtable on Sustainable 

Palm Oil (RSPO) membership 

in 2008, the biggest risk for us is 

fire spreading from outside of our 

planted concessions. Over the years, 

we have invested efforts in mapping 

out fire prone areas, increasing fire-

fighting facilities as well as reaching 

out to more communities on the 

importance in fire prevention.

OUR PROGRESS ON 

PROTECTING THE 

ENVIRONMENT

With climate change taking centre 

stage in the list of global concerns, 

we are committed to doing our part. 

We have methane capture facilities at 

three of our mills, which has helped 

1 

https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator



the Group reduce greenhouse gas 

emissions by approximately 81,000 

tonnes of CO2e in 2019, equivalent to 

emissions from the electricity use of 

approximately 13,700 homes in one 

year1. We also installed new methane 

capture facilities at two mills in 2019. 

Forest and biodiversity protection 

also remain high on our agenda, 

with about 20,000 hectares of land 

identified as conservation areas. As 

of 2019, we planted nearly 15,000 

forest trees in our concession areas, 

covering 43 hectares. We also 

focused on improving our yield 

and extraction rates, to support the 

growth of our business without the 

need for developing on new land. One 

example is that we are using our own 

seeds that produce about 20% higher 

yields than what we used to have, 

to replant around 1,500 hectares of 

our old oil palm trees in 2019. Our 

replanting programme continues 

in 2020 and beyond, and we will 

continue to rely on our own planting 

materials.

ON TRACK TO MEET OUR 

TRACEABILITY TARGETS

First Resources has maintained 

100% traceability to mills since 2017, 

with approximately 8% of our crude 

palm oil feedstock sourced from our 

external suppliers. To provide more 

transparency and mitigate the risk 

of policy non-compliance in our 

supply chain, we have since disclosed 

the coordinates and addresses of 

our suppliers’ mills. Traceability 

to plantations for First Resources- 

owned mills remains at 98%, and 

we are on track to achieve 100% 

traceability by 2020.

ASSESSING LABOUR 

PRACTICES AND HUMAN 

RIGHTS

On the social front, we continue to 

ensure that proper labour practices 

are in place and human rights are 

protected. In 2019, we conducted 

internal labour and human rights 

assessments for two to three of 

our estates in each region. Issues 

that were looked into included 

compensation practices such 

as payslip standardisation and 

overtime incentives, implementation 

of proper workers’ agreements, 

awareness on collective bargaining 

and grievance mechanisms, as well 

as the importance of education for 

children. We have already addressed 

some areas of improvement and will 

continue to do so in 2020. 

LOOKING AHEAD 

Although we made significant 

strides in a number of areas in 2019, 

progress had been slower in some 

others. Our RSPO certification 

process was halted in 2019 due to 

a previous grievance case that was 

re-opened. The case has now been 

resolved, and we have proceeded 

to secure RSPO certification for 

another mill in early 2020. We remain 

committed to achieving our target of 

having all our mills and plantations 

certified by 2024. To meet this target, 

we plan to certify another five of our 

mills, integrated with plantations, 

by the end of 2020.  We also aim to 

achieve the Indonesia Sustainable 

Palm Oil (ISPO) certifications for 

another five of our mills integrated 

with plantations by 2020. 

With Indonesia aiming to increase its 

domestic biofuel mix, it is imperative 

that we meet the rising demand 

for palm oil in a sustainable and 

responsible way. We have plans to 

build a new integrated processing 

complex in the near future, housing 

a new kernel crushing plant, a new 

refinery and fractionation plant, as 

well as a biodiesel plant. As we grow 

our reliance on third-party suppliers 

to meet our feedstock requirements, 

more robust measures will need to 

be put in place to ensure traceability 

and compliance with our Policy on 

Sustainable Palm Oil. 





Finally, it is with a heavy heart that 

we discuss about the COVID-19 

pandemic, which the world remains 

in the grip of as I write this letter. The 

disruption caused to societies and 

businesses has been tremendous and 

continues to unfold. We hope that 

the economic fallout and movement 

restrictions will not materially impact 

the sustainability work plans that 

we have lined up for 2020. While we 

are bracing for a big and drawn out 

storm, our immediate thoughts and 

concerns are for the wellbeing of 

everyone, including our employees, 

our plasma farmers and all other 

stakeholders.  We will continue to 

prioritise workplace safety above all 

other priorities, and we fully support 

the strong measures being taken to 

address this pandemic. We wish all 

our stakeholders good health, and we 

hope to continue our collaboration in 

shaping First Resources’ sustainability 

journey going forward.

OUR APPROACH TO 

SUSTAINABILITY

[102-16]

As an agribusiness, sustainability is integral to 

how First Resources conducts business activities. 

We recognise that our long-term success relies on 

the ongoing health of the environment we depend 

on, as well as the well-being of the stakeholders 

we interact with. The principle of sustainability 

is implicit within the values that guide our 

behaviours, actions and decisions. Our values, 

described on our website, are Loyalty, Integrity, 

Diligence, Persistence and Care.

OUR POLICY ON 

SUSTAINABLE PALM OIL 

We strive to ensure that our operations create 

sustainable development by taking into account 

the needs of our stakeholders and maintaining 

the highest social and environmental standards. 

In 2015, we launched our Policy on Sustainable 

Palm Oil, which sets out our commitments to 

“No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation”, 

and is also referred to as our NDPE policy. Our 

commitments guide us towards our goal of 

ensuring that the establishment and management 

of our oil palm plantations provide genuine long-

term economic and social benefits for the local 

communities where we operate and beyond, while 

protecting the environment.  It communicates the 

social and environmental standards we expect to 

be upheld across our operations, including our 

subsidiaries and associated companies, as well as 

our third-party suppliers.

OUR APPROACH TO 

SUSTAINABILITY

IMPLEMENTING OUR POLICY

We remain mindful of our 

ongoing task to translate our 

policy commitments into action 

on the ground. As a key player in 

the Indonesian palm oil sector, 

we understand that achieving a 

sustainable business requires ongoing 

engagement and collaboration with 

our key industry players, suppliers 

and business partners. A summary 

of our main stakeholder engagement 

efforts in 2019 can be found in 

the Materiality and Stakeholder 

Engagement section of this report. 

We engage and train all relevant 

employees on our policy and provide 

additional support on social and 

environmental issues for key areas 

of the business. We socialise our 

policy with all our suppliers, through 

our supplier onboarding process, 

one-on-one meetings or group 

sessions to help them understand our 

commitments and the importance 

of aligning their practices with our 

requirements. To date, feedback from 

participating suppliers has generally 

been supportive and constructive. 

For more details on our engagement 

with our suppliers, see the section on 

Supply Chain. We also work with our 

customers to improve practices. For 

example, we implemented corrective 

action plans in 2019, based on the 

findings and recommendations  

from a customer's labour and human 

rights audit. 

MONITORING AND  

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE 

[102-17]

We have set up a robust system 

to ensure that practices and 

performance related to our policies 

can be monitored and reported. We 

have two distinct mechanisms for 

reporting concerns or complaints: 

our whistleblowing procedure and 

our grievance procedure. Both 

mechanisms are open to external and 

internal stakeholders. 

Whistleblowing Procedure 

Our whistleblowing procedure is 

designed to ensure that employees 

and business partners have a safe, 

anonymous and straightforward 

channel to alert us to concerns, non-

compliances or grievances.  

The system makes use of easy 

access tools, including anonymous 

complaints boxes in estates, SMS, 

phone and email services. Complaints 

raised through these channels are 

generally handled locally but can be 

escalated to the Audit Committee 

where material. 

First Resources does not tolerate nor 

condone any actions taken against 

any employee in retaliation for raising 

a compliance or integrity issue. The 

company may institute disciplinary 

action against any party found to 

have taken such retaliatory action 

against whistleblowers. Anyone 

wishing to make a whistleblowing 

report may refer to the details on  

our website. 

Grievance Procedure 

We also have a grievance procedure 

in place for stakeholders to register 

sustainability-related concerns, 

particularly with regard to our Policy 

on Sustainable Palm Oil, such as 

those related to deforestation, land 

disputes, human rights or general 

labour issues. 

Grievances can be submitted via 

email to our Grievance Officer or 

can be posted via mail to our office 

address as follows:

8 Temasek Boulevard

#36-02 Suntec Tower Three

Singapore 038988

Attn: Grievance Officer 

(Sustainability Department)

E sustainability@first-resources.com

Our philosophy is to work 

collaboratively and constructively 

with all our stakeholders. We want 

stakeholders to engage us directly 

with their concerns, so that these 

can be investigated and addressed 

through remediation, if necessary, 

and as quickly as possible. In this 

regard, we appreciate and welcome 

stakeholders, 

including non-

governmental 

organisations 

(NGOs), to engage 

positively with us  

and help us to  

address gaps in  

our operations.

GOVERNANCE OF 

SUSTAINABILITY

[102-18, 102-19, 102-20, 102-21,  

102-26, 102-32, 103-3]

We are committed to maintaining 

the highest standards of corporate 

governance at First Resources. 

This is crucial for the effective 

implementation of our policies and 

ensuring we are improving our 

performance on an ongoing basis. 

The Board, led by the Chairman, has 

oversight of sustainability matters 

and receives regular updates on 

important sustainability issues. 

Sustainability topics are further 

discussed and addressed in quarterly 

senior management meetings, where 

representatives from all key areas of 

our operations are present.

Responsibility for the day-to-day 

implementation of sustainability 

is delegated to our Head of 

Sustainability, who reports directly 

to the CEO, and is supported by a 

team of skilled experts from across 

our business. We have integrated 

sustainability throughout our 

management systems, including the 

key performance indicators (KPIs) 

of relevant senior executives and 

other employees with functional 

responsibility at an operational level. 

Operational teams are required to 

provide regular cross-departmental 

updates on key issues – including 

hotspots and fire incidents, the status 

of land clearing, and any incidents 

of conflict with local communities 

– to the regional and corporate 

sustainability teams.

OUR MATERIAL 

SUSTAINABILITY 

TOPICS

[102-15, 102-46, 102-47, 102-49, 103-1]

We use the principle of materiality 

to ensure that we are focused 

on managing and reporting our 

performance against the topics that 

matter most to our stakeholders  

and that are of greatest significance to 

the long-term performance of  

our business.

In 2019, we conducted a new 

assessment of our material 

sustainability topics. This process, 

which was guided by a robust 

stakeholder engagement exercise, 

highlighted new and emerging topics, 

and provided a fresh check on whether 

we are focusing on the right issues.  

Based on the outcomes of the 

assessment, Climate Change, and 

Gender Equality and Inclusion have 

emerged as new sustainability topics 

for First Resources. In addition, 

Business Conduct and Ethics and 

Employee Attraction, Retention and 

Development have increased in relative 

significance from previous assessments. 

Our materiality matrix and details 

of our assessment methodology 

can be found in the Materiality and 

Stakeholder Engagement section of 

this report.

YIELD AND 

EXTRACTION 

IMPROVEMENTS

[103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

As the most versatile vegetable oil, 

palm oil is used in both food and 

non-food products around the 

world. It also has the highest yield 

compared to any alternative oil crops, 

making the most efficient use of the 

land. However, with the increase in 

demand for palm oil, concerns on 

the environmental impacts of the 

industry is also growing, especially in 

relation to the clearing of land  

for plantations. 

Sustainable production is therefore 

crucial to minimising our impact on 

the environment and ensuring the 

long-term success of our business. 

Opportunities for continued growth 

without the need to develop new land 

will come from our ongoing efforts to 

improve yield and extraction rates.

YIELD AND  

EXTRACTION RATES 

At First Resources, we continuously 

seek to improve our yield and 

extraction rates, which are dependent 

on a combination of complex 

factors – including weather and 

changes in climate, pests, soil types, 

as well as agricultural practices 

such as fertilisation and harvesting 

efficiency. To improve our yield as 

well as reduce our reliance on manual 

labour, we employ a number of 

practices including:  

• 

Replanting with our own higher-

yielding planting materials 

developed through research; 

• 

Customised fertilisation by 

plantation blocks to increase the 

effectiveness of fertilisers applied;

• 

Increased mechanisation such 

as the use of a fertiliser spreader, 

empty fruit bunch (EFB) spreader 

and battery-operated herbicide 

sprayers; and

• 

Transportation of fresh fruit 

bunches (FFB) from the field to 

the main road by motorcycles 

instead of wheelbarrows. 

A lower FFB yield was observed in 

2019 compared to the previous year 

due to replanting and a reduction of 

fertiliser application for old plantings 

in preparation for replanting. 

We would expect to see a higher 

FFB yield in 2020 as a result of an 

increase in the percentage of oil palm 

plantings in their prime age. 







S U S T A I N A B I L I T Y  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

We also continued to provide support 

and share best management practices 

with our smallholders to help them 

increase productivity. The decrease 

in smallholder FFB yield compared 

to the previous year was due to 

an increased proportion of older 

plantings in our plasma areas. For 

more information on our engagement 

with smallholder farmers, see the 

section on Supporting Smallholders.

Despite a lower FFB yield in 2019, we 

managed to improve our crude palm 

oil (CPO) extraction rate in 2019 as a 

result of:

• Better FFB quality from an 

increase in field monitoring;

• Increased collection of oil palm 

loose fruits; 

• A reduction in the turnover rate 

of our harvesters compared to 

previous years; and

• An increase in transportation 

efficiency of FFB to mills. 

To cater for the growth in production 

from our maturing plantations in 

Kalimantan, we constructed two 

new mills which began operations 

in 2019. This is expected to further 

enhance production and increase our 

extraction rates in the future. 

RESEARCH AND 

DEVELOPMENT

First Resources has three dedicated 

research and development facilities 

across our operations – the First 

Resources Research Centre based 

in Riau and two research stations in 

West and East Kalimantan. These 

centres focus on innovations in  

yield improvement, the mitigation  

of environmental impacts and  

crop management. 

We have invested in a number 

of breeding programmes aimed 

at developing higher-yielding 

planting material for future planting 

and replanting activities. One of 

our projects involves the use of 

advanced biotechnology, where we 

are collaborating with a university 

partner to research molecular/

DNA marker-assisted oil palm 

breeding selection. The breeding 

programme also aims to develop 

more resilient planting materials that 

can better cope with diseases such as 

Ganoderma, dry weather conditions 

and greater weather fluctuations 

resulting from climate change. 

Another area of focus is to develop 

seed varieties that produce shorter 

and more compact palms. This will 

help to increase workers’ harvesting 

productivity and also enable larger 

palm density per hectare.

Through our replanting programme, 

we have gradually renewed our 

plantations with high-yielding seeds, 

increasing our overall productivity. 

In 2019, we replanted approximately 

1,500 hectares of our old oil palm 

trees, with all of the planting 

materials coming from our own seed 

production unit. The yield estimate 

from these enhanced planting 

materials is more than 20% higher 

than the existing planting materials 

we have been using on the field. 

In March 2019, we also 

commissioned a new tissue culture 

laboratory to produce clonal palms 

using tissue culture. Through this 

laboratory, we hope to be able to 

clone oil palms identified to have 

desired characteristics.

CONSERVATION 

AND FOREST 

MANAGEMENT

[103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

Indonesia contains one of the world’s 

largest area of rainforests which 

houses a rich biodiversity. These 

forests are crucial for maintaining 

a healthy ecosystem and play an 

important role in our fight against 

climate change. We recognise 

that activities of land clearing for 

agriculture may contribute to the loss 

of biodiversity as well as the release of 

stored carbon. As a sustainable palm 

oil company, we play an important 

role in conserving and managing 

forests. Our priorities consist of 

protecting High Conservation Value 

(HCV) areas, including riparian 

zones, as well as High Carbon Stock 

(HCS) forests and peatland.  

IDENTIFYING HCV AREAS 

[304-4]

In line with our Policy on Sustainable 

Palm Oil, First Resources does not 

develop on HCV areas, including 

riparian zones. Following the RSPO 

Principles and Criteria (P&amp;C) and 

the RSPO New Planting Procedures 

(NPP), all new developments are 

subjected to third-party HCV 

assessments undertaken by an expert 

approved under the HCV Assessor 

Licensing Scheme. These assessments 

are available on the Roundtable 

on Sustainable Palm Oil's (RSPO) 

website, and cover habitat quality, soil 

conditions, peat presence, river quality, 

and community cultural identity. 

Based on assessments carried 

out between 2009 and 2017, the 

Group identified approximately 



4,500 hectares of HCV areas which 

are excluded from our oil palm 

plantations’ development plans. 

Through our HCV assessments, 

rare and endangered species were 

identified within our concessions and 

the surrounding areas. For our full list 

of identified threatened species under 

Indonesia’s National Law of Protected 

Species (Indonesian Government 

Regulation No. 92 of 2018), or 

under the International Union for 

Conservation of Nature’s Red List 

(IUCN Red List), see our website.

IDENTIFYING HCS FORESTS

As part of our commitment to halt 

deforestation and retain carbon stores, 

we no longer develop HCS forests as 

defined by the HCS Approach Steering 

Group, and continue to implement 

our broad-based land use planning 

procedure. All new development 

areas are required to undergo HCS 

assessments carried out by third-

party HCS experts.  

A total of 15 HCS assessments 

covering all 110,000 hectares of our 

development bank have been carried 

out between 2015 and 2017 using 

the HCS Toolkit Version 1. These 

assessments took more than two years 

to complete as extensive work was 

required for ground truthing, patch 

analysis and initial consultations 

with local communities. We have 

also conducted Rapid Biodiversity 

Assessment (RBA) for seven of the 

concessions where follow-up analyses 

were necessary. These analyses  

helped to fine-tune the contours of 

our HCS areas. 

S U S T A I N A B I L I T Y  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9

21


ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

In November 2018, a revised RSPO 

P&amp;C was released. Criterion 7.12 of 

the revised RSPO P&amp;C requires that 

new land clearing after 15 November 

2018 must be preceded by a High 

Conservation Value - High Carbon 

Stock Approach (HCV-HCSA) 

assessments. Going forward and 

for any future assessments, First 

Resources will implement the HCV-

HCSA assessment, where required. 

PROTECTING HCV  

AND HCS AREAS 

[304-1, 304-2, 304-3]

We have identified approximately 

20,000 hectares of land as 

conservation areas. These are 

areas with potential HCS, HCV or 

peat content, and have therefore 

been carved out from the Group’s 

development plans, in accordance 

with our policy.

Our ongoing conservation and 

forest protection efforts are mainly 

focused on ensuring internal 

compliance in relation to our 

conservation areas. Prior to any new 

developments, an environmental 

impact assessment (Analisis 

Mengenai Dampak Lingkungan or 

AMDAL) is carried out in accordance 

with local regulations. These new 

developments will also need to 

be approved by our sustainability 

team, who will ensure that the areas 

proposed for development are not 

within conservation areas. Post 

development, our sustainability team 

will conduct checks on the ground 

to ensure that only non-conversation 

areas were cleared. Buffer zones are 

also in place to mitigate the risks 

of accidental non-compliance. In 

addition, our plantation managers  

have key performance indicators 

(KPIs) tied to no development on 

conservation areas. 

We also have a strict policy against 

the hunting, injuring, possessing, 

and killing of rare and endangered 

wildlife within our plantations. Any 

infringement of this policy results 

in disciplinary measures, including 

termination of employment. Besides 

deterrent measures, we also take a 

proactive approach to ensure these 

species are protected, including 

placing signboards at strategic 

locations to highlight conservation 

areas, with daily patrols monitoring 

these areas.

In West Kalimantan, we formed 

conservation taskforces at two of 

our concessions, where the presence 

of orangutans has been identified. 

Through our ongoing partnership 

with a local conservation non-

governmental organisation (NGO), 

the taskforces have been equipped and 

trained to undertake manual HCV 

monitoring, to handle orangutans 

and other wildlife species, and to use 

conservation software tools. Cameras 

have been installed to provide 24-hours 

surveillance, in addition to joint patrols 

between the taskforce and the NGO. 

The teams record their observations 

on the presence of orangutans and 

other wildlife species regularly, and the 

results are subsequently shared with 

our local partner to gather feedback 

for improvements. The taskforces also 

support the rehabilitation of these 

HCV areas. 

A joint survey between First 

Resources and the local NGO was 

carried out in 2018 to study the 

feasibility of building corridors 

to connect HCV areas within a 

concession. From the survey, it was 



F I R S T  R E S O U R C E S  L I M I T E D

22


found that orangutans were crossing 

from the plantation area within 

our concession to a neighbouring 

plantation and vice versa using a 

wooden log as a bridge. Realising 

that this could lead to human-

wildlife conflict in the long term, 

First Resources, together with the 

neighbouring plantation, joined 

forces on a project to build a corridor 

between the forest fragments of 

both companies’ concessions. As 

part of the project, we prepared the 

seedlings and restoration area for tree 

planting in addition to performing 

maintenance activities.  

This year, we conducted a workshop 

on “Biodiversity Conservation as 

a Sustainable Palm Oil Business 

Strategy” at the YIARI Learning 

Centre at Ketapang, West 

Kalimantan. The workshop, which 

was attended by 25 employees 

representing various levels and 

functions from First Resources, 

aimed to strengthen their 

understanding on the importance 

of conservation. Examples of topics 

covered include impacts of oil palm 

plantations to the ecosystem, as 

well as social and economic benefits 

from biodiversity conservation in oil 

palm plantations. In addition to the 

workshop, we have also conducted 

HCV and HCS training for a total of 

32 staff from two concessions in Riau. 

In 2020, we aim to conduct internal 

training on HCV and HCS for nine of 

our plantations.  

In East Kalimantan, we continued our 

partnership with the Research and 

Technology Development Agency 

of the Ministry of Environment and 

Forestry, with the aim of optimising 

the potential of the Lembonah forest, 

which has been set aside as a HCV 

area.  Based on a study conducted 

by a research agency in 2015, a 

recommendation was to explore the 

development of this HCV area into 

a conservation and environmental 

education forest.

Together with the ministry, we 

developed modules on the  

Lembonah Forest and the 

surrounding environment to 

educate tourists and visitors on the 

importance of conserving these  

areas. In February 2019, a module 

was published. 

Not all communities are aware and 

supportive of the HCV and HCS 

concept, and we see this as the 

biggest obstacle to the successful 

conservation of the areas that 

the Group has set aside from 

development. Awareness programmes 

are therefore key to educating the 

communities on the importance of 

protecting the conservation areas. In 

2019, we conducted HCS and HCV 

training for 13 villages, with a total 

of 334 attendees across Riau, West 

Kalimantan and East Kalimantan.  In 

2020, we aim to conduct HCV and 

HCS training for another six villages.   

We also use satellite imagery, updated 

monthly, to detect any land clearing 

activities on the ground. We will 

continue to monitor our concessions 

to ensure no land clearing on HCV 

and HCS areas takes place.

REHABILITATING HCV  

AND HCS AREAS 

[304-3]

Rehabilitation projects are being 

implemented to restore degraded 

HCV and HCS areas back to their 

prior conditions. Restoration work 

commenced in the second half of 

2016 in one of the identified HCV 

areas at PT Limpah Sejahtera, 

which was damaged by fires in 

2015. To date, almost 15,000 forest 

trees have been planted in three of 

our concession areas, covering 43 

hectares. In 2019, some of these 

areas were affected by forest fires, 

dampening our efforts. The source 

of fires originated from outside of 

our concession. Going forward, we 

are putting in place further measures 

to mitigate future risks of fires. For 

more details on these efforts, see the 

section on Fire Prevention. 

Reforestation and rehabilitation 

work also remain a challenge as 

suitable tree species are required to 

be identified for specific areas due to 

differences in growth conditions such 

as soil type.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

To prevent the deterioration of 

HCV areas, we monitor the number, 

stratum, and species of flora and 

fauna in selected plots and assign a 

corresponding biodiversity index. 

The index is reviewed yearly to 

assess if our HCV management 

and monitoring efforts have 

been adequate or require further 

improvement. In 2020, we will 

continue to rehabilitate approximately 

26 hectares of HCV area within three 

of our concessions. 

PEAT MANAGEMENT 

[103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

Since the introduction of our Policy 

on Sustainable Palm Oil in 2015, and 

in line with our “No Deforestation, 

No Peat and No Exploitation” 

(NDPE) commitment, we will not 

carry out any new plantings on 

peatland at any depth. 

Our specialised peat taskforce, 

established as part of our fire 

prevention and management 

strategy for peatland, focuses on 

conducting detailed peat surveys 

and peat assessments in our estates. 

The taskforce is led by our research 

and development department and 

supported by our agronomy and 

sustainability department. The 

taskforce has undergone training 

conducted by experienced personnel, 

to ensure that they are equipped with 

the necessary skills and up-to-date 

on best practices. The results from 

the peat surveys are being used for 

our land use planning and to enhance 

the water management plans of our 

plantations on peat. As of 2019, a 

total of 20 peat surveys have been 

conducted. 

For our existing plantations on peat, we 

implement best management practices, 

such as ensuring groundwater levels 

are maintained at optimal levels to 

minimise peat subsidence and to 

minimise the release of carbon dioxide. 

To monitor water tables, we have 

installed piezometers and automatic 

data loggers at our plantations to record 

data every 12 hours. 

To regulate and manage water levels, 

we have also blocked canals and 

built water gates at selected estates in 

accordance with the guidelines of the 

Indonesian Ministry of Environment 

and Forestry, and Indonesian Peatland 

Restoration Agency. We have also 

been updating the two government 

agencies regularly on our progress 

in peatland management. Between 

2017 and 2019, we revised the 

canal blocking design for 11 estates 

due to changes in environmental 

conditions. Adjustments to the 

canal blocking at these estates are 

ongoing. Going forward, we will 

also be working with the ministry to 

monitor nine of our estates. We will 

be performing routine measurement 

of water table in the field, installing 

a piezometer in every block of 

planted area and installing peat 

subsidence measurement pole for 

peat drainability assessment. 

Peat drainability assessments will be 

conducted at planted areas on peat 

five years prior to any replanting. 

We also continue to report and work 

with the ministry to ensure that all 

our estates are in compliance with 

any new directives issued by the 

Indonesian government on  

water management of existing  

peat plantations.

FIRE PREVENTION  

[103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

At First Resources, we follow a 

strict Zero Burning policy for land 

clearing in all new developments and 

future replanting. This policy is also 

socialised with our suppliers who 

are made aware that any deliberate 

breach may result in an immediate 

termination of contract. 

Launched in 2016, our Integrated 

Fire Management (IFM) programme 

comprises in-depth workplan for fire 

prevention, preparedness, response 

and recovery. Both our corporate 

headquarters and regional operations 

teams are heavily involved in the 

implementation of the workplan. 

Two important aspects of the IFM 

programme is the identification of 

high-risk and high-priority areas 

as well as ensuring that essential 

fire-fighting facilities are in working 

order. Each estate has a Peta Rawan 

Kebakaran (Fire Prone Map) 

mapping out risk areas and facilities 

available. These facilities include 

roads, patrol paths, fire equipment 

store, fire lookout tower, water 

reservoirs/sources and warning signs. 

Location of villages and important 

telephone numbers are also noted on 

the Fire Prone Map.

In addition to strengthening our 

IFM programme, we also work 

with external stakeholders such as 

the RSPO who actively detects fire 

hotspots within RSPO members 

concessions. This provides an 

additional source of alerts aside 

from our own internal fire hotspot 

monitoring. In 2019, based on fire 

hotspot data from RSPO, 47 fire 

incidences within our concessions  

were identified. 

Our fire prevention activities include 

installing warning signs at strategic 

locations, building fire lookout towers 

educating the community, creating 

firebreaks and deploying routine fire 

patrols during fire prone season. The 

patrol teams update the management 

on any fire occurrences and in case 

any facilities are in non-working 

conditions. In peat areas, we create 

firebreaks, prepare water reservoirs/

sources, build canal blockings and 

implement water management 

practices. During the dry season, we 

take further precautions by increasing 

the water levels in the peat area to 

prevent incoming fire and/or prevent 

fire from spreading.

We have more than 1,400 firefighters 

assigned within our operations to

ensure fires are handled swiftly and 

adequately. In 2019, we provided 

refresher trainings to approximately 

220 firefighters through a series 

of programmes conducted across 

our mills and estates in Riau, West 

Kalimantan and East Kalimantan. 

We have also tested the use of 

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) 

in one region to assess the extent of 

a burnt area. This method is useful 

for verification and is much faster 

compared to ground-truthing. Going 

forward, we will evaluate the feasibility 

of using UAV and the possibility of 

deploying it to other regions.  

Given the complexity of varying 

land rights in Indonesia, it is not 

uncommon that communities live 

in or within close proximity to our 

concession areas. Fire incidents 

within these areas are mainly caused 

by illegal burning activities, carried 

out by communities who engage 

in small-scale farming. As part of 

our IFM programme, we have been 

engaging local communities, with 

the cooperation of the relevant 

authorities, to raise awareness about 

fire risks and prevention. We also 

include them in our fire training 

sessions where they learn about fire 

management practices and alternative 

land clearing methods. In 2019, we 

have trained around 350 community 

members from 16 villages in fire 

prevention and management. Being 

able to reach out to all communities 

remain a challenge.

FIRE MONITORING AND PREVENTION EFFORTS 

In 2020, we plan to reach out to another nine villages on fire prevention and management as well as increase our

We make use of satellite monitoring which are 

conducted daily by overlapping hotspots captured 

by the satellite with our concession maps to keep 

track of the situation on the ground.

C

Once hotspots are detected, on-the-ground 

verification is carried out, including checks for the 

presence of smoke from fire lookout towers and 

sending fire-fighting teams to the affected areas. The 

towers are also important to assess fire conditions 

(e.g. movement of fire, size of fire). We also work 

closely with the RSPO on any hotspots detected.

In the case of a fire breakout, the 

firefighting team will be mobilised

High, and Extreme, depending on humidity, rain 

and fuel conditions. Fire risk levels are clearly and 

prominently displayed in fire prone areas during 

the hot and dry season to remind workers to be 

vigilant. Depending on the FDI level, there will be 

routine patrol teams. During severe conditions, 

patrol teams will bring along fire extinguishing 

equipment to extinguish any fire found.

CLIMATE CHANGE

[103-1, 103-2, 103-3]  

Climate change is considered 

one of the world’s most pressing 

environmental issues. As a palm 

oil company, we are not only at 

risk in terms of the impacts that 

extreme weather events might have 

on our productivity, but also from 

regulatory changes as we transition 

to a low carbon economy. To play our 

part, we are committed to reducing 

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 

from land use change through forest 

conservation and fire prevention. 

We are also putting in place plans 

to reduce GHG emissions at our 

facilities, including emissions from 

palm oil mill effluent (POME) and 

exploring opportunities to ensure the 

physical resilience of our business 

against the impacts of climate change. 

REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM 

LAND USE CHANGE 

One of the biggest contributors of 

GHG emissions in the production of 

palm oil comes from land use change, 

particularly through the clearance 

of peatland and HCS forests. To 

avoid the release of stored carbon 

into the atmosphere, we do not 

undertake any new developments 

on HCS forests or peat areas at 

any depth. For more details on our 

approach to conserving HCS forests 

and peatland management, see the 

section on Conservation and Forest 

Management.

REDUCING EMISSIONS 

THROUGH METHANE 

CAPTURE 

[305-5]

Another significant source of GHG 

emissions comes from POME, which 

is wastewater from the processing 

of fresh fruit bunches (FFB). If left 

untreated, POME emits methane, a 

potent GHG. As part of our GHG 

emissions reduction plans, we have 

been establishing methane capture 

facilities which flare or convert 

the biogas to alternative sources of 

electricity for our operations. 

We have operational methane  

capture facilities at three of our mills. 

These facilities allow POME to be 

treated in a closed system where 

methane is captured, compared to 

open ponds where the gas is  

released into the atmosphere. 

Based on the International 

Sustainability Carbon Certification 

(ISCC) calculation methodology, 

the estimated reduction in GHG 

emissions for each facility is 

approximately 0.51 tonne of CO2e for 

each tonne of CPO produced.

 In 2019, the three facilities 

collectively helped the Group 

to reduce GHG emissions by 

approximately 81,000 tonnes of CO2e. 

This is equivalent to emissions from 

the electricity use of approximately 

13,700 homes in one year1. In the 

same year, we also installed new 

methane capture facilities at two 

mills, and plan to install an additional 

facility in 2020. 

MEASURING OUR FOOTPRINT

Due to system issues which could 

not be resolved at the time of writing 

this report, we were not able to use 

the RSPO PalmGHG calculator 

version 4, the latest version. Our 

GHG emissions for 2019 are therefore 

calculated using the RSPO PalmGHG 

calculator version 3.0.1. We will use 

the latest version in the next report.

The GHG data included in this 

report represents only our mills 

that are RSPO certified. The total 

GHG emissions of a mill is obtained 

through the summation of emissions 

from the mill, supplying own and 

group plantations, and non-group 

plantations including third party 

plantations and smallholders. For 

plantations not owned by the group, 

a reference emission value can be 

used. The reference value can be

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

obtained from research, national 

value or based on the emission value 

of another plantation, for instance, 

own plantation.

In 2019, the GHG emissions intensity 

of PT Meridan Sejati Surya Plantation 

(MSSP), a mill integrated with 

plantation, increased sharply. This is 

due to First Resources now having 

the majority ownership of four 

estates which supply FFB to the mill. 

Previously, these four estates were 

affiliated companies as the Group 

owned a minority interest in them. 

Instead of using a reference emission 

value as we have done in the previous 

year, we now have complete and 

robust dataset of the four estates, and 

is able to calculate the actual GHG 

emissions of the four estates. 

With the updated data, the 

proportion of GHG emissions by 

source has changed as well. While 

land conversion remains a significant 

source of GHG emission, peat 

oxidation and nitrous oxide (N2O) 

emission account for the big increase 

in total carbon emissions.

To reduce the amount of emissions 

from plantations developed on 

peat soil, we continue to employ 

best management practices such as 

maintaining optimal groundwater 

levels.  For more information on  

how we are managing our peat  

lands, see the section on  

Peat Management.

MANAGING PHYSICAL RISKS 

FROM CLIMATE CHANGE  

As an agribusiness, changes in 

weather patterns resulting from 

climate change have the potential to 

affect our yield and productivity. We 

are currently exploring opportunities 

to ensure the physical resilience of 

our business. Part of our breeding 

programme includes developing 

more resilient planting materials 

that can cope with dry weather 

conditions and greater weather 

fluctuations resulting from climate 

change. For more information on 

our programmes, see the section on 

Research and Development.

WATER AND WASTE 

MANAGEMENT

[103-1]

The sustainable use of natural 

resources for production processes 

is instrumental to safeguarding 

the health of our planet. As an 

agribusiness, water is a critical 

resource, not only for the maintenance 

of our crops and to generate steam 

for processing, but also in other areas 

such as the well-being of our workers. 

We are therefore committed to 

using water responsibly, minimising 

our consumption, recycling where 

possible and preventing the pollution 

of waterways. We are also committed 

to the efficient use of other  

resources and aim to reuse, recover 

and recycle the waste produced by 

our operations.

WATER MANAGEMENT 

[103-2, 103-3] 

Most of the water we use is for the 

processing of fresh fruit bunches 

(FFB) at our mills. All of the water 

used for our milling operations is 

drawn from rivers and we do not 

use groundwater. In 2019, we have 

implemented more robust controls 

to monitor the use of water, and 

where possible, reduce the amount 

of water used. To reduce the amount 

of water drawn from the rivers, 

water from the cooler turbines, and 

sludge condensate from the steriliser 

is recycled. Water from sludge 

condensate is also fully recycled for 

water dilution in the operation of 

mills. A total of 941,974 cubic metres 

of wastewater was recycled in 2019. 

In addition to mill usage, we also 

draw water for nursery irrigation and 

household use. All water used for our 

plantations are 100% rain-fed.  

In 2019, we updated our water 

consumption calculation 

methodology, which now includes 

water drawn from the rivers that are 

treated and not treated for use. Our 

water consumption intensity target 

remains at 1.0 cubic metres per tonne 

of FFB processed for all our mills. 

WASTE AND EFFLUENTS 

MANAGEMENT 

[103-2, 103-3]  

Our approach to managing waste 

and effluents is guided by agronomic 

best practices to minimise our 

environmental impact.  

The main waste products from the 

milling process include organic 

solid plantation waste such as EFB, 

fibres, shells and POME, which are 

predominantly reused, recovered  

and recycled. 

EFB is applied as mulch in the 

plantations to conserve moisture 

in soil, improve soil fertility, and 

reduce weed growth. Fibres and 

shells are used to generate power in 

our palm oil mills and refineries. Oil 

palm trunks from replanting and oil 

palm fronds from field upkeep are 

left in the plantations to decompose 

naturally, acting as fertiliser. We will 

continue to ensure that the bulk of 

our organic waste generated is reused. 

Non-hazardous waste generated 

downstream such as filter bags and 

cartridges are collected and disposed 

by local licensed waste collectors.

To minimise effluent discharge, 

POME generated is repurposed 

as organic fertiliser which reduces 

our need for commercial fertilisers. 

For land application, the biological 

oxygen demand (BOD) level is kept 

below the legal threshold of 5,000 

milligrams per litre.

PEST MANAGEMENT 

AND CHEMICAL 

USAGE

[103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

First Resources uses chemicals to 

protect crops from pests and diseases 

as well as maintain high yields. 

Without proper management, the use 

of such chemicals may pose a risk to 

workers and the environment. We 

are therefore committed to adopting 

agronomic best practices. 

INTEGRATED PEST 

MANAGEMENT 

Our integrated pest management 

strategy includes a combination 

of biological controls as well as 

good agricultural practices such as 

selecting the right pesticides and 

controlling dosage. 

Barn owls (Tyto alba) are used 

in our plantations to control the 

rat population. We currently 

have breeding projects in Riau 

and Kalimantan to increase the 

population of barn owls in our young 

estates. We also plant beneficial plants 

such as Cassia cobanensis, Antigonon 

leptopus, and Turnera subulata, which 

attract predators of oil palm leaf-

eating pests such as bagworms and 

nettle caterpillars. Other biological 

agent such as Cordyceps fungus is 

also used during outbreaks of pests 

(nettle caterpillars). We also use 

Trichoderma as a bio-fungicide to 

control Ganoderma. 

We monitor the usage of our 

pesticides and ensure they are 

permitted by the Ministry of 

Agriculture in Indonesia. Different 

types of pesticides with different 

purposes are available in either 

solid or liquid form, and the usage 

depends on requirements. Some 

pesticides are also used in the form 

of pre-formulated mixtures and 

their classification is set by the 

manufacturer as per the World Health 

Organisation’s (WHO) guidelines. 

We only use the WHO’s Class 1A or 

1B pesticides in specific and urgent 

situations such as during a bagworm 

outbreak as biological methods will 

not be effective. Adequate safety 

measures such as the use of personal 

protective equipment (PPE) are put 

in place to prevent any long-term 

health issues for our workers when 

using Class 1 chemicals.  

Paraquat Phase-out

To address concerns from 

stakeholders on the high toxicity 

levels and the potential of misusing 

paraquat, we have started with trials 

on alternative pesticides which 

have shown promising results. We 

have reduced our use of paraquat 

significantly in 2019, and aim to 

phase-out its use by 2020. In the 

meantime, we continue to ensure  

that adequate safety measures are 

in place to prevent any accidents or 

long-term damage taking place from 

paraquat use.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT



FERTILISER USAGE

The use of fertilisers in the field varies 

depending on total new plantings as 

well as the total hectarage of mature 

plantations, with oil palm plantings 

in their prime-yielding age requiring 

a higher input of nutrients. 

While there is currently a higher 

proportion of inorganic fertiliser 

application on our younger planting 

profile, an overall reduction in 

proportion is observed for plantations 

with a more mature profile. We 

expect our chemical usage for crop 

protection and maintenance to 

diminish as our younger plantations

reach maturity. We have also put in 

place procedures and guidelines to 

allow adequate intervals between 

fertiliser applications and to avoid 

applying fertilisers during periods 

of heavy rain to minimise runoff. 

In order to protect buffer zones, we 

have developed internal standard 

operating procedures which prevent 

fertilisers and chemicals to be applied 

on these areas.

We aim to use organic fertilisers 

derived from waste products to the 

maximum extent possible. 95% of 

our POME and EFB are currently 

reused as organic fertilisers in the 

field. We are currently conducting 

research and trials to increase the 

accuracy of fertiliser application 

for our plantations, ensuring their 

optimum use. This also includes 

fine-tuning recommendations for 

different areas which may have 

different requirements due to terrain 

and soil type, as well as zones with 

microclimates.   

Going forward, we aim to continue 

improving on fertiliser use by 

conducting site specific assessments 

on manuring programmes and 

encouraging the implementation of 

the “4 Rights” in manuring (right 

source, right dosage, right time, and 

right place).

Workers who handle chemicals 

within our operations are required 

to undergo regular trainings which 

are conducted by field, research and 

development staff, learning centres 

and by the chemical vendors. The 

training scope includes handling 

of packaging, making chemicals 

solutions from concentrate, using the 

applicator and evaluating the success 

rate of application. We also ensure 

that adequate PPEs are provided and 

used on site. First Resources does 

not use chemicals listed under the 

Stockholm or Rotterdam Conventions.

RIGHTS OF 

INDIGENOUS 

AND LOCAL 

COMMUNITIES

[103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

The palm oil sector is a major 

contributor to the Indonesian 

economy, lifting rural 

communities out of poverty 

through the creation of jobs and 



through the provision of important 

infrastructure. We recognise that if 

not handled properly, the acquisition 

of land for the development of new 

plantations may undermine the rights 

of local indigenous communities and 

negatively impact their livelihoods. 

To maintain positive relations with 

the communities where we operate, 

First Resources is committed to 

upholding the rights of indigenous 

and local populations through 

constructive engagements. We also 

contribute to the socio-economic 

development of our neighbouring 

communities through our 

community investment initiatives. 

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT 

[413-1, 413-2]

We conduct social impact 

assessments in all new areas that we 

plan to develop. This enables us to 

understand the potential impacts 

of our operations on communities. 

The results of these assessments 

guide us in our engagement with 

communities and our planning and 

implementation of programmes to 

help mitigate the negative changes 

that may result from our operations. 

As part of our Policy on Sustainable 

Palm Oil, we have made the 

commitment to respect the rights of 

indigenous and local communities 

to give or withhold their Free, Prior 

and Informed Consent (FPIC) for 

the utilisation of land to which 

they hold legal or customary rights. 

Should a conflict or grievance arise, 

we ensure that these are resolved with 

local communities through an open, 

transparent and consultative manner.

 

Land Compensation

The processes to settle land rights 

and compensation are extremely 

complex in Indonesia, guided by 

multi-layered national and provincial 

laws and procedures. Customary 

and indigenous land claims may 

be undefined and conflicting with 

the current legal context. The 

identification of land ownership 

can also be a challenge due to 

the common practice of shifting 

cultivations. 

Upon being granted a location permit 

(Ijin lokasi) for a new development, 

we will first identify the land that 

belongs to individuals within the 

local community. This is followed by 

a socialisation process which usually 

covers various key aspects designed 

to inform the communities about:

• 

The company’s permit granted by 

the government;

• 

The government’s and company’s 

land compensation policies;

• 

The development plans;

• 

The approach for land 

measurement;

• 

Land valuation approaches; and

• 

The process for verifying land 

ownership and the requirements 

for proof of ownership.

Following socialisation and the 

completion of due diligence, 

compensation is made to 

communities who have accepted the 

company’s offer for their land. All 

land transfers are documented and 

witnessed by members of the local 

government and community leaders.

Conflict Resolution 

[411-1]

We are committed to ensuring that 

all new developments follow the 

principles of FPIC, with the ultimate 

aim of zero land conflicts surfacing in 

the future.

Land disputes involving rightful 

land ownership are amongst the 

most common form of conflicts 

that we come across. Our grievance 

procedure, detailed in Our Approach 

to Sustainability section of this 

report, allows stakeholders to raise 

grievances. We are committed to 

resolving conflicts in a responsive 

manner and through a process that 

is fair and transparent. In 2019, 

we had no new cases involving

land conflict. The past three cases 

involving land conflicts, two of which 

were registered on the Roundtable 

on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) 

complaints log, have been closed.  For 

more information, see our grievance 

list available on our website. 

COMMUNITY 

INVESTMENT

[103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 203-1, 203-2]

We employ a large proportion of our 

workforce from local communities, 

which are often located in isolated 

areas that lack basic infrastructure 

and services. We are therefore 

committed to driving positive 

socio-economic impact for the 

people and communities where we 

operate through not only job creation 

but also community development 

programmes centred on education, 

healthcare and infrastructure. 

Our Community Development 

Officers (CDOs) are the main 

liaison between our company and 

community members. CDOs engage 

with local residents on a regular basis 

to build relationships and understand 

community members’ ambitions, 

concerns and needs. A CDO’s typical 

task includes collecting data on living 

conditions and population numbers, 

brainstorming new development 

ideas with community members, 

designing and proposing new 

programmes to regional managers 

and sustainability coordinators, and 

implementing local projects. CDOs 

also act as ambassadors, engaging 

with local government agencies to 

present and explain First Resources’ 

operational activities, environmental 

initiatives and social programmes.

EDUCATION

First Resources recognises that 

education is fundamental for the 

growth and well-being of our 

communities. We are therefore 

working to increase access to quality 

formal education for both the current 

and future generations of children. 

We currently manage 38 schools 

located within our oil palm estates. 



These include two preschools, 14 

kindergartens, 19 elementary schools 

and three junior high schools. These 

institutions employ more than 300 

teachers and educate more than 

5,500 students. The educational 

practices adopted are similar to those 

at schools managed by the local 

government. The Group contributes 

to the schools’ facilities and teaching 

aids, such as furniture, computers, 

electricity generators and books. 

All children of employees working 

in our estates are provided with 

free education at our schools. 

Scholarships were awarded to high-

scoring children from less privileged 

families, having been selected by 

local education authorities. To 

motivate teachers that work with 

our communities, and encourage 

a higher standard of teaching, we 

offer them additional incentives, 

such as supplementary income. In 

2019, we allocated and invested 

more than IDR3.8 billion to support 

the education of children. Based 

on a pilot audit conducted by our 

customer Neste, it was found that a 

number of children within an estate 

in Riau dropped out or were not 

attending school. To understand 

F I R S T  R E S O U R C E S  L I M I T E D

38


the reasons for this, we conducted 

a survey in 2019. It was found that 

some children did not attend school 

due to their parents’ lack of awareness 

on the importance of education, 

the distance to the schools from 

their home, age gaps with their 

classmates and the need to help their 

parents at home. In order to address 

these issues, we engaged with the 

children’s families to raise awareness 

on the importance of education and 

provided school items such as school 

uniforms and books. As a result of 

this initiative, approximately 35% of 

the children we reached out to agreed 

to attend school again. The majority 

who did not want to attend school 

were teenagers who felt conscious 

about the age gap with the younger 

children. We will continue to raise 

awareness on the importance of 

education and encourage all children 

to go to school. 

The Group has also established 

an internship programme that is 

run in collaboration with more 

than 30 Indonesian universities. 

The programme offers students an 

opportunity to apply what they have 

learned at university, expand their 

knowledge and benefit from valuable 

on-the-job experience. In 2019, we 

have taken in 80 interns, consisting 

of students from various universities 

and high schools.

HEALTHCARE

We have a total of 32 health clinics 

within our estates. These are staffed 

with qualified medical professionals, 

including at least one doctor and two 

nurses in each facility. The primary 

purpose of the clinics is to service our 

employees and their families, but they 

healthcare facilities, educational 

facilities and markets. Before 

undertaking infrastructure projects, 

First Resources will consult local 

village leaders to better understand 

the needs of the community. 

The roads servicing our operating 

areas, which we share with local 

communities, are maintained 

to minimise disruptions to our 

operations as well as to maintain 

strong links to the main transport 

network.  In 2019, we repaired 23.5 

kilometres of roads as well as two 

bridges in Riau. 

ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER

Infrastructure for delivering clean 

and potable water is severely lacking 

in some of the communities located 

near our operations. Recognising 

this as a basic need, our past efforts 

include providing clean water, new 

piping and water tanks, as well as 

the construction of new water wells 

for villages. This has enabled the 

communities to access clean water for 

drinking and other household needs.

are also open to local community 

members. The operating hours of 

our clinics are longer than those of 

the health posts managed by local 

government. Medical services such 

as immunisations for polio, measles 

and tuberculosis are available to 

communities upon request. 

We have also established health-

related community programmes 

to improve the wellbeing of local 

residents and increase their  

awareness about the benefits of 

healthy living. Carried out in 

collaboration with local health 

authorities, the “Be Healthy with 

First Resources” programme includes 

treatments and advice for children, 

pregnant women and the elderly, as 

well as the coordination of blood 

donation drives.

INFRASTRUCTURE 

In addition to enabling us to run 

our operations more efficiently, a 

better infrastructure system helps 

to increase the mobility of local 

communities, enabling access to

EMPLOYEE PROFILE 

[102-7, 102-8]

We directly employ 20,913 employees 

across our offices, plantations, mills 

and processing plants, 18,322 of 

which are permanent employees and 

2,591 are contract employees.

To maintain efficient operations, 

some of our workers, including 

seasonal workers, security guards and 

those needed for special construction 

projects, are sourced through third 

party contractors. Other seasonal 

workers are contracted during peak 

harvesting seasons. In these cases, 

workers are sometimes the wives of 

male workers, or workers located 

nearby our operations who prefer 

not to be bound to a company as it 

provides them with the flexibility to 

engage in other work.

Our new hires and turnover rates can 

be attributed mainly to harvesters. 

With many employers to choose 

from, harvesters tend to prefer 

plantations with younger and shorter 

oil palm trees, as the work is less 

strenuous and risky. 

Harvesting work is also dependent  

on peak crop season which tends  

to impact the new hire and  

turnover rates, unlike other jobs  

such as herbicide spraying and 

fertiliser application, which have a 

more predictable schedule.

Due to a tough year in 2019, there were 

also less new hires and job positions 

which were replaced. The decrease in 

contract workers engaged was also due 

to lower production during the year as 

well as the mechanisation of some of 

our field activities.

EMPLOYEE RELATIONS  

AND WORKPLACE

FAIR WAGES AND  

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 

[401-2, 409-1] 

First Resources has implemented 

a salary structure such that the 

lowest wage paid is in line with the 

minimum wage regulated by the 

respective province or district. Wages 

are regularly updated based on new 

guidelines or revisions to the relevant 

existing agreements according to the 

Regulation (Peraturan Pemerintah) 

No. 78 year 2015.

In 2019, we conducted an  

internal labour and human rights  

assessment for two to three of 

our estates in each region. Issues 

that were looked into include 

compensation practices such 

as payslip standardisation and 

overtime incentives, implementation 

of a proper workers’ agreement, 

awareness on collective bargaining 

and grievance mechanisms, as well as  

the importance of children's education. 

We acknowledge that groundwork 

conditions vary depending on 

the environment. For example, 

hilly terrains will require more 

time to reach the same work target 

compared to an environment with 

flat terrains. We therefore conducted 

a comprehensive time-motion study 

for wages which takes into account 

working conditions to ensure fair 

compensation. 

We keep records of all salaries paid to 

our employees and contractors. These 

records are acknowledged by the 

payees and clarification is provided to 

ensure that they understand how the 

payments have been calculated. 

Based on the labour and human 

rights assessment conducted in 2019, 

improvements were made to payslips 

provided to workers by ensuring they 

are standardised and contain the 

necessary information. The payslips 

were also restructured to make it 

easier for the workers to understand.  

We also provide additional benefits 

to our permanent employees. These 

benefits include life and health 

insurance coverage and an annual 

bonus which is determined by 

the individual's and the Group’s 

performance. 

We aim to house all our plantation 

and mill employees and their 

families in a safe and healthy living 

environment in our estates. Through 

our programme called “17 Kehidupan 

Pondok”, we identified 17 areas of 

needs for workers living on estates, 

including access to purchasing 

provisions as well as facilities and 

amenities that meet their needs. In 

addition to housing and sanitation, 

employees also have access to 

running water, electricity, medical 

care, sports and recreational facilities, 

and places of worship. Educational 

facilities for employees’ children, 

such as kindergartens and primary 

schools, day care centres, and school 

buses are also provided.

TRAINING AND 

DEVELOPMENT 

[404-2] 

Every year, the First Resources 

Learning Centre assesses the 

training needs of our employees. 

Training is prioritised in line with 

the Group’s business and operational 

requirements. We have established 

regular training programmes that 

include field assistant training, mill 

assistant training, administration 

assistant training, and foreman 

training. Non-regular training 

programmes are also provided 

on topics such as harvesting 

management, fertilising management, 

e-plantation systems, seven tools 

management, problem solving and 

decision making. Training is  

provided by First Resources’ 

coaches and specialist vendors, 

while continual on-the-job training 

and mentorships are provided by 

managers and supervisors. 

Our Learning Centre also runs five 

graduate training programmes, 

for field assistants, palm oil mill 

assistants and administration 

assistants. Spanning five to six 

months, these programmes cover 

the technical, managerial and 

interactive skills required to work 

in First Resources’ estates and palm 

oil mills. As part of our recruitment 

drive, we have formed partnerships 

with universities in Java and 

Sumatra to provide internships for 

undergraduates and vocational school 

students. Our internship programme 

exposes students to administrative 

duties, plantation activities and 

palm oil mill operations. Apart 

from allowing students to gain 

experience with the company, the 

internship programme also provides 

an opportunity for us to identify 

potential candidates for a permanent 

role in the future. 

As part of our efforts to retain and 

develop high potential employees 

as future leaders of the company, 

First Resources has developed a 

career path system to offer different 

progression tracks. This is to 

ensure that all employees have 

the opportunity to develop at a 

pace that is suitable for them and 

employees with higher ambitions 

and performance can progress 

faster. Employee performance is 

assessed annually through our People 

Development Review. 

Through a more structured  

career progression path, employees’ 

competencies are better developed 

and career planning within a vertical 

career path is facilitated. However, 

this does not limit the career scope 

of an employee as horizontal career 

paths between departments can 

also take place. This approach is 

expected to help us maintain a  

highly competent, motivated and 

engaged workforce.

GENDER EQUALITY 

AND INCLUSION

[103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

Women play a critical role in 

agricultural growth in developing 

countries but continue to face a 

number of constraints that limit their 

inclusion in the sector. Employment 

in plantations has been male 

dominated for a long time, due to 

the physical nature of work and 

deep-rooted cultural norms that 

men are the bread winners, while 

women have larger roles to play at 

home. As a result of these norms, 

women have had less access than 

men to resources and opportunities, 

including land, financial services 

and education.  At First Resources, 

we are committed to providing job 

opportunities based on competence, 

skills and experience, regardless of 

gender, ethnicity, race or religion. In 

2019, we conducted a training session 

in one of our plantations, to nurture 

a work environment that is safe 

and respectful. The training raised 

awareness on gender discrimination, 

such as stereotyping of women in 

specific roles, and covered general 

workplace conduct, including no 

harassment and discrimination.   

Nevertheless, due to the manual 

nature of oil palm cultivation and 

processing, most of our plantation 

and mill workers are men. Male 

workers are typically assigned heavier 

physical tasks, for example harvesting 

and carrying fresh fruit bunches 

(FFB) to trucks for transportation. 

Women are typically assigned tasks 

such as weeding, fertilising and the 

collection of oil palm loose fruits that 

have fallen to the ground.

LABOUR 

CONDITIONS AND 

HUMAN RIGHTS

[103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

Labour and human rights issues in 

the palm oil industry especially in 

supply chains, remain an industry-

wide challenge. At First Resources, we 

prohibit the use of forced, trafficked 

or child labour and respect the 

workplace rights of all our employees, 

including contract workers. This is 

also expected of the suppliers we 

work with. 

A pilot audit of our workers’ 

living and working conditions was 

conducted in Riau by one of our 

customers, Neste. Based on the audit 

results, we conducted a training in 

2019 for our staff and workers to raise 

awareness on respecting workers’ 

and women's rights. For more details, 

see section on Gender Equality and 

Inclusion. Some items are still work 

in progress, especially in areas where 

it involves a third-party agent (for 

casual workers) and areas where 

it takes time to change a cultural 

preference and practice. 

FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION 

AND COLLECTIVE 

BARGAINING 

[102-41]

We support the freedom of all 

our employees to form unions as 

a channel to communicate their 

expectations and aspirations. Our 

labour union is part of the Workers’ 

Union Confederation (KSPSI).  

Each subsidiary and its labour 

union representatives have agreed 

on a Collective Labour Agreement 

that aims to protect employees’ and 

employer's rights and obligations.  

All our employees are protected by 

the Collective Labour Agreement, 

which covers industrial relations, 

working hours, remuneration,  

out-of-post assignments and 

transfers, social security and welfare, 

occupational health and safety, and 

employment termination.

As part of the assessment we 

conducted on labour and human 

rights in 2019, we also took the 

opportunity to socialise and improve 

the workers’ awareness on the 

collective labour agreement.

We hold focus group discussions and 

meetings together with labour unions 

at least once a year. These dialogues 

enable us to take into consideration 

the aspirations of our employees  

and solicit their suggestions, inputs 

and criticisms. 

Employees are also able to convey 

their aspirations through the human 

resources department. The Group 

communicates all changes related to 

employment via emails, circulars, or 

our internal portal.

FORCED OR COMPULSORY 

LABOUR, AND CHILD LABOUR 

[408-1, 409-1]

In accordance with national labour 

laws and regulations, the Group  

does not tolerate forced or bonded 

labour, or the employment of under-

aged workers. 

For our plantation and mill 

operations, we ensure that employees 

are never subject to the unlawful 

withholding of wages, identification 

cards, passports or other travel 

documents. Where we have 

outsourced our manpower needs to 

external agencies, we have briefed 

these middlemen of our policies and 

practices. We will cease working with 

agencies found to be in breach. 

Our recruitment policies, work 

practices and procedures ensure that 

all employees are above 18 years of 

age, and that they understand their 

rights and obligations. We actively 

monitor that children do not assist 

their parents in our estates, as this 

practice is common in many parts  

of Indonesia. We also put up 

signboards to remind parents 

not to bring their children to the 

plantations, socialise the importance 

of education and provide facilities 

such as child-care centres and 

schools. Constant reminders are  

sent to all workers and warnings  

are issued to those who violate  

our policies.

EMPLOYEE RELATIONS  

AND WORKPLACE

OCCUPATIONAL 

HEALTH AND 

SAFETY

[103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 403-1]

We are committed to providing a safe 

and healthy working environment 

for all our employees. To reduce the 

risks of health and safety incidents 

within our operations, we have 

implemented an Occupational Health 

and Safety (OHS) Management 

System across our estates, covering 

all our employees. Workers are 

consulted on the development of the 

management system which is based 

on the Occupational Health and 

Safety Assessment Series standard 

(OHSAS 18001), and complies with 

local regulation requirements. 

PROTECTING OUR PEOPLE 

[403-2, 403-3, 403-4, 403-5, 403-6, 

403-7]

Our Health &amp; Safety Committees 

which meets at least once every three 

months, comprises management and 

staff representatives. The committee 

is responsible for identifying and 

evaluating potential hazards, 

recommending corrective actions, 

following up on implemented 

recommendations, providing 

employees with education and 

training, and developing a grievance 

mechanism. The quality of our risk 

assessments are validated during 

external audits conducted by the 

Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil 

(RSPO) and Indonesia Sustainable 

Palm Oil (ISPO). 

Health and safety topics are discussed 

with employees during daily morning 

meetings. In addition, we have OHS 

manuals and procedures, working 

instructions, emergency response 

drills and other activities to ensure 

all employees are aware of the health 

and safety risks related to their 

jobs. OHS considerations are also 

incorporated into the Collective 

Labour Agreement with the workers’ 

union. These include provisions 

for equipping estate workers with 

personal protective equipment (PPE) 

and the establishment of Health &amp; 

Safety Committees. We also maintain 

an Emergency Response Team on 

standby to attend to any immediate 

health and safety-related crisis. 

When a work-related accident occurs, 

first aid would be administered to 

the injured. If necessary, the injured 

party would be sent to the nearest 

clinic or hospital for treatment and 

monitored for progress. We will then 

investigate and prepare an accident 

report within 48 hours. Following 

the evaluation, corrective actions 

and preventive measures will be 

implemented to prevent the accident 

from re-occurring. These actions and 

measures will be socialised with the 

workers on site. 

To support the health of our 

employees and their families, we 

have established medical teams in 

every operational area. Our medical 

teams conduct routine check-ups and 

deliver various health programmes 

that aim to increase awareness about 

the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. 

These include healthy living tips, 

health education, and counselling 

related to chronic diseases.

HEALTH AND SAFETY 

PERFORMANCE 

[403-9]

We aim to eliminate fatalities and 

reduce accidents and injuries in 

our operations. All work-related 

accidents are recorded and evaluated. 

Recommendations are then 

implemented to prevent or reduce the 

reoccurrence of similar incidents. 

Our existing grievance mechanism 

allows workers to report any work-

related hazards and hazardous 

situations. To protect workers 

from reprisals, workers can make 

F I R S T  R E S O U R C E S  L I M I T E D

46


an anonymous report through a 

hotline number clearly displayed in 

the office. The hotline is managed 

by our internal audit team, who 

will investigate the issues reported. 

Workers are also allowed to stop 

work if they do not feel safe. 

The main hazards in plantations are 

falling sharp fronds and bunches 

during the harvesting process, and 

sharp fronds which are left on the 

ground to decompose and act as 

fertiliser. These are associated with 

relatively short-term injuries such 

as cuts and thorn-pricks, so our 

severity rate remains consistently  

low. To minimise the risk of injury,  

all harvesters are provided with  

PPE such as safety helmets, gloves 

and boots. 

Hazards in palm oil mills include 

overhead sling conveyors, slippery 

floors, hot steam and loud noises. 

Workers are regularly reminded to be 

vigilant and are briefed during daily 

shift meetings on any potential health 

and safety issues.

Although we make every effort to 

ensure the safety of our employees, 

we regret to report that there were 

two fatalities in our operations in 

2019. One was caused by a traffic 

accident, while the other was due to 

a fall. We have taken the necessary 

actions required to prevent the 

occurrence of such fatal accidents in 

the future.

In 2019, a total of three high 

consequence injuries were recorded. 

These incidents involved workers 

being struck by equipment as well 

as the wearing of jewellery when 

undertaking tasks. 

In order to prevent such incidents 

from happening again, we installed 

additional safety signs, carried out 

repair and replacement of equipment 

to ensure functionality and safety, 

conducted OHS talks for employees 

on prevention and vigilance, and 

reinforced the correct and proper use 

of PPE. 

Note: High consequence injuries were only tracked from 2018 based on the GRI Occupational Health and Safety 2018 Standard. A high consequence injury 

is defined as a work-related injury from which the worker cannot, does not, or is not expected to recover fully to pre-injury health status within six months, 

excluding fatalities. Rates are calculated based on 1,000,000 hours worked.

Note: Rates are calculated based on 1,000,000 hours worked.

SUPPLY CHAIN

MANAGING OUR  

SUPPLY CHAIN

[102-9, 103-1]

To ensure First Resources delivers on our 

commitment to providing long-term economic and 

social benefits to communities while minimising 

our environmental footprint, we are focused on 

developing a supply chain that is aligned to our 

sustainability policy. We are working towards 

achieving a fully traceable and transparent supply 

chain and engaging with our suppliers to bring 

them on board our sustainability journey with us. 

Fresh fruit bunches (FFB), the feedstock for our 

mills, are supplied by our own nucleus estates, 

third-party estates, thousands of individual farmers 

(plasma and independent), as well as FFB dealers 

who buy from farmers. Crude palm oil (CPO) 

and palm kernel (PK), which are raw materials for 

our processing plants, are either provided by First 

Resources-owned mills or sourced from third-party 

mills in Indonesia. 

Aside from FFB, CPO and PK, we also procure 

several other products and services to run our 

business. Of our non-palm procurement, our most 

significant spend for our operations is on fertilisers 

sourced from Indonesian companies. Other spend 

categories for our upstream operations include 

fuel, chemicals (methanol, bleaching earth and 

phosphoric acid), spare parts and other materials. 

In 2017, we developed our Sustainable Supply 

Chain Framework, a multi-pronged strategy 

comprising of supply chain traceability; supplier 

engagement; supplier assessment; and  

stakeholder collaboration.

SUPPLY CHAIN TRACEABILITY 

[103-1, 103-2, 103-3] 

One of our key commitments in 

our Policy on Sustainable Palm Oil 

is to ensure that our oil and refined 

products can be traced to their 

origin – initially to the palm oil mill 

but ultimately to the plantation. 

Traceability presents a complex 

but essential first step towards our 

ultimate goal in providing the level 

of transparency and confidence that 

is expected by our customers to 

guarantee that our products come 

from sustainable sources.

Our commercial team works closely 

with our sustainability team to 

achieve our Group’s traceability 

targets through active engagement 

with suppliers. 

Traceability to mills

For CPO to be fully traceable to  

mills, First Resources requires the 

parent company name, company 

name, mill name, mill address and 

geographical coordinates. In the case 

that any part of this information is 

missing or incomplete, CPO volumes 

from that particular supplier is 

treated as “untraceable”. This does 

not mean that we do not know the 

source, but rather that they do not 

fulfil the criteria for what we consider 

as traceable. 

Approximately 8% of our CPO 

feedstock are purchased from external 

suppliers. Since 2017, we managed 

to obtain all the necessary data to 

maintain 100% traceability to mills. 

A list of our CPO and PK suppliers 

are available on our website. In 2019, 

we took an additional step to increase 

transparency by disclosing the mill 

names, coordinates and addresses 

of our CPO and PK suppliers. We 

believe that doing so enables us to 

better mitigate the risk of policy non-

compliance in our supply chain. 

Traceability to plantations

Of all the FFB processed in our  

own mills in 2019, 92% came from 

our own plantations and plasma 

schemes, while the remaining 

8% was sourced from third-party 

suppliers. These include independent 

smallholders, medium-sized 

outgrowers and neighbouring 

plantation companies. FFB is also 

purchased from local traders who 

collect FFB from the surrounding 

area. In 2019, we maintained 

approximately 98% traceability of the 

FFB processed at our mills. 

To increase our mill’s traceability to 

plantation, we socialise our Supply 

Chain Framework to FFB dealers 

who have been supplying to us. 

This is followed by field visits to 

FFB collecting points. Quite often, 

third parties may be concerned 

about the sharing of data due to 

supplier confidentiality. Part of 

our socialisation process involves 

explaining our intention and that we 

will respect the confidentiality of the 

information shared. This has helped 

us obtain the details we require to be 

on track for achieving our target of 

100% traceability to plantation for 

First Resources-owned mills by 2020. 

We have also shared our concession 

maps with the Roundtable on 

Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). 

SUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT

First Resources endeavours to 

communicate our sustainability 

policy to our suppliers with the 

aim of developing a supply chain 

network that embodies the Group’s 

sustainability goals and practices.

Once we have traced where the 

supply of our raw materials come 

from, we are able to focus our 

supplier engagements with the 

key players in our supply chain. 

One-on-one meetings and group 

sessions are held to communicate 

our sustainability policies and 

expectations, and to help suppliers 

understand the importance of 

aligning their practices with  

our requirements. To date,  

feedback from participating  

suppliers has been generally 

supportive and constructive. 

Through constant dialogue with our 

suppliers, especially smallholders, 

we hope to build a relationship of 

mutual trust in order for them to 

feel confident in sharing information 

about the challenges they face in 

meeting new sustainability standards. 

A strong rapport with suppliers 

strengthens our ability to support them 

in their sustainability efforts without 

compromising on our policies.

SUPPLIER ASSESSMENT 

[308-1, 308-2, 414-1, 414-2]

Building on our traceability 

information and supplier  

engagement efforts, we then assess 

our suppliers to ensure their practices 

are in line with our Policy on 

Sustainable Palm Oil. 

Suppliers found to be non-compliant 

will be given the opportunity to 

undertake corrective actions within 

a certain timeline. In line with our 

policy, we will suspend sourcing from 

non-compliant suppliers found to be 

engaged in the development of High

Carbon Stock (HCS) forests, High 

Conservation Value (HCV) areas or 

peat areas, using of fires during land 

preparation or in the exploitation of 

local communities, and who do not 

take immediate remedial actions. 

In 2019, we have not found any 

suppliers in breach of our policy 

requirements. 

All our new suppliers are also 

screened using social and 

environmental criteria during our 

supplier onboarding process. This 

process involves the signing of an 

onboarding form to acknowledge 

that they will comply with our policy 

requirements, as well as providing 

their mill or estate information to 

fulfil our traceability process. We 

will verify the information provided, 

and companies who cannot meet our 

requirements will not be onboarded 

as a new supplier.  

STAKEHOLDER 

COLLABORATION

We acknowledge that getting 

suppliers on board is not a task 

we can undertake on our own and 

we rely heavily on stakeholder 

collaboration. External stakeholders 

may hold better monitoring tools 

and intelligence to detect potential 

errant or non-compliant suppliers. In 

addition to our own assessments, we 

leverage on external parties to help 

us identify suppliers that we should 

further assess and engage with. 

For example, a non-governmental 

organisation (NGO) that works to 

protect the environment, sends us 

monthly reports of their deforestation 

detection. We look through these 

to see if any of the highlighted 

companies are in our supply chain 

which require us to undertake follow-

up actions. 

SUPPORTING 

SMALLHOLDERS

[103-1, 103-2, 103-3] 

Smallholders account for 

approximately 40% of Indonesia’s 

oil palm plantations. As a company 

managing 181,065 hectares of 

nucleus plantations, First Resources 

is in a unique position to share our 

experience on best agricultural 

practices with the smallholders we 

work with and to facilitate their 

inclusion in the company’s supply 

chain. We believe this is essential to 

support the transition of the palm oil 

industry into a truly sustainable one.

Through the Free, Prior and 

Informed Consent (FPIC) process, 

which is carried out before any 

new development, we are able 

to identify communities that are 

interested in partnering with us to 

develop plantations. We work with 

indigenous and local communities 

through various plasma scheme 

partnerships. In some of these 

schemes, the company assists plasma 

smallholders to develop and manage 

their plots until the oil palm trees 

reach a productive age, and after 

which the plots are handed back to 

the smallholders for management. 

In other partnership schemes, the 

company assumes responsibility 

for developing and managing the 

plasma plots on behalf of these 

smallholders, even after maturity. 

Plasma smallholders profit by selling 

their FFB harvests to the company 

at government-determined prices. 

These partnerships provide a 

sustainable income for thousands of 

smallholders, and this in turn directly 

impacts local economic growth and 

living standards. 

We are committed to working 

with our schemed smallholders 

to improve their yields. Without 

adequate support programmes in 

place, smallholders may not be able 

to cope with risks of price volatility. 

Our field officers provide technical 

assistance and practical training 

such as quality seed stock and 

advice on fertiliser and pesticide 

procurement and usage. They also 

share new farming technologies, 

offer assistance with land titling and 

coordinate transportation of FFB to 

palm oil mills. As of end 2019, we 

manage 31,008 hectares of plasma 

smallholders, representing 15% of 

the total plantation area managed 

by First Resources, and 10.5% of the 

FFB we processed. All of our plasma 

smallholders are involved in our 

smallholder programmes. 

For independent smallholders, we 

work with them to socialise our 

Policy on Sustainable Palm Oil 

and ensure that they adhere to our 

standards via workshops. During 

the workshops, we also take the 

opportunity to ask new independent 

smallholders to fill in our supplier 

onboarding form, in which they 

acknowledge they have received and 

understood our policy requirements.

PROTECTING  

CONSUMER HEALTH

[102-6, 416-2]

Customers of First Resources 

comprise primarily traders, palm 

oil refiners, and renewable energy 

producers. We sell our products 

in both, local and export markets. 

For our export sales, we mainly 

sell them on Free on Board (FOB) 

basis to our customers who then 

ship the products globally, with the 

biggest markets being China, India 

and Europe. We work closely with 

our customers to meet their varying 

needs and respond to the growing 

market demand for traceable and 

sustainable palm oil. 

Whilst First Resources does not 

produce consumer brands, we are 

committed to safeguarding consumer 

health. We have put in place relevant 

certification systems to ensure that 

our processing plants achieve and 

adhere to best practices for product 

quality and safety standards. Since 

2013, our kernel crushing plant has 

been certified to the Hazard Analysis  

and Critical Control Points 

(HACCP), and good manufacturing 

practices GMP+ B2 standards. 

We have also achieved HACCP 

certification for both our refineries in 

September 2019.  

In 2019, there were no incidents of 

non-compliance relating to the  

health and safety of our products  

and services.  

SUSTAINABILITY 

CERTIFICATIONS

[102-13, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 102-12]

To demonstrate our commitment to 

sustainability and meet the growing 

demand for sustainable palm oil, 

we continue to actively participate 

in various industry schemes and 

work towards obtaining relevant 

industry certifications. These include 

the Roundtable on Sustainable 

Palm Oil (RSPO), the Indonesia 

Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) and the 

International Sustainability Carbon 

Certification (ISCC).  

ROUNDTABLE ON 

SUSTAINABLE PALM OIL (RSPO)

First Resources has been a member 

of the RSPO since 2008. Since 2018, 

two of our mills in Riau have been 

RSPO certified. In addition, both of 

our processing units (PT Adhitya 

Serayakorita and PT Ciliandra 

Perkasa) and bulking station (PT 

Meridan Sejatisurya) are certified 

against the RSPO Supply Chain 

Certification Standard. 

In 2019, we were unable to certify 

additional mills due to the High 

Conservation Value (HCV) 

complaint at PT Limpah Sejahtera 

that was re-opened. We worked 

closely with RSPO to fulfil the 

requirements to resolve the case. In 

February 2020, the case was resolved, 

and we were also able to certify 

another mill. For more information, 

refer to our grievance list. We will 

continue our efforts to achieve 

our target of certifying all of First 

Resources plantations and mills by 

2024. To meet this target, we will look 

to certify another five mills integrated 

with plantations in 2020.

INDONESIA SUSTAINABLE 

PALM OIL (ISPO)

In 2019, we maintained our ISPO 

certification for nine of our mills 

which are integrated with plantations. 

We have also maintained the ISPO 

certification for one of our plantation. 

To date, 49% of our plantations are 

ISPO certified.

While we commenced the process 

to certify another mill integrated 

with plantation in 2019, the available 

resources had to be redirected 

towards a customer audit. As a result, 

we were not able to complete the 

entire certification process in time. 

Nevertheless, we aim to achieve ISPO 

certification for another five mills 

which are integrated with plantations 

in 2020.    

INTERNATIONAL 

SUSTAINABILITY CARBON 

CERTIFICATION (ISCC)

In 2019, we have successfully 

renewed all our ISCC certifications. 

As of 31 December 2019, 51,020 

hectares of our nucleus plantations 

are certified under the ISCC scheme, 

which is approximately 28% of our 

total nucleus area. In addition, six of 

the Group’s 17 palm oil mills, both 

our processing units and one bulking 

unit are ISCC certified. We are thus 

able to provide customers with a fully 

traceable product under the ISCC 

scheme.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS

Analisis Mengenai Dampak 

Lingkungan (AMDAL) 

A mandatory environmental impact assessment in Indonesia required to be 

carried out for a planned development project that is likely to have significant 

impact to the environment. 

Biodiversity 

The diversity (number and variety of species) of plant and animal life within a 

region.

Biological Oxygen Demand 

(BOD)

The amount of oxygen consumed by bacteria and other microorganisms when 

decomposing organic matter under aerobic conditions (i.e. when oxygen is 

present) at a specified temperature.

Carbon Dioxide Equivalents 

(CO2e)

A standard unit for measuring carbon footprints. It is to express the impact of 

each different GHG in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide that would create 

the same amount of warming. That way, a carbon footprint consisting of different 

types of GHG can be expressed as a single number.

Chemical Oxygen Demand 

(COD) 

Another indicator of contamination that shows the amount of dissolved matter 

in water that is susceptible to being oxidised. While BOD uses bacteria and other 

microorganisms to test, COD uses chemicals to test. 

Crude palm oil (CPO) 

The oil extracted from the pulp of the FFB. 

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 

The genetic code that determines all the characteristics of a living organism.  

Effluents

Wastewater discharged from a source (such as mill) into a separate body of water.

Extraction rate

The amount of oil recovered from FFB (in percentage) at a mill. CPO is extracted 

from the flesh of the FFB's fruitlets; PKO from the kernel of the FFB's fruitlets.

Empty fruit bunch (EFB)

The remains of the FFB after it has been processed and its fruitlets removed at 

the mill.

Fire Danger Indices (FDI) 

An internal index for fire risk assessment which has four levels: Low, Medium, 

High and Extreme, depending on humidity, rain and fuel conditions.  

F I R S T  R E S O U R C E S  L I M I T E D

68


Fresh fruit bunch (FFB)

The ripe fruit bunch harvested from the oil palm tree. The weight of the fruit 

bunch ranges between 10 kg to 40 kg depending on the size and age.

Free, Prior and Informed 

Consent (FPIC)

The principle that a community or indigenous people has a right to give or 

withhold its consent to projects that are proposed, which may affect them or 

their lands they customarily own, occupy or use.

Greenhouse gas (GHG)

A gas that has the property of absorbing and emitting infrared radiation, creating 

a greenhouse effect. 

Global Reporting Initiative 

(GRI)

A multi-stakeholder standard for sustainability reporting, providing guidance on 

determining report content and indicators.

High Conservation Value 

(HCV)

Areas with biological, ecological, social or cultural values of outstanding 

significance at the national, regional or global level or of critical importance at 

the local level.

High Conservation Value -  

High Carbon Stock Approach 

(HCV-HCSA) assessments 

A participatory process for identifying social and environmental values which 

need to be conserved in production landscapes. As per the revised RSPO 

Principles and Criteria released in November 2018, any new land clearing (in 

existing plantations or new plantings) after 15 November 2018 must be preceded 

by a HCV-HCSA assessment. 

High Carbon Stock (HCS) 

Approach

A practical methodology for distinguishing forest areas that should be protected 

from degraded lands that may be developed. It is a sequence of processes and 

assessments undertaken within two overarching modules: a social requirements 

module, which focuses on respecting communities’ rights to their lands; and an 

integration module, which includes the FPIC and HCV processes.

Integrated Fire Management 

(IFM)

An in-depth workplan for fire prevention, preparedness, response and recovery.

Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil

A mandatory certification requirement for all oil palm growers and millers 

operating in Indonesia imposed by the government in an effort to preserve 

the environment, promote economic and social activities, and enforcement of 

Indonesian statutory laws in the palm oil sector.
