STRATEGY AND 

ANALYSIS

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

As a leading fast moving consumer goods (“FMCG”) company in 

Singapore, we pride ourselves upon our ability to create sustainable 

value through our numerous business activities. Sustainability, in 

the manner we conduct our day-to-day dealings with customers, 

suppliers, employees and society, has been and will always be 

one of the key corporate values motivating and inspiring us to 

consistently do our best.

SOLAR POWER INSTALLATION

Increasingly, there has been heightened focus amongst stakeholders 

for the use of the Earth’s resources in a manner that is extensive 

yet sustainable. The use of clean, renewable energy is one of the 

most important actions companies can take to directly reduce their 

footprint upon the environment and to move towards a more energy 

efficient future. The benefits are multifold; in aspects of greater 

energy security, economic development and price stability, for they 

produce neither greenhouse gases – which causes climate change, 

nor polluting emissions. 

STATEMENT FROM THE MOST SENIOR 

DECISION MAKER OF THE ORGANIZATION

102-14

In this regard, Hanwell has invested significantly in the installation of Photovoltaic (PV) panels to reduce its dependency 

on fossil fuels and increase its exposure to solar power. Completed on 7th May 2018, the 1’008.15kWp solar panels have 

had their initial manifestation of carbon reduction; equivalent to approximately 27’564 trees of carbon dioxide offset in year 

one alone. Following Singapore’s formal pledge in the 2016 Paris Climate Change Accord to reduce emissions intensity 

by 36% from 2005 to 2030, this makes it commercially viable for companies like Hanwell to further intensify their efforts 

towards sustainable production. 

Our initiatives on energy saving via adoption of technology have contributed to lower energy consumption and in turn, 

smaller carbon footprint from the Group as follows:

STRATEGY AND 

ANALYSIS

ENSURING FOOD SAFETY WITH FOOD TRACEABILITY

Food traceability has become increasingly important today. Be it from the perspective of public food safety, businesses, 

supply chain, or consumers, the benefits of greater transparency are multifold. By collaborating with our major supplier 

Chaoren Pokphand, we have been able to extend food traceability to our rice consumers regionally.

Food traceability allows us to improve consumers’ confidence in our brand as well as manage our supply chain. If done 

right, sustainable production of our food sources can be ensured for many generations to come.

PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY WITH HEALTHY FOOD CHOICES

Not only do dietary choices impact human health, they also carry significant implications on the health of the planet arising 

from shifts in consumption patterns by consumers. Today, greater transparency is demanded in the various sourcing, 

production and transportation practices of global food brands. Accordingly, this creates an impending need for companies 

to address this trend in order to stay relevant in a rapidly changing industry landscape.

Over the past year, Hanwell had the following initiatives:

• Food safety process certification for our subsidiary, Fortune Food Manufacturing’s new tofu facility.

• Healthier food choices such as products labelled with the Health Promotion Board’s Healthier Choice Symbol.

• Engagement of the local community using themes related to healthy diet choices.

Additionally, they also have a unique line of low glycaemic-index Basmati Long-Grain Rice in place to complement their 

traditional business offerings of shrink-wrapped rice, organic, brown and red rice.

FOSTERING COMMUNITY SPIRIT WITH ACTIVE OUTREACH EFFORTS

Giving back to the community is important. It not only allows us to positively impact society, it also enables us to actively 

engage our stakeholders. Here at Hanwell, we are committed to being good and responsible corporate social citizens 

while pursuing our business objectives. Continuous involvement in community programs is encouraged, with employee 

volunteerism instilled as key aspects of our corporate identity.

Lastly, we would also like to take this opportunity to highlight our efforts in reducing our reliance on paper. From FY2018 onwards, 

hard copies of all annual reports and/or shareholders’ circulars shall only be sent to shareholders upon specific requests by them 

for it. This will not only prevent unnecessary cutting down of trees, but also allow us to save approximately S$40,000.

The Board has considered sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation, determined the material sustainability 

factors; overseeing management and monitoring of the material factors in this report.

PROFILE


In Japan, we recently acquired two immovable properties in Osaka and Kyoto 

City respectively.  Comprising a combined total floor area of 518.31 sqm and 

a total land area of 165.56 sqm, these properties are strategically situated in 

the entertainment area of Dotonbori, which is Osaka’s most famous tourist 

destination, as well as Gion, which is where Kyoto’s most famous Yasaka 

Shrine resides. We expect both properties to be potential core investments 

for us.  

The Group’s policy is to continually ensure that all our supplies are purchased 

from sustainable sources. We suspend procurement of fast moving consumer 

goods as well as raw materials from suppliers which are reported to have 

engaged in errant practices until there is reasonable assurance that the 

offending practice has been rectified.

ETHICS AND 

INTEGRITY

CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP PROGRAM

Getting involved in the community is a great way for any organization to build relationship, boost visibility and create brand 

awareness. Whether it is by sponsoring or taking part in community programs, or by enabling employee volunteerism, 

companies that encourage involvement in the community stand out among their peers and see multiple benefits as a 

result, such as a happier workforce or more loyal customer base.

Tipex has partnered with The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund to increase participation for its Corporate Social 

Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. For this year specifically, “Beautex: Life’s Beautiful” Art Competition 2018 was organised, 

with the theme of “Healthy Living” for participants. The objective is to advocate the importance of healthy living through 

the hosting of an art competition and to contribute their share towards a healthier and inclusive society. Collectively, the 

vision is to forge a new, and more sustainable business future for both Tipex and the communities that it has adopted as 

part of its CSR drive.

Together with support from the Health Promotion Board, a series of health-based activities, including the dissemination of 

collaterals, the hosting of a “Eat Right, Get Moving” workshop and the performance of a 30 minutes educational skit titled 

“My Happy Healthy Family” were conducted. Through which, these initiatives promoted healthier eating habits, increased 

adoption of physical activities in daily routine and highlighted the importance of positive communication and positive role 

modelling of parents.

Besides community-based efforts, product responsibility is another key aspect of Tipex’s corporate sustainability efforts. 

All of their pulp papers are sourced from arenas that are FSC certified to ensure that their impact upon the environment 

is kept to the minimum. These adds to the list of industry standards which Tipex already conforms to, such as the 

FSC-CoC (Forest Stewardship Council – Chain of Custody), ISO9001:2015 (Quality Management System), ISO14001:2015 

(Environmental Management System), ISO22000:2005 (Food Safety Management System) and HACCP (Hazard Analysis 

and Critical Control Points).

To better reflect their responsiveness to the needs of today’s consumers, Tipex recently launched their new sugarcane mix 

pulp toilet rolls, which is environmentally friendly. Made out of a renewable plant with no replanting required, it addresses 

consumers’ desire for new and innovative products that are both valued for money while also contributing to a relevant 

cause. This comes as Tipex sets up its new production plant with targets to increase product output, improve energy 

efficiency, enhance product safety and boost workplace safety. All-in-all, the sustainability of a business is key to its long-

term viability, something which Tipex is cognisant of and constantly moving towards.

Lastly, to keep themselves ahead of the competition, our top-selling in-house tissue paper brand Beauty &amp; Mood recently 

underwent a rebranding exercise from June and November 2018, so to better anchor its brand in the local market as well 

as overseas. Through a structured brand roadmap and clearly defined brand identity, Tipex seeks to translate this into sales 

growth and increased profit for the business.

ANTI-CORRUPTION

The Group’s Code of Conduct for its directors, management and employees strictly prohibit involvement in corruption 

activities such as the acceptance or giving of bribes.

STAKEHOLDER 

ENGAGEMENT







• 

Stakeholder engagement is a daily part of our business in the course of our 

cooperation with manufacturers, suppliers, corporate buyers such as NTUC 

Fairprice and government bodies to deliver a diverse range of consumer 

essentials.

• 

When engaging each stakeholder group, we consider the group’s impact on 

the demand for our products, as well as the staff and investment resources 

involved. The order in the 102-40 list represents how we often prioritize 

stakeholders.

• 

We typically engage each stakeholder group annually, be it through trade 

exhibitions or customer surveys with follow-on activities on a case by case 

basis. Each key operating subsidiary has various community development 

programs, and many of these programs are carried out annually.

• 

We collaborate with external stakeholders to promote the integration of 

sustainable practices in the value chains of our wide range of fast moving 

consumer goods.

• 

Our manufacturing facilities conduct annual customer surveys to solicit 

feedback on product quality, on-time delivery, after-sales service and our 

product pricing.



Rice, oil, paper and soybeans are among the more important raw materials in our

REPORTING APPROACH AND FRAMEWORK

We refer to the Global Reporting Initiative (2016) (“GRI”) as a framework for disclosure inclusion. Disclosures revolve 

around the value chains in our key business segments including Topseller, Tipex and Fortune Food Manufacturing. We have 

prioritized our scope of reporting as follows:

• 

Brands that have the greatest impact to the Group’s revenues.

• 

Activities that contribute to our product brand equity.

• 

Industry standards that are considered important by stakeholders such as customers, principals, suppliers and 

shareholders.

TOPIC BOUNDARIES

We aim to create public awareness about the sustainable value chains behind our key brands. Metrics applicable to GRI 

core disclosures are reported only if they are a good representation the impact of our value chains. For example, we do not 

report the percentage of suppliers assessed for social impact because many of them have relatively low impact on cost of 

goods sold and business revenue. Rather, we focus on discussing the management approach of principal suppliers based 

on each one’s upstream social and environmental impact and downstream business impact through the Group.

WHY GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES ARE IMPORTANT




HANWELL HOLDINGS LIMITED   SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 

SPECIFIC STANDARDS DISCLOSURE

SUSTAINABLE RICE 

PRODUCTION

As a marketing and distribution business for fast moving consumer goods, it is the Group’s strategy to educate consumers 

on aspects of the value chain that affect their ultimate purchasing decisions. We aim to use this sustainability report as a 

platform for stakeholders as well as consumers to understand issues at stake in the value chain of a staple such as rice.

It is intended to be part of a larger feedback loop that leads to better informed decision making by consumers. This will 

ultimately enhance our capability to improve product mix and add value to our product range.

This section focuses on good agricultural practices (GAP) and draws on guidelines published under United Nations reporting 

framework, Sustainable Assessment of Food and Agriculture Systems.

Food traceability has become increasingly important today. For public safety, it’s about reducing food fraud incidences 

and adulteration, disease management and environmental emergencies. For businesses, it’s all about risk management 

and mitigation; lowering the impact of recalls and lowering liability costs. For the supply chain, efficiencies relate to 

productivity; cash flow improvements; innovation; and reducing waste. And for consumers, it’s about access to markets 

and specialty foods; and enhancing or strengthening brand confidence.

As consumers become increasingly conscious of the broader repercussions of their lifestyles on the global ecosystem, 

this naturally culminates in them demanding greater transparency from the world’s food system; requiring food brands 

to be more transparent regarding their sourcing, production and transportation practices, as well as the nutrient content 

present in the everyday food consumables.

In this regard, Chaoren Pokphand (“CP”) has invested significantly in the improvement of its supply chain performance, 

through the changing of suppliers and processes, training of employees, and the instillation of monitoring and reporting 

mechanisms. These are steps which CP believes are necessary for them to address concerns relating to consumers’ 

health, the environment, the well-being of workers and animal welfare.

Social responsibility has and will continue to be an essential charter of CP’s sustainability practices. With the world’s 

population projected to increase to 9.6 billion by 2050, this inadvertently puts pressure on the global food industry to 

adopt sustainable solutions to tackle the devastating impact of climate change, pollution, deforestation, energy and water 

consumption, resource degradation and depletion, and food waste on the global food supply.

Specifically, one of the initiatives being brought forth by CP then, was the integration of digital traceability systems within 

their supply chain. Through this measure, CP seeks to serialize the rice they produce using a unique identifier number. 

This enables tracking in real-time from the moment the raw materials are sourced through to production, warehousing 

and delivery, before eventually ending up on the consumer’s plate. It also gives CP improved supply chain visibility and 

better control over how it plans to achieve its specific sustainability targets, so as to optimise resources in a manner which 

has minimal impact to the environment. Through continual engagement of its various stakeholders, CP aim to ensure 

sustainable production of its food sources for many generations to come.

HOW WE MANAGE THE IMPACT OF GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES




SPECIFIC STANDARDS DISCLOSURE 

HANWELL HOLDINGS LIMITED   SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 13

SUSTAINABLE RICE 

PRODUCTION

In 1986, Hanwell Holdings Limited (formerly known as PSC Corporation Ltd) wanted to distribute jasmine rice, a long-grain 

strain of fragrant rice, from CP Intertrade in Thailand (the rice processing arm of Asia’s largest agribusiness conglomerate 

Chaoren Pokphand). In those days, few Thai products were labelled in English. Hanwell worked with its rice processing 

partner to identify an English brand name for jasmine rice imported from Thailand. Hanwell and CP Intertrade eventually 

decided to use “Royal Umbrella” as the brand name to distribute Thai Hom Mali rice to English speaking consumer 

markets. The brand name was subsequently translated into other languages.

Today, Royal Umbrella Thai Hom Mali rice has become Thailand’s top export brand. CP Intertrade processes different sub-

brands of rice according to the diverse cultural palates of each market. The quality of rice paddy that is trucked into its 

processing facilities, state-of-the-art production equipment, a strong marketing and distribution network, as well as strong 

R&amp;D all play a part in the success of this brand name.

Engaging farmers to adopt GAP is the first stage of this success story. The Royal Umbrella Thai Hom Mali rice supply chain 

starts from providing farmers with top grade grains for planting and culminates in international rice tasting competitions 

such as the World Best Rice award organized by the World Rice Conference. Royal Umbrella Thai Hom Mali rice bagged 

the World Best Rice award which was held in the Philippines in 2009. In Singapore, Royal Umbrella has been awarded the 

annual Reader’s Digest Trusted Brands for 15 years running – from 2004 to 2018. It won the Platinum award in 2017 and 

2018.

In Singapore, Royal Umbrella has been awarded the annual

ASSESSMENT OF HEALTH AND SAFETY IMPACT OF PRODUCT CATEGORIES 

Foodborne diseases can be a widespread public health problem and even adversely impact the economy as seen during the 

SARS outbreak. Thanks to the stringent regulation by the Agri-Food &amp; Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA), Singapore 

enjoys one of the lowest incidences of foodborne disease outbreaks compared to the rest of the world.

The Group views any incident of food contamination  seriously as this will affect our reputation, brand value, sales and even 

bottom line in the event of product recall.

We have a robust system in place to prevent incidences of food contamination.

103-1

WHY FOOD SAFETY IS IMPORTANT 

We work closely with AVA to ensure that all our food products meet stringent quality and safety standards. Our factory 

has attained certification for Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) and Food Safety System Certification 

(FSSC) 22000.

All the food products manufactured by Fortune Food are assessed for improvement in the following life cycle stages:

•

FORTUNE FOOD 

MANUFACTURING

Dietary choices not only impact on human health, but also have significant implications for the health of the planet 

– upon which human health is reliant – and for our ability to feed current and future generations equitably. Our food 

system contributes significantly to climate change through greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; and impacts negatively on 

ecosystems, including through deforestation, water use, overfishing, pollution and biodiversity loss.

In response to the push by Health Promotion Board for Singaporeans to have a healthy diet and the desire by consumers 

here to pursue cleaner food choices, Hanwell has rolled out several healthy food choices and promoted the use of online 

platforms to encourage a healthy eating lifestyle. Specifically, they introduced tofu product with vegetarian DHA and 

sought the use of non-genetic modified soybeans in the manufacture of all of their Fortune’s tofu products.  

Other than these initiatives to enhance the health of their consumers, Fortune Food also places a high emphasis upon 

food safety certification to ensure that products, processes or systems in the food supply chain are in compliance with 

accepted food safety standards. With regards, the Food Safety System Certification 22000 (FSSC 22000) is an additional 

qualification obtained by Fortune Food in FY2018 to enhance their commitment to food safety and instil greater confidence 

in consumers for the quality of food produced. Graded higher than the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), 

this certification will better equip Fortune Foods with the capability to export their tofu products to the regions of Europe 

and the United States.

The noise level generated by our paper cutting machines  may result in hearing loss of a worker handling these machines 

if his naked ear is exposed to the noise over a long period. There is also a significant amount of particulate airborne paper 

fibers that are by-produced in the course of cutting paper. We have a committee that looks into the Occupational Health 

and Safety (OH&amp;S) of our factory.

Occupational Health: Ear plugs are personal protection equipment for our workers who operate cutting machines.

PAPER

RESPONSIBILITY

Most of our raw material is paper, and that is produced from wood. Deforestation, the clearance of forests for conversion 

of land to a non-forest use, accounts for almost the same carbon emissions as the entire world’s transport sector and is a 

major driver of biodiversity loss.

Many of our customers now require our paper products to be certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC®).

POLICY

We use only virgin pulp paper procured from FSC® certified suppliers. The certification system allows us to identify, 

purchase and use wood, paper and other forest products produced from well-managed forests and/or recycled materials. 

We have adopted its Chain of Custody system.

We have 8 paper roll suppliers – two from China, two from Vietnam, two from Indonesia, one from Taiwan, and one from 

Malaysia. Most of the material for our packaging boxes are from recycled sources.
