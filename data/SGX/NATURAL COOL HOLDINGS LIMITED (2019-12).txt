Increasing the penetration rate of air-
conditioners will have a growing impact on
global warming caused by consequential
increase in electricity use. To deal with this,
we spread positively conscious products
using energy-efficient inverter technology
like R-32, a refrigerantwith low environmental
impact, to our customers. Our suppliers had
been phasing out air-conditioners using
R-22 refrigerant, and production of these
products will cease by year 2020.

5-tick air-conditioners to customers as part
of our continued commitment to become
an environment-friendly organisation. In
2019, 5-tick air-conditioners accounted
for approximately 70% [2018: 60%] of
the Group's total sales in air-conditioning
division.
Meanwhile, Natural Cool accelerates the
number of technical training sessions for
our contractor customers supported by
our air-conditioner brands. In 2019, we
organised more than 10 such training
ranging from productive and efficient
installation practices to improve installers'
productivity, installation of R32 refrigerant
air-conditioners, to introducing Daikin's
new Super Multi HW System that sends
recyclable heat from outdoor condensing
unit to storage water heater to heat up water
inside. This system aims to reduce usage
of electricity for water heating when the air
conditioner is operating.

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
Natural Cool applies the Quality-and-Cost
based method for its sourcing activity. Based
on this methodology, price is considered on
par with other qualifications-based criteria,
including relevant certification requirements,
