Scope and Boundaries

T

o determine the boundaries of this report, and the most significant 

aspects for disclosure, Wilmar International Limited (‘Wilmar’ or ‘the 

Group’) has been guided by the Global Reporting Index (GRI) Sustainability 

Reporting Standards and the Singapore Exchange (SGX) Sustainability 

Reporting Guide. This report provides an update on the Group’s performance 

in relation to our sustainability commitments, placing particular focus on 

our No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation (NDPE) policy. It also 

covers our contributions to the United Nations Sustainable Development 

Goals (SDGs) (see page 8).

The scope of this report includes both upstream and downstream businesses 

where we have a major presence and over 50% shareholding with operational 

control. For palm oil, our primary focus is the performance of our own 

plantations, mills and refineries in Indonesia, Malaysia, Ghana and Nigeria. 

Having expanded the scope of our reporting in 2017, we now also include 

our sugar operations in Myanmar, Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia.

In February 2014, Wilmar became an investor in Mumbai-based Shree 

Renuka Sugars (SRS) Ltd., India’s leading sugar company. We subsequently 

increased our stake to 58% as part of a comprehensive debt restructuring 

exercise, and SRS became an indirectly owned subsidiary of Wilmar in June 

2018. Performance data for SRS is currently limited due to the timing of this 

acquisition and will be included in our next sustainability report.

This report focuses on business areas and activities under our control: those 

of our own palm oil and sugar operations, our crude palm and lauric oil 

suppliers, and our fresh fruit bunch (FFB) suppliers. Data on our supply chain 

are therefore limited to traceability and supplier monitoring. Although we 

now have better insight into the performance of our key suppliers, we do 

not disclose this information as it is subject to confidentiality agreements.

The performance data disclosed does not cover:

• 

Downstream or upstream operations in which Wilmar has 50% ownership, 

or less, or operations over which the Group does not have management 

control unless otherwise stated;

• 

Other downstream and upstream activities outside the Group’s palm 

oil and sugar operations;

• 

Environmental figures for unplanted areas inside Group plantations 

(although data on conservation areas and fire incidents are included).

• 

SRS Ltd. India sugar operations; and 

• 

Data on third-party suppliers, except for traceability and supplier 

monitoring.

About This

Report

A

t Wilmar, we are committed 

to change. As Asia’s leading 

agribusiness group and one of the 

world’s foremost palm oil producers, 

we believe in transforming for the 

better and are driven to create a vibrant 

and sustainable future.

Leveraging on an integrated 

agribusiness model enables us to 

optimise logistical advantages and 

take an end-to-end approach to drive 

sustainable growth. At every stage 

of our business operations, we seek 

to uphold the highest standards and 

practices, paving the way forward with 

effective strategy, strong governance 

and full transparency.

This year’s Sustainability Report is 

symbolic of our commitment to 

drive positive transformation in the 

agricultural sector. The cover image 

features key icons integral to our 

growth and transformation. From palm 

trees and sugarcane, farms and mills, 

flora and fauna, staff and family, these 

different elements and stakeholders 

form the very essence of Wilmar and 

the impact we have on the industry, 

environment and community.

We are focused on Driving 

Transformation, working collectively 

with our stakeholders to build a 

better business and in doing so, 

build a better future.

About This

Report

Reporting Period

Unless otherwise stated, this report 

covers performance data for the 

calendar year 2018. Five-year historical 

figures are provided where available. 

As the issues under discussion are 

evolving rapidly, we have also provided 

information on our progress in 2019, 

our planned activities and targets 

for 2019/2020, and our long-term 

sustainability objectives.

For this report, our Myanmar figures 

are based on the 2018 calendar year. 

These figures are not comparable to 

our previous report, for which data were 

collated based on the harvesting season 

(April 2017 to March 2018).

Topic Identification And 

Prioritisation

The key topics included in this 

report were identified through 

various forums and engagements, 

including email correspondence 

and telephone interviews with key 

stakeholder groups. Interviews were 

conducted with representatives from 

the finance and investment sector, 

the non-governmental organisation 

(NGO) sector and the customer base 

for our palm operations. In addition, 

we reviewed topics covered by other 

palm oil and sugar related initiatives, 

such as the Zoological Society of 

London’s (ZSL) Sustainable Palm 

Oil Transparency Initiative (SPOTT), 

KnowTheChain 2018 Benchmark 

Report, Global Child Forum 2018 

benchmark study on Corporate 

Responses to Protecting Children’s 

Rights in Southeast Asia, the High 

Carbon Stock Approach (HCSA) 

Steering Group and CDP disclosures.

Key environmental, social and 

governance issues were also verified 

in consultation with key internal 

stakeholders and plotted in materiality 

matrices (see next page). An internal 

group sustainability meeting was then 

held in November 2018 to review the 

2017 sustainability reporting process 

and discuss key material topics with 

each department representative.

For our palm oil business, several 

emergent issues have been evaluated 

as significantly important for both 

Wilmar and our external stakeholders. 

Especially noteworthy are third-party 

supply chain monitoring, supplier 

assessments, labour issues and 

challenges relating to land status in 

Indonesia. 

For our sugar operations, the 

materiality matrix developed for 

our Sustainability Report 2017 was 

primarily based on our perception of 

general global themes, sector-specific 

impacts, and risks linked to landscapes 

in which we operate. For this report 

we have consulted with our operations 

in Australia, Myanmar and the trading 

department to refine the matrix and 

prioritise issues. As this exercise was 

carried out prior to Wilmar gaining a 

majority stake in SRS Ltd., our new 

sugar venture in India, this business 

has been excluded from the process. 

India shall be included in our 2019 

report. Some indicators have also been 

consolidated for clarity.

In 2019, we will consider organising 

workshops for both internal 

and external stakeholders prior 

to conducting the materiality 

survey to ensure a comprehensive 

understanding of the exercise.

Validation and Review

We validate our material aspects 

and ensure balance in our reporting 

through the following processes:

• 

Through the reporting process, 

continuously monitoring 

stakeholder concerns to ensure 

that these are covered by the 

report;

• 

Through advice from our reporting 

consultant, Helikonia, based 

on their in-depth knowledge 

of the palm oil industry and its 

stakeholders; and

• 

Through reviews and commentaries 

from various stakeholders and 

experts on critical aspects of our 

disclosure.

Assurance

Ernst &amp; Young LLP (EY) has been 

engaged to perform assurance 

work on selected disclosures in this 

report. This assurance is for the use 

of the Management of Wilmar only, 

and any use of or reliance upon this 

assurance by a third party is at the 

third party’s own risk. As sustainability 

reporting is an ongoing process, we 

have chosen to disclose and discuss 

some of the most pertinent material 

issues for Wilmar and its stakeholders 

within the boundaries of this report. 

Due to the inherent limitations of 

the internal control structure, it is 

possible that errors or irregularities 

in the information presented have 

occurred and have not been detected. 

We continually strive to strengthen our 

reporting processes and to present 

information in the most complete and 

accurate manner possible. Please refer 

to the section “Independent Limited 

Assurance Statement” on page 115 for 

more details.

W

e are pleased to present our 

2018 Sustainability Report, 

covering our palm oil and sugar 

operations for the financial year 2018.

It has been more than a decade since 

Wilmar embarked on a structured 

sustainability programme, and it 

has been both a satisfying and 

challenging journey. As a Board, we 

have experienced a steep learning 

curve to understand the material, 

environmental and social impacts 

that stem from our operations, the 

constantly evolving stakeholder 

landscape, and the improvements 

we can make towards the goal of 

becoming a sustainable business and 

an inspiration to our industry peers.

We believe that Wilmar is a leader 

in sustainable and responsible 

practices in the palm oil industry. Our 

achievements to date far exceed the 

expectations we had when we began 

our own sustainable certification 

journey in 2007. Today, we are actively 

ensuring that our supply chain is free 

from deforestation, new peatland 

development and exploitation, a policy

that we put in place in 2013. Going 

beyond our own operations to also 

cover third-party suppliers means that 

we are taking responsibility to drive the 

wider industry, and this is something 

we are proud of.

Our journey has been guided by our 

commitment to multi-stakeholder 

engagement and certification 

schemes. Today, 76% of our planted 

palm oil area has achieved RSPO 

certification, and in 2018 we produced 

about 681,000 tonnes of certified 

sustainable palm oil. Furthermore, 

our efforts to map and engage 

with our suppliers have enabled us 

to trace 96% of the oil handled by 

our refineries to mills. We are now 

using this information to monitor and 

provide support to more than 1,500 

plantations across almost 15 million 

hectares. This transparency in turn 

allows us to supply customers and 

consumers with palm oil that is free 

from exploitation and deforestation, 

and which does not contribute to 

peatland destruction.

In addition to sustainability in palm, 

we are pleased to report that we have

achieved 100% traceability of sugar 

to mills for both Australia refineries, 

as well as certification against the 

Bonsucro standard for three of our 

sugar mills and own farms supplying 

to them in Australia.

Small farmers make up a significant 

part of our supply chain. Without 

their success, we cannot claim to be 

making real change on the ground. We 

therefore continued our engagement 

efforts throughout 2018 to ensure 

that smallholders are part of our 

sustainability journey. In Myanmar, 

our sugar operations provided training 

on best practices for almost 1,000 

sugar farmers, and a further 3,000 

smallholders were engaged across 

Indonesia and Malaysia. Meanwhile, 

our pilot outgrower schemes in Nigeria 

continue to assist small farmers in 

strengthening sustainability standards 

and increasing access to markets. 

Wilmar’s operations are guided by a 

commitment to human rights. We work 

proactively to prevent the exploitation 

of workers and communities, and seek 

to immediately halt and remediate any 

infringement of our policies. Over the 

past two years, we have placed a great 

deal of our focus on strengthening 

worker rights in our plantations and 

mills. In Indonesia, we achieved an 

important milestone by converting the 

contracts of all our temporary workers’ 

in Central Kalimantan to permanent 

positions. Securing stronger labour 

union relations across our Indonesian 

operations has also been a key focus as 

we continue to build on a collaborative 

approach to workers’ rights.

The UN Sustainable Development 

Goals guide our efforts relating to 

child welfare and protection. In 2018, 

we undertook a range of initiatives to 

identify risks for children in and around 

our estates. We have also escalated our 

work to ensure that the 12,400 children 

living in our plantations in both Asia and 

Africa have access to decent primary 

schooling. Currently, about 84% of 

these children now attend school, 

and our objective is to ensure that 

we reach 100% attendance by 2025. 

These efforts have been strongly 

supported throughout the company, 

and we are therefore proud to be 

ranked number one in the Global 

Child Forum 2018 Corporate 

Responses to Protecting Children’s 

Rights in Southeast Asia report for the 

improvements we have made. 

Our commitment to combat climate 

change remains steadfast across all 

business areas. While we recognise 

that there is still much to do, we 

are pleased to report that we have 

exceeded our target to reduce our 

greenhouse gas emissions by 500,000 

tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. 

This reduction has been secured 

primarily through ongoing investment 

in methane capture facilities at our 

palm oil mills. 

We acknowledge that climate change 

is a fundamental threat to life on our 

planet, and that a combined effort 

is required from all agribusinesses 

to both curb emissions, through 

initiatives such as methane capture, 

and avoid emissions through strict 

bans on deforestation and peatland 

development. In this respect, we 

support the inclusion of the High 

Carbon Stock Approach and peat 

restrictions in the revised RSPO 

Principles &amp; Criteria, which was agreed 

by the RSPO General Assembly in 

2018. Wilmar was one of the many 

contributors to this laudable new 

standard, and we believe it will be 

instrumental in bringing larger 

palm oil companies onto a more 

responsible path.

We will continue to embrace 

sustainability wholeheartedly, 

improving the way we operate and 

inspiring other industry players in their 

own work to eradicate deforestation, 

peatland development and exploitation 

from their supply chains. We must be 

sincere and genuine in these efforts 

and collaborate with like-minded 

organisations towards this goal. As 

individual entities we can take steps, 

but only together can we complete 

the journey.

Message from  

the CEO



Panoramic view of planted areas in a Wilmar plantation

I am very proud to see the tremendous progress being made across all of Wilmar’s sugar and palm oil operations. 

I believe that our commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and our leadership on sustainability 

standards has set a great example for others to follow. 

It is disappointing, however, that we continue to be singled out for criticism by a number of civil society 

organisations. While these organisations acknowledge our contribution towards sustainability in the industry as 

a whole, they appear to be leveraging our position to put pressure on the rest of the industry. I am glad to see 

that many of our commercial stakeholders, especially our customers, are now much better informed, and have 

more in-depth knowledge and understanding of the industry, their supply chains and the other environmental 

and social variables that need to be factored in. 

Wilmar has always been, and will continue to be, open to discourse and engagement with both local and 

international NGOs. Such engagements can help the industry to identify gaps, and may potentially lead to 

improvements in best practice and efficiency in operations. However, the key elements of such engagements 

must be that all parties provide constructive feedback, agree to work together in providing solutions, and are 

able to manage expectations. I hope that the coming years will move us to a more collaborative space, where 

mutual guidance and the joint development of pragmatic solutions take the place of grievances and complaints.

Governance and

Management

Corporate Governance 

and Management

W

ilmar’s Board of Directors is 

responsible for the strategic 

direction of the Group and is its 

highest governing body. The Board 

is composed of Directors with diverse 

skills and qualifications in areas such 

as accounting, legal, finance and 

business management, as well as 

specific industry-relevant experience.

As at the date of this report, the Board 

has 12 members, including three 

Executive Directors and nine Non-

Executive Directors, six of whom are 

Independent Directors. Nine Board 

members are citizens of Singapore, 

one is a citizen of Malaysia, one is a 

citizen of the United States of America 

and one is a citizen of the People’s 

Republic of China. The Board is led 

by Mr Kuok Khoon Hong, who is 

our Chairman and Chief Executive 

Officer (CEO). The Lead Independent 

Director acts as a counter-balance on 

management issues in the decision-

making process. In February 2019, 

Wilmar appointed its first female 

Director to the Board.

The Board is supported by a key 

management team responsible for 

executing the Group’s strategy and 

operations. For more details about our

Sustainability Governance

and Management

Sustainability governance is a core 

function within the Group’s overall risk 

management structure. Our Chairman 

and CEO oversees the implementation 

of our No Deforestation, No Peat and 

No Exploitation (NDPE) policy, and is 

supported by the Risk Management 

Committee, which reviews 

sustainability reports and emerging 

issues on a quarterly basis. Wilmar will 

continue to review and enhance key 

performance indicators (KPIs) related 

to sustainability to further strengthen 

our governance practices in 2019.

Wilmar’s Sustainability Department is 

responsible for the implementation of 

the Group’s sustainability strategies. Its 

mandate covers the NDPE policy, the 

principles of the United Nations Global 

Compact, certifications, stakeholder 

engagement, corporate governance 

and reporting. The department is 

staffed by more than 60 employees 

worldwide, combining a wide range of 

relevant local and technical expertise 

across South East Asia, Europe and 

Africa. Wilmar’s Chief Sustainability 

Officer (CSO) spearheads the Group’s 

overall sustainability agenda, while 

the Group Sustainability General 

Manager (GM) is responsible for the 

implementation of these strategies and 

policies throughout our supply chain, 

as well as reviewing the progress of 

execution.

The implementation of our NDPE 

policy is supported by site- and 

regional-level operation teams, 

a communications team, and a 

Technical Advisory Group comprising 

NGOs and other sustainability partners. 

These teams provide input to the Joint 

Steering Committee, which oversees 

important strategic issues relating 

to the implementation of the NDPE 

policy and evaluates progress against 

policy targets. In addition, we have

Sustainability Values and ESG 

Topics Relating to the Five 

SDGs

In 2015, countries around the world 

adopted the 2030 Agenda for 

Sustainable Development and its 17 

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

Also recognising the private sector’s 

role and responsibility to support and 

build on these commitments, we have 

embedded five of the SDGs into our 

long-term sustainability strategy and, 

where applicable, have measured our 

performance against them. While 

specific reference to individual targets 

will not always be made, we have 

highlighted where our actions align 

with or contribute to the five identified 

SDGs in this report.

Furthermore, and as a responsible 

corporate citizen, Wilmar remains 

committed to good environmental, 

social and governance (ESG) practices. 

These ESG objectives steer the Group’s 

decisions and ensure that our approach 

to sustainability is integrated in all 

aspects of our business. We constantly 

engage with our stakeholders and 

evaluate ESG risks for all activities we 

are involved in.

ilmar is one of the world’s largest 

oil palm plantation owners. As at 

31 December 2018, our total planted 

area covers 230,4099 hectares in three 

main regions: 67% in Indonesia, 25% in 

East Malaysia and the remaining 8% in 

Africa, specifically Ghana and Nigeria. 

We own an additional 14,000 hectares 

of infrastructure area.

Wilmar directly manages about 35,800 

hectares belonging to smallholder 

schemes in Indonesia and Africa. 

Through joint ventures, we also own 

plantations covering approximately 

46,000 hectares in Uganda and West 

Africa10. An additional 149,000 hectares 

owned by smallholder and outgrower 

schemes are managed through these 

joint ventures and associates.

Wilmar operates 45 palm oil mills 

located across East Malaysia, 

Indonesia, Ghana and Nigeria11. In 

2018, a new mill was commissioned 

in Nigeria to replace an old, smaller-

capacity mill. Nine mills in Indonesia 

are independent operations that 

purchase fresh fruit bunches (FFB) 

exclusively from third-party suppliers.

Sugar 

Operations

W

ilmar has been involved in sugar 

production since 2010, and is 

now one of the world’s top 10 raw 

sugar producers. We are the largest 

raw sugar producer and refiner in 

Australia, the leading sugar refiner 

in Indonesia, and the top consumer 

pack sugar manufacturer in Australia 

and New Zealand. Our sugar business 

employs more than 4,000 employees 

globally.

Our sugar operations span Myanmar, 

Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand, 

and we have recently expanded 

our business in India. We made an 

additional investment in Mumbai-

based Shree Renuka Sugars (SRS) Ltd., 

increasing our shareholdings from 27% 

to 58% by the end of June 2018. SRS 

manages seven sugar cane mills with 

integrated ethanol and cogeneration 

units, two port-based refineries and 

Sugarcane planted area by 

country (ha) 2018 (Total 7,043 ha)

The timing of this acquisition puts the performance of our new India operations beyond the scope of this report. Data will be included in our 2019

Approximately 91% of our planted area 

is in Queensland, Australia, while the 

remaining 9% is situated in Northern 

Myanmar13.In 2018, our total planted 

area of 7,043 hectares produced 

505,363 tonnes of sugarcane.

In 2018, our plantations recorded 

yields of 91.4 tonnes and 69.4 tonnes 

of sugarcane per planted hectare in 

Australia and Myanmar respectively. 

Myanmar’s lower yields are attributed 

to different climatic conditions and 

lower levels of mechanisation.

operations in Australia expanded 

in 2018 to include all our farms 

and three mills in Burdekin, North 

Queensland. Our efforts to retain 

our Smartcane Best Management 

Practices accreditation for two of our 

Australian farms continue, and we are 

working towards accreditation for two 

additional farms – one targeted for 

2019 and one for 2020 (see page 31 

for more information on certification). 

Wilmar operates one refinery in New 

Zealand and two refineries in Australia 

through a joint venture with Mackay 

Sugar. We also operate two refineries 

in Indonesia. All of our refineries and 

warehouse operations in Australia and 

New Zealand, as well as one refinery 

in Indonesia, have been certified 

against the Bonsucro Chain of Custody 

Standard.

In Australia, third parties (including 

leaseholders and independent 

producers) manage 198,371 hectares 

of our total planted area and delivered 

14,961,969 tonnes of sugarcane to our 

Australian mills in 2018. Meanwhile in 

Myanmar, a total of 36,603 hectares 

was contracted to be managed by 

scheme smallholders in 2018. These 

smallholders supplied 1,310,830 

tonnes of sugarcane to the mill under 

our joint venture, Great Wall-Wilmar 

Holdings. 

Overall, third-party suppliers represent 

97% of Wilmar’s sugarcane supply 

base.

Small Steps Towards 

Big Impact

OUR POLICIES AND PRACTICES 

TO SUSTAINABILITY


Wilmar International Limited

Sustainability Report 2018

29

S

ustainability is firmly embedded 

in Wilmar’s core business strategy 

and operations, and we are committed 

to driving transformation in the 

agricultural sector. In December 

2013, we became the first palm oil 

company to launch an integrated 

No Deforestation, No Peat and 

No Exploitation (NDPE) policy 

extending across the entire supply 

chain. Supported by international 

standards and our multi-stakeholder 

partnerships, this policy has set the 

Group’s overall direction towards 

mitigating deforestation, peat 

development and exploitation.

Also recognising the private sector’s 

responsibility to support and 

build on the commitments of the 

Sustainable Development Goals, we 

have embedded five SDGs into our 

long-term sustainability strategy (see 

page 21). We will continue to measure 

our performance against targets 

aligned with these goals. Overall, our 

NDPE framework and overarching 

sustainability strategy greatly 

overlaps with SDG 12 on Responsible 

Consumption and Production, which 

is one of the most relevant goals to 

our sustainability efforts. Many of our 

existing activities and much of what 

we currently report demonstrates our 

progress towards this goal.

Accelerating NDPE Policy 

Implementation 

Reports by Tropical Forest Alliance 

2020 and Forest Trends show that 

the palm oil industry has made 

significant progress in the last four 

to five years, both in the quality of no 

deforestation commitments and in 

their implementation. At the time of 

reporting, 29% of Indonesia’s leased 

out landbank is protected under the 

NDPE policies of 365 traders and 

Our Approach

to Sustainability

consumer goods companies. This is 

equivalent to 6.1 million hectares, or 

ten million football fields. Meanwhile 

other industry players are lining up 

to adopt their own NDPE policies, 

achieving a level of commitment to 

sustainability that has far surpassed 

that seen with any other agricultural 

commodity.

At Wilmar, we maintain our focus on 

the impact of our oil palm operations 

and drive compliance with our 

NDPE policy at multiple levels. For 

our own operations and for scheme 

smallholders, we pursue continuous 

improvement by strengthening 

standard operating procedures and 

participating in relevant certification 

schemes. In our wider supply chain, 

we use our refineries as central hubs 

for engaging, assessing and enhancing 

supplier performance. Reaching 

beyond our direct supplier mills, the 

scope of our policy extends to group-

level14 oil palm plantations owned by 

companies that we have business 

relationships with.

A key learning from this process is that 

the challenges we face in effective 

policy implementation extend 

beyond the palm oil industry itself, 

and therefore need to be addressed 

holistically through the collaborative 

effort of governments, civil society 

organisations, smallholders, suppliers 

and other industry players. To ensure 

successful implementation, we 

continue to invest significant resources 

to support multi-stakeholder 

partnerships and jurisdictional and 

landscape approaches as part of our 

sustainability strategies. Nevertheless, 

as we implement our policy, we are still 

obstructed by the opaque ownership 

structures used by some companies, 

and recognise that deforestation due 

to oil palm expansion continues to 

occur.

Facing these challenges head on, we 

have re-affirmed our commitment 

to break the link between oil palm 

cultivation and deforestation, peatland 

development and social conflict. In 

December 2018, Wilmar issued a Joint 

Statement with Aidenvironment and 

supporting consumer goods companies 

that details our new supplier monitoring 

and engagement programme. This 

programme has been designed to 

accelerate our efforts towards a 

deforestation-free palm oil industry. 

Effective from 1 January 2019, 

Wilmar will immediately halt 

sourcing from suppliers at the 

group level who are involved in 

verified cases of deforestation and/

or new developments on peatland. 

Suspended suppliers will need to 

meet re-entry criteria that specify 

minimum thresholds for Wilmar to 

consider resuming sourcing. This 

policy supports our recently launched 

timebound action plan to accelerate 

NDPE implementation, which has the 

following three priorities:

1. Higher transparency and 

verification of NDPE compliance 

across the supply chain;

2. Participation in cross-industry 

collaboration to fight deforestation; 

and

3. Monitor labour and community 

issues to ensure no exploitation.

In order to establish a deforestation-

free supply chain from 2020 onwards, 

Wilmar recognises that the provision 

of remediation measures, also known 

as Recovery Plans, is required for 

past non-compliances related to 

deforestation and peat development. 

Adopting a conversion cut-off date of 

31 December 2015 to determine the 

extent of non-compliance, we will 

develop high-resolution forest cover 

and peatland baseline maps for 2016 

14 

Group-level of suppliers is based on the definition of “group” provided by RSPO. In addition, national interpretations will be applicable in the respective regions.

onwards, beginning with Indonesia 

and Malaysia. We expect this work to 

be completed in 2019.

Read more about our Joint Statement 

and NDPE action plan here.

We will also continue working to 

ensure that our commitments and 

approach to NDPE are equally 

relevant and impactful to our sugar 

business. We are currently adopting 

best management practices at our 

mills and will subsequently engage in 

partnerships to encourage changes 

throughout the industry. Our NDPE 

policy was scheduled for review in 

2018 to ensure full alignment with 

our sugar business; however, due to 

limitations in capacity, this has now 

been rescheduled for completion in 

2019. We are currently convening 

public consultation processes relating 

to relevant sustainability policies and 

procedures.

Sustainability Certification

Roundtable on Sustainable Palm 

Oil (RSPO)

As at year-end 2018, 25 of our mills and 

172,047 (76%) hectares of our planted 

area across Malaysia, Indonesia and 

Ghana are RSPO certified. Of the total 

hectarage, 3,690 hectares are owned 

by scheme smallholders. In 2018, we 

produced approximately 681,000# 

tonnes of certified sustainable palm oil 

(CSPO) and around 149,000# tonnes 

of certified sustainable palm kernel 

(CSPK). A further 11,425 tonnes of 

CSPO and 2,929 tonnes of CSPK were 

produced by our plasma smallholders. 

Around 5% of all the palm oil products 

we handle, trade and process are 

RSPO-certified.

As of year-end 2018, 78% of our 

refineries are certified against the 

Timebound plan for outstanding mill certifications as of

31 December 2018

RSPO Supply Chain Certification 

Standard and can deliver palm oil 

products under the Segregated and 

Mass Balance supply chain models. 

We target to complete certification 

for all refineries by 2020.

We continue working to achieve RSPO 

certification for all our estates and mills. 

There has been a decrease in certified 

volumes for our own operations since 

2017 because certificates have expired 

at three of our mills. One of these mills 

is undergoing an ongoing process to 

obtain operation permits, or Hak Guna 

Usaha (HGU); one is in the process 

of resolving a land title issue relating 

to a plasma smallholder that will be 

re-certified in 2019; the third mill 

has been re-certified but is awaiting 

closing out of non-compliances 

before the certificate is obtained.  In 

addition to the issues stated above, 

there are increasing challenges with 

the RSPO certification process due 

to the variable interpretation of the 

certification standard by parties 

involved in the certification process. 

All of Wilmar mills in Malaysia and 

Ghana have been RSPO certified15, 

while the timebound plan for our 

mill in Nigeria is set for 2022. Seven 

of our 25 mills in Indonesia remain 

uncertified due to the ongoing process 

of obtaining operation permits. Our 

target for 100% RSPO certification for 

all mills has therefore been revised 

to 2023. We will continue working 

diligently with all relevant parties to 

overcome these barriers – including 

with the necessary government 

15 

This refers to all Malaysia and Ghana mills as described in the 2013 timebound plan. An additional mill in Malaysia, Suburmas, is operated under a joint 

venture and Wilmar does not hold the majority shareholding. However, the status of this mill was clarified in 2018 as being under Wilmar management 

control according to RSPO Certification Systems requirements. This mill is now included in our timebound plans and is scheduled for certification 

in 2021.

National Palm Oil Certification 

Schemes

The Indonesian Sustainable Palm 

Oil (ISPO) certification is a national 

requirement implemented by 

Indonesia’s Ministry of Agriculture and 

has been applied to all mills since 

2011. As at 31 December 2018, eight 

of our mills and their supply bases are 

certified against the ISPO standard. For 

independent mills, ISPO certification 

is only possible when at least 20% of 

the crop received is certified. Wilmar 

is working with independent FFB 

suppliers and smallholders towards 

achieving ISPO compliance by 2023.

We have been implementing the 

Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil 

(MSPO) certification programme and 

its Principles and Criteria (P&amp;C) for 

our own operations since 2016. We 

certified six additional mills and their 

supply bases in 2018, and after achieving 

certification for the remaining Malaysian 

mill in February 2019, we now operate 

all nine mills under the standard.

In addition, Wilmar is also partnering 

with the Malaysian Palm Oil 

Certification Council (MPOCC) to 

support all of our suppliers as they 

work to achieve MSPO certification 

by the end of 2019 (see page 41 for 

more information).

International Sustainability and 

Carbon Certification (ISCC)

Wilmar is a member of the ISCC 

Association, which promotes the 

sustainable cultivation, processing and 

utilisation of biomass and bioenergy. 

The ISCC scheme is geared towards 

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 

reduction, sustainable land use, 

protection of natural biospheres and 

social sustainability. At the end of the 

current reporting period, 20 mills and 

16 refineries across our biodiesel 

supply chain are certified against the 

ISCC standard.

Bonsucro

Wilmar adheres to the Bonsucro 

Production Standard for its sugarcane 

mills and supply operations, and the 

Bonsucro Chain of Custody Standard 

for all products handled above 

mill level.

As of 31 December 2018, about 

51% of total sugarcane planted area 

owned by Wilmar is certified against 

the Bonsucro Production Standard. 

Our Bonsucro certified sites cover 

Wilmar’s Burdekin farms, as well as 

three of our raw sugar mills in Australia. 

We have also obtained Bonsucro 

Chain of Custody certification for all 

downstream operations in Australia 

and New Zealand, as well as for the 

Jawamanis sugar refinery in Indonesia 

and our sugar trading office in 

Singapore.

Smartcane Best Management 

Practice (BMP) 

Smartcane BMP is a voluntary 

accreditation system for cultivating 

sugarcane in Australia. The system 

provides best practice guidance on 

farming and business management. 

We worked throughout 2018 to retain 

our Smartcane BMP accreditation for 

the farms that we operate in Burdekin 

and Herbert, as well as to secure 

accreditation for our Proserpine farms. 

We will begin the process at our Plane 

Creek farms in 2019, with an aim to 

achieve accreditation in 2020.

Improving Productivity and 

Palm Oil Yields

Improving our productivity, increasing 

our yields and optimising our use 

of resources are all vital strategies 

as we work to fulfil the global 

demand for palm oil. We invest 

significant resources in research and 

development (R&amp;D) to find new ways 

to boost our performance, all the while 

ensuring that our palm oil is produced 

responsibly and sustainably.

Since 2009, we have collaborated with 

Temasek LifeScience Laboratory on 

research to shorten the palm breeding 

cycle through the use of genetic 

screening. Significant progress has 

been made, and we are currently field-

testing genetic markers against FFB 

yields in selected palms. If successful, 

this research may enable us to halve 

the breeding process time compared 

to conventional methods.

This technique is currently housed 

under Wilmar’s palm breeding units. 

We plan to distribute the superior 

seeds throughout our plantations in 

Indonesia, and eventually make them 

commercially available. 

Among other R&amp;D initiatives, we 

are working closely with Orillion, a 

New Zealand-based pest control 

expert, on a new rodenticide. This 

initiative supports our Integrated 

Pest Management (IPM) programme, 

which includes the mass rearing of 

barn owls for biological rat control 

and the use of target-specific rat baits. 

Of these, the solution developed by 

Orillion has been identified as the 

most appropriate. We have also 

been conducting best management 

practice trials in conjunction with the 

International Plant Nutrition Institute. 

This collaboration has produced a 

book – “Oil Palm Best Management 

Practices for Yield Intensification”– 

which was published in 2014 for the 

benefit of the oil palm industry. In 

addition, we are setting up a new 

laboratory in Central Kalimantan to 

explore palm-cloning techniques. This 

facility is expected to be operational 

in the second half of 2019.

Supply Chain

Traceability

A

s the world’s largest palm oil trader, 

and with third parties representing 

over 90% of our total supply base, 

we have both a responsibility and 

an opportunity to lead our supply 

chain towards sustainable palm oil 

production. By tracing supply flows 

we are able to map our supply base, 

evaluate suppliers’ performance 

against our NDPE policy, and engage 

with suppliers to drive continuous 

improvement. We are also able to 

make our supply chain as visible 

as possible to all stakeholders. To 

learn about our approach, visit our 

traceability to mill page. 

We publish a list of our palm oil 

suppliers on an interactive map on 

our website, including company 

names and addresses. Based on the 

2018 KnowTheChain Benchmark 

Report, it was reported that while 

some companies disclose the names 

of selected suppliers, Wilmar is the 

only company out of the 38 studied 

to disclose a full list of its first-tier 

suppliers. We also achieved almost 

double the average company score 

for traceability and risk assessment.

As at 31 December 2018, we have 

achieved 96% traceability to mills. 

Specifically, we have achieved 98.5%# 

traceability to mills in Indonesia, and 

99.4%# traceability to mills in Malaysia. 

In Indonesia, about 10.20# million

to mills. About 5.87# million tonnes of 

CPO and 0.77# million tonnes of PKO 

from our Malaysian refineries were also 

traceable at least to mills. 

Traceability Status in 2018

The majority of palm oil produced 

and traded by Wilmar is sourced from 

plantations and processing facilities 

in Indonesia and Malaysia. However 

our products are often refined 

further in other countries, and we are 

committed to tracing them, regardless 

of destination. In addition to Indonesia 

and Malaysia, European refineries also 

source palm oil products from Latin

We committed to achieving full 

traceability to mills for all palm oil 

physically handled by Wilmar refineries 

by 2015. However, securing full 

traceability remains extremely difficult 

due to the inherent challenges of 

commodity transportation and trading. 

The task is further complicated by 

hesitance on the part of refiners and/

or traders to share information about 

supplying mills. Nonetheless, we 

believe industry attitudes are shifting. 

With Wilmar’s support, this process 

will now be accelerated with the new 

resolution passed at the RSPO General 

Assembly in 2018 requiring members 

involved in primary procurement to 

publish third-party supplying mill lists. 

We also continue to work diligently 

with our suppliers to secure accurate 

information, for instance through 

suppliers’ quarterly self-declaration 

documents.

 

For our palm oil operations, our 

primary focus to date has been on 

traceability to mill. This is because a 

mill is a good reference point for the 

approximate location of its suppliers. 

Due to the multi-tiered nature of the 

supply chain, we have found that 

pursuing traceability further upstream 

is extremely resource intensive and 

can, beyond a certain point, prove 

ineffective, especially as traceability 

information does not in itself address 

environmental or social issues. 

Nevertheless, all palm oil handled by 

Wilmar-owned mills have been 100% 

traceable to plantation since 2014, as 

these mills have been mapped showing 

estate boundaries and the location of 

every smallholder and dealer.

Given that 94% of the raw sugar 

processed through our operations is 

sourced from third-party suppliers, we 

have embarked on a similar traceability 

exercise for both of our origin refineries 

in Australia and have achieved 100% 

traceability# to mill for 2018 sources. 

Through the exercise, we recognise the 

challenges in traceability to individual 

mills along the supply chain due to the 

way in which sugar is processed and 

stored. We will work towards further 

refining this traceability exercise before 

implementation at other operations.

O

ur journey towards sustainability 

began in our own operations 

following the inception of the RSPO 

in 2004. Through the subsequent 

years of trial, error and internal 

troubleshooting we have developed 

an experienced internal team and have 

identified tools and best practices that 

have proven to be effective. Our supply 

chain transformation programme is 

built on this collective experience.

Our internal compliance teams 

continue to conduct annual internal 

audits of our own mills to assess 

compliance against our NDPE policy, 

as well as other sustainability-related 

standards. At the same time, we believe 

that working with our suppliers is 

the best way to tackle the issues of 

deforestation and exploitation in our 

industry.

Since 2013, we have continually 

addressed the risk of non-compliance 

with our direct mill suppliers, of which 

there are about 1,000 globally. We also 

include mills and plantations that we 

do not source from directly, as long 

as they belong to an existing supplier 

group.

To accelerate and intensify our efforts 

towards our target of a deforestation-

free palm oil supply chain from 2020, 

we recently announced that we 

have been working on group-level 

compliance monitoring alongside 

Aidenvironment since 2013. This 

scope of this work includes operations 

that we do not source from directly, 

but which are associated with our 

suppliers.

Compliance at Refinery- and 

Mill-Level

For our NDPE policy to be effective, 

engagement with our third-party 

suppliers and smallholders is key. 

To this end, we have implemented 

initiatives such as the Aggregator 

Refinery Transformation (ART) 

programme and the Supplier Reporting 

Tool (SRT) to assess our suppliers’ level 

of compliance with our NDPE policy. 

Launched in 2014, the ART programme 

was conceptualised as a means to 

strengthen every actor in the supply 

chain. It promotes transformation and 

provides a collaborative framework 

for refiners, millers and growers to 

overcome challenges on the ground. 

ART enables our refineries to provide 

a central point for growers and millers 

to report on their progress towards 

environmental, social and traceability 

targets. The programme incorporates 

a risk screening for supplying mills, and 

has built-in verification assessments 

that assess compliance in sample 

groups of supplying mills selected from 

highest to medium risk categories. 

As part of our progress towards 

having 100% of our supply base 

assessed, we launched the SRT in 

2017 for suppliers that have been 

evaluated to be of lower risk. The 

SRT is an online self-reporting system 

that enables suppliers to report their 

current compliance with Wilmar’s 

NDPE policy. These assessments aid 

our understanding of environmental 

and social risk-related issues within 

our supply chain, including legality; 

identification on high conservation 

value (HCV), high carbon stock (HCS) 

and peat protection; environmental 

impact management; child protection; 

occupational health and safety, 

workers’ rights and labour standards; 

access to grievance mechanisms; 

Free, Prior and Informed Consent 

(FPIC); and traceability.

The SRT was launched in Malaysia, 

Honduras and Guatemala in April 

2018. The results were subsequently 

analysed and action plans have been 

formulated. In September 2018, we 

carried out three supplier engagement 

sessions in Indonesia to introduce SRT 

to our suppliers in Jakarta, Medan and 

Palembang. The SRT was then made 

available in Indonesia, followed by 

Colombia. To date, 429# mills have 

shared their self-assessment results 

using the tool.

Compliance at Group-level

Our NDPE policy has been applicable 

to our suppliers at group-level since its 

launch in December 2013. Since then, 

we have engaged Aidenvironment 

to conduct proactive mapping and 

monitoring of geospatial information 

using regular satellite updates of at-risk 

areas. In December 2018, we raised 

the bar even higher through intensified 

efforts via our new supplier monitoring 

and engagement programme, which 

has been designed to accelerate our 

efforts towards a supply chain free 

from deforestation from 2020 onward. 

The Supplier Group Compliance 

Programme (SGCP) entails a more 

efficient mapping and monitoring 

process and helps to strengthen 

our suppliers’ commitments and 

compliance to our NDPE policy. Key 

priorities of the programme include: 

enforcing NDPE policy with suppliers, 

supplier mapping and monitoring, and 

supplier suspension and engagement. 

Today, the SGCP monitors more than 

14.75 million# hectares. Its scope 

covers 201 parent groups and 750 

mills, representing approximately 

1,500 individual plantations across 

Malaysia, Indonesia and Papua New 

Guinea.

level to provide written confirmation 

of their commitment to adhere to 

our NDPE policy (to be provided by 

Q1 2019), unless they already have an 

acceptable public NDPE policy.

Supplier mapping and monitoring 

The provision of group-level maps has 

been a condition of trade for all new 

suppliers since May 2018. Such maps 

allow comprehensive monitoring of 

potential NDPE non-compliances. 

Under the SGCP, we are supporting 

the development of a Supplier Group 

Mapping Platform, which will contain 

comprehensive data, including 

group-level links, names of subsidiary 

companies, mill capacities, available 

landbanks, as well as written or public 

commitments to our NDPE policy. 

Combined with detailed forest cover and 

peatland baseline maps, and supported 

by high-resolution satellite imagery, 

the mapping database will enable us to 

monitor any land development activities 

undertaken by our suppliers.

Addressing non-compliances 

through grievance procedure and 

supplier engagement

Wilmar launched a Grievance 

Procedure in January 2015 to 

record and investigate reports from 

stakeholders about potential breaches 

of our NDPE Policy by either Wilmar’s 

own operations or our suppliers.

As at 31 December 2018, we have 

ceased sourcing from a total of 17 

suppliers due to non-compliance with 

our NDPE policy. This has resulted in a 

volume loss of more than one million 

tonnes to our operations.

Nevertheless, Wilmar has observed that 

in some cases suspension only moves 

these suppliers to sell to operators that 

do not have NDPE policies. According 

to studies by Chain Reaction Research, 

there has been a growth in “leakage 

markets” outside of NDPE-compliant 

markets. Suspension may also have a 

disproportionate and negative impact 

on smallholders. To mitigate these 

risks, we place equal importance on 

post-suspension engagement to assist 

suppliers in bringing their operations 

back into compliance. Wilmar is 

committed to providing support and 

guidance throughout this process. 

To accelerate our efforts towards a 

deforestation-free palm oil industry, 

new grievances with verified proof 

of deforestation and/or peatland 

development will result in an 

immediate halt of purchases from 

the supplier at group-level. We will 

continue working with the suspended 

supplier to assist them in moving 

towards compliance via timebound 

action plans. Suspended suppliers must 

meet minimum re-entry criteria before 

we are able to resume sourcing. Action 

plans are required to be proportionate 

to the scale of the supplier’s non-

compliant developments, and may 

include options to protect and restore 

forest, bare land and/or peat swamps, 

and to assist local communities to 

secure social forestry rights. 

Existing grievances relating to 

deforestation and/or peat development 

raised before 1 January 2019 will be 

dealt with based on the Grievance 

Procedure released in January 2015.  

In addition, Wilmar will contribute 

to cross-industry collaborations 

and participate actively to develop 

industry-recognised remediation 

and restoration guidelines and best 

practices. Further, we will also support 

integrated action plans designed to 

strengthen forest conservation efforts, 

especially through landscape-level 

programmes and community or 

smallholder programmes.

STAKEHOLDER COMMENTARY BY STOREBRAND ASSET MANAGEMENT

By Tulia Machado-Helland, Senior Legal Adviser, ESG

It is a positive development that Wilmar is joining efforts with Aidenvironment to better monitor its supply chain. 

If properly implemented, the full mapping of Wilmar’s supply chain will increase transparency and allow Wilmar 

to identify those producer groups in violation of the NDPE policy, and in turn provide the tools for Wilmar to 

focus on specific areas or specific supplier groups to help them implement the policy. Storebrand sees this as a 

step in the right direction. Once maps have been established, this needs to lead to action, and we would like to 

see Wilmar take a proactive role. 

Furthermore, the new grievance approach can produce positive results if properly implemented, so that those 

suspended suppliers end up implementing the NDPE policy through a constructive engagement process. Spelling 

out these clear requirements is beneficial to suppliers so that they have the framework to meet the requirements 

before being readmitted into Wilmar’s supply chain. Investors do need transparent information on this process in 

order to monitor progress and be reassured that suppliers are changing their behaviour and actually implementing 

the NDPE policy.

ilmar is actively involved with 

governments, the private sector 

and civil society organisations. These 

partnerships are built on shared 

principles and values for the benefit 

of people and the planet. Aligned 

with SDG 17 – Partnership for the 

Goals – our engagements focus on 

strengthening the means by which 

sustainable practices are implemented 

in our industry and our supply chains.

Collective action by various 

stakeholders at international, regional, 

national and local levels is essential 

for driving transformation in the 

palm oil industry. Wilmar plays an 

increasingly active role in certification 

and assessment organisations, as 

well as in various multi-stakeholder 

platforms that support the production 

of sustainable commodities and the 

elimination of deforestation. We also 

collaborate with international labour 

rights organisations as we work to 

strengthen labour practices in our 

supply chains. Until November 2018, 

we were an active member of the RSPO 

Principles &amp; Criteria Review Taskforce. 

The latest P&amp;C were formally ratified 

and adopted by RSPO members at the 

15th Annual General Assembly on 15 

November 2018.

We continue building partnerships 

to achieve transformation at the 

landscape level. In doing so, we have 

found the collaborative framework 

offered by jurisdictional approaches 

to be highly effective in addressing 

environmental and social constraints 

in land use scenarios.

than 260 mill suppliers representing 

over 55% of the total number of mills 

in Malaysia. To generate impact, we 

rolled out our Supplier Reporting

Responsible Financing

To be a truly responsible business, Wilmar believes that sustainability 

metrics should be incorporated into every aspect of the business. We 

were the first palm oil company to peg the interest rate on loans to our 

performance based on pre-set targets for a comprehensive range of ESG 

metrics. When targets are met, the interest rate on the facility is reduced 

on a tiered basis. The first collaboration was undertaken with ING Bank 

in 2017. Two subsequent partnerships, with OCBC Bank and DBS, were 

undertaken in 2018 with credit facilities totalling US$ 350 million.

Since 2017, Wilmar has collaborated 

with Business for Social Responsibility 

(BSR) and several other global brands 

to run a series of supplier workshops in 

the world’s major palm oil producing 

regions. These workshops focus on 

improving working conditions and 

workers’ livelihoods, and involve 

speaker representatives from the 

government, unions, civil society, 

business organisations, buyers and our 

suppliers. Tailored for Wilmar suppliers, 

these engagements target small 

and medium plantation companies 

with specific focus on their human 

resources personnel. Participants from 

our supplier companies participated 

in the workshops held in Medan, 

Pekanbaru and Jakarta throughout 

2018. Following positive feedback, 

a second phase of capacity building 

workshops is scheduled for 2019.

In 2018, we conducted multiple 

workshops and training sessions. 

These were attended by 910 suppliers 

under the programme with BSR, as 

well as those taking part in the ART and 

SRT programmes. This brings the total 

number of suppliers trained to 1,622 

by year-end, surpassing our target of 

1,000 suppliers to be trained by 2018.

We have also been expanding support 

for communities along our sugar 

and palm oil supply chains. Training 

programmes have been conducted in 

Myanmar for 978 smallholder farmers 

who supply our joint venture, Great

STAKEHOLDER COMMENTARY BY NESTLÉ S.A.

By Emily Kunen, Global Responsible Sourcing Leader, 

Palm Oil &amp; Seafood, Nestrade Procurement Division

Wilmar adopts a proactive approach in being responsive to stakeholders’ 

concerns, and understands our requests when we raise issues or concerns. 

Where there is an allegation or question of an NDPE policy violation within 

the supply chain, they are usually already well informed and have often 

already started to investigate. The Wilmar team typically responds within 

a few hours and often reaches out to stakeholders first, or ensures that 

the information is available on their website through the grievance log. 

In instances where they cannot send out proactive communication until 

matters are clarified, they will at least respond with an informal status 

pending further proactive communications.

About

Wilmar has been one of Nestlé’s long-standing suppliers, both as a direct 

and an indirect supplier. Nestlé works with Wilmar to map and assess 

the supply chain as well as on specific initiatives to address gaps with 

Nestlé’s standard. Emily works on Nestlé’s Responsible Sourcing team, 

which is part of the company’s procurement division. Emily covers the 

responsible sourcing of palm oil and seafood, working with buyers and 

suppliers to ensure that purchased products come from origins that 

meet Nestlé’s responsible sourcing standard.

Constructive Engagement and Collaborative Progress

Wilmar advocates constructive engagement and collaboration with all its stakeholders. We firmly believe this is 

an efficient and progressive means of improving our own business and moving the industry as a whole towards 

becoming more sustainable and responsible.

The publishing of our Joint Statement together with Aidenvironment and supported by major consumer goods 

brands was a direct result of constructive engagement with Greenpeace, and is the outcome of fruitful discussions 

and well-intentioned partnerships that will pave the way for Wilmar in expediting efforts to put in place a supply 

chain that is free from deforestation, peatland development and exploitation.

In the spirit of continuous improvement, Wilmar welcomes all stakeholders, including the NGO community, 

to guide, support and work with us as we identify and resolve gaps and improve the way we operate from a 

sustainability aspect.

While campaigning efforts can be an effective means to bring attention to concerns surrounding the palm oil 

industry, they do not always offer effective and pragmatic solutions, and may even be counter-productive. By 

portraying the entire industry in a negative light, such campaigns omit the genuine and strenuous efforts being 

made by the more sustainable and responsible companies to transform the industry. A more balanced picture 

should also acknowledge the significant benefits that the industry contributes, such as millions of job opportunities, 

developments in education and healthcare, and improvements in living conditions and infrastructure.

Our management and staff use the 

Grievance Procedure as guidance when 

handling grievances filed by external 

parties concerning the implementation 

of Wilmar’s policies. We have standard 

operating procedures (SOPs) in place 

at all sites to handle such cases, which 

are generally overseen by local Human 

Resources departments and are not 

usually registered on the grievance 

list published on our Sustainability 

Dashboard. Exceptions may occur if 

the complainant submits the grievance 

officially through the Grievance 

Procedure, or if an NGO publishes a 

grievance in the public domain on the 

complainant’s behalf. For grievances 

registered by external stakeholders, 

we evaluate each case based on the 

SOP. Grievances will not be registered 

or investigated if they lack supporting 

information or are undergoing legal 

procedure. 

There were 51 recorded grievance 

cases related to our supply chain in 

2018. In the same timeframe we have 

achieved our ongoing target of a 100% 

response rate to all grievances raised 

through the Grievance Procedure. 

From 2019, our public Grievance 

List will also include cases identified 

through our internal monitoring 

process. Where non-compliances are 

confirmed, timebound actions are 

required to be taken by the supplier to 

remain or re-enter our supply chain. 

From Q2 2019 onwards, we will report 

clear information about the progress of 

our suppliers at group-level, relating to:

• 

Availability of written confirmation 

of adherence to our NDPE policy 

or public commitment to another 

NDPE policy;

• 

Accuracy of concession maps 

submitted and updated on the 

group mapping database;

• 

Remaining undeveloped forests 

and peatland within supplier 

holdings at group-level; and

•

and enforce a strict No Burn policy. 

Wilmar acknowledges the major 

risks that climate change poses 

for communities, ecosystems and

third-party suppliers at group-

level. Our practices are aligned 

with the components in SDG 15 – 

Life on Land – and specifically the 

sustainable management of forests, 

combating desertification, halting 

and reversing land degradation, and 

halting biodiversity loss. According to 

ZSL’s SPOTT, Wilmar scored 100% on 

deforestation and biodiversity efforts 

in 2018.

Guided by our NDPE policy, we are 

strongly committed to the use of High 

Conservation Values (HCV) and the 

High Carbon Stock (HCS) Approach to 

identify areas suitable for planting and 

areas to be set aside for conservation. 

Wilmar has always used registered 

HCV and HCS licensed assessors 

to conduct these assessments and, 

following the 2017 launch of the 

integrated HCV-HCSA Assessment 

Manual, we only appoint licensed 

assessors that are able to work with 

the integrated approach. To date, 

we have conducted one such HCS 

Approach assessment, in our Nigerian 

operations, which has subsequently 

undergone the HCS Approach Peer 

Review Process. 

Access the summary and peer review

(JCSC) since its inception in 2016. The 

JCSC assists the Sabah Government 

towards its vision of achieving 100% 

RSPO-certified sustainable palm oil in 

the state by 2025. Wilmar has helped 

the JCSC enlist the support of the 

HCS Approach Executive Committee 

in funding a pilot project to develop 

an HCS Approach assessment at 

the jurisdictional level. This project

“not of concern”, “of concern” and 

“endangered” in accordance with 

Queensland Government laws. 

Approximately 675 hectares have been 

set aside for conservation under this 

system in 2018. 

Wilmar does not operate in 

internationally or nationally designated 

protected areas. Furthermore, if high 

conservation values are present on 

our operational sites, we implement 

appropriate measures to conserve 

them. 

Overseen by our Global Conservation 

Lead, our conservation areas in 

Malaysia, Indonesia, Ghana and 

Nigeria are managed by regional 

conservation specialists. These 

specialists work closely with plantation 

managers to ensure that these 

areas are maintained and, in some 

cases, enhanced in terms of their 

biodiversity value. Their work includes 

monitoring and protecting endemic 

and endangered species and habitats 

from threats such as poaching, illegal 

logging and encroachment. Wilmar 

monitors conservation areas using a 

combination of strategies to ensure 

vigilance and responsiveness, such 

as manual patrolling by onsite teams 

as well as technological solutions. We 

also conduct awareness briefings for 

our workers and community members 

where we socialise the importance of 

reporting encroachment and other 

environmental threats. 

We are also one of the few oil 

palm companies with government-

appointed Honorary Wildlife Rangers 

and Wildlife Wardens. These individuals 

are invested with authority similar to 

that of State Rangers and Wardens, 

and are empowered to stop any illegal 

wildlife activity within our plantations. 

As at 31 December 2018, we have 

70 Wildlife Rangers and Wardens 

operating in Sabah and Sarawak. Ten 

of these posts are filled by women.

Wilmar collaborates in a broad range 

of initiatives to conserve and enhance 

populations of endangered and 

flagship species. Our focus includes 

our own conservation areas and areas 

surrounding our operations. Our work 

with these partnerships can be found

Siamang Rehabilitation Programme, Sumatra

Conservation Area

Location: PT. Kencana Sawit Indonesia (KSI),

Solok, Sumatra

Total planted area: 7,617.34 ha

HCV areas: Bukit Tengah Pulau and Bukit Salo

Total conservation area: 1,760 ha

About Siamangs 

Scientific name: Symphalangus syndactylus

Found in: Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, 

Indonesia, Southern Peninsular Thailand

Interesting facts: Arboreal, with webbed second and third 

toes. Neck vocal pouches produce calls for socialising and 

for defending territories. Social structure consists of 

monogamous pairs that mate for life.

Diet: Leaves, fruits, flowers and insects

IUCN Red List species status: Endangered

Local status: Protected in Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia

Overview of Programme

Our siamang rehabilitation programme was launched in 2014 as a partnership between Kalaweit Foundation and 

our PT. Kencana Sawit Indonesia operations. KSI‘s HCV area forms part of the forest landscapes in which gibbons, 

including siamangs, were once prevalent before becoming locally extinct. The HCV area is home to tree species 

that can provide both habitat and adequate food to support a siamang population. It is also well protected from 

illegal activities such as poaching, logging and encroachment.

Following reintroductions, including the release of eight individuals in 2015, the team from Kalaweit has closely 

monitored the population’s health and behaviour. Positive early results included the birth of two infants, a 

significant milestone that demonstrated successful adaptation by a siamang pair previously rescued from the 

pet trade. The programme has continued to make significant progress in 2018, with 24 siamangs observed in 

two HCV areas at KSI.

It is likely that, over time, more pairs will start breeding. When this occurs, our programme will mark the first 

successful reintroduction of a locally extinct siamang species globally. This would also make it the first successful 

case in which a sustainably managed production landscape contributes to the enhancement of biodiversity in 

a conservation area through provision of a suitable habitat to support the survival of an endangered species.

we have expanded the width of riparian reserves from 20m to 50m in some areas. 

We have also established a monitoring programme to collect data on populations of proboscis monkeys and 

silvered langurs at the Segama river, and this continues to show promise. Early data indicates that both populations 

remain relatively stable#. The monitoring programme is the first of its kind to be conducted in a production 

landscape, and may provide the most secure habitat for the Borneo-specific proboscis monkey, as the area is 

within the boundaries of our estate in Sabahmas.

About The Programme

e take an active role in mitigating 

the occurrence of haze by 

implementing a strict No Burn policy 

within the palm oil operations. Any 

deliberate burning activities for land 

clearing by our suppliers shall result in 

an immediate termination of business 

relations.

All Wilmar operations have onsite 

fire brigades and are equipped 

with firefighting infrastructure 

and equipment. We operate a 

24/7 monitoring system to alert 

us to fires occurring within a five-

kilometre radius of our concessions, 

and conduct fire prevention and 

suppression programmes to reduce 

the incidence and impact of fires and 

haze. Our workers undergo training to 

ensure they remain vigilant and able 

to respond quickly and decisively in 

the event of a fire.

In 2016, we became a founding 

member of the Fire Free Alliance (FFA), 

a voluntary initiative that provides its 

members with a methodology for 

producing a fire risk map five kilometres 

beyond their plantation boundaries, 

among other tools and resources. 

We are actively involved in the Fire-

Free Village Programme (FFVP), a 

community-based incentive scheme 

to help reduce the incidence of fires. 

FFVP provides us with a platform to 

engage with local communities and 

help build their firefighting capacities. 

We also provide communities with 

fire suppression equipment. Since the 

start of our FFA initiative, we have 

conducted socialisation with 145 

villages along the boundaries of our 

plantations in Indonesia. These villages 

are given joint training by the relevant 

government agencies on the use of fire 

suppression equipment and methods 

for extinguishing forest and land fires.

Despite our best efforts, fires may 

occasionally occur in our concessions, 

particularly during the dry season. 

Most of these fires originate from 

enclaves within our concessions that 

are set aside and controlled by small-

scale farmers and local communities 

that continue to practice burning as 

a means to clear land. Some fires also 

originate outside our concession areas 

and spread to our concessions due to 

topography or wind. 

We keep detailed documentation 

on every fire incident, including 

its location, the affected area, the 

action taken, the cause of the fire 

and its duration. We support this 

with photographic records. Police 

reports are filed for all fire incidences 

in Indonesia, as forest burning is a 

criminal offence. 

Our efforts have resulted in a major 

drop in the number of fire incidents in 

recent years. However, in 2018, there 

were 64 reported fires in Indonesia 

– almost three times the number 

recorded in 2017 – affecting 423.25 

hectares within our operations. A 

significant rise in the number of fires 

reported within a five-kilometre radius 

of our concessions was also recorded 

– 98 fires in 2018 compared to 28 in 

2017. Although rainfall for 2018 was 

closer to 2017 levels, a larger affected 

area was reported as our monitoring 

systems have become more advanced 

over the years and are now better 

at detecting and recording fires. Fire 

incidence and total affected areas 

were higher in 2015 due to decreased 

rainfall.

We recorded seven fires in Nigeria and 

Ghana during the reporting period. 

These fires spread into plantations 

from land clearing activities carried out 

by local communities, affecting a total 

of 1.7 hectares of planted area. We are 

developing an SOP on fire monitoring, 

suppression and reporting to mitigate

the impact of such occurrences in 

these countries.

The Use of Fire in Sugarcane 

Cultivation

With guidance from Smartcane 

BMP, we only allow the use of fire 

during cane harvesting, where it is a 

necessary solution in specific contexts 

in sugar cultivation. In our Australian 

operations, the use of prescribed, 

controlled burning is only permissible 

in isolated blocks where there are weed 

or pest issues, or when conditions arise 

that obstruct the normal harvesting or 

irrigation process. 



Activation of Wilmar’s fire fighting team in plantation to control detected fires

In our Burdekin operations, fire is 

used to remove build-up of dead-

leaf trash that is a barrier to irrigation 

water flow. This is the most economic 

and viable solution compared to 

alternative methods. The fires used 

for these burns are relatively clean and 

quick in comparison to smouldering 

trash fires that produces copious 

amounts of blue smoke that lingers 

for hours. Wilmar commits to abide by 

all applicable local regulations, and to 

have robust SOPs in place to govern 

all prescribed burnings.

In 2018, a total of 2,917 hectares 

was burnt in our Australian sugar 

operations using prescribed and 

controlled methods. We discontinued 

burning practices in our Myanmar 

operations in 2017 after having set 

up an overhead irrigation system for 

harvesting.

We will update our NDPE policy to 

include our sugar division and reflect 

these scenarios.

RSPO PalmGHG Calculator

We use the RSPO PalmGHG calculator 

to measure the GHG emissions of our 

RSPO-certified palm oil mills on an 

annual basis, in accordance with the 

requirements of the RSPO standard. As 

there have been substantial changes 

made across the different versions of 

the calculator, historical data cannot 

be used as a definitive indicator of 

year-on-year reductions and/or 

increases in carbon dioxide emissions 

prior to 2016. Version 3.0.1 has been 

used to map our 2018 emissions. We 

recorded a reduction in our overall 

carbon intensity of 0.11 tonnes of 

carbon dioxide equivalent per tonne 

of CPO produced (MT CO2e/MT CPO) 

between 2017 and 2018 for our RSPO-

certified operations. 

In 2018, we see an overall reduction 

of 152,136 MT CO2e in net GHG 

emissions compared to 2017. The 

most significant source of our 2018 

emissions is historical land use change 

Note:  For our 2018 PalmGHG calculations we have included the land area breakdown by types in Indonesia. Therefore, sequestration in conservation area 

figures are significantly higher than 2017 figures, due to the inclusion of Indonesia’s HCV areas for emission calculations. See base data for further details.

The GHG Protocol accounting 

standard is utilised for both our palm

burning bagasse (a by-product of 

sugar milling). This cogeneration 

process generates a total capacity of 

about 199 megawatts. A significant 

portion of the electricity produced is 

exported into the Queensland power 

grid, thereby reducing the region’s 

overall GHG emissions. Three of 

our mills use cogeneration facilities 

to increase their export capacities 

and further drive the efficient use of 

biomass. Surplus bagasse is stockpiled 

on specially designed pads to ensure 

a ready source of renewable energy 

outside the crushing season.

Looking forward, we aim to reduce the 

overall GHG emissions intensity of our 

mills by 15% by 2023. This reduction 

will be measured from a 2016 baseline 

of 0.82 MT CO2e/MT CPO. As at 

31 December 2018, we recorded a 

GHG intensity of 0.72 MT CO2e/MT

of avoidable GHG emissions. To 

reduce our carbon footprint, and in 

line with industry best practice, we have 

invested heavily in the construction 

of methane capture and power 

generation facilities at a number of 

our mills. As at 31 December 2018, we 

have 23 operational methane capture 

facilities at our CPO mills, and expect to 

complete two additional plants in 2019.  

The biogas captured from these 

facilities is used for flaring or 

electricity generation. This provides 

alternative sources of electricity for 

our operations, and helps to reduce 

our overall fossil fuel consumption. An 

operational methane capture facility 

can potentially reduce a palm oil mill’s 

GHG emissions by 90%. 

We initially estimated that once all 

25 methane capture facilities were in 

place, we would achieve an annual 

emissions reduction of more than 

500,00017 MT CO2e. However, we have 

already exceeded this target based on 

the data from our 23 operational mills 

in 2018, where we achieved a total 

POME GHG emissions reduction of 

588,545 MT CO2e.

Peat Conservation and 

Restoration

Wilmar prohibits development on 

peatland, regardless of the depth, in 

accordance with the full scope of our 

NDPE policy and adopts best practices 

in agricultural management to prevent 

soil erosion and degradation. Where 

feasible, we explore options for peat 

restoration by working with expert 

stakeholders and communities. Where 

plantations have been established on 

peat in the past, we work closely with 

expert stakeholders to develop and 

implement remediation measures 

as defined by RSPO and peat 

specialists. These measures include 

the implementation of practices that 

maintain water tables at appropriate 

levels. Around 8% of our planted and 

plasma areas is currently on peat. Most 

of this area is located in our older 

estates in Sumatra.

Together with other key stakeholders, 

we collaborate with Tropical Forest 

Alliance 2020, a global public-

private partnership that, among other 

activities, brings palm oil and pulp 

and paper companies together to 

exchange best practices in peatland 

conservation and restoration. We 

also collaborate with the Indonesian 

Peatland Restoration Agency (Badan 

Restorasi Gambut (BRG)), sharing 

information and supporting progress 

towards their peatland conservation 

target of restoring two million hectares 

of peatland in seven Indonesian 

provinces by 2020.

Safeguarding

Water Quality

W

e recognise the need to carefully 

manage our use of water, an 

essential and finite global resource. 

We have therefore implemented 

comprehensive measures to safeguard 

water quality, increase water efficiency 

and improve water management. 

We are also working to minimise 

the use of potable water across all 

our operations. These measures are 

designed to mitigate any negative 

impacts that our palm oil and sugar 

operations have on waterways.

Managing Effluents

The processing of palm oil results in 

highly polluted wastewater known as 

palm oil mill effluent. POME is often 

discarded in waterways, resulting in 

contaminants that pollute groundwater 

and soil. 

At Wilmar, however, we repurpose 

POME as fertiliser. Applied to land, 

it provides moisture, nutrients and 

organic matter that enhance the soil 

and in turn reduce our reliance on 

inorganic fertilisers. When POME is 

released into local rivers, it is treated 

before discharge. In both instances, we 

comply with local environmental limits 

to minimise any risk of groundwater 

pollution or disturbance to aquatic life. 

Our Central Kalimantan mills have 

recorded higher biological oxygen 

demand (BOD) readings in 2018, 

compared to previous years. Our mills 

generally have higher readings for 

a number of reasons, including the 

impact of repairing existing treatment 

plants, lower rainfall and an increase 

in total suspended solids in clay-

bath water. Our ongoing target is 

to maintain BOD levels below local 

thresholds for all effluent discharged 

to waterways from our palm oil mills. 

All Wilmar operations were compliant 

with relevant local thresholds in 2018.

To mitigate the impact of our sugar 

operations on waterways and 

aquatic ecosystems, our raw sugar 

mills process surplus water and 

effluents through detention ponds 

and sludge plants, or treat them in 

constructed wetlands. Treated water 

is then recycled back to our mills or 

directed to facilities managed jointly 

by local government and the mill 

for further treatment. Treated water, 

and sometimes the effluent itself, 

can also be used for irrigation. We 

ensure that all effluent discharged to 

local waterways is in compliance with 

local regulations on water quality and 

discharge limit requirements. Where 

regulatory requirements do not exist 

for water surplus used for irrigation, 

we follow good practice. This involves 

monitoring water quality to ensure 

suitability for irrigation without long-

term negative impacts to soil.

Water Initiatives for Sugar 

Operations

Wilmar is actively involved in specific 

initiatives in Australia, to address the 

impacts of declining water quality and 

climate change on the health of the 

Great Barrier Reef.

Wilmar is a founding member of the 

Baratta Creek Action Group (BCAG), 

a partnership between sugarcane 

farmers, the government and providers 

of research, development and 

agricultural extension. BCAG captures 

data on nutrients and pesticide loads 

in runoff water to influence on-farm 

activities to improve water flowing to 

the Great Barrier Reef, as well as to 

increase awareness of potential loss

pathways for fertilisers and pesticides 

applied to the land by producers. 

We are also involved in trialling 

approaches to the sustainable use of 

mill by-products through our Cane 

Supply Improvement Programme 

(CSIP). Under this programme, trials 

were conducted from 2016 to 2017 

in Herbert to test different mill by-

product application methods and 

application rates to identify how to 

use these products to improve industry 

profitability while minimising their 

environmental impact. The results 

indicated that banding mill by-

products at low rates, and burying 

them below plant mounds, significantly 

reduces nitrogen and phosphorus in 

runoff water, compared to a broadcast 

application or using higher rates 

of the by-products#. Wilmar has 

convened a working committee of 

technical experts and government and 

industry service providers to develop 

recommendations on the use of mill 

by-products for industry application.

Water Usage

Mills account for the majority of water 

used in our palm oil operations. This 

water is drawn from local waterways 

and wells to process FFB. Aside from 

mills, water is also used for nursery 

irrigation and household use. 

Our 2018 mill water usage levels were 

in line with industry levels across all 

regions. For our palm oil mills, we 

target to reduce water consumption 

intensity to 1.2m3 per tonne of FFB 

processed for Indonesia and 1.3m3 per 

tonne of FFB processed for Malaysia 

and Ghana by 2023. We will set a target 

for Nigeria once we have ensured data 

robustness with the new mill in place.

Our sugar operations in Australia 

source water from nearby surface 

water bodies or artesian bores for 

use in mills. Government approval is 

needed to draw from these sources in 

all cases. In accordance with Bonsucro 

standards, we monitor net water 

consumed per unit mass of product 

for our sugarcane plantations and 

mills, and in 2018 our consumption 

was well within the water usage limits 

set up by the standard. We also try

Reducing

Chemical Use

A

t Wilmar, we work towards 

optimising our use of pesticides 

and implement safeguards to eliminate 

exposure to hazardous chemicals 

for workers, communities and the 

environment. Any use of fertiliser is 

based on a thorough management 

plan, as outlined in our standard 

operating procedure, to ensure its 

optimal use with minimal excess. 

We also incorporate Integrated Pest 

Management (IPM), which combines 

cultural, mechanical, biological and 

chemical strategies to control pests 

while minimising economic, public 

health and environmental risks. 

Recycled palm fronds and other 

organic products are used to increase 

the fixing capacity of soils. 

We closely monitor toxicity within all 

our palm oil operations on a regular 

basis, and undertake strict and detailed 

risk assessments for all substances 

that pose a potential hazard to our 

workers or the environment. Wilmar 

strictly prohibits the use of any 

pesticide categorised as World Health 

Organization (WHO) Class 1A or 1B, 

or those listed by the Stockholm or 

Rotterdam Conventions, except in 

specific situations18. 

Supported by our R&amp;D laboratory in 

Indonesia, we will continue to seek, 

develop and adopt environmentally 

friendly solutions to prevent oil 

palm diseases and improve palm 

growth. We are also working with 

local stakeholders to determine and 

implement alternative pest control 

strategies in our operations.

18 

Wilmar uses some pesticides in the form of pre-formulated mixtures. In these instances, the final classification that we adopt is based on the classification 

set by the manufacturer for the actual formulation. This is explained on page 7 in the document “The WHO Recommended Classification of Pesticides 

by Hazard and Guidelines for Classification 2009” available at http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/classification-pesticides/en/.

Strict Use of Paraquat

The use of paraquat is strictly 

prohibited in our palm oil operations, 

and we enforce this prohibition in 

our joint ventures and with third-

party suppliers. In adherence to this 

policy, all Wilmar businesses involved 

with fertilisers and/or chemicals have 

ceased the selling of paraquat as of 

2018. However, paraquat is still widely 

used in the sugar sector, including in 

our own plantations in Australia and 

Myanmar. This continued usage is due 

to the absence of viable alternatives. 

For our cane operations, and 

specifically in the Australian context, 

paraquat use remains the most 

practical solution and may even curb 

our overall environmental impact. It is 

generally considered as reef-friendly 

when compared to alternative means 

available due to it being a contact 

chemical with no residual activity.

Nonetheless, Wilmar recognises that 

paraquat is a substance of concern, 

and we have established strict 

procedures governing its use. This 

includes only allowing application via 

mechanised spraying, ensuring use of 

personal protective equipment (PPE), 

ensuring conducive climate conditions 

for its use and equipping tractors with 

proper filtration systems. By law, only 

highly trained workers are allowed 

to handle chemical application, and 

their license must be renewed every 

three years. 

We will be clarifying our policies in 

2019 to reflect these strict conditions 

under which paraquat use is permitted 

in our sugar operations.

Worker Safety

All workers handling chemicals 

onsite in our operations are required 

to undergo extensive and regular 

training. The wearing of PPE onsite 

is compulsory, including protective 

eyewear, facial masks, gloves and 

boots. Showering is mandatory after 

each shift, and shower facilities are 

provided at each site. Only authorised 

personnel have access to chemicals, 

which are stored in locked facilities, 

and all containers used for storing 

chemicals are collected, stored and 

disposed of in accordance with legal 

requirements for hazardous waste. All 

workers are subject to regular health 

checks and more information on our 

2018 PPE initiatives is provided on 

page 76.

Monitoring Chemical Use and 

Toxicity

Herbicide use is part of good 

agricultural practice within the palm 

oil sector. The amount of herbicide 

used is largely based on planting 

cycles, with new plantings and young 

crops requiring greater amounts 

compared to mature crops. Local 

climate conditions, pest profiles and 

agricultural and soil conditions are also 

taken into consideration in herbicide 

application. 

We only permit the use of fungicides, 

rodenticides and insecticides in 

specific and urgent situations – such 

as a particularly aggressive outbreak. 

Because these outbreaks occur on a 

random basis, we do not believe it is 

meaningful to monitor the use of these 

pesticides on a year-on-year basis.

For a more accurate assessment of 

our performance against palm oil 

peers, we monitor toxicity levels per 

hectare by region. We track this data 

to ensure that changes in the type or 

volume of herbicides or pesticides 

used do not adversely affect our 

environmental footprint. Comparison 

can be difficult, as only a few oil palm 

plantation companies disclose toxicity 

levels. However, we believe that our 

current range of below 1,000 units per 

hectare is largely in line with industry 

best practice.

Shaping

Our Future

SOCIAL – RESPECTING AND EMPOWERING PEOPLE


Wilmar International Limited

Sustainability Report 2018

64

Empowering People

and Communities

W

ilmar is committed to No 

Exploitation of people and 

communities, and to respect, protect 

and uphold the human rights of every 

worker associated with our business. 

Our position on exploitation is guided 

by international standards, including 

the UN Global Compact, the UN 

Guiding Principles on Business and 

Human Rights, the conventions of 

the International Labour Organization 

(ILO), the Universal Declaration of 

Human Rights and its covenants, the 

United Kingdom (UK) Modern Slavery 

Act, and the Bonsucro Production 

Standards for respecting human 

rights and labour standards. We have 

a Board-approved UK Modern Slavery 

Act Transparency Statement in place 

that was signed off on 1 January 2018.

Wilmar is an active member of the 

RSPO Human Rights Working Group, 

specifically the Labour Taskforce, 

which addresses the rights of plantation 

workers and vulnerable groups. As part 

of the Taskforce, we strongly supported 

the definition and methodology for a 

sector-specific living wage standard 

that was adopted under the revised 

RSPO P&amp;C in November 2018. We have 

also contributed to the development 

of the RSPO Policy on Human 

Rights Defenders, Whistleblowers, 

Complainants and Community 

Spokespersons, which was adopted 

by the RSPO Board of Governors in 

September 2018.

Wilmar sits on the HCS Approach Social 

Requirements sub-groups relating to 

Labour Rights and the Application 

of Social Requirements to Existing 

Operations. We are currently working 

to formalise these as part of the 14 

HCS Approach Social Requirements, 

11 of which were adopted by the HCS 

Approach Steering Group into the 

methodology in November 2018.

In line with our new action plan to 

accelerate NDPE compliance, we 

have been conducting a thorough 

review of the work that has been 

undertaken to date to identify ways 

to strengthen labour practices. Wilmar 

will be designing a framework for 

implementing social audits across our 

entire supply chain to demonstrate 

compliance (or otherwise) with our 

No Exploitation policy. Independent 

community and labour assessments 

aligned to this audit framework are 

being conducted in early 2019. These 

will be followed by a timebound action 

plan to monitor labour and community 

issues pertinent to our No Exploitation 

commitments.

In Myanmar, Social Impact 

Assessments (SIAs) were conducted 

in 2015 covering our sugarcane and 

sugar plant operations. The SIAs 

did not identify any critical issues 

related to the labour force, and are 

now focused on potential impacts 

to nearby communities. While there 

have been delays on reporting the 

SIAs due to circumstances with the 

hired consultants (final reports were 

received in late 2018 only), we are still 

working closely with the local team to 

ensure that increasingly reliable data 

is available on labour conditions in 

Myanmar.

Decent Work and Economic 

Growth

Our employees form the backbone 

of our operations, and we see it 

as our responsibility to provide 

good livelihoods and development 

opportunities for all our workers and 

their families. In line with SDG 8 on 

Decent Work and Economic Growth, 

we have been rolling out reforms 

since 2017 to entrench good labour 

practices throughout our operations. 

These include converting temporary 

employment contracts to permanent 

contracts, restructuring wages, and 

reinforcing gender equality. Health 

and safety standards have also been 

a priority. 

We have in place the following labour 

and human rights policies: Human 

Rights, Child Protection, Occupational 

Health and Safety, Equal Opportunity 

and Sexual Harassment, Violence 

and Abuse, and Reproductive Rights. 

Our Human Rights Policy guides our 

approach to due diligence within the 

supply chain. It also guides our strategy 

of using partnerships and platforms 

to monitor labour risks linked to 

our suppliers at plantation-, mill- or 

group-level. For our sugar business, 

we have additional policies covering 

Environmental Health &amp; Safety and 

Injury Management. 

Collaborations with international 

organisations and multi-stakeholder 

partnerships that specialise in labour 

rights also play a key role in our efforts 

to strengthen labour practices. In 

March 2018, Wilmar, Cargill, Golden 

Agri-Resources, Musim Mas and 

Sime Darby Plantation established 

the Decent Rural Living initiative, 

convened by Forum for the Future. 

The aim of the initiative is to improve 

the protection of human and labour 

rights in the agriculture sector by 

delivering practical and realistic 

recommendations to support rural 

workers and secure their long-term 

ability to thrive. Cross-industry and 

stakeholder partnerships will be 

established to address worker-centric 

barriers and going beyond compliance. 

More information can be found in this 

joint statement.

We also collaborate with key 

partners such as Business for Social 

Responsibility (BSR) on collective 

actions to improve working conditions 

and livelihoods across the palm oil

supply chain in Indonesia. These 

actions include capacity building 

programmes and supplier workshops. 

More information can be found on 

page 41.

Wages and Benefits

We pay fair wages to all employees 

and comply with minimum wage 

regulations, at the very least, for our 

lowest paid workers for all palm oil and 

sugar plantations, mills and refineries. 

This applies to both full-time and 

temporary workers that are subject 

to key performance indicators (KPIs). 

In 2018, all our workers received 

wages19 of at least the applicable 

minimum wage for our palm oil 

operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, 

Nigeria and Ghana. All permanent 

workers are also provided with free 

housing for themselves and their 

immediate families, as well as other 

benefits, such as facilities for children, 

including playgrounds, daycare 

centres for children of pre-school age, 

and access to education for children 

of school-going age. All workers in 

Malaysia, Indonesia and Ghana have 

access to onsite accommodation for 

those who require housing. Those 

who stay offsite do so by their own 

choice. As our operations are still 

developing in Nigeria, only 11% of 

permanent workers are provided with 

accommodation in our estates as of 

year-end 2018. We target to provide all 

workers with accommodation choices 

by 2025.

Over the years we have seen a steady 

increase in workers’ pay throughout 

the industry, and we are committed 

to driving further improvements by 

incentivising the harvesting of quality 

fruit. We are also introducing a formal 

policy on overtime work on official 

rest days. In parallel to the initiatives 

implemented above, we are also 

collaborating with peer companies 

on the decent living wage for workers 

and plan to conduct an external 

assurance of wage payments as part 

of the programme.

Through work with our partner Verité, 

we are looking to calculate work 

completed after regular hours for 

piece-rate workers with the aim of 

better compensating work rendered 

upon exceeding the minimum 

productivity output. We are also 

considering alternative measures to 

financial penalties for breaches in 

company regulations on discipline 

and performance. Such measures 

may include switching our approach 

to positive reinforcement for non-

breaches. Now that payslips are 

available in Bahasa Indonesia, our 

New Strategic Plan With Verité To Strengthen Labour Practices

Wilmar began collaborating with Verité in 2017 with an aim to develop robust and sustainable solutions to labour 

issues in our operations and the wider palm industry. We subsequently underwent a 12-month programme, aligned 

with international standards and global market demands. Since then, we have been working with Verité to raise 

awareness on human rights and labour issues in plantations, specifically in the Indonesian context. We have set 

up systematic sustainability goals and have developed a strategy to change mindsets and entrench sustainability 

as the priority approach for our company.

In January and August 2018, two workshops were organised with the key managerial and operations staff at 

PT. Daya Labuhan Indah (DLI) and PT. Perkebunan Milano (Milano). The focus of these workshops was strategic 

planning and problem solving in teams. The outcomes from the first workshop were working drafts of three-year 

strategic objectives, a three-year plan, and a 2018 action plan. The second workshop involved an assessment of 

the sustainability framework’s coherence in light of the three-year strategic objectives. 

As a result of these workshops, the following priorities were identified for mitigating the risk of recurring serious 

labour issues: 

• Exploring the possible root causes of child labour;

• Understanding the link between work and pay practices; and 

• Screening for emergent labour issues.

Moving forward, we plan to launch the programme throughout Indonesia to both strengthen Wilmar’s sustainability 

structure and design value-based labour and community engagement initiatives.

focus is shifting to ensure that workers 

understand the pay system, and to 

empower them to be more active and 

engaged in their involvement with 

the business. We are working with 

unions to provide clarification of the 

link between KPIs and wages.

In our sugar operations in Australia, 

New Zealand and Myanmar, we also 

pay workers at least the applicable legal 

minimum wage, and are in compliance 

with labour rules and regulations 

covering overtime and breaks.

Under Australian legislation, sugar 

employees may have higher minimum 

wages based on the sugar industry 

award agreement. Wilmar also has 

an enterprise agreement, which is a 

tailored collective agreement made at 

enterprise-level between employers 

and employees that stipulates pay 

rates higher than award wages. 

All employees are provided wage 

information through common law 

contracts. These contracts are tested 

against national employment standard 

wages to ensure our contract rates 

exceed standard rates.

In Myanmar, our employees are 

provided with additional benefits, 

including staff housing and meal 

allowances. While the majority of our 

workers are paid directly by Wilmar on 

a daily rate, some workers are sub-

contracted through an independent 

agency (mainly those working in 

planting, harvesting and the application 

of fertilisers and herbicides).

in providing services for specialist and 

timebound jobs. Overall, we continue 

to reduce the number of temporary 

workers in our operations in line with 

responsible employment practices. 

We have already made great progress 

towards this goal in North Sumatra. 

As of October 2018, there are no 

temporary contract holders in PT. DLI 

and PT. Milano in the region, and we 

are working towards the same goal 

at our other estates. The conversion 

of temporary contract holders 

to permanent contract holders is 

consistent with Wilmar’s overall efforts 

countrywide.

As at December 2018, 90.4% of our 

workers in Indonesia hold permanent 

employment status. We have achieved 

100% conversion of temporary 

contracts to permanent contracts 

in Central Kalimantan, and 90.5% in 

Sumatra. Only 65.2% of our workers 

in West Kalimantan are of permanent 

status. 

Our Nigeria operations embarked 

on a large-scale exercise in 2018 to 

fill gaps created by dead seedlings. 

Many temporary jobs were created 

for this purpose, and people from 

nearby communities were recruited 

to help. We expect this exercise to 

be completed by end-2019 or 2020.

As sugarcane is a seasonal crop, a large 

proportion of the workforce in our 

sugar plantations is temporary and 

composed of seasonal workers. While 

many seasonal workers in Australia are 

locals, non-locals must undergo checks 

to prove they are permitted to work and 

reside in the country. In recent years, 

cases of exploitation involving foreign 

seasonal workers have been reported, 

raising concerns in the Australian media 

and among public, government and civil 

society stakeholders. To our knowledge, 

these cases are not related to the sugar 

industry.

Equal Opportunity

Wilmar is committed to the principle of 

equal opportunity for each employee. 

In line with our Equal Opportunity 

Policy, we do not discriminate based on 

race, colour, gender, age, social class, 

religion, sexual orientation, politics, or 

disability when making decisions on 

hiring, promotion or retirement.

Given the vast cultural differences 

between the countries and regions in 

which we operate, gender distribution 

among workforces varies greatly. 

In Malaysia, the number of women 

employees in Wilmar’s operations is 

largely proportionate to the relatively 

high participation of women in the 

general workforce. This can be 

compared to other regions where 

women have less access to the formal 

labour market. In some countries, such 

as Australia, agriculture tends to be 

a male-dominated industry and our 

operations reflect this trend.

We seek to ensure that pay and 

conditions are equal for men and 

women. However, we recognise 

that many women in our oil palm 

plantations are on temporary rather 

than permanent work contracts for 

the purposes of having flexible working 

hours to manage domestic and 

childcare responsibilities. In Central 

Kalimantan, where all temporary 

workers have now been converted 

to permanent status, we have ensured 

that all female workers can now enjoy 

maternity benefits. Menstrual leave 

application processes have also 

been made easier and less intrusive. 

All benefits and subsidies paid out to 

women are now on par with those 

paid out to our male workforce.

In January 2018 Oxfam, Serikat Buruh 

Perkebunan Indonesia (Serbundo) 

and Kapal Perempuan conducted 

onsite research in PT. DLI focusing 

on the working conditions of women 

employees and their reproductive 

rights in oil palm plantations. Several 

key stakeholders were interviewed, 

including representatives from 

company management, medical 

officers and, most importantly, female 



Training for women workers

workers. The researchers concluded 

that the following conditions could 

be further improved within Wilmar’s 

operations:

• 

Provision of basic adult education 

for women and men;

• 

Protection of reproductive health 

rights;

• 

Engagement to socialise the 

concept of gender equality in the 

estate;

• 

Safeguards for the security 

and safety of female workers 

and female-specific grievance 

processes; and 

• 

Empowerment through the existing 

Gender Committee, and increasing 

female representation in general.

We have started to build improvements 

that specifically address these gaps 

into our management workplans 

for enhancing gender equality in 

our operations and estates. Gender 

sensitisation is also a component of 

our three-year strategy developed 

with Verité.



Meeting of the Women’s Committee in one of our Malaysia estates

We have already established Women’s 

Committees across our estates in 

Malaysia, Indonesia and Ghana. 

These ensure female representation, 

regardless of labour or workers’ 

association. In Nigeria, we target to 

establish Women’s Committees for 

100% of all estates by end-2019. 

In 2018, we began work to standardise 

the focus of Women’s Committees at 

estate-level in Malaysia. This includes 

setting up a specific taskforce to look 

at the key issues of child care in our 

crèche centres, as well as collating 

women- and family-specific data for 

each of our estates. In 2019, we will

Sustainability.

Caring for Children in Our 

Plantations

We launched our Child Protection 

Policy (CPP) in November 2017. The 

CPP supersedes our  longstanding No 

Child Labour Policy, and is formulated 

to address issues of children’s rights 

and welfare in a more holistic way. It 

specifically enjoins us to ensure that 

all children in our plantations, schools 

and facilities, as well as those under 

the care of our third-party suppliers 

and contractors, are provided with 

safeguards and protection from abuse 

and exploitation. The CPP is guided by 

global standards, including ILO and 

UNICEF, and includes remediation 

actions for instances where child 

labour has occurred. 

In September 2018, we were 

recognised by Global Child Forum 

for the improvements we have 

made, ranking number one in their 

Corporate Responses to Protecting 

Children’s Rights in Southeast Asia 

report. The Global Child Forum is 

a non-profit foundation initiated in 

2009 by the Swedish royal family as an 

independent platform for promoting 

action on children’s rights. The report 

commended our CPP, particularly in its 

provision of a remediation plan should 

incidents involving child labour come 

to light in our own or our suppliers’ 

operations. The report further 

highlights our efforts in providing 

various facilities and other benefits 

for our workers’ children, including 

schools in many estates. 

Child Safety

Building on the CPP, a review of our 

plantations and operations from 

the perspective of child safety was 

completed in July 2018. This included 

an assessment using the Hazard 

Identification, Risk Assessment, and 

Risk Control (HIRARC) approach.

The child safety assessment has been 

shared with plantation operations 

management, and we are currently 

developing a cohesive child safety 

programme to ensure that safety 

measures are in place and are 

consistently applied. The programme 

will focus on:

• 

Educating caretakers and children 

about safety risks and mitigation 

measures;

• 

Designing safer environments for 

children; and

• 

Continuously reviewing children’s 

interactions with the immediate 

surroundings and identifying 

potential safety risks.

This programme will be rolled out 

across all Wilmar estates.

Specific safety improvements for 

crèche facilities were also implemented 

in 2018. Focus was placed on all 

aspects of childcare, including hygiene. 

A checklist of minimum standards was 

developed for childcare workers based 

on a dedicated crèche safety review 

conducted in April 2018, and this has 

now been incorporated as part of their 

daily routine. Additional training was 

also provided for childcare workers to 

ensure a minimum standard of care 

is provided. This initiative has been 

incorporated as a set programme 

under the sub-committee of Women’s 

Committee (Women and Children 

Committee) and is being rolled out 

across Wilmar’s operations from 2019.

School Attendance for Children 

Living in Plantations

 

We believe that by providing access 

to quality education for all children, 

and from a very young age, we can 

empower them to build meaningful 

and prosperous lives. All children 

of compulsory school-going age 

that live in Wilmar’s plantations are 

required to attend full-time education 

programmes. Our conviction is 

reflected in SDG 4 on Quality 

Education.

attend. As at 31 December 2018, 

there are about 12,400 children of 

compulsory school-going age living in 

our oil palm plantations in Indonesia, 

Malaysia, Nigeria and Ghana. In 2018, 

we recorded that around 84%# of these 

children attend school20, and we target 

to secure 100% attendance at schools, 

education programmes or equivalent 

by 2025.

As part of our efforts to provide 

access to quality education, we have 

embarked on a school redevelopment 

programme. More information can be 

found on page 86.

In 2017 we had reported that around 88.3% of 

children at school-going age who are living in 

Wilmar’s plantations attend school. We have 

revised figures for 2018 due to improved data 

accuracy with Wilmar’s census exercises and 

expanded scope of the verification process.

Provision of Crèches throughout Wilmar’s Estates

The childcare nursery at Sapi Estate is one of 45 Wilmar-run crèches in its Malaysian operations. These nurseries 

make it possible for plantation workers like Zubaidah Kama, who is from Indonesia, to work and supplement 

their household income and savings. While Zubaidah carries out her task as a sprayer until 2pm, her son is cared 

for by trained workers. This benefit was not available when she had her first two children some 20 years ago. 

Wilmar works closely with the well established Women and Children Committee to meet its sustainability goals 

and policies. This includes ensuring that there are sufficient crèches and primary schools at its estates in Sabah 

and Sarawak.

In the early days, crèche employees were only provided with basic training. Through continuous feedback from 

employees and external parties, Wilmar and the Committee saw the urgency of focusing on the learning needs 

of children and detailed safety requirements, as well as equipping caregivers with the right knowledge. In 2018, 

we carried out in-depth training on the CPP to Wilmar crèche caretakers and nannies with a primary focus on 

child safety and handling. A series of meetings was held with the main Committee to define and introduce the 

role of a dedicated crèche sub-committee. This sub-committee allows for easier reporting to the management 

on crèche-related issues and to facilitate regular updates on crèche matters and child welfare. Wilmar is also 

rolling out a crèche inspection form and daily checklist for all crèches in its Malaysian operations. 

In August 2018, selected Wilmar crèche workers visited two established nurseries and kindergartens in Kota 

Kinabalu to learn more about best childcare practices. They picked up tips on meal plans, safety and health 

checks. Following their visit, crèche workers understood the need to introduce educational, play-based activities 

for children. They had also learned effective communication methods. The Committee will continue to monitor 

crèches and improve this facility by interacting regularly with crèche sub-committees, parents and estate 

management. Wilmar hopes to extend the crèche model implemented successfully in its Malaysian operations 

to its other locations in Indonesia and Africa.

Bonded Labour

In line with our NDPE policy, RSPO 

requirements and the ILO core labour 

standards, we do not permit any 

forced, trafficked or bonded labour 

in our operations or supply chain. 

Wilmar employees are not subject to 

the unlawful withholding of wages, 

identification cards, passports or 

travel documents, or other personal 

belongings without consent. We provide 

secure locker facilities for our workers 

to store their personal belongings.

Within our palm oil plantation and mill 

operations, we ensure that we recruit 

workers directly and without engaging 

third party agencies, where there are 

higher risks of force or coercion. The 

agents we do use are only contracted 

for administrative and logistical 

purposes, but full responsibility for 

payment is borne by Wilmar. In cases 

where team leaders are required to 

assist in the recruitment of local 

workers, they are paid an incentive 

to do so. While agents are commonly 

used for this purpose in Ghana and 

Nigeria, we regulate the process and 

do not permit the agent to request 

monetary deposits or other collateral 

as a condition of employment. We also 

ensure that these appointed agents 

comply with our NDPE policy. 

We recognise the risk of forced 

labour occurring beyond our own 

operations, and have adopted a risk-

based approach to due diligence. 

This approach is informed by our ART 

and SRT traceability programmes and 

ensures our policies are socialised 

throughout all associated operations.

The human rights and labour provisions 

of the Bonsucro Production Standard 

have been socialised throughout our 

sugar operations to eliminate the risk 

of forced or compulsory labour. The 

provisions apply to all workers on mill 

and farm premises, including contract 

workers. In Myanmar, our labour head 

is subcontracted to hire workers for 

daily operations. In Australia, our farms 

operate in a heavily unionised and 

legislated environment where strong 

trade union involvement ensures that 

labour is voluntary and that employees 

are free to terminate employment at 

any time.

KnowTheChain’s 2018 Benchmark 

Report reviewed the forced labour 

policies and established procedures 

at 38 of the largest global food and 

beverage companies. The report 

concludes that despite increasing 

adoption of the UN Guiding Principles 

on Business and Human Rights, there is 

a noticeable lack of remedial actions in 

the sector. In fact, of the 12 companies 

for which KnowTheChain identified 

forced labour allegations, Wilmar was 

one of only three to have outlined the 

steps taken to address the allegations. 

We were also the only company to 

disclose remedy outcomes for workers.

We will conduct a risk assessment 

exercise for labour issues within our 

sugar supply chain in due course. 

Employee Engagement and 

Complaints Mechanisms

An appropriate complaints mechanism 

and process for addressing grievances 

is in place for all Wilmar employees, 

including permanent and temporary 

workers. All plantation and mill units 

have site-specific complaints and 

grievances procedures, which have been 

a requirement of the RSPO P&amp;C since 

2005. These site-specific procedures 

are accessible to workers as well as 

other stakeholders. Employees can 

address verbal or written complaints to 

their supervisor or union representative, 

or make an anonymous complaint using 

an onsite feedback box.

Employees are made aware of the 

grievance process at the point of 

employment and receive regular 

reminders via online and offline 

channels. They are also issued an 

employee handbook that outlines 

the grievance mechanism. Women 

committees have been established 

across our oil palm plantations to 

ensure that women can raise concerns 

and access support.

A 2016 BSR assessment found that 

workers in Indonesia had a low 

level of awareness about grievance 

mechanisms, and were unclear whether 

temporary workers were covered. To 

address this, we are working with the 

RSPO to trial a mobile telephone-based 

grievance reporting tool called Ulula 

across our estates in 2019.

Freedom of Association and 

Union Relations

Wilmar respects the right of all 

employees to form and join trade 

unions and to bargain collectively. 

Unions are our key stakeholders in 

ensuring that we understand and 

appropriately address the concerns 

and grievances of our employees. 

Workers can also utilise the union as 

a grievance channel or for collective 

bargaining purposes. Our engagement 

with unions supports our ambition 

to continuously strengthen labour 

practices in our operations.

While our estates and mills have 

established forms of labour 

representation, most refineries do not 

have such associations. Therefore, in 

the absence of any proper collective 

agreement or association, Wilmar 

does not restrict workers from joining 

other unions. We also provide parallel 

means for workers to participate in 

independent free association and 

bargaining.

STAKEHOLDER COMMENTARY BY CNV INTERNATIONAAL

By Karen Bouwsma, CSR Advisor

By Amalia Falah, Country Representative (Indonesia)

Wilmar’s proactive approach to working with labour unions in Indonesia is commendable and they have made 

great progress. 

One of Wilmar’s biggest challenges is the size of its business, which opens it up to risks in the supply chain and 

presents difficulties in managing social issues. While it is positive that Wilmar has been more open to critical NGOs 

and trade unions, and tries to involve them in solutions, this may complicate implementation. 

CNV sees opportunities for Wilmar and the industry to connect better through trade unions with a common 

agenda and approach. By having an improved structure to manage suppliers, and by collaborating more with 

trade unions, there will be stronger support for the industry in becoming more sustainable on labour issues. 

Wilmar should use this opportunity to collaborate with trade unions and GAPKI, who are present in every region, 

to conduct pilots. 

An eventual solution could be for Wilmar to encourage the Indonesian government to adopt a new and innovative 

approach, such as multi-company collective bargaining agreements, with the help of critically constructive unions. 

This could be a good opportunity for Wilmar, as its size gives it the means to have this type of conversation with 

governments as well as suppliers.

About

Wilmar collaborates with CNV Internationaal through Hukatan-KSBSI on collective bargaining agreements. 

Karen worked with CNV Internationaal for 10 years and was the CSR Advisor for the Netherlands team. Her work 

included supporting colleagues in their respective regions and local trade union partners/programmes in line 

with theories of change, CSR covenants, OECD and UNGP guidelines. Amalia represents CNV Internationaal 

within the Indonesia context. In the palm oil sector, CNV has one project with the trade union Hukatan, which 

is affiliated to KSBSI, the Indonesian Trade Union Prosperity, and Amalia works with these organisations on the 

ground. Her work, together with ILO, facilitates the Palm Oil Trade Union Network, Japbusi, which consists of 

nine federations and four confederations, bridging this network to the Indonesian Palm Oil Association (GAPKI),

have three established Perjanjian 

Kerja Bersama, or collective labour 

agreements (CLAs), and one that is 

currently undergoing negotiations. 

These CLAs provide clarity on the link 

between KPIs and wages and are valid 

for workers who are union members. 

CLAs are negotiated between 

worker or union representatives and 

management.

Through our work with Serbundo (a 

North Sumatra–based union affiliated 

with the International Union of Food 

Workers) we have established a CLA 

for PT. DLI and PT. Milano in North 

Sumatra. We have also established 

multi-site CLAs for PT. Bumi Pratama 

Katulistiwa in West Sumatra, and PT. 

ANI Sambas in West Kalimantan, 

in partnership with HUKATAN-

Konfederasi Serikat Buruh Sejahtera 

Indonesia (KSBSI), a national union 

affiliated to the Dutch federation CNV.

In our sugar business, we have a CLA 

in place for our refinery in Indonesia, 

PT. Refined Jawamanis. Negotiations 

are currently ongoing at PT. Murni Sam 

Sam in Riau, and we are confident 

that a new CLA will be in place soon.

We hope to be able to introduce 

our CLA format in other operations 

throughout Indonesia, though this 

may be a time-consuming affair 

as CLAs are valid for two years 

upon negotiation and approval by 

the regional representative of the 

Indonesian Manpower Ministry. 

Throughout 2018, we have focused 

on sharing our extensive knowledge 

and experience of labour relations 

with our stakeholders. In February 

2018, Wilmar and Serbundo hosted 

a delegation of Belgian government 

officials at Wilmar’s PT. DLI, where 

our progress in strengthening labour 

practices was showcased. Addressing 

the delegation, the Serbundo leader of 

PT. DLI explained the various changes 

and improvements we have achieved 

in partnership. Both Hukatan-KSBSI 

and Serbundo participated as expert 

union commentators at the series 

of capacity-building workshops 

conducted by BSR for Wilmar’s 

suppliers.

In early 2018, we opened our doors 

to CNV to film a short documentary 

in our PT. Murini Sam Sam estate 

in Riau. The documentary includes 

recorded interviews with our workers. 

The video is available in both English 

and Bahasa Indonesia, and is a 

testament to the constructive social 

dialogue and positive outcomes of 

this partnership. Our next step is to 

build on this momentum by facilitating 

conversations and collective action 

between unions and our suppliers. 

About 26%# of the workers in our 

Indonesian operations, from estates 

to refineries, are formally covered by 

collective bargaining agreements. 

Malaysia, Ghana and Nigeria

Our Malaysian operations are not 

unionised, but we have ongoing 

engagements with workers on 

conditions and pay. For collective 

bargaining purposes, 100%# of our 

estates have a Social &amp; Welfare 

Committee in place, with established 

SOPs to discuss matters such as 

wages. The Committee meets three 

times a year, is chaired by the manager 

of the estate or mill, and is attended 

by both management and worker 

representatives.

Excluding managerial staff (who are 

precluded from union membership 

to prevent conflicts of interest), 100%# 

of our permanent workers in Ghana 

are unionised. About 70%# of our 

permanent workers in Nigeria are 

unionised. This figure is based on 

overall employee data which include 

staff and management.

Australia, New Zealand and 

Myanmar

Union rights and collective bargaining 

rights are well embedded in Australia 

and New Zealand. A large percentage 

of our workforce is unionised, and there 

are collective bargaining agreements 

in place. Some of our sugar suppliers 

are Bonsucro certified, and we are 

therefore confident that they also 

have such practices in place, as it is 

a core requirement under indicator 

2.1.4 (Respect the right of all workers 

to form and join trade unions and/or 

to bargain collectively). Furthermore, 

100%# of our waged employees in 

Australia are covered by an industrial 

agreement (Award or Enterprise 

Agreement), while the remaining staff 

and managerial employees are covered 

through stand-alone contracts.

Unions also play a significant role in 

our Myanmar operations, particularly 

in securing legislated protection and 

rights for workers. We have a robust 

framework and process in place for 

determining rates of pay, and these 

include regular negotiations with 

trade unions. There is one major 

union worker association present at 

our farms and mills in Myanmar, of 

which roughly 28%21 of our workers 

are currently members.

Health and Safety

Wilmar is committed to providing 

a safe working environment for all 

employees, and upholding health and 

safety standards remains an ongoing 

priority. In accordance with our Health 

and Safety policy, we ensure all health 

and safety measures and facilities are 

up-to-date and conduct occupational 

safety and health training for our 

workers on a regular basis.

For our palm oil operations, our 

emphasis for 2018 was on improving 

the efficacy of personal protective 

equipment (PPE). This focus has driven 

the implementation of new SOPs for 

working during haze occurrences 

and for reducing workers’ risk of 

exposure to chemicals. All workers 

are provided with PPE, and while 

the tropical climate we operate in 

can restrict the type of PPE that is 

suitable, we never compromise on 

worker safety when choosing the right 

equipment. As part of our continued 

efforts to inculcate a safety mindset, 

our workers are reminded repeatedly 

of the importance of PPE at work. In 

2018, we completed a Group-wide 

PPE best practice review, where best 

practices from around the various 

Wilmar operations were shared for 

internal alignment and improvement.

We have also developed an Air Pollution 

Emergency Response procedure 

for our workers who risk exposure 

to smog resulting from forest fires, 

which is not an unusual occurrence 

in Indonesia. This SOP is under the 

purview of the emergency response 

team managers at each plantation, and 

covers several situations, including:

 

1. Ensuring adequate PPE is provided, 

such as N95 respirator masks;

2. Having special provisions for 

workers with heart or respiratory 

problems;

3. An outline of when stop-work 

orders will be issued; and

4. Procedures for medical treatment 

and emergency evacuation of 

workers and their family members 

arising from air pollution.

This SOP is being socialised throughout 

Wilmar’s plantations in Indonesia to 

support operational preparedness 

among management and workers 

(including healthcare workers) during 

haze events.

We are also undergoing trials for 

mandatory rotation systems for 

workers that handle pesticides in 

North Sumatra. While we always 

conduct regular medical checks for 

chemical sprayers, and give workers 

access to their tests, we are now 

our increasing efforts to minimise 

prolonged exposure and maintain 

safe chemical levels in our workers’ 

bodies. The rotational system requires 

workers who work with pesticides 

to be switched every three months 

to work with no chemical exposure. 

Once successfully implemented in 

North Sumatra, the rotation system 

will be scaled up and implemented 

across our plantation operations.

We provide free healthcare from 

Wilmar-funded estate clinics to all 

permanent and temporary workers 

and their families across all our estates. 

Permanent workers are also covered 

by medical insurance, dental care 

benefits and subsidies on spectacles, 

dentures and hearing aids. Regular 

checks are conducted for our mill 

employees that work in areas with 

elevated noise levels. All onsite doctors 

prioritise clear communication when 

explaining medical procedures and 

test results. All workers have access 

to healthcare facilities, including 

health insurance, onsite clinics, and 

transportation to and from clinics 

and/or hospitals (for emergencies). 

Our ongoing target is to ensure all 

estate and mill workers have access 

to healthcare.

LTIFR per 200,000 working hours (sugar operations)

We work persistently to reduce the 

occurrence of workplace accidents 

and injuries. The significant reduction 

in lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) 

at our Nigerian operations is due to the 

fact that we now have more estates 

in operation in the country, resulting 

in a higher number of working hours 

across the board. Despite this, we have 

managed to keep the occurrence of 

accidents relatively low. Our mill in 

Nigeria was replaced in 2018 and we 

are now able to better monitor and 

report accident figures.

In our sugar operations in Australia and 

New Zealand, we work to instil proper 

health and safety practices through 

our Sugar Environment, Health and 

Safety (EHS) policy. This policy is 

complemented by our dedicated 

EHS management system, which 

outlines social policies, standards 

and procedures. In Myanmar, our 

joint venture Great Wall-Wilmar 

Holdings has a Safety Committee that 

oversees the company’s production 

safety management and employee 

health and safety. This committee is 

responsible for ensuring that practices 

are in line with the relevant national 

safety laws and regulations, as well 

as with Wilmar’s standards and NDPE 

requirements. 

In Australia, our processes for planting, 

harvesting and chemical-application 

are mechanised, which significantly 

lowers our workers’ risk of injury or 

accident.

Fatalities

Every fatality is taken seriously and 

is followed up by an investigation 

into its cause. The outcome of this 

investigation forms the basis of an 

action plan to prevent recurrence. 

These action plans are reinforced 

through continual efforts in health 

and safety training and PPE use to 

minimise and/or eliminate the risk of 

fatal incidents in the future. 

We are deeply saddened to report six 

work-related employee fatalities in 

2018. Two fatalities occurred in our 

plantations in Central Kalimantan, one 

at our plantation in West Sumatra, one 

at our plantation in North Sumatra, 

one at our mill in Sumatra, and one 

at our plantation in Nigeria. Two of 

these fatalities were precipitated by 

critical health conditions: one was 

a result of hypertension, the other 

was caused by a heart attack. Three 

fatalities occurred in onsite accidents, 

one involving a vehicle accident during 

loading at a warehouse, one caused 

by injuries from a sickle, and one 

caused by a burn injury from a CPO 

splash. One worker died as a result of a  

truck accident on his return home 

from work.

In response to these incidents, we have 

conducted thorough investigations 

and have taken steps to ensure that 

the risks relating to these fatalities 

are mitigated in future. We have 

established and socialised health 

memoranda and counselling to 

ensure workers understand how to 

maintain healthy lifestyles. We have 

also revised employee recruitment 

procedures to ensure candidates who 

are indicated for hypertension in their 

medical examinations do not qualify 

for strenuous work.

Workers who are indicated to have 

high blood pressure, high cholesterol 

or high blood sugar levels will have 

their tasks and position reviewed 

alongside the company doctor’s 

recommendations. Provisions will 

also be made for better supervision 

of these individuals. 

To address the fatalities related to 

onsite accidents, we have strengthened 

safety checks and SOPs for the loading 

and unloading process. Specific 

measures include ensuring wheel 

chokes are provided for all operational 

trucks and heavy equipment, and 

the socialising of contractor safety 

management systems. We also have 

revised inspection checklists for 

sickle sheath worthiness, developed 

systematic arrangements for their 

mobilisation, and have conducted 

training on work safety. At the mill, a 

breather system and a strainer were 

installed at the digester to prevent 

further CPO blockage. A review of the 

appropriate modes of transportation 

has been undertaken and road tests 

have been carried out to ensure 

vehicles are roadworthy.

There were no fatalities reported 

within our sugar operations.

Smallholder Support

Smallholders account for 40% of 

the world’s palm oil production. We 

therefore place significant importance 

on providing them with guidance 

and support to produce oil palm 

sustainably while ensuring they are 

very much a part of our integrated 

global operations. Smallholder 

inclusivity is not only a prerequisite 

for our social license to operate, and 

for maintaining our good relations 

with local communities, but also 

ensures the commercial operability 

of our palm oil mills. While we strongly 

support certification as a component 

in incentivising smallholders to 

implement sustainable practices, it is 

equally important to make sure that 

these farmers understand the direct 

value of sustainability as an integral 

part of producing quality FFB.

Wilmar sources FFB from both 

scheme (or plasma) smallholders 

and independent smallholders. We 

are committed to helping our oil 

palm scheme smallholders achieve 

certification under applicable national 

certifications, and where relevant, 

the RSPO Smallholder Principles &amp; 

Criteria. A total of 3,690 hectares of 

smallholder area was certified in 2018, 

reflecting a reduction in certified area 

due to some certifications expiring at 

end-2018.

Meanwhile, we have also continued 

to grow our independent smallholder 

base. In 2018, we bought a total 

of 554,333 tonnes of FFB from 

independent smallholders, of which 

80% was from Indonesia, 13% from 

Malaysia, 6% from Ghana and the 

remainder from Nigeria.

in Myanmar – has a market share of

Smallholder Programmes

To support palm oil smallholders,

Council to assist all suppliers in 

achieving the MSPO certification 

before the end of 2019. Central to 

this initiative is our Supplier Reporting 

Tool (SRT), which we are rolling out 

to identify gaps and deploy resources 

more effectively. In 2018, the SRT was 

successfully implemented among 

our suppliers in Malaysia, Indonesia, 

Colombia, Honduras and Guatemala.

2025. This means that each smallholder 

linked to our supply chain will have 

access to a platform for expertise and 

best practice sharing to meet their 

sustainable production requirements 

and for economic growth. 

In Indonesia, our efforts in 2018 have 

continued to focus on grouping and 

partnering independent smallholders 

with our stand-alone mills to enable 

ISPO certification. This includes training 

on best management practices, as 

well as sustainability requirements. In 

2018, 6,087 independent smallholders 

participated in the ISPO certification 

training programme, and our target is 

to train 24,218 smallholders by 2025. 

We also have a voluntary fertiliser 

programme for our Indonesian 

independent smallholders.

In Ghana and Nigeria, our focus has 

been on improving the livelihoods 

of the smallholders in our scheme 

programmes (see following pages for 

more information).

For Malaysia we have introduced 

specific smallholder programmes for 

sustainable certification (covering both 

RSPO and MSPO) in collaboration 

with Wild Asia’s group smallholder 

programme, as well as a fertiliser access 

programme through a subsidised 

loan structure. In 2018, a total of 132 

training sessions on Wilmar’s NDPE 

policy and certification works were 

conducted for 3,171 independent 

and associated smallholders across 

Malaysia and Indonesia.

We conduct training programmes for 

our sugar outgrowers in Myanmar, 

expanding technical capacity and 

knowledge of best management 

practices. Training sessions reaching 

978 farmers were conducted at 19 

locations in 2018. These provided 

forums to share knowledge on good 

farming practices for land preparation, 

planting systems, cane nutrient 

requirements, fertiliser application,

Pilot Outgrower Scheme, Nigeria

The presence of Wilmar’s Biase Plantation Ltd (BPL) and Eyop Industries present a unique opportunity in rural Cross 

River State, Nigeria. Through our programmes, scores of farmers are beginning to revive their once-abandoned 

oil palm plantations whilst others are commencing a process to replant their old farms. 

 

In 2017, BPL launched a Pilot Outgrower Scheme with four cooperative groups from the surrounding areas of 

the plantation. This initially included conducting assessments to ensure there will be no deforestation or damage 

to HCV areas and surveying lands and ensuring locals obtain proper land ownership documentation from the 

local government. This was then followed by providing trainings to the cooperatives on four key areas: Group 

Dynamics and Group Management, Farm Management and Sustainable Production. During the planting season 

of 2018, BPL started working with the outgrowers to establish their plantations, following Wilmar’s planting 

procedures. High yielding and improved seedlings were made available to the cooperatives and BPL supervised 

the land preparation and planting.

The BPL Pilot Outgrower Programme currently covers a land area of 150 hectares and benefits a total of 43 

farmers from the four cooperative groups. Through the scheme, local farmers are beginning to take advantage of 

the improved planting stock, plantation management technologies and ready market opportunities that Wilmar 

offers. The company also provides low interest funding for the entire project.

Over 2,000 farmers have expressed interest in joining the second phase of this programme and we are currently 

engaging with the Central Bank of Nigeria and other potential funders on a scaling up. We expect all farmers to 

be in full compliance within a year of commencing the project.

Smallholder

Support

weed control, and the safe handling 

and application of chemicals. A total of 

12 demonstration plots were planted 

during the 2018 season. These plots 

enabled farmers to gain hands-on 

experience of working with sustainable 

methods. On top of training provided, 

site visits to farmers’ fields were 

also conducted to help analyse 

their problems with suggestions for 

resolution.

We are also working with our first-tier 

suppliers across Latin America to build 

capacity and provide training to their 

smallholder suppliers. Meanwhile, we 

continue to enhance smallholders’ 

capacity to implement good 

environmental and social practices 

in accordance NDPE policy through 

innovative local partnership platforms, 

such as Wilmar Small Growers Support 

Colombia (WISSCo) programme and 

the Wilmar Smallholders Support 

Honduras (WISSH) programme.

After three years of implementation, 

the WISSH programme has 

successfully completed its objective 

with 3,300 smallholders successfully 

trained on multiple sustainability 

topics over 448 training sessions. 

A completion event was organised 

to provide various stakeholders the 

opportunity to exchange experiences 

and challenges throughout the 

programme. The programme was 

well received with attendance from 

many smallholders, mill participants, 

programme sponsors, representatives 

of the Honduras banking industry and 

the regional government.

Smallholder Mapping

While we work to fulfil and enforce 

our NDPE commitments of No 

Deforestation and No Peat, we are 

simultaneously undertaking measures 

to ensure that our efforts do not 

negatively impact smallholders. We 

will continue working closely with any 

suspended supplier to help them bring 

their operations back into compliance 

and prevent inadvertent losses for 

smallholders. 

We will also support the mapping of 

independent oil palm smallholder 

plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia 

– many of which are linked to 

independent mills in our supply chain.

Providing Access to Sustainable Practices and Alternative Livelihoods in Africa

Adum Smallholder Scheme, Ghana

In 2016, three communities in Mpohor District of the Western Region of Ghana approached Wilmar’s subsidiary, 

Benso Oil Palm Plantations (BOPP) Limited, to seek assistance in sustainable and best agricultural practices for 

development of 1,400 hectares of their farmlands into a smallholder oil palm plantation.

The Adum Smallholder Scheme is a unique community initiative that was launched in 2018 and we expect the 

programme to benefit all 300 farmers by 2020 (160 in 2019 and 140 in 2020). From its onset, it was designed 

with three components aimed at protecting the environment, enhancing livelihoods and also promoting socio-

economic development. 

Detailed HCV and impact assessments have been conducted to ensure that the planned plantation development 

would not replace high conservation values or forests. Farmers are still awaiting the completion of the RSPO New 

Planting Procedure process and the commencement of plantation development. However, to avoid possible 

encroachment into forested areas and also to ensure that local farmers do not suffer unduly during the plantation 

development phase, BOPP in partnership with the local communities and Proforest secured some support from 

Partnership for Forests (P4F) to develop a forest protection mechanism and implement alternative/additional 

livelihood schemes.

Two important protected forest reserves exist within the landscape – the Subiri and Nueng Forest Reserves. The 

partners of the programmes are working with local government authorities and the communities to develop 

enforceable by-laws that would prevent encroachments and degradation of the protected areas in the landscape. 

At the same time, an alternative/additional livelihood scheme has been introduced to provide income generating 

ventures in the communities, which also prevents farmers and hunters from extending their activities into nearby 

forests in line with the agreed local government by-laws. The livelihood enhancing activities include baking, 

piggery, poultry farming, bee-keeping, livestock farming and gari processing. For each of these livelihood 

activities, detailed on-the-job technical trainings are provided to the beneficiaries followed by start-up capital. 

Further trainings on fund management and book keeping are provided as well. Additionally, the beneficiaries 

are linked to markets in the cities to ensure the economic sustainability of their businesses and good pricing for 

their products. 

This diversification of incomes is expected to make 

them more resilient to commodity price fluctuations 

and provide them with reliable income sources both 

during the immature phases of plantation development 

and also throughout the life of the project.

ilmar pledges to recognise 

and respect the long-term 

customary and individual rights of 

indigenous and local communities 

and recognising food security needs 

in new developments. We diligently 

strive to ensure that we only use 

land to which we have a legal right, 

and where we are recognised as the 

rightful managing entity by the local 

and national governments.

We also commit to ensuring legal 

compliance and that international best 

practices on Free, Prior and Informed 

Consent (FPIC) are implemented prior 

to commencing any new operations, 

which is a participatory process that 

empowers local communities to 

negotiate the conditions under which a 

project will be designed, implemented, 

monitored and evaluated. The principle 

of FPIC is recognised in the United 

Nations Declaration on the Rights of 

Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), which 

states that local communities have 

the right to give or withhold their 

consent to proposed projects that 

may affect the lands they customarily 

own, occupy or otherwise use. 

Land issues and conflict

Land use and land ownership are 

inherently complex matters in most 

of the countries where we operate, 

with overlapping or undelineated 

land rights in land concessions 

being a common challenge. Shaped 

by a nation’s development policies 

and projects, these can sometimes 

have an unintentional impact on 

local communities and result in 

disagreements and conflicts. This has 

resulted, for example, in delays in the 

issuing of HGU for some of our estates 

in Indonesia.

Our standard practice involves 

negotiating with individual landowners 

and local community leaders, or 

the government, depending on the 

country. We endeavour to be respectful 

of local communities whenever such 

disputes arise and are committed to 

building long-term relationships in a 

consensual manner as part of our goal 

of achieving harmonious relations with 

Community

Relations

all our stakeholders. We have engaged 

with many of these communities 

through participative mapping and 

strive to address concerns through 

mediation processes. In the event 

of loss or damage affecting legal or 

customary rights, property, resources 

or livelihoods, we endeavour to 

undertake all measures to remedy 

such loss or damage.

RSPO Complaint Cases

As of March 2019, there are two ongoing RSPO complaint cases against 

our subsidiaries. As a committed member of the RSPO, Wilmar has always 

followed the due process of the RSPO Complaints Panel and is always 

cooperative in any investigations.

In September 2018 we received news of a complaint lodged with RSPO in 

July 2018 against our subsidiary, PT. Primatama Mulia Jaya by the Luhak 

indigenous community. The complaint concerns the issuance of Right of 

Utilisation over the land without prior consultation with the community. 

This case is currently undergoing review by the Complaints Panel.

A second complaint was submitted to RSPO in October 2018 over 

concerns that our subsidiary, PT. AMP Plantation, has breached plasma 

scheme arrangements (based on a 1997 plasma agreement) by failing to 

perform necessary land certificate arrangements, and by not disclosing 

profit made from sales of FFB between 2002 and 2014. There is also 

an allegation concerning embezzled funds relating to land certification 

for 100 hectares. We take these allegations seriously and will work 

diligently through the RSPO Complaints Process to ensure these issues 

are addressed in an appropriate manner. 

Updates on previous cases

The case lodged in 2016 against our subsidiary PT. Bumi Sawit Kencana II 

concerns allegations that the company has not yet paid compensation for 

78 hectares of land owned by the villagers. After a review and deliberation 

by the RSPO Complaints Panel the case was dismissed in March 2019.

In September 2018, the RSPO complaint case concerning our subsidiary 

PT. Permata Hijau Pasaman (PHP I) was closed after a participatory 

mapping process and agreed implementation plan were finalised. In this 

case, the local community, Nagari Kapa, requested clarity on PT. PHP I’s 

nucleus estate and land use right application. A participatory mapping 

process was carried out through consultation with Nagari Kapa and local 

government bodies followed up with an implementation plan. The case 

is now with the RSPO Investigation &amp; Monitoring Unit.

We strive for a fair compensation 

to the local community leaders for 

existing crops, with statutory levels of 

compensation as a minimum. We also 

implement progressive community 

development programmes through 

employment opportunities and 

smallholder schemes, making every 

effort to ensure that communities 

are satisfied with the socioeconomic 

benefits that development will bring. 

In 2018, Wilmar commissioned TFT 

(now known as Earthworm Foundation) 

to undertake a thorough evaluation on 

issues and risks related to our West 

Sumatran operations stemming from 

historical land acquisition in the 1990s. 

The programme focuses on:

• 

The current policies, procedures 

and practices related to grievance 

management in and around each 

company subsidiary’s operational 

areas;

• 

Existing and past grievance cases 

raised by local communities;

• 

The original and historical land 

acquisition processes in the 

1990s (linked to many existing 

grievances); and

• 

The original setup of local 

partnership schemes between 

companies and local people linked 

to the management of plasma and 

the original land acquisition.

The programme will continue to early 

2019, and the results from this will be 

used to develop timebound action 

plans for resolution.

Supporting

Local Communities

M

any of our operations are located 

in remote parts of developing 

countries and are often close to 

local communities. Our business 

activities therefore have direct and 

indirect impacts on the livelihoods 

of our employees, their families and 

neighbouring communities. We seek 

to facilitate self-reliance, particularly 

through the provision of education, 

healthcare and infrastructure. This 

includes the provision of schools, 

maintaining workers’ housing, and 

establishing public facilities in and 

around our plantations, such as 

places of worship, sporting facilities, 

orphanages and nursing homes. It also 

includes organising programmes for 

community development and relief 

in areas struck by natural disasters.

Access to Education

We are firm believers in supporting 

efforts to empower community 

development through education. 

Wilmar invests substantially to provide 

workers’ children with access to 

education, in line with SDG 4 on 

Quality Education. Besides ensuring 

inclusive and equitable quality 

education, we are heavily invested 

in providing a range of services in 

our plantations, including childcare 

and daycare facilities, crèches, 

kindergartens and schools.

We have 15 schools in our Indonesian 

plantations, which together cover 

kindergarten, primary and secondary-

level curricula. We also support the 

education of more than 5,000 children 

in our local communities, including 

our employees’ children. In our 

estates in Malaysia we have a total 

of 17 primary schools that benefit a 

total of 747 children. In addition, we 

are working with the Sabah-based 

non-profit organisation Humana 

Child Aid Society to provide for the 

children of migrant workers in our 

operations in Malaysian Borneo. 

The educational syllabus is designed 

based on the Malaysian curriculum, 

but also integrates Indonesia-centric 

subjects to help ease the Indonesian 

children’s transition into mainstream 

societies whether they choose to stay 

in Malaysia or return to Indonesia. As 

well as providing free education, we 

also subsidise uniforms, books and 

food every year.

Through our joint venture, Great Wall-

Wilmar Holdings, we are providing 

donations for school redevelopment 

programmes in the vicinity of our 

mill in Myanmar. For our Myanmar 

sugar farms, about 93% of children 

of school going age attend schools 

operated by the government. There 

are also kindergartens in the factory 

compound, and 80 students are 

children of employees. 

School Redevelopment 

Programme

We are working closely with the 

Indonesian Education Ministry to 



Computer access and learning for students at one of our redeveloped schools in Indonesia

ensure that our privately run schools 

are in compliance with all government 

standards. Where there are already 

existing government schools close 

to our estates, we have also planned 

for their improvement.

Wilmar has ongoing school 

redevelopment programmes in 

Indonesia, Nigeria and Ghana to 

ensure that schools are upgraded 

with adequate facilities, including 

computer labs, science labs and 

libraries. We also aim to ensure that 

all settings are equipped for extra-

curricular activities, such as music, 

arts, sports and uniformed groups. The 

redevelopment programme annually 

benefits between 6,500 and 7,000 

children from pre-primary school age 

through to secondary school age. 

As of 2018, 10 schools have been 

redeveloped in Indonesia, while the 

five remaining schools are targeted 

for completion by 2020. Three schools 

have completed redevelopment in 

Nigeria while the remaining schools 

are targeted for completion by 

2020. Both schools in Ghana have 

undergone redevelopment.

In addition to upgrading and providing 

new facilities, outstanding students are 

offered scholarships to pursue further 

education at provincial and national 

universities. In Australia, we provide 

educational bursaries to students at 

local high schools near our operations. 

We also offer sponsorships and 

internship opportunities to schools and 

tertiary education institutions. And to 

inspire potential future employees, we 

provide site tours and milling process 

explanations to students from schools 

throughout our milling regions. 

Healthcare and Community 

Safety

At Wilmar, we consider health and 

wellbeing to be essential components 

of sustainable development. This is 

in line with SDG 3, which focuses on 

ensuring healthy lives and promoting 

wellbeing for all. In addition to 

providing healthcare for our workers 

and their families, the clinics in our oil 

palm plantations are also accessible 

to local communities for basic 

healthcare services. In 2018, we have 

invested in building new clinics as 

well as maintaining existing facilities 

in Indonesia and Nigeria. 

In Australia, we contribute to raising 

awareness on issues such as mental 

health, suicide prevention, cancer 

prevention and domestic violence. 

These engagements target workers 

and community member in and 

around our cane operations, as well as 

students from neighbouring schools. 

We continue to encourage our people 

to go out and make a difference in 

our communities. In 2018, employees 

from Sugar Australia in Yarraville 

volunteered their time to contribute 

to Foodbank Australia, where they 

packed an estimated 17,840 meals. 

This would be enough to feed a family 

of four people three meals a day for 

1,460 days.

In the local community hubs and 

schools close to our cane farms 

with mills where railroads are used 



Health check-up being conducted for our workers in a Wilmar clinic

for logistical purposes, Wilmar 

contributes to and participates 

in various community events 

to promote “cane train” safety 

programmes. We also provide 

financial support to various rescue 

organisations and initiatives, 

including Central Queensland 

Rescue, Burdekin Volunteer Marine 

Rescue, Whitsunday Volunteer 

Marine Rescue and Cardwell Coast 

Guard. Among other projects, our 

donations have contributed towards 

the construction of a fence for a 

new emergency helipad installed in 

a Burdekin fishing community.

On the business-to-consumer front, 

we recognise that sugar consumption 

is rising in many parts of the world, 

and that excessive sugar consumption 

can be harmful to health. We seek to 

ensure that we are fully transparent 

about the nutritional content of our 

sugar-packed products, and have 

ongoing projects to enhance sugar 

properties, such as testing for varieties 

with a low Glycaemic Index.

FY2018 Myanmar data is reported based on the calendar year (January to December 2018) due to unpredictable shifts in harvesting cycles and is 

not comparable to previous years’ data, where they were first collated based on an April to March harvesting cycle. Moving forward, all sugarcane 

production data will be reported as at end-December of the reporting period.

Since 2017, reporting is based on area burnt within concession boundaries and area burnt outside concession boundaries (within 5km radius).

8 

Burnings in Australia are usually prescribed. There was one accidental fire in 2017. 

9 

For 2018 PalmGHG calculations we have included breakdown by area into the calculator. Therefore, sequestration in conservation area figures are 

significantly higher than 2017 figures due to the HCV area breakdown for Central Kalimantan. 

10 

Conservation area offset data for 2016 was previously incorrectly calculated and reported. This figure has now been restated in this report.

In the course of compiling data for our 2015 Sustainability Report, we discovered that methodology for collating incidents differed across our sites, with 

some sites using national or regional thresholds for reporting, and others using international Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 

standards. Due to these inconsistencies, we have excluded LTIR reporting in our 2015 report. We resumed LTIR reporting in our 2016 Sustainability 

Report after setting a more consistent reporting standard across the Group.

24 

Robust systems for our accident reporting for our Nigeria mills were still being established prior to 2018. We will now include accident reporting 

moving forward.

GRI Content

Index

T

he Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a multi-stakeholder standard for sustainability reporting, providing guidance on 

determining report content and indicators. GRI is the first and most widely adopted global standard for sustainability 

reporting and has been designed to enhance the global comparability and quality of information on environmental and social 

impacts, thereby enabling greater transparency and accountability of organisations. Sustainability reporting based on the GRI 

Standards should provide a balanced and reasonable representation of an organisation’s positive and negative contributions 

towards the goal of sustainable development. We report in accordance with the latest version of the GRI Standards, which 

are 2016 for all disclosures except for disclosures 303 and 403, which were updated in 2018.

There are two options for preparing a report in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core and Comprehensive. This report 

has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option.

A hash symbol (#) in the Sustainability Report 

denotes statements and claims on which we 

have performed limited assurance procedures. 

Management’s and Board of 

Directors’ responsibility 

The Management is responsible for the preparation 

of the Subject Matters in accordance with the 

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability 

Reporting Standards. The Board has ultimate 

responsibility for the company’s sustainability 

reporting

The Management is responsible for the collection 

and presentation of the information and for 

maintaining adequate records and internal 

controls that are designed to support the 

sustainability reporting process. For the purpose 

of the Sustainability Report 2018, there are no 

legally prescribed requirements relating to the 

verification of sustainability reports.

Auditor’s Independence and 

Quality Control

We have complied with the independence and 

other ethical requirements of the Accounting 

and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) 

Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for 

Public Accountants and Accounting Entities 

(ACRA Code), which is founded on fundamental 

principles of integrity, objectivity, professional 

competence and due care, confidentiality and 

professional behaviour.

Our firm applies Singapore Standards on Quality 

Control 1 of the Institute of Singapore Chartered 

Accountants and, accordingly, maintains a 

comprehensive system of quality control 

including documented policies and procedures 

regarding compliance with ethical requirements, 

professional standards and applicable legal and 

regulatory requirements.

We have the required competencies and 

experience to conduct this assurance 

engagement. Our professionals have both 


Wilmar International Limited

Driving Transformation

116

the required assurance skills and experience 

in the applicable subject matters including 

environmental, social and financial aspects

Auditor’s responsibility 

Our responsibility is to form a conclusion on 

Wilmar’s preparation of the Subject Matters 

based on our work. We performed our work 

in accordance with International Standard on 

Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000) 

(Revised) – Assurance Engagements other 

than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 

Information (the “Standard”). This Standard 

requires that we plan and perform our work to 

form the conclusion. The extent of our work 

performed depends on our professional judgment 

and our assessment of the engagement risk.

Our review was limited to the information on the 

select indicators set out within the Report from 

01 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 and our 

responsibility does not include:

• 

Any work in respect of sustainability 

information published elsewhere in 

Wilmar’s annual report, website and other 

publications,

• 

Sustainability information prior to 01 January 

2018 and subsequent to 31 December 2018, 

and

• 

Management’s forward looking statements 

such as targets, plans and intentions.

Reporting criteria

As a basis for the assurance engagement, we have 

used the criterion of “Accuracy” as defined by GRI 

and specific criteria determined by Wilmar as 

being relevant for its sustainability performance. 

We consider these reporting criteria to be relevant 

and appropriate to review the Report.

Assurance standard used and 

level of assurance

Our limited assurance engagement has been 

planned and performed in accordance with 

the ISAE 30001 Assurance Engagement Other 

Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 

Information. 

A limited assurance engagement consists of 

making enquiries and applying analytical and 

other review procedures.  Our procedures were 

designed to provide a limited level of assurance 

and as such do not provide all the evidence that 

would be required to provide a reasonable level 

of assurance. 

The procedures performed depend on our 

judgement including the risk of material 

misstatement of the specific activity data, whether 

due to fraud or error. While we considered the 

effectiveness of Management’s internal controls 

when determining the nature and extent of our 

procedures, our review was not designed to 

provide assurance on internal controls. We 

believe that the evidence we have obtained is 

sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 

our conclusion.

What we did to form our 

conclusions

We designed our procedures in order to state 

whether anything has come to our attention to 

suggest that the Subject Matters detailed above 

has not been reported in accordance with the 

reporting criteria cited earlier. In order to form 

our conclusions, we undertook the steps below:

1. 

Inquiries with Wilmar’s Sustainability team 

to:

a. 

Understand principal business 

operations, 

b. 

Appreciate key sustainability issues 

and developments,

c. 

Map out information flow for 

sustainability reporting and the 

relevant controls,

d. 

Identify data providers with their 

responsibilities, and 

e. 

Recognise the likelihood of fraud on 

the sustainability information.

2. 

Undertake multiple visits to:

a. 

Wilmar’s headquarters in Singapore,

b. 

Wilmar’s selected palm oil plantations, 

mills and refineries in West Sumatera 

and South Sumatera, and

c. 

Wilmar’s selected sugar plantations, 

mills, and refineries in Australia

3. 

Interviews with and clarifications sought from 

employees and Management in Singapore, 

Indonesia, Malaysia, Ghana, Nigeria, 

Myanmar, Australia and New Zealand (e.g. 

Sustainability team, Human Resources, Estate 

Managers) to understand key sustainability 

issues related to the selected indicators, 

collection processes and accuracy of 

reporting. 

4. 

Conduct process walk-through of systems 

and processes for data aggregation and 

reporting, with relevant personnel to 

understand the quality of checks and 

control mechanisms, assessing and testing 

the controls in relation to the concerned 

subject matters.

5. 

Obtain documentation through sampling 

methods to verify assumptions, estimations 

and computations made by Management in 

relation to the concerned subject matters. 

6. 

Checking that data and statements had been 

correctly transcribed from corporate systems 

and/or supporting evidence, in relation to 

concerned subject matters.

Observations and areas for 

improvement

Our observations and areas for improvement 

will be raised in a separate report to Wilmar’s 

Board of Directors and Management. These 

observations and areas for improvement do not 

affect our conclusion on the aforementioned 

Subject Matters included in the Sustainability 

Report. 

Other matters

Our responsibility in performing our limited 

assurance activities is to the Management of 

Wilmar only and in accordance with the terms of 

reference agreed with them. We do not accept or 

assume any responsibility for any other purpose or 

to any other person or organisation. Any reliance 

any such third party may place on the Report is 

entirely at their own risk.

Conclusion

Based on the procedures performed and evidence 

obtained, nothing has come to our attention that 

causes us to believe that the information in the 

Report was not presented fairly, and calculated 

in all material respects in accordance with the 

reporting criteria detailed above.

values that may be considered for 

development.

Independent Director

According to the Listing Manual of 

SGX, an independent director is one 

who has no relationship with the 

company, its related corporations (i.e.

independent business judgement 

with a view to the best interests of 

the company.

Independent smallholder

Small growers with less than 50 

hectares, which are self-financed, 

managed, and equipped and are

Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil 

(ISPO) standard

Mandatory requirement for all oil 

palm growers and millers operating 

in Indonesia with the objective to 

holistically address environmental 

issues within the oil palm industry and 

thereby improve the competitiveness 

of Indonesian palm oil in the global 

market.

Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

IPM is the careful consideration of all 

available pest control techniques and 

subsequent integration of appropriate 

measures that discourage the 

development of pest populations and 

keep pesticides and other interventions 

to levels that are economically justified 

and reduce or minimise risks to human 

health and the environment. IPM 

emphasises the growth of a healthy 

crop with the least possible disruption 

to agro-ecosystems and encourages 

natural pest control mechanisms.

International Labour Organization 

(ILO)

Is a tripartite world body representative 

of labour, management and 

government, and is an agency of 

the United Nations. It disseminates 

labour information and sets minimum 

international labour standards called 

“conventions”, offered to member 

nations for adoption.

International Sustainability and 

Carbon Certificate (ISCC)

ISCC is a sustainability certification 

system covering the entire supply 

chain and all kinds of bio-based 

feedstocks and renewables.

Land application

In the context of Wilmar’s palm oil 

operations, land application refers to 

wastewater from FFB processing at 

Wilmar’s mills (POME) applied to land 

as a fertiliser.

Mass Balance

The Mass Balance system allows for 

mixing of RSPO-certified and non-

certified palm oil at any stage in the 

supply chain provided that overall 

company quantities are controlled. The 

mass balance model is constructed in 

such a way that volumes of RSPO-

certified product shipped will never 

exceed volumes received by the end-

user.

Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil 

(MSPO)

The MSPO Certification Scheme is 

the national scheme in Malaysia for 

oil palm plantations, independent and 

organised smallholdings, and palm 

oil processing facilities to be certified 

against the requirements of the MSPO 

Standards.

New Planting Procedure (NPP)

RSPO’s NPP consists of a set of 

assessments and verification activities 

to be conducted by RSPO grower 

members and certification bodies 

prior to a new oil palm development, 

in order to help guide responsible 

planting and ensure that social and 

environmental requirements have 

been met.

Non-executive director

than 65% organic matter is considered 

peatland.

Plasma schemes

A programme initiated by the 

Indonesian government to encourage 

the development of smallholders’ 

plantations with the assistance and 

cooperation of plantation companies 

(the nucleus) which assist and 

support the surrounding community 

plantations (the plasma).
