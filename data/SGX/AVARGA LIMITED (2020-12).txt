Message from the Board 

 

Dear Stakeholders, 

 

2020 marks the fourth year of Avarga Limited (“Avarga” and together with its subsidiaries, 

the “Group”) sustainability journey and we hereby present our fourth Sustainability Report 

(“SR”), covering the Financial Year ended 31 December 2020 (“FY2020”). This report outlines 

our growth and effort in managing the Group’s Environment, Social and Governance (“ESG”) 

performance.  

We recognise the importance of sustainability and believe that it is vital to our continuous 

growth and success. We must be fully accountable for our impact on the environment and 

our stakeholders and thus we ensure that sustainable practices are incorporated into our 

business operations. 

We review the material ESG factors annually such that we identify significant issues or 

concerns that our stakeholders might have. Our sustainability efforts are led by our senior 

management and monitored by our Board of Directors (the “Board”).  

2020 had been a challenging year for many due to the pandemic, COVID-19. The Group has 

business operations that span across Malaysia, Myanmar, Canada and the USA. Our three 

core businesses are paper manufacturing, power generation and building materials 

distribution. We prioritise the health and safety of our employees by encouraging them to 

continue working from home, where possible. 

For our paper manufacturing business in Malaysia, there were disruptions to the supply chain 

during the Movement Control Order (“MCO”) period. Cost of raw materials also increased 

due to the high demand from international and local markets.  

For our power generation business in Myanmar, due to the nature of the business, we are 

glad that the impact of COVID-19 is not strong on our business operations. Meanwhile, we 

will continue to closely monitor the evolving political developments in Myanmar. At the time 

of reporting, operations at our power plant have continued as normal and have not been 

affected by these political developments. 

For our building materials business in Canada, the government authorities have implemented 

emergency measures to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. This had impacted Taiga’s 

operations where sales decline over 30% for the month of April 2020. However, Taiga’s 

revenue recovered from this subsequently when the demand in housing and building 

materials increased as the citizens shifted to working from home.

Message from the Board (Cont’d) 

The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business activities remains uncertain. It is 

highly dependent on the geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, 

travel restrictions, subsequent outbreaks, business disruptions, and the effectiveness of 

actions taken to contain and treat the disease.  

The Group remains positive and will continue to focus on improving operational efficiency for 

our portfolio of businesses and evaluate opportunities for growth. We are confident that we 

have the capability to recover from this adversity and we will grow from the challenges 

COVID-19 brought about. 

Lastly, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude and appreciation towards our 

stakeholders who have participated and worked hard in our sustainability journey.  We look 

forward to your continuous support and partnership in our journey towards building a 

sustainable future.

Organisation Profile 

Avarga Limited is an established investment holding company listed on the Main Board of 

Singapore Exchange Limited. We specialise in the optimisation of return of equities through 

building sustainable value to our shareholders. We build business models that are long-term, 

focusing on competitive advantages, good management and innovation.  

 

Headquartered in Singapore, we have three core businesses in paper manufacturing, power 

generation and building materials distribution. We operate in five countries and employ more 

than 700 people with a total revenue of approximately $1.7 billion in FY 2020. These 

businesses generate sustainable cash flows, progressively diverting into other investments. 

Our three main businesses are as follow: 

 

 

 



Paper Manufacturing (Malaysia)

UPP Pulp &amp; Paper (M) Sdn Bhd is an upstream paper mill. We produce industrial 

grade papers such as testliner, corrugating medium and coreboard, which are 

used in the manufacture of corrugated carton boxes. Located in Ijok, Selangor, 

our paper mill is capable of producting up to 90,000 tonnes of paper per year.  

Our paper mill was awarded the ISO 90012015 Certification by ISOQAR Ltd in 

2015.





Power Generation (Myanmar)

UPP Power (Myanmar) Limited is one of Myanmar’s first fully foreign-owned 

independent power producers and accounts for almost 2% of the country's 

local total power generation. Located in Insein township, Yangon, our 50MW 

gas-fired power plant is contracted to sell a minimum of 350 million kilowatt 

hours (kWh) per year for a duration of 30 years, until Feb 2044, to the 

Myanmar Government. 





Building Materials Distribution (Taiga, Canada) 

Taiga Building Products Ltd ("Taiga") is Canada’s largest wholesale distributor of 

building materials, such as lumber, panels, moulding, sidings, engineering wood 

flooring and many others. Taiga has wood preservation plants and distribution 

centres across Canada, as well as distribution centres and reload stations in the 

USA. In 2018, Taiga acquired Exterior Wood Inc, based in Washington, USA, 

which enabled it to further extend its reach into the USA. Taiga also undertakes 

exports.

Supply Chain Management 

Our suppliers are extensively sourced and stringently evaluated to ensure that they meet the 

relevant specific guidelines that are in place. We are fully committed to deliver products and 

services that are of the highest quality to our customers. The Group follows strict procedures 

in identifying, selecting and monitoring suppliers. We aim to source only from ethical, 

responsible and cost-effective suppliers and minimise the potential disruptions, such as the 

provisions of raw materials in the supply chain. 

Machinery parts and scrap materials used for our paper mill in Malaysia are sourced 

extensively to ensure they help to boost efficiency in brown paper production. We also 

evaluate and monitor our raw material suppliers, to ensure they provide us quality scrap 

paper with lower levels of impurities.  Due to COVID-19, our supply chain management for 

our paper mill was slightly disrupted as the supply of waste paper was curtailed by the closure 

of factories and retail stores, as well as some of our suppliers.  

New and more highly energy efficient generators are used in our power plant in Myanmar, to 

ensure efficient gas utilisation and that energy generated does not go to waste.  

Taiga, our building materials distribution business in Canada and USA, has an extensive 

network of suppliers, given the wide range of products we carry and the scale of our 

operations. Taiga is relatively resilient in growth and revenue due to our strategic 

management planning, which includes growing market share, addition of more products into 

our distribution channel, more proactive trading and expansion of exports.  

Looking ahead, we will continue to strengthen our network of suppliers and procurement 

processes. We will continue source for new and more suitable suppliers in line with our 

sustainability efforts. We will continue to build strong and lasting relationships with our key 

suppliers, and evaluate ways to better manage our suppliers, supply chain, logistics and 

resources.

External Initiatives 

We have been consistently and actively taking part in Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) 

activities over the years. This is because the Group believes in contributing towards driving 

positive and sustainable changes for the benefit of the local communities where we operate, 

and society as a whole.  

Our CSR efforts are mainly focused in Myanmar, where we see room for improvement in living 

and education standards. Some of the CSR activities that we had took part in over the past 

few years are stated below. 

In Myanmar, we have identified a government primary school near our power plant in Yangon, 

No. 16 Basic Education Primary School, Ywama, Insein township, where we have been 

continuously helping to improve the school’s condition and providing a more conducive 

learning environment for the students.  

❖ 2015: Replaced two-thirds of the school’s old furniture with new desks and chairs. 

❖ 2016: Construct a new 900 sq. ft. air-conditioned multi-media hall, and equipped it 

with 31 sets of new computers, accessories, desks and chairs. 

❖ 2018: Built a school hall and meal area for the students. Donated a set of uniform, 

books and a school bag to each of the 830 students of the school. 

❖ 2019: Constructed a new 605 ft. length concrete school perimeter wall, contributed 

towards the establishment and furnishing of the school library and donated a set of 

school uniforms and books for each of the school’s 887 students. 

Another government school that we identified was No. 149 Basic Education Primary School in 

Kanuatgyi Village, Kanma Township, Magway Region.  

❖ 2018: We constructed a new 2,700 sq ft school building and donated a set of uniform, 

books and a school bag to each of the school’s 203 students. 

We have also made CSR contributions in Malaysia and Singapore.  

❖ We have pledged to donate a total of S$250,000 to the Singapore National Gallery to 

support and promote Singapore’s arts and cultural heritage. This comprises a donation 

of S$50,000 per year, over five years from 2018 to 2022.  

❖ In Malaysia, we donated RM30,000 in 2019 to Persatuan Kebajikan Amal Da Ai 

Malaysia, a non-profit charitable childcare centre looking after mentally and physically 

handicapped children on a full-time, lived in basis. 

In 2020, despite the challenges the Group faced in this COVID-19 period, we have not 

forgotten to play our part in CSR activities. We shifted our efforts to focus on combating the 

spread of virus, supporting our dedicated frontline healthcare workers and helping the 

affected communities in areas where we operate in.

External Initiatives (cont’d) 

❖ In Myanmar, we repaired an overhead water tank that was supplying water to the 

housing area near our power plant. We contributed 48 million kyat (or US$37,200) to 

repair the tank with capacity of over 50,000 gallons and weighing over 200 tonnes. 

❖ In Malaysia, we donated to The Edge COVID-19 Equipment Fund. These funds are used 

to purchase medical equipment such as protective suits, mask and ventilators, and 

also to provide financial assistance to healthcare workers who are infected while 

taking care of COVID-19 patients.  

❖ In Canada, Taiga Building Products created the Taiga Community Fund to support 

customers and organisations in need through difficult times, recipients of the 

donations from the fund include Abbotsford Food Bank, Kelowna’s Women’s Shelter 

and Coast Mental Health in British Columbia, the Arthouse for Children and Youth and 

Children’s Aid Foundation of Halton in Ontario; and the Big Brothers Big Sisters 

Foundations in both Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. 

 

Corporate Governance and Sustainability Approach 

We are committed to acting lawfully and with integrity in every aspect of our business. We 

have zero tolerance towards corruption and malpractice in the Group. Avarga has adopted a 

framework of corporate governance policies and practices in line with the principles and 

guidelines set out in the Code of Corporate Governance 2018.  

We continuously finetune our Code of Conduct Policy and Whistleblowing Policy to maintain 

sound corporate governance to enhance and safeguard the interest of our stakeholders. To 

effectively implement our sustainability approach and demonstrate accountability to our 

stakeholders, employees of Avarga follow strictly to the Code of Conduct Policy and the 

Whistleblowing Policy. 

We educate our employees through the Code of Conduct Policy to shape an organisational 

culture of honesty and integrity which integrate trust in our networking relationships. The 

Code of Conduct Policy sets out the principles and standards of behaviour to guide employees 

in carrying out their duties and responsibilities. It also reminds employees to comply with 

reporting and disclosure requirements of potential or actual conflicts of interest.  

The Group has established procedures to ensure that all transactions with interested persons 

are reported in a timely manner to the Audit and Risk Management Committee and that such 

transactions are reviewed and approved by senior executives, the Audit and Risk 

Management Committee and/or the Board, as the case may be, based on the transaction 

amount and whether they had been conducted on an arm’s length basis in accordance with 

prescribed procedures. When a potential conflict of interest arises, the Director concerned 

will not participate in discussions and will abstain from voting on such transaction.

Corporate Governance and Sustainability Approach (cont’d) 

The Group continues to educate our employees on our Whistleblowing Policy where 

employees understand the importance of highlighting any inappropriate behavior to maintain 

integrity and honesty for our stakeholders. Employees and external parties could raise 

concerns on possible corruption with regard to accounting, financial reporting, internal 

controls, auditing, or other matters, and be offered reassurance that they will be protected 

from reprisals or victimisation for whistle blowing in good faith.

Occupational health and safety (“OHS”) 

is a common concern but an important

protection and well-being as our duty. 

We recognise that our employees are 

our most important assets and they are 

vital to our businesses function and thus 

we believe that creating a safe and 

conducive working environment is 

essential for our employees. We want 

our employees to know that workplace

Economic Performance (Cont’d) 

The strong performance in FY2020 was mainly attributed to Taiga Building Products Ltd. The 

COVID-19 pandemic brought about opportunities to Taiga as citizens in Canada and United 

States shifted to work from home, resulting in strong housing markets and a surge in 

commodity prices such as lumber. As a result, out of the three main business segments, the 

gross profit generated from Taiga increased from 89% in FY2019 to 93% of the Group’s total 

in FY2020. 

On the other hand, our paper mill business was affected by the COVID-19. Non-essential 

businesses were ordered to close during the MCO in Malaysia. Our paper mill was allowed to 

operate during the MCO, on a reduced scale with restrictions and this resulted in lower 

production output. There was a shortage and increased costs of raw materials due to supply 

chain disruptions and increasing demands for raw materials.  

Financial performance for our power plant business remained consistent as the production of 

electricity was not affected by the COVID-19, given the need for electricity supply in Myanmar, 

where electrification rates are low. Our earnings for the power plant are also largely backed 

by the 30-year power purchase agreement, expiring in February 2044, with the Electric Power 

Generation Enterprise, under Myanmar's Ministry of Electricity and Energy.  

As an investment holding company, we also look for investment opportunities where we can 

add and create value. We have invested heavily in our entities in Malaysia, Myanmar, Canada 

and USA. We make continuous investments to increase efficiency, product quality, customer 

experiences and market reach. This is to ensure we firmly plant ourselves as significant players 

in our respective businesses.  

Taiga acquired US-based Exterior Wood Inc for US$42 million in 2018, which has significantly 

expanded our market presence in the USA. Exterior Wood has a wood treatment plant and 

distribution centre in Washougal, Washington. With the acquisition of Exterior Wood, Taiga 

now has a larger presence in the United States and a more diversified exposure to the North 

American housing market. 

For our paper manufacturing business, we are looking to take advantage of the increase in 

demand for e-commerce packaging during this period and also in the future as we see a 

growing shift towards e-commerce. We will also make continuous investments in machinery 

parts to upgrade our paper manufacturing plant in Malaysia.  

Our power plant in Myanmar underwent scheduled major overhaul throughout 2019-2020, 

with overhaul of the last of the 13 machines completed in July 2020, which improved the 

plant’s efficiency.  

Going forward, we will continue to focus on improving our three core businesses, as well as 

seek new opportunities on businesses with good potential and long-term sustainability. We 

aim to generate sustainable earnings and create value for our shareholders and stakeholders.

Anti-Corruption 

The Group strives to foster an environment where integrity, ethical practices are the basic 

values that we embed in our daily operations. To protect the interests of our stakeholders 

and minimise risk of reputational damage to the Group, we aim to maintain the highest 

standards in our business operations, and we have zero tolerance to bribery, unethical and 

corrupt practices. We refrain from all forms of bribery and money-laundering activities, and 

we abide by the rules of fair competition.  

We recognise that a high standard of corporate governance and business conduct, is integral 

in ensuring the sustainability of our business and performance, as well as safeguarding the

Employment 

The Group believes that our employees are our most valued assets and we recognised that 

attracting, retaining and developing talents is the key to the organisation’s success. We also 

believe that a diversified and merit-based workforce with the right skills and mindsets uplifts 

the quality of works, creates a positive working culture and environment, and increases 

productivity. Thus, we value employment welfare such as fair employment practices, 

competitive benefits and reward system.  

Our Human Resource management policies are established based on fair employment 

practices as part of our efforts to attract, develop and retain a motivated workforce. Also, 

through the whistleblowing policy, we ensure that our employees work in a fair and just 

environment.  

The Group recruits talents using merit-based system rather than class privilege and wealth. 

We provide them fair opportunities to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and experience. 

We promote a healthy mix of age, race and gender in the workplace, where possible.  

To retain such talents, we treat them fairly with due respect and provide them with employee 

benefits. Competitive benefits such as insurance coverage, maternity and paternity are 

provided to our full-time employees. These benefits are in accordance with the 

recommendations given by the Ministry of Manpower and are in line with market practices.  

We also foster a strong culture of collaboration and communication within the Group, to 

create a healthy organisational culture that promotes transparency, teamwork and team 

spirit. We communicate with our employees regularly through departmental meetings to 

gather feedback from them for the continuous improvement of our organisation. Through 

open and effective communications with our employees, we establish a common 

understanding and promote an inclusive work environment based on mutual trust and 

respect. 

Ensuring our employees’ health and well-being is also our priority. We are committed to 

achieve this by providing them with a secure and conductive working environment. We 

regularly monitor our performance in these areas so that we provide the best for them. We 

occasionally organise company events so that our employees can enjoy bonding time 

together. This helps to cultivate stronger teamwork and raise employees’ mental well-being.  

For our FY2020 Sustainability Report, we will be focusing on the employment statistics for 

UPP Pulp &amp; Paper (M) Sdn Bhd and Taiga Building Products Ltd. The workforce of our power 

plant operations in Myanmar is largely outsourced through a long-term Operations &amp; 

Maintenance contract with Myan Shwe Pyi Tractors Ltd, the official dealer for Caterpillar in 

Myanmar.

Occupational Health and Safety 

Our people are our greatest assets and their health and safety are of utmost importance to 

us. Their health and well-being ultimately affect the Group’s goals and objectives. We 

recognise that many of our employees work in environments that possess work hazards and 

we are committed to protect their safety and well-being. Creating a safe and conducive 

working environment is essential for our employees and we hope to uphold stringent and 

rigorous Occupational Health and Safety (“OHS”) standards. 

Safety starts with our established set of OHS-related policies for our business divisions, to 

create a safe environment for employees.  Our approach is to ensure full adherence to the 

legislative requirement and adoption of recommended industry standards and guidelines. 

Educating our employees on the importance of OHS and ensuring that they are aware of the 

guidelines in the OHS policy is also the key in minimising the number of accidents.  

In the Group, employees enjoy insurance and medical benefits paid for by the Group. Our 

policies and benefits are reviewed periodically to ensure they are adequate and fair. The 

Group also ensures compliance with all applicable local and national laws relating to health 

and safety.    

Manufacturing companies could have higher risk of workplace accidents as compared to 

other industries. Therefore, it is essential to implement additional measures tailored to the 

specific conditions of the production line. For the paper mill, there are policies on fire 

protection, hygiene and sanitation in handling equipment to ensure that there will be no cross 

contamination in the paper mill or paper processing plants.  

Safety awareness begins with understanding the work procedures and the workplace hazards. 

Employees must understand the safety rules and mandatory Personal Protective Equipment 

to be worn by the employees at all times when handling heavy equipment, operating 

machinery or chemicals. All workers must attend compulsory, regular safety and health 

trainings. Safety alarms are tested, and fire drill exercises are conducted as part of emergency 

preparedness procedure to ensure our employee are aware of the safety evacuation 

procedure. 

We have established standards for reporting on accidents and injuries suffered by our 

employees. All incidents must be reported to the manager or supervisor immediately without 

delay. Appropriate action will be taken by the manager or supervisor based on the severity of 

the incident. It is compulsory for all incidents to be documented, reported and submitted to 

management. Accidents reporting can also highlight learning point and provide insight on 

how similar accidents can be averted in the future.

In FY2020, we are proud to share that there was a significant decrease in the number of

Taiga Building Products Ltd. 

At Taiga, a policy on Health, Safety and the Environment is incorporated into our Employee 

Manual. The policy sets out safety measures and risk management guidelines for workplace 

safety and health hazards. This ensures that our businesses provide a safe workplace that is 

free from recognised hazards, promoting health and safety in the workplace, and bringing 

about a reduction in the occurrence of on the job injuries, illnesses, and fatalities. The policy 

also states the roles and responsibilities of the employees and the management. 

Education and prevention is the core of our policy to minimise the number of accidents. We 

closely monitor high risk activities, share near miss accidents that could lead to an accident. 

Employee orientation and training such as employee Safety Procedures training, Confined 

Spaces training, Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System training, Lock-Out 

training, and Personal Protective Equipment training are provided for employees who are 

newly hired or assigned to a new task. We ensure the employees understand the risks and 

safe operating procedures and practices before they start work. 

Taiga had established a health and safety committee team who is responsible for accident 

investigation, legislative awareness and workplace inspection, recommendations for 

improvements to health &amp; safety. Frequent reminders are given to employees on workplace 

safety. Safety measures and occupational health precautions are constantly conveyed to 

employees during regular meetings.

Taiga Building Products Ltd. (cont’d) 

In view of COVID-19, we had taken precautionary measures and implemented operational 

protocols in our operations in response to the growing concerns over the COVID-19 outbreak. 

For instance, we limit the number of staff at each location starting in March 2020.  

Temperature checks were made mandatory and minimizing of customer or supplier visits to 

sites were also introduced.  Beside COVID-19 precautionary measures, we had also provided 

our employees of the benefit to take the flu shot which the costs were borne by the company. 

In addition, we had applied for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy where we gain support 

from the government to cover part of our employees’ wages, to hire workers and prevent job 

losses. 

In FY2020, we have begun to track the data on Loss Day Rate to better monitor the injuries 

suffered by our workers and how we can improve on their safety wellbeing. The table below

Training and Education 

We believe that career development and employee training is crucial as it enhances 

productivity of all employees by equipping them with the necessary skillset to perform their 

duties in an ever-changing work environment. It is in our best interest to invest in the careers 

and skills of our employees through continuous learning and skills upgrading as increased 

performance of the employees brings a greater positive impact to the company.  

New employees attend orientation programmes to familiarise themselves with their job 

position and embrace the company culture. On-job trainings are also provided to existing 

employees to ensure that they are kept relevant of any updates and advances in their specific 

job positions. Employees’ supervisors share their experiences and knowledge, provide 

guidance and advices, as well as monitor the performance of the employees.  

We are committed to developing our employees’ skills and knowledge and we do that through 

performing annual appraisals for all of them. This ensures that we are able to recognise and 

reward them on their ability and contributions. This also allows their supervisors and 

managers to highlight to the employees the areas where they can improve on, and to 

commend on the areas they have done well.  

We also further develop their skills through trainings, promotions and workshops. Equal 

opportunities are given to all employees for their growth through the development 

programmes. We have set aside a fund for our employees to attend courses and seminars to 

develop and improve their skills so that they can achieve their fullest potential. We have been 

consistently providing all employees with both internal and external training for them to 

perform their job duties efficiently whenever necessary.

In Taiga, new employees are engaged with orientation programmes where they learn about 

the Group’s key policies. These programmes help them to familiarise themselves with the 

general working environment, corporate culture, service knowledge as well as quality 

requirements.  

Existing employees go through external and internal trainings to develop work-related skills 

and career advancement. Regular performance feedbacks were also conducted for the 

employees by their supervisor such that their learning needs were frequently assessed. Their 

supervisors also provide guidance and advices to them, as well as monitor their performance. 

Going forward, we aim to continuously improve the quality of our training courses to provide 

our employees with the necessary competence to perform their duties effectively. We will 

ensure that training programmes are available and accessible for our employees.

Environmental Compliance 

We believe in building a greener future and creating a friendlier environment for our 

stakeholders. The Group is committed to manage and minimise the impact of our business 

operations on the environment by actively minimising waste produced during our operations. 

We are conscious of the need to fully comply with all environmental rules and regulations by 

the relevant authorities.  

Our suppliers also play a role in helping us achieve our sustainability efforts. We involve them 

in sustainable practices through outlining our expectations in the vendor selection process as 

well as the evaluation of their performance. In addition, we constantly look for ways to 

improve our business processes and operations so as to reduce the negative impact on the 

environment.  

The paper mill operations are subjected to strict local council 

and federal environmental laws, particularly in relation to 

the discharge of waste and sludge. Where possible, we 

procure scrap paper with lower levels of impurities from 

our pool of vendors, to reduce the amount of excess 

unusable waste destined for disposal. Wastage and 

impurities are closely monitored to determine the quality of 

supplies and our vendors.  

Taiga is committed to operating its facilities in an environmentally responsible manner. 

Taiga's business activities are subjected to federal, state, provincial and local environmental 

laws and regulations, including requirements relating to air emissions, storage and handling 

of chemicals and hazardous substances, wastewater and storm water discharge, ownership 

and operation of underground storage tanks and cleanup of contaminated soil and 

groundwater.  

All three of Taiga's "Envirofor Preservers" treating plants have achieved the highest standard 

in Canada by being certified by Wood Preservation Canada. "Taiga Exterior Wood" preserved 

wood products are now covered by the Canadian Wood Pallet and Container Association. 

Taiga’s wood treating operations in the USA, under Exterior Wood Inc, have also complied 

with regulatory requirements related to environment.  

In FY2020, there were no significant fines or non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with 

environmental laws and regulations.

 Socioeconomic Compliance 

Our reputation is what it is today as we strive to comply with relevant socioeconomic laws 

and regulations by having various procedures and standards in place. Any material breach to 

the law or regulations could create a significant impact and result in irreversible reputational 

damage to us. Therefore, we ensure full compliance with laws and regulations by the local 

authorities in every area we operates in. 

We identify key laws and regulations set by the government and assign personnel in-charge 

to monitor compliance and adherence with the laws and regulations. We constantly keep 

ourselves updated with changes in the evolving regulatory landscape.   We regularly review 

our business activities to prevent potential infringement of laws and regulations.  

We have zero tolerance for any financial crime including corruption and bribery. Therefore, 

we ensure that our policies and code of conduct are implemented and communicated to all 

our employees, business partners and our Board members consistently. This is such that all 

our employees are aware of the consequences of non-compliance and fully adhere to the 

Group’s values by acting with integrity and conducting business in accordance with high 

ethical standards.  

We are committed to make regular periodic reports and updates to the relevant local and 

foreign government authorities in the regions that the Group operates in.
