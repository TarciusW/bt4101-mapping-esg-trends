Materiality

Guided by our SNRSCP commitments, we undertook a broad-ranging materiality assessment in 2019 which built on assessments 

conducted in previous years. In determining materiality, we took into account: where the issues matter across our supply chain, 

relevance to our key stakeholders and the risks and opportunities posed to our business.

Following guidance provided by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and analysis of the areas most important to our stakeholders, 

we streamlined our material issues into nine key areas. This has since been approved by our Board. 

Our materiality matrix illustrates the relative importance of material issues across our stakeholders and business. We will continue 

to engage with our stakeholders and refresh our analysis where appropriate.

Importance to Halcyon’s business success 

(higher score = higher importance)

The table in the next page provides further detail on how we define our material issues, where these issues are relevant across 

our supply chain, and the corresponding stakeholders, activities and GRI disclosures. The table also maps our material issues and 

activities against the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) following the Business Reporting on the SDGs 

developed by GRI and UN Global Compact.

Corporate Governance

We are committed to upholding the highest standards of corporate governance to create long-term shareholder value. Under the 

Board’s leadership, six key capitals: financial, manufacturing, intellectual, human, social and natural capital are allocated efficiently 

and productively in the best interests of our shareholders and other stakeholders. We adhere to all material principles and guidelines 

of the Code of Corporate Governance 2012, and all other applicable laws, rules and regulations. We engage proactively with 

regulators, governments, industry leaders and industry associations to understand local legal requirements across the jurisdictions 

where we operate. 

Corporate Governance Structure

The Board embraces the principle of empowerment. While the 

Board delegates certain functions to the Chief Executive Officer 

(CEO), Board Committees and Management, the responsibility of 

overseeing the company’s sustainability vision and performance 

in compliance with the GRI Guidelines and SGX Sustainability 

Reporting Guide, ultimately remains with the Board.

The CEO leads the management of material issues that are 

indivisible from the day-to-day operations while Management 

maintains a structured risk management approach that 

incorporates a continuous process of identification, evaluation 

and effective management of the risk factors. Supporting the 

CEO, the Chief Corporate Officer leads sustainability disclosure 

and engagement with our stakeholders with guidance from 

an Independent Director highly experienced in sustainability 

matters. The Board also appoints professional firms to identify 

impacts, risks, and opportunities, as well as to conduct 

comprehensive studies on issues or concerns relating to the 

material risks when needed.

oversees these principles, recorded in our standardised Global 

Employee Policy made readily available to all employees. 

We encourage our partners and suppliers to adhere to these 

principles by undertaking declarations of commitment to 

integrate these principles into their operations. Furthermore, 

we hold regular engagement sessions with them to understand 

the issues they might face in integrating these principles in 

their operations and provide assistance where required. Where 

needed, we visit our supplier sites to ascertain demonstrable 

integration of the principles in their operations.

FUNDAMENTALS

Ethics and Compliance

The Group has put in place a number of policies and standards, and systems for raising risk concerns as part of a strong ethics 

and compliance function. Our employees are expected to comply with the Group’s policies and uphold strict standards of ethical 

business conduct. Key policies including but not limited to anti-corruption &amp; anti-bribery, human rights &amp; ethical business practice, 

anti-harassment and environment, health &amp; safety are embedded into a Global Employees Policies handbook which has been 

communicated to each employee through our mandatory induction programmes. 

To supplement the implementation of the Group’s policies, open door and whistleblowing policies are also in place to allow employees 

and/or third parties to share their questions, concerns, suggestions or complaints and to ensure that their area of concern is addressed 

in the most appropriate manner. All instances of whistleblowing, including those that do not warrant investigation or any further action, 

will be reported to the Audit Committee. Grievances can be also directed to a dedicated email that goes to the Audit Committee.

As in recent years, we maintained an unblemished record of zero confirmed cases of corruption in 2019. An anonymous note 

concerning a subsidiary company was brought to the Company’s attention in 2019. Investigation has since been concluded and 

there is no credible evidence that any misconduct has occurred. We also did not record any material breaches of relevant laws 

and regulations in our respective jurisdictions except for effluent quality issues experienced by our Cameroonian and Ivory Coast 

operations.

Sustainable Natural Rubber Supply Chain Policy (SNRSCP)

As the world’s largest supplier of natural rubber and the owner of large plantation concessions, Halcyon understands its role and 

obligation to minimise impact on the environment while continuing to meet the growing demand for a critical natural resource. In 

response, the Group updated its Sustainable Natural Rubber Supply Chain Policy (SNRSCP) in February 2020 to reflect our commitment 

to NO DEFORESTATION in all Halcyon operations. We are the first rubber producer to publicly announce this commitment, further 

demonstrating our leadership in driving towards sustainable natural rubber. 

Sustainable Sourcing Policy

In 2019, we developed a Sustainable Sourcing Policy to articulate our requirements to suppliers. The policy mirrors our commitments 

to the SNRSCP. Being close to raw material sources, we recognise the complexities and challenges faced by our suppliers in 

implementing our sourcing policy. Our teams across Europe, the Americas and Asia have worked together throughout the year in 

developing a holistic rollout plan for suppliers. We will communicate this policy to our key suppliers in 2020.

The following sections report on our performance against these commitments. Halcyon remains determined to meet the highest 

sustainability standards for the industry and to provide customers with a premium critical product.

Sustainability Policy Transparency Toolkit (SPOTT)

SPOTT is an initiative of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL). In 2019, SPOTT expanded its scope to include natural rubber by 

launching its inaugural ESG policy transparency assessment. SPOTT assessed multiple natural rubber producers and processors 

based on publicly disclosed policies, operations and commitments to ESG best practices. The research assessed 15 significant 

natural rubber companies on leading company disclosure practices. The scoring was based on each company’s practices and 

policies across ten key criteria.

Halcyon was rated as the second most transparent natural rubber producing company globally with a total score of 69.9%. Our score 

is double the average score of 35% among major natural rubber companies and shows our strong commitment to transparency and 

sustainable practices. Our scores against all ten assessment categories are presented in the chart below.

For more details, please visit https://www.spott.org/natural-rubber/halcyon-agri/

EcoVadis Business Sustainability Ratings Gives us a Silver 

2019 marked our third EcoVadis supplier assessment evaluation. We went through our first evaluation in 2015 and obtained a score 

of 38/100 coming in at the 37th percentile amongst our peers. Our second assessment in 2017 witnessed our score increase to 

45/100 and we maintained our bronze rating. Our performance amongst peers has improved significantly, with Halcyon Agri coming 

in at the 55% percentile. The latest assessment witnessed our overall score leap to 55/100 and attain a silver rating for the first time. 

We are now in the top 79% percentile amongst our industry peers, making us a sustainability leader in the natural rubber industry. 

Our scores for each component were higher than the industry average, with the areas of environment and ethics strong with a 

weighted score of 60/100. The scores for sustainable procurement and labour &amp; human rights had a weighted score of 50/100 for 

each component. For our upcoming assessment in 2021, we hope to increase our overall score by another 10%. We understand and 

acknowledge that the EcoVadis supplier assessment tool remains the most robust in the industry and we strive to meet the higher 

standards and expectations placed by the assessment framework.

Sustainalytics ESG Report Rating 

 

We obtained a total score of 64/100 for our 2019 ESG assessment by ratings agency, Sustainalytics, coming in at the 65th 

percentile amongst our peers in the assessment category. We were assessed across 30 criteria which focuses on ESG’s policy, 

implementation, monitoring and measurement. There are no strong controversies reported in our operations and the ESG factors 

assessed were deemed to be of medium business and sustainability impact, and our preparedness led us to a neutral overall 

rating to ESG management. We have sound policies and programmes for managing material ESG issues relative to our peers in 

the assessed category. We hope to improve on our overall ESG score in 2020 through increased disclosures in data sets, trends 

and policy implementation. We recognise that ESG dynamics will continue to evolve and we need to be nimble in addressing and 

managing the ESG risks.

Workplace Health and Safety 

Our commitment to health and safety is embedded in our Sustainable Natural Rubber Supply Chain Policy (SNRSCP). All our 

processing sites across Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Africa and Thailand are HeveaPRO-certified. All our HeveaPRO-certified sites 

have health and safety committees which are represented jointly by workers and management. The committees are implemented 

at a local level across our operations and report directly to senior management. Depending on customer requirements, our factories 

also possess various ISO certifications. All our factories are ISO9001-certified. We have 20 factories certified to ISO14001, and three 

factories certified to ISO18001. In 2019, we conducted an engagement session with our factory teams in Indonesia. The session 

aimed to strengthen implementation of our HeveaPRO integrated management system. The session facilitated the development 

of a global three-year plan starting 2020. This roadmap aims to strengthen accountability of environment, health and safety (EHS) 

activities across all levels in the organisation from factory to headquarters. This will be supplemented by EHS training and education 

programmes. We aim to have all ISO14001 certified factories transit to the latest ISO 14001: 2015 standards and move towards 

transiting our ISO18001-certified factories to ISO 45001: 2018. We remain on track to transit our factories to the latest versions 

of international management standards. Through the three-year plan, we hope to strengthen our implementation of HeveaPRO, 

ISO14001, ISO45001 and other relevant certification standards.

We are fortunate to report zero fatalities for 2019 and aim to achieve zero for 2020. We have also noted higher rates for female 

employees in relation to absenteeism, injuries, disease and lost days. In response, we will conduct root cause analyses to better 

understand these statistics. We will use 2019 data as benchmark for setting targets and monitoring progress.

Our Group performance for Injury Rates in 2019 increased by 

15% over previous year and is the highest in the last three years. 

The increase was driven by incidences at our African operations 

with a number of reported field injuries from our rubber-tapping 

workers in Cameroon and operations-related injuries from our 

factory workers in Ivory Coast. 

Our performance on Lost Day Rates showed a 40% increase 

compared with the previous year but is still below the reported 

rate in 2017. Our operations in Cameroon, Malaysia and 

Thailand reported a higher number of lost days than previous 

Travel Safety

As part of our commitment to workplace health and safety, 

Halcyon also provides employees with medical, safety and 

security expertise and emergency evacuation when travelling 

for business via International SOS, the world’s leading medical 

and travel security risk services company. This reinforces 

the health and safety of our mobile workers, international 

assignees and their dependants by giving them access to 

country-specific risk ratings, expert medical and travel security 

advice or referrals, and 24/7 assistance prior to travel, during 

travel, and in the event of an incident. 

years. Lost days were a result of accumulated recovery time 

from injuries sustained by workers at our operations. Injuries 

reported include insect bites, slips and falls, cuts and fractures, 

and contact with chemicals from activities such as fieldwork, 

work at height, machine operation and rubber tapping. Guided 

by our EHS plan and strengthened implementation of HeveaPRO 

standards and other health and safety management systems, 

we aim to reduce our group overall injury rates and lost days 

from 2020. We will achieve this through strengthening EHS 

accountability across organisational levels and delivering 

targeted training and education programmes to our site teams.

 

Our partnership with International SOS also allows us 

to accurately locate our mobile workers and international 

assignees in the event of an incident, to be able to respond 

effectively and take appropriate measures to safeguard their 

health and safety. Thanks to our digital travel risk mitigation 

programme, we have implemented health and safety 

management practices that identify, eliminate, mitigate, or 

avoid foreseeable occupational health and safety incidents for 

all of our mobile workers and international assignees especially 

when Halcyon has no control of the workplace(s) involved. This 

forms part of our risk management strategy to fuel business 

growth and productivity.

per worker in the previous year. Preparedness training was mainly on fire prevention and protection followed by emergency 

preparedness, EHS inductions and awareness, and first aid. For hazards, most training related to physical hazards such as working 

at height, confined spaces, machine and tools operations, and road safety. Chemicals handling, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 

usage and maintenance, personal hygiene and sanitation and proper posture and movement are some of the topics covered under 

biological, chemical and ergonomic hazards training. Tracking our training activities will enable us to formulate effective policies 

and practices supporting our global EHS roadmap.

Women’s Empowerment

Female empowerment remains both an opportunity and social 

challenge in many societies, and we recognise our responsibility 

to accelerate gender equity and equality throughout our supply 

chains.

Community forums provide large platforms to disseminate 

messages of empowerment. Last year, our communities 

held various celebrations such as International Women’s 

Day, African Women’s Day and the International Day of Rural 

Women. We continued our support for marital unions following 

the memorable wedding of almost 60 couples in Cameroon 

presided over by the Lord Mayor of Niete Sub-division, Mengue 

Jean Jaures on the International Day of Rural Women in 2019. 

Our support for these legalised unions ensures that the rights 

of married women are given stronger protection. In addition, we 

plan to formalise birth certificates of unregistered children in 

collaboration with the district’s Social Affairs Department and 

the Court of Kribi, Cameroon. 

We continue to increase the scale of our drive to recruit more 

women as we recognise the need for women to provide 

additional income for their families to improve their quality 

of life. More training programmes and childcare facilities 

will be developed, freeing many women from the barriers 

hampering their professional development. We will also focus 

on campaigns fighting gender violence and sexual abuse. 

We remain committed to support gender equity and equality 

throughout our operations.















Traceable Supply Chain

Traceability has become a fundamental requirement for the 

natural rubber industry. Rubberway and HeveaTrace are tools 

that help to identify and profile smallholder farmers to enable 

greater transparency in the supply chain. While both tools 

are different in their approach, they have the common goal of 

ensuring a sustainable supply chain. 

Rubberway is a smartphone application co-created by Michelin, 

Continental and SMAG. It is designed to map sustainability 

activities across the natural rubber industry by assessing 

practices and risks relating to human rights, environmental 

protection, social development, and source provenance. More 

specifically, Rubberway’s overall assessment is obtained from 

12 risk indicators:

As of December 2019, Halcyon has rolled out Rubberway to 

12 administrative divisions across Thailand and Indonesia, 

reaching approximately 1,600 smallholder farmers in our 

supply chain. The results provide a detailed breakdown of 

geographic risks inherent in the locations we operate. From 

human rights and social development indicators, we observed 

that low rubber prices are affecting the incomes of smallholder 

farmers and in many cases have resulted in reduced incomes 

below legal minimum wages. We also observed a lack of access 

to knowledge on best agriculture practices for farmers. This 

poses supply chain risks as farmers are not able to optimise 

tree productivity and thus enhance their yields. 

Low yields directly translate to reduced incomes for farmers. 

HeveaGROW training modules will address these issues for 

farmers, especially in locations where this has been identified 

as a risk. Biodiversity conservation and protection also poses 

a supply chain risk as farmers are not made aware of the 

importance to preserve biological assets. The training also

HeveaTRACE 

Another initiative is HeveaTRACE. Developed by Halcyon, it 

is a supply-chain traceability tool to map and provide data 

from smallholder farmers to processing mills with key ESG 

metrics. The tool aims to provide visibility and transparency 

of the supply chain while achieving the UN Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs). While Rubberway adopts a risk-

based qualitative approach to supply chain traceability and 

transparency, HeveaTRACE provides a quantitative approach to 

assess socio-economic and environmental issues within the 

natural rubber supply chain.

 

Using CropIN’s smartphone based application, HeveaConnect 

field staff traced and profiled 1,000 smallholder farmers in 

Jambi province, Indonesia. Farmer plots were geo-tagged and 

GPS coordinates captured together with qualitative information

on the sub-districts and villages where farmers reside. The GPS 

coordinates show the source provenance of natural rubber 

being processed at Halcyon factories in Jambi. The farmers 

were surveyed in various regencies to obtain a representative 

sample size across Jambi. Information gathered from 

smallholder farmers include family unit size, land area and 

location, income levels and farm maintenance practices. 

Any information gathered is kept confidential and secure. 

HeveaTRACE aims to provide the information to meet upstream 

traceability requirements of tyre companies and natural rubber 

processors stated in their respective sustainability policies.  

The results from the concurrent rollout of HeveaTRACE and 

Rubberway have been complimentary. For instance, prolonged 

low natural rubber market prices were equally reflected in both 

rollouts as farmers struggled to secure sufficient incomes 

to feed their families, send their children to school and pay 

their utility bills. This translated to longer working hours in the 

field, sometimes for up to six days compared with three days 

previously. Both rollouts also indicated a need for technical 

assistance to manage pests and diseases in the field. We found 

that rubber trees were affected and destroyed by termites, 

leaf blight and white root fungus disease but farmers lack of 

knowledge about the application of fertilisers. The strong call 

for agricultural training and assistance for smallholder farmers 

resonated across both approaches. HeveaGROW will address 

these issues via modular training videos on best agricultural 

practices. 

HeveaTRACE has also met its target of surveying 1,000 

smallholder farmers from June to December 2019. The 

data collected provided us with interesting insights. For 

example, there were significantly more farmers obtaining 

their income from multiple streams  compared with a 

single income stream from natural rubber in some regencies 

than others. We also used the freely available Global Forest 

Watch (GFW) Pro tool to conduct deforestation alerts, tree cover 

loss and land conversion analysis on the smallholder farmer 

plots and found that the deforestation alerts in August and 

September 2019 correlated well with haze episodes.

 

HeveaTRACE will now focus on  impact monitoring and 

measurement. Having traced farmers to source and developed a 

database of their profiles and geo-locations, HeveaTRACE 

would segment farmers based on their income profile and offer 

targeted assistance. The identified farmers will be trained via 

the HeveaGROW programme to improve agricultural practices 

and secure better prices for their rubber. Where needed, 

agricultural resources will also be provided to them. These 

farmers can then adopt a collective selling model and transact 

with factories through a collection station. This direct selling 

method will enable farmers to secure higher prices for their 

rubber without needing to go through and negotiate with 

intermediaries. The impact of any training can be measured by 

assessing the improvement in quality and Dry Rubber Content 

(DRC) of rubber purchased at the collection stations. After this 

pilot implementation, we will assess if this collective selling 

model can be scaled up.  

 

The HeveaTRACE questionnaire to profile farmers will be 

expanded to address all other relevant sustainability policy 

requirements of tyre companies and processors to make this 

more suite. The data collected will feed into an ESG risk matrix 

with an ESG risk score assigned to each regency. 

Partnership for Sustainable and Traceable Supply Chain 

We have been in partnership with a major tyre customer 

since 2017 to pilot a fully traceable system for natural rubber 

production in Kalimantan, Indonesia. As part of the programme, 

a targeted group of smallholders in the pilot area are trained 

to grow high-quality rubber in accordance with a set of 

clearly defined sustainability criteria developed by a third-

party agency. A mobile application has been developed to 

facilitate the collection and registration of farmers’ details and 

to track transactions made. To safeguard the traceability of raw 

material, a dedicated collection point was set up to support the 

collection of raw material from these registered farmers. The 

traceable raw material will be sent to our designated factory in 

Kalimantan and be processed separately for delivery to the said 

tyre customer. This pilot project exemplifies a 100% traceable 

and sustainable natural rubber supply chain. Smallholders 

who participate in this project are rewarded with better prices 

compared to non-traceable raw material.

Smallholder Capacity Building (HeveaGROW)

HeveaGROW is an initiative by HeveaConnect focused on 

curating and providing natural rubber smallholder farmers with 

best agronomical practices to improve yields. Our engagement 

with smallholder farmers through Rubberway and HeveaTRACE 

in Indonesia has found that they lack information on good 

agronomical practices but that they are eager to gain access to 

these. HeveaGROW is the bridge to impart knowledge on best 

practices to smallholder farmers. By collaborating with SNV, a 

Dutch-based non-profit international development organisation 

with strong expertise in farmer training and development within 

the natural rubber industry, HeveaConnect is working to develop 

digital content for smallholder natural rubber farmers. 

We are working on five modules on Best Management 

Practices (BMP) that address key elements of rubber tapping, 

agroforestry, crop maintenance, pest management and natural 

rubber storage and processing. By digitising training material, 

we can offer this to a wider group. This would improve farmer 

yields which translates to increased incomes and improved 

livelihoods. Land stewardship is enhanced through sustainable 

land clearing practices in line with the Group’s Sustainable 

Natural Rubber Supply Chain Policy. 

HeveaGROW’s format using bite-sized modular videos offer 

a more targeted approach to training and will allow easier 

assimilation of knowledge. Trainers are able to quantify yield 

improvement within specific periods and conduct analysis to 

correlate it with income improvement.  

HeveaConnect and SNV signed a Memorandum of Understanding 

(MOU) in February 2019. SNV provided the training content and 

framework with HeveaConnect adding technical and digital 

expertise to shoot and curate the video series. Fieldwork for the 

project commenced in October 2019, and the storyboard and 

video for the first module were completed by the end of 2019. 

Feedback was obtained from about 30 smallholder farmers 

from Jambi province and incorporated into the final product.

HeveaConnect will continue to collaborate with SNV to complete 

the creation of all modules in the first half of 2020. These videos 

will be translated to other languages for interested stakeholders 

to target farmers in other areas. The key goal of HeveaGROW 

remains to impart best management practices to smallholder 

farmers not only in Indonesia but in other rubber-producing 

countries.





Community Investment

Across our operations in West &amp; Central Africa, China and Southeast Asia, we implemented various development and engagement 

programmes with local communities. In 2019, we invested an estimated US$656,000 globally in these activities. Almost 50% of 

this amount was spent on smallholder empowerment through skills training, contribution of equipment and planting material and 

direct purchase of raw materials through programmes like the Outgrower Programme in Africa. Approximately 23% was spent 

on education support through in-kind donation of school supplies and sponsorship of teacher wages. The rest of the funds were 

spent on in-kind or as monetary donations to activities ranging from local cultural and religious activities, healthcare programmes, 

sports for persons with disabilities, community financial assistance and infrastructure projects. We share notable examples from 

our territories in this report.

Halcyon Agri also supported the disabled community by 

becoming the title sponsor of the International Wheelchair 

Rugby Super Series 2019 in collaboration with BSF Asia, 

a non-profit organisation that aims to improve the lives of 

persons with disabilities through the power of sport and 

play. Wheelchair Rugby is a Paralympic sport recognised by 

the Singapore Disability Sports Council and is played in over 

twenty-five countries around the world. Studies have shown that 

Paralympic sports promote resilience, enhance self-esteem and 

self-efficacy among persons with disabilities. The Super Series 

aimed to promote these values and build awareness as well on 

their greater inclusion in society.

The Super Series was held throughout the year across Malaysia 

(Ipoh), Indonesia (Bali and Palembang) and finally Singapore 

which hosted the finals matches. Cheered on by their families 

and friends, teams across Indonesia, Malaysia, Europe and 

Singapore played against each other and displayed great 

sportsmanship and camaraderie. 

Almost a hundred of our staff volunteered their time to assist 

the match organisers, BSF Asia. At least 1,400 volunteer hours 

were spent to ensure the success of each match. The event not

Corrie MacColl believes that accessible healthcare is key 

to a thriving society. 2019 saw the coordination of several 

large-scale awareness campaigns across our Cameroon 

plantations, supported by the Cameroonian authorities that 

aided communities in prioritising good health. 

In advocating prevention over cure, we had a vaccination 

campaign of 2,500 young children against Rubella and 

Measles. We also conducted a Malaria awareness campaign 

and distributed over 15,300 mosquito nets. Through educational 

talks, games and interactive sessions, our health teams 

encouraged more open dialogue surrounding the management 

of health risks; an approach that resulted in over 2,000 people 

participating in our 2019 HIV-AIDS awareness and testing 

campaign. These initiatives add to the permanent community 

facilities of two hospitals with ambulances and the 23 medical 

dispensaries.

Our Chinese operations in 2019 heeded the call of United 

Nations and the Chinese government to support a poverty 

alleviation programme for a Mange village, a community located 

in Yunnan Province. The project aimed to increase total income 

through the provision of employment opportunities and raw 

material purchase from villagers. 

The project was completed in December 2019 with the following 

outcomes achieved: (1) 20 jobs offered to villagers, (2) Direct 

purchase of natural rubber raw material from Mange village with 

a value at almost 2 million Yuan, (3) Assistance in establishing 

a purchasing site, and (4) In-kind donation of raw material 

handling equipment. Moving forward, we will continue to work 

with local governments to promote community investment

The programmes were launched as competitions, with factory 

management setting participation rules and sponsoring 

materials and equipment for cleaning and decorating housing 

blocks. Judges then conducted inspections and chose the 

winning blocks with the winners given cash prizes.

Beyond holding the competition, the campaign was successful 

in promoting cleanliness in and outside of the home and building 

good hygiene and healthy living habits for our employees and 

their families. A spirit of neighbourliness was also observed as 

families came out to clean common housing areas and set up 

of a community pharmacy. The factory also saw an estimated 

70% reduction in annual contracted maintenance and cleaning 

costs as a result of the campaign. The plan is to introduce this 

programme to other factories in our group.

Malaysia

As a matter of company policy, our plantation teams regularly 

interact with neighbouring stakeholders including other 

companies and villagers. These interactions aim to understand 

common concerns or issues. At our estate in Malaysia, we learned 

that a bridge used by our plantation team and stakeholders was 

in a state of disrepair. In response, we engaged in a concerted 

effort with local officials and villagers and a timber company 

to rebuild the bridge. 

In-kind contributions were made with the timber company 

providing logs, Halcyon supplying heavy equipment and 

construction material, and villagers providing manpower. A 

temporary wooden bridge was built first to allow continued 

access for all users while an iron bridge will be built by the 

end of 2020 for permanent long-term use. The collaboration 

provided mutual benefits for all parties as it will provide a 

commuting route for local villagers and strategic access for 

companies such as Halcyon who have operations in the area. 

The collaboration will continue to ensure regular structural 

monitoring and inspection of the bridge. 

Thailand

In our Thai operations Teck Bee Hang (TBH), our team initiated 

a supplier engagement workshop in partnership with our 

customer, Bridgestone. The workshop aimed to raise awareness 

on the benefits of good quality rubber and issues arising from 

raw material contamination. 

Over 50 dealer representatives attended the one-day workshop 

which was delivered by Bridgestone and TBH. For dealers and 

farmers, good quality rubber can command a better price. For 

processors and customers, good quality rubber means less 

water and electricity consumption and waste generation in the 

production of tyres.

TBH, together with Bridgestone and dealers aims to reach out 

to farmers and build awareness on the negative effects of 

contamination and promote mutual benefits of ensuring good 

rubber quality across the supply chain.

CASE STUDIES

Outgrower Programme 

The Outgrower Programme is our latest strategic measure in 

improving the livelihoods and economic viability of the rural 

communities that border our plantations. The objective of 

the programme is to educate and empower smallholders in 

possession of degraded or fallow land and assist them to 

create multi-crop farms around a core of natural rubber. The 

guaranteed purchasing of raw material and the teaching of 

agronomical best practices will create sustainable employment 

and strengthen rural economies.

The programme was first launched in Cameroon with 

the participation of approximately 13,000 Cameroonian 

smallholders. 27,000 hectares of land has been earmarked, 

with an initial development of 750 hectares in 2019. Land 

within High Conservation Value or High Carbon Stock areas 

are exempted, and appropriate land deeds were secured prior 

to development. To ensure best practice and to adhere to 

our SNRSCP, all candidate-smallholders must undergo rigorous 

sustainability assessments while the independent Cameroon 

Sustainability Council has full oversight of the programme. 

Based on an integrated farming model, rubber trees are 

intercropped with plantain, maize, red bean, watermelon 

or groundnuts, and combined with livestock of fish, pigs or 

chicken. This model brings opportunities for food security and 

trade between farmers.

Smallholder Financing Study

The natural rubber industry is supported by approximately 

six million smallholder farmers mostly in remote regions 

of developing economies. Living and working conditions of 

these farmers vary greatly depending on their geographical 

location. At current prices, it seems that the average monthly 

earnings of a smallholder farmer in Indonesia is typically US$85, 

representing less than 50% of the country’s minimum wage. 

This is neither acceptable nor sustainable over the long term, 

both in terms of farmer remuneration as well as security of 

future rubber supply.

HeveaConnect entered into a partnership with United States 

Agency for International Development Green Invest Asia (USAID 

GIA) in February 2019 to commission a study to understand 

smallholder economics in the natural rubber supply chain 

in Indonesia. The study aims to gather information required 

to design a mechanism to finance smallholders producing 

rubber at scale. The study will quantify the need for finance in 

replanting rubber trees on smallholders’ plantations, identify 

obstacles currently hindering financing, assess the trade-

offs in alternative financing mechanisms and review the 

role of agents and intermediaries in the value chain. The 

study is conducted jointly by a group of stakeholders which 

include USAID GIA , HeveaConnect, Financial Access and SNV 

Indonesia (SNV). The study report will be shared publicly in 

2020. 

 

A pioneering study focused on smallholder livelihoods in 

Indonesia, this project brings together various stakeholders 

within the natural rubber supply chain looking to evaluate 

the feasibility of a self-sustaining financial model to enhance 

natural rubber farmer livelihoods in Indonesia. The outcomes 

of this study are critical as the low natural rubber market 

prices witnessed in 2019, has, together with the lopsided price 

disparity between farmers and dealers for rubber, pushed many 

farmers in Indonesia to depressed earnings and be saddled in 

debt. There is therefore an urgent need to address inequality 

within the natural rubber supply chain. 

The outcomes of this study will be put to test in a planned 

pilot second phase. The key intention would be to determine if 

the financial model derived from the study is feasible and has 

the potential to be scaled up. In the first half of 2020, USAID 

GIA and the other stakeholders involved in the project will be 

approaching potential donors to raise initial funds for the pilot 

rollout.  

The study is based on desk research and supplemented by 

interviews with collection intermediaries, processors, banks, 

MFIs, service providers, potential donors and NGOs. Some of the 

desk studies involved value chain mapping, exploring various 

sustainability standards linked to natural rubber, examining 

the ESG risks within the natural rubber supply chain, existing 

finance for smallholders and the role of offtake agreements. 

Surveys were carried out with about 250 smallholders and 

other stakeholders in Sumatra and Kalimantan and involved 

collection of key socio-economic data pertaining to their family 

size, income derived from natural rubber, income from other 

activities, types of agricultural material and clones used and 

knowledge of the natural rubber market. 

The portion of the study focused  on the development 

of smallholder financing model with data gathered from 

farmer surveys. The detailed level of data collected has 

provided accurate insights for the development of a financial 

model. This information was fed into a fund structuring and 

design for a pilot rollout.

HALCYON AGRI’S 2019 - CORPORATE REPORT



Cameroon Sustainability Council

In April 2019, our Group established the Cameroon Sustainability 

Council (CSC), an independent body that brings together 

international, multi-stakeholder individuals along the value chain, 

uniting over a progressive agenda of ecological conservation 

and socio-economic development. The Founding Members 

represent leading institutions in business, politics and NGOs 

who are deeply committed to monitoring the implementation 

of the Group’s Sustainable Natural Rubber Supply Chain Policy 

(SNRSCP) and other external party recommendations. 

The Council will act independently of management and 

shareholders, and has extensive rights of information, 

consultation and initiative. Civil society on the Council is 

represented by Mighty Earth and Community Forests Platform 

(PFC). Mighty Earth, a global pro-environmental NGO, and PFC, 

a Cameroonian national civil society representing over 50 local 

NGOs, will help the Council guide sustainable, community-led 

rubber production in Cameroon. This collaboration emphasises 

discussion and input at local level – and ensure that indigenous 

and local communities have a voice in all council decisions.

Formation of Community Forest

In June 2019, we announced the formation of our 25,000 

hectare Community Forest within the Sudcam concession – a 

land space equal to four times the size of Manhattan Island. 

A legal boundary has been established around the Community 

Forest perimeter and working with local and international NGOs 

and the Cameroon government, this permanently protects 

the land and its ecosystems. The Forest also ensures that 

indigenous communities have continued access to forest 

resources. Employment opportunities will be created for local 

people in the management of the land, which is strategically 

governed by the Cameroon Sustainability Council and other 

specialist agencies.

The Community Forest runs adjacent to the UNESCO World 

Heritage Dja Faunal Reserve, home to many species of 

State-of-the-Art Factory and Laboratory

Motivated by our ambition to supply responsibly-produced 

rubber, we constructed a state-of-the-art factory and laboratory 

in Sudcam, Cameroon. Factory operations will commence from 

first half 2020 with an estimated annual production capacity 

of 45,00 mT. The Sudcam factory is expected to produce 75% 

centrifuged latex and 25% cup lump grades certified against 

HeveaTRACE and LatexPRO processing standards. The 1,200 

audit-point certification will ensure the highest standards 

of quality, worker safety and environmental sustainability. 

With the adoption of heightened efficiency measures and 

installation of advanced equipment such as centrifuges, the 

factory is expected to consume energy efficiently and minimise 

generation of waste. Other features that distinguish the factory 

include: 

- Advanced effluent treatment systems to target zero effluent 

discharge

- Rainwater collection systems on the roof and factory 

surroundings to minimise water required from surrounding 

rivers 

conservation concern, including vulnerable forest elephants 

(Loxodonta Cyclotis), endangered chimpanzees (Pan 

troglodytes) and critically endangered western lowland gorillas 

(Gorilla gorilla) – classified according to the IUCN Red List.  The 

independent Cameroon Sustainability Council ensures that the 

Reserve’s animals remain unaffected by our activities. 

In support of conservation efforts, we signed a five-year 

convention in 2018 continuing our assistance since 2013 in 

the fight against poaching at Dja Reserve. Activities supported 

by our assistance include biodiversity monitoring, anti-poaching 

patrols, staff training and local community engagement. 

With 70% of our Cameroon plantation to remain non-planted 

– including 8,000 hectares of High Conservation Value (HCV) 

and High Carbon Stock (HCS) land – our conservation efforts 

at Dja Reserve aim to protect the unique habitats and species 

that exist in the Congo basin. 

- Solar panels installed to power the office

- Green corridors and soil erosion control

Technical expertise is provided by the Group’s Ohio, USA 

based Momentum Technologies Laboratories (MTL) to the on-

site natural rubber and latex laboratory. Planned as an extension 

of the Ohio facility, MTL oversees equipment selection, training 

and certification of the Sudcam laboratory. Development of this 

modern and state-of-the-art factory and laboratory will enable 

the Group to host research and development activities such as 

specialty products and formulation testing.

Sudcam factory’s raw material output will be 100% traceable 

as supply will be provided by the Outgrower Programme. 

Furthermore, the plantation’s sustainability practices are 

overseen and governed by both local and international NGOs, as 

well as the Cameroon Sustainability Council. With raw material 

set to feed the modern factory – flanked by the state-of-the-art 

laboratory – Sudcam will solidify Cameroon as a producer of 

certified sustainable, quality rubber and latex, produced to 

individual customer requirements.

Water Consumption and Management

Over 90% of our group’s water consumption occurs at our rubber processing sites. This is because large volumes of water are 

required to remove physical impurities from rubber to meet quality requirements. With most of our factories located in urban or semi-

urban areas and with the looming threat of climate change to our communities, it is crucial for us to manage our water resources 

responsibly. Our processing sites draw water primarily from surface water bodies and discharge them back to the same source. 

Surface water consumption is supplemented by drawing from local water utilities where available5.Through teams across sites, we 

actively track our water consumption in our processing sites as frequently as on a shift basis. 

At our plantations, we mainly source from ground and surface 

water, as these sites are largely located in rural areas. Water 

is consumed for domestic use at staff housing facilities and 

watering activities across our planted estates. Sewage is 

collected through septic tanks and maintained regularly by 

plantation teams. Discharge from other domestic uses and 

watering activities return back to groundwater or surface water 

in accordance with local effluent limits

Through the years, we have endeavoured to reduce our 

reliance on freshwater sources as this not only supports eco-

efficient behaviour but also realises cost efficiencies in our 

operations. Through implementing our HeveaPRO standards on 

environmental management and educating our factory teams 

on responsible water management, we have realised a gradual 

improvement in our group-wide water recycling rates from 33% 

in 20176 to 43% in 2019. 

Over a three-year period, we experienced an increase in total 

water recycled and a reduction in total water consumption. This 

is attributable to the application of our Halcyon Data Centre 

(HDC). More than just a reporting tool, HDC allows factory 

teams to track their operational performance – including water 

consumption data – and set targets. As a result, our site teams 

have become more aware of their resource consumption and 

take proactive steps in improving efficiency In 2020, we aim to 

reduce our total water consumption by 5% and will continue 

our efforts to improve our water consumption efficiency over 

the long term.

Water Stewardship Action Learning Project in PT Hok Tong, Jambi

The Action Learning Project (ALP) of the Global Agribusiness 

Alliance (GAA) was a collaboration between AWS Asia-Pacific 

Indonesia (AWS A-P Indonesia), Halcyon, and HeveaConnect. 

This project provided an opportunity for HeveaConnect to 

set standards for sustainably-processed natural rubber and 

promote the uptake of good water stewardship in the water-

intensive rubber sector and enable informed decision-making. 

The ALP consisted of two components: 1) An AWS assessment 

of Halcyon’s factory in Jambi and 2) A survey of all Halcyon 

rubber processing sites in Indonesia. The site-level AWS 

assessment focussed on the first two steps of the AWS 

Standard, to provide the site and company with insights into 

readiness for AWS certification and provide recommendations 

at site level to improve water-related performance. 

AWS A-P collaborated with engineering firm PT Witteveen+Bos 

Indonesia as part of this assessment. As this ALP was geared 

towards a pilot case to improve water stewardship at site 

and company level, the gap analysis was strengthened with 

additional data gathering, analysis and recommended actions.

The assessment provided: 

1) insights into current gaps according to the AWS core 

indicators, 

2)  recommendations on how to tackle gaps, and 

3) additional analysis and recommendations on site and 

catchment data. 

The assessment provided insights on water risks and 

opportunities, water quality and regulations, and multi 

stakeholder collaborations. Stakeholders were identified 

through research and interviews with various site staff. 

Stakeholders such as government, private sector, civil society 

organizations and other water users of the site were mapped 

against their level of influence to the site and the impact of 

the site to their activities. The resulting analysis provided 

recommendations on ways to engage these stakeholders.

A site water balance was also 

established to identify and map each 

main water flow and water storage 

component on-site. The water flows 

of the site were divided into two 

parts: office and factory. It was found 

that the largest component in water 

consumption for the site was the water 

used in the factory, which is catchment 

river water.

Water consumption in the catchment remained well below water yield, which indicates sufficient water availability throughout the 

year. The water intake accounted for a total estimated amount of approximately 1.14 million m3 of water per year. Technical findings 

for the site included the need for flood protection, improvement in septic tanks, storage and use of rainwater and optimisation of 

wastewater treatment process to enable cost savings. Shared water challenges included climate change, stricter environmental 

water regulation and low access to Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH). Indirect water was found to potentially pose the highest 

legal and reputational risks.

The survey for all the rubber-processing sites was organised around four main topics and sets of sub-questions as presented in 

the chart below. These provided insights into site perceptions on water risks, water infrastructure and functioning, the extent of 

site-level interventions related to water, and the sites’ interest and ability to improve environmental performance related to water.

The next steps for Halcyon factories would involve focusing on legal compliance, monitoring water consumption and identifying 

cost-saving measures. Engaging with key stakeholders, targeting mainly local government and rubber farmers to gather catchment 

data, assessing opportunities for collaboration, and strengthening existing initiatives related to water is key. Further studies can 

be undertaken to analyse embedded water risks in rubber growing areas providing supplies to our factories and to integrate more 

in-depth analysis of water risks and opportunities in the overall strategy for the management of rubber processing sites.

Energy consumption

Producing natural rubber requires significant energy input 

across various sources. To maintain operational continuity, 

we consume multiple energy sources where it is locally 

accessible and reliable. Electricity consumption is measured 

through metered connections from the national grid. Site teams 

measure fuel consumption through duly-calibrated meters 

and weighing scales and reported to our company’s central 

data centre. 

Our largest energy source is from purchased electricity 

comprising about 38% of our requirements across the years. 

The next significant contribution comes from natural gas used 

primarily for drying process at our factories. With access to 

biomass (palm kernel) in Indonesia, we steadily increased its 

application for our dry process infrastructure, supplementing 

fuel and gas consumption over time. As of 2019, biomass 

consumption stood at 10% of our total energy needs, up from 

4% in 2017. Our liquid fuels, mainly diesel, are used for dryers 

and on-site generators either for back up purpose or as main 

electricity source at off-grid locations. 

Across our plantations, the primary energy source is liquid 

fuels mainly diesel and petrol. This contributed to a notable 

increase in diesel consumption in 2019 compared with previous 

years. On coal consumption, we experienced higher production 

volumes at our Chinese factories which caused a slight increase 

in consumption and emissions in 20197. 

Overall, we report steady improvement of our energy intensity 

over the last three years at 1.758 GJ of energy consumed per 

mT of natural rubber produced from our operations in 2019.

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions

Climate change and global warming remains a key concern 

across our supply chain. We are committed in reducing our 

emissions over the long term. Our greenhouse gas emissions 

calculations applied guidance from The Greenhouse Gas 

Protocol8. Fuel emission factors for each reported year were 

taken from the UK Government GHG Conversion factors for 

Company Reporting9 while grid emission factors were obtained 

from Trucost.

The largest contribution to total emissions comes from our 

Scope 2 emissions (purchased electricity) with an average of 

70% across the years. Scope 1 emissions (direct emissions) 

account for about 30% with natural gas, liquid fuels and coal 

accounting for 12%, 11% and 7% respectively in 2019. Biomass 

use contributed to approximately 0.2% of GHG emissions. 

Emissions from natural gas reduced gradually from 2017 due 

to reduced consumption. Liquid fuels consumption increased 

in 2019 with the reporting of fuels use from our plantations. 

Biomass: Towards decarbonising our processing operations 

In line with our support for the UN SDGs and our sustained 

push towards decarbonising our energy portfolio, we steadily 

increased the number of factories adopting the use of biomass 

(palm kernels) in their operational processes. Currently, eight of 

our factories in Indonesia fuel their dryers by palm kernels, with 

the first biomass heat exchange system implemented in 2010. 

The current average market price of palm kernel is about US$ 

45 dollars per mT. This offers a cheaper fuel option compared 

with diesel, natural gas, coal and electricity from the grid. 

Emissions from coal consumption increased contribution 

slightly (0.7%) in 2019 compared to 2018 but remained within 

the 6 to 7% range across the years.

We reported 2018 as our base year for GHG emissions in 

our previous report. As we improve the robustness of our 

reported data, we are considering applying an average of annual 

emissions over a few years as a base figure. Such averaging is 

in line with guidance provided in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

GHG emissions intensity decreased steadily over the last three 

(3) years with 2019 at 0.221 tCO2e per mT of product. When 

compared on a per revenue basis, our average intensity from 

2017 to 2019 is at 0.095 tCO2e per US$’000. Overall, we attribute 

reduction of our emissions on a per product basis from dryer 

retrofitting initiatives in the past several years. Retrofitting of our 

dryers provides the ability to combust natural gas or biomass 

alongside or as a replacement to liquid fuel (diesel). The case 

below reports on our experience with biomass fuels.

Operational efficiency is not compromised as the burners 

require an average of 110 kg of palm kernels to dry 1 mT of 

Standard Indonesia Rubber (SIR). Therefore, for a production of 

4000 mT of dry rubber, only about 440 mT of palm kernels are 

required. Production of large volumes of rubber is supported by 

the processing capacity of the heat exchange systems. With an 

average production capacity of 5.3 mT of SIR per hour, our palm 

kernel based heat exchange systems are well placed to meet 

high volume production demands with no quality compromise.

Our modelling studies have shown that palm kernels contribute 

significantly towards carbon emissions reduction. Comparing 

an energy portfolio comprising grid electricity and diesel with 

a portfolio comprising grid electricity, diesel and palm kernels, 

there is an observable reduction of approximately 30% in the 

carbon emissions intensity for the production of per mT of 

dry rubber. More significantly, there is an approximate 60% 

reduction in absolute emissions for the production of per 

mT dry rubber. Not only do palm kernels present an option of 

enhanced efficiency and cost savings, they also play a huge role 

in decarbonising our operational energy portfolio. 

Kelvin Terminals: Greening the largest latex terminal in Europe 

Following a €3.2 million investment, Kelvin Terminals in 

Terneuzen, the Netherlands completed their largest expansion 

in over 50 years to become the largest latex-dedicated 

storage facility in Europe. The latex terminal accommodates 

approximately 20 trucks per day with capacity at 6,500 mT 

and 1,700 mT of natural and synthetic latex respectively. 

The expansion offers a wider range of capabilities that will 

support both our general commodity latex business and 

our diversification into the niche and premium grades that 

customers increasingly request. The investment represents 

Corrie MacColl’s commitment to offer customers a best-in-

class support facility. 

In 2019, the terminal completed installation of 126 solar 

panels on the roof of the new tank hall, with output capacity of 

51,000 kWh per annum, providing the terminal the capability of 

producing close to 100% of electricity needs of site operations. 

This also supplements the installed air-source heat pumps that 

cut the site’s dependence on liquid fuels.

In the coming years and in line with our emissions reduction 

plans, we will assess operational feasibility and transit more 

of our factories to incorporate palm kernels in their fuel 

mix. Furthermore, we target a reduction in our total energy 

consumption by 3% in 2020. This target aims to positively affect 

our overall GHG emissions performance.

Waste, Chemicals and Effluent Quality

In line with our SNRSCP commitment to protect ecosystems, 

we present our performance across waste management, 

chemicals use and effluent quality. Reducing our negative 

environmental impact across terrestrial and aquatic resources 

are of paramount importance. For waste management, we 

report our waste generation and recycling quantities. For 

chemicals use, we report on our consumption intensity with 

the long-term aim of consuming less chemicals per mT of 

natural rubber produced. On effluent quality, we report on our 

performance across the Group. 

Rubber processing generates significant volumes of waste 

particularly from wastewater treatment. Sludge, a by-product 

of wastewater activity, contributes 65% to 70% of total waste 

by mass. Classified as non-hazardous, sludge possesses 

soil composting potential due to its organic matter content. 

Thus, it is a practice across our sites to have the sludge used 

by local smallholders for their farming requirements. Other 

non-hazardous waste sources come from physical impurities 

removed from raw material during the cleaning process. 

Impurities include forest debris, soil, plastic and metal bits. 

Typical recycled items include packaging waste, paper and 

metals. Hazardous waste is generated from spent chemicals, 

used chemical containers, oils, oily rags and lubricants. Our 

sites collect these and store them appropriately before being 

sent to licensed hazardous waste collectors and treatment 

facilities. 

Our performance on waste management is mixed over a two-

year period10. We observed an increase in hazardous waste and 

sludge while a decrease was reported in non-hazardous waste 

in 2019. Sludge reuse is fairly constant across the two years. 

Our waste recycling performance unfortunately decreased in 

2019. Guided by our SNRSCP commitments and Group EHS 

plan, we will strive to reduce waste and increase reuse and 

recycling efforts across our operations.

Chemicals Use

The chart above illustrates our use of chemicals and their 

consumption intensities across processing and plantation 

activities in 2019. For plantations, we use mainly solid state 

fertilisers, while fungicides, herbicides and pesticides are 

primarily in liquid form for application across our estates. 

For our processing sites, both solid and liquid chemicals are 

used in the production of crumb rubber and latex concentrate. 

Ammonia, formic acid and Deorub solutions represent most 

of the liquid chemicals used. Ammonia is used for latex 

preservation while formic acid aids in latex coagulation. 

Deorub application helps to mitigate odour in processing sites. 

Hydrated lime, hydroxylamine sulphate and caustic soda are 

the largest contributors to chemicals use in solid form at our 

processing sites. Hydrated lime prevents processed rubber 

sheets from sticking together. Hydroxylamine sulphate is use 

for latex grades requiring constant viscosity while caustic soda 

application helps to remove contamination from moving parts 

in contact with latex raw material. 

We aim to improve our consumption intensity over time in line 

with our commitment to our SNRSCP.

Effluent Quality

During the course of 2019, we experienced a setback in 

effluent quality standards at our Cameroonian and Ivory Coast 

operations. Due to positive historical compliance records in 

Africa, we chose to postpone previously planned desludging 

works and capital expenditure in response to the challenging 

market conditions. Unfortunately, the result of this was more 

significant than anticipated.

Remedial measures have since been taken by our local teams in 

conjunction with local government authorities. In the Ivory Coast, 

we have commenced major desludging works in early 2020. 

Additionally, we are installing a new Activated Sludge System 

with wastewater recycling capability in Cameroon, which will 

be operational before the end of 2020. These initiatives are 

in motion at the time of publishing this report and we expect 

to be in full compliance with local environmental regulations 

before the end of 2020.


CERTIFICATIONS AND STANDARDS

HALCYON AGRI - 2019 CORPORATE REPORT

[aggregate] [innovate] [sustain]

81

In support of our mission statement to develop a world-

class organisation serving the rubber industry, we adhere to 

various international certifications and standards across our 

plantations, processing and distribution assets. A significant 

number of our sites are certified against quality (ISO9001), 

environmental management (ISO14001), occupational health 

and safety (OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001) frameworks as well as 

specific certifications such as ISO 17025. Our processing sites 

are also HeveaPRO-certified, covering the pillars on Quality, 

Environment, Health and Safety (EHS), Supply Chain Security 

and Social Responsibility. 

We discontinued the use of Silver, Gold and Platinum rating 

system as we found it minimally effective in driving continuous 

improvement. For instance, many factories were found to be 

content with their Silver &amp; Gold ratings and lacked motivation 

to obtain Platinum rating. To address this, we transited towards 

focusing on raw HeveaPRO audit scores to benchmark 

processing facilities. Through this, we hope to drive our 

processing factories toward the highest HeveaPRO scores 

possible. As a group, we remain committed to continuous 

improvement and best-in-class operations through our various 

international standards and certifications.
