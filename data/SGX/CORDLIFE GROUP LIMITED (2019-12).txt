MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

Guided by the GRI Standards’ Materiality Principle, we conducted a materiality assessment to identify 

and prioritise the material ESG factors that are significant to our business and key stakeholders. We have 

taken a three-step approach to the materiality assessment process, as shown below:

The following sources were considered in the process of identifying potential material ESG factors:

• ESG issues and trends pertinent to healthcare industry

• ESG issues and concerns as identified by our peers

• Risks that most affect our operations and success

A total of 10 material ESG factors have been identified from the assessment, which have been reviewed 

and approved by the Board.

We will continue to review the list of material ESG factors annually to ensure their pertinence and 

priority to our business and our key stakeholders.

Economic 

Performance 1

As a listed company, we strive to maximise the wealth of 

our shareholders. It is critical to ensure the growth of our 

economic performance and our economic sustainability.

• GRI 201: Economic 

Performance 2016

Compliance 

with Laws and 

Regulations

Healthcare is a heavily regulated industry. It is essential 

for us to comply with all relevant laws and regulations to 

maintain our licence to operate.

• GRI 419: Socioeconomic 

Compliance 2016

Security of 

Storage Facilities

We are responsible for storing our customers’ cord blood 

and cord lining for an extended period of time. We are 

committed to protecting our storage facilities to ensure 

the availability of the cord blood and cord lining when 

needed in the future.

Product Quality 

and Reliability

The quality and viability of the cord blood and cord lining 

when used, could directly impact our customers’ health. 

It is critical to protect the quality of the cord blood and 

cord lining collected, processed and stored.

• Not applicable

(non-GRI topic)

Customer Privacy

We have access to sensitive personal information of 

our customers, including medical records, personal 

identification information, and genetic and biological

BEING THE ONE

RIGHT CHOICE

As a pioneer in private cord blood banking in Asia, we are 

committed to being the one right choice for our customers 

because they have only one chance to preserve their 

babies’ cord blood and cord lining. We uphold the utmost 

standards for compliance with laws and regulations, 

management of our operations and facilities, and we adopt 

a forward-looking approach to understanding our markets 

in order to continue to be the dependable choice for our 

customers.  

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS 

All of our policies and guidelines are developed and 

constantly being enhanced to comply with the relevant 

regulations. As a clinical laboratory licensed under the 

Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics (“PHMC”) Act by 

the Ministry of Health Singapore (“MOH”), all standard 

operating procedures (“SOPs”) for our work activities are 

in strict adherence to the code of standards as stipulated 

in the Act. Our Human Resources (“HR”) policies, including 

our Employee Handbook, are prepared in accordance with 

the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) Employment Act.

All our employees must adhere to company policies and 

guidelines and conduct business responsibly. Our Code 

of Conduct stipulates behaviours expected from our 

employees. Induction and on-the-job trainings related to 

regulations are conducted for all new employees upon 

commencement of their employment. A Whistleblowing 

Policy has also been put in place to provide well-defined 

and accessible channels for employees to raise concerns on 

matters relating to incident of improper conduct. 

We review our SOPs and related documents as well as 

conduct internal audits on critical business functions 

such as laboratory and operations systematically every 

year, to ensure strict adherence to the latest regulatory 

requirements. We also conduct quarterly quality training 

to keep our employees updated on the latest regulatory 

requirements.

Any deviations from the stipulated processes and 

regulatory standards are captured in our Corrective and 

Preventive Action (“CAPA”) system, which serves as a 

centralised monitoring and recording platform to ensure 

that responsibilities and tasks are assigned to the relevant 

cross-functional team of process owners involved. Through 

our CAPA process, root cause analysis is performed and the 

final action plan is documented, executed and verified to 

prevent recurrence of the non-conforming issues. 

We have migrated our CAPA system online to facilitate 

continuous monitoring and automation of the entire 

CAPA process so that our team can address issues in 

real-time. As operational excellence can help to reduce 

administrative and operational costs, information recorded 

in our CAPA system also serves as operational intelligence. 

This real-time monitoring of non-conformances allows us 

to implement additional preventive actions efficiently to 

reduce compliance issues and streamline work flows for 

better operational efficiency throughout our facilities. 

We have successfully attained the clinical laboratory licence 

renewal from MOH on January 2019 after going through a 

rigorous on-site inspection by MOH auditors in FY2018. 

At the end of the inspection, we were determined to be in 

full compliance with the regulations under the PHMC Act.

BEING THE ONE

RIGHT CHOICE

Patient safety is of utmost importance to us as our customers 

may need to use their stored cord blood and/or cord lining 

for medical treatment in the future. Therefore, we are 

committed to putting quality measures in place to safeguard 

our customers’ cord blood and cord lining under our care until 

the unit is released for transplantation or infusion. 

We adhere to internationally recognised best practices and 

stringent protocols. We also undergo voluntary accreditation 

by AABB and FACT, two of the leading international 

authoritative bodies that accredit organisations in the 

field of cellular therapy and transfusion medicine. These 

accreditations are testament to our unwavering commitment 

to quality. All of our policies and procedures, especially SOPs 

for critical operations of collection, processing, storage and 

release of cord blood, are in compliance with the standards 

set by these accreditation bodies. Our SOPs are reviewed 

and updated regularly to ensure continued compliance with 

the latest regulatory standards, accreditation standards and 

industry best practices. We have also conducted quarterly 

quality training in FY2019 to keep our employees updated on 

any changes in our processes, policies or controls, relating to 

regulatory or standard changes.

We 

take 

our 

commitment 

to 

safeguard 

our 

customers’ 

cord 

blood and cord lining very seriously 

to uphold the trust our customers 

have placed in us. Our storage 

facility at A’Posh Bizhub has passed 

stringent 

audits 

conducted 

by 

2 Formerly known as American Association of Blood Banks, AABB is an 

international, 

not-for-profit 

association 

representing 

individuals 

and 

organisations involved in transfusion and cell transplantation medicine. 

3 The Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT), also a non-

profit corporation, is the leader in international standards for cellular therapy, 

used in Europe, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

SECURITY OF STORAGE FACILITIES

PRODUCT QUALITY AND RELIABILITY

MOH, AABB2 and FACT3. Our laboratory is equipped with 

fire retardant walls and multiple backup systems to ensure 

uninterrupted operation at all times. Our storage tanks are 

designed to maintain optimal cryogenic storage temperatures 

for cell storage over long periods. 

Access to the laboratory and storage area is strictly controlled. 

Our Quality Manual for Safety and Facility Management and 

relevant SOPs dictate access restriction for specific areas of our 

facility. Each of our employee’s scope of access is determined 

by their roles in the company, and the access system is 

updated immediately whenever there are movements in 

staff. The access authorisation list is also reviewed annually. 

Our storage tanks are monitored 24 hours a day year-round 

and are inspected on a monthly basis. Our laboratory and 

storage area is also installed with new CCTV to reinforce our 

monitoring efforts.

We have established laboratory SOPs and disaster recovery 

plans to ensure the security of our customers’ biological 

samples in the event of an emergency or disaster. All 

departments are required to create their respective disaster 

recovery plan for all identified disaster scenarios with varying 

levels of severity. Briefings of disaster recovery plans are 

conducted for all new staff with respect to their scope of 

work and responsibility. We also conduct disaster recovery 

simulation testings annually to evaluate the robustness of the 

disaster recovery plans and our effectiveness in managing the 

simulated disaster scenarios.

BEING THE ONE

RIGHT CHOICE

Shift in demographic trends, such as stagnant or decreasing 

birth rates, not only affects demand for our products and 

services, but also indicate potential shift in our customers’ 

needs. As such, we monitor demographic trends of our 

operational locations proactively through our risk management 

process to anticipate how we can better serve our customers 

to meet their needs. 

We assess and review our risk matrix for key risks annually. 

Demographic shift is one of the risks assessed and monitored. 

Our account managers collect and review birth rate data on a 

monthly basis, and our market intelligence team collates and 

monitors demographic data and intelligence on a quarterly 

basis. Trends and shifts in birth rate and demographic structure 

are reviewed and discussed to gain insights into potential shift 

in market, which serve as basis for us to adjust our strategies 

and tactics in approaching the market. Our corporate team 

leverages these trends to identify suitable healthcare products 

and services that can add value to the customers. 

As external stakeholders play a key role in executing part of 

our critical operations, we have established SOPs to ensure 

the same level of quality is being upheld. For instance, we have 

created SOPs that define trainings required for healthcare 

professionals, as they are responsible for the collection of cord 

blood, cord lining and maternal blood samples. Regular training 

is provided for these healthcare professionals at the hospitals 

to reinforce their understanding and knowledge of their 

responsibilities during the collection of cord blood and cord 

lining samples. We continually monitor the competency level 

and performance of healthcare professionals to determine if 

re-training is necessary. We also conduct training annually for 

nursing staff and caregivers at all our collaborating hospitals.

We have developed a supplier management SOP that defines 

the procedure to qualify, review and select suppliers as to 

ensure that we only work with qualified and reliable vendors. 

Stricter qualification requirements are applied to critical 

suppliers, as they supply materials that can directly affect 

the quality of our products or services or are used in our 

laboratory. Supplier reviews are performed annually to ensure 

our master list of approved suppliers is up-to-date and they 

continue to meet our standards.

As we believe all departments play a part in upholding 

product and service quality, they are required to establish 

their respective quality objectives for the financial year. 

Performance against quality objectives are tracked in 

monthly quality report and discussed at the monthly quality 

meeting. Quality-related issues or any deviations from SOPs 

are recorded in the CAPA system to ensure corrective and 

preventive actions are implemented accordingly.

CARING FOR OUR

CUSTOMERS

Our customers entrust us with sensitive personal 

information and we are committed to protecting their 

privacy. We have established a Privacy Policy in accordance 

with the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”). 

The Policy outlines how we collect, store, use, transfer, and 

manage our customers’ personal data 4.  All our contracts 

and lead acquisition programmes contain confidentiality 

terms to assure customers and prospects that their 

personal information is safeguarded. To ensure that our 

employees and our business partners uphold the same 

standards, we have included confidentiality obligations 

in employment contracts for our employees and service 

agreements for suppliers and third-party service providers. 

In tandem with our policy and guidelines for customer 

privacy, we regularly monitor internal access to personal 

information and the effectiveness of our Information 

Technology (“IT”) system in protecting the personal data 

that we possess. We designate and restrict user access 

roles for our employees, which are reviewed annually, to 

mitigate the risk of excessive data access. We conduct 

IT general control (“ITGC”) audits annually to verify the 

integrity of the data and processes that our IT system 

supports. Our security software undergoes patch 

management monthly to address any vulnerabilities that 

could be exploited by hackers. The security of our servers 

is also reviewed regularly to ensure no breach of data.

2019 PERFORMANCE

• Achieved zero formal 

claims by customers 

concerning breaches of 

customer privacy and 

loss of customer data

2019 TARGET

• Zero formal claims by 

customers concerning 

breaches of customer 

privacy and loss of 

customer data

2020 TARGET

• Zero formal claims by 

customers concerning 

breaches of customer 

privacy and loss of

In FY2019, we carried out an in-house cyber security audit 

to identify and patch potential security vulnerabilities. A 

phishing awareness testing and training was also performed 

to help our employees recognise and report phishing 

attempts. Various audit and test checks were performed, 

including configuration review for our operating system, 

database, and network firewall, penetration tests for our 

web application and network as well as an email phishing 

exercise. The findings showed that our risk ratings were 

either low or medium, all of which have since been 

addressed with hardening policies. We also provide 

periodic phishing awareness training for our employees to 

enhance our security awareness. 

Furthermore, we conduct regular trainings on data 

protection, security awareness and risk management to 

ensure our employees understand relevant guidelines 

and impart good practices for handling personal data. 

In FY2019, we conducted a training on PDPA for all the 

heads of departments (“HODs”). Following which, the 

HODs collectively mapped out the PDPA guidelines and 

conducted a company-wide training to all the employees 

for adherence.

To capture feedback related to data confidentiality, we 

have designated a Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) for our 

customers to reach out to. All complaints and incidents 

related to customer privacy breach will be logged into our 

CAPA system to ensure corrective and preventive actions 

are carried out to prevent similar incidents from recurring.   

Our mission as a consumer healthcare group is to provide reliable healthcare solutions through innovation, 

technological advancement and commitment to quality. We value the trust that our customers have placed in us, 

and we care for our customers by protecting their personal data, continuously engaging them, and keeping them 

informed on stem cell utility development.

CARING FOR

OUR CUSTOMERS

At Cordlife, customer satisfaction is regularly evaluated and monitored 

at several operational stages and customer touchpoints to ensure that 

we are meeting the needs of our customers. External stakeholders, 

including healthcare professionals are also surveyed regularly to 

assess their satisfaction level with various aspects of our operations. 

We implement a suite of satisfaction surveys to gather feedback 

from our key stakeholder groups, including customers and business 

partners. These surveys seek to acquire a better understanding of the 

perception and service journey of our stakeholders so that we can 

improve our service standards accordingly. 

The results of the customer satisfaction surveys are reviewed at the 

monthly customer-centric meeting. All departments in direct contact 

with customers and external stakeholders are required to set and meet 

the respective Customer Delight Index (“CDI”) metrics and targets, 

which include target rating for the customer satisfaction surveys. 

Additionally, customer feedback and complaints are reviewed at the 

meeting to identify potential areas for improvement. Going forward, 

we will continue to leverage the monthly customer-centric meeting to 

conduct regular customer-centricity training sessions for the customer 

management department in FY2020. 

Other than establishing various customer feedback channels, we also 

conduct customer nurturing initiatives to engage and strengthen 

our relationship with customers. These initiatives include offering 

discounted paediatric vision screening, sending birthday cards and 

birthday vouchers as well as furnishing educational materials and 

updates every quarter.

CARING FOR

OUR CUSTOMERS

Enhancing awareness and understanding of stem cell applications is one key way we engage with and care for our 

customers. We believe in keeping our prospective and existing customers informed so that they are aware of the 

potential treatments, which might be useful for them or their loved ones. 

We provide regular updates on stem cell applications to our prospective and existing customers through the following 

channels:

 

• Weekly updates on cord blood banking related news and Cordlife services via digital platforms

• Quarterly updates on stem cell utility development and relevant industry news

• Events and seminars 

In FY2019, we held 44 events and seminars with our hospital and event partners to raise public awareness about the 

benefits of stem cell banking and other related Cordlife services. We continued to forge strategic partnerships with 

corporate entities by organising talks to introduce Cordlife services and offer corporate rates to their employees.

Furthermore, we engage with healthcare professionals through various initiatives to keep them abreast on the latest 

developments relevant to the products and services they are working with:

• Regular stem cell related topics for hospital staff

• Regular updates and detailing aids on latest white papers for doctors

• Annual or semi-annual medical education consisting of educational talks on topics related to stem cell utility or related 

Cordlife services for doctors

• Partnerships with hospital caregivers and medical institutions to conduct clinical trials to increase the applications of 

stem cells

We also hold similar educational talks and trainings within our company to keep our employees updated.

All of our external engagement activities are monitored for their effectiveness in key message delivery and reach to our 

targeted stakeholders. Digital outreach activities are evaluated by reports on prospect return rates. Our marketing and 

marketing intelligence departments tabulate prospect and lead surveys and analyse survey responses. We also obtain 

feedback from hospital caregivers regarding the educational initiatives we have provided. These results are discussed at 

our weekly taskforce meeting to help fine-tune our approach and tactics to further promote the awareness of stem cell 

banking.

CARING FOR OUR

EMPLOYEES

Our employees are the foundation of our business. We uphold the highest standards in ensuring that they are adequately 

trained and have a safe environment to work in.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

To ensure a safe working environment for our employees, especially our laboratory personnel, we have established 

policies and SOPs to manage occupational risks and safety. As stipulated in our Employee Handbook, we require all 

laboratory personnel to be vaccinated for Hepatitis B before they are allowed to work in the laboratory. Our Safety 

Manual encompasses the safety aspect of laboratory operations. We also have SOPs that stipulate the safety measures 

for specific work procedures, such as the handling of liquid nitrogen and any spillage, as well as the relevant first aid 

measures.

Our Safety Committee oversees and regularly reviews risk assessments and safety-related issues, and updates the 

Safety Manual as necessary. Our risk assessment team and safety team are responsible for the implementation of risk 

assessments and safety exercises. In FY2019, we diligently conducted an internal risk assessment even though the risk 

assessment was only due in FY2020 as per MOM requirement for companies to review risk management exercise once 

every three years.

Safety incidents are reported in the monthly quality meeting for review and logged into our CAPA system to ensure that 

corrective and preventive actions are implemented. Additionally, any cases of needle prick incidents are to be reported 

to MOM accordingly, and follow-up checks as well as medical reviews are to be performed.

Other than putting relevant governance mechanisms and policies in place, we also conduct trainings to prevent accidents 

from occurring. Risk assessment plans and safety instructions from our building management are introduced to all 

employees during induction training. All trainings completed are recorded, reviewed and endorsed by the respective 

heads of departments. Laboratory personnel are trained on the safety aspects of their work during on-the-job training, 

which are recorded and reviewed. In FY2019, we have also conducted relevant safety courses for our safety team, 

including first aid courses to equip them with the skills to deal with emergency situations, and risk assessment training to 

help them identify hazards, evaluate risks and implement appropriate risk control measures in our day-to-day operational 

activities. We will continue to conduct relevant safety courses for new members of the Safety Committee in the coming 

year.

FY2020, we aim to maintain the record of zero health and safety incidents at our workplace.

CARING FOR THE

ENVIRONMENT

We are mindful of the environmental impact of our business and we are committed to doing our part by reducing our 

GHG emissions.

EMISSIONS

Energy supply is key to our business continuity. We work to ensure that our operations are energy efficient and resilient 

to outages. As such, our Code of Conduct requires all employees to participate in environmental conservation, and that 

all facilities as well as equipment are used in the most energy efficient manner.

We conduct regular and timely maintenance for all our equipment, laboratories and electrical facilities to ensure that 

they are in optimal working condition and continue to be energy efficient. We also monitor our facilities’ electricity 

consumption on a monthly basis to identify abnormal spikes or increase in usage trends, so that we can analyse, 

investigate and remediate any possible inefficient use of energy.

FY2019 PERFORMANCE

To continue our efforts in reducing energy consumption, we aim to progressively replace all fluorescent lights to energy-

saving LED lights for our offices and facilities in Singapore, and implement regular energy-saving awareness initiatives 

to inform and engage our employees.

10 Diesel consumption is computed based on the amount of diesel consumed by our emergency generator during its 10-minute annual maintenance 

exercise. During the annual maintenance, the generator runs at 100% Prime Running Power (PRP) setting, which consumes 0.377 litre of diesel per 

minute.

11 Conversion factor to kWh is derived from 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

12 GHG emissions for diesel consumption are computed based on emission factor derived from 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse

Gas Inventories and GHG emissions for electricity consumption are computed based on electricity grid emission factor published in Singapore Energy 

Statistics 2018.
