STATEMENT

FROM OUR BOARD

Dear stakeholders,

The Board and Management are pleased to present Chuan Hup Holdings Limited (“Chuan Hup”, the 

“Company” or the “Group”)’s second Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 30 June 2019 

(“FY2019”). This report reaffirms Chuan Hup’s commitment towards incorporating Environmental, Social 

and Governance (ESG) considerations in our business activities and discloses the management approach 

towards our material ESG matters, as well as its performance for the reporting year.

In FY2019, the Board and Management have reviewed the ESG factors identified in Chuan Hup’s inaugural 

sustainability report and determined them to still be relevant to achieving the sustainability goals of our 

business. Moving forward, the Board will continue to closely monitor for new developments that may 

affect the long-term sustainability of Chuan Hup. We are grateful to all stakeholders who have supported 

us over the years. This sustainability journey we are on takes unremitting effort and we look forward to 

your continued support.

ABOUT

THE REPORT

This is Chuan Hup’s second Sustainability Report, prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 

2016 Standards – “Core” reporting requirements. To be in line with the latest GRI standards, we transitioned 

from GRI 2016 to GRI 2018 on the applicable ESG topic. This report details our approach in managing material 

sustainability matters identified as part of the Group’s operations for the period of 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019 

(“FY2019”) on an annual reporting cycle. Where applicable, one year of historical performance data has been 

included for comparative purposes.

The scope of this report covers the sustainability performance of Chuan Hup’s investment holding business, and 

performance relating to issues from Chuan Hup’s operations. As Chuan Hup itself is not an operating company, 

the report does not consider issues which may be relevant for investee companies at their local operations or 

subsidiaries.

While we have not sought external assurance for this report, we will work towards doing so as our reporting 

matures over time. We welcome feedback from all stakeholders on our Sustainability Report. For any queries or 

comments on this report, please contact corpsec_legal@chuanhup.com.sg.

ABOUT 

CHUAN HUP

Founded in 1970, Chuan Hup Holdings Limited (“Chuan Hup”) has grown into an investment company with a 

diversified portfolio of strategic investments, including property sectors. The Company also engages in quality 

equity investments aimed at generating long-term returns. Chuan Hup began as a tug and barge service provider 

to PSA Corporation in Singapore, establishing a reputation as one of the leading owners and operators of marine 

transportation equipment to the resource industry. Following its listing on the Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange 

Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) in 1983, the Company diversified its business footprint to include property 

development and electronics manufacturing services under PCI Limited (“PCI”).

There were significant changes to Chuan Hup’s portfolio in 2019 as Chuan Hup has disposed of all of its shares 

in PCI by way of a scheme of arrangement, which became effective and binding in accordance with its terms on 

29 April 2019. In the same period, Chuan Hup also acquired the entire 24th floor of The Central, Singapore which 

houses several office units. More details about our portfolio can be found in our Annual Report 2019. This change 

in portfolio does not affect the reporting scope as this report covers the sustainability performance of Chuan Hup’s 

investment holding business, and performance relating to issues from Chuan Hup operations.

With a focus on delivering long-term sustainable growth, Chuan Hup continues to explore investment opportunities 

with prudence to further augment its portfolios and generate sustainable value for its stakeholders.

Chuan Hup understands the importance of expanding our business responsibly and sustainably. At Chuan Hup, the 

Board of Directors is directly responsible for reviewing and overseeing the management and monitoring of ESG 

issues. The Board and Management work together with our stakeholders to ensure that all relevant ESG matters 

are considered during the formulation of our business strategy.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

To identify issues that impact our mission and external stakeholders the most, we conducted our first materiality 

assessment in May 2018 as summarised in Figure 1. In FY2019, the management has reviewed the material matters 

identified in our inaugural report and determined that they are still relevant to Chuan Hup. These four material 

matters and one additional reporting matter are summarised in Figure 2. Moving forward, Chuan Hup will continue 

to monitor these material matters to ensure that they remain relevant and material.

OUR

GOVERNANCE

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, BUSINESS ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE TO LAWS

Chuan Hup is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and business conduct to safeguard 

the interests of its stakeholders. We firmly believe that sound corporate governance and business ethics are 

essential to the sustainability of the Company’s business and performance. Chuan Hup’s Board of Directors is 

directly responsible for the implementation and management of policies and practices on corporate governance.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES

At Chuan Hup, all employees are required to adhere to our Corporate Governance policies and practices, summarised 

in Table 1 below. In addition to these policies, we require all employees to comply with all relevant laws and 

regulations in Singapore. To maintain compliance, all employees are required to submit an annual declaration of 

non-conflict interest with the Company’s business.

Table 1. Summary of Chuan Hup’s Corporate Governance Policies

Policies/Practices

Description

Policy on Work Ethics

All employees are expected to adhere to a high standard of personal conduct at 

all times and not to engage in any activities or interests that conflict with any of 

the Group’s business.

Whistleblowing Policy

The policy serves to encourage and provide a channel to employees of the 

Company and any other persons to report in good faith and in confidence, 

without fear of reprisals, concerns about possible wrongdoing, or breach of 

applicable laws, regulations, policies or other matters.

Internal Code on Dealing 

in Securities

Chuan Hup’s internal code on securities trading sets out the implications of 

insider trading and provides guidance and internal regulation on dealings in the 

Company’s securities by its Directors and employees.

In addition to these policies and practices, internal and external audits are conducted regularly to review company 

policies and practices. The Management also obtains feedback from all stakeholders during Annual General Meetings 

and Extraordinary General Meetings to enhance and improve the Company’s business operations. Also, to ensure 

alignment with all regulatory requirements, the Directors and Senior Management have attended seminars on 

changes to the Code of Corporate Governance and SGX Listing Rules.

More detailed corporate governance practices are set out in our Corporate Governance Report, found from pages 

25 to 37 of Chuan Hup’s 2019 Annual Report, with specific reference to the principles of the Code of Corporate 

Governance 2012.

TARGETS AND PERFORMANCE

INFORMATION SECURITY AND PRIVACY

With the shift towards a digital economy, it has become increasingly important for us to protect the data and 

privacy of the organisation and our stakeholders. Having a robust information security system performs four 

vital functions for our organisation – protect the organisation’s ability to function, enable the safe operation of 

applications implemented on the organisation’s IT systems, protect the data the organisation collects and uses, 

and safeguards the technology assets in use at the organisation. We recognise that any breaches to our security 

systems can harm the accuracy, integrity and completeness of data and information provided to our business 

partners and stakeholders.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES

At Chuan Hup, we have implemented a three-pronged approach to address the issue of information security as 

summarised in Figure 4. First, we are focused on the implementation of the latest technology and best practices 

to ensure that our data remains safe. We have implemented next-generation firewalls and signatures to protect our 

staff’s web access, further ensuring that our systems are always installed with up-to-date anti-malware software. 

Also, we have implemented a corporate-wide password policy which will prompt employees to change their 

passwords every 3 months.

In addition to implementing IT security systems, we also communicate with our staff to ensure that they comply 

with all the necessary best practices to ensure that there is no weak link to our security system. This communication 

is done through the employee manual, Chuan Hup’s House Rules Policy, and email circulars.

Finally, we constantly monitor for malicious activities within our server and conduct monthly server maintenance 

to ensure that the system is kept up to date against any new threats that may compromise our systems.

OUR

PEOPLE

HEALTH AND SAFETY

At Chuan Hup, we are committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for all our employees. As our 

activities are centred around our people, we understand the importance of managing employee health and safety 

to our bottom-line. This involves the maintenance of good working conditions and ensuring workers are protected 

from risks.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES

Our policies and practices concerning health and safety are focused on three different aspects – workplace safety, 

employee health, and employee well-being – as seen in Figure 6.

Managing occupational health and safety

In the aspect of workplace safety, Chuan Hup has several policies to account for all possible types of hazards that 

an employee might face at the workplace. Overall, the primary policy for safety is listed in our ‘House Rules’ policy. 

This policy mandates that all employees adhere to all safety regulations and practices that have been put in place 

by the ‘Building Management Office’ of the building in which we operate.

To further reinforce a culture of safety, we provide timely updates to all employees on matters on workplace 

safety information and instructions. In addition, management provides a feedback mechanism to allow employees 

to report any workplace hazards.

Promotion of employee health and well-being

We also place significant emphasis on promoting employee health. Annually, we engage medical consultants to 

conduct health screenings for all employees. To further assist our employees’ access to healthcare, all employees at 

Chuan Hup are also covered by a Group Hospital and Surgical (H&amp;S) Insurance Plan until their employment contract 

ceases or when the employee reaches 65 years of age. Finally, Chuan Hup provides employees time-off with pay 

to allow our employees to maintain their health, morale and efficiency at the workplace.

OUR

PEOPLE

Recognising that the mental health and well-being of our employees is just as important as their physical health, 

we aim to provide a workplace environment free from harassment. In the rare case that harassment does occur, 

employees are able to escalate the matters to the HR department who would mediate and amicably solve any 

conflicts within the workplace. In addition, Chuan Hup also engages experts to conduct team-building and bonding 

activities for our employees. These activities provide an avenue for our employees to improve their ability to 

communicate and cooperate with fellow employees in a stress-free manner.

TARGETS AND PERFORMANCE

In FY2019, we have upheld our commitment towards providing a safe and healthy working environment for our 

employees. There were no reports of work-related fatalities, high consequence injuries4, injuries5, or work-related 

ill health cases6. The increase in the total hours worked was the result of an increase in the number of employees 

at Chuan Hup between FY2018 and FY2019.

employees to take part in this health screening.

TALENT MANAGEMENT

Talent management plays an important role in the business strategy since it manages one of the important assets 

of the Company – its people. Chuan Hup is committed to hire, manage, develop, and retain talented and excellent 

employees in the Company. We take the effort to effectively manage employees to help them develop their skills 

and capabilities, helping to improve the Company’s business performance.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES

Our approach to employee development and management is anchored by our Learning and Development Policy. This 

policy encourages our employees to take ownership of self-development and learning as a means to continuously 

upgrade and upskill oneself to remain relevant. Through this policy, Chuan Hup provides for employees who wish 

to pursue academic and professional development programmes.

TARGETS AND PERFORMANCE

In FY2019, our employees at all levels participated in both internal training conducted by Chuan Hup as well as 

external training conducted by vendors. In total, Chuan Hup employees underwent around 310 hours of training. 

The breakdown of these training by gender and employee category is provided in Figure 7.

PEOPLE

For internal training, a great deal of focus was placed on teaching new employees their roles and responsibilities. 

Through our employee induction programme, more senior staff or outgoing staff are given the opportunity to educate 

new employees on the details of the work, thus preserving organisational knowledge. For external training, focus 

is placed on skills related to IT, HR and Finance functions of the Company. Through such training, employees are 

kept abreast on new regulations and best practices within the industry. A summary of the training programmes 

that our employees underwent in FY2019 is provided in Table 3 below.

reviews may include performance or career development evaluations and are in place to ensure the continued 

career success of our employees. In FY2019, 100% of our employees were provided with performance reviews.

Moving forward, we intend to increase the average training hours of our employees by 20% in the coming Financial 

Year.
