City Developments Limited (CDL) has published its Integrated Sustainability Report (ISR) 2022, 

its fifteenth sustainability report since 2008. Themed “Zero in on Future Value”, the digital report 

communicates CDL’s progress towards its material Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 

goals and targets under the CDL Future Value 2030 Sustainability Blueprint. Aligned with global 

climate goals, including the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the blueprint remains 

integrated into the company’s business strategies and operations.  

 

In the year under review (1 January to 31 December 2021), CDL achieved a 42% reduction in 

carbon emissions intensity from base-year 2007, meeting its interim 2021 target and is on track to 

achieving its Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi)-validated target of a 59% reduction by 2030. 

From 2012 to 2021, CDL reported energy savings of over S$34 million from energy-efficient 

retrofitting and initiatives across all its commercial buildings. 

 

Mr Sherman Kwek, CDL Group Chief Executive Officer, said, “Sustainability has become 

mainstream on political and business agendas, with rising expectations for companies to step up 

ESG integration into their businesses and set clear decarbonisation pathways. As one of 

Singapore’s pioneers in real estate and green buildings, we have been proactively aligning our 

business with global and national goals to mitigate the negative impact of climate change. With 

CDL’s Future Value 2030 Sustainability Blueprint established in 2017 as the bedrock of our ESG 

goals and strategies, we have a clear carbon-reduction action plan that positions us well towards 

our net zero goals. Contributing to a sustainable future and embracing a triple bottom line approach 

will remain integral to our business.” 

 

Blended Reporting Framework and Robust External Assurance  

 

Over the years, CDL’s robust sustainability reporting has evolved into a unique blended model 

using GRI Standards as its core since 2008. Providing comprehensive disclosures ahead of 

growing and diverse expectations, CDL embraced CDP since 2010, Global Real Estate 

Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) since 2013, Value Reporting Foundation (VRF)’s Integrated 

Reporting Framework since 2015, Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Reporting since 2016, 

Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework since 2017, Sustainability 

Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards for Real Estate Sector since 2020 and Climate 

Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) since 2021.

CDL’s sustainability reports have been externally assured since 2009, and the scope of assurance 

was expanded to cover SASB and CDSB in ISR 2021. This year, the company is proud to have 

raised its assurance level for GRI and SASB Standards to reasonable assurance and also became 

the first Singapore company to externally assure its TCFD framework. 

 

Decarbonising and Innovating towards a Net Zero Future  

 

In 2021, CDL raised its carbon emissions reduction targets and commitments, which includes 

targets validated by the SBTi, under which CDL will reduce its Scope 1 and 2 Green House Gas 

(GHG) emissions by 63% per square metre (sqm) leased area by 2030 from a 2016 base year. 

CDL will also reduce its Scope 31 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services by 41% per 

sqm Gross Floor Area (GFA) by 2030 from 2016. It will also reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG 

emissions from investments2 by 58.8% by 2030 from 2016, including hotels managed by CDL’s 

wholly-owned hotel subsidiary, Millennium &amp; Copthorne Hotels Limited (M&amp;C). 

 

In February 2021, CDL became the first real estate conglomerate in Southeast Asia to sign the 

WorldGBC Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment. This global pledge to achieve net zero 

operational carbon by 2030 covers new and existing wholly-owned assets under its direct 

management and operational control. At COP26 in November 2021, CDL joined 44 companies 

worldwide to extend its pledge towards a net zero whole life carbon emissions approach. CDL 

pledged to achieve maximum reduction in embodied carbon and compensate for residual 

operational and upfront embodied emissions via offsetting for new developments by 2030; and for 

all buildings to be net zero carbon by 2050.  

 

In the same month, CDL was the only Singapore real estate company amongst 19 companies 

invited to Climate Impact X’s pilot auction. It successfully secured high-quality carbon credits to 

offset greenhouse gas emissions from its operations. These credits, sourced from natural climate 

solutions, will be utilised over the next three years to offset an estimated 6% to 7% of emissions 

from its operations per year to complement CDL’s net zero targets. 

 

Leveraging Green Finance to Accelerate Low-Carbon Solutions 

 

Since issuing its first green bond in 2017, CDL has secured more than S$3 billion of sustainable 

finance, comprising a green bond, various green loans and a sustainability-linked loan. In April 

2021, its South Beach Consortium joint venture (JV) secured a five-year green loan totalling 

S$1.22 billion – one of Singapore’s largest green loans. In August 2021, CDL and its JV partner 

jointly secured green loans amounting to S$847 million to finance two upcoming developments in 

Singapore – integrated development Piccadilly Grand and Piccadilly Galleria at Northumberland 

Road and an Executive Condominium at Tengah Garden Walk. 

 

CDL’s ESG performance is widely recognised by leading global sustainability benchmarks. These 

include the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World by Corporate Knights, where 

CDL ranked fifth overall and maintained its position as the world’s most sustainable real estate 

company for the fourth consecutive year. Other notable accolades include maintaining double ‘A’s 

in the 2021 CDP Global A List for corporate climate action and water security. This makes CDL 

the only company in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong to score ‘A’ for corporate climate action for 

four consecutive years and water security for three consecutive years. CDL also maintained an 

‘AAA’ leader rating by MSCI ESG Research since 2010.    

 

In November last year, CDL was one of 45 global companies and the only Singapore company to 

be awarded the inaugural 2021 Terra Carta Seal by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales, 

 

1 SBTi only requires companies’ scope 3 targets to cover 66% of their scope 3 emissions. For CDL, category 1 

(purchased goods and services) and category 15 (investments) have reduction targets as these categories cover 

more than 80% of its scope 3 emissions.  

2 Investment refers to CDL’s six key subsidiaries: CBM Pte Ltd, CDL Hospitality Trusts, City Serviced Offices, Le 

Grove Serviced Residences, Tower Club Singapore, hotels owned and managed by M&amp;C.

through his Sustainable Markets Initiative. Presented during COP26 at Glasgow, the Seal 

recognises global companies driving innovation and demonstrating commitment to creating 

genuinely sustainable markets. 

 

For its efforts to effectively engage its supplier network to address climate change, CDL was the 

only real estate company in Southeast Asia and the only Singapore company to be recognised as 

a 2021 CDP Supplier Engagement Leader for the second consecutive year. This places CDL 

amongst the top 8% of companies assessed by CDP for supplier engagement on climate change.
