OUR LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS

OUR LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS 

Dear Stakeholders,  

Ever since the establishment of ES 

Group (Holdings) Limited and its 

subsidiaries in 1975, our vision and 

mission that have been instilled in 

us for over 40 years have brought us 

far, and even through tough times 

such as the recent downturn of the 

offshore and marine industry.  

The aftermath of the structural 

changes in the global oil and gas in-

dustry during 2015 and 2016 is still 

lingering, with players in the indus-

try continue to struggle for survival 

or recovery. Despite some signs of 

recovery in the offshore, marine and 

shipping industry, the operating 

conditions remain challenging. An 

uncertain global economy and in-

creased competition will continue 

to put pressure on the management 

of the Company. The Group will con-

tinue to stay prudent with on-going 

lean cost management efforts.  

We continue to reduce our head-

count from 650 employees in 2017 

to 460 in 2018 to obtain equilibrium 

with our workforce and the market 

demand. We have also in 2018 con-

tinue to expand further into the 

shipping segment where our ship-

ping segment now contributed 

23.7% of the Group’s revenue as 

compared to 19.2% in 2017.

Our core business in the new build-

ing and repair segment is still a sig-

nificant aspect of the Group’s oper-

ations and focus on the safety and 

performance of our workers re-

mains the paramount importance 

for 2018. We continue to maintain 

the level of commitment in safety 

and training, which is detailed in 

depth in this report. 

Shipping segment has now become 

a significant segment for reporting. 

We have further reported on how 

we do our part in maintaining our 

vessels in compliance with interna-

tional bodies as well as local law and 

regulations in protecting the envi-

ronment, particularly our planet’s 

beautiful seas that houses many 

thousands of marine species. 

Our voyage for sustainability contin-

ues after our inaugural Sustainabil-

ity Report for year 2017 that was 

published in November 2018. We 

first embark on our voyage with a 

brief description on our operations 

and how sustainable they are. Now 

we have structured this report to be 

in line with the Global Reporting In-

itiative 

Sustainability 

Reporting 

Standards so as to better convey our 

sustainability efforts to our stake-

holders. 

Similarly, the Group continue to ad-

here to the principles and guidelines 

of the Code of Corporate Govern-

ance 2012 issued by the Monetary 

Authority of Singapore (“MAS”). 

Further down on our voyage, we 

look to build on the identified sus-

tainability topics and the respective 

performance to integrate and relate 

each number and disclosure to what 

we do so as to further elevate the 

quality of this report, as well as the 

quality of our operation. 

We wish to progressively approach 

our stakeholders using an active ap-

proach to listen to their concerns in 

our sustainability efforts and ad-

dress them. We believe in the con-

tinuous collaboration with each of 

our stakeholders to ultimately cre-

ate a more sustainable operation. 

The close relation between our sus-

tainability efforts and our vision and 

mission is the key to constantly cre-

ate a sustainable operation in every 

aspect of our Group. 

Join us in our Voyage into Sustainability.

On Behalf of the Board of Directors

OUR STAKEHOLDERS 

Stakeholders of the Company (“Stake-

mation on our sustainability efforts and 

the relevant risks, impacts, and oppor-

tunities arising from the relevant sus-

tainability elements. Stakeholders in-

clude our shareholders, customers, sup-

pliers, government and employees, as 

detailed below.

We reach out to the Stakeholders by 

means of published documents on our 

website and on the Singapore Exchange 

(“SGX”) website.  

Stakeholders working within the Group 

correspond with us via whistle-blowing 

procedures or through their respective 

reporting lines, whereas Stakeholders 

outside the Group correspond with us 

via our contact details listed in our web-

site or under the section “Our Reporti-

ing Basis” of this report. The Group 

does not have an active engagement 

approach 

such 

as 

surveys 

and 

discussions group, as the Group is still in 

the 

process 

of 

maturing 

its 

Sustainability Report and its topics and 

factors (refer to the section “Our 

Sustainability Topics” of this report) 

before we are able to have a meaningful 

and fruitful engagement with our 

Stakeholders.

Shareholders 



As the provider of capital and owners of the Group, Shareholders play an important role in the control, financing, and 

governance of the Group’s business. Shareholders are concerned with the going concern of the Group and the maximisa-

tion of returns on the capital they have invested. The Group’s commitment to a sustainable operation is their utmost 

interest as we continue to strive for excellence in alignment of their interest.

Customers



In line with the Group’s Vision and Missions, we believe in customers’ satisfaction and excellence in quality, and they in 

return will be concerned with our sustainability towards upholding, or perhaps exceed, their expectation on the quality of 

our services and products. 

Suppliers



Strong and effective relationships with our suppliers give our business better strategic advantages, which includes access 

to resources, greater supplier support, and lower costs. Suppliers will be interested in our financial performance in terms 

of payment ability so as to decide on the continuance of our working relationship in the long run. 

Employees 



As a labour-intensive operation with a huge labour force, the Group focuses on human resource related policies (e.g. merit-

based and non-discriminatory recruitment; grievance procedures) and the safety of our employees, which are crucial fac-

tors for attracting and retaining the best employees, and employees’ motivation and commitment to the Company. 

Government



The relevant statutory boards of the Government will be interested in how we have imposed relevant internal controls and 

processes to ensure that all applicable laws and regulations have been adhered to.

heart of our operation and not deviat-

ing from that.  

Voyaging into Sustainability 

We have published our first Sustainabil-

ity Report (for the financial year ended 

31 December 2017) in November 2018, 

driven by the requirement of SGX Ca-

talist Rules, which marks our first em-

barkation to the road of sustainability. 

In 2019, our second publication (for 

the financial year ended 31 December 

2018) is about our on-going voyage 

into sustainability reporting, with key 

efforts to improve the quality of the 

report in terms of compliance (refer to 

the section “Our Reporting Basis” of 

this report for more information), 

depth, relevance, and understandabil-

ity.  

We believe that the driver for sustain-

ability must first start from a sound 

and effective Corporate Governance 

that propagates across each function 

of our Group, which we will detail fur-

ther below.

Management Approach 

The Group believes that it is important 

to establish good corporate governance 

within the Group as this provides the 

foundation for a well-managed and effi-

cient organisation. This can in turn sus-

tain good business performance and 

safeguard the interests of the Stake-

holders. The Board of Directors of the 

Company (the “Board” or the “Direc-

tors”) is committed to continually de-

velop and uphold high standards of cor-

porate governance, guided by the prin-

ciples and guidelines of the Singapore 

Code of Corporate Governance 2012 

(the “Code”) issued by the Monetary 

Authority of Singapore. A full detailed 

Corporate Governance Report can be 

found in the Annual Report 2018 pages 

12 to 38. 

Whistle-Blowing 

Whistle-blowing policies have been in 

place since 2010. The Group encour-

ages employees to report in good faith 

and in confidence, without fear of re-

prisals, concerns about possible impro-

prieties in financial reporting or other 

matters to the chairman of the Audit 

and Risk Committee. Reportable con-

ducts include, but are not limited to, 

fraud, corruption, illegality, safety viola-

tions, and serious misconduct that con-

travene the procedures set by the 

Group that may lead to losses for the 

Group. Losses can include financial 

losses, non-financial losses, and tarnish 

of reputation of the Group.  

Whistle-blowing policy and whistle-

blowing reports received (if any), will be 

assessed by the Audit and Risk Commit-

tee from time to time. 

No incident of reportable conducts oc-

curred during the financial year ended 

31 December 2018. We aspire to main-

tain this record for the next financial 

year.

Sustainability Management 

Sustainability matters are managed by 

the Compliance Committee (“Commit-

tee”). The Committee, was first set up 

in 2010 to implement and review the ef-

fectiveness of the compliance frame-

work of the Group with the SGX Catalist 

Rules, compliance with legislation and 

regulations imposed by the relevant au-

thorities, as well as the liaison with pro-

fessional advisors on all corporate doc-

uments and actions (e.g. announce-

ments, circulars, etc.). 

The Committee also spearheads and 

manages all sustainability management 

matters, align with the requirements 

imposed by the SGX Catalist Rules, 

which includes: 

 Setting the direction of the Group’s 

sustainability efforts. 

 Identifying 

and 

reviewing 

the 

sustainability factors. 

 Reporting the identified factors to the 

Board at least once annually. 

 Reporting identified factors to all 

Stakeholders 

via 

the 

published 

sustainability report. 

The Committee reports to the Audit and 

Risk Committee.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS

OUR SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS 

Our Assessment Processes 

Sustainability topics primarily revolve 

around our operational aspect of the 

businesses, and are inherent factors 

arising from within the Group. They are 

deemed material to either impact our 

businesses if these factors are poorly 

managed or will have a direct impact on 

our Stakeholders in their decision-mak-

ing processes, or on the economic, en-

vironmental, and social factors of using 

our products and services.  

Other factors include external factors 

outside the Group (such as political de-

velopment internationally or locally, so-

cio-economic factors, environmental is-

sues, and so on) where these factors 

will have material impact over the 

Group’s operational performance, eco-

nomically or socially. 

As introduced in the section “Our Cor-

porate Profile” in this report, our oper-

ations are separated into two main seg-

ments. In the application of materiality 

for the identification of material sus-

tainable topics, we looked into these 

two main segments and their presence 

in the various geographical locations 

where the operations of the respective 

segments are. We further identify 

whether the operations are significant 

to focus the scope of our reporting. 

We then proceed to identify the mate-

rial Sustainability Topic at a broad level, 

as presented in the Material Topic Ma-

trix (see Table 2). The accompanying 

risks, impacts and opportunities factors 

under each topic (“Sustainability Fac-

tors”) are then assigned and presented 

in the following Identified Sustainabil-

ity Factors Table (see Table 3). 

Most of our sustainability topics revolve 

around the new building and repair seg-

ment as it is the core business of the 

Group. The Group continuously assess, 

based on events occurring both inter-

nally and externally, information and 

feedbacks received from stakeholders, 

the relevance and materiality of each 

Sustainability Topic and Factors and 

shall report based on the latest relevant 

material Sustainability Topic and Fac-

tors. 

Specific management approach is fur-

ther detailed in each Sustainability 

Topic. 

Changes to Sustainability Topic 

We have increased the “Environmental 

Performance” from low-medium to me-

dium-medium (in respective to im-

portance to stakeholders and im-

pact/opportunities) in view of the in-

creasing significance of our shipping 

segment. Stakeholders will be con-

cerned on the environmental perfor-

mance in relation to our vessels. 

We have also reassessed our material 

Sustainability Topics and Sustainability 

Factors, resulting in the following 

changes: 

 Addition of Supply Chain as a mate-

rial Sustainability Topic. 

 Removed or combined factors that 

are assessed to be immaterial on its 

own or no longer material. 

 Added factors that further substan-

tiate each Sustainability Topic. 

We have further elaborated on the 

topic boundary and our approach to 

present a clearer picture for our Stake-

holders.

Management approach 

Our core business is a manpower-centric operation, and this reflects the 

importance in maintaining a healthy workforce and a safe working environment. 

High accident rate in the shipyard will reflect a risky work environment that will 

impair the morale and the confidence of the workers towards the Group. It will 

also expose the Group to potential litigation as well as fines from authorities. 

We are devoted in maintaining a healthy workforce and a safe working 

environment through the efforts detailed below, and further testified and audited 

with the attainment of OHSAS 18001:2007, SS 506: Part 1: 2009, and BizSAFE Star. 

HEALTH AND SAFETY OF WORK-

ERS 

Accidents are unforeseeable events and 

may not be entirely avoidable. None-

theless the Group aims to achieve a 

‘Zero Accident’ goal with adopted 

measures such as educating workers 

and implementing accident preventive 

procedures. Further initiatives include 

inculcating a ‘Safety First’ mindset to all 

workers on the ground as well as having 

an adequate number of safety officers 

on board vessels to supervise and en-

sure safety regulations are followed by 

workers. 

Safety starts from every individual, and 

that is where inculcating a ‘Safety First’ 

mindset is the utmost importance in 

achieving a ‘Zero Accident’ goal. This is 

done by emphasising safety matters 

during daily and weekly site briefings, 

putting up safety information posters 

around the site as well as implementing 

punitive system to penalise workers 

who knowingly breach safety regula-

tions. During lunch time, workers are al-

lowed to take a nap to recharge and re-

main alert for the remaining of the day. 

To further encourage individuals to be 

responsible for the safety of their own 

and people around them, the Group 

awards top performers during our an-

nual Safety Award Presentation to rec-

ognise the efforts put in by individuals. 

Each worker is appraised individually 

by the Department Manager based on 

his safety knowledge, number of safety 

infringements, number of accidents 

and incidents, proficiency in material 

handling, and so on. Top performing 

workers 

are 

then 

selected 

and 

awarded a Certificate of Recognition 

for the outstanding performance in 

Workplace Safety and Health for the 

year.  

Another level of safeguard over safety 

is by stationing safety officers on board 

vessels to supervise and ensure safety 

regulations are followed by workers. 

Supervisors working on board will pro-

vide an additional pair of eyes on 

safety. The Group ensures both the 

safety officers and supervisors are ade-

quately trained and updated by send-

ing them to courses (e.g. HSE Leader-

ship Courses). 

Our commitment to achieve a ‘Zero Ac-

cident’ goal is further demonstrated 

with the achievement of safety certifi-

cation OHSAS 18001:2007, SS 506: Part 

1: 2009 and BizSafe Star. Annual audit 

is required to ensure that safety proce-

dures are intact and followed before 

certifications can be renewed.

Safe Working Environment 

Injury statistics as seen in Tables 4 to 6 

are data tabulated from the new build-

ing and repair segment in the shipyard 

in Singapore for the Group, and consists 

wholly of our own male employees (fe-

males non-executive holds administra-

tive roles in the offices – refer to the 

section “Employment Practices – Diver-

sification of Workforce” in this report

for more information) in the shipyard. 

No third parties’ workers are engaged. 

The categories of injury are defined be-

low: 

 First Aid Injury (FAI): Incidents that 

require first aid treatment and are 

considered minor. The worker will 

be able to work as per normal. 

 Non-lost Time Injury (NLTI): Injury 

that are moderately light but re-

quire more medical attention as 

compared to FAI. According to doc-

tor’s instructions / recommenda-

tions, the worker will still be able to 

work on the day of incident, but on 

work that are deemed to be light 

duty and will not aggravate his in-

jury further. 

 Lost Time Injury (LTI): Any work-re-

lated injury or illness which prevents 

an employee from doing any work 

after an incident and / or being hos-

pitalised, but is not within the scope 

of Lost Time Accident below. 

 Lost Time Accident (LTA): A record-

able incident whereby an employee 

is not able to return to work or is as-

signed restricted work on the day 

following the incident and / or hos-

pitalised. ‘Recordable’ is deter-

mined by a medical leave of more 

than 3 days, or hospitalisation for 

more than 24 hours. 

The Group has seen an increased in In-

cident Frequency Rate from 18 cases 

per million man-hours in 2017 to 25 

cases per million man-hours in 2018. 

This was mainly due to the increase in 

number of cases of NLTI. LTI and LTA 

have decreased, which translates to a 

lower Incident Severity Rate of 84 man-

days lost per million man-hours in 2018 

from 169 man-days lost per million 

man-hours in 2017. The number of LTA 

cases decreased from 7 cases in 2017 to 

5 cases in 2018. 

The Group continues to strive towards 

‘Zero Accident’ goal and targets to cap 

the number of LTA cases in 2019 at 2 

cases and the IFR, ISR and ODR to be 

capped at 10 cases per million man-

hours and 30 man-days lost per million 

man-hours and zero cases per million 

man-hours respectively. 

All safety accidents must be reported to 

the safety officer. In an event of a work-

place injury, the worker is required to 

report directly to the immediate super-

visor on the incident or accident. The 

supervisor will then immediately report 

to the safety officer with details on how 

the incident or accident occurred, the 

exact time and location, and the injury 

sustained by the worker during the inci-

dent or accident. 

For prompt medical attention, workers 

are directed to nearby general prac-

tising medical clinics and private hospi-

tals, in addition to government hospi-

tals. In compliance to the local foreign 

worker legislation, workers are covered 

with the necessary insurance policies. 

Safe Living and Working Environment 

Majority of our workers in the shipyard 

stays in the dormitory, which includes  

rented dormitory (approved by Ministry 

of Manpower) as well as our own dor-

mitory. For rented dormitory, rules and 

regulations are imposed by the landlord 

to ensure that the dormitory is kept in 

healthy and liveable conditions. The 

onus of the creation and maintenance 

of a healthy and safe living environment 

for our own dormitory lies on our hand.  

We have imposed rules and regulations 

to all living in our dormitory and ensure 

that all workers abide by them to main-

tain a healthy and safe living environ-

ment. Serious offences such as display 

of violence, indecent behaviour, gam-

bling, shoplifting, drug abuse and 

money lending activity shall result in 

eviction of the workers from the dormi-

tory. Other offences, such as smoking at 

undesignated area, indiscriminate park-

ing of bicycles, failure to hang clothes 

on assigned racks, failure to tidy per-

sonal area and improper disposal of 

rubbish, attract fines. Spot checks by su-

pervisors and human resource staff are 

conducted at random so as to ensure 

that rules and regulations are adhered 

to, where punitive measures are im-

posed against workers in breach of the 

rules. 

We have also, in line with Building and 

Construction Authority’s rules and reg-

ulations, Ministry of Manpower Occu-

pational Safety and Health (“OSH”) reg-

ulations as well as OHSAS 18001:2007, 

implemented an Operational Control 

Procedure (“OCP”). The OCP detailed 

the following: 

 Responsibility to the relevant par-

ties in the Emergency Response 

Team (“ERT”). 

 Identification, assessment, and pre-

vention of OSH Emergencies Risks. 

 Emergency response protocol in the 

event of an emergency. 

 Site clean-up and follow-up proto-

col. 

The OCP is applicable to the workshop, 

office and dormitory (all situated at the 

same location at 10 Kwong Min Road) 

owned by the Group, in which it is ex-

tended to all personnel working at the 

workshop and office, a tenant renting 

partial of the workshop space, and 

workers staying in the dormitory. The 

effectiveness of the emergency re-

sponse protocol is assessed every year 

with the carrying out of an Emergency 

Evacuation Drill (the “Drill”). The Drill 

conducted for the financial year ended 

31 December 2018 was done in April 

2018, and it was conducted efficiently 

and successfully in accordance to the 

OCP, where all company personnel and 

tenants were accounted for at the mus-

ter point within 17 minutes from the 

start of the Drill. 

Global warming and safety  

Global warming has been affecting the 

whole world where extreme changes to 

the weather can be observed around 

the globe. 

In Singapore, we are observing higher 

temperatures and intense heat, accom-

panied by erratic storms. This expose 

our workers in our core business work-

ing in shipyards on board vessels to 

higher risk of heat injury and lightning 

risks arising from erratic thunderstorm. 

Safety officers are tasked to ensure that 

the workers, including themselves are 

protected against such weathers. Work-

ers exposed to intense heat are given 

frequent breaks to properly hydrate 

and cool themselves to prevent heat in-

jury, and in the case of wet weather 

workers on board will be evacuated 

from open space to sheltered areas.

and gender. 

 Presented a training hours per em-

Continue to assess the validity of the 

Sustainability Factors and the infor-

mation contained therein. 

Management Approach 

As our core business function relies heavily on manpower, labour practices in managing both employees’ welfare and devel-

opment, labour supply and costs affected by macro-factors such as inter-country relationship, and fair and equal employment 

practices have a direct impact on the sustainability of our operation, in terms of the costs of our operations and the employees’ 

job fulfilment. The Group aims to create a working culture that is fair, equal, inclusive, diverse, and free from any form of 

discrimination.  

EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES 

The first step to achieving the ideal 

work culture is to have a sound system 

of employment policy. Such policy in-

cludes care of the responsible hiring 

and fair compensation commensurate 

with non-bias and commonly accepted 

indicators and rights of employees. 

Work-life balance 

The Group understands the importance 

for our employees to strike a balance 

between their work commitment and 

their personal life. We provide a certain 

degree of flexibility by supporting their 

need to apply urgent leave to take care 

of their personal matters, particularly to 

family related matters, or pre-approved 

tweak in their work schedule to enable 

them to pick their children or go for 

night classes for skill upgrade courses. 

The Group also adheres to the applica-

ble employment legislation to provide 

paternal, maternal and childcare leave 

for employees to take care of their chil-

dren as and when required. 

Fair compensation and benefits 

The Group commits to compensating 

our employees fairly and commensu-

rate with employees’ position and expe-

rience, free from any discrimination. 

Employee’s compensation in Singapore 

is not subjected to minimum wages. 

Employees are also given benefits and 

compensation for overtime work pre-

scribed by the applicable employment 

law and regulations. 

Rights of employees 

The Group does not currently have any 

policy to either advocate or restrict 

rights of our employees to associate 

freely, engage in collective bargaining, 

participate in trade / labour union, as 

well as seek representation as long as it 

is permitted by the governing law and 

regulations. There is no collective bar-

gaining agreement for employees in the 

Group. 

In any event of significant operational 

changes that affects an employee, the 

employee will be notified at least one 

month in advance for them to have the 

necessary preparation. 

Ethical and responsible hiring 

The Group practises ethical and respon-

sible hiring. We do not practice nor ac-

cept any hiring of any persons that are 

either below the prescribed legal work-

ing age by the governing employment 

law and regulation of the country our 

operations are present (known subse-

quently as “child labour”) and the hiring 

of persons that are unwilling, forced, 

bonded, or other forms of compulsory 

forced labour that goes against the will 

and the natural course of the accepted 

norm of an employment process. 

In Singapore, employments, where ap-

plicable, are approved and/or submit-

ted to the respective Government au-

thorities overlooking labour matters. 

This ensure that employees are of legal 

age and protected by the employment 

legislation which forbids child, forced 

and compulsory labour. 

We ensure that our suppliers do their 

part in respect to their employees’ 

rights and practice ethical and responsi-

ble hiring through efforts detailed in 

Supply Chain Management. 

The Group has not been subjected to 

human rights review or human rights 

impact assessment in all geographical 

locations our operations are in. 

DIVERSIFICATION OF WORK-

FORCE 

An inclusive and diverse working cul-

ture requires an employment policy 

that accepts people of all backgrounds 

and not based on prejudicial selection.  

The Group understands the importance 

and benefits of having a diversified 

workforce, which includes: 

• Macro-factor relating to labour pol-

icy and relationship between Singa-

pore and other countries, affecting 

supply of labour and the associated 

cost. By recruiting workers of differ-

ent nationality, this prevent the 

over-reliance on one or two nation-

ality group(s) and mitigate the im-

pact on labour supply and cost 

from an unfavourable change in la-

bour policy and relationship on the 

said countries. 

• Socio-factor where workers learn 

how to interact, work and live with 

people of different ethnic and na-

tionality while working, and also 

adapting to the society outside 

work. This enable workers to be 

able to adapt and live in a cosmo-

politan nation like Singapore. 

• People from different location, 

coming from different culture, can 

propagate different positive work 

habit and input creative solutions 

to tackle challenges. 

• Reduce the chance of possible 

strikes and bullying due to over-

powering of one particular nation-

ality, ethnic or religious group. 

It is the Group’s policy to be open in the 

recruitment of persons of different 

background (e.g. gender, nationality, 

age and so on) for all positions (includ-

ing office positions).  

Our challenges in diversification of 

workers lies on the gender diversifica-

tion, where the bulk of our workforce in 

the core business is dominated by men. 

This is due to the nature of work in the 

shipyard demanding physical strength 

and exposure to the hot sun as well as 

the already male-dominated environ-

ment that female would normally re-

frain themselves from applying. 

All employees are permanent and full-

time staff during the years 2018 and 

2017.

OUR LABOUR PRACTICES 

18

CAREER DEVELOPMENT 

Attracting and retaining talents is an im-

portant step in achieving the ideal work 

culture.  

Furthermore, our reliance on skilled 

personnel (such as heavy equipment 

operators, 

draughtsmen, 

welders, 

grinders, etc) is unavoidable. Skilled 

personnel with the appropriate experi-

ences and/or requisite certifications in 

our industry are limited and competi-

tion for such personnel is intense. 

Hence, there is a need to continue to re-

tain the skilled personnel that we have 

trained.  

Therefore, we believe in the develop-

ment of our workers and this is in line 

with our mission. We send our employ-

ees for training not just for single trade 

but multiple trades so that workers can 

be re-deployed whenever reshuffling of 

workforce is required.  

This give them a sense of job satisfac-

tion, personal development and en-

hance job security and employability of 

each employee, which we hope will in-

spire greater intrinsic value within 

themselves. 

This policy also enables us to be less re-

liance on the external labour market, 

improve efficiency and quality in the 

work produced by the workers, as well 

as give workers the opportunity to de-

velop and excel within the Group. 

Furthermore, all employees are sub-

jected to performance review, regard-

less of employment category or gender 

and without prejudice. These perfor-

mance reviews are conducted on an an-

nual basis where employees’ perfor-

mance during the year are assessed. 

Through these appraisals, management 

can identify areas for development of 

each employee’s skill set. 

New hire and turnover of employees 

Despite the efforts stated above to re-

tain our skilled workers, the Group 

practices lean cost management (since 

2015) by managing and restructuring 

our headcount to align with the de-

mand in the marine, oil and gas indus-

tries. The employee turnover and hire 

rates are expected to stabilise as the 

market stabilise. Please refer to Tables 

11 to 12 for the data on new hire and 

turnover of employees. 

Our turnover rate has decreased from 

56.5% in 2017 to 23.3% in 2018. Simi-

larly, the hire rate has decreased from 

14.1% to 2.0% (refer to Table 13). 

Training 

We have not presented training for 

other employment categories as those 

are cyclical in nature and immaterial 

(11% of the Group’s workforce). Train-

ing provided to non-executives are only 

to all male non-executives due to the 

circumstances that all female non-exec-

utives holds administrative office roles. 

Training hours per employees per year 

has decreased from 16 hours per em-

ployee per year to 14 hours. This was 

due to the Group’s efforts in reducing 

the workforce, and majority of the core 

training for the workers have been com-

pleted in 2016 and these trained work-

ers are still with the Group. 

LABOUR POLICY AND RELATION-

SHIP BETWEEN SINGAPORE AND 

OTHER COUNTRIES AND ITS RELE-

VANT LAWS AND REGULATIONS 

A clear understanding of the applicable 

labour laws and regulations, as well as 

the labour policy and relationship be-

tween Singapore and other countries 

are required given that our shipyard 

business relies largely on foreign work-

ers (including skilled workers) from 

Thailand, Bangladesh, China, India, Ma-

laysia and Myanmar to meet our staff-

ing needs.  

Our labour supply and its associated 

costs are correlated to developments of 

labour policies of the abovementioned 

countries as well as the relationship be-

tween them and Singapore. In addition 

to the above, we are also subjected by 

local employment legislation, in terms 

of hiring quota, levies and security 

bonds. Any unfavourable changes to ei-

ther of the above will definitely affect 

our operations.  

We stay constantly updated to the la-

bour policies between Singapore and 

other countries, and to the local legisla-

tion (largely in particular to the Singa-

pore Budget), so as to react and tweak, 

at the earliest possible, our employ-

ment practices accordingly to minimise 

and mitigate any unfavourable impact.

OUR ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY 

Management Approach 

The going-concern and profitability of 

the Company is without a doubt the 

highest concern for stakeholders. Fi-

nancially sound strategy and opera-

tional method for the present and the 

future determine the profitability and 

sustainability of the Group. The accu-

rate and transparent presentation of fi-

nancial information in the financial 

statements will provide transparency of 

the performance and position of the 

Group for Stakeholders. 

We constantly review our operation 

and strategy risks affecting the sustain-

ability of our businesses. The Group is 

on constant lookout for changes in busi-

ness trends and opportunities to shift 

our business directions accordingly. 

This is accompanied by consultation 

with professionals, to ensure that the 

Group’s directions are on the right 

track. 

We also seriously consider and assess 

any weakness and lapse in controls 

made known during audits and strive to 

enhance the internal controls to ensure 

the effectiveness of our controls, as well 

as to ensure the true and fair view of 

the financial statements. 

PERFORMANCE IN 2018 

Economic value generated by the Group 

was reported at S$28.8 million in 2018, 

increased from S$24.3 million in 2017. 

Total expenditure incurred by the 

Group, excluding Employee Wages &amp; 

Benefits was S$17.0 million in 2018, de-

creased from S$12.9 million in 2017. 

Group net profit was S$0.2 million in 

2018, versus a net loss of S$3.7 million 

in 2017.  

The increase of revenue was mainly due 

to more repair and fabrication projects 

in 2018 as compared to 2017, and more 

chartering and chandler activities in 

2018 as compared to 2017. 

Earnings per share (“EPS”) was 0.69 

cents in 2018, up from loss per share of 

1.83 cents in 2017. 

The Group incurred a cost of capital of 

S$421,000 in 2018, increased from 

S$261,000 in 2017. Cost of capital in-

cludes interest paid on bank borrowings 

and finance lease. No cash dividend was 

paid for the financial years ended 31 

December 2018 and 2017. 

Government Taxes 

In 2018, the Group received an amount 

of S$100,000 from government grant 

for financial assistance for employee 

wages and benefits and capital invest-

ment matters. 

The Group paid no taxes in 2018, pri-

marily to the Singapore tax jurisdiction 

where most of our operations are 

based. The Group has sufficient de-

ferred tax assets to cover any chargea-

ble income. Taxes paid are net of any 

tax rebates granted by the government, 

where applicable. 

Staff Costs 

In 2018, staff costs amounted to S$11.6 

million for 460 employees, which de-

creased from S$14.9 million for 700 em-

ployees in 2017, in the form of salary, 

wages, pension scheme based on re-

spective jurisdictions (mainly Singa-

pore’s Central Provident Fund (“CPF”)), 

foreign workers’ levy, skill development 

fund and other staff benefits (including, 

but not limited to, welfare given to staff 

and bonuses).

TRUE AND FAIR VIEW OF THE  

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Financial information represented in 

the Annual Report is a medium of com-

munication to the Stakeholders in in-

forming how the Group is performing. 

We understand the importance of our 

Stakeholders and management in mak-

ing informed decisions based on the An-

nual Report that presents a true and fair 

view of the Group’s financial perfor-

mance and position.  

We ensure that the information con-

tained in our Annual Reports are both 

adequate and free from misstatement 

(which can arise from an error, or from 

a fraudulent activity that remains undis-

covered). Efforts made to ensure the 

true and fair view of the financial state-

ments includes: 

 Implementation of procedures; 

 Sending the finance team for train-

ing and updates; 

 Implementation of whistle-blowing 

procedures; and 

 Introduction of contractual provi-

sions to allow the Company to re-

claim incentive components linked 

to the performance of the Company. 

Implementation of procedures 

The Group has implemented proce-

dures manual to govern the Group on 

how operational procedures should be 

carried out, and how employees should 

behave and perform in the interest of 

the Group. 

Training and Updates 

We periodically sent our finance team 

for training and updates on the relevant 

reporting standards, such as those re-

quired by the Financial Reporting Stand-

ards of Singapore, the Code, SGX Catal-

ist Rules, and so on. This is to ensure 

that the Annual Report is prepared in 

accordance to the required standards 

and rules so as to give a true and fair 

view of the financial position and per-

formance of the Group. The above func-

tion is undertaken by the Committee 

(refer to the section “Our Commitment 

to Sustainable Operation” of this re-

port for the detailed responsibility of 

the Committee) to oversee compliance 

matters of the Annual Report.

Whistle-blowing 

Whistle-blowing procedures have been 

implemented to ensure that all man-

agement personnel acts in the interest 

of the Stakeholders. All this information 

is reported as required under the Code 

and can be found in the Annual Report 

2018 page 29. Whistle-blowing policy 

and whistle-blowing reports received (if 

any), will be assessed by the Audit and 

Risk Committee from time to time. 

Please refer to the section on “Our 

Commitment to a Sustainable Opera-

tion” in this report for further details.

Incentive-linked remuneration 

The remuneration of the Executive Di-

rectors’ and the key Management is 

linked to the performance of the Com-

pany (please refer to the Annual Report 

2018 page 22). With effect from 2018, 

the Company has adopted contractual 

provisions to safeguard against material 

misstatement of financial statements to 

deter and recover from the unlikely 

event of deliberate manipulation of the 

performance of the Company. Such 

contractual provisions allow the Com-

pany to reclaim incentive components 

of the remuneration from the Executive 

Directors’ and the key Management in 

the exceptional circumstances of mis-

statement of financial results or mis-

conduct resulting in financial loss to the 

Company. 

PROJECT AND QUALITY MANAGE-

MENT 

New building and repair segment 

It is known that ineffective, poor plan-

ning and slow execution of a project 

plan can result in costly avoidable losses 

(such as wastages, disputable damages, 

overrun in project costs, liquidated 

damage claims and terminations from 

customers). At such, we have invested 

heavily on effective project manage-

ment system to ensure effective and 

safe project execution with high quality 

deliverables.  

We have testified the above with the at-

tainment of ISO, OHSAS and BizSafe Star 

certifications since 2009, which is a tes-

tament to our effective implementation 

of the processes across the Group. The 

certifications require us to be audited 

on an annual basis, which ensure that 

the above mention processes stay ef-

fective on a continuing basis. 

Shipping segment 

Similarly, we have high confidence on 

the operational processes in the ship 

chartering and marine supplies divi-

sions to deliver high quality and timely 

charter services as well as efficient and 

timely supply of marine supplies.  

The ship chartering division constantly 

monitors the performances and co-or-

dination between the relevant agents 

and brokers to ensure that the vessels 

are competently crewed and well main-

tained at all times so as to ensure high 

utilisation with repeated customers at 

profitable rates, as well as avoid any 

downtime arising from poor co-ordina-

tion and planning which will result in 

demurrages and loss of charter oppor-

tunities. 

In the context of marine supplies, the 

division will ensure that the supply 

chain is properly managed, by fulfilling 

pre-requisites that may be imposed by 

suppliers so as to receive the supplies in 

good time shortly before fulfilling the 

promised delivery date to the custom-

ers. This mitigate risk arising from poor 

coordination with vendors, ship owners 

and ship managers that will result in 

poor customers’ satisfaction and loss of 

business opportunities. 

DIVERSIFICATION OF TRADES 

The Group understands the importance 

of diversification as the marine and off-

shore oil and gas industries are cyclical 

in nature. Any downturn in global or 

trade specific economic conditions such 

as the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, 

as well as the downturn in marine and 

offshore oil and gas industries due to 

the drastic fall in oil prices since 2015, 

will adversely affect us. There is no as-

surance that future economic down-

turns will not occur and hence steps to 

diversify are constantly being evaluated 

and implemented.  

Furthermore, diversification creates 

synergy, and allows sharing of technical 

resources, reduction of operational 

costs, higher market penetration and 

expansion of customer and supplier 

base.  

Besides expanding to undertake EPC, 

we are also constantly looking into pos-

sibilities of acquisition or establishment 

of complementary businesses or joint 

ventures with sustainable parties as and 

when opportunities arise. 

In 2012, we launched our first bareboat 

charter vessel after assessing the per-

formance of this segment and noted its 

potential. In 2016, we officially placed 

more resources to further develop the 

shipping segment, with the acquisition 

of an additional vessel and started spot 

chartering services in December 2016. 

In mid-2017, we started the marine sup-

plies division.  

In 2018, our focus was to expand the 

shipping segment, where revenue from 

the shipping segment stands at 23.7% 

(2017: 16.8%) of the Group’s revenue. 

The Group fell short of the targeted 30% 

for 2018 due to the change in segmen-

tal presentation as mentioned in the 

section “Our Corporate Profile” in this 

report and Annual Report page 108.  

With the diversification, revenue contri-

bution concentration on new building 

and repair of offshore and marine struc-

tures and vessels has reduced. Revenue 

from our top customer in the core busi-

ness during 2018 was 72.0%, a decrease 

from 91.9% in 2017 from the same top 

customer. 

MITIGATION OF IMPACT FROM 

CLIMATE CHANGE 

The demand for oil and gas is likely to 

continue to change structurally in the 

coming years, with the Paris Climate 

Agreement first passed in 12 December 

2015 and with the recent COP42 in Ka-

towice, Poland (also known as the 24th 

Conference of the Parties to the United 

Nations Framework Convention on Cli-

mate Change (“UNFCCC”)). 

The conference continues to press na-

tions to commit even tremendous 

global climate efforts to slow down 

global warming to under 2°C, emphasis-

ing that current efforts are far from ef-


ES GROUP (HOLDINGS) LIMITED 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 

OUR ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY 

22

ficient in achieving the goal.  The con-

ference also gave birth to a common cli-

mate rulebook, known as the Paris 

Agreement Rulebook (also common re-

ferred as the Katowice Rulebook) that 

aims to regulate on carbon emissions 

reduction and reporting. 

Carbon emissions are directly corre-

lated to the demand in the marine, off-

shore, oil and gas, where demand is 

likely to reduce over time with renewa-

ble energy sources sought for. This may 

drive oil prices to new low progressively 

which we expect this may affect us in 

the following manner: 

New building and repair segment 

Business activities in shipyards are ex-

pected to be impacted, and thus our 

core business will take a hit financially. 

As the market demand changes in the 

marine, offshore, oil and gas industries 

alongside with global trend, we will 

have to adapt and grow with the new 

changes. For instance, we have since 

2016 shifted our focus from the new 

building and conversion projects to the 

repair projects as we expected the de-

mand for the new building and conver-

sion to weaken over time. On the same 

note, we have also focus more on the 

expansion in our shipping segment this 

year. 

Shipping segment 

Our vessels are oil tank bunkers de-

signed for the transportation of marine 

and gas oil for oil and gas companies. 

The impact of global warming will result 

in a change in market condition, either 

due to a change in the terrain through-

out the region or the change in demand 

for chartering services.  

We have been sensitive to the size of 

our fleet and the physical size of our 

vessels while we expand this new seg-

ment. We constantly monitor market 

conditions within Southeast Asia, assess 

market competition before we decide 

on the viability of expanding our fleet 

size and vessel type to satisfy the cur-

rent market condition. 

Please refer to section “Diversification 

of Trade” in this report for diversifica-

tion efforts that further mitigate this 

risk.

The effectiveness of our sustainability

We will however restrict our boundary 

to only active efforts that are applicable 

to our immediate suppliers, subcontrac-

tors, charterer, contractors, or end-user 

due to the practicality constraint. 

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT 

New building and repair segment 

In our core business, we primarily con-

tract with and supply skilled labour and 

services to a shipyard (i.e. the contrac-

tor), acting as a resident subcontractor. 

The contractor is primarily responsible 

with the procurement of the required 

equipment and materials for the build-

ing, conversion and repairs work on the 

vessels. The contractor imposes regula-

tions to regulate us, such as on areas of 

safety, material handling, and so on. We 

are responsible for the procurement of 

safety equipment, components and 

small equipment in the course of the 

supply of skilled labour and services. 

The completed job is first handed over 

to our contractor who will in turn hand-

over the vessel once it is completed and 

ready for voyage. 

Shipping segment 

The shipping segment comprises of ship 

chartering, and the trading of marine 

supplies to vessels. The execution of a 

complete ship charter starts by char-

terer engaging us to transport liquid oil 

from Singapore to a Southeast Asia des-

tination, we then engage port agents 

(both local and the Southeast Asia re-

gion), commercial managers, ship man-

agers, and suppliers supplying marine 

gas oil and other marine supplies for the 

operation of our vessels. 

As required by the Marine and Port Au-

thority of Singapore (“MPA”) and in line 

with International Maritime Organisa-

tion (“IMO”), we will periodically con-

duct surveys on the vessels to ensure 

that it is optimal for voyages. We en-

gage professional surveyors, equipment 

manufacturers, and subcontractors to 

survey, supply equipment, and service 

the vessels. 

In our marine supplies division, we en-

gage suppliers and subcontractors for 

the bespoke fabrication of vessel’s com-

ponents as well as the trading of con-

sumables on board vessels that are re-

quired by the customer. Goods, compo-

nents and services are acquired from 

suppliers, and the requested goods are 

subsequently delivered to the custom-

ers. 

Management 

The Group is in the midst of drafting our 

first Supplier Code of Conduct and is 

targeting to circulate to our suppliers 

within 2019. This Supplier Code of Con-

duct is expected to be abided by all sup-

pliers and subcontractors to ensure the 

sustainability of their operations in all 

areas of economic, environment, social 

and governance, which comprises of 

topic on business conduct, labour prac-

tices, health and safety, and environ-

mental management. We believe that 

this will positively value-add to our sus-

tainability effort throughout our supply 

chain and even benefit our suppliers 

themselves. 

New suppliers are assessed for any bad 

reputation and records, together with 

any presence of applicable certifica-

tions and licenses. These are credentials 

towards key sustainability factors rele-

vant to us. Continuing assessments, 

such as mandated reporting, inspection 

visits or enquiry of information, shall be 

made accordingly to ensure the stand-

ards of safety and health, quality, and 

environment. We will make the neces-

sary changes upon observation of un-

satisfactory standard. 

As for customers, we will ensure that 

the provision of the sales or services are 

not directly associated to matters on 

breach of safety, financial and environ-

mental scandals, or any other unethical 

practices. 

For those parties who are other than 

our immediate suppliers, subcontrac-

tors, charterer, contractors, or end-

user, we will made effort to disassociate 

in the event that it is made known to us 

through credible sources (such as pro-

fessional consultants, public news, and 

etc.) that there is breach of safety, fi-

nancial and environmental scandals, or 

any other unethical practices. 

The Group is committed to make con-

tinuous efforts to work closely with par-

ties in our supply chain to ensure best 

practices and alignment of policies. We 

are opened to listen to them. 

Commitment 

We practice fair competition in compli-

ance of applicable competition laws and 

regulations in our businesses. In 2018, 

there are no legal actions taken against 

the Group for anti-competitive behav-

iour, anti-trust, and monopoly prac-

tices.

OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE

OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE

Management approach 

Environmental effort is an increasing 

hot topic around the world, and Singa-

pore has committed on environmental 

effort with the signing of Paris Agree-

ment in 22 April 2016 followed by the 

ratification on 21 September 2016. The 

Group is committed to participate in the 

effort of being “green” to be aligned 

with the nation and global effort.  

The inaugural Sustainability Report 

published in November 2018 for the re-

porting year of 2017 has initiated our 

attention to environmental issues in re-

lation to our sustainability. We had then 

identified the existing efforts we have 

made as well as the relating Sustainabil-

ity Factors that we can work on as part 

of our effort and commitment. We have 

implemented controls this year to rec-

ord and have recorded data on energy 

consumption and the associated emis-

sions.  

The boundary of this topic is restricted 

to the operations in Singapore, exclud-

ing vessels due to the limitation in con-

trol to capture data from vessels, and 

the insignificance of the overseas oper-

ations (as illustrated in “Our Sustaina-

bility Topics” in this report). We have 

chosen not to extend our boundary to 

the consumption made indirectly in our 

core business’ contractor’s shipyard 

due to the limited access to and availa-

bility of that information. We will only 

be able to report the consumption di-

rectly from the service provider or sup-

plier where consumption information is 

readily available. 

We apply the Precautionary Principle 

(as described in The Rio Declaration on 

Environment and Development (1992)

Principle 15) via the applicable legisla-

tion and regulations in our business to 

stay in compliance to the abovemen-

tioned legislation and regulations, 

where efforts are detailed below. 

ENERGY CONSUMPTION 

We have started tracking our energy 

consumption data for the Group in 

2018, but this is only for the direct con-

sumption of energy purchased from 

service providers.  

The Group has consumed a total of 

938,575 kWh of energy (a net of 

849,272 kWh after deducting subse-

quent consumption reimbursed) in the 

form of electricity, gas and fuel pur-

chased from service providers. Out of 

which 89,303 kWh relates to energy 

used in dormitories and are subse-

quently reimbursed to the Group from 

workers staying in the dormitory. 100% 

of the energy consumed is non-renew-

able. 

EMISSIONS

The Group reported a total emission8 of 

300 metric tonnes (“MT”) of carbon di-

oxide (“CO2”) in 2018 (a net of 264 MT 

after deducting emission related to the 

consumption subsequently reimbursed 

to the Group from workers staying in 

the dormitory of 36 MT, of which all are 

Scope 2 Emissions). The figure com-

prises of Scope 1 Emissions9 of 177 MT 

and Scope 2 Emissions10 of 123 MT.

Scope 1 Emissions refers to direct GHG emissions occur from sources that are owned or controlled by the Group, expressed in CO2 

equivalent in MT, as defined in GHG Protocol “A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard”. Figures excludes emissions from 

combustion of biomass, which the Group does not have.

The composition of emissions only in-

cludes CO2. For 2018, we have not 

quantified the emissions from our ves-

sels, and is confined within Singapore’s 

operations. 

Scope 1 Emissions comprises direct 

emissions of fossil fuel consumed di-

rectly by the Group’s vehicles. Scope 2 

Emissions comprises electricity and gas 

consumed by the Group. The resources 

reported here is the same as those re-

ported in Energy Consumption Sustain-

ability Factor. 

WATER COMSUMPTION 

The Group reports a total consumption 

of 40,630 cubic metres (“m3”) in 2018. 

The water consumed is 100% from mu-

nicipal water supplies. 

EFFLUENTS AND WASTE 

New building and repair segment 

The core business involves heavy usage 

of materials. However, as a resident 

subcontractor based in our contractor’s 

shipyard, we are bounded by the regu-

lations imposed by the shipyard on how 

materials are used and disposed. The 

onus is on us to abide to the regulations 

set out by the contractor. All materials 

for the purpose of new building and re-

pair works, are issued by the shipyard. 

Excess materials unutilised are returned 

to the shipyard for reuse. Any minor 

remnants of material are disposed in lo-

cations designated by the shipyard, and 

subsequently collected by waste collec-

tor. This ensure that wastage contrib-

uted by our workers are minimised and 

properly handled.

On the part of the Group’s effort, we 

educate our employees on the im-

portance of efficient usage to reduce 

material wastage. Trainings are pro-

vided to improve the skillset of the 

workers, which will also translate to 

lesser wastage arising from inefficient 

use of materials. The materials pur-

chased directly by us are safety equip-

ment and small materials where dispos-

als abide to the shipyard regulation. 

Shipping segment 

Our vessels are registered under MPA’s 

Ship Registry of Ships (“SRS”), and the 

pre-requisites relating to the vessels are 

fulfilled 

through 

the 

classification 

awarded by Bureau Veritas and Nippon 

Kaiji Kyokai, which covers the compli-

ance to various key convention and reg-

ulations set by the IMO and the Interna-

tional Labour Organization (“ILO”). In-

cluding in the classification is the vari-

ous certifications covering key environ-

mental conventions as seen in Table 19. 

The certifications are credentials of ef-

forts taken to ensure that the structure, 

equipment systems, fittings and mate-

rial used for the vessels fully comply 

with the requirements to prevent envi-

ronmental pollution, be it through im-

proper, unintentional, and/or acci-

dental discharge of oil, spill of oil, dis-

posal of garbage waste, and discharge 

of ozone depleting substances. We 

have no incidents of any of the above 

mentioned in 2018. 

OUR EFFORTS  

We continue to commit in reducing the 

use of carbon-emitting transportation 

to transport our workers. We are still 

using dormitory that houses workers 

within walkable distance to the ship-

yard. Out of the total workforce of 460, 

208 and 66 workers are currently stay-

ing in the shipyard and near (i.e. walking 

distance) the shipyard respectively.  

To further reduce the indirect emission 

of GHG via the use of public transport, 

we have and are still providing each 

worker with a bicycle. This is in line with 

the nation’s effort of a “Car-lite” city. 

For other workers staying at our own 

dormitory which is located outside the 

shipyard, we transport them to the 

shipyard using commercial buses and 

we ensure that the buses are fully occu-

pied to maximise efficiency of each bus-

trip.  

OTHER COMPLIANCE MATTERS 

The Group has no operations that are 

on or near any habitat that are pro-

tected or have high biodiversity value as 

identified by international bodies such 

as the International Union for Conserva-

tion of Nature (“IUCN”). 

As of the reporting date of the Annual 

Report 2018, the Group has not been 

penalised for any non-compliance of 

environmental laws and regulations im-

posed by Singapore and will continue to 

work with the relevant authorities to 

stay updated so as to continue to com-

ply with the laws and regulations.
