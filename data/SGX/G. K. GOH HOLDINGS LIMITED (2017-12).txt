Board Statement 

 

The Board of Directors and Management of G. K. Goh Holdings Limited (the “Company”) and its 

subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) are committed to creating long-term value for all its stakeholders 

through sustainable business strategies and practices. 

 

Together with Management, the Board identifies the key stakeholders, determines the material 

Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) factors to be managed, and oversees the management 

and monitoring of these factors. 

 

 

Organisation Profile 

 

The Group has evolved from its origins as a leading Singapore-based regional securities business into 

an investment company owning operating businesses as well as a diverse portfolio of investments. 

 

The Group has operating businesses in Corporate Services and Aged Care.  The Corporate Services 

business is housed under Boardroom Limited (“Boardroom”), a Singapore-listed corporate services 

provider in Asia and Australia. 

 

The Aged Care business is operated through Allium Healthcare Holdings Pte Ltd (“Allium”), which 

provides a range of geriatric care services in Singapore.  Allium has also invested in Opal Aged Care 

Group, a leading Australian provider of residential aged care services; and Habitat Assets Pte Ltd, a 

fund that invests in a portfolio of operating retirement villages in Australia. 

 

The Financial Investments arm holds a portfolio of listed and unlisted equities as well as third-party 

managed funds.  The key long-term investments include Eastern &amp; Oriental Berhad, a Malaysian 

property development and hospitality group, and euNetworks Group, which owns extensive assets in 

optic fibre networks in Europe. 

 

The Group supported local businesses and helped to create jobs through the goods and services 

purchased from its suppliers, which included office space providers, technology and information 

services providers, as well as professional consultants. 

 

 

Sustainability Reporting Approach 

 

The Group’s Corporate Services subsidiary, Boardroom Limited, is listed on the Singapore Exchange 

and will be publishing a separate sustainability report on its website www.boardroomlimited.com. 

 

Therefore this Sustainability Report will outline the sustainability policies, practices and performance of 

the Group’s Aged Care and Financial Investments business units for the financial year ended 31 

December 2017 (“FY2017”), and it is prepared in accordance with the following regulations, guidelines 

and framework: 

 

 

SGX-ST Listing Rules (711A and 711B); 

 

 

SGX Sustainability Reporting Guide; and 

 

 

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards 2016 - Core.  The GRI Content Index can be found at 

the end of this report. 

 

The Board has determined the reporting content on the basis of materiality assessment and 

stakeholders’ interests, expectations and concerns.  To ensure reporting quality, the Board has 

observed the principles of accuracy, balance, clarity, comparability, reliability and timeliness to help 

stakeholders assess the Group’s overall ESG performance.

Employees 

 

The Group recognises that its ability to remain commercially viable and competitive is influenced by its 

continued success in attracting and retaining talent.  It is committed to building a safe, nurturing and 

inclusive workforce where all employees are treated respectfully and professionally, and are given equal 

opportunity based on merit.  The remuneration framework for all employees comprises a fixed 

component in the form of a base salary and a variable component in the form of a bonus.  The bonus 

is linked to the Group’s and the employee’s performance. 

 

The Group encourages its employees to further their potential by supporting lifelong learning and skills 

development.  Employees who attend courses that are related to their fields of specialty are able to 

seek reimbursement for the course fees.  They are also entitled to 2 days of exam or study leave each 

year. 

 

In caring for the well-being of the employees, the Group offers a range of benefits to allow employees 

achieve better work-life balance.  These benefits include annual leave, parental leave, healthcare 

benefits and life and accident insurance.  The Group also offers flexible work options such as staggered 

working hours and work-from-home arrangements. 

 

As at 31 December 2017, the Group’s Aged Care and Financial Investments business units employed 

a total of 22 permanent full-time employees, all located in Singapore.  There were no temporary or part-

time employees.  The rates of new employee hires and employee turnover during the year were 32% 

and 14% respectively.  As the Aged Care business unit ramps up its operations in the coming years, 

these numbers are expected to increase significantly.  The Group aims to keep the turnover rate below 

20%.

Environment 

 

The Group is in the process of building its first nursing home, Allium Care Suites, in Venus Drive and 

this accounts for the majority of its direct environmental impact.  To manage its environmental footprint, 

the Group is committed to design and construct a green, sustainable building which is energy effective 

and resource efficient. 

 

The building is designed with envelope thermal transfer value (“ETTV”) of less than 38W/m2.  ETTV is 

an indicator of the heat gain through the external walls and windows of a building.  A lower ETTV implies 

that there is less heat gain by the building, thereby reducing the heat load and subsequent energy 

consumption of the building’s air-conditioning system.  The building will also be equipped with energy-

saving LED lighting, and a solar photovoltaic system to replace a portion of the total building energy 

consumption. 

 

The Group targets to obtain the BCA Green Mark Platinum certification for Allium Care Suites upon its 

completion in 2019. 

 

During the year, to help reduce greenhouse emissions from energy consumption, the Group replaced 

conventional lighting in its corporate office with LED lighting.

Anti-corruption 

 

The Group adopts a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption, and employees are expected 

to conduct their business activities in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  All 

employees are guided by a code of ethics and business conduct (“Code of Ethics”) and code of best 

practices on securities transactions (“Code of Best Practices”), which are disseminated to them at the 

start of their employment.  Further information on the Codes can be found in the Corporate Governance 

section of the Annual Report 2017. 

 

The Group has also developed a Procurement Policy to ensure that its procurement process is fair, and 

to reduce the risk of complaints and legal challenges.  The policy specifies the procedures in all aspects 

of the procurement process, from requests for quotations to dispute resolution, and will be reviewed 

periodically for relevance. 

 

The most significant procurement transaction undertaken by the Group in 2017 was the selection of 

contractor for construction of Allium Care Suites.  The internal auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 

was engaged to conduct a special review of the process and their recommendations for improvement 

had been adopted in full. 

 

The Group is pleased to report that there were no incidents of bribery or corruption during the year.
