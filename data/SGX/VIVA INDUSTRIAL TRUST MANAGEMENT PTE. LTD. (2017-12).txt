SUSTAINAbILITy REPORT 2017


board sTaTEMEnT

The board of Directors (the “board”) of the managers of 

VIT, is pleased to publish our 2nd annual sustainability 

report. The report outlines how we managed our material 

economic, environmental and social impact in the stated 

period. We adopted the latest GRI Standards issued by the 

Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) which also complies 

with SGX Sustainability Reporting Guide.

We are committed to value creation for our stakeholders 

through upholding the strictest corporate governance 

standards and achieving sustainable business as part 

of our strategy formulation. The board endorses the 

identification of the material Environmental, Social and 

Governance (ESG) factors covered in this report, and also 

provides oversight and guidance on monitoring of these 

material ESG factors through quarterly review of the key 

performance indicators.

On the economic front, VIT remains focused on achieving 

long-term growth across the board in gross revenue, 

net property income (NPI), distributable income and 

distribution per stapled security (DPS) while remaining 

prudent in our capital and risk management.

Our environmental approach mainly involves closely 

monitoring the energy consumption in our properties to 

identify opportunities for reduction. We also track water 

consumption at our properties and strive to conserve and 

reduce its usage where possible. 

Tenant satisfaction is pivotal to ensure VIT’s properties 

remain appealing to our existing and prospective tenants. 

We engage with our tenants proactively to understand 

issues and meet their needs. This report includes the 

results of our annual tenant satisfaction survey and areas 

of survey covered.

Our employees play a central role in sustaining VIT’s 

growth. We endeavour to develop our human capital 

through adopting a continuous learning journey and 

cultivating cohesive corporate culture in order to attract 

and retain the right talent.

Finally, responsible corporate citizenship is at the heart 

of our values. We contribute to building community 

resilience through supporting various programmes. We 

remain committed to aligning VIT’s growth strategies with 

sustainable business practices in creating long-term value 

and growth for our stakeholders.

CREATInG lonG-TERM VAluE

We are committed to creating long-term value for our 

stakeholders. Our sustainability strategy is to assess and 

manage the most material economic, environmental and 

social impacts, risks and opportunities arising from our 

business operations with an aim to support sustainable 

growth of our business.

Materiality assessment is at the heart of our sustainability 

strategy. We first carried out a comprehensive materiality 

assessment in May 2016 to identify sustainability topics 

that reflect VIT’s significant impacts as well as our 

stakeholders’ interest. The process enabled us to prioritise 

topics for our inaugural sustainability report. 

In 2017, we reviewed and reassessed VIT’s material 

sustainability issues. Members of the senior management 

team, including the CEO, participated in the review 

process. As part of the review, we took into account the 

sustainability reporting trends in the REIT sector. We also 

considered the feedback received on our first sustainability 

report from various stakeholders. The review included 

re-examining our key stakeholders and the topics raised 

by them in the course of our routine interactions with 

them. based on the exercise, we have selected the topics 

that represent VIT’s significant impact on the economy, 

environment and society.

ConTInuouSly IMPRoVInG TEnAnT ExPERIEnCE

The REIT Manager considers tenant satisfaction a top 

priority. The REIT Manager has adopted an integrated 

engagement approach to serving the tenants effectively. 

The engagement goes beyond addressing tenants’ 

needs and expectations relating to the smooth running 

of their operations. The REIT Manager actively seeks 

tenants’ participation in social initiatives. A number of 

initiatives have been implemented to engage, partner and 

collaborate with tenants to support social causes.

In 2017, the REIT Manager organised regular tenant 

engagement events including weekly workout activities 

and talks related to health, investment and well-being on 

a regular basis.

TEnAnT SERVICES

Ensuring excellent tenant experience is a top priority for 

us. We maintain high professional standards right from the 

leasing process to the lease renewal process. We ensure 

that the overall upkeep of the properties meets high-

quality standards. Our key performance indicators include 

hassle-free billing and payment process, cleanliness of 

common areas and toilets, professional customer service, 

lifts maintenance, security arrangements, landscaping, 

and effective air-conditioning to name a few.

hEAlTh, hyGIEnE And SAFETy

Protecting tenants, visitors, employees and contractors 

from potential health and safety risks is an essential aspect 

of our property management. 

We have implemented the necessary health and safety 

measures in our properties to prevent and manage 

the potential risks and incidents. The key areas of our 

attention include fire safety, slips, trips and falls, first aid, 

vector control measures to prevent mosquito breeding, 

maintenance of lifts and escalators, proper lighting 

throughout the premises, and security.

Through our “Get Healthy Programme”, we promote 

active living among our tenants as well as our employees 

by organising workout sessions on bi-monthly basis. Our 

“Wellness Day” initiative encourages healthy eating by 

giving out fresh fruits to tenants on a quarterly basis.

TEnAnT SATISFACTIon SuRVEy

Ensuring pleasant tenant experience is a key priority for 

us. We periodically conduct tenant satisfaction surveys 

to gather actionable feedback. The survey, conducted 

by a third party, covers various areas such as leasing 

and renewal process, accounting and billing experience, 

property 

management 

agent’s 

customer 

service, 

cleanliness, physical condition and maintenance, security 

and car park. Tenants are asked to rate various services on 

a scale of 1 to 7.

The senior management reviews the survey findings 

and take the necessary measures for continuous 

improvements.

In the latest VIT Tenants Survey, our ratings improved across 

segments as the REIT Manager acted on the feedback 

received in the prior year’s survey to improve tenant 

experience. The overall customer service rating covering 

all properties in the 2017 survey improved to 7.7 from the 

previous score of 6.2. The score for the single-tenanted 

properties was 8.6 while the multi-tenanted properties 

scored 6.8, both registering an increase over the preceding 

year’s rating.

RESPonSIBly

VIT’s significant environmental impacts include energy 

and water consumption in properties managed by the 

REIT Manager. The REIT Manager’s approach is to improve 

energy efficiency and water conservation. Energy and 

water efficiencies save operational cost for VIT as well as 

for its tenants.

Nearly half of VIT’s property portfolio is on sale and leaseback 

agreements with limited or no operational control. VIT’s 

approach is to engage these master tenants and encourage 

them to adopt environmentally efficient practices.

EnVIRonMEnTAl PERFoRMAnCE

VIT monitors the environmental performance of the 

properties where it has operational control. This report 

includes our energy consumption, carbon emissions, 

water usage and electronic waste.

VIT has started measuring and monitoring general waste 

at VbP. This will enable us to report the general waste data 

in our next Sustainability Report. 

GREEn BuIldInG

In Singapore, buildings are the third largest contributor to 

the nation’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Ensuring energy 

efficiency in buildings is vital to support Singapore’s 

climate change mitigation efforts.

Two of VIT’s properties in Singapore are certified green 

buildings. UEbH business Park Component is awarded 

Green Mark GoldPlus, and UEbH Hotel Component 

is awarded Green Mark Gold by the building and 

Construction Authority. In 2017, certifications for both the 

buildings were successfully renewed.

An upgrade of the chiller system at VbP in 2016 has helped 

central air-conditioning improved energy efficiency. VIT’s 

water conservation initiatives include installation of water-

efficient fixtures and digital water meter to prevent water 

leakage and overflow during the 2016 retrofitting work. 

These initiatives enabled VIT to reduce almost 40% of 

water consumption in 2017.

VIT’s other energy efficiency measures include installation of 

motion sensor for the toilet, staircase and common corridor 

lighting, and replacing the conventional fluorescent  

tube lights with energy-saving LED lights in the carpark areas.

hElPInG RECyClE E-wASTE

We also pledged our support in environmental awareness 

programmes through REcycling Nation’s Electronic 

Waste (RENEW) by Starhub. We have placed an e-waste 

collection bin at VbP. In 2017, we helped collect 310.6 kg

We have also partnered with Food bank as part of our 

corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes by 

volunteering in its Food Rescue Project. Our employees 

helped Food bank in sorting and clearing their food 

inventory according to their category and expiry date 

to minimise food wastage.  In addition, we took further 

step by placing food recycling bins at VbP to encourage 

collective participation from tenants.

ouR InVESTMEnT STRATEGy

VIT’s prime objective is to provide stapled securityholders 

with a competitive rate of return, by ensuring stable 

distributions, as well as long-term growth in DPS and 

net asset value per stapled security, while maintaining a 

prudent capital and risk management structure.

The key components of our strategy include acquiring 

growth-oriented assets, active asset management, prudent 

capital and risk management, undertaking selective asset 

enhancement and development projects and strategic 

divestment where applicable.

Our strategy is to source for and acquire assets in 

Singapore and elsewhere in the Asia Pacific region that 

meet the REIT Manager’s investment criteria to provide 

attractive cash flow and yields relative to VIT’s weighted 

average cost of capital, and to pursue opportunities for 

future income and capital growth.

Our asset management strategy focuses on proactively 

implementing measures and working closely with the 

master lessees to improve the returns from the master-

leased properties. Also, the approach includes actively 

managing and improving the tenant profiles of the multi-

tenanted properties.

Measures include active leasing, marketing of any 

vacancies and expiring leases, tenant management and 

retention, mitigating any risks relating to new leases 

and lease renewals, implementing programmes for 

regular maintenance and building upgrades, and asset 

refurbishment and enhancement initiatives.

VIT employs an appropriate mix of debt and equity in 

financing acquisitions and asset enhancements and utilises 

interest rate hedging strategies where appropriate. It also 

minimises exposure to market volatility and optimises risk-

adjusted returns to stapled securityholders.

The REIT Manager can undertake selective development 

activities that can enhance the value of the portfolio, 

including 

build-to-suit 

developments 

should 

the 

opportunity arise.

Conducting strategic review of VIT’s properties and opting 

to divest mature assets as and when appropriate to free 

up capital for re-deployment towards better growth 

opportunities is an aspect of VIT’s portfolio balancing 

strategy.

AnTI-CoRRuPTIon

VIT maintains a zero tolerance policy toward corruption 

and fraud. All employees, including senior management, 

have received training in anti-corruption policy and 

related topics.

Some of the recent training programmes completed by VIT’s 

employees included Anti-bribery and Anti-Corruption, 

Global Fraud Prevention, Anti-Money Laundering, Code of 

Conduct and Conflict of Interest. 

There were no reported incidents of corruption or bribery 

in the reporting period.

SuPPlIERS

We have implemented a vendor management system 

to manage our procurement processes. Our purchases 

are made only from the approved suppliers who meet 

the specified qualifications and hold the necessary 

certifications issued by the relevant authorities. 

In addition to ongoing communication through emails, 

phone calls, briefings and meetings, we organise 

periodic feedback sessions with our service providers 

and contactors on regular basis. We require our suppliers 

to comply with the environmental, health and safety 

guidelines and regulations. 

The management reviews the supply chain policy and 

practices periodically. 

SoCIo-EConoMIC CoMPlIAnCE

VIT is committed to the lawful operation of business 

activities. The management regularly reviews existing as 

well as emerging regulations that apply to its business and 

takes the necessary steps to ensure compliance.

There were no reported incidents of non-compliance with 

socio-economic regulations in the reporting period.
