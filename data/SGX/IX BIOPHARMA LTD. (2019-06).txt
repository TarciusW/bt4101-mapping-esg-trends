iX Biopharma Ltd. (the “Company” or “iX Biopharma”) is proud to present our annual 

Sustainability Report for the Financial Year 2019. We have prepared the report with reference 

to the Global Reporting Initiative Standards (“GRI Standards”). The GRI Standards were 

chosen as they are the first global standards for sustainability reporting. The GRI Content 

Index on page 12 and 13 indicates the full list of GRI references and disclosures used in this 

report.  

 

The report is also aligned to the SGX Sustainability Reporting Guide set out in Practice Note 

7F of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Manual 

Section B: Rules of Catalist. 

 

The report captures our environmental, social and governance performance from July 2018 

to June 2019 (FY2019) with historical performance data (“FY2018”) included for comparison, 

for all our entities.  We divested our laboratory testing business under Chemical Analysis Pty 

Ltd during FY2019 and accordingly excluded its performance data from this report. The 

scope and content boundaries of the report have been defined based on the four GRI 

Principles – stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context, materiality and completeness.

Sustainability Board Statement  

GRI 102-14  

 

 

iX Biopharma is proud to publish its second sustainability report following our inaugural report about 6 months ago. This report captures our initiatives to integrate sustainability across our 

organisation in the areas of environment, social and governance.  

 

Sustainability is integral in order for our business to achieve lasting commercial success. We have embarked on this sustainability journey by looking at our responsibility for the environment 

we are operating in, people in our workforce and innovative products for the healthcare industry. 

 

 

 

Environment 

We are fully committed to our 

environmental initiatives along 

its entire value chain, from 

product development to supply 

of goods. We have identified 

energy as one of the material

or age.  

 

We also value the importance of 

competency and proficiency in 

our workforce in order to ensure 

the long-term success of our 

business. During FY2019 , we 

have invested in training and 

development of our employees 

to enhance their skills and 

capabilities. 

Innovation 

Innovation is the cornerstone of 

the Group and continues to be 

an important driver of future 

growth. We are proud to report 

that 18 products have been 

registered or listed on the

Sustainability at iX Biopharma 

GRI 102-11 | 102-18 

 

Sustainability is integral to iX Biopharma’s business to achieve lasting commercial success. We have embarked on the sustainability journey by looking at our responsibility for the environment 

we are operating in, people in our workforce and innovative products for the healthcare industry. At iX Biopharma, we understand the importance of reducing our environmental impact and 

are committed to conducting business in a responsible manner by supporting the precautionary principle. 

 

 

Sustainability Governance  

Corporate governance is at the heart of our efforts in 

achieving our sustainability goals. We uphold the belief that 

good corporate governance practices are essential in building 

a sound corporation with an ethical environment, thereby 

protecting the interests of all stakeholders. We strive to put in 

place a robust governance framework to maintain the 

integrity, transparency, accountability and discipline in all our 

practices. 

 

The Board provides guidance on the social, ethical and 

environmental impact of the Group’s activities and oversees 

the monitoring and management of material sustainability 

issues and their performance indicators.  We consider 

sustainability issues relating to the environment and social 

factors as part of the Group’s strategic plans. The 

Management under the guidance of the Board is committed 

to integrating best sustainability practices into the Group’s 

working environment and business operation. 

 

Supply chain 

GRI 102-9  

 

As we are accountable to our stakeholders, we endeavour to 

ensure that appropriate risk management, key internal 

controls and procedures are in place during the procurement 

of goods and services. 

 

As at end of FY2019, we have a pool of approximately 260 

active suppliers, including contractors, clinical research 

organisations, professional consultants, and financial 

institutions which are mainly based in Singapore, Australia, 

China and USA. In the future, we aim to embed sustainability 

measures into our value chain and integrate environmental 

factors wherever possible and appropriate.

Materiality Assessment 

GRI 102-46 | 102-47 | 103-1 

 

 

Informed by GRI Standards, iX Biopharma has undertaken a 

detailed process to identify, prioritise and validate the 

environmental, social, governance and economic issues that 

matter most to our organisation. Our 2019 Sustainability 

Board Statement and peer research are also referenced in this 

assessment.  

We conducted a materiality assessment workshop with our 

internal stakeholders. They were given a list of material 

sustainability topics identified by peers in their sustainability 

reports as well as working definitions to aid in the 

identification process. This was subsequently assessed for 

relevancy to both our stakeholders and the environmental, 

social and governance impact of our business operations.

GRI 103-1| 103-2 | 103-3 | 201-4 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

The Company’s core business is focused on the 

development and commercialisation of innovative 

therapies for improving the quality of life. This is very 

much aligned with the objectives of the government to 

develop innovative products. We have received 

recognition and support from the government in various 

ways as mentioned below.  

 

We also believe that because we are provided with 

government support, our activities are creating value for 

the community.  

 

 

 

 

 

Our approach to managing  

We have proper practices in place to 

administer the grants and funds received. 

We consistently provide updates on the 

outcome of the programmes and how the 

funds were utilised to the necessary parties.  

 

 

 

Environment 

Energy 

GRI 103-1| 103-2 | 103-3 | 302-1 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

We are aware of our responsibility towards the 

environment. Our choice of efficient and clean sources of 

energy has the potential to the minimise the impact of 

our operations to the environment. As climate change 

continues to be one of the most pressing global issues, it 

is our duty as responsible corporate citizens to do what 

we can towards the global agenda of protecting our 

planet.  

 

As we transition from a R&amp;D centric organisation to a 

business that includes manufacturing and supply, we 

expect our environmental footprint to increase 

accordingly.  

 

Our approach to managing  

In our daily operations, electricity, which is used to power 

our office buildings, manufacturing plant and laboratory, 

contributes to the majority of our energy consumption. 

We use fuel for our backup generators; however, the 

consumption is negligible.  

 

We look forward to sourcing for more energy efficiency 

improvements that will help to cultivate good practices 

across our organisation to save energy. We will also seek 

to invest in practical solutions to mitigate and prevent 

adverse environmental impacts. 

 

 

 

Although Chemical Analysis was divested from the Group during 

the year, it remains as a tenant at the same site until September 

2020.  For the purpose of this report, environment impact is 

measured on site wide basis as energy consumption excluding 

Chemical Analysis cannot be accurately measured.    

 

Energy consumption increase is in line with an increase in our 

manufacturing activities during the year.

GRI 103-1 |103-2 | 103-3 | 416-1|416-2 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

Our aim at iX Biopharma is to develop products of highest 

safety and quality standards. 

 

One of our top priorities is the safety and wellbeing of our 

customers. To ensure the quality and safety of our products, 

we have integrated quality standards, procedures and 

monitoring systems across our operations. All of our 

products are continuously assessed for health and safety 

impacts across our value chain. 

 

Our approach to managing  

As a pharmaceutical company, we comply with all relevant 

and material regulations and applicable industrial standards. 

We have incorporated procedures throughout the 

manufacturing process from raw materials sourcing to 

vigorous product testing. 

 

We have a dedicated Quality Assurance team to ensure that 

all materials used meet the necessary specification for all 

products. Some products undergo clinical trials, where the 

safety aspects are assessed. We have also invested in the 

implementation of a pharmacovigilance monitoring system 

to handle feedbacks and recall events. We have in place an 

adverse effect management programme. 

 

We adhere strictly to government regulations such as 

Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990 of Australia, PIC/S 

Guide to Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal 

Products, Australian Code of Good Manufacturing Practice 

for Veterinary Medicines, and Therapeutics Advertising Code. 

This is made possible by having a robust Quality System that 

is focused on on-going monitoring.  Our Quality Assurance 

team constantly reviews our procedures, processes and 

quality of our products to ensure quality and compliance. 

 

We also review our compliance with Therapeutic Goods 

Administration (“TGA”) requirements from manufacturing to 

product and labelling standards for our pharmaceutical and 

nutraceutical products. As at the end of FY2019, two of our 

pharmaceutical products for erectile dysfunction were 

registered with the TGA.  In addition, all our nutraceutical 

products sold in Australia are listed on ARTG. 

 

As part of our commitment to our customer health and 

safety, we strive to achieve:  

• 

zero cases of non-compliance with regulations and/or 

voluntary codes concerning the health and safety 

impacts of products 

• 

full assessment of health and safety impacts of all our 

products for improvement 

 



FY2018 and FY2019 

 

No cases of non-compliance with regulations 

and/or voluntary codes concerning the health 

and safety impacts of products 

 

All products (pharmaceuticals and 

nutraceuticals) are tested prior to release and 

assessed for improvements

Social 

Training and Workplace Diversity 

GRI 103-1 |103-2 | 103-3 | 404-1 | 405-1 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

We value our employees as the key pillar for our long-term 

success. As an equal opportunity employer, we aspire to be 

the workplace of choice for our staff. We strongly believe in 

being inclusive with regard to hiring policies.  

 

We recognise that our employees are instrumental in the 

success and growth of our Group, and we are dependent on 

the quality and skill of our employees to resolve issues 

raised by our customers. 

 

Our approach to managing  

We employ the best talent, without discrimination on the 

basis of race, gender or age. We have policies and practices 

in place to ensure fair hiring and equal opportunity.  

 

Diversity is an integral part of engaging with the 

communities we work in.  While it is important, merit and 

competency of employees is also a key factor for the success 

of our business. We have in place multiple training manuals 

and systems for all our employees. 

 

The training systems ensure that all personnel are trained 

and deemed competent as required by their position 

description, assigned roles and responsibilities, and where a 

training gap exists, a plan is in place to close the gap. 

 

We hope to provide more training opportunities for all our 

employees in the upcoming year.

 

 

 

Safety, Health and Environment  

GRI 103-1 |103-2 | 103-3 | 403-2 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

Our employees are our most valuable asset. Therefore, our 

success depends upon ensuring a safe and conducive work 

environment for them. Our goal is to improve the work 

environment for our people by reducing risks, preventing 

diseases and fostering their physical and psychological well-

being. 

 

At our manufacturing units, we work with active ingredients 

some of which may be highly toxic. In case of lack of 

understanding and awareness, improper management of 

these substances in large volumes can be dangerous for the 

workers and their surroundings. 

 

Our approach to managing  

To ensure the safety of our employees we have put in place 

standard operating procedures.  

 

The Group operates a site-based approach to Safety, Health 

and Environment (“SHE”) to ensure that facilities operate to 

national recognised standards. These include complying with 

government regulations and commitments to continuous 

improvements to health &amp; safety of our workforce at a 

minimum impact to the environment.  

 

A site SHE committee, comprising senior members of 

businesses operating at our Croydon site, oversees the 

implementation of policies and work practices, and reviews 

all reportable incidents and actions being taken. They are 

responsible for reviewing all reported incidents, assess the 

root cause, address safety gaps and ensure corrective as well 

as preventive measures are taken. 

 

The results of the incidents are reviewed monthly during the 

management meeting of respective businesses and quarterly 

at the site with the SHE committee.   

 

 

During the year, no reportable incident has been recorded.

Innovation 

 

 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

Innovation is the cornerstone of the Group and continues to 

be an important driver of future growth. Waferix is a unique 

and versatile drug delivery platform that allows 

pharmacologically active compounds to disintegrate quickly 

under the tongue, reducing 

the effect of first-pass 

metabolism, and resulting in 

higher bioavailability, as 

compared to conventional 

methods of administration.  

 

We have strong R&amp;D 

capability and collective 

experience in pharmaceutical 

technology, medicine 

formulation, clinical pharmacology and drug delivery &amp; 

safety. Our R&amp;D activities are vital to our efforts to maintain 

our competitiveness in the industry as well as to further 

develop better and improved products.   

 

Our approach to managing  

We seek to identify areas of unmet or under-served 

therapeutic need and focus our research and development 

efforts on formulations of pharmaceuticals aimed at 

addressing such needs.  

 

Ongoing product developments 

 

▪ 

Wafermine 

What it is: World’s first sublingual ketamine for the 

treatment of acute moderate to severe pain 

Active compound: Racemic ketamine, currently 

approved as anaesthetic in IV injection form  

Target patient population market: Patients requiring 

pain management following surgical operations, painful 

procedures (e.g. burn dressing changes) and in the 

emergency department 

Clinical development status: End-of-Phase-2 (EOP2) 

meeting scheduled with the US FDA in first quarter of 

FY2020 

Patents: 54 patents granted, 15 

patents pending  

 

Other Uses: Treatment of major 

depressive disorder 

Clinical development status: Phase 

2 - ready 

 

 

 

 

▪ 

Xativa 

What it is: A novel sublingual wafer containing 

cannabidiol (CBD) and other beneficial cannabinoids and 

compounds found in full spectrum cannabis extracts 

What is CBD: CBD is one of the primary compounds 

found in the cannabis plant 

Potential indications: Promising research suggests that 

CBD can help with chronic pain, certain inflammatory and 

motor diseases, appetite, anxiety and inflammatory bowel 

disease, among others. 

Sublingual delivery of CBD: CBD is known to have poor 

oral bioavailability.  As a result, taking cannabis 

sublingually has the benefits of a faster onset of action 

and higher bioavailability. WaferiX, being a validated 

sublingual wafer, provides a more elegant and 

convenient way to administer CBD, giving users a better 

experience. 

Clinical development status: Formulation currently 

being evaluated for use in the treatment of anxiety, 

tremor and chronic inflammatory conditions 

▪ 

BnoX 

What it is: a sublingual buprenorphine wafer for the 

treatment of moderate to severe pain 

Active compound: Buprenorphine 

Target patient population market: Buprenorphine has 

been shown to provide longer-lasting pain relief with 

fewer side effects compared to other opioids. It also 

exhibits a ceiling effect – higher doses do not result in 

unwanted additional opioid effects, including euphoria 

and respiratory depression. Patients are therefore less 

likely to develop addiction and tolerance, while the risk of 

death is also greatly reduced. 

Clinical development status: Completed Phase 1 

Pharmacokinetic Study 

 

We believe that our WaferiX drug delivery platform is suitable 

for the development of other products that incorporate 

active pharmacological compounds (other than ketamine, 

buprenorphine, fentanyl and sildenafil) or different dosages.  

 

We strive to combine innovative formulations and delivery 

systems to produce next-generation nutraceuticals which 

bring visible and perceptible change to improve our 

customers' health on a cellular level.
