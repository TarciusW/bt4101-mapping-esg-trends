BOARD’S 

STATEMENT

Our Board is pleased to present our inaugural Sustainability Report (“Report”) for Sakae Holdings Ltd. 

(“Sakae”). Sakae believes that sustainable growth strategies and practices are important for our business.

The Report includes Environmental, Social and Governance factors (“ESG factors”), that are material to our 

business and ensure that they are managed and monitored for their risks and opportunities on future growth.  

 

For this Report, we strive to provide various stakeholders with insights into our business operations and our sustainability 

efforts and initiatives. We believe these factors - improving customer satisfaction, ensuring food safety, hygiene and quality, 

training and development of our people, safe and inclusive workplace, recruitment and retention, occupational health and 

safety along with well-being of our communities, energy and water conservation and anti-corruption, are critical to the 

long-term sustainability of our business. These factors along with our other material ESG factors are reflected in the Report.  

A sustainability policy (“SR Policy”) has been developed to ensure a more comprehensive and continuous process. 

Besides identifying, prioritising and validating material ESG factors, they will also be monitored and reviewed periodically.  

 

As we continue to develop our sustainability journey and reporting, we would like to thank our colleagues of Sakae 

for their relentless contributions, commitment and dedication, and all our shareholders, business associates and valued 

customers for their continuing support and understanding.

Aligning with our core values, mission and vision, we use these guiding principles in our sustainable journey towards 

our vision. Those material sustainability factors will be driven by our mission or core values towards building strategies 

for our sustainable growth and development.






The Sustainability Report is prepared in accordance with the requirements set out 

in SGX Listing Rule 711B. We strive to provide a balanced view of the matters in 

the Sustainability Report. The Sustainability Report is prepared using the Global 

Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core option. The GRI Standards are used as an 

internationally recognised sustainability reporting framework. Adherence to the GRI 

Standards allows comprehensive disclosure and coverage of topics that inform our 

key stakeholders of our sustainability efforts.

This Report is based on the Group’s financial year ended 30 June 2018. 

The scope of this Report is based on the policies, practices, and performance of the 

Group’s various business segments in Singapore.

9.1 CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

Customer satisfaction is crucial to customer retention. We seek to provide customer service that goes beyond taking and 

serving orders. We view customer service as part of a holistic customer experience that is capable of providing us with 

a distinguishing advantage in today’s increasingly cluttered and competitive market. 

In	alignment	with	one	of	our	mission	–	To	provide	safe	quality	food	with	excellent	service	at	great	value,	we	are	

committed to retain and build a loyal customer base for our long term sustainability by enhancing our customers’ 

experiences through:

(A) PROVIDING EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE

Customer service is the experience we deliver to our customers. It’s the promise we keep to the customer. It’s how we 

follow through for the customer. It’s how we make them feel when they do business with us. 

Our frontline service employees are always the first customer “touchpoint”. We conduct refresher training for them to 

ensure that high service standards are maintained. Our customers can be assured that our employees are trained to 

resolve customer issues promptly and amicably. Also, we have implemented a service recovery programme with close 

follow-up with our customers.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018




(B) PROACTIVELY ENCOURAGING CUSTOMERS TO GIVE FEEDBACK

We value our customers’ feedbacks as they provide us with insight into which aspects of our operations are working 

well and which aspects can be improved. We have multiple channels to gather customer feedback through our sales 

teams, delivery teams, online social media, our websites, and our customer relationship management system that 

allows for analytical understanding of our customers’ preferences. From such channels, we can then work towards 

product and service improvements and enhance our operational effectiveness and efficiencies.

(C) BUILDING CUSTOMER LOYALTY THROUGH REGULAR PROMOTIONS AND MEMBERSHIP PROGRAMME

We strive to improve customer retention and are constantly exploring ways to reward customer loyalty. Regular 

promotions ensure that we are constantly offering something new and special to our customers to meet market 

demands. Customers who are members of our Sakae Card membership programme receive attractive incentives and 

discounts when dining at our restaurant outlets regularly.

9.2 FOOD SAFETY, HYGIENE AND QUALITY

Being an established Food &amp; Beverage Japanese cuisine brand in Singapore, we prioritise and value food safety 

and hygiene by delivering the best to our customers. Serving great safe and high-quality food has always been an 

important emphasis of our business.

(A) OUR STANDARDS

Through the adoption of industry certified standards, we are able to better gauge and monitor the safety and quality 

of our food. We placed much emphasis on consistency and constantly work towards improving food quality standards 

of our products.

Our central kitchen, which supports our food catering and restaurant operations, has been certified Hazard Analysis 

Critical Control Point (HACCP) standard, which prevents and reduces risks in food safety through tight monitoring 

processes.

All our restaurant outlets have achieved ‘A’ Grade certification from the Singapore Food Agency (SFA). Additionally, our 

Hei Sushi restaurants are Halal-certified by Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS).

14

SAKAE HOLDINGS LTD.




Here are some measures that have been adopted to ensure the quality, hygiene, and safety of the food we serve: 

(B) OPERATIONS

We have always been vigilant in our efforts to maintain food safety and quality in our operations at our restaurant 

outlets, central kitchen or production floors.

Measures that we have put in place:

 

(C) FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN 

We recognise that food suppliers play a major role in food safety and quality. As part of our food procurement process, 

our suppliers’ food supply chain must meet stringent food safety and quality criteria. This may involve visits to farms 

and factories where the food comes from. At the other end of the food supply chain, we monitor the feedback from our 

outlet kitchens with regard to the food supplies they receive. We constantly communicate and work with our suppliers 

to remedy any issues that may impact the quality and safety of our food.

With our strong emphasis on food safety and quality, all of our restaurants are graded “A” by Singapore Food Agency 

(SFA) for the overall hygiene, cleanliness and housekeeping standards of the restaurant outlets. We are pleased to 

report that there were no major food safety incidents during the reporting period.



-        All employees that handle food are required to

         attend and pass WSQ Basic Food Hygiene course

-        A manual on food safety serves as a guide for our 

         staff to adhere to              

-        Our internal food safety and quality control team  

         conducts regular checks on product quality and food  

         handling procedure         

-        We regularly send food samples to an 

         accredited laboratory for microbiological testing to 

         ensure quality and safety of our products

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018


















































































9.3 TRAINING AND EDUCATION

At Sakae, people are our Number 1 asset. Every year, we send our people for training and skills development, and 

seek to guide them to be more enterprising and innovative. We started inter-department projects to exchange ideas 

and experience so as to create a think-tank that allows Sakae to scale to greater heights.

We believe in empowering our employees to perform in their jobs through training and education. Equipping them with 

the necessary skills and competencies for their jobs will add to productivity, confidence and work satisfaction.

We attained in-house Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) Approved Training Organisation (ATO) accredited by 

SkillsFuture Singapore since 2006. This allows us to conduct in-house training and assessment of WSQ certified courses 

on relevant job skills and competencies for our employees. Employees who successfully complete the training and 

assessment will be awarded national industry-recognised certification.

All our restaurant outlet employees will attend two parts training programme which consists of WSQ Basic Food Hygiene 

course and also on-the-job training covering key line functions conducted by our trainers in their respective outlets. 

Depending on organisational requirements and staff development programme, we also conduct in-house seminars for 

employees on skills such as customer service, up-selling, supervisory skills and communication skills at our corporate 

headquarters. Furthermore, we encourage and sponsor our employees to attend approved external courses to build 

on their knowledge and skillsets.

9.4 WORKPLACE EQUALITY, DIVERSITY &amp; INCLUSIVITY

Sakae aims to provide a work environment that fosters fairness, equality, and respect for social and cultural diversity, 

regardless of their gender and age. We recognise that people from different backgrounds have different talents, skills, 

and experience. We find ways for them to complement one another at work. We are strong proponents of equal 

opportunity and do not allow for discrimination on any grounds at the workplace.

We value the experience of our senior staff as well as the passion and flexibility of the younger staff. Sakae 

rewards employees based on a series of attributes that include performance, competence, commitment and experience, 

along with Company performance. We conduct annual appraisals for all employees using a holistic set of criteria 

including interpersonal skills and innovation, besides their individual performance indicators based on their roles and 

responsibilities.

In line with fair employment practices, age, race, gender, nationality, or religion preferences do not factor into the 

evaluation of job applications that we receive.

We value everyone’s contributions and we are dedicated to our employee’s well-being. All employees are entitled to 

a range of benefits that promote staff well-being and productivity, including medical insurance and parental leave. 

Sakae ensures that its staff is engaged and rewarded with competitive benefits that are in line with industry standards.

Staff is entitled to exclusive privileges when they dine at our restaurants. For employee engagement, Sakae does host 

various events ranging from Dinner and Dance or family day activities and events for all employees. Sakae hopes to 

forge closer ties with its employees. Our average employee monthly turnover rate is around 5%, due to streamlining of 

outlets during this financial year. 

Remuneration, together with other staff benefits are key factors to retain employees, but job satisfaction is another 

important factor as well. Our staff development program seeks to provide all employees with clear career pathways 

that lead to better job prospects, greater responsibilities, and learning opportunities as well.

We strive to increase employees’ job satisfaction by providing a conducive, open and honest work environment 

and empowering them to make decisions, as well as setting organisational goals. We value our employees’ ideas 

and opinions and have in place appropriate channels to receive their feedback. Our Employee Suggestion Scheme 

lets employees provide constructive input in all areas including the Company’s business and work environment. We 

address these feedback through consultations with employees and Management with a view to implement ideas that 

will benefit the Company’s business and employees. We hope that this will cultivate a sense of belonging and pride 

at work for our employees.

9.6 OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH &amp; SAFETY

 “Achieve Zero Workplace Safety Incidents!”

Sakae adheres closely with the guidelines provided by the Ministry of Manpower to ensure the health and safety of 

our employees. All employees are briefed regarding basic workplace health and safety.

In Sakae, we practise risk management in our daily activities. Risk management is a process by which the Management 

assesses the risks, determines the control measures, and takes appropriate actions to reduce such risks. Risk assessment 

is a key instrument to reduce risk at our workplace. We will conduct risk assessments regularly so as to keep them 

relevant to our work processes.

We also send our employees for safety courses such as occupational first aid course and work- at- height course to 

enhance their safety awareness.  Employees are encouraged to highlight safety and health hazards to the management 

as we believe everyone has a part to play in ensuring workplace safety and health.

In compliance with the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) regulations, we have a Fire Safety Manager (FSM) and a 

Fire Emergency Plan for Sakae Building. Our FSM’s duties and responsibilities include:

For restaurant outlet renovations, we choose appropriate materials such as non-slip tiles that reduce the risk of 

accidents from happening in our kitchen and service areas. This is in addition to our employees having to wear safety 

boots in the restaurant. Renovation workflows are also discussed with relevant employees so as to minimise potential 

hazards. We also choose to work with contractors who have attained bizSAFE level 3 as well.

We recognise the importance of having an effective workplace health and safety management system in place. To 

address this, we adopted a Permit-To-Work (PTW) System. It is a formal authorisation system used to control selected 

work tasks thereby ensuring safe and proper execution of work at the worksite. The system allows all parties involved 

in or affected by the renovations to communicate dangers involved in the work activities so as to enable safe onsite 

execution. 

20

SAKAE HOLDINGS LTD.

-          Preparing the Emergency Response Plan (ERP) in accordance with the guidelines issued by SCDF

-          Forming a Fire Safety Committee to plan and conduct fire safety programmes including fire evacuation drills  

           and Table Top Exercises (TTE) TTE are scenario driven exercises  where participants derive solutions to likely  

           emergency scenarios in the building              

-          Reviewing and updating the ERP annually


















































































9.7 LOCAL COMMUNITIES ENGAGEMENT/CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

Sakae is committed to an active and socially responsible corporate culture. We recognise that long-term success of 

the business is closely related to the well-being of the community which we operate in. In line with our core value 

“Compassion to All”, we hope to win the hearts and minds of the community and also encourage other individuals 

and businesses to give and serve in the spirit of public duty. 

(A) SAKAE FOUNDATION

Sakae Foundation contributes and supports several charitable beneficiaries. We have supported the community through 

sponsorships and visits to various organisations including Radin Mas Senior Citizens’ Home and schools. Our Foundation 

will continue to pursue philanthropic and volunteer efforts, leaving happy frog prints through our involvement with the 

community. We launched our Facebook page - “Project Happy Frog Prints”, with the hope of fortifying our relationship 

with global communities and continue bringing joy, one frog print at a time.

(B) SUPPORTING NATIONAL DEFENCE

We believe that we as a Company can play a part in Singapore’s national security. NS is a vital component of national 

defence. We support our NSmen by implementing NS-friendly workplace policies so that they can focus and fulfil their 

NS commitments.

As a show of support for Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Day, we encourage our NSmen to take part in the SAF Day 

Rededication Ceremonies. In addition, as a form of appreciation towards all of our nation’s NSmen, we also offer 

attractive SAF Day promotions at our dining establishments.

For the Total Defence Awards 2018, as an affirmation of Sakae’s commitment towards NS, our Company was among 

the top NS Mark (Gold) accredited companies and the nation’s Total Defence, we also received the NS Advocate Award 

as well. The NS Advocate Award is the highest national-level accolade that recognises exceptional acts of support 

towards Total Defence and NS. Other accolades that we garnered in the past include the Minister for Defence Award, 

Honorary Member of the Minister for Defence Award (MiDAs) League, SAF Day Certificate of Appreciation, SAF Award 

for Employers and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) Award for the NSmen Employers Commendation Category.

9.8 ENERGY &amp; WATER CONSERVATION

We are committed to protect our environment and are exploring new ways to reduce our environmental footprint 

through energy and water conservation. We leverage on environmentally-friendly technologies and practices to ensure 

that we lessen our operations’ impact on the environment. Our Go Green efforts include: 

(A) LIGHTING

Suitable lightings in our building have been fitted with motion sensors to reduce electricity usage. We have also 

adopted the use of energy-efficient LED lights in our stores as a means to save electricity.

(B) SOLAR POWER SYSTEM 

A 270 kilowatt-peak photovoltaic system was installed on the roof of our building. It has 1,400 solar panels and is 

able to generate up to one-third of the building’s energy needs. With this, it helps to lower our carbon emissions 

and also reducing our energy costs.

(C) RAINWATER IRRIGATION SYSTEM

The prominent water fountain located at the front of our building is fitted to a rainwater irrigation system. The 

feature is thus aesthetically pleasing and environmentally friendly.

(D) SPICE GARDEN

In addition to the ornamental plants that make up the green landscaping surrounding our building, we have 

incorporated a spice garden in the landscaping plan as well. Spices like aloe vera plants, yellow ginger, pandan 

leaves, mint leaves and many other spices that are grown in the garden can be used as seasonings in the 

food preparation. We will constantly study all ways to include the farm-to-fork approach in our restaurant outlet 

operations as well.

(E) KITCHEN EQUIPMENT AND APPLIANCES

We use state-of-the-art equipment and appliances in our restaurant kitchens and central kitchen. Not only 

do they consume less energy, but they also produce less ambient heat and have very low carbon emissions.

9.9 ANTI-CORRUPTION

(A) CODE OF CONDUCT

Our Employee Code of Conduct sets out the standards of integrity and accountability for our employees. All employees 

are expected to adhere to the Code of Conduct while performing their duties and to always act in the best interest of 

Sakae. For example, employees are not allowed to solicit or accept any gifts or gratitude from our business partners. 

Any gift with commercial value that is not refused due to practicality or courtesy must be declared to the Human 

Resources Department for a decision on the treatment of the gifts. Under no circumstances are employees allowed to 

accept cash gifts. 

Employees who are found to have breached the Code of Conduct after investigations will be subjected to disciplinary 

action.

(B) INTERESTED PERSON TRANSACTIONS

Sakae has established procedures to ensure that all transactions with interested persons are reported in a timely 

manner to the Audit Committee and that any such transactions are on an arm’s length basis. We did not carry out 

interested person transactions for the reporting period. The Management and key executives are also required to submit 

a conflict of interest declaration annually for independent assessment to demonstrate their willingness to adhere to 

the conflicts of interest policy.

(C) WHISTLE BLOWING POLICY

Sakae’s Audit Committee has established a whistle blowing policy and formed a Whistle Blowing Committee. Our 

Whistle Blowing Committee comprises of our Independent Non-Executive Directors to ensure an appropriate level of 

management over whistle blowing matters. The Whistle Blowing Committee provides a channel for our employees to 

report in confidence any possible corporate improprieties including corruption. The Whistle Blowing Committee and the 

Board’s Audit Committee are vested with the power and authority to receive, investigate and enforce appropriate action 

when any such improprieties are brought to their attention.
